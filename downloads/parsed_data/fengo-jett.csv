To start out, I've finihsed my upgrade training and scored an 86% on the final test, the highest in my flight (even those who took the test ages ago) So I'm coming home and I'm gunna rip it up when I get there. Make sure to get your name and stop location to the HotLunch Holiday tour 05. 
So I've been on a movie watching craze lately. I was disappointed in Land of the Dead & Starcky and Hutch (couldn't finish the movie) and was very pleased with SAW and the Girl Next Door (TGND). Since wathcing TGND last night my mind's been wandering to all those that I've left behind. Not saying that I'm dead or that they are, it just seems like every year I slip further and further away from those who made my past, those who matter most to me. Now granted I see most of those people almost every day via AIM, but just how many of them remember me? I dunno its got me feeling kinda funny. Maybe its just the natural way life rolls, but I don't want to happen, and seeing how (in my eyes) I've been able to do a lot of things that I should never had been able to do, I should be able to overcome, but lately I just been feeling wierd, like that my brain knows to let things go and that my heart won't let them go. Its hard to explain. ponder on this as I head on my way.

Its been a long time, though it seems like everytime I write i say that but any ways heres the update. ready? cause its a lot to handle- 9 months of 4 years done in military (only an E2 so low man on the totem pole) I do a cool ass job that i cant talk about, I got married to Sarah Hastings on Sept 03 of 2004. and Now I'm here in lovely sunny okinawa. Military life is difficult at best, it still escapes me that although I'm serving my country I'm like a second class citizen, but oh well I guess cause when i get out big work in my field, that is if I dont just settle in to LAN Mines areana. What you dont know what LAN Mines arean is?

"event","well im about 2 months away now, till I head down to texas for basic training. i've been keeping my self very busy gaming and hanging out and such. looking at the replies people left in my journal, I was very suprised to see a few of the people, people who were once a huge part of my life, and sadly now are not much more the a memory. I found out the other day that one of the two men that were like a father to me when I was younger, had undergone surgery last week, so I visted him today. Mr. Hobel is doing well, and is in good spirits, which was a huge relief to me. I'm now gunna continue where i left off last time.
Rob- you were like a brother to me, we did so much together it's incredible, just to even look back- all the car rides for wargames and scouts, all the deep, profound talks while hiking up mountains, and all the wonderful times we just hung out.
Mike- Next to Bill you're one of my oldest friends. Its a shame we stopped hanging out for so long, cause you were a great friend, all those new years eve wrestling match, and thw swf. no matter where we were, we were always having fun.
Lisa- stupid art major beating me for the pink shirt award :( we had some fun times, like when I came up to boston to see you and we had a really late night stroll to get back to your room ( stupid curran look a like) you were a good sport, even when I called you dad a robot, but you were sure to get back some how.
Kaes- my teacher, my mentor, my friend. All the car rides of just me and you and teh amny misasventure no matter where we were will always be with me. it has been a balst to hang out with you, no matter where we were or who was crying/ being fussy ( his kids not me)]
Jeffro, you are the king of the squirrels and good friend. the mere fact that you could take a really wierd idea and make it a cool, deck was awesome. 
Dave, gay bill, and tyler- you're asll newer friends, and mainly my lanning buddies, but in the few times we've hung out we've had some amazing times- Thundercock, and Hot Lunchvs Chair rapist and Griever"

"event","I've been doing a lot of thinking in the past few days, and I've come to some very valid points, and some not so valid points. and I guess i feel the need to put some stuff down in writing where otheres can see these things. first off the smallest part- I'm official an airman in the US airforce, i ship out for basic training on april 27th, Ill be in texas for 6.5 wees and then i hould hav comute acess again. 

second off, I cant stop thinking about mistakes in my past, many that i now regret deeply. im not usually one to dwell on these sorts of things but I just wanted to say that im sorry to the follow people- Lindsay, Ahu, Katrina, Celia, Kendra, Stacy, Sarah. 

thirdly, i was looking through my buddy Dave's profile, and he had written a piece in his profile about his friends, and thanking them for last year at school. And for some reason it really struck home with me, and it makes me want to do something a bit more ambitious then that, so here wwe go ( and if I skipped you, its not intention, plz just lemme know and ill fix the problem)

Bill- my best friend, I've known you for like forever, we always make the greatest team, no matter what we try to do. but you are still my biddy.
Pete- you are a funny bastard but you are fucked in the head, and need to seek help. You alwya can get everyone to laugh ( or shake their head) and that is an amazing quality. but you're still an art fag
Henry-always the antagonist, your jokes are only crude, and not really that funny. But I still beleive thats from the alien sperm in your body, and the fact your a ""fake"" (according to ""real""
artist friends of mine) artist, using your computer to make amazing pictures.
Jerry- always the serious one, yet in your serious shell i find the best humor. I dunno its wierd. You are missed greatly while you are in Cali. 
Lindsay- My first love, what went wrong? I'll never know, good times though, great times, Jr prom w/ crystal ( :( ) Ill never forget the conversations we had.
Ahu- our meeting was like a dream, our love was something greater, our falling out was the worse.
Katrina- Out of everyone I know i owe you the most appoligies for a multitude of things, you'll probably never read this, but our love was like something out of a fairy tale, and the summer after and times since have been like a neverending nightmare.
Sims- you fat fucking mexican, you were so much like me, that it was scary, we were the true defination of nerds, and no one can change that. you took magic from just being a game to being an unhealthy obsession, but it was a blast and I'd do it again in a heart beat. you will be missed on the playing field. go friday night scary movie night.
Jesus- 1 of core members of josh's unite, your distinct personality was a becon of hope in sim's sea of lard... you will always remain the best noncompetive player I've ever seen.
OJ- the other  core member of joshs unite. man its seems God broke the mold with you, but just duct taped it back up and made me. we're so alike more then anyone else I know, expect that i can win, and you can't. 
Corey- you lived, ate, and slept magic, and that wasnt healthy. we had some fun times, like the scourge prerelease and more.
Justin- you coping bastard, coping my sneak attack deck.. sheesh. D&D was awesome and mech warrior is too. you are one of teh few people I wish I got to know a little better. oh yeah, and your gf is hot ( dont tell sarah i said that)
Joe- the keeper of the ring, you dammed hobbit,  you were by far the king of type 2. playing you was both fun and not fun at the same time. your seriousness to the game is only rivaled by the length of the air on your feet.
Dave- altough you tended to get kinda kooky on us, I owe you the biggest thanks, with out you, I never would have had a chance to meet sooo many wonderful people, and experiance even more. ourt conversations were fun, and playing you was a blast.
Ben- roomate # 2. what can I say about you, that I havent already said to your face to you? Im sorry things diddnt work out thsi year and we couldnt rrom together again, I do miss lounging about in our boxers, playiong comp. games
Murph- man you are an animal, I really wish I'd had rushed when I had the chance, though the frat stuff we did do was awsome.
Sarh G- HAHAHAHA I was the only magic club memeber not to have a crush with you!! no, you were a blast hang out with, even though you hated me but hey cant win them all ey?
Stacy- Wish thinsg worked out better, cause hanging out with you was a blast, you were my savior from the army of Ben & Amber's babies
Adi- You helped get the room to myself a bunch of nights- thanks, no as my roomie's gf you get big points in my book.
Celia- yep I screwed up things big time, i wish I hadnt  but no one is better at screwing up then me. I miss the few times we got to hang out, and the multitude of text messages/ phone convos.
Sarah H- wat can I say babes? you are my svaior from the darkness that was consuming me. thanks for strengtha nd love you gave me, even if I had to fight to get it. Love ya  :)


alright im tired so im off to bed, but I will continue this another time cause there's planty of more people to put up here

and since i am a poet, and well, i'm not really sure what else to write, here i shall write you a poem for your viewing eyes, but mostly for my baby
in the dark of the night
i pray for you to be by my side
sweet and innocent
i want only to wattch you dream
dreams of a life
safe with me
where we can be together
happier then can be
as happy as possible
with my love i send you away
you are my butterfly
i will wait
and when you return
i will know what we have is forever
i thought i had that before
but it was torn away
it was meant to be
and all the tears i thought i cried for him
i was truly crying for you
waiting for you to come my way
waiting to open the door
forever for you
not to shut
till you were safe inside
deep with me
and my life
is now ours
as we share
i give you everything i can
i will bleed for you
breathe for you
hold my breath for you
cry for you
die for you
you name it and i'll be by your side
you name it and i'll be gone
you want me to stay and say the words
you know
i'm telling you now
all you need
is say the words
you name it babe
and you got me for life
my life
and everything it would leave behind
is in ur hands
waiting to be held forever
or simply let go
at your will

Me and sarah are still together, and our relationship is stronger then before. She's at bridgewater state for college so shes wicked close. August had its big up and even bigger downs, but we made it through. At times I feel that I might be reaching the edge of my strength but Im not sure. I start up at Shaws again soon so that will be nice. Everyone's off to school, and thats got me kinda down so that sucks. My birthday is in 6 days, joy. My mom got me and bill tickets to a wwe even which was wicked awesome, ut I think thats gunna be the extent of birthday stuff for me. maybe a few things from the fam but I doubt much more then that, after th elast 2 years of birthdays Im rather unmotivated to try and set up something (boweling w/ lisa and rob and boston with lisa) but oh well. Me and sarah's anniversary is in 7 days. 3 monthst already wow. well I think Im done, theres a lot of stuff to be said but I dont if they will ever be said, who knows we'll just have to wait and see. oh yea and its time to whoop some ass, and I got some one in mind. and he knows who he is and if he happens to read this, YOU'RE NEXT!

Well to quickly sum up stuff: I went to Germany to see my Ahu for 3 weeks, it was awsome except the last week in which some difficulties arose, but I think we cleared them up. I got back and now Im at school again, It was nice to see everyone again. I think im in a good position to get the OL spot I want.

Well today's entry is gona be kinda long. Well the biggest thing is that Katrina is again really pissed off at me. I kinda let a bunch of people know that her (again) ex-boyfriend Joe and her best friend Sarah (whom she now has said is ugly) are kinda hooking up.(whoops I did it again :) ) Which I don't understand why she's soooo pissed about it, I mean as much as I hate Joe, he's put up with a lot of crap on her account, first me the jeff, then derrik, then eric. I mean come on. Well in other news we held our first D&D meeting tonight. 9 people showed up, and I think I've got 10 people right now who want to actively play. Well Amber was a beast again, ann yet again over a petty thing like going to the store. Stacy and her had planned to go out, then after lunch Stacy invited me to go, Amber got wicked mad over it. So she hasn't spoken to me since. Speaking of Stacy, I'm starting to get worried about her. I can tell from talking with her, her body language, and her online diary that she's ahving some big problems, but I'm not sure why, I have a few ideas, but im keeping them to meself. (Don't want her to get ready to kill me too cause of me big mouth) well I'm still looking for a car :( . Tommorrow is Mech Warrior. I shall lead the Dragon's Fury to victory!!!!! well gots to bounce. Im out Yo"

The second weekend we tried to go (first weekend in Oct.) I went to 4 tournaments on that Sat. 3 Magic and 1 Mech Warrior. I won teh Mech Warrior by default. Hurrah!!!!!! Well I've been keeping myself busy here at school. Last weekend I went home. My car broke down, so right now I'm carless :( . On Saturday I went to teh movies with Katrina. I got to say alot that was on mind to her, so it was good, but I don't think a lot of it sunk in with her. On sunday I watched the Packers kill the Pats 28-10. Brett Farve threw his 300th career TD pass!!!! I also saw Red Dragon with Robbie that night. I again tried to go out with Emily but shes always too busy. oh well c'est la vie (thats life) I'm wicked pissed cause they cancled the showing of The Bourne Identity, and I was wicked psyched to see it. Me and Stacy were going to go but then they cancled. Oh well, Today is Laundry day and MAGIC!!!!!! Also tonight Im going to the Mech Warrior Campaign. The Spirt Cats shall prevail!!!!!

"event","September 11th, one year after. For today's posting, im just going to post my piece from English class:
   One year after a great tragedy, I find myself in a state of mixed emotions. On one hand I feel the loss of all who were killed. Especially the one I knew, Mike McGinty. Yet at the same time I am angry at their deaths, that there are so many families left again to grieve on the death of a loved one, takedn so cruelly. I feel a feeling of joy, for my friend Dave Markowitz is alive this day, if for no other reason then he took a new way to work. I am instantly humbled by the though that had Ahu left just 1 week later, that it may have been her plane that was hijacked, and her name would be on a memorial rather then an email. Outrage fills me at those who complain about the government and it's military spending and actions. Do they not know that there is a price for freedom? would they rather more bombing s and attacks? I was too young to understand previous bombings, and I wasn't alive for Pearl Harbor. But when 9-11-01 came around, I was alive and I do understand.

"event","Wellits been awhile. but I've been busy, lets see Wednesday was a hypnotist and then a capture the flag game with Sigma Tau Gamma. Thursday's midnight kickball was a bust, though it was still funny. The foam dance was fuckin awesome. On Sat I went into Boston to visit Lisa, We went to a music show that wasn't too bad, though i liked the opening band more. the best part of the evening was this tall Curran look alike in our group. Sunday was my birthday and yet again, only Ahu and my family remembered, though when I reminded people of it, they did say something which was nice. Oh yeah, I also missed my train on sunday so i had to wait 1.5 hours at the station, that suxed. today wasn't too bad. Though Funny thing happened. Katrina emailed me, and asked me to call her, intreged i did so, and we talked for awhile, which was kool I guess. any ways, the pats game is on, and it sounds like they're winning. Cya"

"event","well the move in yesterday went well. My family didn't embarass me which is very good. Today was a big disappointment, i went to wlamarts and bought a printer cord, hooked up teh printer, and it won't work, so right now im shit outta luck i guess. Also it seems that when u go to college, you can be an ass to your old friends, or so im finding out. well whatever. i found out where chris's room is, but when I went down, i didn't see him, so ill try tommorrow. Steve is cool, as far as i can tell, but he's seems to be regreting staying on campus, and im pretty sure thats partially because of me. oh well, i don't care what he thinks. well im gonna go see if i can go find someone to hang out with. ttyl"

Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and tonight I'm hanging with the guys. we've started Jerry's D&D campagin and its awsome. Jerry always does a good job. He will be missed as he returns to Stanford on tuesday. The other day I gave in to Rob and installed Max Payne on my comp, and I haven't stopped playing it since. Well yesterday I called Ahu again, and we talked for a while. Its nice especially since I can't be with her and I know it hurts her as much as it does me. Also last night I saw XXX with Lisa, not a bad flick all in all. A couple of good one liners. Lots of killin. well once I hit college (sunday) ill write more. Till all are One!!!"

"event","Well to say yesterday sucked, would be an understatement. After work I went to the bank, cashed my check then headed down to Route 1 S, near the mall, where I thought there was a best buy, well I didn't find one, and on my way home up 95 N, I got into an accident, which officially is my fault, but it was the dumbass State Trooper, siting in the median with his lights on that I believe caused the accident. Oh well I didn't manage to get much else done that day, as I went to bed at 12 noon, and didn't wake till 9, still tired, so I called in. But that was yesterday and today is a brand new day. Lisa comes home today, which is cool I guess, hopefully she do the henna stuff we've been planning for like 3 months. Ahu gets home on Sunday which will be nice. Tommorrow I'm going to Bill's to tape our Star Wars movie, and I've gotten a promotion, Now I get to play the Bounty Hunter, and Although he dies, he does win a few fights, which is a change from my normal characters in movies we make (hmmmmm) Oh well I'll try to write more later, till then Live for the Moment"

"event","Wednesday:
Went to Emily's house that afternoon before church, hung out a little while, then got ready for church and met up with Grant. There were only like 10 people in the church because everyone else was at Wild week. But that was ok, it was a short service then me, emily and grant went to the swings. Grant managed to give me 17 new bruises since last time, but it's Grant thats just who he is. Then his mom and picked him up and me and Emily went driving around a little bit, Realized that there was no one to hang out with, then went to Wendy's for some food. Still bored we went to Grant's house afterward and I sat in his lap, Lol! we stayed there until 9:30 and went to Jonathans house before I had to go home.

Thusrday:
Me and Grant had a date that night, so to be sneaky I yold my parents I was spending the night with Emily (which I was!), and that we were going to go see a movie. Emily and her cousin were going to see the later showing of The Longest Yard and me and Grant were going to see an earlier one. But I didn't talk to Grant until later and found out... he couldn't go. So, me, Emily and her cousin Elizabeth saw the movie together instead. Ten i spent the night and 'helped' babysit the next morning. I accindentally fell sleep, whoops!

Friday:
After me and Emily get done babysitting, we decided to go to the movies again at 7o'clock, problem was, it was 2 in the afternoon. so we drive around for a few hours and then Jodie calls me, asks us to come over and hang out, Yay! I hadn't seen Jodie in ages! So we go over hang out for the rest o the time we have and Jodie decides she wants to go to the movies with us, More Yays!! Then I'm talking to meghan on the internet she wants to go to, Yipee! So I'm recruiting people everywhere to go to the movies. Then we get ahold of Grant it took a while to get him to say yes but he finally agreed to go too. So we get there, Grant hasn't srrived yet so we do the mean thing and buy him a ticket to a chick flick, Lol! The whole night consisted of throwing things at each other, talking during the movie And the people behind us yelling. It wasn't as much fun as I hoped b/c there wasn't any alone time for me and Grant, but still fun all the same.

Now:
I've been sitting at the computer for hours, had nothing to do, I'm pissed and don't know why -no it's not my period-, and I'm bored out of my mind! Parents went to a wedding, and told me to get ready to go out later. I got ready, they got home and told me I was crazy and that they didn't tell me to get ready and that there was no way in hell that we were going out anywhere. So I was like crap, I got ready for nothing. So then I watched Joe cartoon all day, and my kness are killing me. Well thats it for now. See ya! <3"

"event","It may not have been the most romantic movie, sure we weren't alone, but there's no denying that it was one of the best days I've ever had. We went to see Star Wars, his friend Reid and my friend Carrie were with us. Carrie and Reid sat on the row in front of us and me and him sat in the very back in dark corner. We talked a little, called each other idiots, and then laughed about it afterward. He smelled the best ever, I was nervous before we got there, but the moment that he hit me I knew things were back to normal, lol. We had always been good friends and I never before thought if him that way until now. I layed me head on his shoulder, he layed his on mine, and stayed like that for what seemed forever. It was one of thebest moments ever, I didn't want it to end but I knew it had too. We didn't hold hands or kiss but that didn't really even matter, what mattered was that for once in my like I felt comfortable and happy. I'm glad that it happened before we lost our chance. Thank you for an Awesome night. I love ya!"

"event","Today was a sad day, it was Halie Lawrence's funeral. She was a month and 7 days older than me. She had a wreck in her 2003 fire red Mustang. It was a sad, sad thing walking into the funeral home, people crying everywhere, her Grandmother so sad and weak from crying nearly fell to the floor. The Hewitt Trussville High School band was there to play a song in her memory, but most were too sad to even finsih the song. There were principal's, and teachers and parents and neighbors. Everyone just seemed to gather into one room, not one person from Hewitt was missing. I just wish it didn't have to end so suddenly."

As soon as I walk into that gym I'm going to hug every single one of my friends, even if those friends hate me and can't stand the site of me right now, I'm going to hug'em. I miss everyone of them so much I can't stand it. I want to see Jodie, hug her give her her souvienire from Texas, she's probably going to think I got it for her b/c I'm in trouble or something but when I got that for her I didn't think she was all that mad at me but I just don't care what she thinks about that right now all I care about is if she still wants to be friends. I'm not going to spend the rest of my sophmore year trying to convince her to be my friend again if its not going to happen and waste my time and life. The truth is though if she says she doesn't want to be friends anymore it'll crush me. So thats all for now, wish me luck."

The entire time I'm there all I can think about is her and how much I miss her and when I get back I get this bomb. Not a single thing is going right in my life and I just want to scream at her fro treating me this way. I want to hug but then again I want to puch her until she feels as bad as I do now.

We're not mad at each other anymore.., actually everything is peachy between us! But poor Yoda can't get a break, she and Jordan broke up and I feel badly for her. I know what I typed last but I didn't really mean it, I was upset but I had no reason to be. But Jordan did something totally inexcusable to Jodie and now I'm going to drive my spiked heel through his thick head. I can't believe he hurt her like that. I refuse to let him get away with it, if I see him tomorrow I'll kill him. No one hurts my friend like that. I still want to be his friend even though that does sound weird after the whole wanting to kill him thing but he is a ok person from time to time. But just b/c I want to be his friend doesn't mean I'm going to let him get away with this. My loyalty lies with Jodie and always with Jodie.

You see there is this guy that I liked at the beginning of the school year, Jordan. Well Jordan liked Jodie and I didn't want to ruin both of their lives keeping them apart so I did what a good friend would do, I stepped aside and let them do their thing. And for a while I still liked him but not much, I was a little mad too, but I didn't let it get to  me. But when that friend betrays you and starts making out with that guy right in front of you, don't you dare think everything is going to be fine and dandy! I was giving them both a ride home Monday when we were sitting in the car and they start playing and laughing and blah blah blah. When they start kissing a little. That is about when I got ticked. I didn't want to say anything to Jodie but it kinda came out. And well, this is what she wrote in HER live journal..: My best friend pierced my heart badly yesterday, I cant believe she would ever think I would do something like that to her. It hurt because I knew how very wrong she was:.. Well I got a little ticked AGAIN! *sigh* She can never think about anyone but herself and it is driving me insane. If I tried to explain to her how I felt she would only turn it around on me and say it was all my fault, that I was the one that insisted that she go out with him. But its not even about him, its about what she did to me, her friend. Well thats all for now."

But i had to take the 10th grade writing assesment test and I flunked it, well I don't know for sure but I would bet on it. And then right after I was done I found out why my friend Angie was absent all this week and part of last week. Her died had a heart attack and died 2 days later. I feel so bad b/c we haven't been real good friends for a while you know we like drifted appart. Then this terrible thing happened and I don't know what to do. Talking to her bout it would make her think about it and make her hurt more, and well I can't come up with any good ideas and it makes me so mad at myself. I've known her dad since i was 4 and he was more like a father to me than my own. I saw my dad every day and I saw this guy mabye 3 or 4 times a month and he meant more to me than my own dad, and I just don't know how to respond. I nearly broke down so many times today, people what was wrong all concerned, I would tell them that a guy that I knew since I was 4 died, they would suddenly get quiet and say I'm sorry almost in the most unconcerned voice possible and that made me so mad I wanted to strangle them. I went to Jodie's after school b/c I just didn't want to deal with my parents, and then when my dad picked me up (He knew about it b/c my mom told him) my dad was actually TRYING to make me cry. He wanted me to cry! That pissed me off SOOOO much I would have strangled him if he wasn't driving. There is just so much about today that i can't even think straight right now."

Jodie went so that she could see Jordan, but he yet again managed to make a bigger ass of himself and didn't show up so Jodie was pissed b/c of that, so we left and went to her sisters house. Which I thought was funny b/c before I left home to go to the concert my mom asked me if I was leaving the church, I told her I wasn't Jeremy and don't do that,( Jeremy is my older brother who might actually be a bigger ass than Jordan).

But in the gym before school, I was really bored so I read in my book, and then Tony came in and sat next to me the entire time! He asked me when we were going to have his Army of Children and I told him,"" Well we could have started last night but you never showed up! Are you cheatin on me with someone else?"" He told me no of course, and then he said e was sorry and that he loved me LOL, I told him he better love me if I'm giving birth to 14,000 of his children! LOL. Then he offered to take me to Micky D's for breakfast but I declined his offer, but he was so sweet! He's such a great friend! I was in photography today and Justin was in there. Well I looked over and there he was with his shirt pulled up and i got a glimpse of his abbs! OMG, I have never seen a body like that before, that g/f of his is one lucky bitch, I'm tellin ya!

"event","Well today was pretty great! Tony didn't exactly hug me but it was close enough for my liking :). And today I actually skipped part of 4th block, can you believe it?!?! It twas pretty cool. Speaking of cool, all the coldness coming from Justins shoulder has eased up a little but still a little icy, not too bad though! Jodie is all full of excitement because tomorrow her squeeze is coming back from reach and she is oh so excited about it. Nothing much really happened though I was really excited about the skipping thing because I have never skipped before. And I was oh so cool about it too, and not only did i get me out of 4th block but also Jodie and we talked a little until we had to go back. I am sooo guy crazy now, all last week the only thing on my mind was Justin and now I can think of Tony and only Tony. I can't wait till tomorrow more hugs for me!"

"event","I know that I didn't have anything typed yesterday but that was because I typed but it just didn't save or something. Today was Grrreat! Tony, my buddy, hugged me and told me that I was the most beautiful woman in the world and that he loved me and that he was going to marry me and I was going to have 14,000 of his children.. it was great. Justin, the guy I like, didn't ignore me today and that was fun stuff! But still nutten goin on between us. :( Oh well I'm not that sad about it, and I don't want to be sad about it. Jodie is so happy because Jordan is coming back Thursday and she is so excited by that! Jordan is Jodie's boyfriend and my buddy. I'm going to church tomorrow but I don't really want to go, but oh well it doesn't matter I'll go anyway. Well I'll talk to you tomorrow!"

"event","Well, home again home again. I woke up about 2 hours ago, about 8:00. You have no idea how abnormal that is for me. But i woke up at differnt times this morning, once when the cat was breaking everything in my room, another when my dad woke up at 4 to watch tv on full blast, a few more times by the cat and then my mom decided to vacuum  at 7 in the morning i got pissed and just laid in bed until my parents yelled at me to get breakfast. I got so mad i yelled at them to shut up, went down stairs got up into their faces screaming at them, and all of this was going on while my throat burned with pain, my nose ran all over the place and I had a headache from hell. Although afterward I was proud of myself that was the second time in my whole life that i actually yelled at my parents! And I didn't get in trouble for b/c I was sick (and apparently) I didn't know what i was doing...? Oh well, didnt get to go to the movies yesterday but my parents thought we might be able to go tonight. I dont believe them but whatever, I just dont have enough energy right now to fight with them. On other news my friend Jodie is sick also, she's worse then me and I really hope she gets better, but she probably doesn't b/c she doesn't want to go back to school. Lately when I talk to her on the internet she doesn't like to talk to me or something b/c she never talks to me, I think shes mad b/c of something I said the other day, but she said she wasn't mad about that, know I just don't know what to do. Do you think thats enough to talk about right now?"

"event","Well, Mummy and Daddy didn't feel like going to a movie so we just stayed home..... AGAIN! Oh well, doesn't really matter, I got to see Kill Bill, volume one AND volume two! I thought the first one was better b/c... well b/c it was funnier. I think it was funny b/c of all the bad acting, LOL! But the second one was funny too b/c Darryl Hannah(don't know how to spell her name)got her other eye ripped out. The only other thing i have to tell you is that i went to Surin West for lunch and got some coconut soup for the first time in about... 3 months, it was great!"

"event","Today was boring, i woke up at 8:00 in the morning! I haven't done that in... well, wait i've never done that! 
I went with my dad and Grandmother to find carpet for my memaws house, took a while but we were finally successful! I've been kinda bummed lately b/c of a thing at school, a friend called this guy i like and told him to break up with his g/f(who recently had a car wreak) and go out with me or he would have to quit flirting with me ... and breaking my heart? I dunno. But the guy won't even look at me and its even worse than before. :(. And it just seems like the world that i built for me and made me happy once is just crashing down in a matter of 2 days. I just wish it was wednesday again. Oh well, i might be going to the movies tonight... All depends on how well my mom is feeling, she never feels good enough to go anywhere on the weekends. Hopefully she'll feel different tonight!"

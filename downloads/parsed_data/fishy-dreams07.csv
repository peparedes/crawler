2.so the elaphant said to the camel y do u have to boobs on ur back the camel said thats a petty dumb question comeing from someone who has a dick on there face .

3.An apple a day keeps the doctor away but if the doctor is cute, skrew the fruit. .

4.Happiness is like peeing in your pants, everyone can see it but only you can feel the warmpth!

5.When Life Throws You Lemmons... Stick Them Down Your Shirt And Make Your Boobs Look BIGGER!! .

6.What did one saggin boob say to tha other??.. think about it... If we dont get some support soon people are gonna think were nuts.!!! :-) 

7.Holy mother, full of grace
Bless my boyfriend's gorgeous face
Belss his hair that tends to curl 
Keep him safe from all the girls 
Bless his arms that are so strong 
Keep his hands where they belong
Bless his di*k, the one I sucked 
Bless the bed, in which we fu*ked
And if my mom happened to walk in 
Bless the sh*t I would be in 

8.frindz r like condoms they r always around when thinks get hard-lol i love u guys....

14.I didnt know running into the wall would hurt as much as it did. But here I am, laying in a pile of my own blood in a coma, hoping that my faithful penguin sends for help. Last time this happened the penguin just called me a pussy, took my shoes, and went to see ""The Mask."" To this day I still dont know if he liked it, and whenever I ask he just calls me a slut and throws ice cubes at me. .

"event","hey guys sorry i dont update in my journal that much well lets start off on sat. well sat was the bayfest i picked up robyn and matt and my mom took us there when we got there we were looking all over for ""the gang"" lmfao we finally meet up with them there were like a million people there i saw a lot of people that i no ... well they bought these things that shock u and they make ur hand go numb lmfao and yeah well n e ways we all (me,robyn,matt,steve,shanna,dan,KYLE,brady,chris,and dj)went to the pier cause we saw a helicopter and it looked really kool....well we were waiting for mickey to get here so we could do stuff so when she finally came she brought her fire works lmfao and they were water proof so we decided to light them and through them into the water well we did like 2 and they were kool so mickey lite another one well then mickey dropped her brand new phone in the water....o-m-g she was like flipping out she screaming tell people to go get it no one wanted to cause the water was too cold well DJ (the nice person he is) went in ...he was in his clothes and he was saying that water was frezzing so he got where the cell phone dropped and he couldnt feel it he was in there for a good 10 min trying to find the damn thing after a while he found it we were screaming for joy lol and when he came out kyle and brady went to go find a shirt for dj cause he was soaked well when he got out he was cover in this gross muck...when kyle and brady came back they couldnt find a shirt for him so we all just walked around... me and robyn wanted ice cream so bad so we decide to go get some i got chocolate ice cream in a waffle cone lmfao any ways after every one ordered we meet out front so we could decide what to do steve was drinking a coke and brady went up to him and hit it and it got on every body it was so gross i was sticky lmfao  any ways we started walking steve went into this building and kyle was look in the window to see him and i was standing next to him well this old fart came up and grabbed me and pushed me aside and kyle and opened the door and yelled at steve saying ""u dont want to get arressed so get out"" and then he left he hurt me ahh and chris or kyle i dont remember who said next time yell out rape lmfao well then we started back walking it was a beautiful day and so i decide to take off my shoes well kyle chris dan and steve wanted to go to dj's house so we did they got there bikes and started riding mickey,robyn,and some other people wanted to stay at the bayfest but every one was walking to dj so they followed i was wearing kyle's helment (lol i was sexy) lol n e ways we headed towards dj's house and we notice that dj or matt was with us so kyle and chris road there bikes to try to fine them but they didnt so we kept on walking to dj's house out of no where this car started beeping at us and try to guess who was in it .....it was dj and matt.....dj's mom picked them up so every one started running lol we all got tired so we stopped then dj's mom came back to pick us up (she is so nice) well when we got to his house we all sat in his living room and talked while dj's mom was taking out a shell from dj's foot ....ewwwie there was blood every where grosssssss gag me with a fork lol... well steve was reading us a story ""the cat and the hat"" lol and yeah it was ok lmfao any ways while he was reading it chris mickey and robyn bet me to kiss fish on the cheek...i was scraed at first cause i dont want kyle to hate me but as u no i did it and yeah it was amazing lmfao jk well n e ways we all went out side and played then they wanted to go to k-mart every one went besides me,dj,brady,shanna,kate, and joe we were there just talking and putting this stuff on bradys sun burn lol well i wanted to go to k-mart to see every one but mostly kyle....so i walk there by my self and found them kyle had a soda and i wanted on but all i had was a five dollar bill and the mechine only took ones or coins so me and kyle went into the story together every one was in that pizza area and i went to get changed i decided i didnt want a soda so instead i got gum...every one wanted a piece so i gave it to them well so i sat down and watch every one eat pizza kyle was going to buy a pie but he didnt have anough $$ so i gave him a dollar lol and he shared it with me lol any ways while every one was done we went  back to dj and steve finished his story and yeah i was sitting on the floor at the time and i wanted to sit on the couch so i got up and sat there i told kyle to come and he did he sat right next to me i was so happy ...every one started tickleing me and every one no i dont like it so they do it n e ways and they also look at me cause i hate when peopl stare so kyle kept doing that well mickey and robyn told me to kiss kyle i mean fish again so i did lol and i wouldnt give back his stuff like his glasses his helment and his beanie lol (he looked sexy in it) well i put my head on his shoulder and he did the same to me i was like in heaven ahhh lol so yeah then i wanted to go to the other couch and kyle foloowed me and i layed on him i was suprise that he didnt move or n e thing people were asking him if he liked me and he is like "" well im just proving that i dont like victoria willets"" lol lol was a douche jkjk well n e ways robyn and matt and chris had to go ... ::tear:: and all of us that were still there just talked and stuff and called each other on our cell phones lol well then chris came back we wanted to go to the park so we did we after we were there for a while we went into the back of the school and lite so fire works hehe out of no where this 10 year old kid and i guess his brother came up to us and ask if he could smoke weed with us and were like no

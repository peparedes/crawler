"event","I am never going to have kids.

Look at it this way.

They are practically ""novelty"" when they are born. People are all excited, ""oh look how cute he/she/it is !""

Then all it does is crap and cry

Then when it hits toddlerism it never shuts up about that pony/videogame/icecream it wants

Then... when its a teenager it hates you...

Then when its in its early adult hood it begs for money....

Then it leaves you...


fuck that haha"

<small><b>Description: </b>Some Swedish man goes into the future by crawling under his sink and films it.</small>

I am skeptic and stoic on just about every ""mystery"" out there, sometimes even God.


Well....
After I hung out with Shanie today, little baby Zane called and said: <i>""lets go bowling"".</i>

The highlight of the night was when I beat him by <b>1</b> point. 

I seriously broke his heart, and everyone in the bowling alley picked me up and carried me out, cheering.

 Confetti, balloons and banners fell from the ceiling ! 

<i>(I wish)</i>


The score board:

1) <b>Zaney Brainy</b> - 60

2) <b>Alejandro</b> - 61

He called me an asshole.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What else is new ? hmm..

Anxiety... ?

I try not to think about tomorrow and conjure up problems for myself that don't even exist yet. Instead, to beat that anxiety of what <i>could</i> happen, I'll focus on whats happening <i>now</i>.


Anyone else a little stressed about the future ?  haha. I am not just talking to Sabrina here, whoever is reading this, post something :D... Or else.

Or are you the only one who reads this, Sabby ?"

"event","Did you know, if you took tutoring at Sylvan for Math and English, the cost of it would be around <b>$5000.00</b> ?

So, that either means they are over-rated rip offs or....

While you're solving math problems with Albert Einstein you're served fillet mignon and Jessica Alba gives you oral whenever you want...

because damn...

When the manager told me this, I looked him in the eye and with my quivering lip I began crying an ocean of tears.<small><small>not really</small></small>

I could get free tutoring at Dvc but I am too lazy to drive and I am not sure how good it actually is...

Anybody know any decent tutoring schools in Walnut Creek ?

Can I hire somebody ? haha..
I pay well like Donald Trump."

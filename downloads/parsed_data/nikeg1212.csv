It's simple. I really just don't care about anything anymore. 

I suck. I know. People have been reminding me my whole life, so why would I think it would change now? 

I know I'm a difficult person, which is why I hold everything in and try to deal with it my fucking self. Because I don't want other people to get involved, they never understand. And that also sucks because holding <u> everything </u> in just makes it so much harder for the little things. Little things that shouldn't hurt as much as they do to me. I have an underlying HATE for myself, so I take so much to heart. And I worry SO much about how other people feel about me. 

I'm sorry that I'm a shitty person. I'm sorry that I am hard to deal with. I'm sorry that I need my own time to sort shit out in my head. Sorry I'm me. I know everything would be a lot easier if I weren't. 

So I guess my previous statement about not caring isn't true at all. I guess I care too much. Right?"

""I had given up my religion, just as I told Nicholas, but that didn't mean it had given up on me. It was a two-way street: just because I chose not to pray to Jesus and the Virgin Mary didn't mean they were going to let me go without a fight. So even though I didn't attend Mass, even though I hadn't been to confession in almost a decade, God was still following me. I could feel Him like a whisper at my shoulder, telling me it wasn't as easy as I thought to renounce my faith. I could hear Him smiling gently when, in moment's of crisis--like Max's nosebleed-- I automaticlaly called out to Him. It only made me angrier to know that no matter how forcefully I pushed Him out of my head, I had little choice in the matter. He was still charting my course; He was still pulling the strings.""


---------------------------


So I think I'm bi-polar or something. I feel like I don't WANT friends, because I always feel bad when I can see myself cloud over. I feel so awful, but there isn't anything I can do about it. I know I ruin good times..and I know I am stubborn, but inside I can see that I should be smiling. No matter how hard I try, I just can't smile."

Unfortunatly I have come to the decision to call the Humane Society tomorrow and ask them what I would have to do to bring Dozer in. Apparently the last time he got loose, he came home with a huge gash out of his leg. No one called me to let me know..they kind of just left it. He's been loosing a lot of weight and having problems breathing as well. I don't have the money to bring him to the vet. I would like for him to be in a place where they are able to take care of him. Steve is mad at me because I won't let him take Dozer. I explained to him that the best thing for Dozer is not to be in that environment, because whether or not Steve knows it, he is way too harsh on that poor puppy. He has the characteristics of an abused dog because of the way that Steve treated him when we were living there. I'm not going to allow that to happen again, no matter how upset Steve gets. I have been thinking about this for a couple days..and it didn't really hit me until about an hour ago. I was talking to Josh on the phone about it, and I couldn't help but cry :c( I love Dozer so much... I'm so torn about this right now. 

I really can't afford to have another sleepless night. I'm not really sure why, but it has been very hard for me to actually get sleep in the past couple weeks. It is to the point where Big Tim and Dave will count how many times in an hour that I will yawn. Or how long it takes for me to yawn for the first time of my shift. When your sleep disorder becomes a game to other people, you know it's time to do something about it. 

The sketchbook under my desk is housing too much dust. I really want to start drawing and painting again. I need inspiration... I just keep looking at the art work that I have hanging on my wall. Charcoal paintings that I did about a year ago. Painted canvases with emotion spilled on their skin. I miss the feeling of creating something. Even if at that moment, nothing was ever done, or perfect, I still am able to look back at them and feel like I accomplished something. Feel like, at that time I was able to create something unique. I miss being artistic.

Everything is the same every day. Not too sure how much longer I am going to be able to keep it up. I really do need something new in my life. Anything at all. 

As for money, I don't know what I'm going to do. I have been asked to stand in two different weddings, and I'm not sure if I can afford it.

Even though the harassment issue is at an end, I still think about it and the things that she said to me. I know I shouldn't let it settle. Those words were said out of anger, and hatred. She doesn't know me. For all she knows I go mess around all the time. For all she knows I am a slut, and a whore. As for everyone that does know me, they know that I am not even close to any of those things. I don't know why I let things that people say bother me so much. One reason could be the feeling that I get when I know someone hates me. I try so hard to make people happy, and put myself on a back burner. When someone comes around who doesn't see that and doesn't appreciate it, I get upset. 

Aside from that, how do you lay something to rest that is digging away at your brain? How do you forget about something that has happend to you; Something that just blows your emotions away and freezes your blood. This situation is not a good one because I am starting to let it effect my every day activities. As of right now, the results aren't damaging, but pretty soon I feel like I'm going to crack. I just feel so disgusting.

It won't stop poisoning my dreams and my love for Him. I'm not really sure what to do right now. I feel so lost and beside myself. I really miss having those stupid little slumber parties with my High School friends, when we would sit up all night talking about everything and sorting things and thoughts through that we've had stored up in our minds for ages.

I've been talking to my brother Chris a lot more recently. It sucks because before I knew he was going to join the Air Force, I didn't really see him all that much. He was always off doing his own thing, and I was always off doing mine. It never really occured to me, until he told me he was leaving for basics, that he and I were that distant. Hanging out with him is a blast. He's such a great kid.

In these days off, I have been looking up information on Buffalo State. I am really honestly considering going there. I am going to try and find a place to live for 6 months prior, so that I can get In State Tutition, and so that I don't have to live in the dorms. It is actually cheaper than Northern. I'm looking at an Art Education Major and a minor in Photography. I'm not 100% sure on it, but I have decided that I want to do something in the Art department. I was also looking at Creative Writing. I'd love to get back into the groove of writing. 

I'm feeling good about this. Sometime in September, I am getting a bonus check from Wal-Mart. I WAS going to use that to get myself an amazing camera, but I think that I might use it to take a trip to Buffalo and check it out. I want to see the area before I make any decisions. Sounds smart right? haha. 

One thing is for sure...I need to go back to school. I need to do something with my life. And I'd like to start fresh, you know? I think a new environment will be good for me. Room to grow, and meet new people. Maybe it will help my creativity come alive again. haha."

So today at work, to make a long story short, My  managers and I were looking through a shoplifter's Memory Card that was left behind. It made me so sad because some of the pictures were insane. This girl had to have been about 15 years old. She had nude pictures, party pictures, and pictures of *i am guessing* her mom, dad, and brother smoking a bong and a few joints as well. Honestly, I am so lucky to have the parents that I do. I just really can't imagine the kind of parents that would join in on doing drugs with their kids. Grr This world is absolutly CRAZY!

I have some of my artwork hanging in Fran's shop downtown in Ishpeming. I also have some photography for sale at The Treasure Chest (My aunt's store). I got a check in the mail the other day because apparently someone bought one of my pictures from my Aunt. I was so pumped! Right after I got that in the mail, I felt like I was in such a crafty mood. I got out a canvas and painted a picture. I made a necklace with Jamie. I took more pictures to hopefully sell. I am thinking about going into Marquette today to take more pictures, but I'm not sure if I have the gas money for it. haha. We will see though. I also found some new features on my camera that I want to check out, but maybe I can get Jamie to help me with that later! I want a new camera. A really expensive one.

Becca is due to have her baby in one month. She says it will be less than that though :c) Wishfull thinking I suppose. I am getting excited. I can't wait for him to be here. Lately I have been having dreams about random things in the house, and in every dream there is a baby in the background. I am assuming that the baby is Brayden :c) It is wierd though because every time that I see the baby, he looks different. Is he going to have Hazel Eyes like Becca? Is he going to have the cutest dimples in the corner of his eyes like Becca does? I hope so. Will his hair be curly like rest of the Ricketts, or will he be blessed with straight hair? :c) Oh, and I wanted to thank everyone who came to the baby shower.

He was on the computer, and you know there is no inturrupting him when he is talking to all his girlfriends on his VooDoo chat thing. I went there to get some more of my stuff. My car is FULL of junk. I have NO where to go with it! I need my own apartment! Anyway. So I called him before I went there to make sure it was okay for me to get my some of my stuff and he said it was fine. So here I am carrying all these heavy boxes, trudging through the snow and ice, trying to make it to my car without dying, and it doesn't phase him. On the last box, he asked me if I needed help. I was so shocked at the fact that he didn't realize I was having trouble. I just said ""Um. Your pretty busy there. I'll get it"" So he got all grumpy towards me. 

To make a long story short, I ended up leaving his house with a car full of my stuff and a heart full of pride. I laughed at him. I laughed at the fact that I don't have to put up with his crap anymore. I don't have any obligations towards him what so ever. Well I guess I can't really say that. I can't just drop him like that. If he needs my help I will probably do it, just because I hate to be mean to people. But instead of being upset that I had to pack up my car by myself, and upset at the fact that the guy I have loved since my Juinor year at High School is acting like a completly different person....I had a smile on my face. He doesn't own me anymore. 

I can do what I want. And I will. I am going to find myself again. I am going to continue to draw and paint like there is no tomorrow. I am going to write short stories in my journal for no reason other than the fact that I feel like writing. I am going to write HAPPY poems instead of depressing death poems. I am going to fall in love again. I am going to treat this man, who ever he may be, like there is no one else on earth for me. I am going to make him breakfast in bed and he won't make me feel like crap for it. I am going to surprise him with ""I Love You"" gifts and cards. I am going to go all out for him on his birthday to make sure he knows that he means the world to me. I am going to make sure that he is happy, and make sure that there is no doubt in his mind of our relationship. I am so excited to feel the butterflies in my stomach again. I am looking forward to feeling so close to someone that I swear we are the same person. I can't wait for this day to happen, but I will wait as long as it takes for the perfect guy. 

I am going to get to know my friends again. I am going to have fun. I am going to watch movies that I want to watch and I am going to be alone when I want to be. I am going to call people. I am going to put myself into the same world that I shut myself out of when I thought I had what I wanted. I am going to gain my confidence back and keep it. 

I feel so free right now, and I love it!




As a side note: I ran into a lot of people at the Ball Drop on New Year's Eve. I am not a huge partier. I do go to an occasionaly party. I do drink occasionally. But seeing these people that are otherwise calm and collected really hit me for some reason. One of my best friends got sick right infront of me and I couldn't handle it. Why do that? Why do you have to have alcohol to have fun? I'm making a resolution to give up alcohol. I don't want to become the kind of person that needs it to have fun. I dont want to be that person who throws up in front of a group of people and laughs about it. I dont want to be dependent on something that will ruin my life. Any one with me?! We can do it together!"

Isn't it amazing how you think you are alone in the world, and that no one out there has gone through the things that you have. I seriously thought that. I hated when people came up to me and told me to ""Get over it"". It's not that easy. And they shouldn't be saying this to me, because they don't know how hard it is! I love knowing now that I am not alone. I love knowing that there is at least one person out there that knows how I feel, and that can understand my feelings. I always thought my standards were high, because I didn't think there was anyone in the world that fit them. The more I think about it, the more I realize that my standards aren't high at all. I dont want a cheater. I dont want a liar. I want to be with someone that isn't afraid to say that he loves me, and isn't afraid to show me that he loves me. I want to be with someone that will appreciate all of the things that I do for him. I don't want my love to go to waste, because I have a lot of it to give. I know that I deserve better. I know it now. It took a stranger to come along and open my eyes, but I'm glad he did. I am so thankful for the conversations we have exchanged in the past week. haha this wasn't the way I was expecting my blog to go. I'll leave this subject now. 

 

I am ready for a change. Bring it on. I have a newly found confidence, and I am not really sure where it came from. Maybe it's being far away from home for a while. Maybe it's the people I have met. Maybe it's the hope in my heart. Maybe it's because I finally wear the right size bra! lol. I don't know what it is. I just feel good. I feel more than good. I feel spectacular. 

 

It's almost 4 in the morning. I need to go lay down! Maybe I'll get some sleep if I could wipe this smile off my face :c)"

"event","Okay, so did you know that 8 out of 10 women wear the wrong bra size? I didn't either! But today, I had an adventure. I went to this store called Lane Bryant. They measure your boobs for you and tell you what bra size you wear. It was a big uncomfortable at first, but then, it was kind of fun. They measured me, and then got me a bunch of bras to try on, and then they came back and told me which ones looked better,..and which ones gave me better clevage. :c) lol. It was funny. 

Unfortunatly for those of you who are wondering. I will not be reavealing my new bra size, but everyone was quite shocked..as was I. Maybe if you are special enough and ask me, I will tell you. lol. 

Anyway. I highly suggest every girl to go out and get fitted for a bra. Especially if you have big boobs and have troubles finding the perfect bra. It seriously makes a HUGE difference!


I'll be home in a week :c)"

It's saying ""Hey Look at me! I have the internet...but you have to wait for an entire hour for the video to buffer if you want to see it. And you have to pick between talking online and surfing the web because I can't handle doing both of them at the same time."" Grr. I'm trying to talk my sister into getting Cable, but it's no use. It's actually really cheap here, but apparently too expensive for her. 


I kind of wish that I would have brought my own car down here..so that I could leave early if I wanted, and Stop at Alisha's in Grand Rapids, because I am not going to be able to see her for like 2 months :c(


I'm sitting in Annie's office right now....so I should probably go. If you wanna try to get ahold of me or anything, your best bet is to send me a message on Myspace. I check that every night.

"event","I know this wont happen right away, because as of right now, we cant afford it..but there is a possibility that Steve and I may move to the Green Bay area. It would be nice to move out there because then I'd have someone I can rely on. I would love to live by Katie, becuase I KNOW that she wants me around. It is wierd because we live so far away, but she tells me that other than one person, I am the only friend that she talks to. And it's the same with me. Other than my little sister, Katie is the only one that I talk to. I miss having her around because she always understood how I felt. We could sit there and talk about everything to eachother, and both of us understood completely, and that would make us feel a million times better.

There are so many things that I want to type here. So many things that I want to say. I dont want to make anyone angry. But sitting here and waiting for things to happen hasn't helped, so I guess I'm just going to come out with some of it. I feel like I deserve and apology...an apology for everything that has happend since November. I'm talking about a heartfelt apology, with an explaination and everything. I guess after waiting for 8 months, I should just put it behind me, and forget about it...but not this time. I'm tired of always being the one that is left and hurt. You may have gotten over it fine, but I didnt. 

I have come to realize that I am probably more of a nuisance to everyone. I may seem depressed all the time. I know that I never really post ""happy"" journals. but I use this to vent, because there is no one else to vent to. I am not sad all the time. In my life, there is one thing that really upsets me to the point of even using the word ""Depressed"". I am sure that you can all guess what that is. Other than that, I love my life. I am so happy, and content with how things are going.

I am not expecting any comments on this journal, and that is fine. I dont expect people to try to get invovled, when they arnt. I dont even expect an apology, even though it would be nice. So there it is. This thing is wide open, just waiting to be resolved. Dont worry about calling me just because I live with my boyfriend. Ask Katie, she knows that it isnt a big deal...she calls me all the time. I am sorry if I made anyone mad or hurt, but I've had this all bottled up since November...8 long months ago. And I'm tired of not saying anything. I'm tired of pretending like it's normal to talk to you...when you only do it if you come across me in public.

Anyway. I'm going to shut my mouth now, and hope for the best. If that doesn't happen, then I guess it's just time to move on, and maybe it will give me that extra little kick in the ass to pack up my things, save money like crazy, and head out to someplace different."

"event","My birthday was almost exactly one week ago. My mom took me shopping and bought me a bunch of clothes, and then she made the family tacos for dinner, and we had a really yummy chocoalte creme cake afterwards. That was my birthday. Nothing special. Not even everyone in my family came over for dinner, I dont think that Chris even knew it was my birthday. But it was nice..quiet...but nice. Steve's is in a couple days. He already knows what he's getting, so that kind of takes the fun out of it. 

Saturday they are setting off the fireworks in Marquette. I think that we are going to pack up a picnic, go swimming, and grill out on the beach, then wait for the fireworks to start...that is, if the weather cooperates. 

I have the 4th, 5th, and the 6th off this year. I was hoping to go out of town, maybe to the mackinac bridge to see the fireworks. I hear that they let fireworks off from both sides of the bridge...It sounds beautiful. I dont know if I will have the money to do it though, but we will see. Hopefully Steve got those days off too, I would hate to spend the Fourth of July without him. 

I had my 1 year evaulation at Wal-Mart the other day. I guess it went pretty good. I get a $0.40 raise in August, once I acutally hit a year. I'll be make almost two dollars more than what I made at Joseph's. I am still debating whether or not I should quit once minimum wage goes up. I'll be making $0.30 over what I would be STARTING at once it goes up. Depending on whether or not Wal-Mart raises the wages of the associates that have been working there before the increase, I may just have to say goodbye to the Big Smiley face....Oh Well..I dont like doing the Wal-Mart Cheer everyday at the meetings anyways. ""Give me a W! Give me an A! Give me a SHUT THE HELL UP I AM SICK OF THIS STUPID CHEER!!!!!!!!!!"" 

Well, I dont really have much to say. The only reason why I am updating this now, is because I have nothing better to do. I've cleaned the house, done the dishes, and am waiting on the last load of laundry to be done at my parents house. Then I have to go pick up Steve from work at 8. Dinner is almost ready, and for once I am not the one making it, So I am going to soak up as much of this time as I can. 

I hope you all are having a nice summer. Make the best of it while you still can!"

Plus, there is Father's Day, which is TODAY. I bought Mikey a West Coast Choppers hat and he loved it. I love buying things for other people and seeing their reaction. It makes me feel happy. well, unless they totally hate it and throw it back at me, lol, but that has yet to happen. Steve's present isnt going to be paid off right away...It's just going on Layaway, with a 20% off discount, because I know I cant drop $400 right away. An X-Box 360. He'll prolly have a heart attack when he gets it. Anyway, Steve and I are kind of celebrating out birthdays together. We are going to pick a day inbetween ours and go out to eat and what-not, then later that night, we invited a bunch of people to go to the casino with us, so that should be fun. That's prolly all I'm going to be able to do for my birthday, since LYNDA WOULDNT TAKE MY SHIFT FOR ME!!!!!! 


Steve and I are still trying to find a place. Chris (my brother) ended up moving into that house that we were originally looking at. It'll take a while before we can afford anything again...I just got a few new bills that I have to pay every month. Grrr to that.


Other than the bills, things are going really good. I have recently been told by someone that all I ever write about is depressing stuff in my livejournal. I guess that's true, but the thing is, I only write in my journal when I am having a bad day. It is my way of venting since I dont have anything else to vent through. But make no mistakes, I love my life. I am so happy right now, and to those of you who dropped me, dont worry about it, because I have someone that will always pick up my pieces. :c)

Even though we would have to pay for our own utilities, split between 4 people, that is an amazing deal. We saw the house, we liked it, there was even a dish washer in it..which is awesome because I am totally tired of hand washing dishes. But I dotn think we are going to do it. Something just doesnt feel right. I dont want to put myself in the position of living with a lot of people again. That was terrible. I dotn want to end up losing more friends or getting into more fights with different friends, etc. I KNOW I can live with Steve. I mean, I have been for the past 6 or 7 months, and it's been great. I love living with him. We sat down and talked the other night about some pretty deep stuff and it made me very happy. I love this kid to death :c) So I think what we are going to do, is save up some money (because he has a job now), and try to find a place for just us. Our biggest problem is finding a place that will allow our baby Dozer to live with us. But it's okay, because something will come along sooner or later, and when it does, it will make everything so complete! I love him so much!

I am excited for Saturday because Katie Kay might come to visit me. I can't wait to see her and her cutie baby David! I talked to her on the phone for quite a while last night and it felt good to acutally be able to talk to someone like that again. It has been so long since we had our last pow wow in the bathroom that connected our bedrooms in the dorms. I miss her so much!

Well Right now, Steve is at work, and his mom and Wren are in Marquette, so I have the house to myself, and I am going to live it up. I am going to go do whatever the hell I want to do! Then later tonight, Steve, my little sister, and I are going to see the movie ""Omen"" at midnight. We already got the tickets :c) Woo Hoo!!!!!!

I asked my brother if he would like to move with us, and I can tell that part of him definetly doesn't want to, Which I understand. I wish I would know for sure though, so I could know if I am looking for a 1 bedroom or 2. The only problem is money. I wish things weren't so expensive. Steve got a job at Border Grill..The new one that is opening up in Negaunee. That'll help out a lot. But if you see anything in the paper or something like that, let me know, because it's hard to find a place that will allow pets. 

I'm starting to feel lonely again. Go figure hey?! lol. I'm not talking about Love Lonely. Steve is great. But it's back to the whole friends situation. I guess I go good for a while just being by myself, or just hanging out with Steve and occasionally his friends..But there are times that I really wish that I had at least one person that would call me just to say hi, or see how I am doing.

I mean, I love kids,..I love them to death, But I havnt signed up to be a Mom yet. Three days straight with a little girl that will <u>not</u> listen to a word you say isnt exactly my opinion of a great time. I just get so frustrated. Once I get frustrated because she wont listen, the little things that normally dont bother me too much are just pushing me to the edge...Like right now as we speak..she is in my ear. ""Kimmie, what are you doing...How come you are moving your fingers so fast?...Oooo look at that! Are you winning?!"" I find myself becoming really sarcastic with her when she asks those kinds of questions...I feel bad after I say them, but at the moment it feels good. Like..I opened the fridge and she says ""Hey...Is it cold in there?!"" and I said ""No Wren, It's really hot, and you better be careful cuz you might burn yourself!!!"" so then she'd be all worried about going into the fridge. I explained to her that I was just teasing afterwards, but ugh! She KNOWS the fridge is cold! She knows it!!! Oh, and I was on the phone with my Mom, and I said ""Hey, Is Becca home yet?"" and Wren is standing right along side of me, with her fingers to her ear and mouth pretending like she is on the phone and she says EXACTLY what I said and was standing exactly the way I was standing! Okay, at first, it was cute, and I smiled at it, but by the end of my telephone conversation I wanted to Strangle her!!! Word for FREAKING word!!!!!! She was on a mission to annoy and she definetly accomplished it. But whatever...I go back to work tomorrow...and she goes back home tomorrow. 

I was thinking about taking one of those survey things out of Andrea, or Kristen's Journal, but everytime I do that, I get maybe one or two posts..then I look at everyone else's who gets 4-10 posts, and I get sad.

Steve and I are doing <u>great</u> :c) I love him <u>so</u> much, despite what people tell me I should feel! I am totally over those people and their comments. We celebrated our Official 3 year mark at the beginning of this month. We have technically been together for longer than that, but didnt start being offical till April 1st. lol. Our puppy, Dozer, is ADORABLE! I would post a picture but I dont know the link for that anymore. 

I get my new car tomorrow morning. Well Okay, it's a used car, but it is new to me! It's a '98 Plymouth Breeze. Look it up on Google Images, It's cute! lol. I cant wait to get it, but I <u>can</u> wait to start the loan payments. *icka*

So it sucks because I never really get a chance to get on the computer and actually be able to STAY on for a while to talk to people. Needless to say, I dont hear from people very often. Sometimes I think that maybe if I had the chance to get on, people would talk to me more....but then again I guess I can't really expect too much. 

There are so many different categories of friends. There are aquaintences (the kind of friends who you say Hi to every now and then to see how they are doing and what they are up to) there are social friends (the kind that you go out and hang out with and have fun with whenever the chance comes up) and then there are best friends (the kind that you could spend almost every moment of your day with and never get bored). Now that I think of it, I get really sad because it seems like all of my friends are aquaintences. Not only that but it seems like my family is an aquaintence. 

I've heard the excuse ""But Kim, you live with your boyfriend!"" That is the lamest excuse to use when explaining to me why you dont call, or visit, or anything. I guess if I want to have friends again in my life, I better not get married or anythign crazy like that. I mean, come on, who calls couples who live together! 

But whatever, I guess I'm giong to have to suck it up and deal with it sooner or later. Might as well be now, cuz I for one am tired of getting my feelings hurt.

Sooo Anyway.. I figured some people out there might want to know what's been giong on with me..so there you go. I guess I will let you all go. Dozer has to go out, and then Steve and I will prolly go hit the hey cuz we got a big day tomorrow :c)"

People always tell me that you wont find love until you learn to love yourself...or some crazy version of that. How do you just pick up after 19 years of hating yourself and try to have different feelings? It's bloody hard, let me tell you! I am kind of scared that if I do end up accomplishing this goal..that in the process I will become some bitch taht is so full of herself that she just leaves everyone in the dust. I would rather go through my life trying to make other people happy rather than make myself happy first, even if it means putting others to the side. I hate the thought of that. And I am in no way saying that I am this awesome person that spends her time making everyone's lives better, because I know that I am not a great person, and that I have hurt people in the past. I am just confused right now and kind of stuck in a rut and I dont know what way I need to turn in order to get out. You know, When I was taking my Social Work class with Carol Simpson...she really hit me hard with something. She was talking about the type of personality that people walk into her class with. She said that we were probably all people who just want to help others, and who will sit and listen for hours if we thought it would help a friend in any way. She stressed to us that if we were those kind of people, that we were in the right place, but she also told us that if we were carrying extra ""baggage"", that we had to let that go before we could truly help anyone. I don't know how to get rid of my baggage. I don't know how to get past feelings that I have. I don't know how to deal with scars that I can both physically and emotionaly see. How can I just throw these things aside when I have constant reminders? Like, sometimes I look at myself in the mirror and I just feel so ashamed. I feel like I was a mistake. How could someone as awesome as God create something like <u>me</u>. Then there are other, very rare, days where I do my hair all nice, and I try to cover up as much as I can with make-up, and I feel good..especially when people notice, and say something like ""I like your hair!"" or ""You look really pretty today"". I don't know. I guess I just don't know how to change feelings and insticts that I have had since I can remember. 


K. I am going to end the journal with some thoughts. So these will be a few one liners...maybe more depending on who it is directed to. (By the way, There wont be any names used)

I am glad that things are working out with us. I thought it would be a disaster, but it's not, and I'm happy that it isnt. And I am sorry for saying and doing the thigns I did. 
__________

Thank you for befriending me, even when you didn't know me. And thank you for including me into plans. It made me feel wanted when that feeling was a rare.
__________

Please...Do me a favor, and get over yourself. Not everything you say is right, and not every opinion you have is dominate. I miss the old you.
__________

You were there for me when I needed you, and I tried to be there for you just as much. When substances came between us it made me really sad. It felt like I had lost someone that ment a lot to me. I am still trying to hold on, but you make it so hard with the way you respond. Just know that if it fails...I tried to do my part...I don't know what else to do. 
__________

Things between us will be fixed and back to normal. I can feel it right now. It might take a while, but neither of us will let such an awesome friendship die down. I love you. lol, but not in a girl on girl way :c)
__________



Well that's good enough I guess. I don't even think some of those people read my journal entries...but oh well. I'm sure I'll tell them to their faces sooner or later. 

I hope you all got some kind of enjoyment. I'm going to go somewhere where my fingers dont feel like they are about to fall off! Later"

I hate how no matter what I do, people think I am making the biggest mistake of my life. Key word...MY. 

I really hate having to come to the conclusion that there wont be people there for me when I need them. I always thought that I would have someone....

Not many people talk to me that much anymore...except for the girls from work. I love those girls. So most people dont really know what's going on with me....I guess I'm trying to think more positively on life. I dont really have very much right now. I dont have people to talk to or hang out with...I love living with Steve....when we arnt fighting. My hours are cut so not as much pay, and I'm pretty much bored all day long, But I know that if I just keep my head up and just let everything pass me by...just let all the shit go...that something good will happen. Something good has to happen. 

I have had the thought of moving to Wisconson and going to a two year college in my head for a while. I'm hoping to bring Stephen Jay with me. We can have a fresh start. Meet new people. etc. I gave up pop and I'm trying to eat healthy....when I get a chance to get food...

"event","Sooooo I guess I'm living at Steve's house right now. I know a lot of people are mad at me for it. And I know a lot of people think that I am messing up my life. But a lot of people dont understand what goes on in my head and what I feel. I hate hearing someone say ""You know...they were all talking about it and...""  or  ""I was talking to them about it and..."". No one bothers going to the source anymore. No one bothers coming up to me and talking about it. But whatever. Not much I can do about it anyway. 


I've been trying to get a hold of Josh lately to see if maybe we could hang out, but that seems to be a bit of a dead end. They are cutting everyone's hours at Wal-Mart for the months of January and February. For me it wont be too bad because other than paying off the last month's utilites and stuff, I'm done...which is good. I'm trying to get a second job in Ishpeming too, that way I can get more money, and be closer to home I guess. But like I said...as of right now I have a lot more time on my hands than normal. It's weird because I dont know what to do with it. I dont really have much to do. It's hard to unpack at Steve's house because I dont have enough room to keep everything...so I need to go through my boxes....but I dont know where anything is in my boxes because...well that's another story that I dont need to get into. It's just frustrating because in order to figure out what I'm keeping and what I'm getting rid of, I need room to unpack everything and see what can fit...blah blah blah.....I'm sure this is really interesting to all of you...


So I wrote down the names of a bunch of books that I want to read. I have to get a credit card first though so I can order them for cheap off line. I guess it'll be a while before I can read them. lol. oh well. 


So Christmas was alright I guess. It makes me sad because I remember Christmas when I was little and it was this huge deal and everyone was always so excited, and slowly it started to fade. The excitment was gone for the most part. I dotn know. I guess it's just kind of disheartening. The girls had a christmas party type thing at the Longyear house...I went there for that. It was nice to see them again.....


I got a $30 gift certificate for Michales and I am REALLY excited about that. I am going there tomorrow to get some paint,..because I also got a couple of blank canvases :c) 


Steve doesn't have a working computer at his house so I come by my parents every couple of days to check my mail and livejournal and what-not.....so if you need to get a hold of me, your best bet is to call me there....I hope I get at least a couple calls.


I guess I'll let you all go now....I hope you all enjoyed your Christmas and New Years..."

"event","I have been asked by someone to live with them for a couple weeks just to try it out, for a possibility for next year. I am thinking about it. I don't want to throw any options out the window...but I am thinking about it. 


I am also thinking about doing something that I know will upset a lot of people. That is all I seem to do for a few of people these days, but I figured that I should think about what is best for me, and what I think or know I can handle. If they really care about me then they will understand. How can they tell me what is good for me? They have no idea what is going on in my head and they will never know because they will never be <u> me </u>. 


As of right now, I am tired of not being able to do small things because I am worried about stepping on people's toes. I hate how certain people end up making my decisions for me without even saying anything. It seems like some people think that no matter what comes out of my mouth, I am skeeming against you, or yelling at you, or pissed off at you. I'm tired of it. Do you want me to do a little dance for you? Do you want to be my Puppeteer? Or can I live my life now? Can I be who I am without worrying about who I am making mad?


I miss highschool. I never thought that I would hear myself say that because there are times in highschool that were very tough for me and not many people go through, and no one understood, and still to this day don't understand. But I do miss highschool for a few reasons. School was easy. It wasn't all test taking, it wasn't based on how good you study. I am not a bright person. I have horrible study habits, I can not retain information for the life of me. I suck at college..bottom line. I miss highschool because I felt grown up, but now that I look back...even though it was just a couple years ago, I realize that I didn't have to deal with the things that I am now. As of right now, I feel like I shouldn't have to deal with the things that I am. Rent, Gas Bill, Phone Bill, Electric Bill, Water Bill, Working as much as I possibly can, managing my money to the point where I barely have anything left for myself. These kinds of things were always handled by the ""Grown Up"". I don't know. Maybe I'm just dumb....Another reason I miss highschool is because there were always different people, and different faces. I had many friends and aquaintences. People that I would just stop and say Hi to in the hall. People that I probably will never see again. 


I miss some of the people I used to hang out with. I miss Disco Ball nights with Steve, Crystal, Malia, and Josh. I miss all of us just sitting in my room, talking about whatever came to our minds, while listening to Dashboard Confessionals and watching the disco ball lights dance on my walls. We would seriously just lay there for hours. Some of us would fall asleep, and the rest of us didn't care...we would be quiet, and talk until it was our turn to be tired and fall asleep. Sometimes we wouldn't wake up in time and I'd have to sneek the boys out of my house because it was too late. I miss having heart to hearts with Crystal and Malia. We all really got along. We were there for eachother, and helped eachother in any way that we could...even if it was to just let eachother cry. I miss planning out where we would sit in the theaters...so that I would end up ""accidentally"" sitting next to Steve, and Malia would ""accidentally"" end up sitting next to Josh. Where did the time go? Why did some things have to change? I miss you guys... 


I miss sitting in Mrs. Bolitho's class and never having a frown on my face. I miss my Composition/Speech class and all of the people in it. I miss the closeness that we ended up having by the end of the year. I actually MISS Mr. Stiles class...Now that is amazing. I miss seeing him mouth the words ""Not Cool"" to Andrea and I, while he shooke his head slowly at us in disappointment. I miss Gym class with Mr. Olsen...wait...no I don't. Nevermind. I miss Chemistry with Mrs. Benaglio. Crystal and I would ALWAYS end up sitting next to eachother, even if the seating chart said different. Our physical fights in the middle of class were fun, and so was trying to fit inside of that ball that expands...lol. She let us do anything we wanted. Member that time I was sitting behind you and I pulled your head back by the hair and slapped you on the forehead? That was helarious. :c)


Anyway....I guess I should try to get some sleep. I've been sick ever since the 29th....and I think sleep will help the last of it go away.... 


Goodnight Everyone. I hope people don't get pissed or upset by anything I have said this time...but knowing my luck, it will happen."

"event","Lately I havn't been feeling the greatest. I am constantly feeling sick to my stomach and I dont know if it is because of the things that are going through my head or if I am seriously sick. I was sick for a while..but it is like a lingering pain that refuses to go away. It probably is just me..and my head. I'm probably making myself sick again like I used to when I had things that bothered me. I don't physically get sick from it...like I'm not puking my guts out or anything...I just have a constant stomach pain. I never found a way to get rid of it, then again I suppose I never really tried. I figured ""Hey, it's there. Deal with it"" 

I don't know who all reads this, and I don't know how easily people get offended,... but chances are, if certain people are reading this, they will get mad at me. It seems like lately that's all I am doing though. No matter what happens, I am letting someone down. I hate that feeling more than anyone will ever know. I know that what I should be doing in life is making myself happy and content before I go out of my way for others. That sounded really selfish, but I dont mean it that way. I hope you understand. I know that I don't worry about my feelings as much as I should, and I definetly don't talk about them as much as I guess I'm supposed to...Which I have found pisses people off. I can't help it though. If I am not comfortable with talking about what I am feeling, then I'm not going to. Why would I put myself through even more things that I hate. If I want to talk about it, I will. And I'm not saying that your not allowed to ask me what's wrong or anything, becuase it's nice to know that people care..but don't get upset at me if I am not ready to talk about it. 

The next paragraph isn't intended to make anyone mad. It's not intended to hurt anyone or cause any problems. I just have to get things off my chest I guess. So if you think your going to be upset if there is anything about you in here...don't read it. No names will be mentioned.

I hate that all you ever do to have fun now is drink. Sure...go ahead and drink, you are 21 and you are legally allowed to. I mean..it was even okay to me when you werent 21...but it't not okay that the only way you have fun is when you drink. I know you say you hate having 8 parents, I know you say that you can handle it, I know you say that it's not as bad as it seems...but those are all the things that my friend once told me before he got in way too deep. I'm just worried about you. I care about you...and your going to have to deal with that. I'm here to stay and I want you to be too. 

I am hurt that you got so angry at me for not telling you about Steve and I. It's not like I was trying to hurt your feelings, and you should know that. You should know that I wouldn't do things to hurt you. I knew that your reaction wouldn't be a happy one. I wanted to be able to be happy becuase I got what I wanted and I feel sooo good about it. You mean a lot to me. I have ALWAYS looked up to you. You are good at everything and I have always wanted to amount to just half that you do. I don't like telling you about my failures, because I feel even less. I don't like telling you about things that I know will upset you in some way because whether or not you realize it, you show that you are not happy. I wanted my love high to stay with me. I didn't think it would be that big of a deal that you wouldn't even talk to me about it. 

I hate that sometimes I feel so left out of the group because I am always away. I know that you don't mean it..but sometimes it seems like I am being pushed out in a way. It is probably all just in my head, because that is the way I think and act. I can't help it. I have tried to see it in a better light, but it just fades away. Please don't get angry at me because I feel that way though. It's not really something I can control. I am sorry that I think and feel diffently than you do. 

I hate how you post a new journal entry 8 times a day about bull shit. Just come out and say it! The people from last year suck ass. They are worthless. And next year, you will say the same thing about the people that you ""love"" this year. Fucker.

It sucks that you never call me anymore. I suppose you never really did in the first place..but as soon as you got different friends and started to get into alcohol and weed, I was out of the picture. I still care about you. I still consider you a good friend. I still worry about you and everything that is going on in your life. It'd be nice if you would show up at my doorstep every once and a while. 

I am kind of at a loss with this one. I have never been this close to someone that I barely know. You helped me out so much last year, and I thank you so much for that. You are always willing to help me out if you can. I guess your just busy though? I don't know what to think about it I guess. 

I think that you are the person I am worried about most. I know that we didn't really get along very well at all at first, but now it is different. We have both grown up. We both have had a taste of eachother's lives. I know that you think I havn't been through the thigns that you are going through, and chances are, there are things that you are experiencing that I havn't, but I have been through more than you think. I wish that you would just take some of the things I say to heart, and not just throw them away. When I say that things will get better, I mean it. I'm not just saying that to get out of the conversation. Yes I do not live at the house anymore. NO, that does NOT mean that I don't have time for you and that I have a different life that is seperate from yours. It does NOT mean that I don't care about you anymore. I hate when you say things like that to me. People your age are bitter. They are the worst and treat eachother like shit, but they grow up. Just let things smooth out. I wish that you could be honest with what you tell me. I hate seeing you in a gutter like you are right now. I hate hearing about how much you want to get out of our lives. I love you and that will never change. 

I really hate the the things that you said to me. I hate that you would say those things after everything that we have been through together. I hate that I can't bring myself to talk to you anymore because every time I do, I say to myself ""Why would you say that if you didn't mean it"". It hurt, and I can't seem to get over it I guess.

Don't send me messages through Facebook and bitch at me for having to grow up when I havn't talked to you in I don't even know how long. You have hurt people I care about. I am not a big fan of you. Deal with it. I have never done anything to you in my anger, I have never confronted you about it and started a fight. I hold it in. I avoid you. I havn't done anything wrong. That whole incident made me dislike you even more, so good job. 

Don't be fake. I hate it when you do that. 

I guess this is enough ranting for now. I probably made people mad, because I guess I'm good at that? I am not sure but I am thinking about going away for a couple weeks or so. Not sure if that will go as planned...but I'll keep you all updated. So I guess I'll leave you all now."

"event","Wow, a lot has happend since I last updated. So as most of you know, there are a lot of bumps going on in our house. I wish that everything would just get resolved already, whatever it may take, so all the drama can move out of the house. I'm getting tired of it all. What is the point in staying there if all certain people do is cause stress?! I suck at school as it is, and this isn't helping. 

On a lighter note...things with Steve and I are going really good. We are together again, and I suppose to some of you, that may not be a ""lighter note"" but I am happy about it. I held back on telling people because I wanted to be happy about it, I wanted to have my moment of being excited and hyper and anxious. I knew that if I told some people that are close to me, they would have answered with an ""Oh..."" and maybe even a slight roll of the eyes or something like that. I dont know,...I guess people just dont understand. My little sister was really happy for me, because she can see that I am so much happier when I am with him, and so much more confident. I dunno...thanks for making me feel better Bec :c)

School I think is going downhill. That's not a plus. I don't think I was ment to go to school...grrr to my brain. I just can not concentrate. I can't sit in class and listen to the professor. I dont know why. I just Can. Not. Do it! If I go into class with my laptop, I end up on AIM...so I dont take my computer to classes, unless I need it to take lecture notes cuz the professor talks way too damn fast. So I go into class with just a notebook and paper...and I end up either drawing, or writing anything that comes to my mind. Today I started a short story in math class. What good is that going to do me? Especially when I am not even in an English class this semester! 

I have been a monster on Ares lately. I am downloading ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" episodes. I cant wait to watch them all! I watched one last night with Ginger and Kristen. We laughed the whole time. That show rocks my socks. I'm trying to find some ""Salute Your Shorts"" episodes too, but so far, no luck. Actually...cancel that last comment, I just found a million. lol. I guess I have some requests for Pete and Pete too. I'll have to do that a different day though. 

It is weird going back home. I am going to be spending 3 or 4 days there next week cuz my parents are going out for their anniversary. It is going to be strange. And I'm not going to have a lot of fun getting up and going to school for 9 AM when I am not living in Marquette. grr. lol. 

So the bomb threat at Wal-Mart was kind of freaky. I had JUST punched in at 2, and walked up to the fitting room when the phone call came. I was standing next to the girl that took the call, and she started flailing her arms at me and I kept asking her ""WHAT?!"" and she finally told me to get a manager right away. I started to get one and she decided to do it herself. We had to evacuate the building right away, and people kept shopping! We made two announcments over the intercom and we still had to walk up and down the store yelling at people and telling them to leave their carts behind and to exit the building immediately! Grrr people! So we finally got everyone out, and then if we were scheduled to work, we had to sit outside until the bomb dogs came in from escanaba and did a sweep of the store. We were outside for 5 hours. I didnt have a hoodie, OR jacket. I was so cold! The next day (yesturday) I was so sick. I think it was a mixture of sitting outside in the cold, and going to the pancake house with Ginger. I was puking all day :c(

I guess I should probably go. I'm waiting for Steve to get out of class so we can go back to my house and take a nap till my two oclock class. *yawn* it's our daily ritual! :c)"

I need to clean and organize my room, study for the three exams I have coming up this week (starting tomorrow), clean the house up, catch up on reading, finish my mom's birthday present, start on Steve's present, figure out how I am going to squeeze 15 hours of volunteer work in for my Social Work class, I just dont know!!.....grrrr! I dont know what's wrong with me. I feel like I'm slipping, and I dont like it, but I dont want to do anything about it. 

Whatever. 

I'm gunna find something to do."

Isn't this taking it too far? Having a Breathalyzer installed in your vehicle is a punishment, is it not? So they're proposing punishing the majority--who don't drink and drive--due to the crimes of a few. Makes sense.

"event","So it looks like the RIAA is beginning to crack down on illegal downloading of music. <a href=""http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/43610153"">This article</a> looks at a group of college kids that the RIAA chose to target. I agree that they were probably chosen due to their inability to put up much of a legal battle. And I think it's pretty outrageous to charge them $7.87 per song they downloaded too. 

I'm a big proponent of legal downloading due to the fact that I know what goes into releasing music: time, money, energy, etc. So, I think paying for it is well deserved (this view is with indie labels in mind). 

On the other hand, I really dislike major labels and feel like they make a huge deal out of illegal downloading taking away from their profits, but when you look at it on an album-by-album basis, it's really a drop in the bucket. 

If anyone is interested in legal downloading for cheap, <a href=""http://www.emusic.com/"">emusic</a> is a great resource."

Two, this year they aren't going to announce the sale of wristbands until the day of the actual sale and the first 2000 will only be sold to Austin residents. Sorry, we all can't live in Austin, how 'bout making it Texas residents? Three, SXSW started as a showcase for unsigned/little known bands, but now it's some major label schmooze-fest. It's just sad and lame.

"event","Well, I was gonna writa a post about this documentary I saw last night called <a href=""http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/friends_of_god/"">Friends of God</a> and how evangelical christian groups, like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Cry_Campaign"">this one</a>, piss me off.  

But then I read <a href=""http://www.statesman.com/news/content/region/legislature/stories/01/19/19smoking.html"">this article</a> today about a state-wide smoking ban. I have mixed feelings about this issue. One, I really like the idea of going to a bar and not coming home smelling like shit. Two, I really don't think it will cause a significant loss in business. In this article they state that bars in Austin are loosing on average $5700 per month. This sounds like a lot, but that breaks down to about $190 per day. Drinks in Austin aren't cheap, so let's say that a customer would spend $20 at the bar on any given night, that means the bar only looses around 9 customers a night. I'm sorry, but loosing 9 customers a night ain't gonna do shit to the bottom line. Plus, in business you constantly have to adjust, so if they were really worried about this $5700 they would either raise prices or find a way to drum up more business. Third, I believe everyone has a right not to breathe smokey air. The argument that non-smokers don't have to go to bars can just as easily be used smokers. You don't have to smoke. 


Now, with all of that said, this ban does have a down side to it. Mainly the fact that business owners don't have a say in part of their business. 

Bottom line, this was gonna happen eventually."

The Pogues haven't played the US in 15 years and this will probably be my only chance to see them. So, fuck it, in March I'll be in New York with several of my closest friends. It'll be like when we used to go to Mexico for spring break, except no rat tacos or chicle kids (or maybe there will be?)."

"event","Crawford, Texas (not AP) - A tragic fire this morning destroyed the 
personal library of President George W. Bush. The fire began in the 
presidential bathroom where both of the books were kept. 

Both of his books have been lost. A presidential 
spokesman said the president was devastated, as he had 
almost finished coloring the second one."

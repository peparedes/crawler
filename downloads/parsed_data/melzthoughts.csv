"event","Welcome to senior year! Wow its bittersweet honestly. I mean of course Im excited to be in the ""real world"" but definately sad that this is the last year with some kick ass people. Have I mentioned how much I LOVE my major. What girl wouldn't love sitting in a room with 40 people 5 of whom are girls :) Mmm eye candy...except then Im afraid to talk in class for fear I may sound dumb or my voice will sound all manly or something. Yup senior year and Im still worried about stupid shit like that. 
   So my sister has moved in with me! YAY!! If you know me at all you know that my living situations haven't always been exactly ideal so this is amazing! She makes me dinner and cleans even more than I did before...oh its glorious. 

Yeah well here's to the first week of my senior year! Oh the memories we shall make and keep with us forever! :)"

"event","Today I realized that I constantly let people walk all over me. What I don't understand is that it's only certain people. I am generally a very strong person and have never had a problem saying what's on my mind or standing up for something I believe in or disagree with. In high school I was always the one to tell it like it was but it seems that college has killed that girl in me. Today my roommate, soon to be ex roommate, totally bitched me out for asking him to get his stuff out of here. I have sat here all week and just listened to him blow smoke up my ass saying he was moving his stuff as fast as possible and today I just had enough. I finally had the guts to say something and he bitched me out. Three years ago I thrived on confrontation but today I'm like a little puppy running away with my tail between my legs. 
   It's not just my roommate though. At night I sit and try to figure out what it is that is constantly bothering me. Why am I always so agitated? Have you ever just felt completely unappreciated? Like all your good deeds go unnoticed. I know that ""good deeds"" are just that and they shouldn't be done in the hopes of getting some recognition. But when it comes to helping others out consistently, it would be nice to at least see some type of appreciation. I'm just tired of giving and giving and at the end of the day feeling like nothing will ever be good enough. 
   I'm ready to be the girl I once was. I want so badly to stop trying to please everyone and just worry about making myself happy. God knows I've shed tears upon tears over trying to please and for what? Going to bed feeling as though another day has been wasted trying to make others happy all the while breaking my own spirits? I can't let that keep going. It's definitely time I stop and realize things are never going to change with some people and I need to just get over it and move on. I'll definitely work on making sure I'm happy before worrying about others. Because there is no better satisfaction than being happy yourself. 
   On a happier note so pumped for everyone to come back to Athens to save me from this boring routine! All this time is allowing my mind to take over and it's not pretty!"

"event","Today was probably one of the most worthless days I've ever spent on this planet. However, it did give me a lot of time to think. and by think I mean I thought about how bored I am with my life right now. Maybe I'm just ready for this summer to be over because it has become very routine. Wake up, wait for Matt to wake up so we can work out, come home and eat, then shower and head to the bars or watch a movie. Don't get me wrong this summer has been absolutely amazing. Nina, Kristy and I have reunited and have spent our summer nights drinking and such. Matt and I were finally able to be at peace with each other and actually formed a pretty strong friendship which I'm pleased with. We've done some things this summer that I probably wouldn't have done if I didn't know him. I've met lots of new people and gotten closer with some that I hadn't really talked to before. All in all this has been a great summer. So why am I so bored now?! 
   Today on Oprah, (Oh yeah Oprah!) anyway, today on Oprah that author of ""He's just not that into you"" was on. Yes I am well aware that this was a re=run but I missed it the first time. I felt that I should tune in today since my mom went out and bought the book for my sisters and I, stating as she handed me the book, ""Missy I really think you need to read this"". I remember thinking what the hell does she know...then I opened the book. Let me tell you I think someone told my life's stories to that man and he just put a twist on it and threw it in his book. I probably read this like six months ago or so and for a while when I felt myself starting to have a crush or whatever they're calling it these days I would analyze every freakin thing the guy did. Over anylization is never a good thing. Eventually I stopped ""crushing"" (ha yeah right) anyway and the book was pushed to the back of my mind, until today. As I watched Oprah, I realized that if I believed everything that book said then no guy has ever been THAT into me. This very well may be the case (tear) and although somewhere deep inside I'm sure there's a part of me wondering why, I can't say that I'm terribly upset at the thought. I can, say that it put some things, not necessarily boy issues, into perspective for me. Just in time for the fall! WooHoo! Leave it to Oprah to help  you figure some things out in your life. Well, I guess it wasn't her it was really the author of that book. 
   Anyway, that was probably the one thing about my day most worth being mentioned. Not saying time spent with anyone else or chats with anyone else aren't worth mentioning so no one get all tizzied. yeah probably not a word but it's getting late...or should I say early so I'm not going to be making much sense. 
   Well yeah I don't know what compelled me to write on one of these things. Late at night my thoughts run through my head like crazy and I can never get to sleep so I'm hoping that by typing them and getting them out of my mind, I'll be able to get some sleep. However it being 4:50, I don't know that this is the solution. Well I'm out."

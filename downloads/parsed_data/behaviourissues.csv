"event","ughh.. I saw fuckin Joel tonight at kroger. I seriously just wanted to melt into the floor. the one fuckin night I choose to go out and do at least something (like grocery shopping) I just <i>have</i> to see the one person that I don't want to see me.. me, still hideous from the effects of steroids.  god.. he said he didn't recognize me as he walked by.. I thought he was messing around with me when he walked by without saying anything, nope... he didn't recognize me through the mess I've become.. or maybe it was just that I didn't have pink hair anymore? ugh.. still, I feel like complete shit, unworthy of anything.. shit, so I go home and tell my brother and guess what he says! he says ""eww, he saw you like that???""....... thanks a lot. he's so insensitive. I thought I was getting better, seriously... I thought, ok, I'm off the steroids.. my skin is clearing up.. I'm losing some weight, and my cheeks have gone down.. but I guess not. sometimes I don't know why I bother trying.. I don't know how I'm gonna fuckin survive with this ass hole disease if I can't take my pills.. I guess it's just that it's a hard life to live, with a disease, just because you don't have the luxury of not having to take any pills and it's much easier if you don't have the disease because you don't have to worry about nasty side effects or old men looking up your ass.. or just the whole daily routine of pills pills pills. and now that I'm off my stupid steroids I don't know where the fuck my appetite is and I just wanna fuckin puke at the thought of eating anything. 

there's a point in there, somewhere i'm sure. jesus i am having one hell of a pity party. but sometimes it's a hell of a lot easier just to think about why my life sucks rather than do anything about it. hmmmmmm.. there's exercising tomorrow, but i'm not sure if i want to go... since i have these nasty things on my chin.. might i add that when i saw joel, i totally tried to cover up my chin the whole time. i swear, my face musta been bright red."

"event","My asshole brother is back. I knew it wouldn't last. It was just a fun weekend out for him. a fun way to take advantage of my parents. he had them pick him up tonight in strawberry farms.. controlling jerk, if i were his parent i would tell him to walk the fuck home.. ha.. 

i'm off the steroids now and i have two impetigos on my chin.. they look disgusting.. and i have a sore in my mouth. the doctor said this kind of thing is to be expected when i'm first off steroids. funny thing.. when i first went on steroids i also had impetigo.. now that i'm off i have it too? weird, i guess. 

we have no fuckin food in this house.. no, seriously.. nothing too good to eat.. we had blackeyed peas for dinner with some nasty shit.. i dunno.. i swear to god it looked like black eyed peas mixed with pigs feet or something.. so that wasn't verry appetizing.. i had toast for breakfast, because there's nothing else.. and for lunch i had a few strawberries.. which are impossible for me to eat.. something's wrong with my teeth these days.. they're WAY sensitive.. so everything is way too cold to chew... so for dinner i couldn't even eat what we were having because i was so disgusted by it.. so i tried to fill myself up on a banana.. man.. we REALLY need to go grocery shopping.. before i starve."

"event","<font size=""1"">my brother is the biggest asshole in the world. not to mention selfish. he's been making life hell for my parents and i for so fucking long and now he pulls this shit.. yeah.. 

he ran away. ""back back back"" is written perfectly for him. kinda.. yeah..

<b>back back back in the back of your mind
<i>are you learning an angry language</i></b>
tell me boy boy boy are you tending to your joy
or are you just letting it vanquish?
<b>back back back in the dark of your mind
where the eyes of your demons are gleaming
are you mad mad mad
about the life you never had
even when you are dreaming</b>

who are these old old old people
in these nursing homes
<i>scowling away at nothing</i>
like big rag dolls just cursing at the walls 
and pulling out all of their stuffing
ever day is a door leading back to the core
yes, old age will distill you
and <b>if you're this this this full of bitterness now
some day it will just fill you</b>

when you sit right down in the middle of yourself
you're gonna wanna have a comfortable chair
<b>so renovate your soul before you get too old</b> 
cuz you're gonna be housebound there
when you're old you fold up like an envelope 
and you mail yourself right inside
and <i>there's nowhere to go
except out real slow
are you ready, boy, for that ride?</i>

<i>your arrogance is gaining on you
and so is eternity
you better practice happiness
you better practice humility
you took the air, you took the time
you were fed and you were free
now you'd better put some beauty back
while you got the energy
you'd better put some beauty back, boy
while you got the energy</i>

yes. it's perfect for him. goddamnit.. we're all so frustrated. and his girlfriend is a fucking bitch. i got on his screename just to see if any of his friends were on that he'd be hanging out with.. so i see his girlfriend on and I IM her and the stupid bitch didn't answer me. i'm not just being rude.. she really is a bitch. 

and as if all this wasn't enough, i'm so stressed that i'm getting impetigo back. goddamnit.

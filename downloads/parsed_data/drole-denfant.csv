"event","Finally it feels like my life is back to a sense of normality. So much has gone on that i couln't- and dont know if i ever will- understand. But I feel happy with the way things have turned out. However I still feel a little unsafe and i would like that to go away, I hope it does soon as I really want things to work out for us. I think that getting my life in order will help with my own mental stability. Its stilll a while before i start my course but im planning on doing another one in between. Im dreading christmas as i dont have the money to buy the things that i want for the people that i love- who might i add really deserve the appreieciaton from me.
what to do?
what to do!!
I am really looking foward to this weekend- I know im not the only one who is in dire need of some crazy drunken fun! I hope it works out that way but as per usual im fucken poor again.
I cant wait to see my brother who will be home for christmas this is the longest ever that i havent seen him its been almost a year- too long me thinks, we have alot to catch up on.
I wonder if my life will ever be normal- do i even want my life to be normal? what the fuck is normal???"

"event","what a whinger oh well.
i have a wonderfull boyfriend #@%%!#. im not sure if the fore-mentioned would like to be mentioned so for now i'll hold my peace. I love him intensley and have niggling suspicions that my love for him outweighs his love for me, but im happy and maybe in time his passion will grow? however he has sacrificed much for me- much more than than i have sacrificed for him. hes probably going to think im such a knob for starting this- hehehe- then again he may never know... 
Now my love life is finally wonderfull its only understandable that another area would fall apart- i am having great difficulty finding a job- granted my expectations are high but i feel justified. Im getting old and feel that i should be on my path toward financial security. But im helpless and fear rejection (in both my private and professional lives).
But all in all i feel great today and cant wait for #@$$!# to get home to get myself some love..."

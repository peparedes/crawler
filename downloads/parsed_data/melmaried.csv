"event","ok...i dont like telling people exactly what i did anymore. but i am going to today! beacause the swat trip to lake tahoe was unbelieveable!!!

on sunday we woke up and met at TOHS at 6am....loaded on to our charter bus and took off...we gave our bus drvier like a 60$ tip so we could do whatever we wanted...not even 10 minutes down the road and everyone was taking out their pipes and hot boxing the bus!! it took 10.5 hours to get there. and when we got to Reino,Nevada we found out there was 3,000 kids, 4 hotels, and we were staying in the Holiday Inn which was rented out to just US! i was rooming with dana, gina, and jackie...but that turned out to be bryce, dana, gina, jackie, and elizabeth...
we went to dennys for dinner and then came back and partied all night in mike lords room!

monday-woke up and took the bus to northstar to snowboard....i snowboarded with john taylor and dana the first day- and the lines were extremely long so we didnt get too much in. we went back on the bus to the hotels....starting partying again of course-got dinner- then went to the static lullaby concert- came back early and me and bryce went on an adventure...we wanted beer. the things we do for beer. we walked a few blocks frm the hotel to the gas station, got 8 40s and went on a crazy adventure to sneek into the hotel- so partied again.

tuesday-woke up and went to northstar again, boarded with bryce, mike, ben, royce, jackie, john....so much fun. oh except bryce accidently dropped our bud off the chairlift so we all went down the craziest run ever to try and find it...but no such luck =( AND jackie broke her wrist :( :(
went back to the hotel and partied then went to a pimp and ho party at the golden pheniox.....all the girls were walking around n their bras n underwear...so after like 20 minute me bryce and royce decide we want to leave....but the buses werent coming for 2 hours...so drunken us thought it would be a good idea to walk to the hotel, late at night, in ghetoo reino, when we had no idea how to get bak to the hotel, so we just started walking, it turned out to be rilly far away...o well. we got back and met up with a bunch of people and had a great time!!!

woke up at 6 am to pack and load our stuff on the bus...went to Squaw valley to board, it was such a beautiful place. perfect village, it was amazing. wonderful snow....but most of us only did a little boarding and walked around the village the rest of the day. when it was time to leave- i went to get my snowboard- and it was gone. someone fucking jacked it. i started crying and all that good stuff...left at 5, got home at 4am on thursday.

anyways, the best trip ever--i had so much fun with everyone, and i met some amazing new people!!! and i have never seen so many drunk ass people, and i have never seen so many faded people, and i have never heard so many people talk about getting fucked up....unbelievable.."

"event","Ok Ok Ok, sorry I haven't updated in some time, but I'm tired, so I'll leave you some more completely random comments to partially summarize what's been up...

-I've been to Cincinatti a few times, its niiiiice up there
-I put in 73 miles last week, and got 2 new pairs of spikes
-Reese and I broke up, or started a break, or something, I'm not really sure...mixed feelings there
-One of my professors said that I had a ""rather nice"" bottom
-I think im like 6'3
-MUUUUFF
-Halo 2 is absolutely amazing, as expected.
-Our XC team won conferences, and a freshman, from our team, won the meet by 50 seconds. Regionals this weekend.
-Wport girls made it 3 straight West Region titles, Reese was 4th, but she'll be Alleghany and that dude from Catoctin at states...I'm hoping. GOOD LUCK WILLIAMSPORT, BOOOOOOOO LOCK RAVEN
-I got an entire box full of retro gear from coach E's office today, including some pimped out sweats n junk for my pops, Reese, and some of my homies.
-Ollie, Rhet, and Phil Jordan are venturing to Lafayette University this weekend to visit Young BUCH, I'd Love to be there for that haha.
-Buy Halo 2, as previously mentioned, its tight.
-I saw a Halo 2 video online in which the guy playing nicknamed the energy sword the ""anti-bitch stick""... Hell yes to that.
-I'll be Home on Wednesday, November 24th sometime around 3AM, I'm saying that we should meet at Waffle House around then, any takers?
-about 2 weeks after thanksgiving I'll be home for Christmas/Winter Break for a long time, The spontaneous waffle house idea is just a preview of what's to come, you best believe the Golden Boyz will be saddled up in full force...you know

"event","I've been running a lot the past few days, go figure. We ended up with somewhere between ""10 and 11 EZ miles yesterday"" because Coach apparently misjudged our run out to the golf course, around the course, and back. Today, we ran to the course, ran 3 miles there, then ran back, for a total of about 7, but then we had to run a 5k on the track as a tribute to Molly Dattilo, who has been missing since July 6th. We wore a green ribbon during the race and there were pictures and candles all over the place and a few members of her family gave speeches and even ran in the race. Molly is supposed to be a senior here this year, and she ran Cross Country and track here at EKU. Overall, it was a rather sad event. I really couldn't imagine how terrible it would be for somebody I really cared about to just go missing...that's something that I really hope I never have to experience. Molly's friends and family showed much more strength by speaking about her than I think I ever could. EVERYBODY BE SAFE!!!

I have a Race at home tommorrow, can't wait...Good luck to Reese and the rest of the Dub Port girls and guys and MVAL's tommorrow...KICK SOME ASS CORP!!!...or else >:0!!! I believe its her last run with the cizzast, so next week she'll actually be on a level playing field. As my dad put it ""Everybody else should have to run with a 5 lb. dumbell, then it would be fair""....id actually love to see that.

Much Love to All

"event","AHHHHH, I finally got to go home this weekend for a few days, not that it was the most pleasant experience ever, but it was still great to be home. It seems as though everybody that I thought I knew Really Really well has almost turned into the opposite of what I thought they were. Seeing everybody in their ""new state"" kind of woke me up or something, it's a bit weird.

While I was home I also finally came to the realization that trust is the basis of all interpersonal relationships, whether it be friends, girlfriends, family or whatever. Its crazy how many things I can sit and think of in which there are ""hidden disputes"" among my friends simply because they aren't up front and completely honest with each other. I really shouldn't talk in the 3rd person there, becaus I suppose that I'm included as well.

I'm really happy to have one person who I know I can trust with any matter, at any point in time. One person who I know I can count on to be there, to hold me together through all that is going down. One person who I know won't fall to the pressures of being ""cool"", and that person, without even knowing, just pulled me out of all of that.


On a less serious note, it did suck leaving home, but before I left I managed to run McDonald's food to Reese, which I pretty much forced her to eat after she had eaten lunch about 30 min. before hand. I think the poor girl ate about 6 meals yesterday, one day after she was telling me about her new ""diet"". I think she's trying to drop from 105 to 103 or something lol. Way to go Corp! It turns out that on the only day I'm home to visit the High School, some kid threatens to shoot up the school so I ""wasn't allowed"" to walk around the building and visit everybody, but I managed anyway. Elkins and Stake are still as scary as ever. We gave shook Teller's number so he can prank call him, that should be great.
Now for some complete randomness...

-At the race on Saturday people kept asking me if I though I could win the guys race. But, I'm not so sure I could have won the girls race, that chick was FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAST!!!
-I saw the ""best HS female distnace runner ever""...2:04 is sick
-Am I really Taller?
-Reese could definitely beat me in an eating contest.
-Mike's Jetta is P.I.M.P.
-Too many kids at college have big rims on their cavaliers...geeeeez
-Ryan Martin is the ultimate target for prank phone calls
-I got the recover disc for my computer, so I should get it back very soon, SAWEEEEET
-Reese's feet look ""BIG"" in her Kennedy's
-I once again Have cell phone action...301 491 0659, or you can hit me up in my room...859-622-4721(i think)

I have no classes today, so yeah, I'm bored, that's enough from me...............

Much Love to All and ESPECIALLY YOU!!!

"event","Well, I found out today that I don't have to run this weekend, which means that I'll be coming home sooner than expected. I'll probably be home Thursday night since I have no classes on Friday, but at the lastest, Ill be rolling into dubport Friday afternoon which means I'll get to see my homies race...hell yea baaabaaaaay. One problem though, I'll need somebody to take me to D.C. either monday or tuesday night...any takers???

Today we ran 8 800's, all were supposed to be under 2:15, but i ran my last 3 in 2:16, 2:18, and 2:21. We ran the first one pretty fast though...2:09, and the second one was 2:11. I think if i would've ran a LITTLE bit smarter in the beginning of the workout...i wouldve finished stronger. Oh well, I guess that's the good part about screwing up, you learn something each time...or you should at least. In one of the intervals, I got tangled up w/ Cornelius in about the first 10 meters and fell down, severly skinning up my knees and back in the gravel/mulch. I was bleeding pretty bad for the rest of the workout. It didn't hurt all that bad though until the trainers pretty much hosed me down with hydrogen peroxide...yeah, not fun.

"event","Ok, here's the new journal. I doubt many people, if any, will look at it and/or read, but It's here...so do with it as you like. I just want to post my daily stuff like workouts and other crap. I'm a freshman at EKU where all is well. I do a lot of running and a lot of hanging out with Kenyans. I can't wait to bring them home for Xmas and unleash them on DubPort.

As of now my journal is booooooooooooring looking. But Reese is going to fix it for me later!!! Finally, I've found something she's good for ;). Don't be fake about it Reese!

This morning, I ran 95 minutes with 4 pickups of 5 minutes each. We never ran slower than 6:25 pace. I love how I can just run and ""easy"" workout like that now and not even be phased by it. Last year, Coach O. would've been breaking the Oxygen mask out for me on that one.

This weekend, we might have a meet at Virginia Tech, in which there could be 500-750 runners. Oh how fun that will be. Then, whether I have a meet or not, I get to go hooooooooooome, to see REEEESE and the rest of my Dubport homies. HELL YES TO THAT!!!

Much Love to all...

You graduate from college and your life has new priorities and your job takes up a lot of your life.  And I just totally lost my train of thought.  See that's what happens when you reach my age. Haha.

I could so get worse with this, but I can't...it's just too awful.  I bet they have plastic surgery for shit like that.

Taken out back and held down
Taking that same water to scour
Rub raw every place my hands have been
As if it burned to feel that ghostly touch
Like a solid wind gripping and gliding
Get it off! Get it off!
Tearing out that part of your soul

I never take the pieces back

Susceptible to the pain and fear
Heartache and depression
Joining oyur side as it destroys
Killing my hope for rejoining

"event","Well, it's been awhile.  Done a lot of things since I last posted.  Well maybe not a lot, but you know...
    I won tickets on WCYY to see Paranoid Social Club (they sing ""Wasted"" and ""Two Girls"" and they are from Portland) which was exciting because I had never won anything on the radio before.  So I went to see them with Ad, and it sucked because we had to wait outside for like an hour and a half, the two opening bands sucks a dick and were on for like 2 hours, and then finally when we went up close to the stage to see PSC we were getting beat by 17 year olds moshing.  Craziness.  But the show was great, got to hear a lot of new PSC songs I now have downloaded (""Where the Sun Don't Shine"" is a funny one).
   Went to Tristen's first birthday party.  She's so cute, my little rolie-polie girl.  Seriously this girl, when she falls (and she can fall just sitting people) she doesn't fall, she ROLLS.  She's a round little butterball- I love her.  
   Ran a road race in Skank-ford (sanford) where I came in first in my age group for women, I even beat the guy who came in first in the same age group.  Hehe.  It was a good run.  Having my iPod def. helped though, since I was battling a cold at the time and my breathing was shit.  Anyways I received a sexy little gold medal.  
   I made a new friend at work.  Her name is Morgan, and she has redhead, which to me is funny, not because being a redhead is funny, but because out of the three redhead friends I have had, they have all had their name start with an ""M"".  She's really nice though.  
  On the redhead topic, I got a call from Mary today saying ""Hey I moved to Denver, CO.  I was like that shit is crazy-retarded, but we talked, well she mostly talked and I pretty much just listened, hehe.  But she's cool, and we're cool, which isn't always the story.  But I gotta take what I can get right?
   I talked to Lianne today too, for the first time in forever, and while I don't think she wants to be friends again, she says she doesn't really hate me.  It's sad because when I look through my pictures and I see the ones of her and I when we had an apt. and then lived together senior year in the dorms, and obviously freshman and sophomore year too just being friends I miss her.  It's like what the hell happened?  I know what the fight was about, but was it really worth throwing it all away for.  Is anything?  Well I suppose some things are of course, but is it ever just so hard that you can't get past it together?  Hindsight is always (c'mon finish the phrase people) 20-20!
      I've been sleeping like shit lately.  I have this thing where I wake up like 2-3 times a night to pee.  It sucks.  And then I usually end up snacking in the middle of the night, which is a horrible habit let me tell you.
   Well this week I'll be working only Mon, Tues, and Fri, when I usually have Tuesday off, but I switched with Nancy since she is taking that day off to go see Paul McCartney.  It'll be nice to have an extra day off.  ;)"

I need two girls
If I can't have you
I need two girls
If I can't have you
One that I can love
To have and to hold
One for at the club
One back at the home
I need two girls
If I can't have you

I need a girl that's clean
To bring home to my mom
And one thats got legs that 
Are open and long
One that thinks I'm right 
One knows that I'm wrong
One that always fights
And throws my clothes on the lawn
One that does laundry
And cooks food in the kitchen
One that says she's sorry
And one just doesn't listen
This girl wears make-up
And that girl's plain
This girl is great
But that girl's insane

I need I need
I need two girls 
If I can't have you
I need two girls
If I can't have you
One lives in a house
With a white pickett fence
The other, high heels
And a tight mini dress
I need two girls
If I can't have you

One wants a lady killer
And one's dead
One wants to get all
Up in my head
One minds her business
Cause she's self-employed
One's independent 
One needs help from a boy
One sees potential in a man
When he's broke
The other one's still thinking
That this band is a joke
One hits the road 
Like the second you cum
The other one you wake up
When your breakfast is done

I need I need
I need two girls
If I can't have you
I need two girls
If I can't have you
One that gets jealous 
When I try to be free
One that's with the fellas
Everytime that I leave
I need two girls
If I can't have you

This girl's romantic
But that girl is nasty
This girl's a tramp
But then that girl's so classy
One speaks french
And the language of love
The other's bangin on me
Like an African drum

I need two girls
We have to be done
Cause all these girls add up
To like half of your sum
So if you brake my heart
Or just be havin some fun
I need two girls

I need I need
I need two girls
If I can't have you
I need two girls
If I can't have you

I need two girls
I need two girls
I need two girls
I need two girls

"event","So what is new with me....ummm Dad's back in the psych ward...I just don't know what to say.  He really and truly has become ""a ghost of his former self"" (rules of attraction).  I have completely and utterly removed myself from the situation because if I don't him and I could end up neighbors at good ole St. Mary's Hospital.  I feel selfish, like I really have been a worthless daughter all along.  Pull me back from my depression...anyone...please..just a kind word....Now I have become selfish and pitiful, I guess I can add it to the crazy and manipulative.
   As for love...being inspired by another.  I think when you have told several people that you love them, don't wonder if you ever lied to any of them, you mean it with everyone, the timing was just off for both, or one or the other...""If two people love each other very much, but they just can't seem to get it together, when is enough, enough?""  ""Never"". (""The Mexican"").  I believe that line more than anything.  I have never really walked away from a situation unless I had fallen out of love.  I am willing to work on love...""love is not story book in consistency"" (me).  With every person you love you gain life experience, you gain new ideas, you add new CD's to your collection (""it's just so easy when the whole world fits inside of your arms""), you gain pieces of yourself you never knew existed....you open chapters that never truly close in your heart, even if they are merely regarded with fondness...If someone says ""you're the one"" it's true...at least in a sense...it's just...for some ""you're my second"" has to be.
   Wow that was depressing...on a lighter note...bought the new ""Harry Potter"" today...fuck yes!! And I ran in a road race last Saturday and came in third in my Age Group...go me!!"

  Well that race was pretty sucky.  Pretty sure my time is off by like 30-45 seconds because we were right in the middle of like 100-150 people so even though the gun went off we had to wait a few to get moving and then trying to get out of the crowd and around people sucked.  I got like a 26 something, but it could've been lower even into the 25's had the beginning not sucked.  And my knee started fucking up around the second mile...it killed.  At least I didn't throw up at the end like several people did.

Caeden peed on the couch which we got through easily, and now she's (hopefully) alseep, let's go check...no such luck.  Pray that the dry Pull-Up will ease her into dreamland.

   Blah...got through a week of parent-teachers conferences almost completely unscathed.  The final conference was the one where I had to break to news of ""your child is overly agressive and we just don't know what to do about it"".  When it gets to the point where he is pulling hair and coming out with handfuls it's a problem.  I was so nervous, I had an emergency meeting with my Director to try and strategize a way to tell the parents, ugh and it just went over not the way I wanted.  I have the outward personality of a great Assistant Teacher, but the bossiness of a Lead teacher.  <Sigh>.  On a lighter note, Whitney's conference went smoothly.  I love her.  When she comes in with her little piggies (pigtails for those of you dumb to the world of children-speak), I just want to eat her right up.
    Realized lately how fat I've become since x-c ended.  But I have no motivation to do anything.  The work day just sucks it right out of me.  I ran with Ad today, hopefully this will help me get motivated.  Fuck it, I know I have a messed-up body image...110 lbs is getting too much for me.  I don't know how I handled being 118 my Freshman year of college."

""One dance, one look, one kiss, that's all we get. Just... one shot, to make the difference between happily ever after, and oh? he's just some guy I went to some thing with once."" (stolen and edited)"

"event","Well let's see, gathering my thoughts...that's a tough one since they all seem to be in a rotating jumbled mess lately.
   Fought with my dad starting Friday, which was awesome.  Just him telling me that having sex before marriage is a sin and I can only be forgiven be repenting to God.  And I told him, ""isn't everything a sin?"" and then I told him the only thing that's keeping him from killing himself is the fact that suicide is a sin...I was mean, but for any one who even remotely understands this fucking breakdown going on for me, can remotely see my frustration.  My father has meant more than the world to me my whole life and I have always tried to make him proud...I never smoked, drank moderately, didn't have sex until I was 19, got my first job on my own, made it through college on my own, and then found my first real job on my own.  And then he tells me he's raised me wrong...What the fuck?  I am starting to feel like everything in my life up until this point was a futile attempt at trying to get this man to love me, and after 22 years I finally see it has failed.  He doesn't even tell me he loves me anymore....You will never understand why I do the thing I do unless you see the things I have done.
   I think people see me as crazy and manipulative because it's easier to say than trying to understand at all where I am coming from.  And the same goes for me, I've labeled some people and I'm not too proud of it.
   Tearing myself away from the depression for a moment, well no not really...I saw the movie ""Crash"" last night...if you have not seen it, do so, NOW!  It is so fucking depressing and yet so touching.  Makes me glad I live a sheltered life comparatively...
   Ok really on a much lighter note...Whitney is walking!!!  Fucking 9 months old and walking!!  For those of you who don't understand my joy, the average walking age is 12 months old.  She's so cute and teeny walking around like a little ""robo-baby"" trying to get the whole process down.  Oh my god, can I just take her to school with me??!!??  Alden bit my boob the other day, I was pissed, but more surprised.  Lilly threw tantrums for like an hour on Friday, like seriously running over to the carpeted part of the classroom and throwing herself down on the rug and rolling back and forth while screaming.  She's only 14 months old, this is gonna be a fun teenager.  And then when I tried to be like ""ok, you need a nap"" she kept pinching my side...grrr.  
    It's all over but the crying
    Fade to black I'm sick of trying"

and you dont want to hear about how i am getting on
with all the things that i can get done
the sun is in the sky & i am by my lonesome
so you don't want to hear about my good day?
you have better things to do than to hear me say

god its been a lovely day! everything is going my way
i took out the trash today and i'm on fire...

you dont have the guts to take the truth or consequence
success is in the eye of the beholder
and its looking even better over your cold shoulder

i'm not suggesting you up and line me up for questioning
but jesus think about the bridges you are burning
and i'm betting
that even though you knew it from the start
you'd rather be a bitch than be an ordinary broken heart

so go ahead and talk about your bad day...
i want all the details of the pain and misery
that you are inflicting on the others
i consider them my sisters and i'd like their numbers

god its been a lovely day! everything is going my way
i took up croquet today and i'm on fire

i picked up the pieces of my broken ego
i have finally made my peace as far as you and me go
but i'd love to have you up to see the place
& i'd like to do more than survive i'd like to rub it in your face.....

hey! its been a lovely day! everything is going my way
i had so much fun today and i'm on fire
god it's been a lovely day everything's been going my way
ever since you went away hey i'm on fire.....
i'm on fire...
i'm on fire...
so you dont want to hear about my good day?


Don't talk to me about confidentiality when I am sure that the skeletons in my closet have been aired to the better half of your state, when it's really none of their business.  Besides none of this even involves you...You can't see being friends with me? I didn't realize you were trying...oh, that's right- you weren't. I'm pretty sure I took you off my friends list like over a month ago.  I hadn't even said anything about you in my livejournal for almost 2 months, and what has been said about you to anyone else is merely in conversation, and as far as that goes it's a 2-way street.  If you want to attack me then go right the fuck ahead because the only person your satisfying is yourself and a few nameless others.  I wasn't looking for a fight or to even have to do this, but you always told me to defend myself, like when you were happy of what I did at the bar.  This shit has just dragged on for too long.  Maybe one of my recent journal entries was childish and I apologize to Karen, I really and truly do.  But if you have anything else to say about me, or anyone else does for that matter, then keep it to yourself....I'm out."

This little 12-year old did not want me to pass her...everytime I passed her she would all of a sudden speed up and pass me back, I was like Whoa, killa...I am out of shape so calm down here...haha.  At one point I looked at her as she passed me, with the determined and red look on her face, ""You really don't want me to pass you do you?"" but she didn't even answer me...little wench, haha.  I ran like a 26 something...horrible for my first race.  It was supposedly 3.3 miles, but it felt a little tiny bit short, like more of a 3.1 or so.  It was good times, hopefully I will do some more.  Then maybe I will actually do x-c this fall at school...who knows...:)
  Haven't heard from Mary all well...surprise surprise...not really.  Maybe she really was on the bridge when I burned it.
Now I'm baby-sitting for Miss Whitney and her big brother Bennett.  Been good times...watched some kids movies, played ""let's take turns rolling the dice"" (taught the kid what ""snake eyes"" means) and then argued with Bennett as he told me I should pick up all his toys...(I won).  Now I am praying they don't wake up, or at least Whitney doesn't before Mom and Dad get home...phew.  Long day...

So as midnight hit last night it was time to celebrate Dave's 21st birthday, not that we hadn't been doing so since about 9, but now he couldn't be busted by an RA.  It was crazy, there must've been at least eight different bottles of liquor traveling around the room.  And of course I was drinking my beloved Smirnoff Strawberry Twist vodka....remember that one?  So so sick...so was Sara, Dave's girl.  I heard her puking on the other side of the bathroom, I saw that one coming as her eyes glazed over a little before midnight hit.  Awesome girl though, nice big drunk hugs all around.
Today we're all off to get some Indian food in Northhampton (yummy!)and then go check out ""Sin City"".  So I'll be rolling into Maine uber-late...oh well, only one day of work before I have a whole day off to lay in bed and be completely unproductive.

Went to the gym this afternoon, was only going to be there for like 30 min, but ended up staying almost an hour because there was a ""Garbage"" concert on FUSE, amazing!  She's so hott.  Saw the fat ass girl that wore the exact same dress as her at the Boston show in the crowd, or at least someone else wearing the exact same dress as she wore at the boston show. Ended up doing like 4 miles or so, cuz i walked like 1/2 of it....
  Blah....I've been doing handprints with the babies (it's hard) for Mother's Day presents...sigh....it's worked out pretty well.  Whitney gave me a hassle though, not wanting to open her hands after I put the paint on it.  But they're cute...I've put the handprints on hearts and written ""My hands may be small BUT my heart is big"", then I laminated them.  So, so cute.  
   I finished my May newsletter today, just a few days overdue.  But in it I talked about setting up Parent-Teacher conferences for June...so weird...it's an odd feeling to be in charge of a classroom.  I'm nervous, and I am sure I will look like a jackass, but what can you do?"

  So, as always, even after going to bed at like 3 A.M. I still have found myself awake at this ungodly hour...I am drawn to night people.  I think God is trying to tell me something here.  Fucking crazy night...We hung out in Dave's room for hours...the ""bar"" being open.  Actually took a couple of shots...which we all know Misty never does.  But Dave kept calling me a 12 year old girl when I tried to sip them, so I gave in to the peer pressure.  Watched a ""Garbage"" concert Dave had downloaded...drooled over my favorite foreign redhead...Mary, Mary is still my fave American redhead.  Jokingly suggested porn...Dave pops in ""Debbie Does Dallas"" and yeah...awful.  I think the soundtrack was done by a high school marching band.  And the title is so misleading...Debbie doesn't do Dallas, she does Mr. Greenfeld, some middle-aged hairy creep, and her friends are involved in all of this too...And she's not exactly even in Dallas yet...Oh well.  I don't think porn was ever meant to be analyzed...it's one of the few things in society that is able to be taken at face value.  Although everybody takes everything at face value.  We are all just faces with no emotions, except for the emotions you want us to feel.  
   Well my hungover rant has gone far enough...

"event","So, I've been meaning to put this in here for a few weeks.  My youngest baby, she's like 4 months, Jocelyn, has two older siblings, and the oldest is like 4, and one day he comes in and goes ""Hi, I'm Anakin Skywalker"", so I reply, ""Hi Anakin Skywalker, my name's Princess Leia""  Boy, did he love that.  So now ever since he has called me Princess Leia.  It's great...The imagination is priceless.  Why do the good things die as we age?  I guess it does only in some.

   Who puts a time limit on falling in love?  
   So, yeah ""Napoleon Dynamite"" SUCKED.  Why do people always think shitty moves are good?  Like ""American Beauty""?  And I hate those people that are like, ""oh you just didn't get it that's why you don't like it""...BULLSHIT.  Oh, I got it, I just thought that the director would have done a better job if he had whipped down his pants, and....nevermind.  And yeah, just because I like movies like ""Charlie's Angels"" doesn't mean I'm a moron, it just means I like fast action sequences and chick flicks.  If it makes you feel any better about my intelligence I also loved the movie ""What Dreams May Come"" which was an amazing look at death and the soulmate.
   I'm wearing my soft jeans today, the ones that make me rub my hands all over my legs like the tactile freak I am.

"event","I hate being on top
I hate when you can see every inch of my vulnerable flesh

I hold myself in a certain way
Thinking, thinking
Never feeling the pleasure

  So today's my sister's birthday.  Happy 17th, Katie.  She's pregnant.  I've been the worst sister ever, and I always tried to make up for it with the siblings of the slew of boyfriends I've had.  The only one it ever worked with was Kenny's middle brother, Steven. I've always tried to find a replacement family.  I never could fully deal with the one I have.  Do I have to?  Does it make me a horrible person?  No...yes.  Perhaps.
  I've been coming to accept my high-speed intensity lately, and not in a regrettable manner, in a ""it can be incredible"" manner.  Not everyone in life is meant to ""handle"" me, nor should I want them to, and I don't.  ""I want to get close to you, face to face.  You have such a beautiful face.  I want a lover's entitlement to be closer to it than people in everyday conversations.""-Jane Sexes it Up.  Those quotes like ""Death is a challenge.  It tells us to tell each other right now how much we care about each other""  (or something vaguely like that).  Yes, the chances of someone in your life dying in the next day or the next week or the next year are remote, but what the fuck if they did?  Why be one of those people who says ""God, I never got to say how much they meant to me"" or yada yada yada.  People get too hung up on their own egos and their own ambitions that they forget they are surrounded by billions of others.  And I am getting tired standing up here on my soapbox...
    I think I need to get back into getting up at 5 to go to the gym before work.  I think I'd feel a lot better about myself.  Plus, if I ever am going to run a road race this summer, I'd rather not die half way through it."

I remember thinking
I'll go on forever only knowing
I'll see you again
But I know
The touch of you is so hard to remember
But like that touch I know no other

And for sure we have danced
In the risk of each other
Would like to dance
Around the world with me

I'll be falling all about my own thing
And I know your the heaviest weight
When your not here that's hung
Around my head

And your lips burn wild
Thrown from the face of a child
And in your eyes
The seeing of the greatest few
Do what you will, always
Walk where you like, your steps
Do as you please, I'll back you up

I remember thinking
Sometimes we walk
Sometimes we run away
But I know
No matter how fast we are running
Somehow we keep
Somehow we keep up with each other

I'll be falling all about my own thing
And i know your the heaviest weight
When your not here that's hung
Around my head

And your lips burn wild
Thrown from the face of a child
And in your eyes
The seeing of the greatest few
Do what you will, always
Walk where you like, your steps

   The babies were sweet today, for the most part.  Lilly is loving, hugging me with her little chubby arms.  And Alden giving my kisses that sometimes turn into bites...ouch.  
   My dad was funny today, he called my cell phone from his cell phone, but he was right in the next room, haha.  I was like ""why did you call me?"" and he was like "" oh i just wanted to see how you were doing."" Haha.  This is the dad I miss...<sigh>."

It's rather interesting learning about things I know nothing about from someone willing to explain it in a non-condescending way.  I asked him to teach me how to say some things in Hebrew, which was hard over the phone, but in person it should be easier.  Maybe if I see them written down first.  I've also had the sudden urge to learn Gaelic, or Irish.  Random...haha.  
  I think I might go to Wal-Mart today, I'm not quite sure.  I'm tired...which is surprising since I didn't wake up until 10, late for me I know.  In other news, I am wearing my glasses today, which...ugh...I hate.  But my eyes were on the verge of contact infection...so I had to take them out.
   I talked to Mary-Mary, she's still hanging out with Meg after the bridal shower.  Seriously we talk like everyday...We need to look at apartments here soon, soon, soon.

"event","Phew, I am motherucking exhausted.  Went out with Mary last night to the tiny bar, had so much fun.  Her friends are so nice, her friend Stephanie gave me a huge hug when she saw me.  Definitely nice to feel accepted, since I am generally pretty shy.  Especially since Mary radiates so much confidence and everyone just loves her, it's hard to step out from the shadows.  But it was cool...Had some infamous $1 jell-o shots.  But mostly just danced, it was fun...grabbed Mary's ass a lot.  Got some beer spilled on me, but it was like only several drops so it was ok.  Went with Mary to some guy's place, tried to fit three in a twin bed, kicked one out, so I could cuddle with Mary, haha.  Finally fell asleep at like 4:30, got up at 9:30, rushed home, took a shower, went to meet Ad to close our joint checking account, went to lunch at the Olive Garden.  Te amo, Olive Garden. :)
   So needless to say I am exhausted, I am debating whether to hit up the gym tonight, sleep or being lazy might win over that, but the day is still relatively early.  My thighs have been feeling overly fat lately.  Ugh.  Plus, I am really congested in my lungs for some reason.
   Had an interesting conversation with Ad today about how I always seem to get myself into situations that wind up getting me hurt.  And if the other person doesn't do it, I simply self-destruct it all to oblivion.  What can I say really?  I can keep trying...I am trying, I think I might beat this game this time around.  
 You know you are in love
when you see the world in her eyes,
and her eyes everywhere in the world.

 When you love someone,
all your saved-up wishes start coming out.

"event","I played hooky today...the 3 hour drive back yesterday was just too much for me.  On top of the total lack of sleep.  What an amazing time I had.  I never would've done things that I've done since the start of the year if it weren't for certain things that have happened.  I feel like a newer person everytime I turn around.  A little less shy, a little more adventurous, a lot more exploratory...
   The crepe place was awesome, so good, so so good.  I want to go to France and have them.  I want to walk through the streets of Paris, holding your hand, listening to the words I barely understand float through the air around me.  
  Everyone there was really nice.  I hope I can go up again before the school year is over so that I can really see some more of Gal's friends and get to hang out more.  The campus definitely made Farmington look like the tiniest campus EVER....but being bigger had its advantages, like the fact that the library was actually huge and well-stocked, and that there really was diversity, not just the token students from random different nationalities we have.  Plue, the walks we took around campus were absolutely gorgeous...
   I got a beautiful Earth Day card from Dave's mom, which I thought was sweet.  Such a wonderful person she is.  Too bad people like her are in the minority.
   In other news....I don't know why people just stop talking to each other.  It's almost sad...you never know when people are going to die...is the anger/hurt/irritation you feel at this moment worth exiling them from your life?  What if I were to be hit by a car tomorrow and die?  Would you rather tell God you are sorry for being mean to me, and that you wish you could tell me all the things you never got to say?  Or would you rather just stop being a little bitch and let go of the bad and realize the only one who ever cared about you without any hidden agenda can be one of the best in your life?  And for those of you who think this is specifically about you, it is and it isn't.  Remember I have seen a lot of people walk away from me...and everyday I wake up thinking, for a brief moment, who will I not get to say good bye to today, or who will not get to say good bye to me?  It's morbid in a way, but it's also realistic."

"event","Fucking a-mazing time....I hate to leave:(

showers pounding out a new beat 
I trade my old shoes for new feet 
I grab a new seat 
I don't like the one I got the fabric's wearing through 
and it's wearing me out 
you're wearing me down 
watching old baseball games and low budget telethons 
ain't like watching you yourself when you yourself is on 
got time to wander to waste and to whine 
but when it comes to you 
it seems like I just can't find the time 
so watch your head and then watch the ground 
it's a silly time to learn to swim when you start to drown 
it's a silly time to learn to swim on the way down 
if I gave you my number would it still be the same 
if I saved you from drowning promise me you'll 
never go away 
promise me you'll always stay 
closed down the last local zoo 
I'm gonna win the endless war 
over who kills the last koala bear 
and who in death will love him more and I 
he grabs me by the hand 
drags me to the shore and says 
maybe you don't love me 
but you'll grow to love me even more 
and I well I'm not surprised"

"event","Been a long-ass day.  The babies were good..Spencer is back into doing crying fits.  His mom even brought him in this morning saying he was going to be ""high-maintenance"".  And man was he ever...Lilly was good though...she is getting very attached to me, giving me hugs and kisses now.  She is so cute, she has this little favorite pink teddy bear and she puts it in the swing and tries to buckle him in (odd how it's a him and it's pink), and she is always taking the other babies' blankets to cover him up in.  It's so fucking adorable...haha.  Then Alden bit me...TWICE.  Little fucker...once on the cheek and then once on the shoulder, but luckily the shoulder one he only got my shirt.  Then he actually bit Specner, but it wasn't hard and Spencer just smiled.
   I got my pics of the concert developed...The ones of me and Mary and the two guys came out, but the ones of Shirley did not.  So sad, so, so sad.  There was a great picture of Mary in front of Krispy Kremes display.:)Haha.  I am a Krispy Kremes virgin, but I will have one soon enough I am sure.
  Definitely have a new favorite Garbage song off the new album (""Queer"" will always be my ultimate fave of all time).  It's called ""Sex is not the Enemy"".  Fucking amazing, I listened to it at least 20 times today, and I still have a ten minute ride home after I leave my Dad's, so that's like 3 more times. Haha.  Maybe I should get a grip...haha.  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  The lyrics are amazing, look them up, I am too lazy to post them.  Although my favorite line is the subject of this journal entry...haha.
   I heard back from the nanny place I applied to yesterday, and they said they would try to find me a placement for this fall.  Fucking awesome, and now Mary wants to nanny too, so that'd be sweet.  I am still waiting to hear from CCSU.  Plus, I found a pretty decent apartment for us to check out in New Britain, which is where CCSU is located, so that'd be nice.
  I like randomness...you know what I mean, hehe.
  Well that's all folks...""as I fade back into the crowd""."

"event","Fucking concert was a-mazing.  Minus the tall, and fat, people blocking my view.  Shirley was so hot, her red hair was just shining in the lights, and she started with my fave song...""Queer"".  Mary is so awesome for going with me.  We got lost trying to find The Avalon, but it was an adventure.  We finally found it, and God I just...I can't get over the way I could feel the bass throbbing in my collarbone.  We had these two guys standing behind us that I asked to take Mary and I's' picture, and then I ended up asking the taller of the two to take some pictures of Shirley and such since he could get a better angle than I.  We ended up dancing, it was incredible, my pigtails rocking out...Then after the show we talked to the two guys outside and actually ended up walking around Boston with them for a couple hours, got smoothies, talked about the most random and incredible things.  Didn't think about anyone but us four...It was the best.  Many a Krispy Kreme sightings....
  The opening band was great...The Dead 60's.  4 cute guys in polo shirts, rocking it...fucking a-mazing.
 Shirley....<sigh>, so nice.
 
 I can't wait to see the pictures...prob going back in three weeks for Dave's birthday....fucking hilarious.  Gal  has great hair, but I think I told him that.  Dave's from London and Gal is orginally from Israel, and both are going to UMASS-Amherst....funny boys."

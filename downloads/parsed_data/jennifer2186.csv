"event","So yesterday I was outside for a long time, and my face was bright red, but now it's fine! I'm going to the mall soon because 5-7-9 is having a big sale and I wanna get there before it's over:) Also my friend leaves for Minnesota soon and this'll be my last chance to hang out with her for a while. Tomorrow I'm going to my grandparent's house because it's my grandpas birthday! Soooo um yes. And on Tuesday I'm going to Java Jazz to see DV8, Subject 2 Change, B-Team Starter, Rocket Queen, and lots more! It'll be mucho fun.

"event","Finally I have time to update this thing. Anyways, on Saturday I saw the Notebook for the second time and it was almost just as awesome as the first. Ryan Gosling = sex. On Sunday I took my little brother to the Space Center. He loved it! On Monday I went to Galveston for a little bit, then today I went to the Mall, took my brother to the park, went out to dinner with my dad, then came home and watched the allstar game which I am SO sad to day the National League lost:( Ooooh well maybe next year! Tomorrow I'm going to the Dentist (I need my wisdom teeth pulled)and laying out by my pool for a long while. Something else is happening tomorrow but I can't think of it. Saturday I'm going to a show at Javajazz!

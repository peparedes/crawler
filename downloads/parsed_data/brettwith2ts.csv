"event","ahhhhh yes! i'm finally updating, i bet you all thought i was dead or something. but no, i hate to disappoint. well if you remember right the last update mentioned that i would start having saturdays off. well yeah, the boss decided to change that two days later, the prick! so no visiting the ville. at least not till after the break. i am getting ready to move into my place this weekend. i'm nervous but also excited at the same time. i've found that it's alot more expensive to move than i had planned. to get my cable and internet it's going to be like $200. what the hell is that? the douchebag of a guy is just going to come and plug in a couple of cables. gee, sounds like that's worth $200 to me. i bought a new computer, which is kick ass! then i've had to go to walmart and buy furnature, like a computer desk, futon, and tv stand, all for way more than walmart should be charging if they really are rolling back the prices. i put together the tv stand today and i came to the conclusion that people who design those things are way fucked up on drugs. example a, you are supposed to attatch part ff to gg using 3i screws, however the area that you are supposed to screw the screws into is impossible to fit a screwdriver in. am i supposed to use the force or other telekinetic powers to tighten that screw down? lay off the drugs man!"

"event","ok so, it's been over a month since my last posting, i still haven't gotten my lip pierced yet. but it's going to happen sooner rather than later. my hours are finally changing at work. next week i'll be working from 7 to 5 with saturdays off! you hear me SATURDAYS OFF!!!!!!! so that means i'll have more time to visit my buds in maryville and do everything else i used to be able to do with 2 days plus friday night. wait! all i used to do is sleep half the day and then drink all night. well i guess more time for that then!. i've become a total fashion whore. i'm shopping at the buckle. the old brett would have kicked the new brett's ass. but it seems to be working, all the girls i know think i look good now. so i guess it's making it a little easier to meet girls then, which is good, that's what i want. i don't really have too much to say other than i'm looking forward to having more time off to maybe actually get to see everyone again."

"event","good god! when was the last time i was here!? well no much has changed since last time, i'm still at the quarry driving my huge truck all day 6 days a week. i'm making lots of money which is good, and i've been spending it pretty damned fast too. i ordered like 3 bottles of cologne and even spent $178 on 2 pairs of jeans. keep in mind this is me i'm talking about, the old brett would never do a thing like spend $178 on two pairs of jeans. that's unheard of. but no, i had money and decided to see what relatively expensive jeans were like. not too much of a difference. oh and i got some kick ass new shoes. i went to the royals game with my buddy the other night, the first night i had my jeans and wore the pair i liked the best. leave it to me to drip two huge drops of mustard on them as soon as i sit down and take the first bite of my shaboygan sausage. what else has been up? i've had a bday. i'm now 25, old i know. i bought 4 cd's too during my shopping frenzy. i got the new coheed, which i must say isn't as good as the last one. the rereleased second coheed album with vary rare hard to find songs from their very hard to find first album. no second stage turbine blade is not their first album it's the second don't argue. i bought the houston calls cd, which is actually pretty good if you like poppy punkish stuff with nerdy keyboards in it. i think it sounds alot like all american regects, well the singer does anyways. oh and i bought an at the drive in cd with all of there ""essential songs."" whatever, i just wanted one arm scissor. i have decided that i'm going to get my lip pierced, and there is nothing you can do to stop me. that's all for now, until the next time i feel motivated enough to get on here."

on a lighter note, i have a job, i am now a miner in a rock quarry. good to know that my broadcasting experience is getting put to good use, but hey at least it pays a butt load."

"event","so it's been a little while since my last post. what's been happening? lets see, i moved back home to independence. i'm currently unemployed, however i did have an interview today with that rock quarry place. i've filled out applications everywhere. um what else, oh yeah! my phone is shut off because i don't have the money to pay for it. so until i get a paycheck and can pay it there are no drunk dials for brett. however, if you want to get ahold of me just call my house phone, unless it's 3 am, that wouldn't be cool. i have a couple of friends that are trying to hook me up with a girl. which would be alot cooler if i had a job right now."

"event","so it's wednesday again, which means one thing in maryville, mug night. this week i am glad to inform that i do not have a headache and it is also my last mug night so, in turn will proceed to get drunk. but not too drunk because apparantly some of my friends are planning on getting me wasted on thursday and i want to enjoy that, well most of it at least. 
they finally got new computers in the library. i guess the 1987 specials that they had just finally lit something on fire. these computers though, woa! i want to steal one. i think i might try that thursday. ok, probably not but i'd like to have one of these bad boys. they are fast as hell, it took like 15 seconds to log me in and boot up, i mean the 1987 specials took like 2 hours. 
last night i successfully put pretty much all of my music on my mp3 player, it's not as cool as chuck's but it does it's job, albeit in a huge boombox sized way.  
then i finally went to bed at like 5 am this morning and had some really weird dreams about people i hadn't dreamed about in ages, people i forgot i even remembered what they looked like. it kind of weirded me out, if only i could remember what they were about. 
stupid dern keeps trying to call me because she wants to go swimming. she's a pool whore. guess what, it's kind of cool outside and i'm not going swimming so tough. that's all for now folks."

"event","wow! it's been some time since the last post. well i guess the latest news is that my lease runs out at my apartment on the 31st. i put in my 2 weeks at the good ole country club but i don't know if i'll actually make it to that day. it's just turned into one of those things where i wake up and decided if i feel like working today. i may just stick it out for a few more days till and try to get enough tips so i can put it in my gas tank and make it home. my uncle told me that i should apply where he is working, he said he is pulling like 1,000 a week. he said he's working like 80 hours though a week, but who cares i'll work 100 hours a week if i can get $1000 a week, that will pull my ass out of debt real quick. then as soon as i have a little bank i can see about getting a job somewhere along the lines of what i've gone to school for. i don't know. i have a headache, which isn't good because it's mug night and i have to go since it may be my last one. i think i'm going to sell my truck, i don't know what i'm going to get. maybe i should just go to the junk yard and get a car for like $5 and try to get it on pimp my ride. i've always wanted a car with tv's underneath it or on the outside by the wheels. maybe they'll give me a fireplace in it or something. i sure could use any of that stuff in a car."

"event","what's happening with me? well, it seems like i've been opening everyday for the last week. it sucks, i have to open tomorrow at 7 am. i haven't been making any tips, i don't know why, there are a bunch of cheap assed bastards that go there. like take for instance, one day the grills were still closed but i opened them up for these two guys out of the kindness of my heart, and the thought that they might tip me. well anyways i made them their sandwiches and their total came to $4.75, both of them. well not that i am in dire need of $.50 you'd just assume that if you had a quarter left you would just leave it in the tip jar for the guy who just cooked you your meal. cheap bastards, those are the people who i wan't to cut their throats. looking forward to warped tour. omaha's was cancelled, too bad. hopefully i will make enough money to afford it, i don't have to pay rent with this paycheck so that will save some money, however i still owe the bank some money and the school. so that will probably take about half of the check right there. then when you consider that it takes about $40 to fill up my gas tank, there is a chunk there too. then warped tour there goes $28 for tickets, however much i put down to help with parking then however much i spend on stuff out there. there goes all of my check. god this stucks being broke."

"event","sunday night was like my saturday. i didn't have to work the next day so it meant it was time to drink up. my friend jim and i decided that it would be a good night for bloody mary's. i got hammered. his crazy nieghbor from downstairs came up, already drunk and looking to get drunker. he sat down and it wasn't too long before the stories started coming. over the course of the night he wrote down some math formula that he said was the cure for cancer. said he knew hunter s thompson then proceeded to ball when i informed him that hunter was dead. claimed he'd been an english teacher, which is the latest in the list of things that he's claimed to have been. his list includes a music teacher, a tv cooking show host, a hell's angel, a special operative in vietnam, a regular joe in the navy who spent his time on watch up on the deck and teaching himself how to play the harmonica. said his mom was marilyn monroe, said his brother is david crosby (from crosby stills nash and young), said he was david crosby. 
i'm sorry i never drunk dialed anyone that night, i meant to but i couldn't get away from this dude. it was like 5 am before he finally stumbled his way downstairs and i really just wanted to pass out at that point."

"event","last night mikey and i went to the palms. it was a good time. mikey had an intoxicated epiphany (a moment of clarity brought to you by the use of an intoxicating substance, like alcohol) well while he was dancing with lindsey he suddenly became aware of how she was dancing, how alot of girls dance. now think about this for a second, alot of girls do something they call dancing which is basically just dry humping on the dance floor. why do they do this? these girls seem to ""love"" to dance so much. think about it, girls are wearing tight pants and rubbing their ""sensitive"" part on guys legs or what have you. now i am aware of the fact that most girls can get off simply by rubbing this area. hmmmmm. the mystery of why girls like to dance so much makes sense to me now. i've heard some girls say that sometimes when they dance with a dude, the guy thinks that they are going home together. i don't know what would give him this idea since you are basically humping him on the dance floor and getting your jollies off. these girls like to make guys think that dancing is all innocent but i now know the truth. your secret is out. then these girls would like to have you think that they think it's gross to masturbate and that they never masturbate, well sweetheart do you dance? then you masturbate. the equivalent of what you are doing would be for us guys to stand around on the dance floor rubbing our selves. you're not innocent. i know and knowing is half the battle."

"event","damned it! there is something that is of some importance that i keep meaning to write down here but everytime i sit down in front of this computer here at the lovely owens library i forget what it was. so frustrating. on a side note though, i've found a new tv show that pisses me off more than anything in the world, more than poker on sports channels, more than mtv live good charlotte and avril lavigne featuring ashlee simpson. we are talking levels of distaste and anger that has never been seen. it's called my sweet sixteen, it's on mtv of course, i'm not even going to discuss the premise of the show other than say it's about spoiled rich girls planning a goddamned 16th bday party. a 16th bday party!?! one that costs thousands up to a million dollars do do!?!? you know what i did for my 16th bday party? i went fishing for the weekend and i didn't even get a car. hell when i finally did get a car it was probably cheaper than some of the finger food that they serve at these stupid parties. i've also decided that after this summer i'm probably going to enlist in the army. they have a ""job"" that consists of learning to work movie film cameras and all that jazz and since that's really what i want to do (the movie industry) it would get me some pretty good experience and training. the only real hard part will be surviving the 9 weeks of boot camp. but i can handle it. i've heard plenty of stories and am pretty educated on all of it so i know what to expect from the recruiters as well as them telling me anything just to get me to sign up then making me a grunt. i think i'll sign up for a 3 year enlistment, it will take me pretty much 1 and a half years for the proper training then it will get me a year and a half to put it to use and start making somewhat of a film portfolio. i did read that they created a one and a quarter year enlistment but i'm sure they get you in for longer than that. oh well enough with these mindless ramblings."

when i was in st louis i saw a burger king commercial with that scary king guy and darth vader where they just stood there and breathed at eachother, it made me laugh. i don't know why i put that there but i obviously felt it was worth stating. i had to open today which meant i had to be there at 730 am, i am not a morning person at all. tomorrow i have to do the same thing too. i don't look forward to it, but at least i get off early enough to do stuff. oh yeah, i tried scotch for the first time the other night and it was delicious, mix it with some coke or pepsi and oh my! i'm going to go take a nap now."

"event","well this is my first post from a computer located at the lovely bd owens library in maryville. why? you might ask. well today i had to turn in my laptop since i am no longer living on campus. which sucks, but they did let me keep the nerdy laptop bag with northwest written on the front. don't bother asking why on that one because even i don't know. must be that technology fee being put to good use. i went to the stl over the weekend for my friend's wedding. i went out behind the hotel and i think i saw nelly and chingy smoking a fat blunt together. ok i didn't really see them but damned it i looked. the wedding was pretty cool, you know typical wedding, except this was the first wedding that i had to actually be in since i was like 5. but i got all sexified in my tux and did my job, which was to stand there. then came time for the reception. HOT DOG!!! that was a blast! they had a bar with free beer, budweiser to boot, i had two complementary glasses of fine champagne and who knows how many beers. needless to say i became the life of the party, so much so that some people thought i was with the dj, not with in a gay way but with as in working. no i was just in that fun mood. chuck gets an assist for part of the weekend thanks to the cd's he burned me. i also wipped out the infamous air guitar solo. well eventually that night ended and it was bed time. i woke up, earlier than what we all should have considering the night we all had. eventually we got motivated enough to go to the budweiser brewery, but not before stopping at white castle for some delicous slider (slimer) action. after the tour you are only supposed to get 2 small glasses of beer but i managed to get 4 making it that much more awesome. then it was time to return to kc. 6 hours later we were finally back. let me tell you, never make a trip like that with a cranky baby in the back seat and while they are doing lots of road work. but this should cover me for at least a day, since i may not post tomorrow since i start work."

"event","holy jeez it's been a little while for me. i don't know for sure why, i think it's just been that i've been so busy being that it's finals week and i'm a procrastinator so i've been struggling to finish all the assignments that i said i would do later. now it's later and there are just so many of them. i did finish my assignments for reporting II, well mostly, i still need to do some finishing touches on my bonus story that i'm turning in for extra credit. since it's not quite finished and already 11 pages i figure she'll give me at least one more day. i've also had to get tires put on my truck since the ones i had were like 5 years old, or something like that and basically wore out enough that they just started cracking all the way through. you wouldn't figure that such a simple task as getting new tires for a truck would turn into such a fiasco but it did. first off, i would like to thank maryville for being such a janky town that all of it's tire places, including wal-mart supercenter, didn't have the size tires that i needed. let me clarify one thing about this though, my truck has two sizes of tires on it one size for the front and one size for the back, now many places had the front tires but not the back tires, or would take 10 days for them to get the tire. being that i want to go home to at least get my bed so i don't have to sleep on the floor of my appartment, 10 days was not an option. one extremely bright individual from walmart suggested that i allow them to put a different size tire on the back. riiiiiight, like that wouldn't cause a crapload of meyhem on my truck. first it would throw off my speedometer, which comes in handy every now and then, plus i'm sure it would be destructive to parts of my truck that, because they work, i don't know about and i don't want learn about these parts due to them breaking. so yesterday my mom had to buy tires in kc, load them in her car, drive them up to jankyville, follow me to the shell station, have them mount and ballance the tires on my rims, pay another $50 for that and having them take my old tires, and take me out to lunch. that last one really wasn't bad, infact i enjoyed getting a free meal. what i didn't enjoy however was the fact that i had to do all of this on the day that i had the vicious theories final. this is one of those finals that even after you are finished with it, you still are stressed out about it. i've got one final today at 2 then i'm finished. i need to go to wells by noon though and turn in the stories that i have then go to the registrars office or financial aid office and figure out what's up with my summer schedule, a problem that is probably a result of not paying my march bill yet. fun times!"

"event","i think i'm not going to drink anymore. yeah, right i say that every time i wake up with a hangover and usually end up drinking again, if not the next night, the next day. so pretty much all this week i've been drinking, it's just been so nice outside not that that's a valid reason but come on, when you're out in the sun playing basketball or something and your buddy has a cooler full of ice cold beverages, it just seems right. usually i'm somewhat of a rational drunk, except for the few occations where i may tell someone i'll throw them through a wall. but other than that i am usually pretty much in control of myself. not last night. i am hoping it was a dream but i doubt that, i hung out with a friend of my ex-girlfriend, the first ex-girlfriend, the one i was engaged to. so i hung out with him for a while and we talked and had a good time, i think we're chums now. but hanging out with him led me to get to thinking about her and i think, in that moment of blackness where i can't remember much of anything, i might have emailed her. now i thought i had outgrown that awkward period of sending drunken emails, god knows what i told her. if i indeed emailed her. i'm scared that i did because apparantly also in the moment of blackness i drunk dialed mike, left my credit card at the pup, ordered a pizza, got back to my appartment, picked up the pizza somehow, ate some pizza, drunken text messaged some people and proceeded to pass out. i remember none of this, only being like that guy from momento and piecing together what clues i have. like the angry text messages back about being woke up so late and a wierd drunken voicemail from someone, a half eaten pizza in the fridge with my name on it and also the info mikey provided about me and my drunken message last night. (that fucking bitch right on the other side of my wall is talking in her stereotypical loud black girl voice and making my head pound!!!!) ok enough i have to go lay down."

"event","i am writing this for your benefit. so you don't shell out your well earned cash on a shitty movie. here is my advise: DO NOT GO SEE THE RING 2! that movie is by far the most supurbly crappy movie i have ever seen in my life. it wasn't scary at all. during the brief moments that the movie tried to be scary it was all just the same worn out effects from the first one and have been played out in nearly every ""scary"" movie since then. the only new scare tactic was having a car get attacked by very badly computer generated deer. that was pretty much the moment where i decided that the film was officially retardedly bad. maybe it's because i didn't have any sympathy for the lady and her kid. why you ask? because at the end of the first one they didn't have any sympathy for anyone else, they made a copy of the tape and let the next person in line be damned. that and the kid is just the creepiest, unlikeable kid i have ever seen in a movie. what did bring a little smile to my face though was the realization that the little boy was also the inbred goofy kid from the new texas chainsaw massacre that hangs out in that shed or whatever. the make up artist didn't have to work to hard on him. i walked out feeling cheated. all of my friends agreed with me, and i even when with one of my buddies who is the biggest wuss when it comes to scary movies and he didn't get scared once. whoever is responsible for the ring 2 should be required to make nothing but jr. high health class movies for the rest of their lives."

Thompson, one of my heroes, and pretty much sole reason why i took up journalism had died. just saying he was the main reason i took up journalism just isn't enough though, this man influence the way i thought and went about my life. it was early in high school when i stumbled upon HST. Fear and Loathing had just came out in the theaters and seemed like something strange enough that i would like. after the movie i studied up on the man and his work. already being a liberal, i was blown away by his writing style and observations. for the high school newspaper i tried to use the same cut throat honesty about my observations in my columns. often writing about my experiences in certain events, albeit without the abundance of drugs and alcohol. i wish he would have lived long enough to see the new wave of journalists and broadcasters that are going to be unleashed on the professional world soon. i think there is going to be a change in the business, a change he would have appreciated, a change that was partially influenced by him. 

in other news, i watched ""the notebook"" at the suggestion of a friend. it really made me think, still i'm thinking about it. there were some similarities with the story and an event in my life. i'm trying to work things out in my head for that."

well i've got to go get ready for jogging class. the teacher said if it was above 40 we would be outside, well last time it was above 40 we were still inside because stupid girls decided to wear nothing but skimpy shorts and sportsbras and would be too cold to run outside. i don't know why i am complaining about girls wearing skimpy stuff. i do like that, i just hate having to run inside about 33 laps because it's so small. ok well i'm out."

""this is the first time i've truly felt that we have god in the white house."" give me a break, we don't need god in the white house. do you know why? because there are too many people that get mentally retarded by their religion and misinterpret certain parts of the bible. what happened to love and compassion for everyone? i was reading the newspaper today and someone was asking what would have happened if the agnostics and liberals were around in the days of franklin roosevelt? wtf!? see this is an example of why these people are so idiotic. 1. i don't think i believe that a liberal is something new to this world, also, that there aren't any liberal religious people out there. liberals aren't the devil, they aren't bad, in fact, i think many liberals might be better christians than these radical religious conservatives, i think they embrace the concept of love and compassion as well as tolerance better than the religious right. Why shouldn't there be laws restricting homosexuality? because right or wrong we aren't divine, the only person that should judge them is god, so why persecute them while they are alive? as far as obscenity, wake up america! the rest of the world laughs at us because of how we reacted to nipplepalooza at the superbowl last year. IT WAS A GOD DAMNED NIPPLE!!! i'm sorry but if you can't explain what a nipple is and that it must have been an accident, then your kids are probably going to be way more fucked up than they should be. guess what? in europe, this includes italy which is home to the pope, they have nudity on television commercials, magazines (that aren't adult themed), regular tv programing, hell they have nude beaches. why because it's the damned human body. there is nothing to be afraid of about it. sex is a natural part of being a human. they talk about the issue with their kids over there and guess what? it's not an issue. we are reverting back to the times of leave it to beaver. 2. act like you know what agnostic means. it doesn't mean atheism. people that are truly agnostic do believe that there is a god above, whether that god is buddhist, muslim, jewish, or christian, it doesn't matter. it's the same god. most agnostics believe this, they just don't believe in organized religion. it's too easy to cloud and add too many individual beliefs into a certain religious teachings. this is no knock against all religion and those that belong to organized religion and are what psychologists call ""sane"" or ""mentally stable.""  it's more of just wake up and look at the true meaning of your religion. it isn't about judging others and intolerance. it certainly isn't about hating others because they have different beliefs. (even though you would never say you hate someone, even though that's what it is) and if i get a bunch of posts from religious radicals that lead me to believe that they didn't really read anything that i wrote, then i will throw them through a wall! but with love."

not much happened within the past week. pretty much the same thing as every week. went to class, went home, drank, came back to school. whoopideedoo. the only thing really that was different or had any significance was that i found out that the editor for the buzz, the northwest missourians online entertainment section, wasn't returning next semester so the position is open. now it's been speculated that should the editor not return, i would probably be the one to take over. i just haven't decided yet. the deadline for turning in applications is tomorrow so i guess i should probably get going on my decision. today i think i am skipping all of my classes like the slacker that i am, maybe putting me in a position of leadership would make me more responsible. maybe getting the position would open the door for me to get an awesome job at like the pitch back home then eventually to an awesome magazine like rollingstone, spin, alternative press, (not that rollingstone is necessarily cool anymore but damned it! i would make it cool again! because remember, without me it's just aweso!"

Anyways, I had a good Thanksgiving break, once I finally got over the flu that I had been fighting for the week before the break. I got drunk a few times and saw a good friend who's been in Cali for the last few years. Anyways he brought some stuff that snoop dogs sings about and dr. dre named 2 albums about. It was pretty nice. I hadn't done that stuff in a long time. then saturday i met up with mikey, his brother and his brothers girlfriend for a night out at the 75th street brewry. they have the most delicious beer that i have ever tasted, and only $2.50 for a pint! that's a deal. Anyways some drunkeness was had by all. we were leaving the brewry jamming out to old pearl jam, everyone was singing loud and badly and not paying attention to the road, including james' girlfriend who was our driver. anyways she ran over a sign and it was awesome. then we pulled into a gas station where there was a broken down krispy kreame truck and somehow james was able to score free doughnuts from the driver. it was sweet, literally. we made it back to james' appartment where we took part in some drunken wrestling that all started because of a random ball punch. finally at about 330 mikey and i tried to drunk dial people, i think it was just my friend renze, dave, and we really tried to get ahold of chuck with no luck, instead we dialed like 3 random numbers before i got angry and passed out. 
last night i was supposed to do my huge project that i didn't do over break. instead i typed out 5 pages that aren't for anyclass. right now it's just a synopsis. of what i don't know. i haven't decided if i'm going to turn it into a movie script or a book. right now its just sort of an autobiography, i haven't decided where i'm going to go with it, what parts i'm going to focus on i don't know i'll decide later. 5 pages all because i got the urge to sit down and write something, preferably songs but in selfreflecting mood i was in something else came out.
anyways enough about that. my roommate brant had to go to anger management today because he called a kid a fag a while back during a verbal conflict he was in with some dude who turned him in for calling him a fag. so then brant was found guilty, fined $200, put on probation and ordered to take anger management. i mean come on. how many people have been in one of those shit talking situations where you don't fight you just mouth off and you call someone something like that. evidently everyone on the faculty and peer staff that handled brants case has lived such pusified sheltered perfect lives that they've never been in a confrentation or ever called someone, including friends a derogotory name they couldn't even relate calling a friend a jackass or a douche just joking around. fucking losers. but anyways after reading chuck's last update i think he should have to go through anger management, killing an innocent phone. the bastard. but since it's almost 2:30 in the morning i'll go to bed."

I was in radio and was going to cohost chuck's show, then I found out the show was going to be on thursday nights from 10-12, how shitty is that. 2. Became pretty much the only music reviewer for the paper, besides my editer. this kept me busy enough that I decided to drop radio-along with the shitty shift. 3. fred lamer said that i have a real flare in his advertising class- FRED LAMER SAID I HAVE FLARE!!! this my friends is the 3rd sign of the apocalypse. the third because the 1st was george w getting elected then the 2nd was when two of my friends almost got into a fight-as explained in a prior post. but anyways i was supposed to have an interview the other night with someone from deathcab for cutie. both me and my editor both contacted their management and talked to ""brendan"" to set up the interview. so brendan tells me that all i have to do is show up between 6 and 7 and tell them that i am on the deathcab guest list and i should be marked down for an interview and they will set me up with someone in the band. well i get there and wander in and ask some girl named jackie what i'm supposed to do. she was pretty much clueless and told me to wait till they opened the doors. so i did and then i found out from jackie that i was marked for the guest list but not marked down for an interview, in fact, there was no record of me having talked to brendan about an interview. well this pissed me off very very much. my editor was specific in telling me that he didn't want a concert review, he wanted an interview with the band. this screwed me over, i wasn't able to take pictures but they told me that i could record the whole show on my shitty interview recorder that i had. what the hell was i supposed to do with that????? so i go in and decide to watch a little of the show since i was on the guest list and all. i sat through the shittiest band ever that opened the show for deathcab, except for when they played a nerdy white boy version of ludacris' what's your fantasy. then deathcab came out and i couldn't even enjoy the show because i just kept thinking about not being able to get the interview and my assignment going to shit. so i left like 5 songs into it. i don't know if i was the victem of a dick of a manager or if there was just too many middlemen to handle the information about the interview. i don't want to be pissed at anyone specific because everyone was nice and jackie was just doing her job. oh who am i kidding? damned them all!! then this week i also get to be on the panel, a campus tv show that ""discusses the issues"" i get to wear my george w not my president shirt and go up against the president of the young republicans, who i understand is the type of person that doesn't let you finish what your saying. i told the producer that this might not be a good idea since i told some douche earlier this year that i would throw him through a wall because he wouldn't shut up and listen to me in an arguement. so things could get out of control. but good god i've written alot and i think i'll be venturing off to bed now. good night and have a pleasant tomorrow!"

oh yeah my buddy was telling me this true story about one of his hippy uncles. 
his aunt and uncle live alone in a house. one day his uncle had just jumped into the shower and his aunt was fidgiting with the garbage disposal. so his aunt got paranoid about her hand being in there while she's fixing it so she had his uncle come in and try to fix it. keep in mind his uncle is straight from the shower and they live alone so he's naked as can be. he gets under the sink and is looking around. (mental picture: naked hippy with his head under the kitchen sink and his ass hanging out.) in walked thier brand new cat. now i don't know for sure but cat's have some uncontrolable urge to attack anything that dangles. well being a naked guy there was something dangling and the cat assumed it was an alien invader or something and attacked. the cat sunk it's claws in and bit. my friends uncle screamed and jolted his head up right into the garbage disposal knocking him out cold. when he came too he was naked on his kitchen floor with paramedics trying to bandage himself up and trying not to laugh at him. poor bastard."

"event","sorry to the three people that might actually read my updates, it's been a long time. i can't remember what i might have wrote about last time so i'll just touch on some things, my last day with the paint crew came and went and i'm now spending the rest of my summer sleeping all day then waking up and doing nothing, oh i'm exciting. i went to warped tour last month and it was a blast, i got to see dave, chuck and a few of their friends that i had never met before. i was supposed to meet up with kieth out there but that didn't happen because of my in chuck's words, ""janky assed cell phone."" i've been trying to get my stuff together to get back up to school. it's going to be a blast. i haven't really gotten too many cd's this summer just taking back sunday's new one which is awesome and coheed and cambria. i listened to some new halifax and adelphi and i am looking forward to getting those cd's or just illegally downloading them. also i guess senses fail went over to vagrant records and is releasing their new album on like sept 7 and from what i've heard from it, it's going to be really really good. ALSO i read that the starting line is in the studio recording their new album! but that's it, i'm going to go play red dead revolver.
adios"

"event","so i listened to the new taking back sunday cd on mtv.com the leak. i like it. i don't think it is musically as good as tell all your friends but it's still good. i get paid tomorrow then i will proceed to go to the bank and cash my check then go and buy my warped tour ticket. it's going to be a blast. 
oh and on the paint crew we are in the varsity gym at the high school. they resurfaced the floor before we got there to paint. well on our brake i decided to pick up a basketball and start shooting. i then got yelled at by my boss for bouncing a basketball on a basketball court. the floor was finished and dry and is meant for a basketball to be bounced on it. well i guess maybe not at fort osage. then the athletic director came in and saw that the janitors had broken one of the thin cheap assed plastic signs listing the years the girls soccer team made it to conference district ect. he immediatly tried to blame us then tell us that the sign cost the school $500 give me a god damned break!! if they seriously paid $500 for one of those signs they seriously go ripped off and i was quick to tell the guy that, but he didn't think that was too amusing but i did."

"event","i found out that the first day that i was down there in oklahoma and i got really drunk and sunburnt, i aparantly went and drunkenly wandered through other people's campsites looking for the restroom, even though it was right across from my campsite. i guess someone called the ranger on me but before they could get me, my friends girlfriend's dad came to my restroom to lead me to my destination where i aparantly passed out in the stall. i remember none of this. i think i might need to lay off the alc-y for a few days i think i consumed enough for 3 people on saturday. so now the people in the state of oklahoma that can't handle a drunk guy stumbling through their campsite can rest easily because i'm home now and probably won't be going back till at least next year."

"event","sorry for the lack of posting lately i've been busy. the fourth of july weekend went pretty well. me and my friend jim went to lake eufala or something in oklahoma with his girlfriend's family. i drove my truck down there and to be honest i was pretty suprised to see that i made it all the way to tulsa before i really needed to fill it up again. but we left blue springs at midnight and traveled the 6 hours to our destination through rain and massive electrical storms. but we arrived and at about 9 we decided it was time to start drinking- this being logical because both me and jim had been up since 5:30 am the day before because of work so we hadn't gone to bed yet, thus making it not really morning to us. but you can imagine the drunkenness that ensued after drinking for that long out in the sun swimming and fishing non-stop for like 10 hours. i was nothing but a drunken blister that night it sucked i have the worst sunburn ever because of it and that was just the first day we were there. i did come to the conclusion that armadilos there are like skunks here. being that you never really see one alive, just dead along the side of the road and if you do see one alive you're probably about to hit it. i got new cds that really aren't that new. i got punk goes accoustic, sugarcult-palm trees and powerlines, hawthorne heights-finally!, silverstien, and another year on the streets volume 3-a vagrant compilation."

"event","i have a good true story. i guess last week my best friend jim's girlfriends 16 year old brother went out with this girl he's ""seeing."" well his mom suspected him of being high when he got home and told him to ""come here! give me your hand!"" so he gave her his hand and she proceeded to smell it. well lets just say that she didn't smell the scent of pot on his fingers, she smelt another p word that only girls have. i'm sorry but that may be bad but it's one of the funniest things i've ever heard. the little bastard. i'm working on the high school paint crew which is ok. except that we started the heat schedule and i now have to be at work at 6 am. that blows. you know what also blows? turkeys! last friday i was coming home from work and a damned turkey ran out in front of me and when a 20 lb turkey collides with a 3/4 ton truck going 75 miles an hour the results aren't pretty. the stupid thing busted out my lights and busted the grill on my truck so now i have to shell out $322 to get that all fixed. oh, might i ad that i don't have that kind of money yet. well i'm going to get off of here now. i'm going to go see fed up wednesday right across the highway from me! ROCK!"

"event","today was the first day of work out at the high school for the paint crew. aside from the whole waking up at 5:45 am part, i was looking forward to it. especially because there was a hot punk rock girl thats on the crew too. that excitement was brought to an end when i found out she was going to be a senior in high school this coming year. sucky assed. there are more girls that are kind of hot but one was my sisters roomie last year and she's retarded and a sororiwhore then there is another one that goes to mu but she's a sororiwhore too, as you can tell they stuck together and hardly socialized with everyone else. then there is another one that goes to northwest and supossedly she has a boyfriend but she was getting mighty friendly with a dude that's only going to be a junior next year in high school, what a dumb whore. and the junior dude is one of those know it all types that really knows nothing and is just a douche. i can tell right now i'm going to have some words with him sometime over the summer. then today we were supposed to start painting the varsity gym and of course it took like half the day setting stuff up because know it all would fuck everything up. then as soon as we get everything set up the basketball coach came in and told us that they had a basketball camp in there in like 2 hours. not cool. so we had to take everything down because none of our supervisors looked at a damned schedule to see if the gym happened to be in use. dumb asses. i'm kind of hostile right now."

"event","so, much like chuck mentioned in an earlier post about finding his purpose in life being nba ballers, i have found my purpose in life: fight night 2004. i think i played it for about 14 hours straight today. it is awesome. oh, by the way, without me it's just aweso! HAHA i'm hilarious! sorry. anyways my only problem with the game is that it has roy jones jr listed as being better than guys like sonny liston, joe frazier, mohammad ali and evander holyfield. i think not, if he fought those guys in thier prime they would destroy him. he's good, i'll give him that, but not so much as a heavyweight. oh yeah, i haven't mentioned the royals game the other night! well the game went good because we won and i got a budweiser backpack cooler. then after the game in the parking lot me and my buddy got into a brawl with a couple of other guys. all over someone banging on a portapotty. (not our doing-the banging or starting the fight) but it was a blast! not that i'm one for violence, but i'm sure not one to see my buddy get jumped by a couple of dudes. can you smell the testosterone!?! well with that i'm going to go to bed, i have an important softball game to play tomorrow, if we win the next 2 games we get tshirts!"

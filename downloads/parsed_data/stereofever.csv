"event","ok, so i wake up this morning, walk downstaris, fall down the stairs, and spill my coffee all over me. then i listened to pedro the lion and sunny day realestate for about two hours and swayed. a lot. my pants finally dried.

went to cafe to get coffee (and shoprite to get sleepy things) and walked around the cemetary for a few hours which was real neat but real sad and whatever.

got home, talked to stoogie for a loooong time and cut my finger open on a ping pong ball </3. not doing so well today.

went to jenns then benitos which was crazy. mainly cause lara and jenn are crazy.

then to tuscan. the only place in warwick worth spending mass amounts of time. got my third cup of coffee. didn't spill any of it. <3. watched a few amazing bands, heard a few amazing poems, and stuff. new fave band = dylan, mike, myles, and tall dude. anyone know the name? do tell.

lara pees a lot.

stopped by adj's for a while, which was amazing casue i see her about once every six months. amy was there too. and jordan who's real neat. and the dip was wonderful <3.

boarding tomarrow with stoogie. first time going to creek with him this season?? woah. that should not be legal."

"event","wahoo! first snowday. that was nice. reallly didn't wanna get out of bed this morning. so i woke up around 10 and went bowling with nora lara scoot and schtoogie. it was preatty neat. i still hate bowling shoes. then we had pizza and shoprite and i hung out with schtoogie and whatnot.

"event","Alright, so <red>Anterrabae</red> is my new fave band. for the time being. i love their lyrics more that their music, but both are most excelent. 

i finally used my early leave today and went boarding. i'll probally do that every ""d"" day now. those are always boring in lunch anyway. yeah. back to snowboarding. it was neat. the snow sucked, but there were no lines so it was all good. and i finalyl got to check out the north park, although i didnt go in because i was broke, and apparently i need to buy a five dollar pass to use the park. whatevaaaaa. 

for all who were concerned, i've talked to tom and his sholder blade has not eaten him yet. keyword : yet. nah, but he's doing ok. he's still out for a month though. </3.

on to better news. i don't think i have any. at all. not in an emo way, just in the way that i've got absolutely nothing else good to report.

on that note, so long and thanks for all the shoes.

"event","<redtext>Heyy. I haven't updated this thing in forever. I completely forgot about it untill I was Bobby's yesterday. So how's it going? I don't think anything important has happened since June. Well a few things. Summer started. Got a job. Worked a lot. The Dispatch broke up </3. I went to camp. Got another job. School started. One job ended, quit the other one. Went to Mass. Saw a bunch of shows. Got second job back. Creek opened. Winter break. Went to New Hampshire. School started again. That's all. Yeah....

Anyway. I think I'll start updating this thingy more often. But its winter, and snowboarding is taking up my life. I get out of school at 12 tomarrow to go to the mountain. Wahoo!

""erm i forget why"" ""was it about the fact that were going to his house tonight?"" ""what no... we are?"" yeah. so i go to scotts. and get greated by three kids and water guns. scott and two three years old recruits. I'm wet. very wet. and i wore a white shirt. smart of me... but thankfully i borrowed a black one. hehe ph34r. yeah.... but the shirts huge on me so ill give it back </3. anyyyway. so they spent wayyyy too much time trying to get me into the pool. then i stole scotts cds and he couldnt get them or throw me in the pool with them so i was safe. my the way im thinking of getting a ligit blog a la tripod. back to scotts. they decided to drench me anyway. with every form of water they could find. but they did not get me into the pool! well sorta. i half went in the hot tub later. but that was different and volentary. so (by the way this entary is in no logical order.) i was running down the road (or couple roads) with no shoes on being chassed by a boy with a large bucket of water. then i steped on a large rock with my heel. its swolen and bruised and i dont think ill be able to walk toamorw. and jon like killed himself by running next to the pool, falling, and quite possably smashing a calcium deposite and cutting up his leg prtty bad. he wasammusing watching him walk up and down the staris after that. he looked sco'ish. the country, not the boy. i know for a fact im forgeting main hilarious things that heppened. jonscoot... hit up the comment button. speaking of coments lara where are you? im not feeling creative today. sorry for not exactly doing this justice. oh oh oh and bonnie is getting a mega hot car over the weekend. and there was this knife... you should have seen it. it had three knifes that poped out of the sides. and it looked like a chineese star only wit three points and knives on each end. and it folded into a cute little circle. <3. and mario donkey kong?? what?? i think thats awesome. turing out to be a pretty good week in terms of surprises. like the fact that no one told me screaching weasel got back together <3 <3. that was the best news ever. i really wanna go to one of their shows. hmm i think im gonna go write to scotts dads boss. in order to get him off from work. so he can take us to the show. woot. catch 22, big d and the kids table, reel big fish, rx bandits, and lucky boys confussion. moi, jon, scott, et nora. this shall be amazing. i cant wait. but i gotta see if scotts dad got off of work. :::the suspense::: but it hink he might have. i think he should just call in sick anyway. whatevaaa. ok im out. i got a stomach ache. and i wanna talk to val...

"event","hey guys! well... i shall write about yesterday. friday. fridays are always good. especially when they involve pimp hats and teacups. 

so i get home and realise noones gonig to rockapalosa. including me. long story there. so i get on my bike and meet jon at the triangle. apparently people with cars dont like me. between the guy who gave me the finger and chris yelling something alog the lines of ""your fucking queer"" out of the window of his tic tac, i came to this conclusion. so we get to the triangle and jon brought the map we needed to bury. once i figure out how to upload pics with html ill put it here. if you know please tell me. sooooo then we realise that neither of ys were smart enough to bring a shovel. large sticks and peices of slate work. right? so out hole was just big enough to slide our map in its duct tape case into. then we cover it in peables. and rocks. and bigger rocks. and a frickin bolder to top it off.

so then we get back on out bikes and go to jons house for a while. and his brothers were eating the worlds best cerial. whats the name? so then we watched vidios including arts of hte stoned cam i havent seen in 98434058305830485 years.

then scott picks us up and were off to the bazzarr. and we're early. so they decide to steal my bag and climb a very big tree with it. i got it back. so we see a sign and cant think of anything to rearange the letters into quick enough so we leave the sign. later someone wrote nude bar. next was 63 tits.

finially it opens. so we go on a few rides, but some funnel cake. we went of the teacups. and jons strong. and we flew. and all got really dizzy and got really bad headaches. and then got off and found out what it was like to be high. only with much more headaches.

then we hit up the booths. and i got a pimp hat!!! and it was grande. and large and green. its awesome. im never gonna take it off. and we really wanted this carnies hat and after rounds of water guns he decided to give us the hat as a prize. scott got it. so me and scott were pimps.

by the way to you guys... <b>i got my wallet back! with the money intact!</b>

today sucked ass. tomaorw will two. i hate family.

"event","heyy! so i supose i should put the events of the last day and a half in order. how about that? Ok. so. last night i went to dyls and that was neat. even though i didnt brign a bathingsuit and had to borrow one and yeah. so we swam and ate and talked. a lot. and amde a fire. or at least attempted to. it was a pathetic fire. but apparently a hot pathetic fire. Peirce and Julian and me and Dyl were there. and of corse we come up with the great idea of burning duct tape. it looks neat and it drips little duct tape drips. but they're really hot. and i was burning a strand and it burnt really close to my hand so i went to let it go and realsied it was stuck to my finger and i burnt my finger and now its swolen and a odd shade of green-gray-red-purple. sorta nasty but its pretty around the outsides. then i went home and found my earings <3 i was so happy becasue i lost them. and then they came back. and it was grand.

so then today i wake up and go to town because i promased the bandies id go to the parade. so i went and read for a while and then peirce scared the living crap out of me. so i hung out with him and janson for a while untill the parade came which was at 11 even though it said it would start at 10 and id been there since 9 45. fun. so we watch it and they leave. and i ride around town for a really long time then go back and read. then go to cafe a la mode to get a mochachino shake. even though its really cold. so i go to kara house to get pants becasue im doing this all in boxers and its not warm. then we hang out for a little while and i go ride for quite a bit more and fianlly chase the parade and catch up with them at memorial at which time a man speaks and some guys shoot guns and some pimps take out swords and it was classic. so then i hug Dyl talk to jess for a while and ride home.

Then scott tells me about this amazing show with catch and big d neer his dads work and we wanna go so bad and yeah. it shall be grand.

Now im off to nonnies with lisa and kara.

"event","hey guys... Phish broke up </3 </3. First time I ever heard of phish was at camp with Adrienne and Zack. Poster is dead - hit by a commet. thats not the name of the ""song"" or aything. that is harpona. you might wanna check the spelling of that. anyway. it was very upsetting. because we had been thinking avbout them a lot the past two days and didnt know why. then we found out they broke up. May 25th 2004. yes, the summer tour is still on. i dunno how many people asked me that.dyls going to a show. i really want to. dyl's gonna see if her sister will take us to their last show. that would be spectacular. yes.

off subject. its memorial weekend suckaaa! mhmm. last night i went and saw shrek two with law and jess. me and jess were gonna walk home from school but the weather killed that plan. so we got a ride. then proceded to walk to pennings. awesome day. shrek was good. i dunno if it was as good as the first one. jess and law were convinsed it was bettter. i think rach was right though. shrek on crack. and apparently the person sitting behin law was gonna kill her. so we had to sprint out of the thearter..... but i got a phish and pennywise cd at the mall. along with multitudes of candy.

today! i woke up and went to a yardsale in pine. where i saw jons neighbor and was thoraly confused for who knows how long. mr. micferson. i like him though. so then i went to the country dream for pancakes. went home showered went to town with kara. we ate and chilled and drove! kara got her permit and can now drive us around. shes a good driver. well... yes. good driver. not good parker. or turnner into roader. but its all good. i love her anyway <3. Then i went out for ANOTHER meal and almost exploded. but im ok. so i came home and changed my livejournal format yet again. i like this one. i tink ill keep it for a while. but the way it says ""in that moment"" on the bottom.

ok well ill leave you now. and put this link back in my info. lattttterrrrrr

DUDE! the ""L"" in the staples name is in the shape of a half bent staple!!! i never noticed that. a always thought it was so weird. wow anyway. thank god im blonde. so saturday i went shopping and got a skirt which im wearing to school toamorw. i like it. law doesnt but its all good. its black with blue poka dots. then law came over went to toms and law came over again. toms was neat it was me her him jesse pat kay meg steph. and me and law managed to paly mario cart. im not as bad at it as i was last time i played it. i got third a bunch of times and i think i was gonna get 2nd then i turned around right at the end for some reason. then law slept over. and we played a couple hours of uno. including two hour long games. and we talked forever. about absolutely everything... absoluutely...oh and i ran yesterday. track soon. im running 400 hurdles?? yeah. apparently jess is teaching me to hurdle. alright well im gonna go now. i gotta go find plans. later.

abbate is a pot head 
oh cant you see
he smokes much more 
than you or than me
he talkes about creek
because he dont suck
like him or hate him
he dont give a fuck
his friends hate his hat
they say he should cuck it
but he just says
ah fuck it
hed have a mullet
if his mother would let him
and hes got scars
becasue his brother beats him
abbate is a pothead
abbate is a pot head 
oh cant you see
he smokes much more 
than you or than me

so thats the abbate song. when we make a record its going on there. so yeah. boarding was ok. the pipe sucks when you got the the part thats slanted up. well straight up. abbate knows the name. i dont. um kurt moved today. just letting you know. to floroda. lucky him. but i didnt get to say good bye... anyway. then today my father had surgery. and he was gone most of the day. so i had diet sprite and oreaos for two meals. chineese for the other one. and i had guitar today. mark things im in the kgb. its all good. hes doing great. my dad not mark. mark too. and i picked up this niftty guitar riff for guttermouth. i like it. but apparently jon is cooler becasue he can play on the outs?? no wait jons cooler becasue he can play half of on the outs. weird kid. really weird kid. so yeah. um today honors math had a feildtrip. so there were like .438 people in al my classes. and the only class i had to do stuff in was math. now ive got the abbate song in my head. well it think im gonna go rawk out. becasue im billy idol like that. yeah.

(oh and eric knows my cusin from mass! i dont think thats a good thing bit its ok..) so we chill at the mall and i return shitloads of stuff and only buy stuff at the dollar store. then we wetre in hot topic and jesse calls laws cell so he says hey come over after the mall so we do and we watch billy madison. because me and law didnt see it / didnt see all of it. it was great. another one of the three movies i recogmend today. yeah. that was the end of a wonderful break. i want spring to come. becasue summers soon after that and i love summer. over srring break were gonig some plce warm! my dad was trying for turks and cacois. i heard it was great. especially from mrs fuca?? yeah. but i wanna go to florida and see tim...... who knows. yeah or vegas. we might go to vegas. cheep air fare. im not complaining.

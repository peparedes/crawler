"event","My life has gone to shit.Everyday I wake up and I feel this incredible pain in my chest and it wont go away and it hurts so bad.I lost the only girl that I have ever loved.She runs through my mind every second of every day.I cant sleep because I am on these stupid depression medications, and when I lean over at night she isn't there and I cry myself to sleep.The echoing sounds of her laughter lingers in my mind and breaks my heart more and more.The other day at work, an elderly man said to me,""whats the matter son,you looked like someones died."" And I replied to him,""Yeah, I did."" I feel so lonley, and so sad and depressed.I hate my life, so very much.Fuck you world!Give me back my love,give her back to me please.I'd die for her... I'd walk to the end of the world and back for her.Please dont make me hurt another day.Please..."

"event","Om my fucking God ... I hate his stupid ass world... I am so fucking pist and i dont know what to do ... because I really feel like doing something bad right now. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... I want to cry and scream, and go crazy... 
I dont really care anymore... I need to write this down right now ... but it doesn't even matter to those of you who know.I was in a mental house because I wanted to commit suicide and for the main reason because I am a cutter.A cutter is a person who cuts themselves ... (pretty obvious).So yeah, I was a cutter.I feel like cutting myself right now,but i cant because i cant do that anymore.I bet you wonder why people cut ... well even if you dont, I will tell you.You know the times when you are so mad and sad and feelin' really down.You know the times when you just want to scream out as loud as you can and punch something.Well for us cutters, we cant scream and punch because either we cant or because it doesn't help.The only way for us to let everything out is to cut ourselves to let it out.I really want to cut right now.It keeps running through my head.I just have the urge to, and I keep seeing myself doing it in my head.i have scars on my arms and chest from me doing it.
FUCK ALL THIS SHIT!!!! PEACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Hey everyone, it's been a long time since I have written. I have a lot of new stuff going on. &nbsp;I got my drivers license and I am really excited. School sucks, but I am trying to good so that I can drive around everywhere. My dad doesn't want me driving unless I have good grades so I have to do good. Plus I want to get my insurance lowered by getting on the good student program. I love to drive around everywhere, and since my grades aren't to good my dad doesn't want me to drive anywhere that I want to go... he only lets me drive to places where he wants me to go, like to go do something for him or my mom, go figure. But I don't mind to much to go out and do stuff for them because it gets me out of this house. There is so much drama at this house. I kinda care but I try to block it out. Everyone went to a bon-fire today at the beach but I couldn't go because I wasn't allowed to drive the car there, and george rode with Marrissa and Peter had to go somewhere to see his dad and it was out of the way, and Chris,Steven and Candice got a ride with Nick, and Nick had one more seat left in the car, but he said that it was too crowded. I know that he just didn't feel like picking me up and talking me too, but I dont really care, because I went out with Stephanie to dinner and it was nice. The baby and Stephanie have been over a lot latley and I like it. The baby is 4 months old now. She will be five months on the 18th, and she is getting so old now. She started to eat baby food the other day. She is trying to talk now, but all she is saying is goo-goo, and gaa-gaa, and Eeeee, and sometimes she just kinda screams. I love my baby so much, and I was looking at a picture the other day of me when I was a little baby and I was eating some beef-stew, and she looks just like me. I am so excited to have a baby. She has a lot of my facial features and we are still waiting to see if her eyes change a different color because Stephanie had blue eyes just like Elizabeth until she was 1 year old and then they changed, so she thinks that they will change to brown. I don't care what color she has because she is still the cutest fuckin' baby ever.(Or so I think)I think she will probably have Stephanie's personality because she doesn't really have her facial features and she has to have something of her, so she will probably have her personality. Well I will talk to you all later about more stuff.Bye everyone."

"event","Hey! Spring Break fucking rocks this year!!!! So far I have done something every day of spring break with all my homies. I just got home right now and me and Chris just took some funny ass pictures at his house. He's going to put them on right now. Well spring break is great and its going to suck when we have to go back to school. I take my drivers test on the 14th and I think I will get it. I hope I get it! Stephanie takes it the same day that I do, and me and her are very competitive, so thats not a good thing.If I dont get it, and she does, then I'm going to be pissed, but its okay because I still love her. Well I'm gonna go party now so I will talk to you guys tomorrow. Later!"

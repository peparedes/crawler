My mom stayed there with her "" boyfriend"" Randy , and let me come down here I am staying with my aunt , and uncle . Its so different living with them , they are much more strict , and very cynical .It kind of annoys me . Ive been dealing with some bullshit drama . MY EX cause a whole bunch of shit , she went on my screen name , and ""was just talken mad shit"" what can you expect out of an X ... there is a reason your not with them for a reason . I am almost ashamed to admitt I know her ... Everything that comes out of that hoes mouth is a mother fucken lie . she went on my name , telling my best friend I died in a car crash , and then to this girl I liked named pixy , basically a whole bunch of stupid dumb lying bullshit ,. she even has the nerve to go around teling people she broke it off with me .. HAHA trick .. your fucken funny .. I broke it off with her , 3 weeks after .. I liked her best friend { pixy } I think I realised that shit . and then to my fucken girl sami . that bitch is half of my life , and to try to take that shit from me  you must be insane .How could someone be so heartless I mean to go on MY NAME AND TALK SHIT , ITS KINDA LIKE WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU .. I CAN HONESTLY SAY IF SHE DIED id probably be like damn ... that sucks ..anyways  so besides wanting to kill her , my boyfriend and I are alright ... we always work so the communication thing is kinda whack and whatever . but I guess its somehting that you will take for granted one day . I guess this is the true test of if we should even be together .... Hopefully everything will work out , if not .. there are always other people ,whether or not they are better is beyond my beleif .=/ Im about to bounce . Ill hit this shit back up later .... peace !"

"event","!!!MY FAVORITE SONG !!!!

[Slug]
If I was a rich man
I'd buy you some shoes
Tall boots for all the dirt you walk through
What would that do?
Enable you to deal
Without schooling you on how to touch what's real
And if I was a smart man
I'd tell you everything that I knew
And give it to you every time you need a talking to
But what would that do?
Teach you my guidelines
So you can be a cheerleader at your game on the sidelines
And if I was a driver
I'd keep my headlights on
To see the difference between right and wrong
I'd wear my seatbelt even when I'm in park
Cause I don't trust the other fools that cruise through these parts
And if I was a better cook
I'd hook up a feast
Set a table full of food for the children to eat
I encourage the nourishment so we can breathe
With the knowledge that we got something accomplished

Chorus:
And if I was Santa Claus, I'd fight for the cause
Wouldn't expect nothing in return
I'd give you everything you want, I'd be everything you need
So you can take my hand and I can take the lead

And if I was an honest man
I would stop writing songs
I'd break for a nervous breakdown for breakfast
Tell everyone I knew to stay away from making music
It ain't nothing but a confusing mess (confusing mess)
And if I was you, I wouldn't hear a word I said
Wouldn't trust nothing to start it up inside my head
I'd make a conscious effort to live instead
Of trying to kill the monsters that reside underneath the bed
And if I was a hurt man
I'd find a way to put my faith 
Into a woman that could take me from today
Maybe
I need somebody that could save me
From the parts of myself that keep making me crazy
And if I was a wise man
I'd climb to the top of the mountain peak
To think about strength versus weakness
I'd find a point that rests a couple of feet above your head
And figure out how I could try to help you reach it
(Ho ho ho)
And if I did have a choice
I'd never want to live forever
Just let me have a voice so I can make my points
I can't imagine running a race with no finish line
Just let me keep my pace and make to most of my time
I love giving but I'm bad at receiving
The truth is, I'd prefer to be the one bleeding
But I'm a paranoid that stays between play and work
Cautious and aware, 'cause I'm afraid of being hurt
Which brings me to the issue
And that would be this:
How often must I ask myself why I exist?
I feel like a freak, this world is a circus
Just trying to find myself as well as my purpose

Chorus:
And if I was Santa Claus, I'd fight for the cause
Wouldn't expect nothing in return
I'd give you everything you want, I'd be everything you need
And you can take my hand and I can take the lead (2x)

I got nothing but gifts
Keep it up in my wits
Got me drunk on the fifth
And now we're stuck in a ditch
And as dumb as it gets
I'mma run you some fibs (?)
I wanna touch your lips
I wanna rub your hips
Put a glove on the fist
For the love that exists
We'll keep bumping the hits
To get my bucket of chips
From the Bloods and the Crips
To the skateboarding chicks
Put the Atmosphere on your Christmas wishlist (2x)"

I think everyone is just so fabulous I tend to forget people back stab , and fuck you over just as fast as they can count to 5 . I sit here , wondering ? what is it all worth >? what is the pain of a so called friendship worth ? if they are your best firend , if they are as the title proclaims .. "" the best "" why do you need any more ? if they were the best youd only need one , right ? because the best would be able to fu-fill everything for you ? i dont get it . megan is in boston , I miss her dearly but then again maybe the break with her leaving will , set us free . meaning maybe it will bring us closer or make us realise we arent meant for eachother . I dont want togive up but what is left ? I care so much , but its like once agan ? what is it all worth .  ? the pain   ? I love her with all my heart can give her , but ... Its like maybe we shold move on ? or maybe we should just both shut the fuck up and realise we are meant to be .. I dont know anymore I just want to be happy . But after all the questions and the ignorant drama .  I have met this lovely girl named ahmber . she is so great ... I<3 her hehe =) she is so down to earth . and . whats that word .... hmmm : thinking ::: Perfect =) she lives so far  but we need to continue talking because Im willing to move some day down the road , shes definatly worth it .. but im out ....

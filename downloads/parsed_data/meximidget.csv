On Friday i went to lazer quest w/ Katie, Katie's cousin, and Katie's frenchy!!! it was soooo much fun b/c we got to play a game with just us four. It was kinda scary b/c there was 4 of us in a huge, dark place with loud scary music playing...but it was still fun. On Saturday i went to Alicia's bday party at bjs. It was...interesting, but very fun! I had a really good time!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALICIA!!! Then i came home and went to bed and Ben called me at like 11:30 b/c he had just gotten home from Big Toe. So i talked to him for awhile. Then on Saturday i got up and went to church and then after that Ben and I went to go see the Grudge. The movie itself was terrible, but it still kinda scared me! I was squeezing Ben's arm so hard i'm suprised i didn't break it off!!! Then after that i went to go work at the Fall Festival at church. It was fun! Ben and i worked the balloon pop thingy but the stupid plastic darts kept breaking so i had to go home and get real darts...ya that was interesting watching little 1st graders throwing these sharp things at balloons....sigh good times good times!!! lol!! <BR>OOOH!!! and tomorrow is Ben and my 1yr and 4 mnth anniversary!!! yippee!! lol its crazy!!! 1 year and 4 months!! man thats a long time-especially for my 1st boyfriend!! Ya i'm sooooooooooo(times infinity) lucky to be with such an awesome guy! He's an AMAZING Christian guy who treats girls with respect, and can make me laugh even if i'm in the worst mood ever!

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ffccff>so today at like 1 i got my hair cut and rehighlighted!!!!! instead of getting my red highlights, i got auburn colored streaks in my hair. OMGosh it looks sooooo cool!!!! I love it!!!!! </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ffccff>Today is&nbsp;a&nbsp;day&nbsp;that will forever dwell&nbsp;in my heart and mind. My mom, brother and i went to taco bell for lunch. In the middle of us eating this homeless lady walked in, the ONLY thing she had with her was her Bible. She sat down at the table next to us and started reading it. A lady had been standing in line and just received her food and walked over to the homeless lady and gave her two tacos. The homeless lady immediately grabbed her chest and pulled her cross necklace from under her blouse. She turned to us and said, ""God sure works in mysterious ways"" Wow that seriously tugged at my heart. She told us that she was in there just trying to get out of the heat because she almost passed out b/c of how hot it was. My mom went up to the counter and asked for a complimentary cup so she could give the lady some water. The guy behind the counter, he looked about 17 or 18, asked if it was for the lady. My mom told him it was, thinking that he wasn't going to let her get the water for the lady, but instead he reached for the larger sized drink instead of the complimentary cup and told my mom to give her anything she wants. The lady was just so excited! She said how truly blessed she was. When she said that i couldn't help to cry. Here is this homeless lady who has probably not eaten in a few days sitting in a Taco Bell reading the Bible and praising the Lord!!! It just shows what Chris was talking about at Church, this homeless lady had planted a seed in all of us there at Taco Bell. She taught me a lesson. She has almost nothing worth money, but she has the most precious possession, a relationship with Christ. I don't think i could ever forget today...it really impacted my life. </FONT></STRONG></P>"

God is soooo amazing!! i was so stressed but He just calmed me down. One because in Teen Leadership today we had a ""campfire"" which was really logs w/ christmas lights wrapped around them, and we just answered some questions. It was so relaxing and comforting to hear what other people value in their lives. It just relieved all of my stress!! It's so amazing b/c God knew that i had that physics test today and that i would be driving myself insane worrying about it so he allowed my mind to be taken off of physics and enjoy a day of relaxation in teen leadership.</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ffff33>this is how it goes:</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ccffff>&nbsp; ""girls are like apples on trees, the best ones are at the top. Most boys don't want to reach for the good ones b/c they are afraid of falling and getting hurt. Instead, they just get the rotten apples that are on the ground, that aren't as good, but easy. So the apples at the top think there is something wrong w/ them when in reality they are amazing. That is why we just have to be patient and wait for the right boy-the one who takes a chance to find the good and right apple will come someday.""</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ffffff>is that not the cutest thing ever!!!!</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ffccff>so ya its tuesday....terrific tuesday....right. ya know how everybody hates mondays? i think everyone should hate tuesdays. here is my reasoning....</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ffccff>monday is the beginning of the week which means that anything could happen. monday determines whether or not you'll have a good week...therefore mondays should be enjoyed.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ffccff>wednesday is the day that churches usually have their youth groups which provide as a venting day where you can get support from others your own age. it is also the middle of the week so once you reach wednesday you know you made it half way.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ffccff>thursday is a good day because after thursday is friday!!! so once you get past thursday everything is just peachy</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ffccff>friday...well everyone loves friday because after school is the weekend!!!! </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ffccff>but tuesday....tuesday is a nothing day... there is nothing exciting about tuesday....</FONT></STRONG></P>

The guy i'm talking about is named Jesus Christ. He is the ONLY perfect guy to ever walk on the face of the earth.

Yesterday at around 4:00 pm, I heard the terrifying news that Scott Larson had been killed in Iraq. I was stricken with disbelief. How could this happen?? My heart and prayers go out to the Larson family. I have no idea what they must be going through, I just pray that God comforts them throughout the whole thing. Scott Larson lost his life fighting to keep ours safe. He is a hero in my eyes. His death was a very noble death. Lets not be brought down by his death, let us rejoice! For now he is in the BEST place possible sitting next to our Creator. God had planned this way back in the past, before we even knew Scott or any of the Larson's. Thats got to be a comforting thing. 

Scott, I never officially met you, but you are my brother in Christ and I love you very much and want to thank you for everything you have unknowingly done for me. You are truly and inspiration!I can't wait to get to heaven so I can meet you."

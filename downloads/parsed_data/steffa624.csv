<div align=""left""><strong><font size=""4"">I had the chance to go back to Mexico during spring break this year, and since that trip finding the joy I once had has been the underlying prayer of my heart.&nbsp; I went to Mexico seeking rest and hoping to leave some baggage and hurt behind me.&nbsp; The trip took me out of my element just enough that I had to feel all of the emotions that I had been numbing at home and allowed me to be myself again.&nbsp; I didn't want to leave.&nbsp; Here I am not myself right now because of the many restrictions of my injury and my own inability to handle it all correctly.&nbsp; I am in no way fully where I need to be yet, but returning home has made me face some issues I have been running from, and I've been learning a lot since that trip.&nbsp; Lesson #1: God doesn't give us a path, God IS the path. I have stressed and stressed and re-stressed over whether or not I should quit soccer.&nbsp; It is in my nature to analyze things because I've always been taught to weigh my options and pick the ""right"" choice.&nbsp; While I have sought peace, I have found restlessness.&nbsp; I am now beginning to understand that there is not always a ""right"" choice, sometimes it's just a choice. (And how blessed I should feel to have that choice)&nbsp; Wasting my time on discovering the pros and cons of each option has only dug me farther and farther into a hole that has kept me nowhere.&nbsp; I am learning that God often places us in circumstances that are unclear in order for us to choose Him first and walk second. Deuteronomy 30:11-16 says ""This command I am giving you today is not too difficult for you to understand or perform.&nbsp; It is not up in heaven, so distant that you must ask, 'Who will go to heaven and bring it down so we can hear and obey it?'&nbsp; It is not beyond the sea, so far away that you must ask, 'Who will cross the sea to bring it to us so we can hear and obey it?'&nbsp; The message is very close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart so that you can obey it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now listen.&nbsp; Today I am giving you a choice between prosperity and disaster,&nbsp; life and death.&nbsp; I have commanded you to love the Lord your God and to keep his commands, laws and regulations by walking in His ways.&nbsp; If you do this, you will <u>live</u>.""&nbsp; Lesson #2: God grants ALL of us a place of belonging. This hasn't always been an easy thing for me to see.&nbsp; I could quote you a million verses that say ""He will never leave us or forsake us"" and that He is ""with us always"", but I can't say that I have felt it in the past several months.&nbsp; If you dig a little deeper into who Christ was speaking to when he said these things you can discover why we sometimes feel alone.&nbsp; Christ was not speaking to people who had already figured everything out.&nbsp; He was not speaking to individuals who had their lives planned out for themselves.&nbsp; Christ spoke to the <u>desperate</u>.&nbsp; He spoke to people who were grateful for what He had done for them, people who were generous in serving Him, and people who were willing to courageously take risks for the cause of Christ.&nbsp; This requires a life and attitude that is selflessly devoted to one thing...HIM.&nbsp; It doesn't involve looking at the minor things (which when self-focused can seem VERY major things) in life, but instead focuses solely on Christ, trusting that He will take care of the rest.&nbsp; Soccer is what I have desired for my ENTIRE life... I have been desperate to return to <u>it</u>,&nbsp; taken many risks to pursue <u>it</u>, felt out of place without <u>it</u>, all the while questioning God as to why He would take such a precious thing away.&nbsp; <u>It</u> is why I have felt alone.&nbsp; God does not place blessings in our lives to replace Him, He gives them to us to glorify Him.&nbsp; While soccer has given me many opportunities to share Christ and what He has done for me, having it taken away is allowing me to redefine just how glorious He is, and how little I am.&nbsp; Lesson #3: When we belong to Christ, joy is contagious.&nbsp; This brings a few individuals in my life to mind.&nbsp; In recent months I have continued to see the joy of one of my friend's infect those around her.&nbsp; I've made many a trip to see her just to get a taste of that joy.&nbsp; I have also been blessed to see that type of joy restored to another one of my friends, and it has in turn been a HUGE blessing to me.&nbsp; Where do they find it? and how do they keep it? This is a question that I am still learning how to answer fully, but one thing I am learning is that JOY is a choice.&nbsp; It is not based on circumstances and happenings, but is based on who we are in Christ.&nbsp; You can't fake it and you can't hide it.&nbsp; It is attractive, infectious, and it does not allow our countenance to be defeated because it is not based on ANYTHING but CHRIST.&nbsp; I will return to the doctor this Friday with these lessons in hand.&nbsp; I still am unaware of what decisions will be made and what questions will remain, but I will follow Him, will be reminded that I belong to Him, and will continue seeking the type of Joy that will never allow me to leave a room the same way I found it.</font></strong><font size=""4""><font color=""#00ccff""><strong> </strong></font></font></div>

BUT, &nbsp;the constant&nbsp;daily reminder&nbsp;that the&nbsp;pain brings is starting to wear on my emotions...is this really possible, and why in the world am I doing this to my body?&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot help&nbsp;but wonder if&nbsp;this is truly the place&nbsp;I am supposed to be in life right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I&nbsp;wasting my time on this venture purely because I cannot find the strength to let go of my sport, or is this&nbsp;a test to discover if I am willing to pursue a greater purpose for my life??&nbsp; I <em>still</em>&nbsp;feel like&nbsp;I'm in limbo.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand I am terrified to death&nbsp;of letting go of soccer...losing&nbsp;it&nbsp;would mean losing so many other things in life and would require a tremendous leap of faith to do...but on the other hand I fear that&nbsp;if&nbsp;I stay where I am that it will destroy me...the pain is wearing and the atmosphere that I am in is lacking in encouragement and happiness to say the least...I feel very alone and misunderstood.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soccer has always been a sarifice of time, but playing was always a reward that outweighed the negatives...&nbsp;is it still worth it without the ability to play?&nbsp;&nbsp;So many questions are unanswered right now, and so much&nbsp;advice has been thrown in my direction.&nbsp; Some say to <u>quit</u>, that&nbsp;I have been given talents and abilites that cannot be utilized until I find a way to let go.&nbsp; Others&nbsp;say <u>stay</u>, that God is using me with my team and with all of those around&nbsp;me because of the battle&nbsp;with&nbsp;pain that I have continued to fight with&nbsp;my faith.&nbsp; I don't know what to do at this point...both choices seem logical, both make sense, yet I cannot find peace in choosing either one.&nbsp; I want His will for my life...but I can't seem to hear it clearly.&nbsp; I am out of ideas.&nbsp; I know that obedience often requires us to be patient, but I don't want to&nbsp;just sit around while&nbsp;my life passes me by, and I don't think that&nbsp;God wants me doing nothing&nbsp;and being miserable either.&nbsp; I still don't understand why I am where I am...and I am still unsure of what exactly God is doing&nbsp;in my life right now...but I do&nbsp;think that in order to see just how powerful HE is, God is asking&nbsp;me to wait.&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting SUCKS...when that word comes to mind I automatically think about being delayed, or wasting my time while anticipating the thing that actually has value...waiting rooms&nbsp;&nbsp;have always seemed like a waste of time to me, why not just schedule an appointment 15 minutes later so you can go straight in?&nbsp; What I often fail to remember (often because I can't see it)&nbsp;is the preparation that occurs during that waiting period.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is during that time that the&nbsp;service/thing that&nbsp;I anticipate so much is being prepared.&nbsp; Scripture reminds me that Christ does the same thing with us...it says&nbsp;that He&nbsp;refines us and perfects&nbsp;us during those times.&nbsp; Scripture also reminds me that&nbsp;I am not alone as I wait, and that I have been put in this place for a specific purpose...I HAVE to&nbsp; continue believing that.&nbsp; And because that is my belief, I must continue&nbsp;finding ways&nbsp;to discover joy in where I am...the pain OFTEN distorts my view&nbsp;making it nearly impossible to see&nbsp;the beautiful things that could be going on outside of it.&nbsp; I still don't think quitting is the right thing right now.&nbsp; While choosing to do so would be scary, I almost feel like it is an easy way out.&nbsp; It would solve SO many issues, but I don't think my heart would be content.&nbsp; In the mean time...I'm working on not letting&nbsp;my foot or the advice of&nbsp;others direct my decisions and I'm seeking happiness and joy from the ""little things"" life throws my way..I'm&nbsp;trusting that Christ will&nbsp;continue to direct my heart and that He will comfort me as I wait for the ""thing"" He is preparing for me :).</font></strong></p>"

Nothing is impossible for Him, and nothing is impossible with Him.&nbsp; Tonight I go to sleep in peace, knowing that good or bad, His will shall be done..and for that, I should be filled with joy and excitement for all of the tasks that are about to be at hand.&nbsp; I will be anxious for nothing, and will ask Him to take over everything.&nbsp; He shall be first, and I must be last.&nbsp; I have been given an incredible opportunity that can be taken away in an instant.&nbsp; I must use it for His purpose every moment that I can with everything that I have.&nbsp; I will not let fear overpower me.&nbsp; I will not let fear paralyze, intimidate, or prevent me from completing His tasks.&nbsp; I will press on, I will be courageous, I will be passionate, I will be untouchable in His hands.&nbsp; I will not be harmed.&nbsp; He will be my unyielding protection.&nbsp; Men may say, do or imply things to frighten me, but they will ""wither like blades of grass"".&nbsp; I will press on, just as Christ did for me, enduring the seemingly impossible, knowing that the end result is worth giving up my life!&nbsp; He is why I am here.&nbsp; He is why I live, and I will live freely and courageously as He did for my life. ""I shall run and not grow weary, I shall walk and not grow faint.""

<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4><STRONG>I was faced with the reality of the extent of my injury yet again at my most recent doctor's visit. My foot continues to decline and soccer has further slipped from my view. BUT, this is where it ends. This is where I stop showing my wounds to everyone around me, and this is where I stop living life out of my pain and hurt. Christ gave His LIFE...HIS LIFE...so that I could live mine HEALED..so why am I walking around wounded?? He has created and designed for me to be exactly where I am, doing specifically what I have been doing...with a hurt foot, no soccer, and all that it encompasses. THIS IS NOT AN OBSTACLE...it's not something I have to overcome and it's not a weakness that can hold me back from fulfilling the purpose that He has for me. I MADE IT THAT, and it's not going to upset me or control me anymore...it is merely an opportunity and blessing for me to be faithful and obedient in the role He has called me to. Although it may seem insignificant and minor in comparison to what my heart yearns for, it is VITAL because it is where He has placed me. Until I can accept and embrace the role He has given me, how can I ever expect Him to trust me with more? Pastor Dino reminded us today that David was only brought to His place of victory and triumph because his heart was faithful in the small things. He never would have met his Giant and&nbsp;defeated it had he not first taken care of his sheep and made the humble journey of bringing his brothers bread to the battle field. David knew his role, excepted it, embraced it, and stopped there. He wasn't looking for something greater because His heart found joy in being exactly where he was, doing the simple tasks he was called to do. It was God that brought him to his giant, and it was God that that provided him with the perfect timing and the perfect strength for his victory. I am where I am...and my heart embraces it because it's exactly where I am supposed to be.</STRONG></FONT></P>"

I AM NOT MY OWN...we are called to live a life that reflects our creator, and we are to do His work and love his creations as we love ourselves---REGARDLESS of the return.&nbsp; What I struggle with more than anything is trying to live that way&nbsp;without reaching&nbsp;the point where I feel empty and unable to give anymore...I start to feel sorry for myself.&nbsp; Our world tells us that when we reach this point we need to search for things to satisfy us...screw&nbsp;how everyone else feels, look out for number one, demand the love, respect and attention that you ""deserve"" and THEN youll be happy.&nbsp; That sounds nice and all...but every time I've tried that option I end up right back to where I was before.&nbsp; Why?...because I AM NOT MY OWN...I don't ""deserve"" anything, and&nbsp;if&nbsp;I live my life with that attitude it discredits the fact&nbsp;that my life is a&nbsp;gracious, gracious&nbsp;gift.&nbsp; The new option I've discovered....the new option that actually let me sleep last night...says that I was created for a greater purpose than that of pleasing myself and that the <EM>lasting </EM>satisfaction that I yearn for&nbsp;IS possible...but&nbsp;only if I seek it through Him and Him alone.&nbsp;""[His] purpose is to give life in&nbsp;ALL of its fullness""-John 10:10, and He knows full well exactly how to do that.&nbsp; Today my heart is full and my mind is at rest because He has given me a life and love to share and NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.&nbsp;I am satisfied.</FONT></STRONG>"

He was selfless and loving to EVERYONE despite how much they&nbsp;rejected him.&nbsp; I'm extremely confused...I try very hard to&nbsp;be a friend that is dependable and loving, but&nbsp;I fear at times that I'm&nbsp;doing something wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't put on the happy face anymore, I can't act like everything's peachy....it's not.&nbsp; I have ZERO females in my life that&nbsp;I feel like I could go to right now.&nbsp; Yes, there is Erin and Kathryn....there is Artie, Michelle, Lisa...but none that are here day to day to have to lean on. I was hurt very deeply by&nbsp;one of my closest friends a while back and it has damaged my ability to trust girls ever since...I've tried everything to mend the friendship, but at times I wonder why&nbsp;I even bother.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouldn't she be the one putting forth some effort?&nbsp;Shouldn't she be the one trying to make things ok again?&nbsp;Is&nbsp;it to much to ask&nbsp;for her to be there for me for ONCE?...How in the world&nbsp;did&nbsp;I get to this place in my life?&nbsp; I dropped everything...putting my hope in a relationship that looked&nbsp;like it would&nbsp;be lasting...I went against everything people were telling me and chose instead to follow my heart...but it almost feels at times that it&nbsp;was empty because in the end I&nbsp;lost everything.&nbsp; I wish I knew how to start over, but I'm lost.

At the moment of his deepest trial, Christ was able to endure because of the joy he knew was set before him.

(and&nbsp;I didn't even have to bribe&nbsp;Shawn with candy)&nbsp; We didn't have practice yesterday, but we did have weights and running.&nbsp; If you know me at all, then you know that I tried to do&nbsp;a lil&nbsp;much yesterday.&nbsp; Yes, I'm sore...but it was <U>so</U> worth it!&nbsp; I'm looking forward to practice this afternoon, but am extremely nervous.&nbsp; I still haven't kicked straight on with my foot yet, and I'm concerned about how it's gonna feel when I finally do.&nbsp; No worries though...I don't think anything could scare me enough to keep me away from playing at this point.&nbsp;haha...it's freaking me out how giddy I am right now.&nbsp; Anyways, Kate's hosting another recruit this weekend.&nbsp; If this girl signs it will be number 9...making the total count of cuts being made to a minimum of 3.&nbsp; I think everyone on the team is feeling the obvious pressure to preform.&nbsp; While I'm not looking forward to the cuts, the pressure has uped the expectations of work ethic and intensity during practice tenfold...and that's the kind of stuff I live for.&nbsp; Regardless if I end up being let go before the fall or not, it's going to&nbsp;be an amazing ride getting there.&nbsp; I know my game is about to grow a lot from the new coaching&nbsp;and if I can keep up my current attitude...I'm going to be in best shape of my life come August.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kate and I are going to swim after practice and then I will be off to finish up shopping for the Mexico trip with my mom.&nbsp; I've hardly gotten to talk to her at all this week, so I'm looking forward to some quality time at Wal-mart.&nbsp; She's been having a rough time lately...trying to stay healthy herself on top of dealing with her grandmother's death as well as my grandma's declining health.&nbsp; It's weird, and somewhat disheartening, that I can't help her cope with some of that stuff.&nbsp; I know how difficult it is for me to see her in pain from the fibromyaligia...so I can relate that way, but having grown up so far away from my extended family it's hard to feel the same kind of hurt she does.&nbsp; Yes, my great grandmother just passed away and my grandmother is having to go through multiple surgeries...while it's been a little hard I don't think it's affecting me as much as it might most people.&nbsp; That sounds absolutely&nbsp;awful, I know, but I really don't know any of my extended family all that well because of the physical distance between us.&nbsp; The lack of those tight family ties makes me desire something greater for my own family one day.&nbsp; I&nbsp;know I will be close with my children and husband, but I wan't to be able to continue the closeness between my brothers and parents that I have now.&nbsp; More importantly, I want to be able to be just as close to my children's children one day.&nbsp; I've always said that I want to get out of this town...try something new, get a different perspective from a new environment.&nbsp; While I still think that might do me some good, I'm a lot more unsure of how permanent or how far I would want to make that move.&nbsp; Maybe this Mexico trip will give me the taste of change that I've been&nbsp;waiting for.&nbsp; I don't know exactly what I will get from the trip, but I'm going to&nbsp;it open and willing to except whatever God has in store for me.</FONT></STRONG></P>"

I wouldn't give back a single moment.&nbsp; As cliche as it&nbsp;sounds, the blood, sweat and tears that I have put into this game has shaped the greater part of who I am.&nbsp; I joke, but when it's all said and done, and my soccer career comes to an end...I really don't know what I'm going to do with myself.&nbsp; While it's exciting to think about all of the new experiences&nbsp;I'm finally going to have the time to try, I will no longer have the luxury of being involved with&nbsp;developing my passion&nbsp;everyday.&nbsp;&nbsp;We won our&nbsp;second spring game last night.&nbsp; Everyone I talked to that came to the game was astound by how much our team has changed.&nbsp; The girls are relaxed, they finally look like they are having fun again, and slowly the direct style of play&nbsp;that has been drilled into our heads for the past two years is starting to shift to <EM>real soccer</EM>.&nbsp; It's amazing how much the game changes when a team passes...and ACTUALLY attacks forward from the wings.&nbsp;I can't put into words how excited I am about next fall.&nbsp; It's only been two weeks of team training, and the improvements have been innumerable.&nbsp;Today, after Ken and I had kicked around for a while, he asked me about how I felt about the cuts Brian is planning on making.&nbsp; He wanted to know if I thought my injury was going to hurt my chances of staying.&nbsp; Of course that thought has crossed my mind on many occasion...I try to store the anxiety and fear as far back in my head as possible. &nbsp;In reality, it's something that is out of my hands...I don't need to worry about it.&nbsp; I know that, but like I tried to tell him..it's not always easy for me to live out that knowledge.&nbsp; It's hard to ignore something that means so much to you...its hard to wait for answers...I leave for mexico next Friday, and I'm praying that I will&nbsp;be given a new perspective&nbsp;from the trip.&nbsp; The people&nbsp;there are&nbsp;in SO much need, and I have a feeling it's going to hit me pretty hard.&nbsp; In the grander scheme of things, what has been going on with me is NOTHING compared to what&nbsp;I could have been hit with.&nbsp; I thank God for the protection He has faithfully and consistently covered me with, and I ask Him to forgive me for doubting so often.</FONT></STRONG></P>"

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#330033 size=4>Hunter's grandfather passed away yesterday.&nbsp; It was less than a month ago that he was diagnosed with leukemia and I know that Hunter's having a rough time right now.&nbsp; This is the fourth person in his family to pass away in the past year and he just got finished trying to deal with the loss of his grandma during Christmas.&nbsp; I don't ever know how to help in these kind of situations.&nbsp; It seems like the people I am surrounded by are being&nbsp;continually hit with&nbsp;difficulties right now and it's starting to give me understanding for the kind of year&nbsp;I just went through.&nbsp;I don't know why bad stuff happens to people, but I do know this now: It seems that God often strips us of the things we love most in this world so that we will look up and find something greater to hold onto.&nbsp; Every tear that we shed, every pain that we have, and every sorrow that we face HAS A PURPOSE BEHIND IT.&nbsp; I know it's not always easy to see through the hurt, but if we look up there is hope; and in that hope is a lot of comfort and a lot of peace.&nbsp; I hope Hunter can see that.&nbsp; Onto other things, this weekend is our first spring game!!! We play Tulane on Saturday and while I am excited, I'm a lil nervous how the team is going to do with no subs.&nbsp; Oh how I wish I could play right now...Brian gave me a little taste of practice on Wednesday and now I can't seem to shake the ""itch"" to play for real.&nbsp; The good news is, since Nate gave Brian the ok for me to help in one of the practice drills...he finally got to see me play a little bit.&nbsp; The BETTER news, my foot wasn't sore after that!!!&nbsp; Granted, I didn't kick with the bad foot, but any progression is exciting news.&nbsp; Maybe I will get a chance to play this spring after all :)</FONT></STRONG></P>"

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>It is extremely painful to let go of&nbsp;things that weigh so heavily&nbsp;on my heart.&nbsp; A year ago my life seemed to be adding up.&nbsp; The things that I had always believed God created my heart to chase after were starting to become a reality.&nbsp; My hands grasped tightly in excitement at the thought of His promises being fulfilled.&nbsp; Then, He asked me to let go.&nbsp; It has been almost five months since I've been able to touch a soccer ball and it's been six months of being without one of the most meaningful relationships I've ever had.&nbsp; As much as I try to deny, forget, and move forward...learning to live without those two things hurts.&nbsp; With&nbsp;team practice having started last week and having seen Jeremy this past weekend I became a little more than overwhelmed.&nbsp; Without soccer I am finding myself with very little places to ""vent""...the place that I feel most like myself, least stressed, and most alive has been put on hold all because of a tiny bone no bigger than the size of my thumb.&nbsp; It seems the more I try to push forward and recover, the more my foot fights back, so I'm left to sit and watch.&nbsp; It's exciting&nbsp;yet frustrating all in one to sit on the side and watch my team progress under new coaching.&nbsp; WOW.&nbsp; The team is going to be amazing next fall...I just don't know if it's in His plans for me to be there with them.&nbsp; Brian has yet to see me play a single minute of soccer and it freaks me out. Because of a little stubbornness on my part, a little impatience..not having the surgery when I could have...a man that I hardly know will&nbsp;determine the fate of the rest of my soccer carrer without ever seeing me play.&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as mending a friendship with Jeremy...I just can't be myself around him anymore.&nbsp; I HATE IT!&nbsp; No one has ever seen so much potential in me...no one has ever pushed me and made me want to be&nbsp;more than I am like he has.&nbsp; I get so frustrated around him because I feel like he can see all of my faults, but is no longer involved in my life to see how much I am trying to grow.&nbsp; The more I try to ""fix"" things between us the more I seem to mess up the situation.&nbsp; How many times am I going to have to learn this patience lesson?&nbsp; Stressing is getting me nowhere and in the mean time my life is passing me by.&nbsp; It's simple for someone to tell me to not worry about these things...but&nbsp;how do you train yourself to not be concerned about things that you love so much?&nbsp; One thing is for sure...my faith is growing and my trust in His plans for me is strengthening.&nbsp; Any opportuinity that I might have had to sway these situations has been stripped from me and I'm left with nothing but the ability to wait and be hopeful.--""Count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.&nbsp; But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect, complete, and lacking nothing.""</FONT></STRONG></P>"

After one of the longest weeks I have had in a while it was nice to just go chill for a bit.&nbsp; Kate and I went to weights early early (545) so we could go to the pview semi--the girls played REALLY hard, but unfortunately Neuman played that much harder.&nbsp; It was fun to see April and Tina again and I think we all had a good laugh catching up with Coach Bob!&nbsp; ""What is the most dangerous play in soccer girls?""--if any of you ever figure out what in the world that man is talkin about...lemme know would ya?&nbsp; Anyways, after the game I went to console Jon over the loss and sat with him at this authentic mexican resturant...we're talkin NOBODY in there speaking English but us.&nbsp; His food looked really good, but I&nbsp;don't know if I'm ever gonna get the mexican smell out of my coat!!&nbsp; Ken came  and picked me up later on and we headed to Denham for&nbsp;homemade chilli and some quality time with his friends from church.&nbsp; His friends are freakin hilarious...it's not often that you&nbsp;laugh at&nbsp;stories that involve people&nbsp;you dont even know, but they&nbsp;had me smilin the whole night.&nbsp; It's awesome to see a group of college kids able to have a good time all the while being in fellowship with one another as believers.&nbsp; I feel extremely lucky that I'm getting the chance to start to know Ken and his ""posse"" of friends. After the experiences I've had with people in the past few years, God is starting to show me that hoping to find real, genuine people with big hearts was not in vain. He&nbsp;is blessing me with those&nbsp;kind of people BIG&nbsp;time right now and its awesome.&nbsp; There&nbsp;ARE actually people out there who believe what I do, but still know how live a life of excitement and fun and that makes me really excited.&nbsp; Anyways after the girls lost to the guys in this crazy game, we left Denham and met up with Ken's friend Katie, along with Zane, Daniel and two guys I didn't know, to see Constantine.&nbsp; I don't know that I know what to say about that movie...while it was a lil disappointing, sitting between Daniel and Ken was an interesting experience.&nbsp; Their opinions on ""typical females"" cracks me up...hopefully I'll get the chance to let them see that&nbsp;all&nbsp;of us aren't&nbsp; THAT&nbsp;bad.&nbsp; Welp, I've been rambling on for too long and I've got to get to the bball game or Drew is gonna shoot me...HE WON LAST NIGHT (and i missed it :( ...but congrats to the track team, they kicked butt yet again).&nbsp; I'm out...</FONT></STRONG></P>"

"event","<STRONG><FONT color=#6600cc size=4> I don't want perfect. I don't want impressive. I want authentic. Genuine, honest and real regardless of what society expects or desires. I want to be loved. I don't want to need or be needed. Desire should be a strong ""want""...devotion; an interest that does not grow possessive, annoyed, irritated or overpowering. It should feel like an unstated known. No worries, no stress, no apprehension. It should be easy, but not dull. I want excitement; I want captivation, intrigue and mystery. I don't want baggage and I don't want to bring baggage. I want accountability, growth, wisdom...someone who will equally challenge, push, support, and comfort me as I do them. I want someone I can respect. I want someone who can respect and value me. It feels like there is no one left worth pursuing anymore. It feels like no one truly knows what they want at this age. So many things attract us, spark interest, but very few things are worth holding on to. I am frustrated and confused, but I know that anything worth having is worth being patient for. I am choosing to be patient for what I want, and more importantly for what I KNOW God has planned for me. Despite what society is screaming in my face day to day, I refuse to settle for mediocrity...for mere comfort to satisfy temporary ""needs"". God has placed strong desires on my heart and that is what I am waiting for...that is what I want.</FONT></STRONG>"

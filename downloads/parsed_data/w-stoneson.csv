"event","It was a scene that's been painted dozens of times.  Late night.  City corner.  Lady waiting in the glow of a street light.  Then I stroll in.  Suit and a trenchcoat.<br />'Hi Roy,' the lady breathed.  I'll admit she was rather stunning, her dark yellow dress off-setting her red hair with ease I didn't think possible with such shades.<br />'Good evening, ma'am.  I trust you have the files we talked about?' As beautiful as she was, I found this particular scene overplayed.  Maybe its my job, or I really do look as good as they tell me.  But I can't ever remember their names, much less return their affections.  Maybe I would manage to let this one down gently before I walked out of her life.<br />'Of course, but are you really in such a hurry?  I was hoping we could go back to my place for a bit.  You know...have another chat?'  She help up the files invitingly.  I gently pried them from her fingers.<br />'I'm afraid not.  I'll admit you heard all my good small talk the first time.  Here,' I pushed my suitcase into her hand.  'The rest of your payment; a portfolio of some solid investments.  Everything you'll need to finish your new life you said you'd dreamed of.'<br />She stared at me, hurt and shock filling her face.  'I don't...I thought you...you won't come with me?'<br />'I'm afraid not.  I like my current life and would be out of place in yours.'  I slipped the files in my inside pocket.  Looks like she wouldn't take this with grace.<br />She didn't.  Rage filled her face, and then it started...flowing.  Her hair flattened and spread down.  Her nose flattened out, teeth and fingers lengthening.<br /><i>Fuck</i>... I thought, reaching for my gun in my other pocket. <i>A changeling</i>.  I stepped back as it lunged, and tripped.  It bore down on me as we went down, pinning my arm and partially drawn gun.  It pinned my other arm to the side, rearing back for a death bite.<br />I heard a soft click.  Then the changeling's head exploded."

"event","So for starters, I'm stealing something Alison has up, so most of you can skip down a bit:

10 Reasons Why Gay Marriage Should Be Illegal:

1) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.

2) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.

3) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behaviour. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.

4) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.

5) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Brittany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.

6) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old
people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children.

7) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.

8) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.

9) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.

10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans.

Take it, Mark.

They cut down the forest at the end of my street.  It really didn't count as a forest, for it was probably the size of two house lots in all...but the trees and undergrowth are gone.  It looks like a wound, and it looks smaller.  It makes me hurt to look at it.  It held memories, which have now been ripped away.

Sarah, I had a regression the other day.  It's hard to describe the boy I once was, but perhaps paranoid and trying (while miserably failing) to be conniving and manipulative.  Remember stupid questions about purpose?  I got an idea like that in my head, or maybe it just churned up, and someone got subjected to the mood I get in when that happens.  I've thought about it, and realized you would have kicked my ass for it.  Somehow that makes me feel better.  And so, I thank you for your presence, and the memories you've left me.

The braking itself is softer than the other two vehicles.

That way, they open it up and aren't suprised by this big blank space from the bottom of the page.  Instead, you introduce them to the idea by showing them the text at the top of the page.

However, if it is a long letter, you fold it so the bottom bit is on top of the top part.  If it's going to be a long letter, you might as well let them know, so they have a chance to sit down before they're too engrossed.

If you have written so much that it spills onto the back of the page, you're on your own there.

I also saw Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.  My initial impression lasted throughout the movie:  George Lucas put in enough things to line up with the original trilogy, then made the rest of the movie in a ""Well fuck this shit"" attitude.  And the crowds poured in.

There were a lot of scenes that just were not needed.  Like R2 being found by a pair of droids.  And why is R2-D2 so much more tricked out than any other astromech droid anyway?  Where did General Grevious come from, and why must he have a cough?  How is it half a dozen clones can take out each jedi, even the ones with time to fight back, and four times that number fail to stop Yoda and Obi-wan as they enter the temple?  Was it really important that Chewbacca helped Yoda escape?

The rebuilding of Vader was classic Frankenstein.  All it was missing was Palpatine screaming ""It lives!"" and Igor lurking around somewhere.

Though I did like the subtle allusion to Obi-Wan taking Anakin's lightsaber.

Oh, I could go on, but I'm not organized or focused enough to do so."

"event","Soo...Wesley took me out again today.  I leaped for the frisbee - and he slammed into me.  And as I was going up and he had a vertical vector...I was thrown through the air.  Yeah, not a good day for me all in all.

But I got to play with a trebuchet.  Amazing that sieges could be held with those things.  They have got to be the least effective machine out of the three (the other two being the catapult and the ballista cannon).  But it was fun.  I HATE THEM ALL, says Will.  Please, people, it's ""Fire when ready"".  Anything else just pisses us off.

Do you ever wonder about the endless possibilities that you've passed up in life?  I'm fairly obsessed with it myself.  But for all the fantasies and maybies that I run, the current state of events always seems to be the best one available.

I'm taking Will's story into a new medium.  I've wanted to write it down for quite a while, so that he can live on outside of my head.  Now I'm going to try incorporating art into it, and draw his story along with the written.  Any suggestions?"

"event","So I've got a math portfolio to do.  It's a pain, not so much that it's hard so much as there's a lot of it in there.  And there's a few sections I don't know how to simplify into nice presentable forms, so tommorow I have to go beg for some generic non-specific help.  That'll not be fun, believe you me.

I hear we get to do fun stuff in Physics though.  Deflecting objects with magnetic fields.  Fun?  Better believe it.

So I'm goofing off with my scanner, and trying to use one of the pics as my profile pic here.  Not having much luck, until I either figure out how to manually ope Paint Shop Pro or just rescan the drawing and adjust it from there.  Don't need any help, I'll figure it out on my own.
I managed to find equation editor, so I'm not completely helpless.

Ultimate Frisbee is a great game, even in the rain.

My older sister brought over this nifty set of controllers that held several old atari games, all you need to do is plug it into the tv.  I pwned my little sister in Pong.
Or can I technically do that?  Seeing as Pong definately comes from a pre-pwnage era.

Heh, whatever."

Come to think of it, I only ever saw the bit where she's in the machine up to the start of the beach.  Which, roughly speaking, would be somewhere halfway through.

It goes well with what I like to think about God and the cosmos: he created it, and left us to our own devices, sure, but that's a matter of free will.  But it was all set up with rules on how to work.  Random systems are inherently not stable.  And so, laws of nature.  As far as I can tell, there is no contradiction between science and religion.  Just...misunderstandings.

Played Ultimate Frisbee today, like everyday.  But today Wesley slammed me in the face with his arm while we jumped for it.  That hurt.  A lot.  I had to sit out for a while until I could feel my face come back out of my jaw.  He got my arm too.
Not having to play against Danielle was not worth the trade off of not playing with those I feel are more talented players.

"event","So the past few days weren't that great.  Downright shitty in some parts.  Homocidal rages are not good, and I lose perfectly good pencils that way.  So I find ways to cope.  Cheap humor is one.  Ultimate Frisbee calms us down too.  Hitting things would work, but I'm trying to avoid that.  I've even tried tea once.

But when I need a quick fix, I find a visual manner to express it and draw.  Quite therapudic.  I come up with some dark things, but they're really only *quasi* dark.  Would you like to see them?

What's better, my dad hooked up a scanner to our computer.  So after I work out the full capacities, I can easily send them.  Life is good.

"event","I saw The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy last night, and I must say, my soxors were completely roxored.  It was different from the book, but the book was different from the radio show, so that doesn't really concern me.  And they completely made up for it by putting in things special to it, like the activation of the Infinate Improbability Drive.  They all turned into yarn dolls!

I suppose it was a good thing the theatre was mostly empty; it meant I could laugh as loud as I wanted.  Jaclyn too, which we all (should) know about.

Yes, Mark, I can be that risque.  I just keep it to myself until I know what company I'm in.

"event","So I heard this great idea today.  It's called a Time Convention.  Theoretically, you only need to hold one.  Then advertise the heck out of it for all time.  That way, in the future, should we invent time travel, people from the future can come back in time and attend the convention.  And then we get the technology going forward, so anyone in between who wants to attend can come too.  Nor do you have to worry about changing history in the process, because simply by showing up you have already placed yourself in the stream of history, and can't change it anymore.

The only difficulty I see is in figuring out the right tense.  Some sore of combination of past and future...There will be have been a Time Convention on...?

I was recently told that my AIM profile doesn't fit me.  I told him that they're just phrases that catch my fancy.  Besides, if they were all things I said all the time, what would be the fun in reading it?  Maybe he just doesn't know me very well, hmm?"

They are the true power of a country, with the ability to shape people and emotions.  That's the general idea, but I also believe they can exist on a highly localized scale.  And now you've graduated.

What are we supposed to do now?  We've both lost our Sarah.  One is more hurt by the loss than the other, but the fact remains.

In other news, the writers at UPN are very thouroughly kamikaziing the Enterprise series.

"event","I feel a change inside of me.  The urge to write, to chronicle, to record, is being replaced by scribbles.  I want to draw, and the notebooks I use change.  And I'm not even that good of an artist.  But images stick in my mind, strong an vivid and so much better than they appear when they end up on paper.  It bothers me a little, because I understand this urge less than I understand the need to write.

That, and the subject matter.  There was never a subject to writing.  Fire and ice is the most constant occurance so far, though after three variations I've run out of ideas of how to express it, so...

Today in English class I linked Ork to the Dragon in Grendel, then had to stop and silently think about what I said.  Such are my BS powers, I can come up with things without thought, and still find them valid.

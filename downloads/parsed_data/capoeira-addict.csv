i'm only on here again since i was feeling nostalgic and wanted to look through old posts.

i didn't plan on posting but i had a thought.

it kinda sucks how people come and go throughout your life

there's so many people i just don't keep in touch with anymore

so many friends i, at most, chat with occasionally online
but don't make real effort to see again

if you're one of those few that would actually notice this post, i'm probably referring to you and hope that not only you're doing well, but that i will get the opportunity to see you again soon.

"event","Hey hey!

Felt like updating since it's been 6 months.  Here's the short, short version.

February:  turned 25, pretty much nothing else
March:  proposed to Rachel Elizabeth Dintino while on vacation in Mt. Tremblant.  (We went snowboarding, and she thought it was just a getaway to celebrate our anniversary)  She agreed and we had an aMAZing vacation.
Since then, we've been making wedding plans and trying to get things straight.  I knew that marriage was a hassle, but there are times when I'm totally overwhelmed.  Good thing this chica is worth it!
Moved to Liverpool in July and LOVE our new place.  There's an ""adults only"" pool, which means mostly college students, but I can handle that.  No children.  Amen.  Drinking beer in the afternoon by the pool as I get sun and get ogled by horny sorority girls.  I'm sorry, but even I have to admit that does something for a man's ego.  :)  Actually, they're probably lesbians and sharing a private joke about my freakishly white skin that makes me look like Powder.  Need to see that movie again.
Went to Buffalo to visit Tom.  Haven't done that enough.  Felt really guilty for not making more of an effort to see my best friend.  Had a blast though!
Went to Albany for Meghan's birthday.  Had a ton of fun.  Forgot how much I miss my Oswego Ladies.  Too bad how things work out sometimes.
Announced officially our honeymoon plans.  Going to Egypt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

That's all I can think of for now, maybe I'll start using this thing more frequently again.  Who knows, I don't have as many close friends on this thing anymore.  Basically, meghan and rachel will be the only ones to read this in it's entirety i bet.  lol

lotsa love, throw me a bone!"

"event","I think I'm pretty much done with livejournal.  I almost never update anymore and when I do, it's pretty much only because I feel like I should because it's been so long.  My myspace page is keeping me more amused, so if anyone has anything important to share, drop me a line there, or any of the other dozen ways to get ahold of people these days.

This is more for safety purposes than anything else, I know a number of people that have my screen name that may have gotten into my journal and it's not appropriate considering I'm extremely open on here.

If you're interested in seeing the secrets contained within, just ask, you'll probably make the cut!

i have finally moved out people! but i still go home to laguna on weekdays because i just have to have my weekly dose of et and buddy or i'll die. i'll die of depression and you will all mourn my loss. haha :) i mean independence has been okay, but i get really really lonely when i go home (naks! home) from school because i have noone to talk to and its just plain sad! but what i like the most is that when i look out my window, i instantly see the sda building! haha. and i get to yell ""hello sda building!"" (one of my favorite things to do, actually) plus never in my life have i attended a school so incredibly near. its like a 7 minute walk (minus the elevator rides), cause hsiang timed it. 

oh and yes, i have finally gotten proffesional help for my weird icky skin disease. dra. nicholas i am forever grateful! turns out, i have nickel allergy. im actually allergic to the buckles of my polkadotted belts. so i will have to find a better use for those, i just cant throw them out, even if they did only cause me like 100 each. basically im allergic to metal. which explains why i got that weird ear infection months ago, i was allergic to my happyface and make love not war earrings. good thing, i bought plastic ones, so now my ears are okay. and i cant wear jeans with metal buttons, so i have to take the buttons off and replace them with plastic ones. i ccan also get allergies from my glasses. so i might buy new plastic frames. so now, its official.. im a freak."

the sda building is a beauty. im sure it'll radiate even more when it's complete. right now, the insanely long elevator lines are dreadfully annoying, and danny's grill has monopolized the cafeteria food business and the airconditioning sucks big time, but the sda building needs time, it needs time to finish up and kick ass.

its not like ive been going since time in memorial but, i could not miss this! i could not! because i missed last year cause of PLANS! which was boring and last last year cause my parents didnt let me. and naz, invited me three years ago, cause i think this guy who liked her invited her, but i just wasnt into it yet. I WILL SURELY GO NEXT YEAR! next year, next next year, next next next year, well you get my point.

I had painting classes at 10:00-11:30, but i was super not concentrating cause i kept thinking of summer slam! haha. got to faye's house at around 12:00 and waited for rdane, jaja and austin there. then met rdane's crush and rdane's crush's friend. haha. we all took the bus to mantrade, got down, took my favorite mode of transportation, the MRT, then got off at cubao to buy tickets at gateway odyssey but they were all out, so we started walking to the jeepney station, i thik i lost half a pound from all the walking. haha. then we rode the jeep and went to amoranto! wooohooo!

i got tickets at the gate and i finally finally set foot in amoranto. wooohoo. my most memorable moments:
1.seeing diego mapa! gaad! i was 2 feet away from him! HAHAHA! it's funny cause it went like this.. we were standing by the backstage then faye points at some guy and says, thea! tignan mo o si sib, i wanst at all excited, but i looked anyway then i was like staring for 20 seconds then it hit me! pucha! di yan si sib! si diego mapa yan! waaaaaahhhh! hahaha. Faye thought it was sib because they were wearing very similar polos.
2. getting pushed by overly excited urbandub fans moshing. and getting my foot stepped on, it hurt cause i was wearing my strawberry flats! gad! im so stupid, i shouldve worn my slip ons, and to think i was originally planning on wearing flip flops. haha. I pushed this kid towards the mosh pit, he didnt seem to mind, he actually liked it. haha.
3. watching pedicab. hahaha. i was screaming the whole time. they sang their new song! then when they were done with their set and everyone was starting to quiet down i screamed ""shet! sulit ang 200 ko!"" then people in front started looking my way! hahaha. i bent over so they wouldnt see it was me. haha.
4. bote wars! pootek! when sin was playing there very metal songs that cause people to be violent *haha* people seating by the sides started throwing plastic bottles with either water or sand, *i heard, last year there was pee* at our spot, then people from where we were standing started to reatliate so bottles flew from every direction for like 5 minutes, everyone was looking for cover. haha. then when people started to move away, there was this hole in the crowd and then out of nowhere this kid in a skeleton costume started dancing in the middle, then everyone moshed again. haha.
5. getting hit in the head with a bottle full of yellow liquid with the cap still on. *i just hope it wasnt pee* fuck! i have a huge lump on my head which still hurts! i was so pissed i was screaming and cussing for 5 minutes, the best place to hysterically start screaming and cussing is at a rock concert my friends, no on would give a fuck. haha. 
6. when keso, greyhoundz and slapshock started to play, people went wild! faye rdane and i started to move away from the moshing. people started to all stand up and jump around so i could feel people's sweaty arms brushing by my equally sweaty arms! hahaha. but man, i didnt care, everyone was as sweaty as i was. haha. i never thought id have that much fun with sweaty people surrounding me.
7. slipping and almost falling on my ass by the restrooms. hahaha.
thea: walang nakakita nun!
random bystander: meeerrroon! 
haha. pang asar.
8. nabbing myself a pichay poster outside amoranto! hahahaha. pangarap ko tuparin ang pangarap mo! i left it at rdane's house, sayang, ill pick it up asap and post it in my room. whats funny is when we were at san pedro already it started to rain, so i covered my head with the poster. pichay protected me from the rain. 
9. chasing after a moving bus to get a ride.

im excited for next year! i want to go back on may 10 cause there's gonna be a rocked gig, but i dont think my parents will let me. asar! i hope ramon bautista and lourd host again next year, they're hillarious!

there is absolutely nothing productive about today. i hate summer breaks, i hate not having money. i hate mama's kasungitan and how she constantly refuses to give me money to go out. i hate this. i hate fatness and my inabilty to start dieting and exercising. i hate not having summer slam tickets yet, and the fact that im not even sure if im going or not. parents, im not gonna die or get trampled on, i will not mosh. let me go, please please please. let me go! oh gad, i want to go so bad! ive waited for this all year. i hate how papa never listens when i talk to him and how he just agrees to whatever i say, without actually meaning it, just so i'd shut up. i hate how my cable sucks. i hate how i planned to do something artistic this summer and not ever getting around to actually doing it, despite the total lack of things to do. i hate how i constantly tell myself to do better in school but i always end up being too lazy to even try. i hate my laziness. i hate complaining and whining about my laziness and never doing anything about it. tangina, stop complaining and start changing.

aah. babaw teenage hate."

"event","Today did not start so good, I got this weird ear infection, my ears are the fugliest human ears you will ever lay eyes on. fugly fugly fugly. My gad! karma so existss. I think my ear infection is some sort of punishment for being mean to xandra's toe. I mean, i sprained my ankle, now i have ear infection! ok, ok, im sorry mister toe, i never meant to hurt you but please stop karma from punishing me. I've learned my lesson. NEVER MESS WITH THE TOE.

today is happy babaw yickee day number two.

I just came from this party where i knew noone. NOONE! the hosts are friends of my parents before i was even born, i dont know them but they seem nice. I just spent my time stuffing my face with food. because the caterers and cooks gave soo much effort into preparing the food, so I'm trying to make them feel good about themselves and their work by devouring everything i could lay my hands on. haha. takaw!

"event","I am a lame lame child. I try not to go out as much because mama constantly calls me and makes me go home early, and then tells me ""lakwachera ka! lakwachera!"" in a really really fnny way! haha :) I don't think I'll be super extremely enjoying my life until I get a car and learn how to drive. I don't think I'll be going out for a while. 

It's a pitty I didn't get to go out today though, I missed out on recording the first episode of <b>English with Hsiang</b>: <i>An Amazing Talking Machines Production</i>. This is an amazing amazing show conceptualized by carms, xandz and me showing the communication struggles between a Taiwanese girl (Hsiang) and an american boy (Zach). Carms and Xandra will attempt to teach Hsiang proper english grammar and pronunciation, because I've heard that sometimes Zach has absoulutely no idea what Hsiang is trying to say. haha. But basically it concentrates on hsiang trying to learn english. this will be life changing boys and girls. Watch as Hsiang transforms into an english speaking machine spewing grammatically correct sentences faster than you can say ""i feel something special in my special place"".

I must now, fulfill my comelec duties because christopher scares me.
but before that I just have to tell all of you to listen to Hotel Song by Regina Spektor. :)"

"event","I love National Bookstore, I swear if you give me like 100,000 pesos to spend at National Bookstore I'll love you and all the generations before and after you, forever! I'll buy like dozens of HB pencils and loads of paint brushes and paint, I am so gonna go crazy and buy loads of oslo paper and sketchpads and not care about the trees. But alas, I am both economically and artistically challenged. how very depressing. haha.

I had BASICOM today, you will not beleive how incredibly boring that subject is. Its like 3563 times + infinity more boring than the most boring thing on earth. Ms. Donna, if you read this, please ignore it.. you know i love your subject. haha :)

I don't have class tomorrow! so if anyone out there has noone to hang out with, I am free.. as long as it does not involve sports, running, killing and peverted fantasies."

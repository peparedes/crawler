"event","It's hard to believe, but it's been almost 2 years since I've posted here. You'd think I'd have something interesting to report, after all this time, right?

Yeah, right.  

My existence is just as pathetic as ever:  My job sucks, and I still dread waking up almost every morning.  My love life is non-existent.  My investments have gone to shit.   

And, worst of all, it's starting to get cold out!   If if ever move to a new place, remind me to get one that doesn't have forced air heat.  Forced air heat is complete and total shit.  The ""forced"" air barely makes it to the second floor, where I spend most of my pathetic time.

I think I need a vacation from all this boredom.  Where should I go?"

"event","So my new job seems fine.. The people are nice, the work is more interesting. Horray! Hopefully it keeps up...

Leaving the last place was definitely the right decision (LOL.)

I am saving over an hour a day in commuting time. I feel so much less tired, from just not having to deal with all that driving. Not to mention I rid myself of a bunch of other annoyance factors related to the working environment itself. Unfortunately, I still have not received my vacation pay. I inquired, and apparently there was some type of mix up, and I should be receiving it next Friday."

"event","Over the past week, I decided I was finally quitting and taking a new job.   I will suffer no more, and am moving on to something new.

Today, I handed in my resignation.  I was extremely nervous about it all weekend, though when I actually went ahead with it, it wasn't that bad! 

I am supposed to think about what would make me happy and want to stay. Apparently, I am expected to ""come to my senses"" and change my mind shortly. I have spent months thinking this over, and I am NOT changing my mind.

Unfortunately, the next couple of weeks will be difficult, as numerous uncomfortable meetings await.  The hardest part is done, so all I have to do is wait things out, and I will be free. Horray!"

"event","I haven't posted in a month. So what has been happening in my life? Nothing much.

Physically, I can't stand going to work these days.

I dread waking up in the morning. Some days I hate it so much, that I hit the snooze button 3 or 4 times.

The commute makes me ill. 

The sight of my desk, with its piles of useless papers (crap I care so little about that I am too lazy to even throw out!), makes me want to vomit. 

Usually I show up late, because I have such a problem getting there.  Today, I was a half hour late, because I woke up late and then had to stop for a frapuccino. Everyone has their priorities, and right now mine consist of lots of sleep and occasional caffeine highs. 

This should not be. How can this go on for much longer?

The answer is, it cannot. This cycle must stop.  I must find another job, and do so immediately, for my own sanity. The only reason I have not left already is because I don't like to disrupt my otherwise boring (but rather stable!) existence.  The potential for disruption creates a large amount of stress, the kind I can literally feel in my stomach.  

I don't want to deal with the awkward meetings that will result (of which there will be many!)  I truly do like some of the people there, and I don't want to ""fail"" them by leaving. However, if I continue this, I will fail myself, which is far more important.

Sometimes, I doubt myself. Is it really that bad? Perhaps it's me and not them... It's not like I'm working in a coal mine or something. 

Anyway... I am going to contact the people who offered my a job last month. I told them I wanted to hold off for a bit. (I must've been crazy that day...) It seemed like an interesting place and was much closer to my home."

"event","So over the past couple days, I had the unfortunate experience of being on travel for work.   This often involves going out to dinner with people you don't know, and pretending you're enjoying yourself.  Usually, I just sit there, laugh occasionally, and mutter a few useless phrases, cause, quite frankly, I am just trying to make it through the misery without a total mental collapse. 

On Thursday night, I am told we are having dinner at a steakhouse with some people from another company. Keep in mind, I don't eat steak.  Infact, I haven't eaten steak in approximately 14 years.. I wasn't pleased, but figured I'd go to the salad bar. (It was actually quite good.)

Anyways, I met these three guys, who decided to bring their own alcohol, since the restaurant didn't serve any. This consisted of 3 large bottles of wine and 2 six packs.  I thought this was nice, until I discovered that the wine tasted pretty crappy, which annoyed me.  Of course, I was annoyed by having been there in the first place. This most ridiculous thing was one of the guys pretending he didn't know how to use a corkscrew.  That would've been funny - if he wasn't already acting like a drunk.

These guys started drinking, though, as previously mentioned, I suspected at least one of them was already drunk when he arrived. I have never heard such rude, disgusting, and outright juvenile conversation at a business dinner.   One guy was making a joke about abortion (okay, that would've been funny enough!), but told us, in all seriousness, that he did not actually believe in abortion.  (There were 2 women present.)  Also, there were plenty of gay jokes. Most of them started when the waiter brought out some sausage.  Basically, it was humor that would have been appropriate for a 15 year old, not an alleged 50 year old ""director"". LOL.

The next day was too boring to describe.

I finally arrived home at 9 last night, where I was able to watch BSG, and go to sleep early, cause I felt like crap.

Now I'm up early, cause I got too much sleep... ugh.. ahahahahaha"

"event","There only one thing worse than being bored at work. That's not being bored, but working on something you believe is completely pointless, a waste of time, or doomed to failure.

Yeah, so I'm pretty cynical.

The fact is, I've had this happen so many times I've lost count... The cynicism is more than justified.

I don't know how people go on like this for 30 or 40 years."

"event","I find that I am most happy when I'm doing absolutely nothing.

Today, for example, I took the day off from work. We didn't actually have it as an official holiday, but seeing I have over 200 vacation hours, I figured why not.

Somehow, I managed to keep myself entertained all day long.  I left the house for all of a half hour to go get lunch around the corner.

Pathetic, isn't it?

Oh well. Back to work tomorrow."

"event","Recently, I have been performing some self-analysis, trying to determine what, infact, is actually wrong with me.  

Procrastination is one of my main problems.  It causes some activities to take weeks, months, and in some cases, even years... (never?) These activities range from the simple to the complex... with no rhyme nor reason. Look how long it took me to bother to post to this journal, for example.

Another recent example is getting my car repaired. You'd think I'd just call up and schedule an appointment. However, there is some type of mental block that causes me not to want to bother. Perhaps it was an unpleasant experience with the car dealer in the past. Additionally, I dislike using the phone, in general, so I kept putting it off.  (I did finally call today, by the way, as the brake light came on a couple of times, and I didn't want to wind up in a situation that could threaten my safety in some permanent, unrecoverable way.)

A slightly more complex example is refinancing my mortgage.  When rates were low, I investigated this at least 2 or 3 times over a period of years. Unfortunately, it required a large amount of paperwork, as well as requesting insurance information from the condo association.  I really hate filling out forms and dealing with bureaucratic crap like that, so I did not bother. I once actually did start filling one out, then I investigated the mortgage broker online, only to discover there were many complaints against the particular individual who had contacted me. Then the guy kept calling me every day, bothering me for my information, further increasing my annoyance level. Add to the fact that I'd have to pay several thousand dollars, and it was just not worth the inconvenience to me.

During one of my many trips to Barnes and Noble, I actually bought a book on overcoming procrastination. Yes, I was so bored, I wandered into the self-help section.  Sad, isn't it?  Not that it did much good, because I've been procrastinating about reading it...

Well, until next time... where we will explore one of my many other issues. Should it be the boredom? Mild depression? Social anxiety / awkwardness? Not knowing what to do with myself? Please, dear readers (all 3(?) of you), let me know what you would prefer.."

"event","So today, I'm working with Barney again.  He mentions that he got a second job, at night. Apparently, he'll be teaching a continuing-education class at a local college, for people who want to get certified in computer repair, setting up networks, and stuff like that.

He tells me he teaches it two nights per week, and is getting paid $250 a night for 3 hours of work.

""I don't give any homework, and I don't make em take any tests"", he tells me.

""The kids love me.""

Quality. 

At least it supports my belief that technology certifications are worthless.

I have taken to calling him ""The Professor"" in AIM chats."

"event","So I'm going to post another entry...

This one is about one of the creatures at my work. We'll call this one ""Barney"", because, well, it's fairly close to his nickname.

Barney is incompetent. He also has one of the worst Rhode Island accents I have ever experienced, at least in a professional environment.   He really just doesn't know what he's doing, and is at least 15+ years older than me.  Basically, I think he had too much alcohol in his youth, and didn't have any brain cells to spare, and the effects are finally catching up with him. He also types REALLY slow.

I'm not going to get into specifics, so let's just say that I'm constantly fixing problems with his work. This goes back about a year or more... more like 2 or 3 years.  The guy is basically like a small helpless child in his 40's. Other people bitch and complain about him, too, so it's not like I have the problem. (Well, I do have problems - many of them... and they will be discussed at another time.)

Everytime he walks into my office, I want to vomit all over my desk.  

Horray."

"event","Well, hello there!

You know, I've had this account for like 4 or 5 years, and never bothered to post an entry. Why? Because I find my life so boring, I can't imagine anyone would ever want to read about it. Originally, I was going to put up a journal on my own web server, but figured I'd be bitching about my job, and that wouldn't exactly be good for my anonymity.

Anyways, I'm a somewhat geeky guy from the Providence, RI area. I spend most of my freetime hanging around, dining out, browsing the web, complaining about my normal job, and working on side jobs that I find rather uninteresting.  My favorite activity is probably going out to eat, especially Thai and Indian food.  I alternate between being totally lazy/unmotivated, and extremely ambitious/driven.  

To give you an idea of a typical weekend, last Saturday I spent over 3 hours hanging out in Barnes and Noble, drinking an Italian soda and researching franchise opportunities.  Sadly, I do this same sort of thing pretty much every Saturday afternoon. This type of activity has been going on for years... years.

I doubt I'll bother posting again, but we'll see."

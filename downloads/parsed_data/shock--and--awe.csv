"event","Ok we are busy little bees.

We are recording all our songs.  I am actually set to go in and lay down vocals on Thursday.  When you guys hear the new song, <i>Demolition Strut</i>, you are going to have an arena rock orgasm.

We're juggling things and hatching some evil plans to remedy the lack of a bass player thing.

We've registered a domain name and we're having a web site designed for us.  Hopefully soon we'll have a killer logo too so we can start harassing you about buying merch.  That's be a dream come true.  I've always wanted to have buttons for my band that I didn't have to make myself.  Ghetto.

We're making progress and soon (hopefully) we'll have some shows booked.

"event","The bad news is that Jimmie's Chicken Shack canceled.

The good news is the we and (I believe) 4 other bands are still playing.  

It's $30 to get in, and I know that's a bit steep.  But it is to see 5 band and I know that at least Shock & Awe and Johnny Giovanni & The Zombie Pit Crew will bring all kinds of rock.  It's a Pre-Spring Break party and it's going from 8pm to 4am.  They have confirmed that 120 have bought tickets so far.  So with lost of people, lots of music, and lots of booze I'm thinking it might be worth the $30.

I think it's going to be a really fun night so I hope to see a bunch of Shock & Awe groupies there.  A few of you have been asking me for directions but the best thing I can tell you is to just Map Quest it.  That's all I'm doing.  

The place is called The Fiesta Cancun and their address is:

90 south liberty drive
Stony Point, NY 10980 

Just plug that into Map Quest and you should be all set.  If you still need help just drop me a line and I'll try to help.

The show must go on.

Come watch us rock.  Then we'll all get drunk together.

"event","The show at Purchase was AMAZING!  The Student Center was packed and it was such a rush to see people in the front row singing along!  A big thanks to everyone who came and brought friends.  If played and got everyone out of their seats (who the hell sits at a rock show anyway?!?!?!).  The Animit was scheduled to play with us.  And they did.  Kind of.  They are going through a line up change and will soon be changing their name to Broken Symmetry.  It wasn't the same Animit but they still rocked the house.  Maybe even more so than usual despite a technical difficulty near the end.  And a big thanks to Paris Avenue, which was a last minute addition to the bill.  They wrapped up the night quit nicely.  The rock was certainly brought.

All that being said...

We're now in the market for a new bass player.  It's simply a case of the whole ""creative differences"" thing.  There are no hard feelings involved.  The band is going to continue playing shows, bass-less if need be.  We have a couple volunteers for temporary subs, but we're looking for someone who can go full time with us.  If you're interested then leave us a message here or on our MySpace profile if you want it to be more private.  All is well and we're not stopping for anything, so fear not.

I should have some pictures from the show in the relatively near future.  I should also have some new show dates up around the same time.  We're passing out our 2 song demo like a creepy old guy does with candy.  If you want to get your hands on the goods (and I mean the CD) then let me know.  Or just go to http://www.myspace.com/shockawe and download them for yourself.  Yes, download and burn them.  Be good little minions and pass it out to all your friends.  

Cory's working on music videos for the songs comprised of live footage.  More goodies for you to enjoy.

I think that's all the news and teasers for now.  Hope t see you at the next show (whenever and where ever that may be).

Rock on.

Jake's going to Hawaii and Dave's in Florida.  Those lucky bastards.  We're going to all regroup and start writing and practicing again in January.

2004 ended up being a good year for us...the end of it anyway.

I'm sure you've all read Jake's riveting account of our first show.  It was all that and more.  Much more, thankfully.

Since then we've polished up the songs a bit and worked on our cover of ""Pour Some Sugar On Me.""  The rock that will be brought by that one will be of catastrophic proportions.  We're working on booking a show at the Student Center at Purchase, Manhattanville, and hopefully the surrounding areas ASAP.  

We're looking forward to working on music again.  I can't speak for the guys, but I can say the being home for the holidays is killing a little piece of my soul everyday.  Upstate NY = Shallow end of the gene pool.  If you're from this area I'm sure you're not offended by that statement.  Unless you are offended by truthful statements.

I have been making VCDs of our first show.  If you're interested in getting a copy then you should get a hold of me.  It's the closest thing to a recording that we're going to have for probably another couple months.

I'll be posting photos from our first show at some point.  Keep your pants on.

I'm writing lots of new stuff.  
Thanks for a great 2004.
You'll be hearing a lot more from us in 2005.  Whether you like it or not.

Have a great new year.

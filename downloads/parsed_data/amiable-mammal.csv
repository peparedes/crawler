"event","So Scarlett Johannsen (ScarJo, LOL) has done a cover of Last Goodbye by Jeff Buckley. 

Which is a shame. It's a lovely song, and I really like her voice, but it's.... missing something. 

Maybe the original tune, or the original actaves of the notes... I dunno, it sounds empty and is a shadow of the former song. Perhaps some more production would have saved it, but as it is: Meh."

A tard, that's who.

YEP, THAT'S MY VOTE. TARDINATION AND CAPITALS ALL ROUND.

What's the problem? 

Well, let's see, while I can have a range of sizes from fairly small to tall, the range of weight (or BMI&nbsp;or chubbiness or whatever) goes from 'ridiculously thin' to 'middling'.

I am curvier than this.

In order to make my body even vaguely comparable to the size of my enormous bobble head I have to amp up my fattitude to the highest, and quite frankly it's not fat enough. I want more.&nbsp;I want to be bigger. I want my avatar to compare to my actual body, which means having my head be small compared to my fairly large body.&nbsp;I am a whole lotta woman, and I am proud to be my size, which is fairly fat. It doesn't mean I am smelly, lazy or unhealthy, it's just a signifier which describes how much adipose tissue is evident on my frame. And it's more than my XBox Live avatar allows.

Seriously guys, who thought that was a good idea.
Way to perpetuate the idea that women should *want* to (nay, nay, *should*) try to appear as much like a bag of antlers as possible... way to perpetuate unrealistic 'ideals' and the idea that beauty, or at the very least, acceptable public appearance, is based in the skinny category.

If you're skinny, more power to ya, but seriously, what happened to more power to us curvy girls? On XBox&nbsp;Live at least..."

"event","Over here in the UK I've been keeping a fairly close watch on the American Election: in a way that is wholly uncharacteristic of me. Last time all this business happened I was in University and barely knew what was going on in the world outside of my books and some serious illnesses I was suffering from at the time... I've read back on what occurred and still have a hard time believing that such ridiculous cheating was allowed on something so very, very big. This time is different. And I think it's because I had something to believe in. I'm not American but I found myself believing that his Election was important, possibly a momentous, history changing fulcrum point. Things could be better if it all went well. The world, the fucking WORLD, might change as a result of this. <br /><br />So for weeks I've been paying attention to the news, reading opinion polls and policies and watching the debates from teh intarweb. I've been interested, even passionate. I got my own idea of who I wanted to win, and it was Obama. i was glad when Obama won the candidacy but quickly, subconsciously, resigned myself to the sad knowledge and grief that while he'd fight the good fight, be intelligent and eloquent, have good policies and be the lawful good counterpart to McCain's lawful evil, he'd lose <em>anyway </em>to 'that gurning twat'. <br /><br />While I hoped against hope I'd be wrong, some large part of me believed that&nbsp;McCain would win anyway. Even though I didn't want it to happen my idealist went and sat and cried in the corner while my realist kicked them in the stomach screaming about how Americans are racist, fascist idiots who elected George Bush and sure as hell weren't going to put someone as intelligent, educated and (let's not mince words here) black as Barack Obama in the Whitehouse.. I accepted that I shouldn't get as excited about what might happen as I could feel myself getting, I was just setting myself up for the fall. The good guys would lose to the bad guys, because remember, they said if they couldn't win it properly they'd fight dirty. They'd cheat, just like I truly believe happened with&nbsp;Bush and Gore last time.&nbsp; I truly believed that most Americans would chose the dumb, angry, face-pulling doddery old whack job over the calm, educated, eloquent gentleman I saw in Barack Obama.<br /><br />In general I&nbsp;had no faith in America, in Americans.<br /><br />I&nbsp;truly believed that the millions of Americans who'd be voting would let themselves down and with that the whole world. I thought that people would fall for the name calling, the terror baiting, the dirty, shitty, childish tactics of the Republicans on this one and the Democrats, who went around acting like adults and making sense would be pushed to the back burner in lieu of the spectacle of hate the Republicans were putting on. <br /><br />Late last night, six hours ahead of America,&nbsp; it was already very late when the polls started closing.&nbsp;We were already tired, and as the witching hour slowly transitioned into the earlly hours of the morning we sat and watched the BBC website map of the US update periodically, blue pinpricks and red splotches smearing all over her hull. Eventually we got tired of watching Star Trek : The Next Generation (boy Season 3 has a weak start) in order to pass the time and accepted that we were never physically going to be able to stay up all night to watch the unseen hand carefully colour inside the lines of the state map. American politics, and the American systems of doing things, are pretty nebulous things that <em>no one will explain properly</em>, until after the fact that is. I knew last night that the Presidency was decided by Electoral College votes, not the popular vote but I wasn't (and to an extent still am not) crystal clear on what that meant even having read up on it. Either way I understood that Obama needed 270 or above to win. When we turned it it was 2.30 or so and the total stood at 103 to Obama and 48 or so to McCain...&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;slept badly. Possibly the worst night's sleep I've had, uh, ever actually. Because I was stressed I&nbsp;had nightmares, and our cats raged around the house making noise and fighting.<br /><br />I&nbsp;awoke at 6.30 this morning, bolt upright, got straight onto the computer to check the map.<br />Which was predominantly red.<br /><br />Aww, fuck. I&nbsp;thought, I so didn't want to be right, I&nbsp;so wanted to be wrong, I&nbsp;so wanted America not to simultaneously dissapoint me and confirm what I&nbsp;thought I&nbsp;knew.<br /><br />Then I checked the numbers. Obama won? Checking the main site showed that he'd made an acceptance speech!? It was all over, but they were still counting, was this some odd American way of doing things, like calling trousers 'pants' or eating 'biscuits and gravy' or spelling colour 'color' :) ***<br /><br />Nope, seems that even though they were still counting some votes the actual Election had already been won - just the way it works, I figured.<br /><br />So...Barack Obama was to be the new President of the United States.<br /><br />I wept.. For a long time.<br /><br />I'd been wrong. SO wrong. And I was <em>so very glad.</em> So very happy that Obama won, so pleased that the foregone conclusion I'd foreseen was way off. So pleased that America wasn't the place it was just a few years ago, or in my estimation, just a few hours ago before the map was shaded..<br /><br />I crept back to bed and told my husband the news before going back to sleep.<br /><br />This morning when we got up we watched the acceptance speeches of both candidates, and I&nbsp;couldn't help but notice a few differences. Of course there's a winner and a loser and McCain's speech wasn't that bad, it was the first good play I've seen him make all Election, but. I couldn't help but notice the following:<br /><br />Obama's crowd were emotional, happy and diverse. The only thing they chanted was 'Yes, we can!' a message of hope and unity. When Obama spoke of McCain there were no jeers or boos and people's attitude to McCain, (watchng the faces in the crowd) was that of polite indifference, they clapped his efforts, the crowd were united in building a better (burger?)&nbsp; America and Obama's speech spoke of how this was thie first step on a long road to be travelled together to make things better... Just the kinds of things that should happen at the victor's party. Nobody likes a sore winner, nobody likes those who gloat or reiterate how much they powned the other party and Obama's message was gracious, emotional and positive. It was about uniting the diverse peoples of the United States and bringing about change. Something America has sorely needed for the longest time. <br /><br />McCain's had a different vibe. McCain's crowd were painfully white and cruel looking, shouting like hooligans and when&nbsp;Obama's name was mentioned there was booing, hissing and jeering, the speech was regularly interrupted by idolistic 'We love John, and John McCain' chants, which just showed how they'd all missed the point that this whiole thing wasn't about one man but a whole nation.&nbsp; And while McCain's 'Aw, fuck it I guess I&nbsp;lost' speech was fairly sensible and even gracious, it was all a bit 'Me, me, me!' rather than 'Us, us, us!' for my liking. The crowd seemed more into worshipping the man, the idol himself, rather than his attitudes and what would have made him a good leader for a nation..<br /><br /> But the thing that struck me most about all of it, the most striking difference between the two parties and the two crowds of people at the speeches: when Obama talked of unity, of pulling together, of how he may not have won everyone's votes but he'd be President to the Republicans too, and how he valued their opinions and the different views they brought forth -&nbsp; the crowd nodded, smiled and cheered. When McCain spoke of unity, and of pulling together and, despite his having lost, how Republicans should support Obama as President to make a better America for everyone - there was a silence.<br /><br />It saddens me that there are thousands of people out there who will so willingly hate from their gut, will boo and deride, will refuse to comply with the best course of action despite having lost (i.e pulling together) who will so willingly, and pettily separate themselves from others because they don't agree on every little thing.... but what really affects me, what makes me so damn glad, is that I thought those people were in the majority I thought that America as a whole would vote like those people I just described, and as such McCain would win and it'd be a Fascist W. War again... and I was wrong.<br /><br />Well done America, I'm proud of you. Please feel free to thumb your nose at my low expectations of your people and dance around with your 'pants' on eating biscuits and gravy and talking about the 'color' of the sky. Feel free to be a nation of people who democratically make a choice and make foolish fools of tomfoolery like me feel so stupid for underestimating you, for judging you in the way I've just derided, for making me feel very small and very foolish and making me reevaluate the way I view the world.<br /><br />Thank you so much for taking the next step to a better world, not the step towards hate and lies and malice that you could have taken. Well fucking done.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />*** Supposed to be intentionally silly, satirical and 'Britishy'.<br /><br /><br /><br />"

I found out from her that I have a holiday entitlement of a few days so I *can* go to Ed and Linney's wedding which is at the end of March. They are looking to get the contract to me for the end of the week and my prospective start date is the 22nd. I, of course, would have liked it to be sooner but them's the brakes...

This is such good news, it means, even if I only get the three months, I'll have industry experience, a foot in the door! It also means that over those three months we'll have extra money so we can actually pay off some of our debts! I am so goddamn hopeful, I wanted this so badly, I am so exceedingly pleased, like Mr Kipling is with his cakes!"

"event","Oh everyone, I'm feeling right Christmassy.

Today I put up our tree and decorated it, while listening to Christmas Music.
There was also the baking of mince pies and the singing of Yuletide songs.

Man, my mince pies are great. They are to the Weightwatchers recipe which means they use filo pastry instead of the lard pastry that is usually used. It makes for a pie which is soft and layered at the bottom but crunchy and crisp at the top, with *just* the perfect amount of mince in them to be tasty, and dusted with icing sugar they are heavenly. I never used to like mince pies, but I like these - it must have been the lard pastry that stopped me, as the mince itself isn't necessarily offensive. Woot, all hail acquired tastes.

Later, after we've been to the gym, I plan on mulling some white wine (I can't abide red) and having a cosy tipple while my cats doughnut to their hearts' content. I've already had to use my Teacher Voice many times on Cosmos today, to stop him from poofing the decorations off the tree, but now he seems quite content to scratch at his Xmas tree shaped scratching pad and stare longingly at the decorations. I'm positive that as soon as we're out later he'll be enjoying the guilty pleasures of attacking the tree but such is life I guess.

Man, I love it when Christmas creeps up and bites me on the ass."

And it was all good, since I last ate Qburgers they're massively improved the recipe, it used to taste slightly too tangy and artificial... none of that now.

I have decided that I have determination. Rather than hoping and praying that I'm going to keep to my regime of exercise and healthy low fat eating I've decided that determination is going to get me through. Though in many ways I lack any amount of self discipline I can be remarkably stubborn when I want to be. So there.

This morning.... mmmmm bran flakes and milk. Let's see if Astrid can knock my milk over everywhere again by trying to jam her head into the glass. She gets these crazy MilkFreak eyes when milk is near, black as coals and deep as the ocean... it's quite disturbing."

We just went to see X Men 3.
I want to hit things. And cry. 
I want to scream. And cry.
I just ate McDonalds, while almost crying with anger. 
It just made me feel angry and dirty.
Like the movie made me feel too.
Walking through town to buy junk food, I made a point of saying to passers by 'Don't go to see X Men 3'. I'm so pissed off.
I feel like I did when I first saw  The Phantom Menace.
Right now I want to personally hunt down whomever approved the script and storyline of X Men 3 and slap them hard in the face. And I'm a pacifist.

<lj-cut text=""BIG SPOILERS HERE... and more anger. I'm gonna pull this fucker to shreds. If you don't want to know what happens don't read it."">

Bluntly put it was rubbish.
I hated it.
So yeah, the whole film was like an exercise in pushing established (good) characters to the side, or completely changing who they are so they make no sense any more or making them entirely redundant, and trying to make us care about non established characters by basing the main scenes in the film around them.

From the trailers I got the impression that the dude from 6 feet under, Angel was going to, y'know, be *in* the movie. Like at all. He had about 8 lines. Most of which were in one scene. They just threw him away. It was such a waste of a good actor.

The basic story is that They have found a cure for the mutant gene. Oh, and Famke J's tits. Or squinty eyes. I'm not sure which I was supposed to pay most attention to. 

Remember last movie, where they caught Mystique? She's currently a prisoner. Magneto rounds up some one trick ponies from a clamouring mob of mutants all pissed offa bout the prospect of this cure and tracks her down, saving her, she gets cured and he discards her. In the process he acquires some One Trick Ponies, unfortunately including Vinnie Jones' head CG'd onto someone else's body. Tsk. Magneto decides that the best thing to do is take his band of one trick ponies and raise an army of Goths and go kill the kid they based the cure on. Ya, rly. Basically all of his minions look like unwashed teens who dyed their towels black so that they wouldn't stain from hair dye. So, he goes to attack the lab.

Meanwhile, Jean reappears, kills Cyclops, cos, er she can (?, off he goes) and then goes to the X Mansion. There we discover that there's this never mentioned before other personality within Jean Grey that Prof X made to suppress her Mighty Powers (what?). He built a wall within her Moind so she wouldn't Destroy the Vurrrld.

This other person, her id, (because remember, she can't be powerful without being a Whore,) wants to destroy everything. She escapes and goes back to her parents' house. Where Prof X and Magneto both go to get her on side. She promptly kills Professor X in a lameass way and teams us with Malcolm X. I mean, Magneto, definitely not Malcolm X because the person who wrote this really didn't get the metaphor. For the rest of the movie she stands around looking pretty and saying absolutely nothing.

So. There's a cure, based on some mutant kid who can Leech powers. The son of head dude at the lab that made this (which is, incidentally and pointlessly, on Alcatraz, ALcatraz) happens to be Angel. He's been strapping his wings down for years and gets talked into taking the cure becauese Pappy can't love his son unless he's normal. He decides at the last minute that he doesn't want it, and we get a nice long shot of his pretty abs. He flies off and appears at the X Mansion. Where he will do absolutely nothing for the rest of the movie of any real importance to the plot.

Cut to a fucking pointless love story between Ice Man and Kitty Pride (hold on, I thought we already had a Jubilee substitute in the shape of Rogue - nope it's alright, she's A Bit Fat now so she won't be in the movie at all). Rogue gets all upset and goes to join the line of mutants who are beggin for the cure. Her reasoning. She wants cock. Yep, she's willing to give it all up, and not be in the movie because she wants some sweet lovin' from Ice Man. I mean, I guess I understand her point, what chance does she have now she's A Bit Fat and Kitty looks mighty fine in her costume. SO off she goes.

But it's ok, it's the Wolverine show. The X Men. Well, I say X Men but I actually mean Wolverine and Storm, both established characters, they go off to the big fight with four not really established characters that we don't care about: Ice Man, Kitty Pride, Colossus and Beast. Did  I mention Beast? Yeah, he's like a politician, and he acts like he's got make up on his hands and pretty much isn't given any of his characteristics - y'know, he's supposed to be clever and stuff.

Then there's a long scene where Magneto rather pointlessly moves a Big Bridge to transport his mob of goths to Alcatraz. Alcatraz. I mean, there are only about fifty of them, why didn't he just put them in a van. Not as 'exciting'. Start gearing up for the big squeeze.

Anyway, cue a big fight where Pyro turns out to be The Human Torch...

Hold it, since when has Pyro been the human torch? I thought he could manipulate fire, like in the previous movies when someone who had actually read the comics wrote it... anyway...
 
...and the soldiers defending the base have plastic guns (cos Magneto can control metal) firing plastic syringes containing the cure. Forget the fact that he has electromagnetic powers and the first movie denoument was based on this, forget the fact that basically he could still control whatever electric crap is in thoose guns to fire them because there's no way that a plastic gun with a plastic spring in in which is essentially a catapult could make a plastic syringe penetrate leather... ahem. ANyway. SO there's a big pointless fight where Magneto gets cured and the Ice Man and Pyro have a big masturbation battle/mind fight like at the end of Dark City. Y'know, where there're like streams of fire and ice meeting in the middle and, ooh who will win. Well, Ice Man actually, because he turns to Ice in an unprecedented and uninteresting waste of special effects. Not the 'haHA!' moment we really hoped for. Anywhoo. Unestablished Juggernaut goes to kill the kid in a face off between him and Kitty Pride, also not established enough for us to care... they save the kid and uh... what happens then.

Oh yeah! Evil Willow gets saved by Xander saying he loves her. I.e. Jean Grey who is randomly Detroying the Vurrrld gets Wolverine to say he loves her, she decides to be nice now and ask him to kill her, like she did at the start and this time he obliges. See, at the start, instead of killing her like she asked, he wants to have sex with her. All of that pointless crap could have been avoided if he hadn't wanted sweet lovin' so much.

And so it ends, Rogue gets cured, happy clappy Storm is now in charge of the School and Magneto still sort of has a bit of his powers.

Oh yeah, and Professor X isn't dead, but you have to wait right til the end of the credits for that rather predictable stunt.

I feel cheated.

So yeah. Let's start with who they kill, or 'kill' by making them redundant.
Cyclops.
Professor X (but not really)
Jean Grey/Phoenix.
Rogue.
Magneto.
And a whole band o goths we didn't really care about.

Overall, minus ten out of ten. Why? Because he being an alien goddess would have been better and they just pissed it all away. If I'd been the actor playing cyclops I would have asked to be killed at the start too, just so I didn't have to be in it.

I feel a bit less angry now. But only a bit.

The Da Vinci Code.
Meh... exactly what part of the movie was a code to do with Da Vinci?
Meh. 
FULL of plotholes. 
Y'know, we don't actually have Jesus' DNA.
I mean, the movie wasn't even saved by Audrey Tautou being sexy, because she looks like an old HagLady with long hair. 
What a bringdown.

On the upside, I *do* want to see The Break Up with Jennifer Aniston in it.
Is that wrong?
I love the chick flick, and while some are a big bag of wank others are genuinely great. We recently watched Just Like Heaven, which was really, really good. Had some nice lines and was well acted, well paced, nicely put together. A definite 4.5 stars out of five for a flick of the chick. 

Looks like we'll be going to see X Men 3 tomorrow.

"event","The gig we went to was okay... a bunch of bands working for free for charity... we turned up late and only caught about three of the eight or so that were playing... we saw the ass end of a really rubbish band, an entire set of Ceribus (if that's a reference to Cerberus I want to kill them for their shit spelling) who weren't bad, (put it this way, in a few years they'll actually be good) a really fucking awful punk band (missing teeth, shouty tuneless singer, disaffected looking bass player who would have been attractive if she looked like she wanted to be there, all a bit Oi in an decidedly unwashed sort of way) and a set of The Devilriders, who were good. The latter were a kind of psychobilly band, reminded me a lot of the Horrorpops (unsurprisingly)- their set was very enjoyable and I have some bruises from the pushing around I partook of; we ended up buying their EP.

Which looks fucking awful.
Their set was good but the CD cover is embarrassingly bad, if I was judging the book by its cover I would run a mile, after laughing my ass off.

Prepare yourself for my rant.

I was so embarrassed for them I decided to redo the damn thing for them and send them the file. Seriously, the cover is just going to put people off. It looks like a 5 year old did it in MS paint - not only are all the photos awful but the design is just wrong wrong wrong. The cover suffers from fontitis - too many fonts in too many colours which amount to the thing looking like someone unprofessional was trying hard to make it look as professional as possible by flexing the features of MS Word. I'm surprised they didn't put some clip art on it. Coming back to the photos, they're indescribably awful but I'll try to give you a flavour.... set in a castle or some such stony place (er, ?rockabilly?  a graveyard would have been more fitting) and badly posed. Rule one, don't pull silly faces, rule two make sure you dress for the occasion, rule three wearing the same outfits as your bandmates just makes you look like y'all lack any sense of style. Or like you're wearing your best, expensive flame shirt outfit that you have.. how original. When in a band Image Is Everything, especially if you're the kind of band where the lead singer has cool Kiss style face paint.. You have to make sure your band has a consistent look, especially for press photos. While I disagree wth wearing the same damn outfits I think every band member making an effort and creating the same sort of 'feel' to your look is very important. You would at least make sure your bass player styled his hair for the photoshoot, right? As it is the lack of effort the bass player has made for the photos makes him look like some gormless oik who works in Dixons but plays in a band at the weekend, like he's holding back their potential by a massive lack of effort. COuldn't be bothered. Their logo on the back is in a white box... which looks incongruous when the rest of the cover is black, on the front it has been badly resized so the smooth lines of the letters have gone all low res and spiky. Sigh. Inside the pictures of the band have been stretched horizontally, not vertically so they're all squished, and the billion credits and thank you's inside which dominate the cover (credits should always be small) are really low res so the font is sort of fuzzy. Oh, and on a white background. I say again WHY? WHen the rest of the cover is black. It doesn't help that the name of the EP can only be found on the CD itself, but nowehere on the cover...

SO I got all pissed off and redesigned the damn thing. It just isn't fair to them to have such a bloody awful EP inlay when the band themselves were pretty damn good.
I have yet to send it."

'Oh, are you still an alcoholic? You've lost a lot of weight!' 'PLease don't try to kiss me again this year, I'm married.' 'By sweet Baby G she looks a fucking mess....'

"event","Has a silver lining, or so they say.

However, I am one of those people who just never got that, it never rang true for me. Until today.

Remember I told you about moving into the Fat Bitch's house and subsequently moving out five days later? Remember I told you we moved because we heard the Sycophant and Fat Bitch, amusingly enough, bitching about us in the bathroom which was right next to our room. Oh, and trying to use us as Cash Cows, whilst making us prisoners in our own home.

It all went sour from that point on and for months afterwards. The Fat Bitch and Sycophant being really, really immature. It got worse when someone I used to respect started hanging out exclusively with the Sycophant, even after she'd said she was disappointed in her cowardice and that she'd lost a lot of respect for her. Strangely enough that all happened when the Sycophant moved and became Resides In London Sycophant, whilst simultaneously becoming Drug Provider Sycophant and Unchallenging Company Because She's So Goddamn Dense Sycophant...all to someone who is a big fish in a very small pond, who was slowly realising her diminishing size and in need of someone to pump her up. Needless to say that the person whom I previously respected, even loved, has become a shallow, rude, even pretty stupid shadow of her former self... and because she can't see how much she's changed for the worse while everyone else can, and because she can't see that Comfortable Relationships with Sycophants aren't actually doing her any good, she'll keep on down the path to becoming just one of the billions of Sheep in the world.

Backtrack time...
When we were still friends it was M's brthday party and the Sycophant, we'll just call her Lauren shall we, gave him a book she found in a charity shop. It was one she read when she was younger and loved, M never tried to read it, I did. I found it really annoying and generally stopped about 20 pages in. 

We decided to put a load of our junk on eBay, and what sould we find? We put it up for 1 pound: it currently stands at 13.50, with 7 people watching. Turns out that it's out of print AND recommended by Neil Gaiman... how amusing. Bless him, easily pleased Gaiman.

While the damage is done and it makes me very, very sad to think about that situation sometimes, I just want to say Thanks Lauren, if you hadn't betrayed our trust, used us and tried so very hard to fuck us over we'd still like you, and probably would have wanted to keep the book that is, seemingly, going to make us a small fortune.

Well, I think I used up my bitterness quotient for the year, I guess I'd better start borrowing from next year's allowance to keep me going over Christmas :)"

I personally love the movie to bits, and the soundtrack is really lovely jazzy, big band style fun music... now, bearing in mind most music of that style makes me cringe and then go into a berserker rage (much like Coldplay's music) this is very special.

I love this soundtrack, because the movie is mostly set around Christmas time it has some lovely versions of Crimbly songs on it, and even though some of it is at the upper end of my husky range I insist on endlessly singing to it... so here I am, happy as a cat climbing curtains singing away... I just hope my voice lasts :D"

"event","The height of Saturday morning TV in the UK has to be Ministry of Mayhem, not only do they have a gay Doctor comedy character with a fake nose (which Mar is very partial to) they also have Spongebob Squarepants, fantastic adverts (e.g. an electronic dog which responds to being petted because he has 'touch sensors' on his head, meaning a fucking great button on his head,) AND they have Ram Ray.

Ram Ray is a simple game where viewers phone in to choose a door, labelled one to five... each door chosen is then rammed at full speed by a midget. Yeah, an achondroplastic dwarf. Thing is, four one out of the five doors are glued shut: only one door is made of suitable paper to ram through. The hilarity ensues, not when he finds the door that breaks, but when he doesn't...

This week, Ray went through the motions in a hotdog costume.

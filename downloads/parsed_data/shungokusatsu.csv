Feel free to add it: http://kaioken.livejournal.com/ The layout isn't finished quite yet and I still have to code/design the friend's page and other little things, which will be taken care of shortly.

As for this one, I'll be keeping it for archiving purposes. However, at the end of the week I'll delete everyone off the friend's list to save you <font size=1>kt</font> from the dreadful horror of an LJ ghost haunting your friend's list.

It's my birthday, and a landmark that defies the laws of all other birthdays. I didn't want anything, didn't ask for anything, demanded that I didn't get anything, and suprisingly, it worked? I just wanted to go home, I didn't want some material crap.  Spent my special day feeling melancholy about myself, my life, everything. I still feel sad.

I had hope that maybe I'd see someone I knew while I was in town. I did, but it wasn't like I expected. They gave me that look, the look they give a stranger, the look they always gave me. One in seven acknowledged me, Jeremy Snell, the youngest brother of four kids. From what I remember, the oldest, Jason, and Jeremy were laid back, whereas Justin, who was my age, and Jared were little penises in their own right.

""You're 21 today and you're drinking Slice?!"" That was entertaining.

I only go back to Sheffield to see my parents, really. It's been a year since I last lived with them on a regular basis. I also pay visits to Chris, Dave, and now Todd, while I'm in the area. I don't have faith in Dave and Chris as far as their futures go. Must be the manipulating effect of College and Society, or maybe they really are that damn pathetic. Late night video games and the internet, good once in a while for a vacation...but I'm under the impression that they do that every day, with no direction in life whatsoever.  If it werent' for my parents, I probably wouldn't even come back to Sheffield. What a waste.

That excludes Todd of course. I've already written about him though, in the past.

I attend Jamestown Business College (JBC). They have this annual program where they show kids how they should dress in a business situation...and every year they pick four candidates, two boys and two girls, which they give a ""makeover"". Unfortunately, I was one of the four.

My hair is short now. It's highlighted. I have mixed feelings about it, but most everyone else thinks I look great.  Maybe if it was a little longer, ehh. Atleast I got a free suit out of the deal. I think this is the last major event I have to take part in until the exit interviews next winter. An associate's degree in Business Administration/Information Technology. So close, yet so far.

Other than that I play World of Warcraft whenever I'm home, including some messenger dodging. Who all plays and where? I can't remember, except for Ri, who I play with every other day. I have Karmine (Level 18, Human Paladin), Myleene (Level 7, Human Warrior), and my newly created Ardel (Level 7, Night Elf Rogue).  I play on the Dragonblight server and I'm willing to play elsewhere, given we keep in touch. I tried the new PVE server that was just opened. That was insane, Night Elves EVERYWHERE. Of course where people spawn, stupidity follows. Makes me wish I played Everquest in it's prime.

I may or may not be online much this weekend, due to going home to Pennsylvania. My birthday is this sunday and I turn 21.

Sophitia, Saiyajin_Ariana, CelestStar, Ariyiana, Ariana_Samsaki, Ghetto Ri, Aday, Village Ho

All names that apply to one person. The most wonderful woman alive and by far the greatest thing to ever happen to me. No, I'm not dating her, you moron...although it may seem that way at times, I spend more time with her than any of my girlfriends combined. Their jealously of her is unrivaled, it's great. I think many a relationship has crumbled because they thought I was cheating on them with her. Haha! I've never had any feelings for Ri, then and now, atleast of that caliber. It's more like a mother/son relationship at best.

Ri is probably the closest thing I have to a best friend on the internet. I have known her since around October of 2000, when I was just a fantard of PK's identity, Bryce_Samsaki. I popped the question of being Bryce's son and PK was all for it. Moreso, I also became Ariana_Samsaki's son. The family was born, and crackheads soon followed.

She's been the sole witness of every major event in my internet life. She's watched me develop and grow, /cheer and break down, grow extremely pissed off and even entirely emotionless. We talk on a regular basis, and I've even gotten to call her a few times recently. I'm like her favorite book and she can analyze any part of me and bring it into my own understanding.

Ironically enough, she's a Cancer. I have a serious issue with Cancers. It's only a 50% love thing, at times. I like one half of them, but the other half can burn in hell. Don't understand it much but, she's different. The Cancer that isn't, haha.

I guess that's all I can really say at the moment. She's the greatest thing that has ever happened to me...well next to WoW, but we won't get into that. >D

"event","Bought the RAM as planned, only took it a step further.  If I'm going to upgrade, I should max out now rather than having to buy more later. A leap from 256MB DDR to 2GB DDR? That's going to blow my fucking mind. Should be here sometime next week.

That should remedy my issues with a few games, namely World of Warcraft, Rose, Unreal 2, Unreal Tournament 2004, and The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. I may also buy some others, as RAM has always been the problem. Doom 3? Half-Life 2? The possibilities are endless...assuming I don't fuck up the installation. There goes four paychecks. Not like I ever spend the money anyways.

New icon to match my strange fascination with Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles. Doesn't seem to match up with the me you know. The me Ri knows though begs to differ. We're both anticipating the release.

Speaking of which, I called Ri last night...which was always entertaining. Lately, all we've been doing is comparing RO with WoW. Didnt' stop when we got on the phone, either. Then her phone died. That's not what bothers me. When I called, PK answered. It always bothers me when I talk to him, if only for a simple ""Hi, is Ari there?"". Once upon a time, we were very close friends. Now I honestly couldn't give a shit about him. We're that distant now.

Gabby's hilarious, the Gabby that JBC'ers may know. The Gabby that Mike Janidlo used to fantasize about. The crazy italian.  I'm about to walk in the restroom and she's all:

""Want me to go in with you? Tell you what. I'll hold it while you whistle and flush.""

Guess that was payback for:

""What are you laughing at?"" ""Your face.""

That made my day. Now work is going to ruin it."

I'll play some RO and install it on my PC. The extra video memory should give it a little oomph. I mean, hell, it worked with UT2K4. Then maybe later I'll order an extra 256 MB RAM for the PC. I'll be fine as long as I don't enter a crowded area.

Glad I got Ri into RO. Now I have someone to play with on the 1x Server that no one in Private-land dare to touch. Rate's low, there's no @go or anything like that. But you've got to consider this, it's a hell of a lot more stable than say...CrystalRO. Haha.

Also managed to find King's Quest V (Yeah, that's right Erin), Dungeon Keeper, and Diablo: Hellfire in some thrift store. A dollar each.

Might I add, 640x480 resolution at 8-bit color (256 Colors) is fucking scary. But if I want to play KQ5, it's required. Oh the love...and I love old PC games. This one's from 1991. I used to have the NES version. XD

Been trying out Rose a bit, whenever I'm not on RO ( Serena, boredom, cRO being offline, masturbation, you know the usual). Can't say I like it a whole lot, but it is playable and freaky at best. Finally reached level 10 with my lack of determination. Fucking Jelly Beans. So anyways, I talk to the fairy, and she takes me to this new world. Time to get excited right? Wrong. Welcome to the world of Lag.

As far as RO goes, DreamRO (as far as I know) is gone. It bombed. It turned into a pile of shit. Man, I loved that server too. So now we, the Ragnarok Private Server Addicts, are currently situated at CrystalRO for the most part, I don't know about Nikki though. The rate's like 120/120/100, I think. Makes your life a little easier than the 8/8/10 of DreamRO. FINALLY made Paladin, after five or so servers of getting my ass kicked as a Crusader. Working on an Assassin (Level 80), Monk (level 53), and a Priest-to-be (Acolyte Level 45). Two days in RO time is really fucking long, I must say. If all else fails, I have my 1x server, AniRO. About as pure as it gets on Private servers. Yay!

"event","Here's the remaining thoughts on you, the public. Considering it's 9 AM and I'm still feeling like a lazy fuck I'll keep these short and sweet. Enjoi.

Mae - You shouldn't even have to ask. I spent well over a week with you, made a lot of mistakes, and came home with a monster regret. Still, that didn't change us as friends. I'm still looking forward to facing off with your Ginyu. >D

Elena - Keep it professional, you silly otaku, you. >BD

Stephy Steph Steph - You wanna be in on this huh? You're still the best thing to hit morning breath since listerine. Whatever the hell that's supposed to mean.

Jesse-kun - Since I got into RO, we really haven't talked a lot but then again you've been busy yourself.  Still, I miss talking to you.  You're freakin' awesome and you know it. Lookin' forward to being smacked around some more by Sir Riza himself.

The Gab - Still the best damn Chichi around. Even better at entertaining me with talk about Chris and other guys. Nothing beats the school dance routine. Haha.  We should RP sometime soon.

Darren - I really don't know what to say. You're rather neutral, atleast in my eyes. That's probably your best quality. I don't think you get excited easily.

Gretchen - What's up? Miss seeing you around JBC, but that can't be helped. You were awesome and did a great job of keeping me entertained in that boring accounting class. Unfortunately, I still have to take Accounting 2 before I'm done with Mrs. Gustafson. Oh hell.

Apey - Stfu. Get your boobies off my browser.

Ju-D - \o <( What's up? )  Actually, I don't know what to say to you. You do offer a different kind of flavor to the internet, something I like.

Rochelle - You still have me added? Man, I'm such a penis to you. Or I was, rather.

Lyxie - So much has happened, we've lost touch with one another...but as of late, I feel atleast a small spark of that magic returning. We can catch up on old times on RO and Rose if you want.

The Pookinns - Doesn't take a lot to get what I want out of you, be it a <3, a :-L, or simply a wtf. Your energy or lackthereof keeps me coming to LJ all the time. I enjoy fanboying you. ;D

Chris - Bro, thanks for getting me into RO. I love it. I love the community just as much, aside from the rampant drama that takes place but that's easily ignored. Speaking of ignored, sometimes I feel that way when I'm around those people, but fuck that. The Apothesis is no match for The Brotherhood. Remember, we gotta make bRO. Haha.

Donna - High.  Six years? Don't think it's been that long. Remember, you were in chat before me. I didn't meet you until mid-2000. It's nice to see that you dumped the chat side of you. Now I'm coming in touch with the real side of you, even if you still deny me the love. Haha. Buy Donna.


Enough of that, I think that's everyone. Back in College, waiting for the initial class which is about 45 minutes away. That's okay though, gives me time to catch up on what I didn't observe during my week off. You really think that if I get a chance to hang out with my friends, I'm going to blow them off for the internet? Get real. Speaking of which, you guys need to lighten up. Sure, I sent that mass messasge on Y!MSG to instigate drama, but hell, the people that flipped out were the ones that have me added on multiple messenger programs. Managed to shrink the list down to about 10 or so though. Much easier on the eyes.

As for college news, I have to attend this luncheon at some country club on a golf course. Lovely, I get to dress up yet again. It won't be much though. Can't go wrong with free food. Oh and I have tommorow off, Ri. 

I appear to be showing interest in someone. The thing is, I don't want to show interest. I don't even want to be in a damn relationship. Just my luck that I happen to be a Taurus with Cancer attributes. Damn the clingyness, damn the desire to be with someone. No, I will not feed the hunger.

I crave a digital camera. Dunno why. Must be in my blood, seeing as my Dad was really into Photography in his earlier years. Guess that's next on my list, although I don't really know what i should be looking for. All of course after I pay the $200 bill on my grandma's Visa. <3 @ 80sTees/Hot Topic

I also want this late snow to melt. I'm aching for some asphalt in the best way I know how. A la skateboard. Yum.

I took work off so I could stay home an extra few days. Great choice for everything but my wallet. After a few days off though, you begin to crave that routine that you normally hate.

Got to see my sister at last. She's in the Marines, the little squirt survived boot camp. She came to Punxutawny, Home of the Groundhog Phil, with her boyfriend (who's name escapes me at the moment). At first glance, I didn't care for the guy. Infact I secretly wanted to kill him for being around my sister<font size=1>wtfTomyounevercaredaboutanythingregardingherbeforewhystartnow</font> Oi.

I really didn't care much about him until we went bowling. Yes, you read that right. I went outside and I went bowling. Man, my thumb hurts.

Now they're back in North Carolina and I SHOULD be in NY. Should be. But instead I get another day in PA. Why? On April 3rd (yesterday, tard), it snowed. SNOWED. It's hell out there but hopefully it'll clear up for tommorow. I'm missing Comp class because of this, not that it matters. I practically sleep my way through that.

I need my hair cut. I also want my goods from 80sTees.com

Todd called me last night. For those that don't know, he was my best friend in High School, and recently I went up to visit him in Robinson, PA (near Pittsburgh). Not suprisingly, I found myself drawn into another conversation with him about Alyx. About who she is, who she was, attitude and the whole nine yards. So, naturally I gave my opinion.

Alyx is needy, selfish, obsessive, troubled, so on and so forth. She's not the girl he knew and she's damn far from the girl that I knew and possibly loved. The arrogance and other such traits of her boyfriend also rub off on her. She is easily manipulated, and often conforms to other people's attitudes. She dwells on the past far more than I ever have or will be. She submits to pressure easily. She's very close minded, and often takes anything I say or do and twists it in a manner so it'll blend in with her opinion, past and present, of you or I.

She is not Alyx Kristin Walker. She's Alyx Christopher Robichau (or however you spell it). Her insecurity bugs me.

It's easy to assume I miss her and I'm jealous of what I can't have. I fell in love with a shadow of myself or rather what I used to be...and the thought of Chris makes me sick.

She thinks she's grown up, as Todd has told me. She said ""We all have grown up"". No, Alyx hasn't grown up, and neither have I. She named other people like Teracia. I don't know what goes on in Rae's life, professional or otherwise, but I am not grown up, and she sure as hell isn't either.

I'm going to a Business College. I am still dependent.

Alyx is talking about going to an art school. She lives with her parents.

Todd has lived two years of his life independently. He graduated from high school when he was 18, whereas I did not. He graduated barely, only doing enough to get by...before attending an IT school much like I am. He slacked off. He screwed up. He is no longer in college, chased by student loans. He worked for the last year or so at a Chinese Resturaunt in the local mall's food court (which I might add was DAMN good food). The resturaunt was bought out, however, shortly after I went home. They pretty much told all the current employees, manager included, to fuck themselves. Todd's without a job, now with an eviction notice from his apartment. He has 10 days.

Is Todd a deadbeat? A loser? A reject?

Fuck no. He may not have the best future in the world right now, but he's doing what he wants to do...and he's doing it without using anyone else as a crutch. He has roommates yes, but they certainly aren't his parents. To me, that's courage. Todd is known for less than bright decisions. College or not, he KNOWS what he wants to do, and is taking the steps to reach that goal one day at a time. In the last couple years he's become a fluent speaker in Spanish, and holds slight knowledge of Portugeuse and Chinese. He wants to work with people. Translation interests him.

He's moving to Virginia, after him and his roommate Mike Maschensic (Also from the Sheffield, PA area)have given up finding jobs and coincidentally being screwed by life and their landlord. He's been beaten, but he's not defeated. Impulsive, but he's not the type to give up.

...and remember, his parents are playing no part in this.


That phone call ended up pissing me off, although it's expected from someone like Alyx - the Alyx of today.

RO is nice. I don't have to deal with the shit from people I used to know and love. There's teenage drama, yes, seeing as I'm a few years older than the majority. That, I can handle. Assumptions and biased opinions of my true best friend, based on things said years ago? No.

That is Todd Daniel Madigan, friends. Code named: Fatt.


<i>In other news<i>

The college, Jamestown Business College, is known for not only teaching you what is needed in the college, but the little things to help you outside the courses. Apparently, they have this program, where they give the students a makeover from their current appeal to that one more appropriate in a business setting. It's required of every student, but they've chosen me to be their model student, as in the first to set an example.

....I have the feeling that I wasn't randomly selected either.

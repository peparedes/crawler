<b>Tom Cruise going to Aberdeen theater with contest winner</b>

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

ABERDEEN, Wash. -- Radio station K-B-K-W reports that actor Tom Cruise will be in Aberdeen on Tuesday for a private screening of ""Mission Impossible Three"" with a contest winner.

South Shore Mall general manager Nina Morean (ma-reen) says Paramount Pictures notified her of the local winner of the Paramount Pictures/Yahoo Peoples Premiere Sweepstakes. Cruise is to announce the winners name tonight after the New York premiere of his new action flick.

The grand prize in the online contest is a screening of ""Mission Impossible Three"" at the winner's hometown theater with Cruise.

The actor is scheduled to fly into Hoquiams Bowerman Field in a private jet Tuesday afternoon, then go to the mall theater for the private movie screening.

In other news, Tom & Jarrah have:
<li>Seen Counsin Ben & Cousin-In-Law (Is this correct?) Bethany get married
<li>Ran in to an old elementary school friend (Jarrah's) Laurie Cox & former Camp Sealth coworker ""Flame"" (Kara)
<li>Jarrah has been spending a lot of her recent days looking for work and helping her friend Melinda from her recent move BACK to the US from Norway.
<li>Tom's team @ work finally moved in to their <a href=""http://www.bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?story=weeklyupdatesept23&p=4865319"" target=""new"">new building in DT Kirkland</a>
<li>Jarrah is still holding out hope that she will get at least ONE watermellon sprout from her flowers before shes has to bring her container garden inside for the winter. The green peppers, & green beans were fantastic, and I have a single sprouting lemon (the size of a pinkie fingernail).
<li>The vining Jasmine plant has been attracting humming birds. Who would have thunk'it! The 6th floor deck of a condo building in the city can attractd 3 different hummingbirds for regular visits.
<li>R2 the A/C has offically been retired for the season.
<li>Other than that it's been a lot of movies, dinners with friends, cleaning, & developing irrational fears of our maintance man. (Seriously .. He's creepy and likes to walk around on the roof of our building above our unit.)"

As we grow up, we learn that the one person that wasn't supposed to ever let you down probably will. 

You will have yourheart broken probably more than once and it's harder
every time.

You'll break hearts too, so remember how it felt
when yours was broken. 

You'll fight with your best friend. You'll blame a new love for things an old one did. 

You'll cry because time is passing too fast, and you'll eventually lose someone you love.

So take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like you've never
been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of
happiness you'll never get back.

"event","Tom and I went to my families Lake House @ Mason Lake. It was a nice weekend away. We got in Friday night got comfortable and then late in the evening sat out on the dock and watched the meteor shower. We were so far away from the orange glow of the city lights; I haven't seen so many stars since I ran pack trips in to the Wenatchee Wilderness. We sat on the dock together, and talked quietly and listened to the water hit the dock pylons and watched streaks across the skies .. it was fantastic!

We laid around Saturday. We played with Nick in the yard, we went swimming in the lake, I dove off the dock while Tom failed miserably BUT WITH GUSTO.. we cooked steak and watch movies. Someday I'll convince my dad or Uncle Kenny to show me how to use the boat & Sea-doo..

Our nice quiet weekend got a pretty punk rock twist when it turns out it was also Harley Weekend at Ocean Shores. The was just pretty fun, we met some seriously cool people. We came back that Sunday a bit early b/c I had book club @ Tiffanys.

We spent the last weekend hanging out at home, and I got ready for my first day at my new job @ T-Mobile. Which requires its own posting. But Saturday we went bowling with V&J & T&B which was a kick and a hlf except durring the seccond game when I scored a total score of 13. The later in the week we all went and had super yummy Chinese food in Shoreline.

Wednesday Tom & I went to the Mariners game, and saw the Mariners get spanked by the Twins in 14 innings.

That and its light years better than anything in DT Seattle,  but that's not hard Meridian is a shit hole.  Anyways we went & saw The Island.  I loved it! I thought it was fantastic! 

Saturday, Tom &  I went to the king County Fair in Enumclaw. Smaller & less commercial than the state fair.  Just the right size, just the right size crowd.  The King County fair holds a soft spot in my heart, as I spent several summers there with my 4-H group showing horses.

Toms home with dinner!  To summarize the rest we also saw he Bad News Bears & did a shit load of laundry."

"event","On Friday night Tom & I saw <a href=http://www.margaretcho.com/>Margaret Cho</a> @ the Paramount. How suiting right? The Friday before gay pride weekend in Seattle? I thought I saw a couple of my friends but there were so many people I couldn't find out. The whole show Tom & I were doubled over in laughter. She's fantastic. I wasn't a big fan of the CHO Revolution, but I adore ""The Notorious C.H.O."" & ""I'm The One That I Want."" Her stories on being a ""fag hag"" and growing up Asian in America is so reminiscent of so many of my friends, it's uncanny.

So Tom & I wanted to go to the Gay Pride parade since it may be the last year it's up on Broadway, but my cold finally caught up with me this weekend.  Tom played computer game while I recovered watching HGTV. Mmm.. home makeovers. I really wanted to go support my friends who were marching, but I just couldn't get up all day. I did hear that the ""Abortion Truck"" made its annual appearance. (Those not familiar, the abortion truck is this U-haul like truck that has pictures of aborted fetuses on the side of it and drives up and down the parade route before the close off the street.

Now can I just say, I've worked in marketing and as a writer whatever happened to the line, ""Know your audience."" Do you really think that driving the abortion truck through a crowd of the most liberal people, in one of the most liberal cities in the nation is REALLY going to be effective? Seriously, this isn't your crowd. The people who are lined up early on a Sunday morning, to watch ""Dykes on Bikes"" probably aren't going to change their minds. You're going from political stance to poking a pit-bull with a stick. 

And I'm sorry but really, are the ""gays"" really the people having a shitload of abortions? I have a lot of gay/lesbian & transgender friends and I'm pretty sure abortion for themselves at least .. REALLY isn't on their immediate radar.

Anyways, if you're looking to turn hearts and mind, the fear/guilt approach try driving that truck around the people that actually have abortions; like Kentucky. Oh wait those are the people who SHOULD have abortions... Drive it around high schools in the poorer areas. Yes your truck will probably be used as a mobile target practice, but statistically speaking this is the demographic that's most likely to have an abortion. Because it's so much better for a child to be born and to live in deplorable circumstanced to teenagers who aren't ready to take care of it, only to later be turned over to the state, to then perpetuate the cycle of drugs, violence, ...and teenage pregnancies, then to not be born at all. Idiots.

How did I get on to this soapbox? Mybad.

Anyways ... I don't have to sit on a curb on a Sunday morning for my friends to know how much I love, adore and support them and their causes. It was just another punk rock weekend of entertainment, relaxing & other <i>horrible</i> liberal activates..

Nick got loose last night. We were playing off-leash in the locked parking garage and one of our neighbors opened the gate and Nick ran out. Not our neighbors fault at all, I know it's one of the risks, but untill the city of Bellevue builds me the dog park I want, it has to make due.

Why is it when Nick runs away he will walk right up to any person that's not Tom or I? Goofy.

I'm adding a new link! I have no clue why I didn't add it before. Earlier this year we set up a webcam for Nick so I can watch him while I'm at work. I was always worried that he was making noise and disturbing out neigbors but it turns out all he does it sleep. Occationally he stands up, turns around and sleeps on his otherside.

"event","Tom & I have a couple favorite restraints that we love to visit, but close to the top of that list is, <a href=http://www.buckleysseattle.com/>Buckley's on Queen Anne</a>. A cute Irish pub nestled in lower Queen Anne a couple blocks from Key Arena. It's not a sports bar but really an high class Irish pub. Have you ever heard such an oxymoron in you life? Check it out if you ever have the time. Try the cheese fries, (French fries with a little parmesan) their Chipotle Ranch is to die for. Their bacon cheeseburger is by far the best I've ever had. Hand made paddies read cheese peppered bacon .. Mmm.. try some of the ranch from the fries on it. Yum.

So we saw Cinderella Man on Friday night. The story was predictable but it had a way of making it new. You could feel for the people, it truly showed the state of America during the depression. I dunno .. I really did want to stand up and cheer for it.

Saturday & Sunday morning I had my Project Management classes. I'm trying to get my certification, as proof that I really do know WTF I'm doing. While I'm in class I enjoy being their, I love how my instructors teaches, and given the topic you think you would fall asleep during it, and I really don't have that inclination. I love it and when the class is over I really want to sit down and work on my assignments for the week. Rare to have that feeling after a class. However .. I will say that I do dread the actually going. I hate the getting up so early on my days off, which sucks ,, and that so much time of my days off in general isn't mine, but once I get there and we start I'm fine.

We went shopping Saturday afternoon. tom & I really shouldn't be allowed in the discovery channel. We buy horrible items that we're entranced with. Tom got this back massager thing and I got this fountain that has a light in it that changes color BUT WAIT THERES MORE! It also mists. Like a humidifier adding water vapor to the air my fountain makes this water vapor fog that looks like it has dry ice in it. You can add scented oils and it makes the room smell amazing. I got Grapefruit .. I sat and stared at that thing for an hour. I love it. I want to get strawberry, mango or vanilla.

That night Tom had his sleep study. I took advantage of this and went and saw ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants."" A teen estrogen filled movie that Tom would go see if I asked, but would have hated it. I actually had more of a range of emotion with this movie that I did with Cinderella Man. Cinderella Man was GREAT! However I could identify with everyone in this movie.  The been there done that of growing up female, it effing sucks. I cried real tears and snot a couple times during this movie.  When America Fererra (Carmen) talks to her dad, Bradley Whitford(Josh on the West Wing), about his new marriage and what was so wrong with her .. I was sobbing. I'm a dork.

It was odd not having him around when I was going to sleep that night. We haven't slept in apart in well over a year, trying to fall asleep .. the bed felt so empty. No reassuring warm body to flop over on to when I'm 1/2 asleep. Although I was a bit upset at first .. eventually I hogged the whole thing and spread out occupying every square inch of that matress.

Sunday morning more class .. by that afternoon life caught up with me and I fell asleep half falling off the couch until it was time to go have dinner with Tim & Brian, Van & Jiunwei. We ended up watching Red Dragon which I thought I would be okay watching. Yeah sorry still not good with the horror movies. I nearly tore Tom's left arm off when Brian's dryer went off.

An alright weekend .. I want my classes to be done with and I want a week off. I need to go get my eye brows waxed shortly .. hey ... ask Tom if you can see where the sleep tech shaved his shoulders to put on the sensor pads. They're great."

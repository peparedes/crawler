"event","<b>2006 ""Resolutions"".</b>
If you will.
Not really resolutions. More like goals. Things I'd like to accomplish this year. Things I know won't really happen, but perhaps would like to keep in mind. Just for kicks. And attempts. And hopefully, some sort of result.

<b>1. Be Healthier</b>
Eating healthier, excercising (I'd like to tone up, not really loose weight). Just in general, to live a healthy lifestyle.

<b>2. Trust More</b>
It's really difficult for me to let my guard down, and be completely comfortable around someone. But I figure, if I don't trust more people, I'll never really be living life, because I won't know what else to expect. How can I truly know people, if I'm not myself around them?

<b>3. Get back into guitar</b>
Self explanitory.

<b>4. Drive Less</b>
I'm getting sick of driving. I'd like to carpool. It's better for the enviornment anyways. This leads to my next resolution...

<b>5. Have a relationship</b>
I haven't had one in so long. I don't want to have one, just to be in a relationship, I'd like to like the person. But if I get into a relationship, the boy can drive. I think I'd be a pretty good girlfriend too...

<b>6. Overanalyize less</b>
I will never be able to tell what someone is really thinking. I'll end up driving myself crazy.

<b>7. Get better grades </b>
I'm not doing poorly now, but I know I could have done better. School is my job, so I'm going to give it my all.

<b>8. Narrow down college choices</b>
I'm going to have to do this soon. Before 2007. Becuase that's when I graduate. Eeeek.

<b>9. Spend more time with family</b>

<b>10. Be more forgiving and understanding</b>
I'm going to try really hard to see things from other's perspectives. Because I CARE. (..?)

<b>11. Listen to every song on my iPod</b>
Be ready, Barracuda.

<b>12. Have a party</b>

<b>13. Become a Big Sister (the volunteer)</b>
I have so much free time. I really want to give back to the community.

<b>14. Get a dang job.</b>
It's about time I broke into the real world. I have a job set up.. probably. Salon Foushee. I think I'd like it...

<b>15. Save money</b>
I spent so much in 2005, it's ridonkulous.

<b><big><big>16.Enjoy 2006</big></b></big>
No longer will I being participating in things I don't want to do. If I'm not interested, I'm not going to do it. Plain and simple.


I'm sorry if you read this all.
Now I must go back to wearing my new snowboard boots around the house with my sweats on."

Fritz moved out. He's living with his french teacher until Friday. After that, he's either moving in the the mormon family that he didn't like, or Aric Holmes. Apparently, he still wants to hang out with me all the time, but there's no way I'm going to pick him up all the time. Especially if he's at Aric's house. That would just be weird.

Physics is really hard shit. Oh man. I don't know why I don't understand a lot of this stuff, but man, it's kicking my ass. I really should be trying to do my homework for that now.

Tyson has an ear infection. He's had it for about 3 weeks, and we've been putting medication in, but it's not going away. Because he's half charpei, his ear canals are twisted and they might have to do surgery. Poor puppy!

So last week, I backed into Tyler Holtzinger. He drives a crappy 93 Spirit. I think it's a big piece of crap. I told him I'd pay for it though, and to just let me know how much it would cost to fix it. I guess they're trying to get me for as much as they can so he can trade his car in and get a nicer one. They want to repaint the whole car and everything. I didn't even chip his paint, I just dented the door a little bit, and honestly the car is so junky, it's not even worth fixing. But I think it's really shitty that they're doing that. I don't think it's right at all, and its complete bullshit that they're trying to get me for as much as they can. When they're TRADING THE CAR IN. When you trade a car in, of course they aren't going to give you a very high price. It's not a big deal. Asshole, I wish people got what they deserved.

Fritz. Is moving out. (Period?) Yeah, he doesn't think that he got a very good fit for a family and is moving out. That blows, cause I actually was starting to like him. All that stuff about him being kind of tolerable and was almost growing on me.. was me just trying to be tough incase he turned out like Adam in the end and pissed me off. But he's leaving. Gah. I'm actually kind of hurt. I feel like I'm just not good enough. He keeps telling me that it's not my fault, and that he'll have a really really hard time finding a host sister as cool as me, but I just can't help thinking that I did something wrong. Or I could have done something better. Maybe if I just got him to school on time..

um.. ya.. just kiddin

but it's been a while so how's about an update? sure. i only have 6 minutes though so..  well ya

school is kicking my ass. i need to get it into gear. i still have a 3.4 but it's sad that that would bring my 3.9 GPA down. i can't have that slip. i sound pathetic, but that's really all i have to get into college. which i have been thinking about nonstop cause omygosh it decides the rest of your life and holy crap i'm just not ready for that yet. but where is everyone thinking about going? i want to go to san francisco or northern california i think. i just don't know if i could be away from home/friends. or.. shit i hate this

mr branch was on the price is right today. for as much as i have started to hate that man (seeing as he has become the teacher in my lowest grade i've ever gotten ever), it was actually pretty cool. it made him slightly tolerable.

i'm loving this weather. oh man oh man i love it when it's cold. maybe cause my last name is winters, or maybe because i'm tired of the heat (i hate hot), or maybe i just want something different but man, today was nice. i love love love love <b>love</b> being cold. just the feeling of long sleeves shirts put me in heaven

fritz is now tolerable. i'm starting to like him even. it's hard that i'm constantly comparing him to adam, but i'm sure that will pass. perhaps it's because i saw him for about 10 minutes total all weekend? maybe.

My gosh, I miss people. Lately it's been jeff jeff jeff and shiiiyit son, i'm sick of it. it's weird how i can hang out with people constantly that i don't even like being around. i told him friday that the last place i wanted to go was john's. so we went to john's. he said for only 20 minutes, and we were there all night. i ended up spending the whole night listing ways to kill myself
<u>the top ways</u>
-sticking my keys into the electrical socket
-plunging to my death off john's balcony
-leaping down the stairs in the fetal positioin
-announcing that i was allergic to peanuts, then making a PB&J

I need a haircut.

I'm addicted to cracking my knuckles now. Oh, the shame, for I will never be a hand model because my knuckles will be FAT.

I got mad at Adam at the end of the year last year because he was leaving. Now, I don't like Fritz, not because of any particular reason other than he is not Adam.

I push people away because I'm afraid of relationships. Mick liked me and yes, I liked Mick, but I couldn't admit to it until Mick moved on to Caitlin. Now there's nothing left for me to do. I must find it amusing to watch myself scramble to save things or help things at the last minute. I think I do this because then it seems like I'm trying to have a relationship, but I'm the reason things fall apart in the first place. Ugh, I've just done it so many times.

I quit volleyball because I'm lazy. I tried to make excuses, but there are none to make except for the fact that I fuck things up. Regularly.

Oh man. Somehow Jeff found out I was hanging out with Mick the other day. Mick had to tell him because he asked how cuddling with Mick was. It's not like I was trying to hide it from him, but at the same time, I was. 

I'm starting to meet more people, and it's sweet! I got whistled at in the parking lot the other day too, and I got really embarassed, but I think its funny now.

Uh oh. Butterflies.

Goodnight.

P.S. My favorite quote of the day-
Nick: It smells like kool-aid in here!
Kaylee: Oh yeah?
Nick: Yeah! I had kool-aid this morning!
Kaylee: Ooo was it strawberry starfruit?! That's the best!
Nick: Yeah right strawberry starfruit. Who mixes two flavors? My favorite kind is LEMON LIME!"

Homecoming is turning out to be a nightmare. Honestly, I better have the time of my life, or I'll be pissed. I've been dress shopping 4 times, and I can't find a single one thats even remotely close to what I wanted. Jeff keeps threatening to not go with me, and even though he's kidding, that's so gay. It just... what a homo. 

School is hard. Student teachers suck ass. I think it's so dumb that my grade has to suffer because my math teacher doesn't know how to teach. She can explain things pretty well, but she doesn't explain why they work. If I have the exact same problem that she did, I'll understand, but if it's a little bit different, I'll get lost. I'm getting frusterated because usually I'm acing math with like a bajillion percent. Physics is some hard shit too. Oooo boy.

I have the worst taste ever in my mouth right now. I ate one of my mom's calcium pills. My mistake.

I don't like Jeff. Why I'm going to homecoming with someone I don't like, I don't have the slightest idea. The more he tries to hug me and cuddle with me, the further it makes me want to be from him. I just... don't like that stuff. 

I miss people. It seems like I'm always busy, but I'm never doing anything. I just miss it. I miss last year. That sucks. There's so many people I just want to hang out with. And be with.

I got my FALL OUT BOY TICKETS! Wooo! November 9th, here I come!

Fritz is slightly improving. Yes, there's still times where I want to kill him, but at least now there's times where I can tolerate him. I'm glad. I didn't want to have to kill a German boy.

That's why it's called a futon. Is so you can make it into a bed. Since I'm the only one ever fucking down there, why does it fucking matter?

The downsides to having a FES: The first two monthes, I'm stuck cleaning up after them, until my mom realizes that it isn't me who leaves watered down cereal in the basement. They leave cups in the computer room that stain the desk, and I get blamed for it. Their parents call at 7:30 in the fucking morning.

Last night my mom had me come home to clean up the kitchen cause I didn't put up my grilled cheese pan. So I did it, and then my mom pulled the ""you aren't going anywhere until you clean your room"" card. Dammit. She wouldn't let me leave after that either cause my bathroom wasn't spotless either. SHiiiit. She's lucky that watching the OC until 3 in the morning is kind of enjoyable.

I miss everyone so goddamndoucheass much. It's crazy. I think I have a date waiting for me too!... ;-) haha.

To recap the whole trip:

<u>Saturday</u>
Drove. For about 6 hours to Pendleton, Oregon. I fell asleep for about an hour, but I was boooored. But we rented a Caddy, so it was pretty comfy! I even got to learn how to use GPS and all that fancy shmancy shiyit.
<u>Sunday</u>
Drove to Seattle. Gorgeous. I love that place so much. We had dinner with my one of my mom's old friends/coworkers, Darrel. That man was probably the nicest person I've ever met. He was just.. ugh.. I wanted to hug him! Not in like, <strong>that</strong> way. He was just so nice. He took us to the biggest grocery store thing ever. Sounds lame, but it was really cool. They had <i>everything</i>.
<u>Monday</u>
Pike Place Market. It really wasn't anything special, just a tourist attraction. But these guys, they're in movies and stuff, they throw these huge fish. HUGE. I got a picture, don't worry. It was kinda cool though. And I saw a guy on the street corner. He had bells on his shoes, a thing that attaches his harmonica around his neck, and he played the guitar while hoola hooping. Theeeen, he balanced another guitar on his face while doing all that. I gave him a dollar! Then we drove up to Anacordes Island. That place was the most amazing place I've ever been in. It was right by the Puget Sound, and just beautiful.
<u>Tuesday</u>
Explored the island a little bit. We went to the beach,  but it was far too cold to get in the water. It was about 68 degrees. Perfect weather, I'd say! Around 4, we went <strong><big>WHALE WATCHING</strong></big>. By far the highlight of the trip. We went out on the Puget Sound, and saw two gray whales. My mom got all excited when they dove down and you saw their tales. It was cute. Then we went further out, and saw some orcas. There were about 8 of them, I think. They were really awesome. A couple swam right around our boat, and one went right under it! I tried to get pictures, but my camera died. It was so cool though. There's just something about seeing that kind of stuff that's so soothing and relaxing. Then we saw another gray whale on the way  back, and he came right up close to us too! It was soooo cool. 
After whale watching, we went to eat at this grill place. A bunch of people from our whale watching group were there too. My mom had a few beers, and she was kinda drunk. There was this very attractive boy that I had been ""making eyes"" with all day. He sat at the table across the aisle. I started ""making eyes"" again, but turn around to find my mom waving at him. Gah. It was like.. full out embarrassing wave. Then she went to talk to the family. I made no more eyes.
<u>Wednesday</u>
Drove to Clarkston, Washington. Boring. 13 hours in the back of the car. I was very grumpy. We got to the hotel around 9, and I went straight to the hot tub. I met some really cool people there. 4 college kids were in the hot tub too. 19,19,20,21. The 21 year old was probably the funniest person I've ever met. There was also this kid there from Canada. He was 17, but not really my type. I did kind of a bad thing though, and told them I was 17. I talked to them for about an hour, and swam some. Then we went back to their room and chilled for a while. I learned how to play Super Mario aaaall over again.It was nice to talk to them though, since the only person under 40 I had really talked to was Dreama, Darrel's granddaughter, who used to live on an Indian Reservation. (Crazy). Plus, Logan was quite an attractive boy. And nice. He helped me learn how to play. ""... face, book!""
<u>Thursday</u>
Drove to Boise, Idaho. It took 8 hours. It was only supposed to be 4. Ugh. Met some strapping young men in the hotel though. <strong>strapping</strong>. It's a really nice hotel too. Really sweet hot tub.

Andrew:Can I yell at these kids? *rolls down window*
Kaylee:Uhhhhh...
Andrew:YYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAH BITCHES!
Kayla:This is Governor's Ranch! You can't say those things!!

So anyways, I leave tomorrow, and I better hang out with all of you, bitches! Yeah, I'll only be gone for 6 days but man! I just.. I miss people! And I'll sure as hell miss civilization!

I had a really good talk with Andrew tonight. Awkward, but good. He told me that I always have to have my eye on somebody, and he's right. I hate that. Why is there a constant need for affection? Ugh. And he said that he understands that I'm lonely. Even though he was pretty drunk at this point, he made sense. ""People pair off and you think 'I want that, I want to be in a relationship' and the next question that comes up is 'Who do I want that with?' And you have all this time to think about it because all you see is happy couples."" I dunno. I liked it. Wise Andrew, wise... but from now on I'm just going with the flow. Because I feel lame talking about my feelings of lonliness online, because you're all dating anyways. I just hate the feeling of wondering what could have been, or what should have been.

I'm really tearing through my OC DVD's. Man, I freakin' love that show. Sevana and I were talkin about how our lives would make such a good Laguna Beach show. I named her hamster Justice, so everytime she feeds it she has to go ""Justice is served"" and do a sweet hand motion.

Oh, and I'm still quite mad about Juan. If I don't get an iPod back in time to go to Seattle, I'll fuckin'... shit I don't know. Fuck.. shit.. up!

Sunburns, weird old men, 3 dollar water, and 100 degree weather.

Always guarentees a good time. <strong>Always</strong>. 

Oooooohhh so today was awesome. Oh so awesome. Minus the sunburn. And the blisters. But they'll fade, and on the contrary, the memories will last. Haha. Corny. 

So there was Hawthorne Heights (I <strong>died</strong>.)The Starting Line (simply amazing). Fall Out Boy (pandemonium). Senses Fail (not as good live). Armor For Sleep. Hidden In Plain View. Gym Class Heros. Some UnderOATH. Emery. From First To Last. Holy smokes it was off the hook. <i>Off it. </i>

Talked to Mickey and my tummy hurt. Oh yeah, and I punched a kid. (I killed a man with a trident!) Ooooh those MTV punks went down. I'll teach them to invade my personal space. 

To those who will read this, you missed out. And to Kayla, even though you're at camp, thank you for going with me. 3 years and I'm not even close to stopping.

Hypocrites really bother me. Don't even bother saying how much something annoys you if you plan on doing the exact same thing later that night. Or even if you don't plan on it. What a waste of my time.

I really had a lot of fun tonight. I went to Thomas' house, and we tried playing frisbee in the park by his house, but then we remembered that we both suck at it. So after about 5 minutes, we decided that we should go get some KK instead. Went there, got a free donut, then went to King Soopers to get supplies to try... <strong>craw dad fishing</strong>. While we were there, we found the coolest shopping cart ever. It was a race car! So we pushed each other around in that for a while, and pissed some people off. Oooo, and in the parking lot, I saw Brittney and her boyfriend. I talked to them for a while, then some lady get into the car next to us, and she was about.. middle aged. At <strong>least</strong>. She started her car, started to pull out, and then turned on some gangsta rap really really loud. I started cracking up and was keeled over by the time she backed out. <strong>Hilarious</strong>. Then I saw Brian, and talked to him for a while. It's weird how everyone I know was at the King Soopers parking lot. 

Then we tried crawdad fishing, but to no avail. It was far too dark, I think that the fishies were sleeping! After that we sat in my car for about an hour listening to some country, then *//\\//sync, then Tarzan. 


Well, I know there's a reason to change."

"event","I lost my fucking keys tonight. I found them at 10:22. Thank gosh it takes 8 minutes to get home right? No. I get home at 10:31. As I pull in the driveway, I can see my mom's head looking at me from the window. Why would she be looking out the window at 11:30? Because she's a fucking bitch that's why. I come in and I can hear her whispering shit to my step dad. Then she comes downstairs and says, ""you were going a little fast up that hill, weren't you?"" ""No, mom, I was going 25."" ""Oh well, you came in at 11:33, and it's now 11:35. You're grounded"" ""Mom, my clock says 11:31, I'm one minute late, sorry"" ""Look at the clock in the kitchen. It says 11:35 too. 2 out of 3, you're grounded"".

What a damn bitch. She's mad because I've now opted to spend more time with my dad. I like it better over there because I don't have her breathing down my neck all fucking day. Except when she calls. Like she did 8 times the one day I spent there.

Hmm.. Fritz will be here in about a month. Part of me doesn't want him to come at all. I'm sure we'll have fun, and he'll be a nice boy, but damn, it hurts when they leave. I cried all fucking day when Adam left. 

Anyways, I'm lonely. I'm tired of screwing everything up. Anything good that happens to me.. I screw it up. I'm so fucking sick of it. I miss gettting butterflies when I see someone. I found myself determined to get someone back. But there's nothing I can do. I fucked it up. And now I'm just falling..  spiralling downward, hoping someone is at the bottom of this black hole to catch me.

Who still comes over even though my dogs bark at him constantly. Who doesn't expect me to sit and wait for him, and understands that I like spending time with my friends too. Who will sing with me. Who I'm comfortable being in my <STRONG>sweats</STRONG> with. Who takes late walks around the lake with me. Who has ""little surprises"" and makes real plans for the night. Who can carry on a <STRONG>good</STRONG> conversation. Who doesn't make me feel dumb every chance they get, and from time to time, lets me be right. </P>
<P>Oh man, that shouldn't be <STRONG><U>TOO</U></STRONG> hard. </P>
<P>This year's love had better last.</P>
<P><BR>It's times like these when I think of you and wonder if you ever think of me... </P>"

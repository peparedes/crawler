But frankly I think video blogging would be fun and something to pass on to my kids I&nbsp;guess when they get older. Just thinking out loud.<br /><br />On top of that I updated my Twitter account and been keeping up with Facebook too. MySpace has kind of lost it's draw and appeal, but with all the new changes Facebook keeps implementing that might go by the wayside eventually too.<br /><br />Other than that, I'm doing fine. Family is fine... and we are still standing :)&nbsp;YAY! Faire is coming up soon, and so are birthdays and other things. I'm just keeping busy.<br /><br /><p>Hope y'all are well!</p><p>Me</p>"

Keane - Somewhere Only We Know
 
 I walked across an empty land,
 I knew the pathway like the back of my hand.
 I felt the earth beneath my feet,
 Sat by the river and it made me complete.
 Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
 I'm getting old and I need something to rely on.
 So tell me when you're gonna let me in,
 I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin.
 
 I came across a fallen elm tree,
 I felt the branches; are they looking at me?
 Is this the place we used to love?
 Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?
 
 Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
 I'm getting old and I need something to rely on.
 So tell me when you're gonna let me in,
 I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin.
 So if you have a minute why don't we go,
 Talk about it somewhere only we know?
 This could be the end of everything.
 So why don't we go, somewhere only we know,
 Somewhere only we know.

"event","It goes by so fast. Just a little over 8 months ago, I welcomed Roan Orren Lee Steindler into this world. My little 8lb 3oz bundle of cuteness. That little bundle has grown so much to develop SUCH a HUGE personality. And become quite the Mama's boy. :) Of course I am encouraging him to be independent of me and strike out on his own from time to time, but I like to hold on as long as I can. I'm going to miss these first early months. 

This morning, around 5:30am I woke with a start. I nudged my husband and frantically asked ""Where's the BABY???"" Seeing as Roan would wake about every 2 hours like clockwork and about 2am would not go back to sleep on his own so he'd end up sleeping with us and I'd wake to a kick in the ribs about this time. I bolted out of bed to find him comfortably and VERY asleep in his crib... with his bear-bear in his arms. I stood there for a moment, smiled and then went back to bed. I then awoke to the happy sounds of a playing baby at 7am. His normal waking time. 

I think there is a little part of me that is sad. I won't have him snuggled next to me as often. He's getting bigger. He won't be such a mama's boy. He won't need me as much for comfort. And I quietly mourn those passed moments that I've cherished these 8 months. How much I miss him being so little. But the true joy is in the anticipation of his growth and learning. How he already pulls himself up on the furniture but hasn't quite mastered crawling. How he already wants to take his first steps. How he had started to fuss when sleeping because I was holding him and how he slept better when I just let him lay next to me without my arms around him. And how because of that WE BOTH slept better. 

I know that every parent goes through this in some way and I knew my time was coming. I think I have to most beautiful wonderful son in the whole world. And as his mom, its my pleasure to think so. I think every mom and dad should think that of their own children :) I think Roan's smile could cure any ailment of the world, as it does in our little home. 

I may miss how little and cute and cuddly he was just a few months ago, but I look forward to him talking, feeding himself, walking, running...running around the house naked lol and just growing to be the best little man he can. It goes by so fast. Ben was gone in a blink it seemed. So this time around I've imprinted every memory and took tons of pictures and video... but I never feel its enough. I want to hold on just a little longer to my baby boy... because soon he'll be a toddler. I will take more pictures and ingrain every moment to memory and watch my son grow in the hopes he'll lead a very long and happy life.

Until then, I'll try not to blink."

They live in Forest Falls (east of Big Bear) we're watching the news coverage on the fires that are burning across Southern California right now while a dear friend of ours waits to see if her house fell victim to this treacherous event of mother nature. There is no smoke blowing this way nor do we see any ash but we see Lake Arrowhead and the surrounding mountain communities burning via news coverage. This makes me think back to 2003 when the fires burned through San Bernardino very close to where Rob and I were living at the time. So much devastation as people lost not only their homes but their lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />So far only one reported death.. but so many homes have been lost. And were are hoping above all hope that our friends is not one of them. Pray for the residents of Arrowhead, San Diego, and all the other areas on fire right now... pray for those that have already lost their homes and those that still may and those that are friends of the victims too. Pray for the communities that are now supporting the evacuees. Just pray. Pagan, Christian, Jew, whatever you are... as the God/s for safe passage and healing for these folks.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the risk we take living in this beautiful state. That and the earthquakes. God and Goddess Bless to all.</p>"

"event","Well, my little son Roan&nbsp;is almost 3 months old. He's beautiful! And growing and smiling and an absolute JOY! The new homemade formula is working wonders and his thriving. We need to find him a new pediatrician, but I am going to be optimistic... rather than stress about it. Daniel and Rob and I are trying to get rid of the negative energies in our home... catch up on things and think about renting a bigger&nbsp;place as Roan will soon need his&nbsp;own room.&nbsp; 

Roan met his great aunties and great grandmother yesterday, he was all&nbsp;smiles. It's been 10 years since&nbsp;Ben. I still feel&nbsp;his presence especially now with his litter brother here. &nbsp;My aunt said I should try for another one when Roan is a year. LOL we shall see. My grandmother said he was beautiful and said how happy she was that I was able to have another child. Amazing coming from a woman whom my husband describes as having a constant expression of having eaten cat shit. YEA... lol.&nbsp; 

Our youngest female cat Jasmine, has adopted Roan as her own practically and is never far from him. When he cries she meows at me to ""do something... make it stop... wtf... "" LOL I don't know I don't speak fluent feline. But it's cute as hell. The dogs are not threatened by him. Precious licks him when I tell her to give him kisses, Tink is careful how she jumps on the bed when I have him laying on it. I am amazed at our animals and how wonderfully sensitive and intuitive they are about the baby.&nbsp; 

Samhain is almost upon us, then Thanksgiving, then Hanukkah and then Yule... the holidays are here and I'm thankful for new friends and family. I cannot see for myself what the future will hold, and yes I am anxious about certain things, but I see the calm resolve and prosperity that awaits once we are through the storm. There were a lot of changes to our lives and family in this past year so the dust hasn't settled yet. But it will.&nbsp; 

I hadn't had a chance to update my LJ for a while, the baby wasn't giving me ANY free time not even with steady nap times, but he's getting better and a schedule for him has started to emerge and take form for us, which allows me the needed time to keep up with housework, homework, friends, email etc. I will post more pics of my beautiful baby boy later on in the week when I get the chance. :) 

I hope everyone is well and I send you my blessings"

"event","Well, MY DARLING dearest step-daughter arrived safely Wednesday :) and we had dinner at BJ's and had Rib's and Pizookie. (Cookie cooked in deep dish pizza style pan served hot with Ice cream YUM) It's so good to see her. We've not seen her since last summer and while so much seems to have changed, she is still the same sweet bubbly child she always is. And it's always a pleasure having her stay&nbsp; with us. Sadly she's only here till Aug 8th, but we will make the most of it.<br /><br />So yesterday, she came with Rob and I to my OB appointment, where I had my final ultrasound. AND OUR SON IS BEAUTIFUL!!! :) We got an image of his profile: <br /><br /><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v632/FOXTAIL_Witchymel/BabyRoanProfileedit7-12-07.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />He's got his mom's chin :) hehehehehe! We are all so excited, I'm a little nervous, I mean it's been 10 years since I have had to give birth. I wish Ben was still here so he could meet his little brother. I am so grateful for Claire being his big sister though, at least he's got an older sibling to assist in his corruption! LOL<br /><br />He's also dropped lower into my belly, so it could be any day now, OR he could wait it out till his due date. We shall see. :) SO after my appointment we went and had dinner at a Greek/Mediterranean restaurant in Burbank and then saw the NEW Harry Potter movie which was AWESOME!!! Oh, yea and Sirius DIES (come on all, you've got to have read the book!) Got some Cold Stone Ice Cream after and the clerks there were so funny when we were chatting about the movie, one gal just shouted ""NOOOOOOOOOOO... DON'T TALK ABOUT IT I'VE NOT SEEN IT YET!!!"" We laughed, what can I say we all had a great time.<br /><br />So today was just a day, went to Target, found some more adorable baby clothes on clearance. My second baby shower is Sunday. Will be just family for this one. Michelle (my wonderful sister) is going to have it at the our Spa, so pretty setting and it will be just a pleasant day. :) Looking forward to that.<br /><br />We're planning a day at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor in the next 2 weeks (baby timing willing) and perhaps a day at Knotts Berry Farm (again Baby willing) I've pre-ordered 2 copies of the latest Harry Potter book and I am just taking this life one day at a time. Best I can do considering I'm carrying an 8lb basketball in my belly LOL :) <br /><br />SO that is my update, hope this finds y'all healthy and happy and staying cool in this summer heat!"

"event","Well, I haven't updated in a while, but thanks to a little ""nudge"" from a lj friend, I suppose I shall! :) Hope this finds everyone well and healthy who are reading. As for me, I am 5 weeks away from my due date of Aug. 4th. My beautiful step-daughter arrives to stay for a month on July 11th. Fathers day was nice, made Jambalaya and trifle for dessert and went to my folks, watched movies with dad and the boys. :) I feel as big as a house. Aches and pains are a pain.. lol but soon, I should be holding a little...well perhaps not SO little bundle and hopefully my brain will not remember all this discomfort I have been in these last months.

A dear and close friend of mine moved to North Carolina, and I miss him terribly, but we talk almost every day. He starts his new job on Monday and I wish him all the best. He's phone call #2 when I go into labor lol, Rob is #1 if he's at work. If he is at home then #2 goes up to #1. I still have to get together a phone tree. Just a small one for those that requested to be notified when our little bundle does decide to brave the bright lights of the world. :)

Tomorrow is our ""Huggies Hullaballoo Potluck Poohfest Picnic"" baby shower party. We are so looking forward to seeing friends and family there. Sadly not everyone could make it that we know and love, and for many good reasons, and they will be missed. Hopefully tomorrow isn't going to be TOO hot of a day, but we'll have the pop up canopy and hopefully the shade will help and we'll have a breeze.

As for me, I am on the last legs of this happily uneventful pregnancy, emotions still running the gambit, but for the most part I've been pretty good. Didn't think I'd ever be here again, but it gives me hope to try for just one more (perhaps a girl this time? who knows!) and then... then it's no more trying. If I end up pregnant again, it will only be by the grace of the gods. I think of another friend who just had her third child, getting pregnant just after having her second. Best of wishes to you Vala, I know you will be a busy but very loving and wonderful mom.

So I think that is all the updates. If I think of anymore I'll post. Here's to the coming July month. Hope everyone has a happy 4th of July and I am SOOOO looking forward to Harry Potter on the 11th. WOOT! So many cool movies out this summer. :) GO SEE THEM! :) Loves to all!"

Gotta love it when it seems people just start to get a clue about life. This person will know who they are in this next typed thought, whether they check up on my journal or not doesn't matter to me anyhow.

PCOS. 

I was diagnosed with this about 3 years ago. In late Oct of 2005, I went in to the ER with severe excruciating pain in my lower left abdomen. A cyst that had formed on my left fallopian tube had ruptured, leaking fluid into the lower left abdominal cavity. I had laproscopic surgery done, and only a portion of the cyst removed as it had vasculyzed around the left fallopian tube (created veinous like attachments to the tube) and the doctor didn't want to compromise our chances of conception, so left it intact. 

DURING THIS TIME, I was accused of many things by our then current roomates who were minding our house while my husband and I stayed with my folks, considering we were in the process of finding a new home closer to our families. I was recovering from surgery and posted to my blog that we had found a house to rent. Asinine melee amongst the retarded proceeded from there. Apparently it wasn't enough that I called the day AFTER my evening LJ post to inform the roomates of the news. Oh no, I then became pariah #1.&nbsp; Not to rehash old shit, but it just got me thinking about all the dumb crap that was said over NOTHING. Lets just hope they are more considerate when it turns out to be them in the future.

We've since decided that to help those that are less fortunate and in need of assistance has only opened us up to criticism, abuse, betrayal, and debt. A LOT of debt. So we've stopped. My health is better for it. My first pregnancy ultrasound showed that the partial cyst on the left fallopian tube was no longer there, and the cysts in both ovaries seemed to have disappeared as well. 

Thank the GODS.

Like I said, not much to report, so I merely posted a rampant trailing thought that is now down at the bottom of the pit of the long past thought of thoughts and being flushed away into history as I type. LOL, what a visual.

Hope all is well with all."

Most of what I want to be able to say, I wouldn't trust the people who read it. Now that doesn't go for everyone on my list, but just a few who have access to it. 

I suppose understanding that my personal thoughts going across the internet wave lengths really doesn't make them all that personal anymore. It's been an interesting couple of years on Live Journal that is for sure. Many people have come into and gone out of my life, for various reasons, some good, some not good. 

I am 5 months pregnant with my second son, my first being my angel Benjamin. How I wish he was here to be a big brother to the new little one. How much I miss Ben. We're still toying with the name of this one. It's not coming to me as easily as Ben's did. I'm working at the spa these days, been here almost 2 months, and that's been exhausting! While it's only part time, it still takes a lot out of me. I suppose working at the front desk is a little better than being the all around gopher bitch, as I have only a little interaction with the Big Boss, yea, mom's a slave driver and could drive the Dali Lama NUTSO! Love her as much as I do, none of us can tolerate her type A-EXTREME personality for too long before we're pulling our hair out. But I should hopefully only be here through May and perhaps part of June, the only thing I dread really is having to train someone to replace me for morning shift. I am sure Sarah is WAY better at training people than I am.

&nbsp;Baby is fine, doing pop rocks in my belly. At least that is what it feels like. The boys are being as helpful as they can around the house as I am not home to do much in the way of domestics, but I wasn't much help when I wasn't working either. Food is still falling under the ""icky"" category so I'm still not eating the way I should, but thanks to the prescription of TIGAN I am eating something. I can manage a cup of really REALLY weak coffee, but I haven't even finished that today.

Putting up with family in bad moods is the only down side to working at the spa. Their moods then reflect on me, and I get to be the target of their complaints even if they are unfounded. :( Oh well, love them anyway, I had no choice to have them as family, what can you do?

That is pretty much it for me this month. Not much else going on, rather peaceful, quiet and uneventful. Renaissance Faire is starting up again this year, and Daniel is working it for the first time. This should prove interesting :) I am only planning on doing 1 day a weekend, more than that I'm going to be stretching my limits! So till we blog again, blessings to all! :)"

The trade off is I have to work at the spa for Friday and Saturday. Oh well, I'll just be filling in as receptionist. It'll be fun.

Tomorrow is Rob's and my handfasting anniversary, he's working, but we'll do something special together on Sunday :) For tomorrow morning when he gets home from work, I want to get him a card and make breakfast for him in the morning, have clean dishes etc... ;) surprise him. And no he doesn't read my LJ so I am not worried about posting it here ROFL.

Physically I'm getting over the sinus infection/head cold thing I've had for the last week, and while I have body aches from playing SKEEBALL on Tuesday, I am doing ok.

Other than that, nothing else to report. SO I'm off to make some dinner."

The gift I was given that is you, will never be forgotten, no matter how much time has passed, you will always be in my heart and soul. I miss you my dearest love. You are the one and only who captivated my heart and showed me the true meaning of love in all it's forms.

You have my heart, my true love, my soul, I wish I could see your face again, as sweet and tender as it was then. But some things are not meant to be for us. Not this life, not this lifetime.

Eight years it's been since that dreadful day when we had to say goodbye. I will always remember you, that smiling, laughing, loving spirit that brightened every heart he touched.

My step daughter is heading home today :) It was a wonderful crazy visit. We went to the beach late on Saturday and walked Santa Monica Pier. Magic Mountain was a blast but it sucks about the news of it's impending sale and possible shut down in the near future. 

We're having dinner with the whelp and Step-wife :) which will be nice to see Wil again. The house is a jumble of happy pups, pets and people and I always love a jumble house. 

Things are peaceful, which is always good. And we may get to go to Havascu later this summer with T&J and the kids. WOOT! :) 

Hopefully the weather will stop being so sticky and hot, and just be hot... but who knows, thank gods for A/C and fans!

"event","Ok so the strangest thing happened to me this morning on my way to the dentist. I got ambushed by a flock of flying stinging bugs on the freeway, one of which flew in my open window and impaled my chest and stung me.

About 30-40 of them splattered at once up and across my windshield and front grill at 75mph. Scared the living hell out of me.

THEN the intense and blinding fucking pain hit the center of my chest.

And then I remember, my fucking EPI PEN is still packed with my camping stuff from this past weekend. SHIT! I hope it was not bees. I'm screwed if it's bees.

yea.. I am allergic to bees, thank god it wasn't bees, it was those black and yellow striped wasps and thank god fucking that impaled asshole wasp died on impact at 75mph otherwise he'd have stung me multiple times and then I would have been fucked anyway.

Shithowdy.

I finally got off the freeway safely, thank the gods, then I chuck norris'd his ass (which was all that was left of him sticking out of my skin) and flung that broken off ass and stinger out the fucking window.

PWND! thats right. stupid wasps.

Thank god I am alive, but my chest still fucking hurts in that spot. Goddamn migrating wasp fuckers. I hope I killed the queen as they all went splat across my windscreen. Stupid lemming wasps. Sheesh.

ouch, fucking spot still hurts. Damn right sore. Yea, I iced it, I squeezed out the venom, and I put antibiotic stuff on it. It didn't spread, or welt much bigger than a penny. I am ok now. But that EPI PEN is now in my purse.

Weird how they were swarmed out of nowhere in the middle of the damn freeway.

going to bed now. Nighty night."

Other than that, it's pretty quiet, peaceful. I'm content, the doggies and kitties are content. So it's all good. Just glad to have finally gotten done the one thing I loathe this time of year, and no, NOT spring cleaning, though I did that this weekend too.

I need to go shopping today and buy him a little gift and a card. Not sure what he wants or needs...

Bobbie will be coming over to install new vid card for my computer so I can actually play EQ with them. :) Looking forward to that. It's been another challenging week as I have had little or no energy but Rob, being the supportive trooper that he is, well, I just love him.

Faith was born with a birth defect, and to the love of one young boy, she now has a happy, healthy home and loving family and is a miracle of mother nature and perserverance of humanity when it comes to our love for her children.

I don't think I could say anything that would really do this story justice, so I will post the video here... as well as the website.

I know I love and adore my dogs, and I would do anything for them, as they are more than just dogs, but they are family... but this is truly looking past a handicap for a dogs family, and this dog, if it ever made it to the pound... would probably not have been so quickly adopted. This whole story moved me, so for you all.. enjoy."

I feel bruised, sore, achy, tired, and  frustrated that I have no energy, even after taking the dogs for a walk and tidying up the house. I try to keep active so I can keep the adrenaline going but I just keep waking up with the worst tension headaches and body soreness and I want to curl up and sleep until I feel better. Except, I can't sleep feeling like this, even after drinking herbal tea with Valerian, which helps me sleep maybe 3 hours... and when I wake up I don't feel better.

I think it's time to call the doctor and start getting some SERIOUS referrals. I can't take much more of this.

In other news, things are going rather smoothly, and we are stable, happy, loving, enjoying ourselves and enjoying life, the dogs and the cats.

Lately, Rob and I have gotten into watching a very intersting and informative show on National Geographic Channel Called ""The Dog Whisperer"" with Cesar Millan. We purchased special show leads for all three dogs, and today was the first day of formal ""rehabilitation"" of the girls and training for Rob and I :) We implemented the simple techniques and guides from his people training. We are the pack leaders, and we need to calmly assert ourselves in such a manner that the dogs fall in line in deference and submission. Exercise, Discipline THEN Affection. In that order. And it's a calm assertive pack leader that does not yell, hit or deal with the dogs in an aggressive manner. It's that calm assertion that ""I"" (the owner) am the pack leader and ""you"" (the dog/s) will follow me. It's a nice plesant life of ""Follow the leader"". It's worked miracles already!

So this afternoon, they all walked VERY well by themselves, and Precious and Lani ran well with Rob, Tinkerbelle, however didn't like the idea of not being in control and proceeded to twist herself around in the lead in attempts to chew and bite at it, and managed to give the side of her mouth and gums a bit of friction burn, and a small cut. We brought her back to the house, gave her some water, hosed her down a little and had her be calm. She's fine now, but I am sure a little more practice with her on the lead, so she doesn't pull and make herself uncomfortable, is needed.

Despite the energetic walk and run that both Precious and Lani had, when let out in the back yard, they managed to dig yet ANOTHER hole into Terry's yard where his dog Mandy is. Sweet girl, Mandy. So trying to get the girls back onto our property was fun as Precious took the chance and ran across the street away from us.

Somehow I was able to grab a burst of energy and run straight ahead, cutting both her and Lani off, and herded them back to the front door, where Rob was waiting. Well, it's only day one, so much for the ""no digging"" theory of exercise. Perhaps we needed to go longer? But they looked so TIRED and were panting HARD. I think because we've never kept them on a consistant walking schedule they are not used to the strenuous exercise (hell, NEITHER are WE!!) But this routine is good for all of us.

Now just to keep up with it daily. So we're going to try again tomorrow and again Sunday, and again Monday and just keep going from there. It'll be good for Rob and I to get the exercise with the girls, as I am sure we are both in need of it, not just for our weight, but moreso for our health and hearts.

We have placed ""The Dog Whisperer"" on our TiVo record list and are enjoying the people training that Cesar gives and loving the rehabilitation ""miracles"" that really aren't miracles, but natural reactions to a well balanced pack mentality. I recommend it for ALL dog owners and suggest both his book and his DVD.
Check out these websites:
http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/ or http://www.dogpsychologycenter.com/ which both link to basically the same page, and http://www.ngcdogwhisperer.com/

There are blogs on the National Geographic site that you can read from as far back as Episode 1. We are ever indebted to Cesar and his training of us into the pack leaders we are meant to be for our dogs.</lj-cut>

A Calm Assertive Pack Leader makes for a happy, healthy and content pack :)"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Green is not my favorite color, but it's up there."">I figure some of you were curious about my last post. Let me just say that my mom has always had her issues, with us, her family, life itself, and tends to blame everyone else around her for the shortcomings in her life as opposed to the decisions she's made for herself.

Also let me say that my parents should have divorced like 20 years ago. But it's moot now, I think its beyond them now to stay married, and civil. 

My mother is also dealing with the death of her sister's beloved husband of 40 years, and watching her sister, who cannot even rely on her own son for comfort, deal with lonliness and depression makes her question her own marriage and life.

It's beyond seeing the glass as half empty, the glass is knocked over and shattered into little bits in my moms eyes. There is no recovery of the relationship and she blames my dad for a lot that has gone wrong. And my dad blames her for a lot. Personally I think they are both to blame and both at fault. And neither are willing to budge to make anything right. Too many past hurts and issues clouding judgment.

So lets get to last night, a stressed out emotional mom, on her birthday, 2 strong margarita's and an emotional breakdown (that was long overdue I might add) later, she is feeling more than strung out. I am doing my best to be supportive and understanding, and not letting old childhood issues get in the way of that. Let's just say, it's always been about mom, always will be about mom and mom has ""always carried all the burdens of the family"" while we've ""sat on our asses, done nothing and not cared"" (according to her). To a small point that has been true, but she's never let us have opinions or our own thoughts of our whole family. What she's said goes, and that's been that.

It's not as bad as it seems however, when she is calm she can be objective, just last night was emotional overload and I was there to ease the blow so to speak. Dad in his own way tries to keep some kind of interaction going between them, but mom just sees it as an invasion of privacy. One of these days they will be on the same page with eachother and get over this bullshit. Or they will divorce FINALLY and stop driving eachother and all of us crazy.

Today is a better day. Mom didn't have a hangover, she seemed to pull herself together, and Dad is coming over tonight to spend a couple days with us. I am not sure what the future holds. Here is where I have to buckle down, go day by day and not worry about tomorrow which is my norm. 

You'd think I would have collapsed and died from all the pressure, stress and crap I've dealt with over the last 5 months. But it just reinforces the fact that I am stronger and more able than I've realized and that it takes more than a few assholes fucking with me to bring me down... actually nothing but the Goddess herself will bring me down. I've proven that to myself. 

So, for all that are worried, don't be, I'm ok, I am just dealing with my family at a very difficult and challenging time and it's not even close to being over. 

I do want to give KUDOS and love to my husband, for without whom I'd be a basket case. Rob you have been more than wonderful, and the best friend and mate I could have ever hoped for or dreamed of. I am sorry to have ever taken you for granted. I love you sweetheart.

To my friends that have supported me and listened to me vent and purge, thank you, I am sure there is more of the same to come, but thank you for being there :)

I am enjoying the cool days with the bright shining sun. Rain is expected over the weekend (my bones can feel it) but I just hope that Friday is a beautiful day. Friday, being St Patrick's Day, is my mom's birthday. She said she doesn't want to go out to dinner or do anything until after the mourning period for my auntie passes. I am going to buy her plants for her house. She doesn't like cut flowers (they are dead and don't last) My sister thought up the idea of having a party for her dog, Peanut, but thinking more on it, I don't think she'd appreciate it as her reasons for not wanting to celebrate her birthday fall under respect for the dead and surviving. So, we're postponing a nice family dinner.

Fibro, with this weather, has been kicking my ass, but Dad is home now, so I don't have to worry about him too much. Speaking of Dad, his recovery is going well. Doctor said he could drive as of last week. So for the most part life is getting back to it's regular beat. 

Rob's work is going great. The only thing that sucks is with all the bills we had to pay we could not save for plane tickets to Tennessee for Spring Break. BUT, we're budgeting and keeping a tight reign on finances so we can bring Claire out here over the summer. I wonder if people even realise the supplemental damage they cause others? Ah, doesn't matter anyhow, all back bills are paid and we're doing fine. 

American Idol will be interesting this year, as there are a lot of ""likeable"" singers there. Some are really great singers, some just good. Not sure yet who my pick is, but Chris Daughtry is a fav, as well as Mandeesa, both have some PIPES on them and can rock out. Elliot, while he has a good voice, sadly reminds me of someone that I'd like to see smeared across the bottom inside of a whale's intenstines. Though Elliot is by far the better looking of the two and I am sure is a much nicer person. Kellie Pickler is a simple country girl, with a sad story, and I feel for her, she's cute, but stupid. Not a good match for the next Idol. The other two girls: Paris and Lisa are good.. but eh... Bucky.. OMG what is with the hair? Taylor Hicks rocks too; Ace, pretty boy, can't sing. Katharine is hot; Kevin does look like Chicken Little, scares me when he's singing though.. weird moves and that lisp... ugh! Oh and Melissa - well who the fuck cares, she got voted off last night. 

So that's it from me for now :)

Rob's got his yearly physical today. We had a great time yesterday shopping. Got that Big Dog nurse's sweatshirt I've been wanting to get him. ""BIG DOG NURSE - Your BUTT is MINE"" (holding a syringe) *giggles* We got Tinkerbelle a larger collar, only to realize her head is too small for her body. Fits around her neck nicely, but pulls right over and off her head ROFL!!! What to do?

What DELUSIONS you ask? Well, I don't think I have any, not recently anyway. But so many people in this world ARE deluded. It's just a truth of life. 

Had a great conversation last night with Bear. This morning we both woke up with sore throats, hopefully the Doc gives him something for his. 

I gotta go get ready for mom. A day of shopping with my favorite Lady! IKEA, *drool* has so many cool things. I LOVE being so close to all the stores, grocers, vintage shops and every other kind of store that I love. Oh yea, and to the beach. The next free, dry, sunny weekend we have, we're heading to the Pier, the Carousel, the Ferris wheel, 3rd Street Promenade too. Where else but beautiful Santa Monica! :) Haven't been there in ages.

Gotta be off into the shower.

"event","<lj-cut text=""Hail, snow... IT WAS WHITE!"">
Well... HAIL, but still, came down so hard and so much that it actually put a blanket covering on our yard for about a half an hour till it just rained. I was able to grab a handful and stick it in the freezer :D Our first ""snow"" at our home. Last time it snowed out in this area I was in 8th grade. I will never forget that! Precious looked excited to see the white blanket outside... so I let her out, but I think it was just a bit too wet for her.

Rob and I want to take the girls up to the mountains again with the snow. We shall see :) It was easy when Arrowhead was just up the hill, now it's almost a 2 hour drive. No bother though, Wrightwood isn't that far. I took pictures with my camera, you could see the hail pieces on the concrete. Even had a bit of a blanket of it on the neighbors roof. WAY COOL! 

Strange weather to have a week before Spring. (March 20th is Vernal Equinox) But I love the cold weather, great weather to snuggle up with my Boo Bear. Personally, I prefer the cold to the heat, though my body doesn't care for it much. My joints have been swollen for a WEEK now with the rain and cold front, and just as my body starts to get used to the cold weather, it gets warm again... California, only state where you can get all four seasons in less than a month. It's a wonder that the vegitation and plant life out here isn't deformed from the strange blooming weather. Oh... wait... UC Riverside... never mind! (snicker)

Ahhh... if only we had a wood burning fireplace indoors, would be perfect with a hot cup of cocoa, a good book and my hunny. Well, two out of three is better than nothing :D

Be warm and comfortable and watch it on those slick streets!

<lj-cut text=""Back to my normal blogthings: Dogs, Faire and Rain!"">

Battling a bit of a head cold, just received some startling information, I hope I get more clarification on it soon. Faire sign ups are tomorrow, and unfortunately in San Stinkin-Bernardino. At Orange Show... We've not decided if we are going to sign up or not. We'd like to as Santa Fe Dam isn't too far to drive for us. But we shall see.

Having the three pups here has been like having three toddlers vying for my affections, attentions and playing and tossing around blankets, toys and cushions. I'm keeping up with them amazingly :) and when Mr. Peanut comes to visit, it's mayhem, but they all seem to have a good time. Walkies is an adventure in itself as three (sometimes four) dogs all want to go in different directions! It's a sight to see :)

The rains are back, Lani loves the puddles, and loves to come in the house with muddy paws. Thank the gods for the swiffer wetjet. It's rained so beautifully that the plum trees are both in full bloom. One in shades of pink and lavender, and the other in shades of cream. Just gorgeous. 

Down the street is ""Jacks Pad"", a very friendly and adventurous chow mix who sends Precious into barking fits whenever he saunters by the house. She must have a crush on him (lol, naaah) Hardy says that the mini-blinds were ugly to begin with, and we're happy to change them out for regular curtains. This will also keep Precious from tangling herself up in them whenever Jack trots by. *shakes head* Goofball Doggie.

Sleep is always an interesting feat, as I am tangled up in three loving dogs, all wanting petpets, and giving kisses. But with this head cold, and as achy as I've been feeling, having three warm bodies curled up around me has been the best medicine. Not to mention a loving husband who has been nursing me with tea, kisses, and cookies. :) 

Got to talk to Walter this evening, it's really wonderful to hear how happy he's been, and I am looking forward to Rob and I meeting Grace. I am so proud of him and how far he's come, not only personally but professionally. 

I've got a few trips to plan for this year. There's one to Texas to visit Amelia, tentative, but she's gonna beat me if I don't make it out there :D There's one with my sister to where ever we want to go... Jet Blue Airways tickets that we won. Then there's Vegas with Rob and dad at the end of summer for Rob's nursing symposium. Nice things to look forward to amongst all the busy work at the Spa and family stuff going on. 

My auntie's birthday was the other day, Mom says she's been really down, and it's been so heartbreaking to see her alone now that my uncle is gone. Four months is too sudden... for a love that's lasted over 40 years. 

I was searching through my photos on my computer (YES I really was... I know! I know! NoOOoooo.. I wasn't looking for those ""intimate"" ones because really, they don't exist...anyhow) I found this wonderful picture of Rob and I taken about 2 years ago. The best smile on his face and you could see the bonfire reflected in his glasses. Just made me warm and fuzzy. I showed it too him too, told him how I loved the way he looked in it. It's so cute when he blushes.

Best thing is, we've managed through 4 years married, and through all our ups and downs, we're closer than ever. This move was the best thing for us. Closer to both our families, and time to just be us without anyone else crowding our lives with their own problems. Not that it's a bad thing... just wasn't good for us doing it for so long as we've tried to help a lot of our friends out while putting our lives on the back burner. We've been doing that the 4 years we've been married. It's great to be first now, it's helped a lot, especially when we've needed to be there for my family. 

So...that's the long and the short of life these days. I suppose you could call it my daily bliss. It's all good in the end.

Blessings to all and try to stay dry this weekend!

"event","Once, a long time ago, I cut myself.  For a week or so, I cut open my left arm, either in the middle of the forearm, or along three parts of my shoulder, all on the left arm.  I don't know why I did it.  I know I got the idea from someone who my first girlfriend had done some questionable (in a sexual manner) things with.  He told me about the whole ""real life"" vampire idea, ie people who drank either their own blood or another's.  Somehow, this led to me cutting myself, ostensibly to taste my own blood (I believe the standard description of blood's taste like that of copper).  Now, I need to say this wasn't anything ""serious"".  It left a slight mark, and the skin swelled up, but I really only cut until there was a decent amount of blood welling up in the cut...not even enough that it would drip down.  Then, to keep the image alive, I'd suck it a little, to get some taste of it.

But I really don't know if that was my real motivation for it.  To this day, it is something I really can not explain to myself...it goes against human nature, and I remember I found it very difficult to do.  So...if it was so hard, why did I do it?  My girlfriend didn't like it either, which just adds another incentive not to do it.  Admittedly, she didn't actually tell me to stop, she just said she didn't like it.

I also remember once trying to tell someone about it...I tried to make the cut on my forearm obvious, but when he didn't notice it, I brought it up, and ultimately said something along the lines of ""I cut myself"" and showed the cut to him.  He just kind of shrugged it off with an ""oh"".  I'll admit, he could have easily dismissed as something accidental, since it really didn't look like much more than a scratch.  No matter, I guess.  Just as I didn't really know why I cut myself, I also wasn't entirely sure why I wanted him to know.  He wasn't even my closest friend to begin with...more like someone I carpooled with.  Maybe I just thought someone should know, since it's really a rather bad thing to be doing to one's self.  Maybe I just wanted someone to say ""don't do that"".  Maybe I just wanted to relate to the person my girlfriend fooled around with.  I don't know.

To this day, four years later, I still don't."

"event","A few quick things that happened to me today:

-I finalized all my health insurance stuff today, and I even have a doctor's appointment in about an hour!  This means that I'll finally get rid of an infection I've had pumping through my veins for over a year and a half now.  To say I'm excited is a bit of an understatement.

-When I went to start up my computer today, I got a screen which allowed me to select from like 6 different start-up options...among these was an unassuming entry which read ""Windows"".  Intrigued, I opted to select it and, lo and behold, Windows booted up!  So, for the first time in about 2 weeks, I abruptly find myself able to play computer games again!  Huzzah to that.

-I'm also almost completely caught up on all my school work (I was put rather behind, since I started a week late)...as of Friday at 5, all of my late work will either be turned in or it will be too late to make it up...regardless, the make-up crap will be concluded Friday.  Other than that, school's going great, the work's not stupendously hard, and things are going really quite well in that area.


So...yeah.  Things are just swell! ^_^"

"event","Someone recently told me they absolutely hate when people begin papers with a definition.  So, in honor of that person, I begin:

According to Wikipedia, Polyamory is the desire, practice, or acceptance of having more than one loving, intimate relationship at a time with the full knowledge and consent of everyone involved.  It is similar to Polygamy, although I believe polygamy tends to be a more rigid system, and is perhaps more applicable to marriage.  Regardless, the concept of ""multiple"" relationships is something I've never really given much thought to.

Naturally, I have encountered the concept before in the past, but since I never really imagined it could apply to me, I didn't really give much thought.  Polygamy was something that happened in other religions, but since I was all Catholic (and, regardless of my current religious affiliation, would probably have a Christian wedding), it was something that happened to other people.  Then there's also the concept of ""open"" relationships.  Although essentially neutral about, there was something somehow did not sit well with me.  As I understood it, open relationships were for ""swingers"", once again something I never viewed myself as being.  If others want it, by all means, have and enjoy...but it didn't really seem appropriate for me.

So, polyamory.  Multiple, intimate relationships.  How's that not an open relationship.  Well, I think a key part of it is the INTIMATE thing.  It implies a genuine, emotional attachment.  Swinging is the exact opposite...fooling around with whatever happens to come your way.  In my mind, a truly polyamorous relationship leaves no room for one night stands, bar pick-ups, what have you.

Another question...can it work?  I guess to answer that, you first have to decide...does love (read: an emotional, romantic relationship) necessitate singular devotion to one person?  Is it truly an all or nothing deal, where, in falling in love with a person, all of your ""romantic resources"" are transferred to that one person?  A difficult question.  Well, chew on this.  When you break up with someone, do you stop loving them?  Indeed, even after moving on and starting anew, doesn't SOME feeling still remain for your past loves?  To this day, I know I still have a blind spot for my first girlfriend, and there are times where I might still pine for her, wish I could be with her again.  If it is possible to be in a truly loving relationship with one person, while still maintaining a lingering sense of attachment to an ex, perhaps that means love doesn't have to be monogamous...maybe it can be shared.  

Imagine...people complain about how complex monogamous relationships are, how difficult it must be to work out an arrangement with three, or even more people!  I've always felt the most important quality in a relationship (of any sort really) is a capacity for communication.  Naturally, the only way for communication to foster, there also needs to be a very strong, mutual, sense of respect and trust (and probably a bit of patience) fostered.  The potential for deceit, coercion, even infidelity (and it is definitely possible in a polyamorous relationship) are magnified tremendously, and the only way the inevitable pitfalls can be worked out is through honest communication, and the commitment to work through them.

Clearly, there need to be strong guidelines worked out, and I would feel they should be clearly outlined and discussed by all members of the relationship to work...and all should abide by them.  Naturally, just what these rules are will depend on the people.  I don't think I could honestly handle an open relationship, and don't feel there is room for haphazard ""sleeping around"" for any relationship I am a part of.  However...if another member truly has some attraction/attachment to a person they've known, and I am aware of this before any fooling around has happened, I think I could bring myself to accept this.  Indeed, I also think I would rather enjoy that type of freedom myself.

Which brings me to another aspect...the possible benefits of polyamory.  First and foremost (and I do believe this is more important), there are more than just the two people in the relationship.  When there are disputes between members (as there inevitably will be), the third person can act as a mediator of sorts, acting as a sympathetic ear for both parties, and hopefully helping to diffuse and help heal the situation.  Naturally, there is also the benefit of having a little ""variety"" in a relationship, since the relationship doesn't need to come to an end solely because there is an attraction to another person (we are still animals, to a degree).  There are also economic and familial advantages, but I won't delve into them at the moment, since I'm a bit young and don't really desire to consider that stage of my life quite yet.

Naturally, there are also some rather compelling issues that might arise.  The first, and most obvious, is the issue of jealousy.  Not everyone is capable of sharing their loved one, and this is something that needs to be worked out immediately, if the relationship is to continue in a healthy manner.  I feel that this is where the trust and communication issues come most strongly into play.  Adding another person into the mix needs to be decided carefully, and all members of the group should have equal say in the decision.  In that absence of that, it becomes far too easy for cheating...fooling around with someone without the knowledge of the members of the group.  In fact, I would say this can be even more detrimental in a polyamorous relationship...a whole group can be broken up if that is trust is compromised, and since it is so essential, that trust can be far far harder to get back once it's lost.  I'll also just mention in passing, for your own consideration, the difficulty members of a polyamorous relationship must have with making the nature of their relationship known to a rather close-minded world.

Alright, I'd say I'm pretty done for now.  I would just like to close by mentioning that I wrote this up really only considering a relationship which is completely balanced in nature...there can also be so called ""V"" relationships, where there is a single person who has two partners that aren't involved with each other on quite as deep a level as the center connector (if they were, that could be a triangle relationship), as well as there being a central ""primary"" relationship, with satellite ""secondary"" relationships only fulfilling certain needs (be they solely emotional, sexual, or what have you), in addition to many others.

All in all, it makes for some pretty interesting reading.  I definitely recommend checking out the wiki article on it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory  If for no other reason, it is interesting to consider another, radically different, approach to something that has a rather standardized (and perhaps flawed, or at least incomplete, given divorce rates nowadays) preconception in our society."

"event","So, I've been thinking about updating this thing for something like a week now, but I've just not actually sat down to do it.  Admittedly, this is partly due to a lack of inspiration (though I've no shortage of material...).  Regardless, I've decided to just sit down and, inspiration or not, start typing.  Forgive any stream of conscious writing that may ensue, I assure, 'tis not intentional.

Right, so, for those who don't know, I don't live in Saugus anymore.  If you're reading this, you should know that already, but just in case, there it is.  I'm not in Allston, living in an apartment with this cool cat I met from New England Institute of Art.  He's an animation student, fellow Capoerista (moreso than me, as of late, frustrating as that may be), fellow philosophizer, and all-around good guy.

I must say, although I may have moved out rather abruptly (and perhaps a bit early, in retrospect), I am eternally glad that I did so.  Since moving (and especially thanks to who I moved with), I have met some very cool people who I do believe are beginning to fill some voids I've had for awhile.

Chronologically, the first of these new additions was a character we shall refer to as Angel.  I can confidently say he is nothing like any other friend I've ever had.  Big hair, womanizer, gangsta, playa, partier, listener of rap...these things all apply to Angel.  Not exactly standard friend material for me.  Nonetheless, we seemed to hit it off, and for a good 1.5 to 2 months, I saw the kid essentially daily.  It was quite an experience.  To say there was a generous amount of alcohol imbibed is an understatement.  All in all, it was a fairly good time.

However, there was recently...an event that occurred.  It involved much alcohol, keys being borrowed, and stormy emotions.  The long and the short of it is I've come the closest I've ever been to an all out fight with someone, and it was a bit of an eye-opener in some ways.  First off, I've never imagined that I'd find myself in a situation that could cause ME to escalate a situation to a physical confrontation, so that was strange.  It also made me rethink how freely I trust people, since the situation came about due to how freely I trust people.  Nonetheless, the situation did ultimately end with no one being hurt (physically) and a status quo of sorts being restored.  Nonetheless, my friendship with Angel, while not being put to an end, has certainly been changed.  *shrugs*  It was a learning experience.

Next up: Pete and Pete (not their real names, but whatev).  Although I did, technically, meet them before Angel, I don't think I started really getting to know them until after Angel, so they come second.  They are congenital (though not identical) twins, and they're honestly the shit, near as I can tell.  One, Peta (think Peter with a Bostonian accent) is all about plants and whatnot.   At first glance, I definitely connected more with him than his brother (we'll say Peter).  I think this is because he seems to be, like me, quieter and more introspective.  We've had many cool and interesting conversations, and I definitely like the guy.  My one complaint is it seems to be mildly difficult to get him away from his girlfriend/partner/girl interest/wtf ever.

However, the marauding girl left the stage clear for me to get to know his brother, Peter.  Now, this is a cool guy.  Far more energetic and out going than his brother, Peter nonetheless has a deep side that I actually find I identify even more with than Peta.  Truly, the more I get to know him, the more I value his friendship and, in truth, prefer it over Peta's (although they're really both awesome, so it's a moot point, especially given their brotherly, nigh constant, togetherness).  Regardless, we seem to be growing ever closer, and I'm thankful for that.

And now, the most recent addition to my social circle...a girl I met through my roommate.  I'm not even sure what to call her, so I won't.  Regardless, her entrance to my life definitely turned things upside down.  Out of the blue, I started feeling emotions I've literally not felt in years.  For once, I find myself actually WANTING to worry about another.  I freely acknowledge that there is probably much pain that can arise from pursuing a serious relationship of any sort with her, yet I don't care.  If anything, that makes me want to be with her all the more.  Even more amazing?  She seems to return the feelings.

So, what's the catch?  The catch, dear readers, is she's with my roommate.

"event","So, this morning I got home from a party that concluded one of the single best weeks of my life.  I had my Bautizado yesterday, which is a big festival we have once a year in Capoeira.  It was my group's first Bautizado on our own, and it was truly incredible.  Our mestre, Cabeca, came over from Brazil, and we had high level cords from New York and California over with their students.  We had an entire week of workshops, two presentations, and I moved up a rank...I'm now a full-fledged yellow cord ^_^

Then we had the party last night, which was just amazing.  I never realized I could have such a good time at a party, but it makes a huge difference when you actually know everyone their, and literally everyone's good friends.  We were all hanging out together, joking around, Cabeca gave this really awesome thank-you speech, we all clapped and cheered for him, Italo, and ourselves.

The whole week, I've been either sleeping or doing Capoeira.  I've had virtually no free time.  I'm on the verge of being broke.  And I'm completely happy and, above all, satisfied.

Ayudame o Berimbau.  Ayudame a Cantar.
Help me Berimbau...help me to sing.

Take care all."

"event","So, in an unprecedented turn of events, I'm actually posting twice within a month of each other.  Kinda weird.

In either case, it's important to note that I'm feeling way better than last time.  I know I got Frank and Vo, and although it's true Fred's leaving, I don't actually know that that's necessarily a terrible thing.

I'm really unhappy about how school went this semester, and I think part of why it went so bad was Fred.  No offence to him, but it's hard to give a damn and try when the person who's in all the same classes as you (and also happens to be your friend) doesn't care, doesn't do his work, and does better than you.  *shrugs* Who knows?  Suffice to say I'm far more confident about my future, both academically and otherwise, than I was just a week or so ago.

Maybe it's the weather."

"event","Hmm...so, I guess I'm going to take a stab at writing something meaningful about my life in this old journal of mine.  It's been so long, I'm kinda out of practice. Ah well, here goes.

I've been worried lately.  Not the stomach clenching, paralyzing worry of looming disaster, but the more the quiet, passive worry of trouble, quite literally, on the horizon.  The antithesis of the so-called ""light at the end of the tunnel"".  It's a long way off, but it's coming inexorably closer, and I've yet to see how it can be stopped.

And as problems tend to be, I'm not sure how much of a problem this will really pan out to be.  I'm confident I'll make it through alright, but I'm not looking forward to it.

This perceived problem is my fall semester.  Through three very different courses of events coming together at once, it seems that the three closest people in my life will be, by and large, separated from me.  Vo's planning to move off to Umass Lowell, Frank's returning to school (which, in addition to his full-time job, will essentially bring his availability for chillage to zero) and Fred's planning on taking off with his friend for the semester.

Now, these aren't exactly insurmountable odds, clearly.  While it is true Vo will be far away, he does make the trip up to campus on a regular basis already, it'll just have to be reversed.  However, it'll make the spontaneous visits that are our typical strategies for hanging out less than feasible at the least, all but impossible at the worst.  Especially if he continues to have classes late as he does now, which I do fully expect him to.

Then there's Fred...his departure was the one I learned of first, and it's probably the one that worries me the most.  Whereas Vo will at least still be within driving distance, Fred plans to leave altogether.  He and his friend will be traveling constantly, and probably will be mainly more towards the Florida region.  He won't really be all that accessible.  The fact is, Fred filled a huge void within me that was left gaping when Ross died.  While it's true, he didn't fit the gap just right (think a circle small enough to fit in a square hole) he showed up in a point when I was missing something.  He's the asshole gamer that I can joke around with virtually constantly.  I can say anything to him, with no fear of offending, and he to me.  We compliment each other in public places so well that other people are attracted to our incessant chatter...perhaps solely because of the audacity of what we say sometimes.

Of course, the sad fact is, he's not Ross.  Even sadder, I know he has the exact type of relationship I had with Ross with his own friend (less than surprising) and the two compliment each other far better than I do with him, just like he and I don't match as I did with Ross.  But it's something, and now it looks like he's leaving.  The hole's coming back, and it just might be worse this time.
You see, Fred's also sort of become synonymous with my career at NEiA...he was there literally from day one, we've shared almost all our classes, and I've probably learned more from him about web/graphic design than from all of my other classes combined.  In many ways, he's (most likely unknowingly) been a support keeping me going.  And he's my only friend at my school.  Yes, there's Tristan, but (and no offense to him) he's just not that close, and there's just not the potential for a friendship with him that's on a level even close to Vo or Fred.

I don't mean to belittle my friendship with Vo or Frank by carrying on so much about Fred...perhaps it's the fact that I seriously can believe I won't see him again after this summer semester, whereas I know, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that I'll keep in touch with Vo, and we'll still keep close.  That support, thank the powers that be, has never really been threatened.

I'm just not sure what's going to happen."

Ross: (after thinking for a moment, responds in a completely serious voice)""Mmm...maybe.""

After all the attempts I've been making of having a lucid dream, and remembering/controlling my dreams, I finally become aware, and lose it in one of the situations I most wanted to hang on to.

The day of my birthday...the day that marked the end of my teenage years, also marked the end of the life of the friend I was supposed to carry with me into retirement.  We were supposed to open a bar in Switzerland.  We were supposed to visit Europe.  I was going to show him Capoeira, he was going to show me his breakdancing moves.

Who will force me to branch out, and use new fangled services like Ebay and Paypal?  Who will send me funny websites?

Who did I KNOW, beyond any shadow of a doubt, would always be there.  Who else always, no matter what else in my life occurred, was still online, just a single IM away?  Who did I never lose touch with, never fight with and always trust?  Who understood me, and grew up with me as I entered, and finally, left, those turbulent teenage years?

Who heard my cries against my parents, school, life, and everything else that threatened to close in on me, always, and somehow kept on pulling through for and with me, for ten years?

Yeah, seems so.  I'm not a teenager anymore.  I suppose this is the time to cease my life by the horns, take hold of the reigns, turn the key, take the plunge, etc etc.

All because I'm a day older?

By what may be considered a strange coincidence I finished reading a book today (ie, the 15th) called ""The Science of Changing your Mind"".  I don't need to tell you what it's about.  But I will...it's about breaking out of habits.  Breaking free of your emotions, and taking charge of your life.

The biggest secret?  Don't be afraid of novel experiences.  In other words...not only should you not fear change...you should embrace it.

Interesting that I'd finish a book about change on my last day as a teenager.

Just to add to that, I also finished it on the day I gave my job notice that I'm leaving.  I won't get into my reasons, the list's too long.  Suffice to say, I want a change, and going to school is a perfect time to do so.

I dunno.  The pieces are in place.  Now, do I make the right moves?  Do I win the game?

That way I'll get woken up nice and quick in the morning with a healthy aerobic exercise, then I can finish up at the end of the day with nice, relaxing, centering Tai Chi.

No, if anything, I kind of like it, but more in the way that it's strange and different...something to think about/distract myself.  It seems like my life is becoming more and more surreal, dreamlike.  In particular, my dreams have been bleeding more and more into my real life.  There have been a number a times, not many, but quite a bit considering, when I literally thought something happened, only to later discover it was merely a dream...entire conversations, things happening to my car, etc etc.  And there are times, during the day, when everything seems to get hazy, or...something.  I don't know, things just take on a certain unreal quality to them.

I wonder what causes this?  Will this keep happening, gradually becoming more and more common until my waking life becomes a dream?

Well, I don't know how accurate that is. I just found a website...www.wefeelfine.org  It's a bunch of boucing circles in a window...each circle is a single sentence pulled from people's blogs.  This site grabs upwards of 10,000 sentences that start with the words ""I feel"" and put them into a window.  It touched me.

I've once again falled into the now familiar habit of waiting in anticipation...I'm just trying to live my life until college comes 'round, since I'm not getting the satisfaction I need/want from work, and I'm not really seeing people out of work overly often.  Admittedly, the past two days have been welcome exceptions to this, and I really hope I can get them to continue happening.

At work, I'm torn between a desire to ""move up"" and go work in places that are busier.  There would be an increase of stress, naturally, due to the higher number of people I'd have to serve.  Naturally, there would (hopefully) be a comparable monetary improvement as well.  I just don't know if I really want to deal with the added stress...the money really isn't much of an issue for me right now I guess.

"event","I remember a distance time, now far off in my past.  This was, in my memory, the first major turning point...the first, true, life-altering experience that ultimately defined who I am today.  I can honestly say that no one thing has affected my life to the magnitude of this event, even if  it was spread out over three summers.

I am, of course, speaking of scout camp.  It was during that time that I met James Galloway, my personally adopted mentor (although I'm not really sure if he even knows this...).  From the first day, when I worked as a 14 year old Assistant counselor, I can remember meeting him.  I had a 20 dollar bill, and I was asking around change.  I don't remember why, but I remember something about how he treated me, versus how everyone else approached me actually touched me.  He gave me some degree respect, and believe me, that's something I needed at that time.  Heh, he also gave me some other firsts, and he was my ""gateway"" into another world.

A year later, I returned to camp.  At his invite, I ventured down to the now-infamous Cabin 7...the ""elite"" cabin, the biggest one, complete with its own porch and relative isolation from all the other cabins...a haven, and ultimately probably one of my most comfortable homes, with the entire Onway Forest as my backyard.  In Cabin 7, I took essentially an entire summer's worth (7.5 weeks, to be exact) of punishment...admittedly good-natured, but still, it was verbal harrasment.  To a level I'd never experienced before.  Odd as this may sound, it changed me for the better.  I feel that I grew, became stronger, more secure in myself.  This security...this confidence, would only continue to grow as years passed, but this summer began it.

Naturally, throughout this whole time, I also talked to James.  We philosophized, observed, talked...I learned.  The depth I have, though I feel has always been there, was developed by those talks.  Although there was a lot that was already there, I feel James helped to fully bring it about in me, or helped to unlock the potential.

But on top of all that, the times were wonderful.  There was a sense of carelessness, a sense of freedom I would never experience again, in any capacity.  For the brief time when I lived in those cabins, my life was a collection of trees, my friends, and the campfires.

No worries...truly, I had no worries.  I could forget about my parents, and the looming unhappiness I'd undoubtedly face when I went home every weekend.  There was always the promising allure of Camp Onway...a place where I could be who I wanted (and believe me, I was, for once, completely content with who I was), and I could do what I wanted.  It wasn't a major hassle to work with the scouts, and when I wasn't babysitting boy scouts, I was doing what I wished.

I guess what I'm trying to say is...I was happy there.  And I sort of want those times back."

""We gotta get to a higher place
And we gotta leave by night
Before that river takes us down
We gotta find some place that's dry
We gotta run like we've never run
Or we're gonna lose the light

If we don't get to a higher place and find somebody
Can help somebody, might be nobody no more

Well, I fool myself and I don't know why
I thought we could ride this out
I was up all night making up my mind
But now I've got my doubts
I got my eye on the waterline
Trying to keep my sense of humor

But if we don't get to a higher place and find somebody
Can help somebody, might be nobody no more

We gotta get to a higher place
And I hope we all arrive together
We gotta get to a higher place
If we want to survive the weather

I remember walking with her in town
Her hair was in the wind
I gave her my best kiss
She gave it back again
When I add up what I've left behind
I don't want to lose no more

But if we don't get to a higher place and find somebody
Can help somebody, might be nobody no more""

As he so often does, Tom Petty's song has called out to me, across the feet of space between me and my speakers.  He has an uncanny ability to move me on a purely emotional level, no matter what my current situation in life is.  This is why he'll forever be my favorite musician.  At least, that's why he has thus far.

So, it's summer, about three weeks or so after college.  Crazy times.

I've been incredibly busy...the week after getting back, I went off to work for my dad.  In that week, I experienced a plague of caterpillars, got far better at driving on a highway (in my dad's Baja), and got paid quite a bit.  I also heard a little of my dad's party past, and got to know a bilingual Hispanic man.  It was quite a time.

The following week, I went back to bartending school for a refresher course.  Parts of that were interrupted for what became the following week's occupation...I worked at the Microsoft convention in the Boston Convention and Expo Center, under the illustrious Volt Temp. Agency.  It was a surprisingly good time, truth be told.  I met two cool cats...Mike and Christine.  There's been all sorts of interesting things that have stemmed from that, which most likely won't make it into this journal, unfortunately.  I also met some black girls and went out with them, Ross and some guy who was being all nice and flirty to get into the older girl's pants (a lost battle).  I've yet to see any money from that week, and my last day of work there was this past Friday...exactly one week.

So, for a complete turn around, here's to locked away emotions.  I think I'm going to let this entry switch to ""stream of thought"" writing...for any Jack Keroack (sp?), you'll know just what I mean.

I hate it when situations make it impossible to say what one truly feels...or means.  I don't like people hiding their feelings, or making cop-outs because they're too afraid of what the other will do.  Even moreso, I hate it when I don't know if I'm doing the same.

I don't like not having a way out...a ""cure-all"" for a given situation.

I've been spending the majority of my past two or three days playing City of Villains, which I found a 14 day-trial for.  It's been a grand waste of time...lovely distraction from what otherwise probably could have been crippling boredom.

What's the safest way to unload one's emotions or problems?  Are emo entries the only way?  Seems shitty to me.

I had an interesting conversation at college once...I asked some of my friends about depression.  More specifically, I asked how common it is.  Is it common to be unhappy the majority of the time?  Is it a half and half thing?  Is it more common to spend most of one's time being happy?  It was very interesting to take note of those who said they were unhappy the majority of the time, versus those who said they are happy most of the time.

Another interesting thing...my mom once told me she's always been lonely.  All her life.  Of all the negative things I've heard from adults, all the forcasts of my being poor or whatever from failing out of college, that one statement from my mother shook me the most...all the way to the center of my being.  I've always been lonely, as long as I can remember...it was almost always the driving factor behind my interactions with other people...if not ALWAYS.  Also, the characteristics of my mom that I believe are the causes of her loneliness...seem to be attributes of myself that I hold closest and dearest...things that seem to make a person a ""good"" human being.

While I'm on that subject, virtually every ""good"" human being I've met seems to be almost completely unhappy.  Isn't that something?

My thoughts have come to a major stand still...there's nothing really left now.  My thoughts are just doubling back on what I've already said...well, and one other topic.  One which I don't really feel I can type out here in this entry.  But for the most part, it's all the same.  So, I'll just wait for a little bit, I guess, until more comes.

(10 minutes later)

I'd like to thank Ross, even if he doesn't end up reading this entry, for being the emotional conduit I've needed for a bit now, you really pulled through for me man!

I've realized tonight I still have some major wounds that need to be healed...they can apparently be ripped open quite easily still.

Regardless, I've been left drained.  I don't really have much else to say, as I don't really have much else left to feel.  I'm tired, frustrated...but I have an idea of where to go.  I just need to do it...

"event","Right, so after last night's rather vague entry and abrupt entry, I'll try writing another one.  For whatever reason, a lot of stuff hit me at once yesterday and I wasn't really handling it too well.

Anyway, I'll try to make a better update now.

First and foremost, I am indeed failing out of college.  The work truly has not been that hard (although I am willing to bet it would take quite a bit of time to do the homework), and I know that I am quite capable of doing it.  But I just can't find it in me to force myself to do the work.  Put simply, I just really don't care enough about graduating, I guess.

So, just what have I been doing these past two semester?  Truth be told, not too much.  I got a job working at the convenience store behind my dorm.  Other than that...I've been wasting time in the usual ways.

I've also recently gotten back into contact juggling, and I've always pursued Liquid dancing half-heartedly.

I have a pretty damn cool group of friends up here, if I do say so myself.  We spend the majority of our time hanging around, discussing things around us.  Whether that be a recent observation we made, an interesting fact, or anything else like that, we just like to hang around and talk.  I absolutely love my time with these cool cats and I intend to do everything in my power to keep in touch with them.

Also, I have recently (within the past week or so) finally accepted the fact that I'm really just not a very attractive person at all.  In particular, my clothes seem to really be a huge source of trouble.  I guess since I don't fit into a particular norm, people don't really know how deal with me, and that understandably puts them off.  *shrugs*  I guess the question is this...am I willing to change myself around in the hopes of managing to attract girls?  It's something I've had on my mind lately, and I can't really decide.

Going along with the previous paragraph, I'll restate that I have indeed broken up with Ericka.  Truth be told, it's thrown me for a far harder loop than I've really let on to anyone.  In general, I've been having a hard time finding my own niche, and I'll admit the break up didn't really help with that.  Ah well, I'm working on it.

I also seem to hate AIM now.  For the most part, I'm never on it anymore, and when I am I get frustrated with my inability to communicate well.

In terms of my latest fascination, I've been seriously thinking about the entire concept of ""inner worlds"" and in general mental discipline.  If anyone's interested in hearing more, I guess you can ask me in person, or maybe I'll put it here if you want.

Other than that, for the summer, I intend to get in touch with a few people I've not spoken with for some time, work for my dad during the summer, and hopefully get a place with one or two friends in the Boston area and pursue my future as an elite bartender.

Ultimately, by biggest issue is this: I have no direction.  At all.  I have no real idea where I'm going in life, and I only have the vaguest plan put together.

In other news, one of my newest past times appears to be sitting at a window, watching people walk by below.  For whatever reason, I find I really love it, especially when I see happy people.  Paradoxically, the thing giving me some trouble now still makes me happy when I see it in others...and that's a happy couple.  Sigh.  I sometimes wonder what the significance of this new interest is...am I living my life through the nameless masses that walk by window, taking happiness from theirs and not really making any for myself? What can you do?

I'll admit, I'm scared.  But most of all, I think I'm pretty hopeful.  Cheers.  Hope this update was a little better."

"event","So once again, I find myself turning back to this digital notepad.  It's been an entire school year since I last made an even remotely meaningful update...and so much has changed.  So damn much.

I'm failing out of school...solely because I don't go to class.  Solely because I don't do anything on campus.  I know the work (I've actually recently checked, just for shits), I just don't want to do it.

So, bye bye college.  My time here ended before it ever really began.  It's only in the past few weeks that I've started talking to people...starting getting out, opening up...started actually having a college experience.

As it began, so it shall end...abruptly.

Also, I broke up with Ericka.

My plans for the future?  Work this summer for my dad, then eventually pick up some bartending job in Boston hopefully.  In the mean time, I plan to get a place with a couple friends.

I don't know where my future is bringing me.  I don't know what I want.  I don't know where I'm going.

Yet, all in all, I'd say I'm at least fairly hopeful for the future, both for myself and in terms of humanity in general.

I don't really think there's much else to say.

Thank you for reading, if you did."

Now, admittedly, that's two horrible dream recalls in two days, but I see this as a good sign...at least I remembered something!

"event","Alright, this is entry one of what I hope will become a fairly constant thing in my life, which is my dream journal.  You see, I hope to eventually achieve a number of things involving my subconscious, specifically, lucid dreaming.  This inovlved effectively ""waking-up"" in a dream and siezing control of it.  This is achieved very simply by realizing one is dreaming (typically by noticing out-of-place or unreal things).

However, a crucial aspect of this is, naturally enough, the ability to actually remember my dreams (what's the point in controlling them if I can't remember 'em?), which is otherwise known as ""dream recall"".  That's where this journal comes into play...it will be used to document any dreams I remember, in the hopes that it will be used to document any dreams I remember, ergo improving my dream recall. Anyway, onto the rather disappointing ""entry"" I begin this whole thing with...

I remember absolutely nothing specific, but I do clearly remember trying to perform a ""reality check"" and look around for anything unusual.  However, I'm not sure if it's tied to me actually believing I was dreaming or was simply me practicing.  I also believe there may have been the beeping sounds my speakers make occasionally or the game cytoplasm involved in some way.



So y'all know, that was actually copied directly out of my paper version of this.  I'm hoping that if I keep it documented in two places, it will help cemener the information and speed me along this new road I'm exploring.  Also, maybe some of the few of you who are still here will find it interesting *shrugs*  We'll see how things go, eh?  Take care all."

"event","Welcome back, it's been awhile, I know. Don't expect many more, this is a special occasion.  I want to talk about something...maturity.

I've had an opinion about people for about two years.  Well, specifically, I came to the conclusion that there's no real difference between adults and children, except that adults deal with more money.

I was just being cynical...I swear...

Sadly, after being up at college for two and a half weeks...I've come to the realization that I was right.

People, we have reached college.  We are officially adults, college students.  None of us may really have an idea of what the real world will bring, but we are nevertheless expected to be wiser people than we were in high school.  We're expected to have grown out of the petty rivalries, have gained the ability to shrug things off.  At this point in our lives, we should have developed the ability to think before we act, control our emotions, and act irrationally.

Apparently, this is far too much to ask of some people.

Apparently, we have not grown up.

Now, I know that certain people (assuming they actually take the time to consider this entry, which is probably more than I should expect) will think this is geared specifically at them.  That is not the case.  I'll admit, your actions are what pushed me far enough to write this entry, but this is honestly is quite general.

There are two major things I've noticed, especially as of late.  One is that people are incredibly good at causing drama.  Drama is the ultimate sign of immaturity.  It is caused by people over reacting, not thinking their actions and words through, and being unwilling to communicate.  It is caused by stupid decisions, and it is caused by people allowing themselves to be controlled and influenced by others.

Drama should be basically gone by our college years.

The other thing I've noticed is an unwillingness to take actions to remove one's self from an unfavorable situation.  Although I've noticed this far less, and it's really not ""as"" immature as drama can be, it is still something I have noticed amongst people.  I don't understand it.

Oh well.

Now, if I am right, certain people will over react, they might IM me in anger, probably while I'm away, and bitch me out.  It's also possible that they will completely over react, but not say a word.  At least, not to me.  Instead, they'll talk about it with other people, complain about it.  They'll get angry, they'll bitch about it, and they'll get more and more angry.  It'll spread around, and it will get worse and worse.

Ok, I'll admit, that last paragraph WAS directed at a few specific people.

By the way, on a more personal note, some of you may think I don't know what's going on.  You may believe my opinions of people are based purely on other people, you may believe I was wrong to say what I said.  Well, contrary to what you may believe, I have some clue of what's going on.  I'm well aware of you told me, and I'm also well aware that you are NOT as well informed as you may think.

I live without regrets.  I'm fully aware of my words, and I'm fully aware of what they mean.  And I'm not taking any of it back."

"event","I'm sorry for not updating...I've had more stuff going on in my life than any of you would believe...and I strongly doubt you'd believe that stuff anyway...

I'll try to cover the entire summer, working backwards...I remember emotions better than individual things though, so this may be broken up and unspecific...


The First major thing that's happened to me was my decision to leave.  My relationship with my parents has deteriorated at an ever increasing rate for months now.  It has finally gotten to the point where we literally do not exchange pleasant words...anything we say to each other is strained and awkward.  Or they're yelling at me for some other thing I've managed to fuck up.  So, I decided to leave.  I planned to walk out of the house and live with my friend Jason.  I was going to leave them a note explaining everything...the drugs in my life, the cutting, the pain, anguish, depression, all of it.  All but one thing, which exactly 5 people in my life (who I know personally) know anything about.  The only thing that stopped me in the end was my aunt...she convinced me to wait it out, and live through the last month a half...I broke down that night.  

I've been doing a lot of breaking down lately...friends have been going into depressions left and right, and I've been trying to come to terms with the fact that Vo and I are, seemingly, irrevocably seperating...but I haven't given the friendship the effort I need to give it to revitalize it...There's just so much happening...

As far as Ericka goes, We're still very happy together...there have been some difficult times, but we've made it...we always do...and now I'll be heading to my Love on July 5th...the plane departs at 5:35...2 weeks, 10 hours and 20 minutes.

I've officially run out of money.  I have over 600 in the bank right now, but since I owe my parents over 1000 (plane ticket and phone bills...) it's not actually my money.  I have no job.  My dad has no job.  I hate money.  Fortunately, I'm taking a bartending course, and that makes decent money, so I'm eager to get that job rollin.

Had a scare couple days ago...thought my sister was going through a depression...turned out it was just a sign she made in response to my dad yelling at her for ""wasting money"" when she threw away yogurt she didn't like...*shakes head* she's only 11...he shouldn't do that to her...

My dad's on a power trip ever since he stopped working.

My life is never boring...I actually miss that word...the rare times that I ever feel bored, all I have to do is look out my window...



Well, I guess it's fitting to finish this with a good bye, like I always do...but I'll make this one special.  This is a final good bye to my school friends.  I'm not saying I never want to see you again, but I think it's very realistic to say that I won't.

Mac and Kilks...you guys have been awesome...I hope to hang out at least one more time...I think I'll keep in touch with Kilks through Ericka, but I don't know about Mac...I hope we keep in touch.  Take care out there you guys...you have no idea what might happen, and I wish the best for you.

The rest of you...You guys have been fun...but I just can't invite myself to your get togethers, I need the invite from you...which won't happen.  It saddens me that I probably won't see you, but oh well.  Take care out there.

And...lastly...Vo...sigh.  We've had a good run my friend.  I don't want to admit defeat here, so I won't...but our friendship is dying...has been for probably at least a year...I won't lie, I miss you.  You've done more for me than you will ever begin to know...more than I will ever know.  For that I will always be greatful, and I'll always be there to help you if you want or need it.  You've been a great friend...I hope something changes soon.

Non-school friends...

The Square...Ericka, Vicki and Jay...y'all have been great.  I look forward to many more years together.  We're strong as ever right now...we last through college and we're golden ;-)  We've dealt with a lot of shit together, and we're still strong as ever.  We can do this.

And...Ericka...my perfection...what can I say that hasn't been said a million times before?  I don't need to put in words of hope for the future...or apologies...we love each other, and that is forever...I know we will always be together.


I love you guys


I love you, my beautiful Ericka...

"event","It's official...my journal's dying.  Whereas I used to make updates two or three times a week, you'll now be lucky to see updates two or three times a month from me.  I don't know what it means.  I might be, once again, the shifting winds of change in my life, indicating that it's time to move on from some things.  Indeed, this is a time of change.

On a very broad scale, this is a time of transition as the final years of gradeschool slowly grinds to a jarring, painful stop.  Many people will, hopefully, be moving on to college in the future.  Yeah...hopefully.  But, on a very small scale, today marks a transition of sorts thanks to the rather abrupt shift from living in blissful ignorance of the real world in the arms of my Love to, quite suddenly, being forced to see it all again, and shivering alone on my bed, wracked by pains that can only be soothed by hands far away from here...

Sigh...I just don't have the energy to tell all that I did with her.  Just know that I was completely happy, and that I will NEVER bitch about other people's PDA.  If I have ever done so in the past, or put down teenage love in others, this is my apology for it.  I'm not perfect, and I certainly was not perfect in my past.  Teenage love is a very real, very present thing.  Anyone can have it.  I wish you all the best.  As for PDA...I don't remember how I felt about it, but as far as I'm concerned, I don't care what others do in front of me now.  Period.

Now, one of the most prominent things on my mind tonight is my choice to go to France this June.  I really do not know the full ramifications of that decision.  I know I can deal with anything that happens.  But...I worry.  I may be kicked out of my house.  Even if I'm not, my relationship with my parents will be completely different...very stressed, very...bad.  Worse, it's completely possible I'll lose my job.  However, the single worst thing that may happen is...they may not cover college.  Sigh...looks like I'm taking my mom's original suggestion and taking a year off...unless I truly consider the ROTC...I just don't know.


Don't lie, and don't regret.  Two basic things that seem to be basic guidelines to my life.  If I don't go, I'll regret not spending those three weeks with my Love.  Also, if I don't go, then that means that every time I told her I'd do anything for her...it was a lie.  And I don't lie to my loved ones...especially not Ericka.

Now, I'm off to await my Love's imminent arrival online.  Peace all"

"event","H'ok, so....I've now been an adult for approximately 4 days.  I have to say, my burgeoning adult life has already been fraught with many happenings, both great and small, good and bad.

Friday, my last day of school, was marked by an unexpected early dismissal and an even more surprising early arrival by Jay.  I had one last meal with Paul, then hopped into Jay's car, and we were off!  He wanted to get my birthday present...we went home to pick up Candace, only to discover she had drama and I didn't need to watch her until 3:30.  Well, this gave us plenty of time to head down to AAA...where, after some discussion with cashier (he'd gotten bad information the day before from a receptionis) he picked me up 100 USD worth of Euros.  I was stunned.  All of it is intended to go toward my trip in June to France as spending money...just a little for a couple dinners together with my Love.  Sigh...thanks Jay!

On this day, I also discovered what my birthday/graduation gift is from Vicki...she's going to be giving me as much money as she can to help pay for the tickets to France...once again, a stunningly wonderful gift.  Even if it was 20 bucks, that's still amazing.  Thank you too my friend!

<3


Anyway, I slept over Jay's tonight.  But alas, I am getting ahead of myself.  Friday night, Jay, Julie, PJ (I really hope I'm right there :-/) and myself all went candle pin bowling.  Our original plan was to go laser tagging, but that fell through when we couldn't get Jim to stop playing the Matrix...even after showing up at his house...anyway, that was fun.  Jay and I then snuck back to his house around 11:30ish (his parents never knew we walked in...they sure were surprised the next morning :-P).

The next day was punctuated by a rather surprising turn of events...Vo was apparently on the way to my house...but no one was home...:-/  It was therefore necessary for Jay and I to speed off to my no longer empty house and pick him up.  While we were out, we got Julie.  We returned to Jay's house, played some DDR, then we returned to my house...without my knowing, Jay had arranged for me to get to talk to Ericka...sigh ^_^.

Sunday, the family came over...so I had Pete, Jay and Jim come over.  That gave me an excuse to stay cloistered in my room and not deal with my family (who were surprisingly well behaved...).  Following that, Pete left and Jay, Jim and I took off to buy my gift...a computer game!  Then Jim returned home, Jay and I continued to my house, played said game, then Jay returned to his house.

Yesterday, I spent the day sucking up leaves, then playing my game and talking to my Love and Vicki.  After that, I went to a random party Monty threw, and that was a reasonably good time...some girl named Mariah gave me her number, and that confused me...

In terms of other gifts, I got a new pair of pants, a red shirt, sweat pants, a green shirt and green/white over shirt.  I also got a pair of black velcro shoes (*shrugs*) and a wireless mouse...and an AWESOME zippo!  ^_^

I've also made a rather important decision...I'm going to France in June.  I don't care the consequences, I'm going.  I can stay at Jays, and if I need to pay for college, I'll take out a student loan.  Regardless, I'm going.  (If people wouldn't mind leaving their opinions on the decision, I'd appreciate it)."

John 19: 30

Amen I say to you, I may at last rest in peace, knowing that classes have finally released me from their nefarious clutches.

And, along with the closing of this day, there is also a dawning...for it marks my first day walking this earth as an official adult.  I have crossed over, and now must become bitter and angry at the world.  I must now refer to all young people as whipersnappers or young hooligans, devote my life to a boring, unsuffesfuly job I don't want, and refuse to allow myself to enjoy anything...or not!!


Anyway, classes are done, I'm 18, and I'm teaching myself to hack.  I'm off to wait for my girlfriend, ttfn!

My sister said today ""Jennifer's dad speaks American"".


It's a sad world we live in, where humans coexist happily with other animals, yet can't even communicate peacefully with other humans.


Have you ever felt that there was a really bad mood coming on, and you try to stay busy to stop your mind from thinking and keep ahead of that mood, to fight an uphill battle to escape a feeling of melancholy?  Yeah, me too.


I bought a 3 subject notebook, two pens, and a pocket notebook today.  My plan is to use the three subjects to write down any poems/quotes I like, any song lyrics I like, and any personal musings or thoughts I come up with down in the three subjects.  The pocket notebook is for writing stuff on the fly, then I can transfer them later.  I took Vicki's quote notebook idea and modified it to get this idea.


Jay pointed out to Vicki that one of my greatest pet peeves is misspelling and grammar, especially the AIM language.  I think he's right.

Sigh...I feel lonely.  Not emotionally.  Definitely not emotionally.  I will never feel emotionally alone again, thanks to my Love.  But I do feel alone physically.  Oh well, poor me.  No comments needed.


Emotional pain is so much more potent than physical pain...why do people even bother hitting each other anymore?


Life runs in circles.  All things are circular by nature.  Even natural shapes are, at the very least, curved.  When was the last time you saw a line in nature?  I think that's part of what makes nature so beautiful.


Of course, this circular nature also makes emotions so much more horrible, in my opinion.  Negative emotions feed on themselves and each other, growing worse and worse, until a shining beacon guides us out of it.


Within the Tarot cards, Death represents not an end, but a change.  We can all learn a little something from Tarot cards.


Life, as everyone has heard in various sayings, is but a series of moments, with time spent between waiting.  Each moment a transition to the next.


Given that life is a moment of changes, and a transition is a form of change...we are actually experiencing a death with every new moment...every new experience also another death.  


In reading this entry alone, you've experienced over 10 little deaths.  Interesting, huh?


Drugs are amazing, because they make us see the world as a child sees it...with new eyes, filled with wonder and fascination.  Many times, there's even a hint of fear.  I wonder...are philosophers really so special just because they can, like a child, see the world as one who's never seen anything?


I wonder what my personality, who I AM, would look like if it were represented by an animal, or maybe by a series of pictures or symbols?


An object without time is nothing.  Even in a memory, the object exists, because time is sacrificed to temporarily give it life in that person's mind.


I believe this entry's time is nearly up...thus, this entry's death is imminent.

Peace my friends.
Love eternal for my Love...we will speak soon, my Ericka."

Anyway, big things that have happened...I saw the Ring 2 and I was completely scared, because I get scared unbelievably easily and have a super over active imagination.  Also, last night I slept over Jays (I'm still over there now, truth be told).  We took a ride around 12ish last night, and we were on a long scary road, trading creepy stories from our pasts.  NOT a good time at all.  Ah well, I spent literally the rest of the night watching comedies (I slept from 5-5:30).  No worries, I'll sleep in late tomorrow.  In the mean time, school ends in three weeks.  Yay for that.  Err...yeah...I apparently don't really have anything to post...sooo...I'm out.

The past couple of days, I've had this feeling that there was something very wrong.  I don't know in what way, although I believe that it somehow lies with/in me.  There are things I've felt I needed to tell people...particularly Ericka.  Yet I can't place it.  I don't know what it is.  It confuses me.  On some level, it even scares me a little, I suppose.  *shrugs*  I don't get it.

Anyway, this week has been ok.  I have gone out and hung with Jay almost constantly all week.  I've been talking with Vicki a bunch too, she's a really cool person, and I'm very glad to call her a close friend of mine!

And, of course, there's that one wonderful constant in my life.  Ericka...sigh.  I, unfortunately, have not gotten many opportunities to talk with her this week.  However, May is looking better and better, and I can't wait for that to get here!  In the mean time, I need to start planning for June, and I need to start saving up...I hope I can save enough for the ticket...especially seeing as there's no way in hell my parens will help pay for it.  But it doesn't matter.  I WILL go, and I will be completely happy for over two weeks with my Love.

Also, Vicki, cool gal that she is, invited Ericka and myself to go on her uber woot cool Europe trip next summer!  I cannot wait, and I hope desperately that it works out.  But damn...another trip to pay for...ah well, it looks worthwhile, seeing as we're planning on going to Ireland, Netherlands, Germany, Italy and France.  Sweet!!!

Anyway...back to work I guess :-(  I think I'll be home between 2 and 3...hopefully.  I love all of you!

*cyber hugs to Ericka ^_^*  I love you, and I'll be talking to you later on today...and TALKING to you tomorrow!  Take care, my Love.

P.S: Monday...getting my neck checked out.  The 29th...braces out!!!  YAY

And a reminder...I got into my first choice college!  UMass Amherst, here I come!"

"event","1.What does your LJ nickname mean? 
...it's my name.  Although I actually got the idea from camp, where everyone used my full name when they spoke with me...

2. Elaborate on your icon photo?
Ahh...the first lj icon I ever had.  My wonderful girlfriend cropped it herself just for me.  Wow...that was all the way back before we were together...upwards of 6 months.

3. Did you lie about your age anywhere on the net?
Surprisingly...no.  Oh wait, porn...yes :-/

4. How many LJ friends do you have?
Quite a few...I should slim it down a bit

5. What is your current status?
Happily claimed!

6. What are you wearing right now?
Black pants (with camo lining), socks, black boxers, dark blue Onway shirt, and my pink Ericka-given bracelet.

7. What is life to you?
The time between ""before"" and ""after""

8. What is love to you?
What is love...complete and total devotion to another.  To love someone is to care for them unconditionally...to the point of self-sacrifice.

9. What kind of people do you hate most?
animal killers, the STANDARD jocks/""populars"", and people who are malevolently critical of others.

10.What type of people do you like most?
Fun, good-natured, funny people

11.What makes you happy?
Ericka, my friends, and the aformentioned people being happy.

12.Are you musically inclined?
I've been told I am, but given my lack-of-musical past, I am inclined to disagree.

13.What would you do if you woke up one morning and found out that the person you love most didn't exist or was killed?
I would say take myself out now, but I know that is the last thing she'd want from me...I guess I'd try my best to find a way to go on living a scarred life.

14.If you could go back in time and change ONE thing, what would you change?
I would never have gone to my cousin's two new year's ago.

15.If you MUST be an animal for ONE day, what will you be?
Kitty!!  ^_^

16.Ever had a near death experience?
Not really

17.Name ONE obvious personality quality you have.
good-natured/easy-going/funny (take your pick, I can't decide on one :-P)

18.What's the name of the song that's stuck in your head right now?
Oddly enough, ""Amish Paradise""

19.Are you happy today?
I've been on a serious emotional roller coaster the past 2 or 3 days...mainly content right now

20.Who will cut and paste this first?
good question...I did it to prove that Paul's answer for this question was wrong :-P"

"event","A few quotes for you people, kay?

""He went like one that hath been stunned
And is of sense forlorn;
A sadder and a wiser man,
He rose the morrow morn.""
-the last 4 lines of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, after the Wedding Guest had been told the Mariner's story.

What a world we live in, where aging and becoming wiser also makes you a sadder man person.  Screw growing up, eh?


Ok, a funny one now, from a student in English.  He was talking about how Macbeth didn't want to kill Duncan, but he did anyway because his wife was able to convince him to:

""He wanted to pull out, but he gave into his wife.""

sooooo funny out of context.


I found this on the wall of a room in the basement of the church my troop meets in.  I believe it is yet another indication of how completely pointless religious education is.  There's no way in hell middle schoolers had any clue what they were saying when they answered this question (it was in a child's handwriting):

Why should people still be celebrating the birth of a baby 2000 years later?

-Because it's a celebration about our relationship with the God who made us.
-Until we find that relationship, there will always be something missing in our lives.


Possible future goal: computer virus analyzer

Hmm...it occurs to me that the predominant color I wear during the winter is black...interesting.  Take today for example...my visible clothes are 100% black (except the pink bracelet that I carry always as a small memento of Ericka)...y'all think this is an indication of my color scheme for the summer too?

hmm...time for good byes I suppose

All of my friends...y'all are truly wonderful.  I'm looking forward to hanging out with y'all sometime in the near future...and many more times to come.  :-)

Ericka...sigh...what can I say that I haven't said a thousand times before?  You're wonderful.  That's all there is to it.  You make it worthwhile to wake up in the mornings, I'm thinking of you as I fall asleep each night.  Truth be told, you've also given my life a little structure.  I love you.  :-)"

First and foremost, May is looking up.  So, despite negative stuff (due to my neck mainly), I have been greeted by the wonderful news about May.  My mom finally seems to be loosening up...she's even letting us watch movies together in my room!!  ^_^  Also, for my birthday, she's buying Ericka and I tickets to see the Phantom of the Opera!!!!  How awesome is that?  The only play I've ever wanted to see...and I'm seeing it alone with my Love!!!

Another interesting thing...a whole bunch of stuff is happening around my birthday.  I get out of school the day before...which is the same day that Flogging Molly is playing in RI!!  Yay!!  Also...no more scouts responsibility for me after that day, which is awesome.  It's also the 1/2 month mark before I get to see my Love again.  AND apparently Jay and Vicki have a joined plan for my b-day present...I'm honestly scared >_<

Eagle Project the 2nd and 3rd, Chelsea soldier's home,landscaping, yay

what a pathetic update...>.<

DIE DRAMA DIE!!  :-P"

"event","Well...yeah.  Most of you will already know this, but ok.  About two or three weeks ago, I started feeling a sharp pain in my neck.  This sometimes, but not always, also was accompanied by a head ache.  This culminated last Friday night, when the pain was so bad that I could finally understand the concept of passing out from the pain.  It sucked.  Anyway, I immediately said I needed to see a doctor.  They took my x-rays and said they'd be ready by Monday.  I finally got my results today...sort of.  My mom got a call from the doctors.  There IS something wrong with my neck.  But they didn't say what.  Anyway, I now have an appointment to see the same guy who checked out my wrist, only this time it's about my neck.  Hopefully it's nothing major, right?"

"event","how interesting...the New Year seems to have completely sapped my will to make updates...I've made basically none since Ericka left...strange

Well, I guess I'll try to recap February vacation as well as possible.  Of course, above and beyond all else, there was one blaring problem with it...I wasn't in France.  Since last Summer, I was convinced I would be seeing my Love again during February vacation...only to have that completely dashed by my parents the night Ericka left...one of the hardest nights of my life, in all honesty.

Anyway, with that in mind, I had a fairly good vacation anyway.  I don't remember what I did before Sunday, but I know Sunday I went out to some mall, where I went shopping with Jay, Ryan, PJ, and Jay's wicked cool friend Vicki.  Gotta say, this was a pleasantly fun day, and I truly enjoyed myself...more than I thought I would, given that Ericka was gone, and had been for a day already.  well, I bought a pair of sunglasses (which I already lost), a sunglass cleaning kit, a chili dog, and a tasty ice cream thing.  After that, the whole bunch of us paraded up to Jay's, and we had a sleepover...we watched Dawn of the Dead, which I was characteristically scared by.  Stupid imagination >.<

Anyway, the next day, I went home early and finally got to talk to my Love (both online and on the phone)...I had missed her so much...and I still do...

Anyway, the rest of the week was spent with me working, followed by coming home and talking to Ericka online...and on the phone.  When all is said and done, I talked to Ericka on the phone 3 different times in one week...it was wonderful.  I didn't thank my dad enough for that new phone plan.

just to keep with the pattern:
Anyway, this weekend I went on the father son weekend.  It was ok...the cabin was really hot, because I kick ass at fires ^_^  The next day, we played hockey and football...I didn't really enjoy myself.  During our downtime, I gimped, read my book (Imajica) and talked with everyone...all the while thinking about Ericka...home to more phone with Ericka :-)

Snow day today.  I talked to Ericka all the morning...but now she's gone to hang out with C squared...I really hope she's having a good time...sigh

After Ericka left, Cenzo came over and we discussed DnD (yeah, I'm playing dungeons and dragons...make fun of me if you want :-P) and played a little DDR.  Then he left around 5 and I went to the book store with Mac, then to Ross's and then home.  Now I'm updating and just trying to distract myself...anything to pass the time.

Big events:
Eagle Project...late March/early April
Mid April...end of classes
----> First week of May...Ericka comes ^_^ <-----
May 6...Prom
Second week of May...end of Christian Service/graduation/freedom
----> Mid June...I'm off to France for as long as nearly an entire month!!! <----


Oh yeah, I have a wrist brace.

Hopefully Braces off tomorrow...then talk to Ericka...then to the Flogging Molly concert hopefully.

Ok...I'm out.

Fuck it. Life moves on.
I feel like I meant nothing.
School, work, friends
You can't shut out everything
To keep a special someone on the pedastal forever.
It isn't normal, it isn't healthy.
Things fade over time
They never stay the way they begin.
How can you be happy with someone
If you can't bring yourself happiness?
Lately as life moves along
I'm accomplishing some of my biggest goals
New job, almost done with school, finally have decent grades.
To much time being ridiculed
Instead of looking for understanding.
Does it matter if the paths are different
If the destination is the same?
Was I good enough?
What a stupid fucking question.
Absolutly."

My smile will not mislead you,
Cause I've been alone,
And my faith turned to stone,
Still there's something in you,
I believe in,
Close to the pierce,
I go wild and fierce,
Still I let you be,
I feel you next to me,
'Cause outside I feel,
A wind it starts to blow,
I'm taken in your undertow.
Everything is fine...
But I'm lonely all the time,
All I want to do is be there,
For the things that you're going through,
Is that good for you?
Is that good for you?
You haunt my nights when,
I don't know where my life should go,
Is that good for you,
Hey child please stay awhile,
My smile will not mislead you,
And roll me out,
I go wild with doubt,
I grab at you,
I can't stop grabbing at you,
Cause I feel you cross my mind in disarray,
Intoxicated ricochet,
There's nothing wrong
Just don't take too long,
All I want to do is be there,
For the things that you're going through,
Is that good for you?
Is that good for you?
You haunt my nights when I don't know where my life should go,

rough and tumble, ready for anything. You call the shots and go your

You are emotionally stable and willing to find common ground with others.

Your friends and family often look to you to be the mediator when there is conflict.

You are easy going and accepting. You take things as they come.

Avoding conflict at all costs, you're content when things are calm.

"event","Cradle was fucking awesome!

Maleficent in dusky rose
Gathered satin lapped Her breasts
Like blood upon the snow
A tourniquet of Topaz
Glistened at Her throat
Awakening, pulled from the tomb
Her spirit freed eclipsed the moon
That She outshone as a fallen star
A regal ornament from a far flung nebular

Her likeness hung in the black gallery
Commanding unease
Demanding of Death to breathe...

Midst the whirl and daylight fauna
Of society at court
Elizabeth bedazzled, Her presence sought applause
Though Her torchlit shadow
Thrown upon damp cellar walls
Greeted nothing but despair from slaves Her nights enthralled

Thirteen Winter solstices had shown
Her path, that the dark
Had marked its dominion
Spaying the confessor
Whose caresses she'd known,
As whipcord in the House of Dog
Her cold cunt meat on holy bone

Raped of faith, She now embraced
The narcissistic unrest frozen on the mirror's face
With this disdain, inside these veins
(Highborn wanton that She was)
She sought to keep what age would claim
Her soul was sold and for this toll
Reeking pyres ever smouldered
On the whims of one so in control
Elizabeth, mysterious.
Cruelty brought thee orchids
From the bowels of the abyss

Once upon atrocity when midwitches stifled cries
And carved abortive runes in reddened wombs
Exhumed by scrying eyes
Madness came upon
Her like an amourous lover's seed
Lifesblood splashed upon Her skin
In gouts torture unleashed

And to Her dead reflection
Twas as if Her pallor gleamed
Like an angel's warmed by candles
Where erotic stains had cleaved
So demons dragged this libertine
Lusts screaming for release
Upon the flesh of maidens preened
As canvas for caprice

Exacting obeisance
Her gaze held a seance
Of spirits too trapped under glass to commune
A sleeter mistress than Luna
Whose threats to consume Her
Met with torments giving vent to Her swoon

Flat on Her back
Pack-prey for the reams
Of verses and curses
That haunted Her dreams
Midnightmare chimed
Thirteen in Her mind
A disciple of scars
Branded years hissed behind
Ridden split-thighed
By the Father of lies
An ovation of wolves
Blushed the skies as they writhed

But Heaven is never forever
She came, a spent storm
From the clouds...

Leaving serpents in office
Inside every gate
To lick righteous holes
Blinding Lords to the fate
Of virgins forced naked
To defile on rent knees
Hacked and racked backwards
Menses choking their pleas

""More. Whore. More.
Twitching make me wet with thee
Carcass rub me raw""

And to Her dead reflection
Twas as if Her pallor gleamed
Like an angel's warmed by candles
Where erotic stains had cleaved
So demons dragged this libertine
Lusts screaming for release
Upon the flesh of maidens preened
As canvas for caprice

Cruelty and the Beast!

Raped of faith, She now embraced
The narcissistic unrest frozen on the mirror's face
With this disdain, inside these veins
(Highborn wanton that She was)
She sought to keep what age would claim
Her soul was sold and for this toll
Reeking pyres ever smouldered
On the whims of one so in control
Elizabeth, mysterious.
Cruelty brought thee orchids
From the bowels of the abyss

"event","Today I was sitting in my Economics class, and the teacher told us the test was going to be next Monday.  Then some girl raised her hand and complained that we shouldn't have a test on a Monday after fall break because it isn't fair to the students because they will be having fun on their fall break and won't have time to study.  Now to most people this would sound like a fantastic idea, but I already have a test on Wednesday, so now I have two, because some stupid girl didn't want her weekend affected with having to learn.  I didn't think the teacher would do anything it except look at her like she was the dumbest person in the universe, but no, because one person didn't want to have their weekend spoiled by school, he gave in and changed the test date. 

Meanwhile, Joe Nathan finally brought his lunch today.  It only took 3 weeks but he did, and it was fun.  Everyone should bring their lunch to school, it is the COOLEST!

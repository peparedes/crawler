"event","Time just passes whether or not you want it to.  Take every moment and treasure it like you would treasure your last piece of chocolate.  No one knows what is in store for us but us.  Don't expect other people to give you answers... go out and find them for yourself.  The only person that you can turn to besides yourself is God.  He also knows what is in store for you, but he isn't going to tell you, because he wants you to figure it out for yourself!  Just like when something goes wrong... it doesn't mean that he isn't there beside you it just means that he decided to let you walk a few steps ahead of him.  Just  like when you were little, you tried and tried to walk.  Even though you fell, your parents didn't always coming running to your side, they let you try to stand back up on your own and try it again.  But if you were to go close to the stairs and they were afraid that you were going to fall down the stairs they would pick you up and put you in a place where you would be safer to walk.  God lets you walk all on your own, when you fall he wants you to be able to get up dust yourself off, get up and try to start all over.  As soon as you get to the stairs he will pick you up and put you back to where you started or maybe even another place you didn't expect.  God is full of surprises.  One time he might pick you up when you fall and the next time he will make you get up on your won.  Just because he isn't always there to pick you up and dust you off and send you on your way doesn't mean that he isn't there cheering you on, to get up on your own.  
I've taken this theory for granted, I expect that every time I do something wrong, or fall that God isn't there.  I have realized that he has always been there, pushing me towards my goal.  Even though I don't know what that goal is or when I will achieve it.  He wants you to learn from your mistakes, not only to teach yourself but also to sometimes teach others, so they too don't feel alone in the world.
Sometimes when I am alone, that is usually the time where I have fallen.  I think what did I do to deserve this... I think that if there was a God what did I do so bad to deserve this.  Then I tell myself to look back at all the good things that God has given me and it makes me stick it out and wait for the outcome.  The outcome always has it's advantages good and bad.
Quite often I find myself wondering, if I have made the best decisions that I could have made?  I find myself thinking, why now?  I find myself feeling sorry for myself.  I find myself thinking why do I care so much when they don't care?  I find myself wondering why do I always put myself on the edge, just to let them push me off?  I find myself acting like a mother when I am just an adult.  I find myself thinking of crying for no reason.  I find myself wanting to say I don't care.  I find myself wanting to say so what's the big deal.
Those are just some of my weaknesses.  God knows that and that is what he uses to test me, I have become a lot better at handling things that are of this nature.  By next year I will have overcome most of my weaknesses and will have new ones to replace the old one, God will then test me on those so that I can over come them also.
I just wanted to let you know this is how I feel, I put my feelings on display.  I hope that you will cherish my opinion, and treat it as if it were yours.  Please tonight just before you go to bed think about your weaknesses, and how God is always there pushing you even though you fall he will always be there to get you just before you fall down the stairs."

But that night, I think we knew it was time to let go of what had been, and look ahead to what would be. Other days. New days. Days to come. The thing is, we didn't have to hate each other for getting older. We just had to forgive ourselves...for growing up.""

Tuesday, after rehearsal... Davone' and I kidnapped Krystle.  We were just going to go on Buffalo Ridge... but the trip went elsewhere.  We wanted to see how long rt. 50 west was.  Well we only made it to Historical North Vernon.  There were so many cool houses along the road, also some nasty pianos outside this one store.  When we turned around I thought that I saw a doggie on the side of the road... when we turned around there was nothing there... but where we turned around there were these 3 crosses... they looked like they belonged in the movie ""children of the corn"" scared us to death!  I ended up getting home at like 3:30am.
The next night we decided to see how long it would take us to travel all around I275.  It ended up being 83 miles and took us 1 hour 14 min and 2.9 seconds!  :) :)  Now you know.  We have no idea what our next drive will take us.  We were thinking of trying 50 east but we haven't made up our minds.
Work stinks... the play is getting better, I have a 2 word solo!  LOL!!  Well I am heading to bed.  I have to wash off the make-up I put on tonight... we got to dress up for work... I had this cool make-up on that made me look frozen!  After that I am off to dream land!  I hear mr. sandman calling my name!"

""it's all about tough love... just ask your parents"" - something I have learned growing up but didn't realize till just recently.
Parents always seem to know what to do and what to say to make your day, sometimes they may be tough, and stand their ground... but they only do it to help us be stronger more individual adults.  My parents have always loved me, sometimes it doesn't feel like it, but those are the times when they love me the most and they just want what is best for me.  Just remember that the next time you get into a fight with your parents... they are doing it for you!!"

How weird... well I called and left a message on the answering machine of the guy I like... but I didn't leave a phone number... DUHHH.  Oh well it gives him a chance to take in all the glories of me!  lol!!  I crack myself up sometimes... got to go get ready for rehearsal!"

This excites me very much knowing that he is well enough to come home, I know that this makes him happy too!  I got my birthday wish, even though it still isn't my birthday.  I prayed and wished so hard that they knew... I needed this to happen and so did my grandpa.
Today was the first day of the Mount Saint Joe rehearsal for the show they are doing.  I arrived today thinking that I was going to have a pretty decent part... and I got crap!!  My mother would like for me to quit... but a show is a show right?  I miss being on the stage and acting, singing and dancing.  I was not the only person who was upset by this... there were many.  I don't even get a duo or anything... here I am in the chorus again.  If I am to make the show at Covedale... I don't care if I am in the chorus or not... I know that this is a good production and people love tim perrino's work!  Maybe I am just being selfish (I guess that is the word that I am looking for), but I know that I deserve better than this.  I also found out tonight that the guy that I think is a total cutie, sweetheart, and funny... HAS A GIRLFRIEND!! ughhhh either taken, gay or an ass!!  I will find someone!!  That is my goal, well actually I shouldn't make it a goal... cause I am in no hurry to settle down!  But I am keeping my options open!"

"event","I just woke up from one of the weirdest, nightmares...
I don't remember how it really started all I know is that there were three of us down in my basement, there was a boy and a girl. But from what I remember the girl came in my dream later.  I turned on the downstairs light and the boy turned it off, with his magical powers... I asked him to turn them on again.  So he listened and he turned them on again.  We were downstairs together when he started acting funny... he was possessed by something/someone.  Then he disappeared and the girl appeared out of nowhere... then the next thing I remember was the girl having a gun and I had two knifes...  the girl was talking all weird.  She then pulled the gun on me and it was kind of like the matrix in the fact that I dodged the bullet... she then shot again and it braised my shoulder my right shoulder.  I then threw one of the knifes at her and it hit her right in the middle of her chest... she tried to attack me again but I some how ended up chopping her up in to pieces and putting her into  a rubber-maid box, that had four lips to the top to close it... I began to chop her up and I heard the front door open it was my father with a drunken friend... this drunken friend was a movie star of some sort... I don't know the movie star's name.. but in my dream he was a friend of my fathers... I told my father to not breath because the bad thing that was possessing my friend downstairs was about to try to find another host... well we stopped breathing, but his friend didn't and ended up getting possessed by it.  For some odd reason my dad knew the whole story, and was like great now we have to kill someone else.  Then I see my brother and his girlfriend on the couch making out... I don't know if dad saw them or not... but they were getting pretty hot and heavy.  I then brought up the box from downstairs and my father and I were trying to decide on how to kill the guy.  I looked out the door and there was something weird cause the cars seemed huge!  Outside was my dad's van, my little escort, and the guys SUV of somesort... I came back inside and looked at the man that we put in our kitchen... and I woke up.
I guess the reason that this dream bothered me so much is... I knew the girl, but I am not going to give her name away on the internet.  Why was I killing people?  Why was this dream like 2 different movies put into 1 (thinner and matrix)?  WHERE WAS MY MOTHER??
If any of you are good at making out what dreams mean... please let me know that I am not crazy and there was a reason to this strange odd dream!!"

Tonight I auditioned for the Mount Saint Joe play... hopefully I will get a good part.  I am very excited to see what I end up getting, auditions are also tomorrow and I am going back to sing a different song... I didn't know that we were aloud to bring our own pieces... in the past she supplies the song... well we sang amazing grace, which wasn't bad... but I would like a different song to show off my range a little better, something that I know.  It will be a little hard to pull out of my butt for the auditions tomorrow.
Tonight I went over to a friends house and I felt totally out of place.  They both had someone... I felt like the 5th wheel... (I love that show!).  I didn't want to say anything there... but they had to have known that I felt out of place... it would be a different story if I even had someone and they weren't there... but I don't have anyone.  I know that i shouldn't complain... I have had a lot of opportunities to get with someone.  I blew them all away.  I don't know, I can't find anyone that fits my standards.  When I think that I have found them, they end up all ready taken, they are gay, or they don't even know that I am alive!  I don't mean to be complaining... cause I know that is what I am doing, sorry to those of you that are reading this and telling me to get a life...  :)  I hope that I do find someone... i mean when my mother was my age, she had already married my father.  Okay... I think I am done Good night!!

"event","Today is the 2 year anniversary of September 11... can you believe that it has been 2 years already.  Sometimes it feels like it just happened.  I know that a lot of people are scared that something is going to happen, I am praying that they are wrong.  I have come to the conclusion that September 11 should be a national holiday.  They have a presidents day, a veteran's day, a memorial day... I think that September should also have it's day, I mean no one will forget that tragic day.  I still remember the day like it was yesterday, I was in Concert Choir class and Mr. Welsh came in... then Mrs. Hill turned on the tv.  Little did we know that it was going to happen twice cause we only saw the aftermath of the first hit.  I saw a special on tv yesterday about how they thought that the building could have been built better to withstand something like that.  The man that designed the twin towers was on the show, and I don't think he really agreed. My brother said an interesting comment he said ""If I was that guy I would blame myself everyday for those towers falling...""  In my opinion that man designed them the best way he knew how at the time... how was he supposed to know that some years later that some damn terrorists were going to run airplanes into them.  At that time the twin towers were above and beyond that day.  He used state of the art technology. I don't know, they can say whatever they want to say... I will say that the man who built them was pretty damn smart cause they stayed up a lot longer than I would have expected!
Okay, it isn't much longer until my birthday. I know what a weird way to switch subjects... I just didn't know how to do it... so I decided to make it about me!  lol.  Selfish huh??  14 days until I am 20!  I know it isn't that big of a deal it's not like it is one of the big ones.  But my friend Krystle pointed out to me... my age is no longer going to have a ""teen"" in it, which excites me!  My girl Lindsey's b-day is on friday!!  It is party time!  Last night Lindsey introduced me to a really cute guy friend... that plays soccer!!  He is sooo going to be at the party, YAHOO!!  As for the guys in my life... ummm... there is really none.  I love the single life cause I can flirt with who I want, where I want, and when I want!  Life is great right now.  I am trying to look for another job, since PKI is only open on Weekends right now and will be closing Nov. 2.  **Funny story** Krystle, Davone and I were going through the taco bell drive-thru when we got to the window the woman asked if any of us were looking for a job, because everyone at her work is getting arrested!!  She was offering us jobs through the drive-thru... i was supposed to go in a few days ago to fill out an application, I just haven't brought myself to it.  I want the job... but I told myself... NO FAST FOOD!  Oh well you got to do what you got to do!  Well that is long enough for me... I most likely put you to sleep... So adieu!"

Hopefully everything goes to plan tomorrow... if they do I will finally have my background check done and begin working at PKI, I will go to OHHS and get my transcript sent to UC, get my application in and enroll, and hopefully clean my room.  I am so excited that my great buddy that I met in Florida who lives in Wisconsin named Matt is comming to visit in like 3 weeks.  I have that long to finish cleaning, get a bed and decorate!  Wish me luck!  If you know me at all you know that my bedroom is a mess!!  It sucks even worse that Steve (my brother) and I are switching rooms!!  UGHHH  Oh well I love each and everyone of you!  I am also glad that Krystle is back in town!!  I hope her trip went well!!  Peace and love to everyone!"

"event","Not sure what to think of my life right now.  I am single, but yet there are options of guys to become a boyfriend... but why am I not taking them?  I kind of like playing the field, but in a way I feel like I am betraying all of them.  I know that most of them don't want a serious relationship, and that is great.  But sometimes I want that step farther, and sometimes I thank my lucky stars.  I mean what kind of girl would complain that she has too much.  I am scared to just jump into that next step... this guy that I used to hang out with in high school just got engaged.  My friends are getting PG.  So now, I am wondering is it me that is taking this weird or are they.  I mean I want to be out of College and have a steady job before I get married and have kids.  I don't want to work at some joint for the rest of my life... I have goals and I don't want anybody standing in my way and telling me no, or stop or cool.  I don't know if that makes any sense but in my head it makes perfect sense.  I went to my first Keg party... and I was the DD.  I don't find much enjoyment in drinking anymore.  I like knowing what the hell I am doing!!  I saw so many people that I knew, I didn't think that I would know anybody.  I saw the guy that I had a crush on in 9th grade.  He saw me and was like... wow... how are you??  Wouldn't expect to see you here.  Then he got my phone number and he is going to call me.  I am running into a lot of guys that I used to have crushes on... it is great.  I just wish that I could find my real self instead of walking around trying to be something I'm not... but I don't know if I am myself and I don't know it.  I am confused.  Wow i better go before I confuse myself any more!!"

Even though I dearly miss my friends at Disney, sometimes I wish I was back in Florida soaking up the sun.  Todd is the coolest guy I know, and I can't wait to send him his be-lated birthday present... I hope that he will like it.  I am making him a frame with a bunch of pictures of me, Kevin, Allison and him.  All 4 of us were unseperable.  I hope I will get to go and visit him soon.  My buddy Chris now has a condo in Daytona and he said that I have to come down and visit... I mean who is going to turn that down, he can see the beach from his window!  My friend Shana is about to pop out her baby boy.  She is going to be a good mother.  I just got a job at Paramount's Kings Island as a guest relations Associate!!  I am so pumped!  I have given myself troubles in my life, but I know that God is there to see me through this.  I wanted this job so bad and I got it!  Yet again he has opened this door for me!  He has and always will be there for me opening and shutting doors, he knows what is good for me and what isn't.  My parents are great, I mean they give me crap sometimes... but they wouldn't be parents if they didn't do that once in a while.  I need to get my act together and call UC and get that done.  I am glad to be home though, my friends, my family and most of all my church is here.  I will always have the memories of Florida!"

"event","So many things have happened since I last wrote in my journal.  I got terminated on Monday, from Walt Disney World.  Terminated is such a harsh word.  I don't know why they use it but they do.  My termination from disney was my own stupidty.  I was late too many times and I was sick to much.  Sick meaning, that I couldn't go to work because I dreaded my time there... and I couldn't drag myself out of bed to go to work where they would treat me like I was nothing and didn't let me speak my mind.  They basically told us what to do, sometimes it even felt like they told me when to breathe.  I know that sounds stupid, but that is how I felt, and it is still how I feel.  I wish I just would have delt with it and got my lazy ass out of bed and went to work or else I wouldn't be in this situation.  So I have to say goodbye, before I am even ready... I was supposed to have another 1 1/2 months down here and it has been cut down to 1 1/2 weeks.  That isn't enough time to say goodbye like I would like to.  I sometimes wish I could tell people how I truly feel... but now I am kind of glad I didn't cause it might have made leaving even harder that what it is now.  Both of them are very happy the way they are now, so I know I made the right decision... even though sometimes it hurts to see them.  Tomorrow might be the last time I get to talk to Warren... and I don't know how I am going to handle it... I am so upset right now that I can't sleep and I feel like I am going to get sick.  I pray that God had this happen to me for a reason... maybe he did it to wake me up and say CRYSTAL... STOP BEING LAZY AND DO WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.  Disney has been a lesson that I will never forget as long as I shall live.  It has made me happy, sad, mad, depressed, pissed, and all kinds of other emotions.
As for home, I want to go back, but yet I am scared.  There is too much stuff that I have missed and I don't want to be left out... but it's going to happen sooner or later.  I love it at home but there is too much emotional baggage back home.  Hopefully I will get it all straightened out and let it be the way it was.  Everything happens for a reason... and hopefully I will know why soon enough"

"event","Today my friends are leaving me.  There is only a hand full of friends that I will still have down here with me in this hell hole!!  I don't want to say good bye, but you know that it has to happen.  Why do you make friends when they are just going to leave.  If I didn't make friends like the friends that I have made down here I don't know where I would be right now.  But honestly, it's very hard to say goodbye.  People say that they will keep in touch, but you know they are just saying it to make you happy.  I wish some people weren't fake.  My roomates came home from the cruise today and they got in to an arguement with one of the other roomates that didn't go.  They were friends, or at least they said they were but they talked about the other one behind their backs and finally they snapped.  the one roomate left today upset with the other one.  The one tried to appologize, but the other one wouldn't listen!  How shitty.  Why would you leave a friendship like that!  I didn't get to say goodbye to my good friend Adam, he just up and left with nothing to say.  I wasn't even here to get my last hug from him...  I know that he is gay, but i love him dearly!  I am glad that I still have Allison, my old roomates, besides the two crazy ones, Todd and especially WARREN.  I would be lost with out him.  Pray that Justin gets the internship down here in Dayton, then I will have all my guys here, right by myside.  Justin went bear hunting with his grandpa... he will be gone for a week.  If he catches something, I will not look at it.  I hate fur!!!!!!!!  I am going home for a visit and maybe that will get my mind off of all of my friends leaving.  I will miss Matt alot, he has gotten to be one of the sweetest guys I know.  He holds a special place in my heart along with all of my other friends that are leaving.  I hope that they all have a fun safe trip home.  I WILL LOVE AND MISS YOU ALL DISNEY FRIENDS"

"event","I love having random days off.  I am up at 4:00 am and I don't care!! la la.  Even though my body is telling me to go to bed.  Aren't my friends great!!  I love them to death.  I have had a good week.  Allison, Todd, Kevin and I went on a road trip at 12:30 at night to Clearwater (which is about 22 miles away from Tampa) We got there and just walked around the beach, collecting sea shells.  They are just so darn pretty.  We didn't get back home until 6:00 am.  It was supposed to be a night to go putt putting but everything was closed so we were driving and I was like... Tampa or Daytona... and Tampa was the choice!!  yahoo.  Later Allison, Todd and I went back on Monday so that Allison could cut her hair ten inches and give it to Locks of Love.  It was so sad watching all of that beautiful hair go... but it was for a good cause.  Then we went to the beach again and got more sea shells.  We drove for forever trying to find south beach, I think we ended up passing it and we ended up at Treasure Island, which is fine... it was a cute little town.  They have ruined the beaches by putting hotels up all around it, I mean I would love to drive down the street and see the beach but oh yeah I can't cause all the damn hotels are in the way... rarrrrrrrrr.  Guess we can't have everything we want.  My roomie is snoring!!! lol sorry that was a random comment, but I think it is soooo funny.  Allison has to get up in 2 hours and go to work and I haven't even gone to bed yet.  ha ha.  We dyed Allison's hair today it is dark brown, it is very pretty.  OMG I was at work and my left I was bothering me, I had my contacts in and it started to hurt.  Usually the pain goes away in like 15 min, but this pain didn't stop.  My eye was watering like Niagra Falls, everyone was staring at me and looking.  I guess they thought I was crying... but I wasn't.  I should have told them, yeah disney really does suck... DON'T COME BACK! !! Just kidding.  So I walked back to the main building where we check and Linda told me it might be better to take out the contact.  So I did, and for those of you that know I am soooo blind with out my contacts or glasses.  So I called my roomates and asked them if they could bring me up my glasses and they did but not until like an hour later.  That is okay though, I tried to do things that I could do with out seeing... it was so funny I looked like such a dork.  I couldn't walk down the stairs in the ampatheater or else I would fall on my ass, so I had to use the handicapped ramp on the side.  My manager Dennis asked me if I wanted to go home... I said I would if I knew how to drive without seeing... he didn't laugh.  Oh well.  So now I have to wear my glasses until I figure out what the hell is going on with my eye.  Tonight one of my roomates called and complained about the girls being loud upstairs... I mean sometimes they can be a little loud, but it is normal.  We all walk, sometimes and some people walk heavier than others.  Our celing and their floor is like paper thin.  I don't know I just know that I wouldn't call security on them I would call and talk to them and let them know that they are being loud.  I don't know that is just me... well I think that I should be heading to bed... GOODNIGHT... PEACE"

I have found the coolest adventure buddy. i am glad that I met Crystal and she is my new adventuring friend. So to anyone who reads this. ""the Incredible Elmo"" says hello. Oh yeah the mighty pigeons will rule the world and it was Kernel Mustard in the kitchen with the SPAM. Ok and Crystal, we will always have TOY STORY"

"event","Star light, Star bright... first star I see tonight, I wish I may and I wish I might have this wish I wish tonight.  I wish... to see my family.  This great and wonderful world of Disney is getting to be a little too much.  I have the option of going home in May, but I am not going to go.  I have never given up on anything before and I am not planning on starting now.  I have been listening to my ""Follow that Bird"" soundtrack and singing ""one little star""... that is my favorite song, it reminds me of home so very much.  We used to listen to that soundtrack when we would clean the house, we would put it in the tape player and blare it... then we would go around the house singing and cleaning... I am so tired I am going to bed... nighty night!"

"event","Warren is wonderful... he is super!!  He is super warren!  lol.  I love his wonderful Apple Cranberry drinks!  yum yum, I could drink them all day long!  He won't let me though.  He is afraid that I would be in a coma... forever!  lol
Okay enough about Warren.  Today was a cool day, I worked fantasmic and it was a really good night... not to hot and not to cold.  I wanted to be on a specialty tray but NO, I got on a register and had to count out the hard way... I had to count the drawer like 4 times... I HATE TO COUNT!! lol.  This little girl today her name was Katie she was about 7 had a little sister named Mary who was about 4.  Well the mom only really had enough to get one thing for the girls to share... so she bought them mickey mits.  Well the mom said to both of them you only get one to play with... Mary got upset about that... and with out any hesitation... Katie gave hers up and put it on Mary's hand.  She reminded me of me when I was young... always looking out for the young one.  So I took a pin off my lanyard of the Princesses... and I turned to Katie and told her what a wonderful little girl she was, and I handed her the pin.  She looked at me so confused.  I said Katie this pin is for you, for being one of the greatest little girls I know.  I told her never to stop looking out for her little sister... and I thanked her for being the wonderful sister she was.  She just smiled.  I almost started to cry.  I miss my little brother, I know he isn't little any more.  I missed his 16th birthday, and I missed his face when he passed his drivers test THE FIRST TIME!  I am missing out on my brothers happiness.  I will never stop loving him, he is the greatest little brother that any girl could ever have... he is my best friend and I will never ever forget him as long as I shall live... and I know he feels the same way.  I miss our talks at 3 in the morning, him telling me all the friend and girlfriend problems he is having and I love to help him out as much as I can.
I miss talking to Justin, we never get to talk like we used to... I miss it so much.  I never thought I would miss talking on the phone so much.  I hoped to get a response to the email I wrote him, but there was nothing.  It is okay though, right now we are just friends... but honestly I hope it turns in to something more. I don't know what I am going to do while he is gone for a week in Mexico.
I am going to head to bed... I have to work in the morning.  I miss my family, my friends, and Justin.  Thanks for listening to my rabble"

Being here always makes me happy.  I would be even more happy if I could talk to Justin.  Actually life would be perfect if he would call or talk to me online.  Friends are making my life better.  I am starting to talk to Krystle again.  I had a really bad nightmare about her... and now I feel better knowing that she is okay.  She has a boyfriend that is having some problems right now, so if you could pray for him that would be great!  Thank you all very much.  I love to hear from all of my friends it makes me feel so much better.  I talked to my brother just last night and it was so great.  I love him so much!!!!  He is the greatest little brother any girl could ask for.  Well I am going to go I am going to watch a movie with my grandparents!!! love ya guys!"

Girl when we started baby we were friends 
But that's not how this fairy tale is gonna end 
See I was thinking then it clicked one day 
That no one else has ever made me feel this way 
The next time I saw you girl I knew I had to try 
To tell you everything that I was feeling deep inside 
And listen good cause what I say is from my heart 
So if you're ready

You see I toss and turn when I'm alone 
And I just cant wait til you get home 
Waiting for your call cause tonight we're gonna do it all 
Girl it's just the two of us 
Cause I'm thinking about you day and night 
And I just can't get you off my mind 
When you get a minute baby I was thinking we could hook up 
It's just the two of us, the two of us 

Cause in a room full of people you're the only one around 
And nothing in this world could ever bring us down 
Baby I'll be there telling you I care 
This I swear 
Girl its just the two of us, the two of us

Baby I wonder if you feel the same as I do 
I wonder if you're going through the things I'm going through...
I sent you flowers on a Saturday
and inside's a letter with a message and no name
See I just love the feeling, knowing I can make you smile
and I haven't felt that about someone in quite a while
Just listen to these words I have to say
Just take a chance..

You see I toss and turn when I'm alone 
And I just cant wait til you get home 
Waiting for your call cause tonight we're gonna do it all 
Girl it's just the two of us

It just gets better with each day (baby someday)
I always wanted to tell you
But I was so afraid

I mean instead of it being a girl its a guy... but I know he feels the same.  I can't get him off my mind, tonight when I got off the phone with him.. I cried, it wasn't tears of sadness... they were tears of happiness... I haven't felt that way about a guy at all before.  I can not wait until I check my email, or he calls me... its a feeling that is great.  He makes me smile so much.  He means a lot to me... Thank you Justin"

"event","Can you believe that I am in the happiest place on earth... and I am not that happy.  I miss my family I miss my friends.  My roomates here have became my new best friends.  My one roomate reminds me of my cousin and we are never apart.  I am working at MGM studios.  I guess you could call that fun. I mean I am in the best park, in the best area of the park, I work at Tower of terror, Rockin' roller coaster, and Fantasmic.  How could someone ask for a better job.  I love it here... if i wasn't so home sick.  I am just a family girl.  I hope that I will get over this home sick thing, I don't want to live with my parents all my life.  I mean hello... who does??  I love being able to get into the parks for free.  I am usually there on my days off and if I am not there... I am in a coma (according to warren).  i have to admit that I love to sleep.  Who doesn't??
Right now I am very confused... I like this guy, but i am not quite sure if he likes me back... plus i don't know if it will work out.  I love talking to him... I could talk to him for forever... and I think he feels the same way but I am not sure.  i don't want to be like... hey I like you and then he is like... oh i like you as a friend.  I don't know if the relationship would last... i mean we are so far away... we could see each other.  I would love to see what happens if I go back home... I don't know.  I am rambling on about stupid shit!! lol  I need to get off one of my roomies needs to get on and I am running out of things to talk about.  Hope to write back sooner rather than later! lol"

"event","I GIVE UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can't stand people anymore... esp. people who say they are your friends and then they dick you over.  Why are people like this.  I never was... mean I sometimes made mistakes but then I appoligize... They act like they did nothing wrong... that is what really hurts my feelings. I just want my mom, I want her to hold me.  Tell me everything is okay I guess this is what freshman in college call homesick...
My mom wrote me an email the other day... it mean't so much to me... I can't believe that I was so mean to her when she was here.. she just wanted me to be organized.  I need her so bad right now.  I need her to tell me I screwed up again... that I should have never thought that I was part of them again, I need her to give me a slap in the face and tell me to stop crying.  I need her to tell me not to hang out with them any more... even though we all know that when they want me back that I will be right there.... Why do I do this to myself.  They are killing me inside but yet I want to be with them so bad... I want to be accepted with them again.  Why was I casted aside?  I don't understand these stupid things. They make parties for the other girls and then they ask me to keep them busy so more people can show up.  I had my hopes up thinking that they might in some chance be having a suprise party for me.  No again I just got my hopes up... why do I put myself through this over and over again.  I used to be an individual... why do I need them??? I can't stop crying.  There is just so much on my mind and so little space.
Now I know how I make the others feel... why was I such a bitch I wish that I could turn my life around and start over... I would make new friends and stop hanging with the bad ones... I guess this is just a way for God to test me."

"event","I can't believe that I made it this far.  It seems like just yesterday I was starting kindergarden.  College isn't as scary as I thought it was going to be... it is actually a brand new experience that I can't wait to get more of.  I am a very busy student.  I am trying to get more involved.  I am going to a kung fu class on Monday the 8th.  I am very excited.  Most of my classes are having something to do with drama or music.  This place is so cool.  I am actually sitting in the student union center on one of the multiple laptops that they rent out for 2 hours or until the battery dies.  lol.  I am still very involved with church I go to church every Sunday, and to the ""well"" every thursday.. at least so far.  This is only my second week up here.   I feel like I have been here for years.  Everyone thinks that I am an upper classman.  That's cool.  There are plenty of nice looking guys here... there is this one guy here his name is Ryan.  He is so funny, he is cute.  He is tall, red hair, thin, always wears a baseball cap.  I told him my story of how I hate the way my laugh sounds so I try out others laughs to see which one I like better... so he did all this funny stuff trying to get me to laugh my actual laugh.  I haven't seen him around for 5 days.. well I was actually gone for most of those days.  But he usually comes to the student union center around now... but he hasn't shown.  Oh well.  He was just a crush, you know how that goes!  Well the computer I am on is about to die... I will try to write more when the computer I am on isn't dying! lol peace out"

"event","Today I got into a nice argument with my dad... I feel like he is pushing me away.  I can't believe I yelled at him over a stupid car.  How immature!  Then I sat at work and just cried... I think that it was for the sheer fact i am SO scared to go away.  I have never been away from my parents for more than a month.  I am so close to them, I don't want to go.  It's weird to think after all these years of getting into arguments, hating, shouting, and wanting to leave your house so bad.  That who would have thought of crying cause they don't want to go.  I know that I will make new friends, and hopefully keep some of the old ones.  I don't know... 3 hours away is a little to far.  Why did I chose Ashland??  Why couldn't I have just gone to UC and stayed right here with them.  But... I guess I'm very lucky.  You ask why? My parents have always been there for me.  Even though some people put me down and make me feel like I am nothing, who is there? My parents... most people say that they hate their siblings.... I could never hate mine.  He is the greatest little brother a girl could ask for.  He knows everything about me, as I do him.  I would have to say he is my best friend.  I don't know what I would do with out him.  If anything ever happened to him... I don't know what I would do.  Everyone is for me... parents, my brother, other family members and God.  Yet why do I feel so afraid?"

"event","""Setting the stage for the most sweeping restructuring of endangered species protections in three decades, the House Resources Committee yesterday approved legislation that would strengthen the hand of private property owners and make it harder for federal officials to set aside large swaths of habitat for imperiled plants and animals.""

""s there any current scandal involving the administration that cannot be traced back to that moral framework? Bill Frist's efforts to enrich himself from a stock sale of a family company? Check. Rolling back environmental standards that protect the atmosphere or other species if such standards threaten interests or power of the governing tribe? Check. The web of mutually beneficial relationships between Jack Abramoff, presidential aides, and congressmen? Check.""

not that I am against endangered species, but...lets think about this..what is happening at those facilities?

talk to me if you require more info. it is not only disturbing, but sickening.

"event","First week of school is complete and its nice to be able to see people again (not that I didn't see most of you over break). Check out my Facebook for some pics! 
Anyways, I think I am really going to enjoy my ethics in lit. class, we have had several good debates over really extreem issues and the whole class seems to be willing to participate. Fun Fun! As for my composition class, we are already starting a major essay ( all of my classes are starting right off so its nice to be able to jump right in), and psychology of course, has homework ""up the wazoo"". 
Today it is raining. Alot. Which is nice because it makes it a good day for wonderful indoor activities such as reading, writing, and sketching. 
On another note, I want to get a fish and name him steve urkle or urkel whichever way its spelt, and call him urke for short, I need a desk companion it doesn't feel the same when there isn't some animal life form next to you when you are studying.
Of course if I sat on the floor this wouldn't be a problem as mist would stretch across me like the faithful guard dog that she is. Wow im tired..

brain functionality isnt supposed to be normal during break. i am supposed to be able to be in a veggitative state, which for me means very little social interaction, and most days comprised of my nose stuck in a book surrounded by hoards of wonderful delicacies from the chocolate shop. however this has not been the case, instead of being allowed to lead a private life I have been abducted by wonderful beings called friends. who of course keep me out until 5am.
this is not all done unwillingly, or with great agitation. as a matter of fact i am often participating in the wonderful 4am disscussions about philosophy and cheescake (mmm, craving cheesecake).
SO i dedicate this journal, to ye who keepeth think ""kat i"" entertained. 
to those who entertain themselves with the single word ""onion"", and to those who can say whats better than eating 5 McDonalds pies at 2 am.
to the rest of you, luv & missing you.

Now on to that relaxing and comforting and wonderful Season of Christmas. For the past few years it really hasn't felt very celebratory to me...but this year, its def. a VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS! I am SO excited! I have this wonderful cozy feeling, like if I had hot chocolate and a good book all surrounded by a big chair with fluffy stuffed animals.
Right now I am packing to go visit my grandparents in Michigan, I plan on being back on the 26th..and then a whole month off until Spring Semester. Its starting to flurry though, so I am hoping we will have a safe and nice drive up there! Your prayers/ well wishes would be much appreciated for the journey.
So tonight I am hoping to get to go to a sneak preview of the movie Rumor Has It, staring Jennifer Aniston with a couple of friends. I have a couple more people I need to see before I leave (tomarrow morning)...I should still be posting and on AIM up until the 24th. 
Also, please if you could pray for Ruth Davis...my grandma, she is still in the hospital - she should be getting discharged today to a recovery facility but because of her osteoporosis she has had 2 fractures in the lumbar of her spine (L2 and L4 for you science majors) they put cement-like stuff in the cracks and she is doing a little better but she still only weighs 79 pounds, so things aren't so good.
Anyways, thats pretty much all thats new here. Ill keep everyone updated when I can.

Until then, Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and Blessed Kwanzaa!"

Finals, oh finals, how you make me sick
I wouldnt touch you with the end of a stick
My dreams have turned to nightmares of dread
Your multiple choice hurts my head

Ive studied and studied but Im at a despair
When all ive learned disappears in thin air
Big red and pink marks haunt my thoughts
And bring back memories of when I ""ought""

Finals, oh finals, how you make me sick
I wouldnt touch you with the end of a stick
My dreams have turned to nightmares of dread
Your multiple choice hurts my head

While the rest of the world is thinking of sugar plums
You occupy my mind with decimals and sums
Words leap off the page as seen never before
The world seems to lurch with what I must store

For every student both stupid and bright
When Christmas comes, 'tis a fright
They climb into caves of dreary statistics
Hoping to rid their brains of all the ligistics

I wouldnt touch you with the end of a stick
My dreams have turned to nightmares of dread
Your multiple choice hurts my head

One word. One doom. One spiraling down of the whole semester as well as my life. 
I am nervous. I am sick (probablly because I am nervous). I am bleary eyed so I can't see half of what I am studying - much less drive to campus safely. I am gone next week, and I haven't finished all my christmas shopping yet. I am sore because I went on a date with a guy who was more physically in shape than I was and we went for a REALLY long climb at earth treks resulting in the pulling of several of my muscles. 
I am tired. I feel like a giant blob that cannot move. I fell into the out-side christmas tree and I broke half a branch. I had to close my bank account and open a new one because somebody decided to try and illegally remove $75.00 from my account - and  being a poor college student who commutes and whose gas tank costs about $35/ gallon that is a huge ammount of money (which, thankfully the bank is replacing). 
Right now more than anything in the world I want to sleep. Eat and sleep. \
Yet, I can't.
I can't because Anatomy and Physiology is the hardest course I have taken in my entire life, and because I am supposed to be making a model for it and another paper for english.

"event","Been really sick all day. So sick that I missed my lab practical...which means that I might or might not get to take it. Which also means that I could end up failing A&P.

Yuck.

So apparently im slightly enimic (sp?). 

Date w. mike on friday was good. We saw the play S.A.N.T.A. that was written by a fellow  student, it was really funny and cute. He smelled so good, I forgot about how comforting a thing that was. He didn't hug me or kiss me, but he drove me to my car. I got a hug today from him though, he was so gentle, like he was handeling glass.

My head and throat are so sore...I can't really think.

Im still nervous about the fact that im trying to date again. I still feel like no one is going to be able to fill the role of companion for me. Ill prob. end up an old hag or as I like to think of it ""a stylishly permantely single person, that is not interested in the often stupid male species"". I guess its just my heart and heads way of telling me that I can't get hurt again.

"event","Oh, after tomarrow thanksgiving break will be here, and even though I will be working my butt off all the way through it - at least I wont have class. *Insert BIG sighs of relief* Stress has been mounting lately, and I find myself wondering why am I working and trying to go to school at the same time? Answer: Because I have to drive to school each day, and because the stupid passat takes PREMIUM, and here thats $2.29/ gallon. GRrr. At least its not $3 like it was - so im grateful. 

It's very wet outside. Good day for cookie making...but im going to be lazy and cook Ramen instead.

I think I am going to go back to the Walters Art Museum on Wednesday and try and get some more information as to do my Art History report. I want to focus on a certain kind of greek pottery (Kamares Ware) but I am not finding as much as I wanted to on the certain piece I am studying. Still its a start and I think that I will definately have it finished by next tuesday.
I have finally got some more insight as to what I want to do with my life, or rather how to go about doing it. After my masters degree I am going to do a Peace Corp graduate study program...I go to a college for a year and then I do two years of Peace Corp work after that which makes it slightly longer in getting the Bachelor's but thats okay because the experience will be just amazing and it will look great when I apply for doctorate school (still hoping to go to Yale for that). The Peace Corp really has the right idea as far as I am concerned; it fits perfectly in to what I want to do with that part of my life (meaning I can travel to another part of the world, help people - really learn what it is like to live in a foreign country while earning a degree). I am so excited!
So now to go do some more typing of a different sort and a different topic."

"event","Last night I went to the movies and I saw Zathura. It isn't as good as Jumanji, but its an okay movie - a little confusing though. Anyways that was fun, and after I drove home the stars were outside shining very brightly and the moon was like a pale white disk floating in a jewled sky, the air was fresh and cool and- well it was just beautiful.
So I curled up for a little while in my favorite chair, and read some of Amy Tan's ""The Joy Luck Club"" and I recomend it to anyone who likes a good, soulful read. My mom has recently come back from an interpretation trip in Alabama and apparently in the town she was in there was a chocolate shop that made their own chocolate candies daily, everything was so fresh she said. Anyways, she brought back a box of assorted chocolates for us to eat, and I can tell you they are wonderfully fresh and unique. One of the things (as gross as it may sound) was chocolate covered orange peels. They are sooo goood! I ate one while I was reading and it just seemed to fit in with the story. Utter happiness.
Today is one of those gorgeous fall days with a perfect blue sky and a cold wind and warm sunshine. I am supposed to go to a party this evening but I don't think that is going to happen anytime soon - I kinda need a day to myself (and the only-child syndrom rises up again) to study, walk, clean and get some things done for me. Maybe I will only go for a little while. Besides I am still feeling under the weather from my strep throat so I think it would be best to nourish myself. Cest la vie.
Eddie is wagging at me so it means I have to take them for a walk (sooo cute eddie)!

Leave one (whoever reads this).

"event","No, I am not grumpy...well, at least not throughly. No im not down in the lumps...just somewhere in between the two. Today just happened to be a mixture of bad luck, with even worse charma (if you believe in that sort of thing). I ended up not going to church because I was occupied with stabing pains to the abdominal region (hey, that anatomy class is starting to pay off), which was later accompanied with a spliting headache and a wedge like protrusion sticking out of my spine. So, I took great care to make my recovery as swift, and pleasnt, as possible. Which meant I was found, around the time of 12, bundled up in heat packets, with pain killers and tea in the drivers seat of my car. As I approached work I nearly got hit twice, and despite it all I couldnt help but think that with how much my parents had paded me into the car, I could be in a head on collision going 70 mph, and not obtain a scratch. After rolling out of the car and waddling in to work I realized that this wasn't going to be an ""easy"" Sunday. It was our busiest Sunday in two months, and happened to be the Sunday that we needed it to be as calm as possible. Two of our four sales associates could not work the one register we had, and the Vera Bradley Section- lets just say that the displays decided to leap off the walls. Oh, by the way our store is moving - literally to the other side of the wall- and we had to have all of our things out of half of the store by closing. Didn't happen. That means there is aprox. 15 boxes left to move and some misc. breakable items. for our manager to move at 7am, and have finished by 9 am. That prob. won't happen either. So we got out about half an hour later than usual. I drove home to find awaiting me (keep in mind I have an anatomy quiz tomarrow on all of the muscles in the body, and a couple of papers to write- not to mention laundry to do and my own room to clean) a mom who had a migrane, no one had been fed, and all of them begging for dinner. So, I fed the dogs, began making dinner, proceeded to burn a batch of has browns and a egg all the while waiting for the other half of ""dinner"" to arrive (dad had to go to the grocery store). When ""dinner"" arrived, only HALF of what was needed arived, no hashbrowns, the wrong milk, and bacon instead of sausage (and I quote my mom ""but I wanted bacon"")! I, at my wits end handed the spatula to my dad, told him to fix the rest of dinner and came to my room, turned on my classical music, and tried to rejuvinate my tired body and mind to a point where studying and cleaning migh again become an option.

So that is how you my dear readers (whoever you are) came to read my ventings. Now that they are through, I would like to say that this fall's colors are most exquiste and that I am throughly enjoying being on the east coast for this season, though I am still missing Arizona more than ever. I think I am going to press some leaves and attempt to do a nice scrap book, especially seeing as it is my last year at home ( I am hoping to be living in an apartment off of campus wherever I end up transfering to). I will of course be coming back summers, and breaks but there won't be a ton of visits. For those of you who are curious, these are the schools I am considering: HOOD, UMarylandCP (only maybe), MontanaSU, and any other place that has both a good history, and a good english program."

"event","hi world.

it was so nice to get an extra hour of sleep this morning. i didn't really get to experience the joys of daylight savings time the first night, but waking up this morning at 8:30 - ah, that was the life. Anatomy was intersting today, and Prof. Repka was in her usual wonderful mood. Her lecture was as always, entertaining and I understood everything pretty well but the last part was just as confusing as it could possibly be. Then it was back home with brent (I forgot my calculator - the downside to commuting to college), and after that to math class where I had my Chapter 6 test. It almost ate me alive, I was sitting there for about 15min. trying to think of an identity that I needed to know for 3 of the 8 problems on the test (the test was only 45min. long). Finally 5 min. before the test ended I remembered it, and frantically tried to finish the last 3 problems. My guess is that I wasn't too successful and that I hindered my grade more than I helped it today. Not the end of the world but I do need to start focusing more on my math than I have been. I almost fell asleep during the test too, so after that I headed over to starbucks to meet nikki and get some lunch. Who showed up but the sana! So he and I abandoned Nikki to skip her english class. I was heading down to the diner contemplating if they would take a check and my friend from Anatomy says, oh just pay me back on Wed. and hands me a 20! I was a very happy person and I had a lot of food (sandwich, fries, drink, and pickle). Then it was up to Lab to disect a cat. Oh that was so frustrating! The tissue wouldn't seperate prop. from the muscle, and to think that we have so much more to do on it. Anyways I locked up my disection and came here (the library). I have so much studying left to do its amazing! Well, now its time to head home, finish picking up my room and complete as much homework as possible before 12. 

ew. I still smell like disected cat....I think a shower is in order, and a coffee on the way home. Or I could study at my favorite coffee shop tonight. I think that might be in order. English test tomarrow should be fun, I like essays (Mental note: Sherman Alexi post-it due this week- he was such a great speaker). Ok time to go get a tutor time and then home.

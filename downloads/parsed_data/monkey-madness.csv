"event","So, it's been awhile. A long while. Logan was born September 20th...he was 9 lbs 14 oz, and is now almost 3 months old and is already 14.5 lbs! He is huge, long too so he is just a huge baby, almost too big for his infant carrier. Brianna is a little chatterbox. Never stops talking now. And is halfway potty trained which is very exciting, lol. Sean is going into the Air Force, with any luck he'll be in before Christmas, and Tony has joined the Navy and Chrissy the Air Force...so it looks like all the Weygandt kids will be shipping out next year leaving Bonnie and Kevin behind with their foster kids, lol. Its exciting though. Sean is going in as probobly an aircraft mechanic, and will have Tech shool in California, the kids and I will be able to join him after 30 days, but we will probobly sooner since the base is 2 hrs away from my families house in Newport Beach. Sean is putting on his 'Want List' while he's in boot camp to be stationed overseas (like Europe), which would be awesome if we got that. My family is all terrified, we are really excited. We will keep our house and rent it out for probobly around $600 to cover the mortgage and association fee, and then make just enough off of it to save up for new things like new carpet and windows. We hope to over the years acquire more rental property...thats how my grandparents became so wealthy. :-) Well theres my update, short, but I dont think anyone reads this anyway...and Logan is in his exersaucer getting annoyed at me for not gushing over him. Oh, last thing. Tony is getting married a week from today, I hope everything works out for him and Rachael as I know it will be really hard on them in the beginning...but hopefully they can get stationed together (shes in the Navy as well but has already shipped out and is in her A-school) and everything will work out. And there Logan goes..."

"event","It's a boy! YAY! Sean and I are *so* excited. However these last two days have been VERY rough on us. We had our ultrasound on Wed. to see how the baby is doing and my OB called Thurs to tell me how everything is going, not good. The ventricles in the babies brain are enlarged, which is defiantly not good. From what I have found on the internet and talking to various people is that it can be fixed by placing a shunt in the babies brain after he is born, and letting the fluid drain out into the babies abdomen. If it is not caught right away it can lead to brain damage, but since they caught it before the baby is even born the chances for that are slim. They also noticed that the babies kidneys are not devolping which is causing there to be too much amniotic fluid in the placenta, which is also not good. For two reasons, one too much amniotic fluid can lead to deformities, and also more obviously, it means his kidneys are not functioning properly which is a serious problem. I am having a level 2 ultrasound (a 3-D one) on the 24th and all of this will either be confirmed and we will find out how severe it is, or it will be discovered that everything is fine we just have a late bloomer. We are hoping for the ladder of the two, but are still extremly worried. I had a bunch of labs done last week by my family doctor, and found out more bad news today. One of my tests came back abnormal, one testing the functionality of my liver. Apparently the levels came back much higher than normal so I must go in on Monday to go over the results and I guess we will see what happens from there. My mom came out this weekend which is nice, it is really nice having her here to reassure me that everything will be fine, but at the same time it is VERY hard to believe that this is happening. We had no problems with Brianna, and now this one is being very difficult. I can't help but feel like something is wrong, and that all of this won't turn out to be nothing. 

On another note we still need to pick out a name for this little devil, I'm loving Noah, Nolan, Trevor and Trent, and Sean is being oh-so-difficult by REFUSING to consider any other name than Derrick and Gabriel, both of which I dislike. This kid needs a name..."

"event","At work we are printing a poetry book for the local high school, and I got the lucky task of entering all the poems that we turned in without disks. I would have to say that at least half of the 7 poems I keyed in were about Ben's suicide. Im not sure if I posted about that...I may not have. In November, this boy Ben committed suicide. He was only a freshman in high school, and out of the handfull of times I had met him I had liked him. He was a very bright, happy kid who always had a smile on his face. You could tell by the way he interacted with people that he really cared about everyone he knew, he was one of those kids that everyone from every social group loved him. Well, as I stated he committed suicide, leaving behind his parents and 12 year old sister in a complete mess that will take a lifetime to clean up. I remember going to his funeral and feeling like I shouldn't have been there. Everyone in that room knew and loved Ben, kids from his school were lined up outside for three blocks just to catch a final glimpse. I'm not saying I wasn't sad about it, it was a horrible, horrible thing to have happened, all the lives he had touched was tremendous. But I couldnt help but feeling like here I was, standing in the warmth of the funeral home during calling hours for a boy I had only met 10 or so times, when there were a countless number of kids standing outside to say good bye to their friend that most had known their whole lives. Reading their poems and stories today really made me think of how many people truly suffer when one person either takes their life, or has their life taken from them. It branches out so much further than the daughter such as myself, who was too selfish to forgive her dying father, or the widow wondering what she will ever do raising two small children by herself. A death reaches out so far, farther than anyone could every imagine and touches lives bringing them all together for one. It's just amazing. Reading these poems makes me want to go see all these kids and tell them that he is OK, even if I may not believe it myself, I just want them to believe that it wasn't their fault (as so many do), that there was nothing they could have done (like so many think they could have), and that Ben will always be with them, even if they cant see his face.

Reading the poems and writing this entry really makes me upset at how much people take for granted. I read all these entries from my friends, both here and on another blog where they are bitching about their shitty lives, lack of friends, etc. I wish people would get the hell over themselves and think of someone else, myself included. Im not trying to preach, I think I am just fed up with all of the pettiness that I am surrounded by. 

This isn't how I want Brianna to view the world."

Well we get to our exit and he passes it, I asked where we were going and he said he was taking a short cut. Well four hours later we reached our destination. To Niagra Falls! Isn't that sweet?! I was so surprised. I did end up guessing when we got into New York, but before that I was clueless. We stayed at this really nice hotel and had a lot of fun. We went to this outlet mall (did anyone really think I could go a weekend without shopping?!) and I got this adorable sweater from Club Monaco that retails for $50, I got it for $20 and of course I bought two. We also of course saw the Falls, which was surprisngly really romantic even though it's February. We are planning to go again for the 4th of July, which I think will be awesome. Watching Fireworks over Niagra Falls? Well got to go, I've got class in half an hour.."

"event","Well. This last week has been interesting. I got accepted to Akron U, very exciting. I go in tomorrow night to pick my classes. Sean had surgery last Thrusday, he had his tonsels removed and something done to his nose which I dont know the name of. The surgery went well, and he was doing fine until last night. He called me at work saying he needed to go to the hospital, that he was coughing up blood. I ran out of work, called his mom and asked her to call Seans dad who works right next door to where we live and have him pick Sean up and meet me at the hospital. We all got to the hospital, Chrissy got off work early and watched Brianna for me and we waited. He was doing well, only coughed up blood once. About an hour and a half later they said he could go, but to watch him over night and bring him in immediatly if he started bleeding again. Well, right after the nurse walked out of the room to get his discharge papers he started bleeding again, and if you have a weak stomach I suggest you stop reading now.

Now, Sean said he was coughing up blood, but this was nothing like that. He was vomiting blood, not just a little mixed in with what he had eaten it was ALL blood. His parents ran out to get a nurse and here I am holding these little kidney shaped containers infront of Sean, trying to catch as much as possible. He filled three in less than a minute, I couldn't hold all of them, so I had to drop them, spilling blood everywhere, to grab more. The nurse came running in and he stopped, after filling the 4 container. They decided to admit him, and prep him for transfer to the Medina hospital where his docter was. They put him in another room, slightly larger so they could put moniters on him. While we were waiting for the ambulance to show up he started vomiting again. This time was much worse. He filled two bed pans completely. In less than 2 minutes. It was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life. I have never seen so much blood, let alone someone puke that much at once. By this point we were terrified. Eventually the ambulance showed up and they let me ride with them. As soon as we got to Medina General they took Sean into surgery. After waiting for two hours the doctor came out and told us that Sean was fine, there were 2 ruptured veins where his tonsels were removed and they had formed clots in his throat, but he had clotterized them and we'd be able to see him soon. Another hour later we got to see him and he looked great, drugged (they gave him morphine) but really good. They took him up to his room, and finally at 11:30 I left to get some sleep. Yesterday was probobly the scariest day of my life. Luckily they discharged him this morning, and he's sleeping upstairs, I really hope this is the end of the story."

The club was pretty dead, not half as many people as either of us expected, but we still had fun. The club wouldn't let me drink, but this little pubv across the street would so we just went back and forth so I could drink. Theres this crazy law where if you are married and under 21, so long as your spouse is 21 or older the younger of the two can drink also! It rocks. LOL Brianna is chewing on the desk. Anyways Sean and I are doing well, he turns 22 on the 20th so Im trying to think of something fun for us to do.

Not 'I'm going to cry' pain, just 'If this dosen't end soon I'm going to start swinging' pain. It is on my lower back, and it is the cutest fairy. She is HUGE way bigger than I thought, but its okay, I love it. I'll take a pic. w/ Tony's webcam when he comes home, and put it as my icon. Everyone says it hurts more on the bone, I disagree. It hurt waaay more on the fatty part of me than on the bone. Anyway, I love it.

Today we entered Brianna in a baby contest, and guess what? She WON! Got 1st place for her age group (8-18 months) and can go onto state in June. I don't know if we'll do it, I just hate how all the parents act. They are way worse than the kids, its sick. There was this one little girl, she was in the 4-6 yr. age group and she won for her group and was like ""I'm going to be in a commercial, I'm going to be sooooo popular"", it was sick. Why would her parents tell her that? If she dosen't win it's setting her up for disappointment. Anyway my back is just a little tender and this isn't very comfortable, so I think I'll go...clean out my car! Even more exciting, oh well, needs to be done.

Oh, btw, Chrissy and I are going to an all male revue tomorrow night, aka MALE STRIPPERS! :-) we are so excited, I got premium seating, we'll be so close to these guys we'll be able to smell 'em. LOL."

I went shopping today with Bonnie and Chrissy, bought myself a new fall pea coat, very cute. I'm starting to look for a new job. The one I've got is a little worrysome. I'm not too comfortable with their ethics. It's a maitence co. so they work on Block busters and things like that. Lets say a toilet clogs at a blockbuster in Houston, well, we will hire out a plumber in that area to go fix it. And then they don't pay them until those people threaten to sue us. I'm not too comfortable with that. I worry it will eventually happen to me. So, I'm on the hunt. Anyhow, Brianna is a little pistol now, walking around telling me no, and doing whatever she damn well feels like. Shes fun though, can't wait for number 2. Sean and I are considering adopting a puppy. I want one so bad, especially for Splinter.  I know once we get the house he is going to be lonely. So I want to get him a friend. We are thinking of getting him around Christmas time. Speaking of which, Sean and I are planning on driving out to IL for christmas. We are planning on leaving christmas eve morning (or the night before christmas eve) and comming back the day after christmas. Sounds like fun to me. We would fly but im sure Brianna will be getting an ass load of gifts this year. Anyways, I've got to go order my tickets to go see some male strippers next sunday.

There is nothing they can do for him anymore. Does anyone know how hard this is? Honestly. To be told that there is nothing humanly possible to be done for your father? To be told point blank that this time next year you will no longer have a dad? I am so ANGRY. How can there not be anything? Of all the advances mankind has made there is not one thing that can be done to save his life? I have so many emotions I don't know what to do with them all. I want to just break down and cry, scream at my mother for still smoking when she sees what it has done to my father. I was talking to Sean about this yesterday, and I am convinced there is no God. What kind of bieng would do this? My whole entire family has been praying since the day we found out and for what? NOTHING. For him to still be taken away, for McKenize and Nick to grow up without a dad! I told my mom what's going on yesterday, and all she could say was 'That sucks, that really sucks.' and 'You barely even know him' Way to point out the obvious mom. I guess she dosent know what to say.I mean, her ex husband is on the brink of death, her children's father, what would I say? I don't know, but I doubt it would be 'that sucks'. For the past 2 days now I've had the feeling like I'm going to throw up. I wish I would. I just don't know what to do. 

I know I should see him but I can't. Going over there, looking into his unconsious face, trying my very hardest not to cry. I wish more than anything I could do what I've never done, curl up next to him with his arm around me and tell him I love him. How could I now? 

I can't go to his funeral. All those poeple, looking at me and my siblings with pity on their faces thinking 'Poor them', I can't do it. 

I feel like he's gone already. I've lost him before he even really truly passed, the medicine has taken him first."

He's been in the emergency room and admitted twice this week. Morphine isn't strong enough for him anymore. They found a blood clot in his chest, lost it, and 'maybe' found it again. His tumor count is 7, 2 on the brain, one on the kidney, one on the liver, one on the lung, on on his spine, and one on his shoulder. He is never concises, he falls asleep in the middle of a convorsation. He can't walk. He can't sit. He can't lay down in one position for more than 5 minutes. He dosen't eat. He can't walk up the stairs to take a shower. He can't stand long enough to go to the bathroom. He couldn't go to my gradutation. He dosen't even remember I graduated. He dosen't know what day it is, or what time. He can't write his name. He can't watch McKenzie's dance recital, he can't watch Nick's tae-kwon do matches. He can't see his first granddaughter crawl. He most likely won't out live his own parents.

But, guess what he can do? He can still smoke. He can still do the one thing that made him unable to do anything. So, to all of you that smoke. I hope you read this and think about it. Is it worth it? It takes your life and wraps it into a little ball leaving you with absolutely NO control. Theres commercials everywhere about what smoking does to you, about how horrible it is. But it isn't real. They don't really show you how nasty it is until it is in your face. Killing someone you love as you sit by and helplessly watch.

Smoke spirals up in ringlets
towards the darkened sky.
Surrounded by barricades, 
all I can smell is the scent of burnt flesh.
Jacob only five feet away,
close enough to embrace in my lonely arms,
but separated mercilessly by a chain link fence.
His pale blue eyes stand out
among the dirt stained skin
he looks at me through the small holes
those beautiful eyes pleading for life.
Shoes two sizes too small
sneak out of line and over to me at the fence.
I can almost smell his familiar scent
radiating above the dirt and grime.
Through the barrier he slips me a small package,
""I Love You"" he whispers
and creeps back into line unnoticed by the guards.
I watch as two men in uniforms
command his group in German,
attempting to herd them towards the large concrete building.
I loose sight of him as the last of the group shuffles in,
tears glide down my cheeks as I helplessly watch
all I have in life spiral up into the heavens.
The small package begins to melt in my sweaty palms,
unwrapping it I find a small nugget of chocolate
resting in a torn piece of cloth, a shirt, Jacob's shirt.
Cradling this final gift in my hands
I look out across the horizon and see a new group
being prodded towards the fields.
One man, the same height and stature as Jacob
lags behind the rest looking back towards the gate.
He waves, I stand in shock, could it be?
Tears no longer glide but stream down my cheeks
as I watch my life, my love standing now 20 feet
away from me, spared by this one small gift."

Theres only a certian strength of Morphine you are allowed to get from the pharmacy and he's on it, and it's not strong enough. So, he's in the hospital. His 48th birthday is Sunday, and he'll be in the hospital. I can't visit him, neither can Kenzie, or Nicholas, or Brianna. His 48th birthday and he will be alone. Of course my grandparents will see him and some of my aunts and uncles, but his own children and grandchild won't be there. We can't see him because the medication he is taking makes him radio-active and it would be harmfull for the kids to go near him (Kenz and Nick aren't allowed in the same room as him anymore) and I can't go near him because of Brianna, I would absorb it and it would do harm to her? I'm not exactly sure.

I found all this out yesterday, and ever since then I've been thinking. What if this was happening to me and Sean, and Sean wasn't able to see Brianna. What if I wasn't able to sleep in the same bed as him? Eat off the same fork as him? If I wasn't even allowed to touch him? I don't know why this is happening to my family and I don't know what to do. We are moving in a month and now I don't know if I can do it. Saying good bye to my family is one thing, I know I will see them all again soon, but my dad? Everyone says to be positive but how can I? How can I be positive when Mary screams at me because my dad and I aren't close enough? How am I to be strong when I look into McKenzies eyes after my 48 year old dad falls to the floor like a child? When he can't bend over to pick something up off the floor?!

"event","Graduation is a weeek from Friday. It dosen't seem real. A week from this Friday I will no longer be in high school, it's weird. To think that in the fall I won't be entering those halls, strolling up to my locker and spinning the combonation-it's kind of sad. I feel like I'm not ready, but I know I am. I've only spent 3 years there but it feels like an eternity. I'm sad that I won't get to do the things my friends are doing next year, like go to prom and all that, but then again I've never really done what my friends have done. 

I'm watching my neighbor, he's been outside for the past 3 hours putting new woodchips down on his kids swingset. The swingset isn't even that large that it would take 3 hours to finish, but apparently it is a difficult task, raking woodchips. He's about 3/4 of the way done, it's going to rain all over the new chips in about an hour. 

It's funny how some tasks that seem so simple to some can be so difficult to others. Some people just give up when things get tough, and others keep going without even thinking about what is to come. I guess I am that way, I do things no matter what anyone else things, not even taking into consideration it might rain all over me an hour after I've finished.

This whole entry makes sense to me, and then again it dosen't. I guess things just happen in their own time. No one can really set a moment when it will be finished, everything will just fall into place. My neighbor with his woodchips, and my graduation.

Thank you from one member of the class of 2004."

When we move out there he'll be making the same as he is out here (which is awesome because when we move out there it will be like earning $14-$15 an hour here, get it?) and we can defiantly afford a house on that. So, theres that. I just applied for me and Sean to be on this reality TV show on weddings, I hope we get picked. They pay for part of your wedding which would be AWESOME, because we are poor and I don't like asking my mom for money even though she said she'd give it to us. Anyways, Brianna sat up yesterday for the first time by herself, very cool. Sean said she ""crawled"" but I don't think she did. I almost died yesterday, had a 102* temp, it sucked, but I'm better now. So, I think thats it...15 days of class (then 1 and a half of finals) and then I AM DONE! Oh, yea, that hurts dosen't it Court?"

"event","So we are most defiantly moving to Ohio this summer, we found a condo that we are in love with in Seville (sp?) and are hopefully going to be there by June. We are flying out there April 16-19 to look at some condos and visit with Sean's family. I am excited to get away, even for four days, it is well needed. My mom pretty much decided she is moving out and ""dosent know"" if she will have room for us, so we have to move. The amount Sean was approved for isn't even enough to buy a box out here, so off to Ohio we go. I am excited, I'll get to go to Kent State instead of Columbia..woot. Anyways, I need a nap and 3rd hour is almost over.

The condo we like is 2 bedrooms, 1.5 baths, full kitchen, utilitey room, a BACKYARD (so it's really more like a townhouse), garage, and I think the complex has a pool...all this for a whopping, $75,000. Cheap stuff. The condo we are looking at here has just about all the same things minus garage but plus health club is $114,000. See the difference? 

I am so excited."

"event","NEW YORK (Feb. 12) - Just like J.Lo and Ben, the romance is over for Barbie and Ken.

After 43 years as one of the world's prettiest pairs, the perfect plastic couple is breaking up. The couple's ""business manager,"" Russell Arons, vice president of marketing at Mattel, said that Barbie and Ken ""feel it's time to spend some quality time - apart.""

""Like other celebrity couples, their Hollywood romance has come to an end,"" said Arons, who quickly added that the duo ""will remain friends.""

Arons denied that there was any truth to rumors that the breakup was linked to the Cali (as in California) Girl Barbie, arriving in stores now. To better reflect her single status, Cali Barbie will wear board shorts and a bikini top, metal hoop earrings, and have a deeper tan.

This new style already has attracted a new admirer, Blaine the Australian boogie boarder.
 
   
Barbie - the most popular fashion doll in the world, according to toy maker Mattel - met Ken on the set of a TV commercial in 1961, and they have been inseparable ever since.

Arons hinted Wednesday that the separation may be partially due to Ken's reluctance to getting married. All those bridal Barbie dolls in toy chests around the globe are really just examples of Barbie's wishful thinking, he explained.

Another possible factor is Barbie's career. The doll who was ""born"" Barbie Millicent Roberts in 1959 has been everything from a rock star to military medic, and she's currently marketed in more than 150 countries. According to Mattel, every second, three Barbie dolls are sold somewhere in the world.

So where does that leave Ken? Said Arons: ""He will head for other waves.""

Haven't updated recently, but I am now. My Aunt June (not so much of an Aunt by blood, I've known her all of my life however, everyone has one of those I'm sure), but anyways, my Aunt June is dying. I knew that, we all did, but it didn't become real until just tonight. She has lung cancer (same cancer my dad has), and it spread to her liver (just like my dads has), and also to her brian. It was/is to the point that she can no longer count. She used to knit all the time, she knitted outfits for all the new babies in the family, and I received the last thing she ever knitted, 3 adorable outfits for Brianna. Everything is so surreal. I knew she didn't have much longer, we could all see the pain in her eyes on Christmas, but she was so good at faking it. 

I got a call tonight from my mom, she told me that June is on her final days, that Al (her husband) has given us the okay to come say our final good byes, and to prepare myself for the funeral. What I've been sitting here wondering is how do I prepare myself for the funeral? And how do I bring myself to walk into her house, the house me and Brittany used to run to every afternoon in the summer to play with her birds and make cookies in? How does someone do that? I know I should, for all the years she has been like a Grandmother to me, I owe her this, one more good bye, to let her see Brianna for the last time. But I just don't think I can do it. I don't know how I could do it without upsetting her more than she already is, more than her family already is...."

VERY nice car. especially compared to my 1991 Ford Exploder. Also, we found out  my dad has lung cancer. It has already spread to his back (right by his spine where all the nerve endings are), and to his liver. That's pretty much all we know right now. Jessica is hysterical and I don't know what I am. I am upset, of course, but anything other than that I'm still trying to figure out. I think more than anything I'm disappointed. I went over there today with Brianna, and Mary (my step mom) was yelling at me because I never spent time with my dad. I know she wasn't mad at me, she is just upset because I had the opportunity to spend time with him and get to know him but I never wanted to, and McKenzie and Nick probobly wont even get the chance. But her yelling at me made me feel really terrible. I know I was a brat then, and always blew him off. But I was just doing it to get back at him for not being there. Now I of course regret it because I doubt that I'll ever know my dad, but what  Mary said to me made it seem like I didn't deserve to know him. That it wasn't fair that I had the opportunity, and not McKenzie and Nick the ones who really deserve to know him. I don't know. This whole thing is too much. And on top of that my mom is still with that asshole Steve. I am seriously considering the idea of hiring a hit man. Okay, not seriously, but I would love to do it. Or at least have someone kidnap him and send him to some desert in Iraq. In the middle of nowhere. My mom spends almost every minute that shes not at work with him. Besides the fact that she knows that not only do Jessica, Sean and I hate him with a passion, but so does the rest of our family...and she won't break up with him. But the biggest reason I'm pissed, she spends ZERO time with Brianna. The only time she does spend with her, is when I have to go somewhere that I can't take her with and there is no one else to watch her. Which sucks for Brianna because not only will she not get to know her grandpa, but from the way it looks, she wont get to know her grandma either. Brianna's screaming, thats my que...."

She was supposed to be here again on Monday, but she couldn't because she had a meeting or something. Today is my due date, but I don't think today is the day. But I do think it will be sometime before Saturday. My doctor decided that if she isn't delivered by the 18th then we are going to induce at Sherman. So no matter what, a week from tomorrow, I'm going to have a baby. Weird. I can't wait to see what she looks like. I got a job as a receptionist for the Hair Cuttery in Carpentersville and also in Lake in the Hills, I start a week to two weeks after the baby's born. And that is about it. We got the babies room all set up and ready, but then my mom decided to get carpet in my room and hers, so all of our stuff is in the babies room. So it is yet again a mess. Oh, my mom's new boyfriend Steve (whom none of us like aside from my mom and the dogs) has been cheating on her. We found out yesterday. This lady called first asking for Steve and then asking for my mom, so I gave the phone to my mom, she asked who it was and she said it was Steve's girlfriend. So it doesn't look like there's anymore Steve. Thank god.  I really didn't like him, he talked way too much, and thinks he knows everything about everything under the sun. He got into an argument with me over baby bottles. It doesn't matter he's done. Well, I need to go get ready, we are going out to dinner with my grandparents tonight. Should be fun. Oh I got my cell phone finally, its like the size of my palm, I'm afraid I'm going to loose it. But if anyone wants it, the number is 847-271-1201...yea, call me I get lonely. LOL."

"event","What a change of events. Everyone's car seems to be broken except for mine and Seans. Strange. I got my car back, this is its last chance, according to my grandparents. And then I get my aunts car. I don't particulary want that one either, but its newer so maybe I can sell it and buy a different car, and it's free so what the hell. When I talked to my grandparents earlier this morning they told me about my stocks. Apparently I have 8 thousand dollars waiting for me when ever i want it from Pixar, and almost 2 thousand from some phone company. Both are continually going up, but I can take money out of either whenever I want. So it looks like I have 10 thousand dollars that I didn't know about. Nice. That made my day, I haven't told Sean yet but I'm sure he will be very pleased. I think I know where that money is going, a nice payment on either a decent car, or money towards a house/condo. So right now everything is good. The baby is getting quite restless. I can feel it. She has just started attacking my tailbone, no one warned me about that one. It's a weird feeling, everytime she does it I sort of lunge forward, it's neat. We've got some carpet guys puttin our new carpet in the babies room and family room/dining room. Its nice, it looks like suede. I really like it, too bad it smells. I hate that new carpet smell. Tomorrow we are putting up the crib and setting up the babies room. These carpet guys I don't think are all they can be. Everytime I walk by one of them is just sitting there looking around like hes confused, and then he realizes I'm there and starts moving around, not really doing anything in particular, just moving around. I'm tired, so I think it's nap time."

There were a lot of people there, not as many as there were supposed to be, but quite a few. Courtney came, which blew my socks off because I had no clue she was invited, but it was cool to see her again. We got a lot of stuff that we needed, and a lot of stuff we didn't, lol, but thats the way it goes I suppose. My Grandparent's got us a stroller, it was really nice, but way too heavy. It was 26 lbs. or somewhere around there, so we took it back and exchanged it for one thats only 16lbs. We got a carseat with the stroller and another car seat, a swing, and a bunch of other stuff that I'm sure no one that reads this (not than anyone really does) wants to hear about.  We had a doctor's appointment today, and she said that next week we are going to pick out a day and if the baby isn't here by that day we are going to induce. Which is EXTREMELY frightening because it will probably be within the next week and a half after that visit. So basically, 3 weeks from today, we are going to have a baby. And that's pretty obvious that we are going to have a baby, but anytime within the next three weeks. It's scary. Especially since we don't know what day exactly, it could be tomorrow. I don't know this is scary stuff, I wish I was back to the 2nd month, when everything was far away and I was still tiny....Me and Sean have been talking with his mom trying to decide on a date we are going to go out there for Thanksgiving/Baby shower, and I was thinking it would be awesome to go for Halloween. Especially since Halloween is on a Friday, celebrate two holidays within 4-5 days. And I think his mom would have a blast dressing Brianna up and taking her around showing her off in her costume (which will hopefully be a little monkey :-)). Well I doubt that I'll be posting much after this week, I have to get the baby's room in order and her clothes washed and everything packed and ready for when I go into labor. But I will try to post when the baby is born so all you people I don't know can see a pic. of her. Bye :-) 

Oh, and as a side note, me and Sean just celebrated our one year anny. last Thursday. I defiantly didn't think a year ago today we would be where we are now, but who really knows where they will be in a year?"

So this baby is not waiting until Sept 19...looks like its going to be about 2 weeks sooner-not good. We haven't had a baby shower, so we have nothing. We have a crib that we cannot set up because my mom wants to wait until the new carpet is in, and even if we could set it up, we dont have a mattress for it. We have one car seat (thank god for matt and carson) and some clothes. Thats about it. We are so not ready for 36 weeks. My shower isnt for 2 more weeks, and the carpet isnt being put in for 2 1/2 weeks, so it looks like its going to be a mad dash to get the babies room done. In other news, my mom is seeing Steve on a steady basis. Which is okay I guess, but I don't really like him that much. He's really nice, but he's just too much. He never stops talking, and some of the things he says makes you wonder what he's on. But my mom likes him, I just hope he dosen't move in, I couldn't handle that.

It will be lots of fun....My dog just busted into the wrapping paper bin and took out an empty roll of paper and is chewing on it, smart dog....Hmm...I got my car back. It works. So all is good. Sean's going golfing tomorrow with my Grandpa and a bunch of my family before the rehearsal dinner, so he gets some special bonding time with the Scherer guys. LOL. Should be amusing. Right now he has abandoned me to go drinking at John's house with 'the guys'. I was unaware that Sean had 'guys', but apparently he does. Who knew? He offered for me to go with, but for some reason I see nothing appealing about sitting around watching them get drunk and play video games. Not my idea of a good time. I'd rather sit here and do this. LOL. Anyway I'm off to serve my dogs dinner....."

"event","I'm bored. Finally have a car, gas, and some money, and no where to go. This girl Jenny Sean works with I guess invited him to go to Great America with her sometime in August because her other job is having a company picnic there. And I guess I'm the only one that thinks its weird. I just don't really get why she would invite Sean to go with her when she has a boyfriend, and it's not like her and Sean are great friends, they've only known each other for a month or 2. But I don't know, he told me about it and I tried to explain to him why I would be uncomfortable with it. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think you would usually bring someone that you work with on occasion and you don't know that well to something like that. I mean, you'd usually bring your boyfriend or close friend, not really an acquantiance. Maybe it's just me, any maybe I'm the only one that see's something weird with this, but oh well. I personally wouldn't invite Rob or Dylan to a company picnic type thing, especially since I have a boyfriend. But whatever, I'm not going to tell him he can't go, I will just explain best I can why I think it's weird, and let him make his decision. Final words about this: I don't get why someone with a boyfriend would invite another guy she dosen't really know, to a company picnic with her, especially when that guy is engaged and is expecting a kid. My veiw: Weird.

Anyways. My back is killing me. This new bed isn't doing anything special to my back, other then seemingly hurting it more. I've had this knot in my back ever since...March? Yea, same spot, won't go away for anything. I want a massage. I love Sean, but he sucks at giving massages. I want a nice, long, deep tissue massage. Mmmmmm. And I want it now. :-(  Well I think I need a shower. Maybe a little trip to McDonalds, a McFlurry sounds yummy."

"event","I got my car. An extremely sexy tan Ford Explorer. Oh yea. The handling is shit, and the radio only works when it wants to, the passenger seat is falling apart, and the turn signal refuses to stay on, oh - and the door doesn't close right so you have to slam it shut. But, it is a car, a free one at that, so I am happy. I took it for a spin today, and had a blast playing with the steering wheel. It's loose so you can spin it and the car will still go straight, I think it needs to be fixed, I don't like it. But it has a sun roof, something Sean was jealous over. my grandpa was really excited to show me that 1. the windshield wipers are new, 2. the back has a screen you can pull over so you can put stuff in the trunk and pull the screen over it and its 'hiding,' and 3. He filled the tank up. LOL. Sounds lame, but he was REALLY excited to show me all those things...When I got home my aunt called me and she was freaking out because she forgot to get Maggie a baby-sitter for Kassie's bachelorette party this weekend, and wants me and Sean to go over and stay the weekend there and watch Maggie and the dog. That would be a lot of fun, if Maggie wasn't the biggest brat in the world and we didn't have a party to go to this weekend. I feel kind of bad because its Wednesday and Kirsten just now remembered, but it is her problem. Her kid is a brat there for no one likes to watch her. Although she will pay us, and I suspect the pay will be good because when I watched Maggie for 3 hours she paid me 60 bucks, but I don't know, a weekend is a long time, especially with a 6 year old that thinks she's the queen of the world. And everytime you tell her what to do she screams, throws a tantrum and threatens to call the CIA on you. That may sound amusing to some people, but it isn't. It is hell. I'll talk to Sean when he gets home about it, but I already know his response. Something along the lines of hell no. I want a pickle. Bye. :-)"

I am the district manager of TGI Fridays' assistant. LOL. I went in last night to talk to him and give him my application, he took it from me and told me to sit down, and then taught me how to do invoices and stuff like that and walked away. So I did some invoices and he came back checked over them to make sure I understood and told me to come back Thursday when he had more free time so he could teach me how to answer the phone and do other stuff. I thought it was kind of odd seeing as how he didn't interview me, let alone look at my application to see if I was qualified, he just put me to work. But oh well, I got a new job, and I get my car today or tomorrow. Finally. It's been in the shop since Fathers Day, and the guy that's 'fixing' it doesn't even know what he's supposed to be fixing, but it's taken him over a month to figure it out. Oh well. Let's see...oh yea, my Mom has a new boyfriend. He's different. A really nice guy but kind of odd. But that's okay, he really likes my Mom and is good to her. And he meets my standards for her. Which are...at least 5'11,"" has a good head of hair, no psycho children, no psycho ex-wives, is well off financially, isn't an alcoholic, and likes to dance. And of course will be good to her. And this guy meets all of my standards so they have my blessings, LOL. They are going out Thursday and he's coming to pick her up so my Mom has been going nuts cleaning the house, she's nuts. She thinks the house smells 'like ass'. I still can't believe my Mom said that because she gives me shit when I say that, but anyway, of course our house has an odor, we have 3 dogs and 2 cats and Sean. LOL. Sean doesn't smell, well, not so much that he stinks up the house. lol. I'm hungry and my cinnamon rolls are done....ill be back."

"event","I got my license yay me. It was easy, and I almost hit a pick up truck, but I still passed. The guy was making fun of me, so my picture looks kind of dumb, but whose doesn't? I get my car this week too. It doesn't have a CD player as of yet so I'm conning my mom into buying me one. Her and Sean are going to go halves on it. (I don't know why Sean wants to buy me a CD player but he does so I'm not complaining). 4th of July was interesting. We were invited to a party at Mason's and to one somewhere in Algonquin, but we went to the Palatine fest with my mom. Sean got drunk with my mom, my aunt Kirsten and a bunch of their friends. I was designated driver. Go me. Next year Sean's staying sober and I'm getting drunk. It's only fair. But this time when he was drunk, he wasn't a sloppy drunk, he was a talkative drunk, and said something's that he's wishing he hadn't. But all is well now and the baby keeps head butting me. It freaks me out. She started last night and the first time she did it I screamed, it's the weirdest feeling possible. I applied for a job at the hospital last week, so hopefully I'll have an interview sometime this week. Let's keep our fingers crossed because I need a job...we are going to see the T3 tonight with my mom and her un-boyfriend. I'm excited. Double dating with my mom LOL. She asked us to go this morning, I don't know why, but I said yes. So I guess I should take a shower. Damn."

Sean's here again, finally. He's been here for just about...over a month? Maybe more. I don't know. The frame for my bed has arrived, but alas, still no mattress. So we are forced to sleep on a futon mattress on the floor. It's not comfortable at all. I cant wait until our mattress gets here, it will be heaven. I quit my job. It sucked, they really rip you off on your pay. And I still don't have my liscense. lol. But I should be getting it very soon and then I will get a new job. Well, after my car gets out of the shop. I'm gettin an Explorer, and my grandparent's are putting new tires on it for me. hmm....im moving along. Let's see here. I'm about 6 1/2 months now, and the baby NEVER stops moving. There she goes. She gets really excited when she hear's Sean's voice, so I have a feeling she's going to be a major daddy's girl. We went out to Ohio about 2 weeks ago for Chrissy's graduation. It was fun to see his family, his Mom and grandma were really excited to see how big I had gotten. (I wasn't lol) Well that's about it, Sean's upstairs playing Halo and I'm bored off my ass. Everyone's on vacation so there's nothing to do. :-(     Maybe I'll go start my Oceanography correspondence, lol. right. that has to be the BORING-ist (that is now a word) subject ever. I hate it. I have 1 chapter down, and I fell asleep 2 times in the middle of it. Its terrible."

I'm kidding, thats mean to say, but this kid is a major brat, but I got paid 60 bucks so its alright. I really don't know how to amuse a 5 year old. My house sucks for little kids. I need to make it kid-fun. Seeing as how there will be a child here within the next 4 months...Me and my mom went shopping today. We did some MAJOR damage. We spent 500 bucks on a new mattress for me, and then 200 for my canopy bed...400 on lights and a mirror for the bathroom, and that was that at UCC. Then we went to Menards and my mom went nuts and spent 100 bucks there, and then another 100 at Petco (I still can't figure that out....), and then we went to Barnes and Noble and I got 2 books and ordered 2 on Janis Joplin. :-). Shopping was fun.  Then we went to this resturant that Heather works at and I maxed on the best ribs ever. They were awesome. Im going there everyday. mmmm. Now my mom is outside with the, I think it's a weed wacker, cutting all the grass around the house that she couldnt get with the mower. Oh that was hilirious tryin to get that lawn mower started today. It was my mom, Jessie and I outside for a good 20 minutes trying to get it started, only to realize it was out of gas. LOL. It was the first time any of us had even attempted to use it, let alone start it since we got it. And I don't think any of us has ever mowed a lawn previous to today. Well, I still havent, my mom wouldn't let me go near the mower once it was on. Oh well. Hmm, oh, well Dana decided not to drive me to school anymore cuz she sucks, so Courtney offered. I was touched, lol. I feel kinda bad though because I haven't talked to her in awhile and now she's giving me a ride. I told my mom and Jessie and they both got really excited lol. Who knows, maybe we will be friends again. I think that'd be good, I missed her. But we will see. I told Sean about it and he was happy because he hated Dana, and I had told him about Courtney and he said she sounded cool and a ""good person"" for me to hang out with. Well I'm glad I have his approval? LoL. Right. Anyways I think I'm going to call Brit and see if she wants to catch a movie, if not I'm guna read one of my new books and give Sean a call."

Oh well, I stayed home and cleaned the house. Mom will be happy. I let Shreddar out and 20 minutes later I went to let him in, but he didn't want to come in, so I closed the door, then he decided he did want to come in, and ran right into the door. He's mad at me now. Seans been acting weird lately, or maybe its just me. I am hungry. We have no food. I could really go for some of my step moms bean dip. And some ribs. I want ribs more than I want air. Someone bring me ribs? Please? Thanks. I'll be home all night...I got a job finally. *yay* perfect job for a pregnant lady - telemarketer. lol. I'm going to call and harrass people, and get paid for it. I really don't want to work there, but I need a job, so I'll just stay there until I find a new one. lol. Sean is going to be here...eventually. Neither of us know when, his last final is the 7th, so sometime after then I guess?  Eh, I'm tired of worring about that...I'm babysitting Maggie tomorrow for my aunt, I think Brittany is going to come over to 'help' me. Then Saturday I have to go to UCC with my mom to look at cribs and find my bed. Since someone named Jim stole my bed. Bastard. I'm not enjoying the whole sleeping on the floor thing, neither does the baby since she just started kicking. I told Sean the baby is a girl, he was disappointed. He said he wasn't, but I know him better, he was. Better luck next time. The doctor told me yesterday that I'm not drinking enough. Apparently I should be drinking at least 2 gallons of liquids a day. Yea fucking right. How does one person drink that much in one day? I personally feel I drink plenty, but seeing as how I have to pee every 5 minutes, you can't tell. Thats my excuse. 2 gallons, shea. Right. I'm going to make some food and take a nap.

"event","sean and matt left today, we had an interesting weekend. they got here friday night and after we unpacked the car we decided to head over to the carnival. We were there for about 15 minutes and decided to leave. after we got home me and sean cooked steaks while jessie and matt went to get beer- they got drunk, i attempted to finish cooking, it was different lol.
Saturday we got up early and got ready to go to the city, after sean and matt fixed the car we met up with brit and we all went to chicago. we farted around at the zoo for awhile, walked A LOT and then brittany decided to go home. after she left that seemed to brighten everyones mood (she was being, well, being herself, lol) and we went to eat. we ate at ed debevics and there were SO many people there. we watied about 20 min. and finally got a table, and i got a butterfly painted on my face :-) . after that we walked around and farted around in some stores and then went on a 20 min. search for a train station. we found one and got on our train with a homeless woman. i dont know about anyone else, but i feel bad for the homeless. i think it would be terrible to be homeless, but this woman on the train, changed my opinion. she was sitting there ripping up money, and would have random outbursts yelling at us to stop talking about her and getting assitance. i dont know where she got that from because when she started yelling we were talking about white castle, but okay. lol. we got home at about 11 and then matt and sean finished off one of the cases and more happened, but more i will not share for it is private.
this morning we woke up again at 8, and me and sean just layed in bed until 9- it was so nice. i miss him. im going to miss waking up with him. :-( we then decided sean should say hi to my mom (he hadnt seen her once since he got there) and they talked for a bit and then she went off to eat with my grandparents and me and sean took a shower and woke up matt. we went to target and bought a kite, sean put the kite together, we went outside to fly it, and we found out the kite was shit. it wouldnt stay up. by then it was noon so sean and matt went to target to retrun the shit kite and went home. at 3 jim came with the boys, he finally told them him and my mom broke up, and they finished packing up his stuff. one of the things they took was MY BED! my bed. fuckers. given it was jims previous to us living here, but still, at this current time it was mine. so now im stuck with the twin mattress on the floor. it looks funny, queen size bed sheets on a twin but i dont care. 
in other news...the baby started kicking today! i felt it about 20 min. after sean left. it was sad, if only he had left a little later he would've felt it. but i think the baby knows hes gone. lol. probobly not but thats what im goin by. it feels weird. i first thought my stomach was farting, but after 10 minutes i realized that was not possible and i had a mini-soccer player in my abdomen kicking the crap out of my intestines. he/she seems to calm down when i have music on, so im just going to listen to music all the time for the next 4 months. lol. i go to the doctor tomorrow (hopefully she wont cancel on me again) to find out if its a boy or girl. i cant wait. Jessies friend Tom came over today, i call him Chipmunk cuz i used to think he looks like a chipmunk. I've known him since i was like 10 and havent seen him since i was like 14 so i was excited. hes got a little boy, and seems to think he knows everything about pregnancy, and told me that im having a girl. i guess im carrying low. damnit, maybe if i was carrying high i'd be able to fit into more of my pants lol...hmm, oh yea. sean will be back in 13 days! not even 2 weeks im so happy. after these 13 days hes mine forever. im excited. i cant wait...wee, lol. well i have to go get my works down on a disk for that contest and i gotta get a news article for my presentation thursday. weeeee"

"event","*Friends are like wedgies. They're intimately close. They know you're inner self. And it feels great when you pick out a good one!

*A friend is someone who will bail you out of jail. A best friend is the one sitting beside you saying, 'Damn that was fun.

*The best friend you can have is one you can sit on the porch with and not say a word, then get up and feel like that was the best conversation you've ever had

*If I could give you one thing I would wish for you, the ability to see yourself as others see you, then you would realize what a truly special person you are!

*I'll always be beside you until the very end, wiping all your tears away, being your best friend. I'll smile when you smile and feel all the pain you do, and if you cry a single tear, I promise I'll cry too.

*A friend is someone who can see the truth and the pain in you even when you are fooling everyone else.

*A friend is one who knows who you are, understands where you have been, accepts what you have become, and still gently allows you to grow.

*A true friend walks in when the whole world walks out

*A friend is someone who will always be there when everyone else fails

*My best friend is the one who brings out the best in me

*Finding a true friend is like panning for gold. You have to sift through the fakes to find the real ones

*Don't walk in front of me, I may not follow. Don't walk behind me, I may not lead. Just walk beside me and be my friend

I was bored and just thinkin bout how sometimes you think that someone is a true friend then stuff happens and they leave you...a true friend love u no matter what and will NEVER leave your side!! Thanx to all my true friends!! I LOVE YAWL<33"

Okay heres what I havent filled ya in on since I havent been home really in like 2 dayz!
 Saturday I had the baby shower thang and then me and Jess went to homeplace and stayed till like 7 cuz Bradly drove us round on his golf cart. Bradly is this guy me and Jess met like 2yrs ago and hes 21 and his daddy or someone owns homeplace, and every summer for the past 2 yrs when we go there we hang out with him and stuff... hes a really sweet guy and fun to be round. He goes to ECU and only has one more yr left. but its cool tho hopefully when he gets out he'll still live round there and hang out with us!! haha Well after our lil ride round the camp area me and Jess went up to Pilot Mt park and camped out with her momma and daddy. Me and Jess slept in her car and I was so scared that someone was gonna get us! and she kept rollin down her out windows and stuff and scarin me..it was soo funnie!!! then finally I fell asleep. 
 Sunday we woke up real early and ate and then went walkin round at the top of the mt. and then I went home and cleaned up and Jess came over. We hung out here while I sewed my bathin suit back together... Then we went to get Brittany Hutchens. We all went to homeplace and layed out there, I got really burnt on the bac of my legs!! hahah  We were suppose to go to this Matt guys house after we left to hang out with Bradly and Matt and Robert but Jess didnt really wanna so we didnt. Then me Jess Brittany went to get a movie to watch at my house and Decker called and wanted to come over and he did and we just all hung out which was pretty cool cuz me Jess and Decker never hang out anymore =/ I love Decker to death!! hes like my brother!! haha =) After the movie was over me and Jess took Brittany home..she lives in BFE and it was scary out there cuz we just watched a scary movie!! AHH lol Then me and Jess came bac here and watched some TV and fell asleep.

"event","Hey, whats new!? nothin really here. Im just so confused! Ya wanna kno why?! Okay even if ya dont Imma tell ya anyways!! =) haha... I kinda like this guy...most everyone knows who I like and if u dont oh well!!... anyways, he's really confusin me cuz I'll call him or whatever and hes usually workin so he dont answer...well u would think that if someone who dont wanna talk to wouldnt call u bac rite?! well this guy calls me bac whenever I call and he dont answer?! and then he tells his friend that Im gettin on his nerves so I need to lay off or somethin like that! Okay what the HELL he calls me bac if he didnt wanna talk to me or have anything to do with me why does he call bac?!?! I dont get it...and when we talk on the phone Im like if u dont wanna talk to me its cool I wont call anymore and stuff and hes like no no no I like talkin to u??!! It really makes me mad that hes doin this! He needs to make up his mind about things...if he dont like me why cant he tell me!? I mean it aint gonna bother me that much cuz its not like Im in love with him...its just a crush no big deal...so why cant he tell me?! Ive come to the fact that guys are PUSSYS and cant say nothin to ur face unless they are pickin and dont mean it! They can never look a girl in her eyes and tell them that they dont like them, they dont care, and everything else..guys like the fact that we chase them they want that...but they dont kno how bad it hurts when we think we got a chance and then after awhile we relize that we dont! Why cant guys just tell us from the beginng what they want wheather its sex, friendship, or maybe even a relationship!? Why do they play their lil games?! I think guys should grow up and tell how they feel and not keep it to themselves or tell their friends and tell us straight up!!! What do u think!? Imma go take a bath! Peace!"

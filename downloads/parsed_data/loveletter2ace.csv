"event","it's funny how unloving some Christians are.
I am very upset...but Rhonda put it so beautifully I will post her thoughts.

Judging Others, Jealousy, Covetousness, Theft, Worry, Laziness, Anger, Gluttony, Drunkeness, Sexual Imorality, Lying/Deceit, Gossip, Hatred, Bitterness, Lack of Compassion, Revenge, Cruelty, Foolish Speech, Unkindness, Slander... 
 
C'mon everyone! Choose your pet sin or add one not on the list and let those sinners have it!  
 
""ALL have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God."" 
 
NOT ONE can enter God's presence except though Jesus Christ. His blood PAID THE PRICE for ALL sin, for ALL time. No sin is exempt. Not the taking of innocent life, not homosexuality... all sin, COVERED. No one who knows Christ as Savior is bound for hell! 
 
Sometimes we like to look at the sins we are not guilty of and point to those to make ourselves feel better. Sin is sin, and the ONLY way to be righteous in God's eyes is to accept His GIFT of grace that is Christ Jesus! 
 
No amount of good deeds or rule keeping is gonna get it! ""For it is by GRACE you have been saved, through faith-and this NOT FROM YOURSELVES, it is the GIFT OF GOD-NOT by works, so that none can boast."" (Eph. 2:eight) 
  
""Because of His great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions-IT IS BY GRACE YOU HAVE BEEN SAVED."" (Eph. 2:4) 
 
""Therefore, since we have been justified (saved) through faith, WE HAVE PEACE WITH GOD through our Lord Jesus Christ, through who we have gained access BY FAITH into this grace in which we now stand."" (Romans 5:1-2) 
 
Seriously, we all have a pretty clear idea of what sin is...  
Rather than post about the abominations of our pet sins and how those commiting said sins are going to hell, how about we talk about the REAL issue? The GOOD NEWS of our salvation through Jesus Christ! 
 
If homosexuals and mothers who aborted childen are going to hell,what does that say about my angry thoughts or overeating? Sometimes I mess up, I'm not always good at keeping the rules. If we gain salvation by our own ""goodness"" we are ALL in deep trouble. We don't want to ask God to give ""those sinners"" what they deserve. WE might get it! 
 
I want to clarify that I'm abosolutely NOT saying your sin is covered... so you can just go on sinning! Our obedience to God's commands is our loving, grateful RESPONSE to what we have received. We should always be doing our best to please our loving Father. But there will be times we fail Him... and that's where grace ABOUNDS. 
 
In Gal. 2:19-21, Paul said ""... I died to the law so I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live BY FAITH in THE SON of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me. I DO NOT set aside the GRACE OF GOD, for IF righteousness could be gained by the law, CHRIST DIED FOR NOTHING!"" 
 
Did ya catch that last part? I don't believe for a moment that God sent His beloved Son to a horrifying death unnecessarily. Christ died for ME. Because sometimes I'm stubborn, or lazy, or just plain stupid. And I KNOW that His blood is enough. I for one, am overwhelmed by a Father who loves His children so much that he gave everything to keep us with Him! 
 
If you want concern yourselves with ""rules"" try these... "" Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength... and love your neighbor as yourself"" Jesus himself said there is no greater commandment than these. 
 
I don't say these things to scold any who have posted. I am very concerned about some things that have been said. I want everyone here to have full understanding of God's grace. Scripture is clear on this ""There is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus."" That promise is for EVERY believer whether they be a gossip, or greedy, or lazy, or g a y..."

...I'm running this race to win cause nothing is for keeps. To promise and not give in, with anything to chose and everything to lose, I choose you. More than I ever could have imagined. More than I ever, ever imagined....(Chase You Down)

...It's time to let go of you, even though I don't want to. It's your turn to make a move, but I cannot bring myself to the point of no return or the place of where we were. Cause tomorrow's much too far away to say goodbye. It's do or die. Yesterday has seen your face, the tears I've cried from one last try. There's nothing more....(So Long to You)

....If you're listening or not, it's time that you hear me. I don't care if you've heard it all before, I'm saying it again. Should have said this long ago, a million miles from here. I've waited for so long for you to come around, I'm calling you out. Feel you slip away, slip away. Feel you slip away, away from me.....(Calling You Out)


These are a few lyrics from the new Slingshot EP. I know...you're thinking here she goes about Slingshot again...but you know what...I don't care. You keep talking...and all I hear is blah blah blah...and I'm sure what you think about my posts. haha. oh well.

I have let a few people listen to the demo. They can't believe how good the demo is turning out. The best is Calling You Out. It's deck. 

Rhonda and I were making fun of Ben. Listening to the very first CD and the new EP. His voice was so whiney and what not...don't tell me otherwise. Let's talk about the nasaly, fake screaming, i'm so emo i just talk bands. I'm just very pissed off today. www.xanga.com/revolution_ace I shouldn't be mad at the world, but I am.

The whole Slingshot uproar is basically because I was walking in town Saturday and a kid came up to me out of nowhere and said, ""Slingshot 57 sucks."" Ok...I would respect that, but I know his brother probably was the one who convinced him, and I know for a fact that he has not even heard the new songs. All I could say was, ""get your own opinion."" I'm not the one to buy into others.


Nick and I pushed Ben over. Then Daniel kicked Ben in the butt. See, I like Slingshot so much I beat on Ben Woods.

Oh well.

i have more important things to worry about."

Too many too many problems
Don't know where she belongs 
Where she belongs

She wants to go home 
But nobody's home...

So...as everyone knows my house burnt to the ground 7 years ago. Sunday I got a call that my house was smoking. Ryan was home all alone. My prayer all the way out to the house...was, ""Please God, not again."" I wasn't emotionally strong enough to go through all of it again. I know it's just stuff that can be replaced...but I had accepted the fact and moved on a long time ago...and began to live my life in the new home....

God blessed us yesterday. Our house was on fire. If Ryan wasn't home...we would be homeless again. The water heater caught on fire...and melted away and fell through into our crawl space. The crawl space was in flames...and when the fire fighters got there...flames were shooting out of the wall...it was getting ready to take the house...but they got there right in time. Ryan was our hero that day. The last time our house burned...we lost our family cat. And we are weird people...our pet's are family. Ryan was in the house on his hands and knees looking for our cat. I am scared that he would do that...but so thankful because the smoke would have killed Milo for sure. The house has smoke damage in every room. Everyone's clothes have to be washed. We have to get new carpet. New windows. Everything must be cleaned!  Please continue to pray everything...but really remember Ryan. He is so shaken up. He was alone. His 17th birthday is Tomorrow...and we probably won't be home for it. 

Our dream is to be home by the weekend...probably won't happen. Right now we are staying at my Aunt Dawn and Uncle Colby's house. It's nice. They treat us too good. I am such a country girl. I'm not used to all the cars and noise of town. Sunday night...at about 11:00..I couldn't sleep. I kept crying...I just wanted to be home in my bed with Milo. Mom called my grandma who was taking care of Milo. I got to go over to her house and sleep with Milo. I almost felt at home. Today is going to be eventful. Fire Inspectors, Insurance Guys, and all that jazz.


Thanks to Candace, Laci, Kandi, Mac,Mike,Roger,Kim,Brody,Courtney,Pastor,Barb,Brad,Johnny,Matt,and Levi, Grams, and Gramps for all coming out. Thanks to Colby, Dawn, Landon, Austin, and Grams for housing me. Rhonda for letting everyone know and the nice chat last night. The rest of the Bruce clan for thinking of us. Libbe and Kari for doing so much...even though you are way down in Florida. Thanks to everyone who has been praying for us.

THANK YOU God! I know what could have happend...we were so blessed.

Love,

Last night I went to bed with full trust in God...my eyes were getting heavy and I prayed about the election. Before band practice, we prayed about the election...whoever shall win we would pray for and pray for our country. This still did not ease my worried mind. I really did fear John Kerry. He stood for almost everything I am against. Mom came home last night upset. Someone at her work told her that 18 year olds were not old enough to understand the importance of the election, and you should be atleast 21 to get the right to vote. This upset my mom, she snapped back. She told this woman she has an eighteen year old daughter, who watched EVERY debate, and did her research. I am proud to say that I did take this election very seriously. With my full trust in God, President Bush, and our country...I think everything will be ok. I actually respect Mr. Kerry(something I thought I would never say). He is taking his defeat very graciously. He could have carried this on for weeks...but he didn't.

God has plans in store for us...I think everyone must accept this and move on.

I am proud to say I was part of this election.

I over paid for a Yellowcard hoodie. I am dissapointed in myself...but it's pretty cool.

Slingshot concert tonight at Camp Maranatha. I can't say I'm too excited...and the main reason I am going is because it will be the last concert locally for 2 months...they have been busy recording and they hit Florida soon.

Well...my face has been rocked off by The Matches, The Starting Line, and Yellowcard...I need red bull."

"event","So...last night I drove to Savoy to see Slingshot.

There is this ordeal going on between my friends L.J. and Sierra with Ben Woods. They all go to the same church. Well...L.J. and Sierra ""muffined"" Ben's car. ""Muffined"" means...you take muffins and smash them onto the car and smear. Well..he continued to make fun of them. SOOOOOO...last night during the concert, L.J. Sierra, Candace, Kris and I....""Muffined"" the Slingshot van. It was crazy. We said our goodbyes after the show like nothing had taken place. Then we waited in the parking lot to see them come out... I think Ben's exact words were. ""You have got to be freaking kidding me."" Their faces were classic. Everyone had their laughs but they will get us back.

I have pics of Dear Ben driving the van. Too Funny!

That was about it on me."

So...yea...there are so many concerts this month. I am hoping to make all of them...but I can't make plans too far ahead with the drama going on in my life.

Right now G-pa is doing amazing in the Nursing Home...PRAISE GOD! He is even getting his strength back...so keep him in your prayers.

I am so excited to see The Dog and Everything and Orwell...well hopefully Orwell...Mom said Josh is sick....so I will be praying.

So...mom and I watched my Slingshot tape...Nick McNeely covers the first half of The Darkness ""I Believe in a Thing Called Love""....nothing compared to the real deal...but it's pretty good actually....and then I started thinking of all the younger Slingshot fans....when he sang it the first time I was the only one who knew what the song was or who The Darkness were....those girls are so deprived....it's a sad sad Slingshot world...but still I <3 them...

Do I really want to go on as labeled ""The Slingshot"" girl...I mean yea...they are one of my favorite bands and all...but I think the label is meaning more obsessed....which recently I am not....yes...I do admit...I had very serious feelings about one of the members...and never told anyone...because it is not the right time...and I have met someone who really nice...and I want to pursue...I like spending time with the band and Crystal...and I actually do like the new music better than anything the old band did...but I have lost so many old friendships over them...missing things to go to a concert....I don't know...oh well...

"event","I once picked a rock like this up out of deep brown field.  My grandfather's hair was deeply brown, the color of the dirt.  One shock hung down between his eyes.  His baggy, dirt streaked jeans were held up by suspenders over his plain, white, T-shirt.  He and I hauled rocks from feathery field to truck.  We picked rocks, not as one picks flowers, but as one picks quills from dog snout.  We made the field seed ready with our hands, sweat falling to weight and muddy one or two small circles of dirt."

"event","February has seemed like a really busy month this year.  Of course, Josh would say, ""You say that about every month!"" So, maybe I'm in denial about how busy we are.  

Last Saturday I had to take the first of many tests to become an officially certified Oregon teacher.  I will still have to take 4 Praxis exams (they are each $100.00), the ORELLA exam (also a cool hundred), and the Oregon State Civil Rights class/exam (60 dollars).  At any rate, I was up early to drive to Portland to arrive at the testing center, a Catholic highschool, by 7:30.  

When I got to the testing center I had to wait around until 8:00 while the test proctors barked to us several times that if we got caught with a cell phone we might face extraordinary rendition.  I took my phone back to my car, and, since I had a half hour to kill, got some papers I needed to read out of the car so I could read them while I waited.  As it neared 8, the proctors barked more loudly and often about the cell phones, so I decided I'd better not waltz into the testing room with my papers, either.  I also didn't want to go back to my car at this late time.  Therefore, I decided to stow the papers in the pocket of my windbreaker and hope no one saw them later while I was taking the test.  

I tried this basic tactic once before in my life, 11th grade to be exact.  Mrs. Stone, the English teacher, had a strict no gum rule.  If you know me, you know I love gum.  I chew it all the time.  This habit, apparently, goes back to my high school days.  One day in English, Mrs. Stone told us all to, ""Come up to the front and spit out our gum.""  I was painfully shy in high school, and so I was too embarassed to go up to the front of the room to spit out my gum.  I decided instead to just keep it in my mouth but not chew it.  That lasted for about five seconds.  Mrs. Stone caught me chewing, and made me come up and spit my gum out.  I was doubly embarassed and I got my only detention of my life.  When my mom came to school to pick me up or something (I can't remember why she was at school taht day), she came into detention and asked me what I had done.  When I told her, she completely understood.  My mom was really understanding about my shyness.  There are definitely times during my childhood when she ""got"" me.  Of course, this memory flashed through my head as I stuffed my ""contraband"" papers into the pocket of my coat, put my coat over my arm, and got in line to go to my room to take my test.  

After getting into the room, we had to wait until 8:30 until we made sure everyone who wanted to be there was there.  Time ticked slowly, slowly, as we all waited, in silence with strangers, for 8:30 to come round on the clock's dial.  I tried to meditate.  I didn't want to look too weird, though, so I tried to meditate with my eyes open, but this required staring at the same place.  Eventually I thought it must look really strange to be staring at the same spot for an extended period of time, so I decided to quit meditating and I looked up at the clock.  8:03.  Then, I resorted to rearranging my five sharpened #2 pencils and checking for the best erasers. I looked up at the clock again:  8:04.  Then I looked at the posters kids had developed and hung up on the walls.  I thereby learned a lot about papal indulgences, as the test was at a Catholic school. The clock now read 8:07.  This was going to be a long wait.  I thought about my papers in my coat...papers that needed to be read, papers that would help time pass by....papers that I could doodle upon....But, nope, my good teacher judgement got the better of me and I left them hidden in my coat pocket.    

At 8:30 the proctor began reading the test instructions.  Essentially, he said, ""Take your time.  Answer all the questions, you won't be punished for guesses, fill in the bubbles completely.  In your essay, you have to write to the topic and you only get one piece of paper.""  Somehow, this information took 20 minutes to convey properly.  

When I finally started the test and 8:50, I was ready to go.  I went as quickly as possible and willed my papers to not fall out of my coat pocket, especially when the proctor made his rounds by my desk.  I was the second one done.  What remained was to pick up my coat, turn in my test, and make it out the door without the papers being discovered.  I gingerly picked up my coat and sucked in my breath.  The papers stayed inside.  I walked to the front trying to look cool, calm, and collected.  The papers stayed inside. I turned in my test. I bent to sign the turn in form. As I bent, I felt the papers shift.  The proctor cleared his throat and looked at me.  ""Thank you,"" he said, ""Have a good afternoon.""  I smiled and turned to go.  I walked out into the hall.  When I turned the corner into the main hall, I pulled the papers out of my coat.

I made it this time.  Whew.  Glad I didn't need to repeat my English experience even though I obviously haven't quite learned my lesson."

"event","I met Jane Yolen when I was in elementary school.  If you know who she is, you probably guess why I met her.  Yep, I was at the first of a couple of writing conferences I attended through elementary school.  

Boy, these were fun! Usually, teacher would announce that there was a writing conference.  He or she would have us write a story, and then the author of the ""best"" story would get to go.  I was selected sometimes for these conferences.  I got to meet really great authors like Jane Yolen.  I treasured that.  True confession:  I still do.  I have her autograph in my ""Girl's Treasure"" small cedar box I got at Glacier National Park when I was 8.  

I started thinking about this today when Josh sent me an email.  He was joking around, but he wrote, ""I hope you get a big paying job so I can be a house husband some day.""  Yeah, write.  But, near panic rose from my gut just thinking about having a big job and never being able to write.  

There it was:  the truth I've been stuffing away for my whole life.  I need to write--not just for publication.  Maybe not ever for publication.  Definitely for my soul.  It lives in me, and if I don't let it out it might kill me trying to get out.  I've simply got to figure a way to be a disciplined writer.  

It seems all good things are born of discipline.  I loved basketball, and still do, but the love fueled long on and off season practices and lots of summer sacrifices.  It was discipline at its heart.  

I've got to do this, though.  I feel like if I die before I've written what I want to write then I will have faced death too soon.  

When I have fears that I may cease to be before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain...(Keats)

So, the big question, as always, how?"

"event","Life has been busy this week, complicated by the fact we had a really late night on Saturday.  We drove to 1/2 way between our house and Seattle.  This point happens to be Longview, Washington and met our good friends for an afternoon of frivolity in Longview.  We were about ready to call it a night when we decided to go bowling.  Then we decided to go bowling again.  We got home at 1:30.  Then went to church the next day.  Ouch!  Joshie took a long nap on Sunday afternoon, but I was fired up about our plan to save money by not going to the local grocery store every day.  So I prepared meals all of Sunday afternoon.  Therefore, I never was able to catch up on sleep this week.  When I get overtired, it's hard for me to sleep.  Also, all the bad habits and ways of thinking that I fight come back.  For instance, I think I am fat and my husband doesn't love me.  I know it's illogical, but I still think it.  Oh vey!  I have to take care of myself!  My plan this weekend is to rest up so I can be mentally sound.  

So, aside from the Saturday late night, I also found out on Wednesday that the school which employs me will be shutting down the high school.  I teach at a K-12 school.  Next year it will be a 6-8 school.  We don't know who will get jobs at other schools in the district and who won't.  We won't find out until May which is a little late to search for teaching jobs.  I am starting the job hunting now.  They sky's the limit...I think we could move anywhere.  But, the thought of moving again kinda makes me nauseous.  I've moved every few years my whole life, and I want to be settled.  Not to mention the fact that we definitely have to move in two years so Josh can get his Master's.  I'm not worried about this, however.  I see possibility.  When life throws me these job curves, it usually results in good things, actually the best, most life-transformative things ever, in my life.  I'm ready for the new adventures in school teaching.  

Because they are shutting the school partially down, the news crews from Portland have been at school filming us.  The 7-8th graders saw the news crew out in the hallway, and they all desperately wanted to be on TV.  So, I invited the crew in to get some classroom footage.  My 7-8th grade English class was on TV last night.  We were TV legends.  The kids were so excited.  It was pretty fun.  

Also, last Sunday I was elected to be on the church board.  I am sort of excited about it, and I sort of think what was I thinking...yikes.  Half the time I don't even want to go to church.  Josh loves it, however.  I do like to go with him.  I wonder if it's bad to like church only because you like to be with your husband.  Probably not.  I do love God still, just not church so much.  Oh well.  It is what it is.   

I keep running.  I ran a modified run so Josh could run with me again today.  It was fun.  

So that's the most boring life update in the world.  I just don't have the energy to make it very interesting tonight.  

I cant' wait for spring!"

"event","I started running in September.  Oh how I've always hated to run. I've tolerated running for a purpose at times in my life, though.  ""When you run in basketball, there's a reason,"" I explained myself to my friends who tried to motivate me to join track.  ""But when you run in track the only reason for running is to simply run.  It's not worth it.  It's just torture.""  I took my mitt and sunflower seeds to the softball field instead.  That involved a lot of standing around waiting for some action while calling and taunting the batter from the other team.

In September Josh announced that he was creating a weight loss contest for himself.  He was going to try to lose ten pounds by Christmas, if he did he was going on a trip.  Given my propensity to weigh myself every morning and pretend my scale was my psychic fortune teller,  and then commit myself to  to having the kind of day it forecasted for me--good if my weight was down, downright awful and miserable if my weight was up--I opted out of the weight loss challenge.  Instead, I committed to a 13 week run/walk program.  If I completed the program, I was going to go on Josh's trip with him.  So commenced my running.  And, I made it.  I started out by running 30 seconds and walking for 4.5 minutes.  By the week after Thanksgiving, I was ready and I ran for 60 minutes straight.  

Somewhere in all of this running, my hatred dissolved into love and, dare I even suggest it, I cherished my thrice weekly run.  I can't explain why all of a sudden I love to run, but the truth is irrefutable.  Maybe I love running as an adult the same way some children come to love mushrooms--their taste buds simply change.  You've hated mushrooms all your life, but one day around your 31st birthday you wake up and realize that a mushroom hanging out in your fridge looks kinda good.  You try it again, and you like it.

All of this brings us to today:  the day when I finally talked Josh into running with me.  ""We can do whatever kind of run/walk combo you want,""  I persuaded, ""I think you will really enjoy it.""  We started by running for five and walking for one.  Josh made it through with flying colors.  ""Keep your arms tucked in,"" I blithely offered advice in my new position as running coach, ""it helps you conserve your energy.""  The next round, since Josh was showing some signs of fatigue, I suggested we run five, walk two.  After that round, I decided we should run four, walk two.  Finally, at round four, coach decided we should, ""Run three, walk two.  After all, Josh, you are coming off of sickness.""  At round six, Josh started to think that he couldn't make it.  As any good coach is apt to do, I started to encourage him and try to distract him from his pain.

""You can do it!"" I'd report, ""you're almost there!  You will feel so good when you are done!"" I'd immediately follow that with, ""So, where do you want to go this summer?  Let's talk about our summer plans.""  Josh would say a couple of panting sentences, and I'd announce, ""That's it! Time to walk.  You pretty much rock the world at this running thing, Josh.""  He'd smile, and get ready for the next round.

In this way, we made it home.  As we were walking our final round up the driveway, I told Josh, ""You know, the encouragement I gave to you today is what I give to myself, too.""  And I meant it.  I think we all should mean it, and do it, too."

"event","I picked up my Marine Corp brother at PDX on Friday.  He stayed with Josh and I on Friday night; we had a good time.  It was very nice for Josh and my bro to get to know one another.  Then, on Saturday, I whisked him to Spokane.  It took us three hours to go the first 100 miles--the roads weren't great.  I stayed on Sunday with my sister and her hubby and my 5 month old nephew.  Mom and Dad came down and we had a quick family Christmas with 3/5 siblings able to make it.  Sister 2 and her family are in North Carolina.  Sister 5 and her new boyfriend went to Virginia to visit his family.  Seeing my nephew was definitely the highlight for me.  He is a giggling, round mass of baby.  He is the chunkiest, happiest baby I have ever seen.  He has little fat rolls all over his body.  It is precious!  So, on Monday, braving another snow storm, I drove home.  I spent yesterday getting ready for Josh and I to celebrate Christmas today.  

I made spanakopita and green bean cassarolle for a late lunch.  Then we will go to church tonight to celebrate the end of the advent season.  We will come home and open gifts and have dessert.  I have the beginnings of an ulcer (probably all the stress/worry I've placed on myself) and so I can't have sugar, alcohol, coffee or tomatoes.  So, I made a sugar free dessert.  I think it will be good.  

Tomorrow we were thinking about going to Josh's family, but I think the roads might be too bad. Plan B is Christmas with our good friends here in the WS.  I'm excited either way.  

My very favorite part of the season this year has been our advent wreath.  Each night Josh and I light the appropriate candles and pray.  Advent is a season of light coming; of expecting the light.  I feel like the Divine has shed light in my heart this advent.  Just as light increases up until the time of the coming of Christ, so light has increased in my heart.  This is how:  I am learning to love again.  No, my life isn't perfect.  It's not what I expected.  But, I have a core of friends here that I want to love.  I have a wonderful husband to love with abandon.  Bottom line, my lesson is I want to give love in every moment to the people who surround me.  I want to look at the positives and stand in the place of possibility instead of in fear.  I want to be the light of Christ in others' lives.  

Merry, merry Christmas!"

"event","LOML had his Christmas concert tonight.  So, it was a busy day dor me, too.  I went to my prayer group after work, and then rushed home.  I prayed vespers with Josh, and then I had a delicious and nutritious dinner of Wheat Thins while simultaneously doing the dishes which included a large spaghetti pot that had been emptied this morning to create my lunch.  I rather hat washing large pots of stuck on ickiness.  

Although an unconventional dinner, the wheat thins proved enough fueld to propel me through the evening.  Upon arrival at the middle school, I made up the programs for the concert.  This event proves that spending ten months working at WSU Rotunda as a clerical type person pays dividends later in life.  Not only did I get to refine my flirting skills, (*wink*) I also became adept at all things Microsoft.  

After practicing my program making skills, I also got to practice my ""princess wave.""  Josh thanked me from the microphone in front of everyone.  This thank you included a ""Where's hittingcenter?""  So, I got to wave to the crowd.  :)  It was fun.  I liked it!  

After the students played and sang, I waited for Josh and his select co-workers to clean up.  This enabled me to practice my plunking on the piano skills.  In the band room, I plunked out alto parts so I could sing them.  I am trying to learn to be a ""good alto.""  It may be a lost cause as I can never tell when I am on or off pitch.  LOML assures me that only like .1% of the population is acutally tone deaf.  I couldn't possibly be one of the tone deaf people in the world.  However, after weeks (almost a year!) of not being able to match pitch like at all, I'm thinking I might be part of the tone deaf crowd.  I think that exempts me from other unlikely events like getting struck by lightening or winning millions in the lottery.

All this excitement in my evening has me up WAY too late.  It's 1/2 hour past the time I need to be asleep, an hour past the time I need to be in bed.  And I'm hyper.  Maybe it's the Wheat Thins."

"event","Some stuff I want to remember when I look back at this page a year from now:

1.  I am on week 10 of my 13 week walk to run program.  :)  I am proud of myself for that.  Plus, I have not been walking/running with music. I have been trying to focus my mind while I run instead.

2.  Josh offered to work for one more year so I could take a year off to write.  I think that's sweet.  I think after a few more years I might take him up on it.  For now, though, I just need to write while I work.  

3.  Today is rainy and foggy.  Every time it's rainy and foggy and I'm teaching I say to students, ""On days like today I just want to curl up with a book and some coffee and read all day.""  So, today's my day!

4.  Josh is applying to seminaries.  I am editing his essays and giving him writing advice from an English teacher's perspective.  He says that if he gets in he's buying me two outfits from my favorite place to get clothes in Hood River.  This is not something I would typicallydo for myself, so I'm praying Josh gets in.  I want those clothes! :)

5.  I had an instant where I knew what it would be like to be a mom.  At school last week students followed me into the bathroom to ask me a ""super important"" question.  Really?!  The bathroom?  It couldn't wait three minutes?  

6.  My students are really enjoying reading Sherman Alexie.  It's fabulous...they go into the library and try to check out all the Sherman Alexie books.  There aren't any, but the librarian is going to buy some. 

7.  ""Everything is a story.  Everyone has a story.  Listen to the stories.  We all have beauty in our cultures.  All of us.  And in the effort to protect ourselves we just operate with hatred and our ears closed.  Listen to other people.""  (Sherman Alexie)

8.  I thought yesterday, ""I love church.""  What?  Can't believe I thought that.  Weird.

9.  A friend's toddler calls all flying things ""bees.""  (Butterflys, moths, flies, all bees.)  I think that is adorable.  

10.  I have three beautiful nephews.  They bring my joy all the time.  They delight my heart.  I love, love, love, love, love being an auntie.  Oh, and sister #3 in our family took her 3-month old sons's picture with the news paper that had Obama on the cover after he won.  That nephew of mine is part African-American--that's why.  Mama was filled with hope for her son after Obama won.  Nephew's first election in the world...hope inspiring.  Makes me tear up even now.  Yes, we can!"

"event","Today I started 7-8th grade English by talking, very quickly, about thesis sentences.  When I giving instruction, I tend to speak really, really quickly.  This was one of those days--I get excited about English.  Yes, even thesis sentences.  Noticing that I was talking really quickly, I commented to the students that I noticed I was really talking quickly.  They agreed, and then I told them that I could go even faster; I then recited my ""Betty Boughter"" toungue twister.  I am so good at that thing; it's always impressive to 12 year olds.   Then, I told a joke.  It goes like this: 

Joke Teller:  I bet I can make you say blue.

Joke Hearer:  No you can't (or something to this effect).

JT:  What color is a green light?

JH:  Green.

JT:  I told you I could make you say green.

JH:  You said blue!

JT:  See.

Oh, it was so funny to the students (and to me!).  Then, we got busy with our beautiful lesson on thesis statements and introductory paragraphs.  After the students wrote several amazing sentences, we moved on to reading.  We were discussing what makes someone trustworthy in preparation for the reading.  One student said that he trusts one friend because she doesn't speak English.""  Another student asked, ""Does she speak 
Mexican?""  A Hispanic student who is normally very quiet authoritatively said, ""Mexican isn't a language.  It's a race.  Spanish is a language.""  Then, we discussed this vital difference as a class.  I think we gained respect.  And I am so thrilled that a student was able to speak up for himself.  I am not thrilled that he was hurt or offended; however, I also realize that this is how life goes sometimes.  Knowing how to speak up for one's self is an important life skill.  All of this was done with respect for others, too.  I think that we are making progress in caring for one another and ourselves.  This is why I teach."

"event","It's the end of quarter one week two.  It's good at school; year three is going nicely.  So far, so good.  The kids I teach are extremely well behaved.  They are polite, respectful, and they do what I ask.  Always.  It's kinda surreal.  I think I may actually be on mars.

I'm really busy.  It's hard to have six classes to teach.  It takes a lot of effor to get all of that together.  Plus, I am a mentor teacher to some new teachers so that takes a lot of my prep time.  I'm also conducting a research study on the perceived effects of teaching multi-cultural literature in a rural classroom. It's so busy.  I feel like I may implode.  But I won't.  As Tolkein says, ""Little by little one travels far.""  

Then there are the pies.  I said I would make pies every freaking week to raise money for a mission trip to Ecuador.  I was going to go, but it doesn't look like I am now.  I am still going to help raise money, though.  I'm thinking what did I get myself into becuase I do like to make pies.  However, I am not a pie expert.  I'm worried everyone will hate my pies.  It will so suck.  Then everyone at church will talk bad behind my back about how much my pies suck.  That would be horrible.  However, I shouldn't worry about it becuase I will never know about it if it were behind my back.  Also, I'm doing my best to help poor kids in Ecuador, so it's all good.  I should stop flipping out.  If people really have nothing better to do than gossip about me, then they need to bake some pies.  So take that!

So, one way I reduce my stress is by running.  I've started a 13 week run/walk program.  I am super duper excited about this.  The first week you run 30 seconds and walk 4 1/2 minutes.  The second week you run one minute and walk four.  The third week you run 1 1/2 minutes and walk 3 1/2.  I'm on week two, and I am going to make it to week 13.  It ends with a sixty minute run.  I can't even imagine running that long.  I love this challenge.  It is so good.  What's weird to me is that I feel guilty taking time for myself.  I feel like I should be grading, cooking, cleaning, calling people on the phone or just generally making others' lives more comfortable.  It is so important that I take time for myself, though.  I need to be healthy mentally and physically. 

Josh is really struggling at school.  He just really doesn't like teaching.  This is his last year (don't tell anyone; the cat's not out of the bag yet), so that is good.  I tell you what getting through this year might be a miracle for both of us.  He gets super depressed by the end of the week.  Today I really worked at cheering him.  Probably not the most healthy thing.  I guess I shouldn't do that becuase he needs to do what he needs to do for himself.  However, I did.  The upshoot is he is great now, but I am exhausted.  Now Go figure.  Mensch!  

Also today I-84 was closed because of a fire, so I couldn't get home for 2 hours.  I was 2 hours late getting home.  So, I had chips and bean dip for dinner.  Not the best choice I've ever made.  However, it is also not the worst.  The worst might have been ice cream followed by peanutbutter cups and a whole bottle of dessert wine from Maryhill.  

So there's my daily pep talk for myself. I feeling kinda angry tonight; not sure why.  Actually I do.  I'm disappointed.  It's masking as anger.  Don't know what to do about it except name it and wait for it to roll on.  Just like 'Pac:  everyday gotta roll on.  Or, I could go listen to Def Leppard and Aerosmith.  They always make me laugh.  Pour Some Sugar on Me anyone?

I feel better already!"

"event","Malaria is the number one killer in African nations; sadly babies and young children are most susceptable.  Malaria, we in the US know, is completely preventable.  In fact, we have mostly eradicated Malaria here.  Of course, aalaria is more a tropical disease, so maybe we had less work to do.  Since mosquitos transmit malaria and other diseases, one effective tool in the fight against malaria are mosquito nets.  Mosquito nets cost about ten dollars each, which is not a lot of money for us.  It is a lot of money for poor African citizens.  

Last night a group of church friends and I held a fundraiser.  On the first Friday of every month, Hood River has an event called, appropriately, ""First Friday.""  Basically all the businesses are open later and have free food.  Lots of restaurants have bands playing.  It's just a way for people to get out and buy stuff and have a good time.  My friends and I set up a booth downtown.  We made ice cream sundaes and accepted donations to go toward buying malaria nets.  

We tirelessly scooped ice cream from four to eight.  It's not like scooping ice cream takes a lot of energy, so we made it through with flying colors.  Actually, I was super tired of standing up becuase I don't have my ""school legs"" yet.  Nevertheless, I had so much fun; the only problem for me with this kind of thing is that I never want the party to be over.  By the end of the night, we had made $170.00.  Wow!  We can now buy 17 malaria nets for children and babies in Africa.  I'm so excited about this.   Did I literally save 17 lives, maybe.  Not everyone who contracts malaria dies from it.  But some do.  So I potentially saved some lives.  I definitely made 17 lives much easier, helped 17 moms rest easier at night knowing thier children are protected.  The bonus is many more people know about malaria nets, too.  Maybe this fundraiser will ripple out and have even more impact."

"event","Today was the day:  the official (for teachers) beginning of the next school year.  This is my eighth year as an English/reading/whatever-else teacher.  I can hardly believe I have been teaching for eight years.  That just seems like a long time.  This means that I have been teaching for as long as Bush has been president, give or take.  I also remember my first year of teaching was 2001, and one of the first incidents that happened was 9-11.  

I have been recruited to be a mentor teacher this year (not to a student teacher, but to a brand new teacher who will be in our building this year).  I started off today with mentor teacher training, and they prompted us to think back to our first year of teaching.  I think that is why I started thinking about all my teaching years.

I'm still in love with the journey and the process.  I still have tons to learn.  I'm still putting one foot down in front of the other.  I'm still trying to ward off cynicism, so far successfully.  I still hope that I make a difference for at least some.  My main goal as a teacher is that each student would know she is valuable and loved as they are.  My second goal is to teach them tools to meet thier own needs. First, the self reflection tools necessary to understand whay they need.  Secondly the ability to get what they need to meet thier own needs.  

At any rate, I still love teaching."

"event","I've been inspired by some fellow posters who manage a post every day.  This is my attempt at posting every day.  I know that all my fabulous, dedicated readers want not only to learn the minutia of my daily life, they would also like to know what I write about when I can't think of anything about of which to write.  (Narrowly escaped the dangling preposition there.)

Case in point:  When in topic-lack land, blog about prepositions.  First, prepositions can be found in either subject or predicate in a sentence.  They can pop up anywhere!  They are sort of like weeds in one's garden--when you least expect it, it will pop up and make it's self annoying.  You won't find fruit in a weed.  I mean, you can't pluck a plump tomato from a weed growing next to a tomato.  You also cannot pluck a subject or verb from a pesky preposition pleasantly protruding from the ground next to said subject or verb.  Also, technically (but I don't edit for this except for in rare cases as I'm not a dangling preposition hunter despite what many students may believe) you aren't ""supposed"" to end a sentence with a preposition.  This is how prepositions function as a guru of gymnastics/coach might also function.  They require one to perform many dangerous aerobic and acrobatic moves to avoid ending a sentence with a preposition.  Sometimes one must tumble, twist, and connive to avoid those pesky dangling prepositions.  As I said before, annoying little suckers.  No other way to put it.  

So, there you have it.  A paragraph about prepositions.  Hey, at least I kept my roll.  So, lucky you.  Hopefully something bloggable happens tomorrow.  Otherwise I may be forced to write about alliteration.  It's one of my favorite topics.  (Wink)"

"event","We made it back from our Mt. Adams adventure.  It was stunning, as always.  We came back lickity split becuase we both were ready to come home.  So we stayed overnight...but not longer.  We both wanted to read and walk today; these are both things more easily done in the comfort of home.  It was a great trip, though becuase now we have a spot we can easily go back to spur the moment.  Plus, I'm making one of my big plastic bins into our camping bin so we can just pull it out and grab some food and go.  We need need everything I had packed.  We could have even used more--more blankets.  We both spent the night shivering.  Then again, isn't that the joy of camping?  It's all part of the fun, right?

The best part:  Shorthorn Trail up Mt. Adams

Josh and I started walking up a southwestern face of Mt. Adams:  Shorthorn trail.  The trail was lush with long, clumpy grass.  Great watchful trees loomed overhead and occasional wildflowers waved hello.  The trail alternated between steep and level as we wound our way up the mountain.  Under one log we found a patch of hard-ice snow left over from the ice pack.  This snow may be perpetual: never managing to melt before the early fall snow starts all over again.  

Being in nature, especially on trails, is always incredibly refreshing to me.  I understand how nature reveals God.  This always sounds so trite to me, and I don't mean it tritely.  I do feel so close to God on the mountain, in nature.  The earth giving birth to new life, and sustaining the old life through all the changes and chances.  I imagine all the trees have seen--aboriginal Americans, us....so much snow, rain, wind, volcanoes erupting!

Mt. Adams has a flat top.  Native American stories tell us that at one time Mt. Adams had a pointed top like Mt. Hood.  One day, she blew--just like Mt. St. Helens.  We weren't around for that, but the Native Americans were.  So were the trees.  History lodged in branches; time wound in rings holding the parts of tree together.  Amazing."

Josh said that he lacked the creative energy to plan the trip, so I took over.  I used the maps and found a campsite and then google mapped my way in.  I made tiny replica maps on post-it notes, and I feel pretty confident that I can matrix us in.  Yeah!  I guess that summer of plotting Craig Mountain area farm ownership using township and range came in handy.  I'm pretty proud of myself.

The only conflict we have now is that Josh thinks I over packed.  Which I say if you don't like the packing, do it yourself.  :)  Oh, vey.  Don't worry, I haven't said this to him yet.  We will work through this conflict, too.  I'm sure.

"event","Chicago is a city of so-called good and bad.  I suppose this is the story of every city:  the good parts, the bad parts.  Yesterday, Josh and ventured farther south and farther west in Chicago to Humboldt Park.  This area of town is 70% Hispanic (58% Puerto Rican), 27% African American, and 3% White/Other.  I feel the need to be part of the minority group; I think it is an experience we all should have once in a while.  When the chance arose to park of the 3% white/other group I had to snatch it despite some trepidation.

We took the bus down south of Lincoln Park until we got to the Humboldt area.  We found a small PR restaurant and ordered mashed plantain and a bean salad.  The food was wonderful!  The family next to us in the restaurant sang along to the PR music coming over the loudspeakers.  People milled around the restaurant coming and going and exchanging kisses.   

Finally we went to the park and watched ""Flags of Steel""--a local documentary film about the production and installation of the steel Puerto Rican flag at the entrance to the Humboldt area.  We made our way back to the land of Lincoln.  I'm glad we got a change to experience being part of the ""other"" group.

This morning we went to the black Episcopal church a little farther on the south side in Bronzeville.  It was also a chance to be the other.  We were conspicuous as the only white people in the church.  People were friendly and warm and welcomed us to worship.

I have always felt called to be a bridge between groups.  I think this is where it begins--in church.  If we can't worship God together, what hope do we have?  Are we really children of the same God, brothers in Jesus?  That is what I want to know.  You know, though, I learned something about this, too.  I have been looking for the face of Christ in all whom I meet, whether in church or not.  I think we are all brothers and sisters in humanity.  We need to be able to find the common ground and see the face of Christ in people who are different.  At least I do; I need every chance I get to practice this skill.  Sometimes  I have to admit I get scared by my preconceptions (and a healthy dose media bias and fear mongering?) and it's sometimes difficult for me to get out of my comfort zone.  Every time I do I am blessed.  I am blessed to be united to all of humanity.  I am blessed to change my perspective.  I am blessed to meet Christ again in the face of someone new.  My prayer is that someone else will be blessed to find in this privileged white girl  the face of Christ, too."

"event","Josh and I have been in the Lincoln Park neighborhood in Chicago since Tuesday.  Here's a list of the stuff we've done.  Don't feel compelled to read; this is mostly for my remembrance later.

Tuesday:  Get into Chi at around 2.  Get lost trying to find the El from the Amtrak station. We finally find it and get to Diversy street.  Walk to our apartment....it's a long walk and the luggage kept hitting me in the back of the leg.  Now I have a very large bruise.  We are starving at this point, so we walk along Diversy looking for a place to eat.  As we walk by a Persian restaurant the owner pulls us in a tells us we won't be disappointed.  We eat there, and he was right!  It was the most delicious food, and we got free baklava.  Next, we went to the Cubs game and saw the Cubs beat the Reds.  It was super fun to be at Wrigley field.  Quite an experience!

Wednesday:  Head to lake for a swim.  It's cold, so we only stay for about 3 minutes.  On our way back, we stopped by Lincoln Park Zoo.  I loved seeing all the animals, but I especially loved the big cats.  They had lions and tigers and leopards.  Oh my!  When we got back from the Zoo, we headed to Evanston because I wanted to see what Josh was up to all last summer.  (He went to school in Evanston.)  Later that night we saw the Chicago Symphony Orchestra with Joshua Bell in Evanston.  It was an outdoor concert, picnic style.  It was a lot of fun!  

Thursday:  First, we went back to the zoo.  I really love that place!  Then we went to church in downtown Chicago.  Next, we headed to China Town to get a bubble tea.  I wasn't too impressed with bubble tea.  I can't handle the tapioca pearls.  I couldn't even drink mine.  Then we went to Wrigleyville to get some Chicago pizza and watch the Cubs lose to the Reds on TV.  Bummer, but the pizza was good.  After that, it was super rainy and stormy so we just went back the apartment and chilled.

Friday:  First, we headed to Michigan Ave and took in the sights and sounds.  We looked in some stores, etc.  Next we went to noon time church again.  Then we ate another dose of Chicago pizza for lunch.  We went to the Natural Science museum.  I got in free becuase I had my teacher ID.  That was cool.  Then we walked all the way back down Michigan Ave. via Buckingham Fountain.  It took us forever to get back home!  But we did, and we had dinner at home and then went out for some Cold Stone icecream.  

So, today, we are going to go to Humboldt Park (the Peurto Rican area) to catch a free showing of a Peurto Rican movie.  That should be another adventure!

Some interesting things:
I found a cell phone on the beach and hit the green button twice to call the last person called.  Sure enough, the people were still at the beach and came and collected the missing phone.  Josh's idea was to call the ""mom"" number...

A homeless guy died in the alley by the Starbucks while we were there.  That was not cool.  The ambulance came and got him.  

We were walking and a guy asked us for money.  Josh told him we didn't have cash, but he would buy him dinner.  So we took him to Taco Bell, and he ordered ten tacos for ten dollars.  I guess I would too if that is all I was going to eat for a while.  

I signed up for GreenPeace cause I couldn't say no to the signer upper.  Have to work on my assertiveness.

I don't know if I can live in a city becuase it seems too heartbreaking.  I can't go anywhere without my heart breaking a little bit or a lot.  Homeless people wanting money (I don't blame them), people obviously down on their luck...such much poverty and hard situations.  I'm so lucky.  It breaks my heart."

After that we are headed up to the Chi for a week of vacation.  Just the two of us, we can make it if we try, just the two of us, you and I.  

So far the train ride has been a memorable experience.  We have been on the train for about 27 hours.  It's a little difficult to sleep, but I have managed pretty well.  I did visit with an oder gentleman.  He lost his wife and now has a great time traveling around.  His words were he ""drinks and goes to casinos.""

Ah, what vanity still resides in my soul.  Might always--this might be a terminal condition.  

We had dinner in the diner car tonight.  We brought a styrofoam cooler.  As expected, it has been next to impossilbe to keep it filled with ice.  It has already cracked.  That's fun.  It's also why we decided to have dinner in the diner car tonight.  We met a railroad manager and his ballerina wife there.  They have moved all over the country getting different railroad jobs.  She opened up a ballet school in Glasgow, MT.  What if she slowly opened ballet schools wherever she went?  Wouldn't that make a lovely short story."

I already had mini dahlias, pansies, gerbera daisies, and normal dahlias growing.  However, since the pansies are still doing really well it's a bad sign for the bright red tomatoes.  

Today I used the rosemary to make rosemary focaccia.  It turned out simply delightful.  There is something about fresh herbs that makes everything so much better.  Next, we had some bananas on the bad side, so I made banana bread.  This is day two of my summer; I baked.  I loved it!  Well, I baked in between three chapters from my ""Building Classroom Discipline"" book.  I am taking two classes this summer.  Also, since I am the yearbook advisor I have to finish up the yearbook and get that sent off this week.  So, I guess technically I'm not on vacation yet.  I am battling resentment about the yearbook.  So far I am successfully battling it off.  So it goes...

Saturday, Josh and I take the train to Michigan to see his family (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins).  We get back, via plane, on July 16.  Then, in a couple of days it's off to Ritzville.  My sister from NC and her two boys will be there.  My brother recently back from Iraq will be there.  And, drumroll please, our middle sister's first child will make his initial appearance.  She will be having a baby boy.  He's due July 16.  So exciting!  So far we have three nephews, no nieces.  Hmmm.  Then, we'll go to Craigmont, Id to see Josh's immediate family and my grandparents.  I think we'll camp along a river.  We haven't decided which one yet.  I'm lobbying for the Selway.  My 16 year old brother in law is lobbying for the Salmon.

"event","I lived on a Native American reservation for almost three years.  Well, to be honest I lived on the reservation for longer than that.  It's a long historical narrative that I won't go into right now, but actually I was born on a white town on the reservation and lived there for 8 years before my family moved.  Then, in high school my family moved back to that town and I graduated from high school there.  But I'm not writing of those times this morning.  I'm writing of the time I lived in the Native American town which is at the heart of the reservation and taught middle school English.  

The school where I taught was 85% free and reduced price lunch, and 85% Native American.  Poverty seemed to seep from the cracks in between the school cinder blocks.  Kids went hungry.  Houses went un-fixed:  no water sometimes.  People struggled to exist and to live.  

This was my first real experience with real, deep, lasting, generational poverty.  I saw no way out for my students, for families, for the cultural tradition of Native America.  I also saw how poverty--the deep, grimy, generational poverty I encountered--sunk its roots deep into everything.  It is a noxious weed that never quite disappears.  You can pull it out, but it always seems to come back.

I wept.  I wept daily at first for the things I couldn't change and the things I couldn't make right.  I wept for the children and the moms and dads.  I wept for the poverty--real and deep and immutable.  Then I prayed.  I prayed always for God to take away the poverty.  I so wanted him to somehow make it right and good and holy again."

"event","Joan Chittister:  ""If prayer is not a spiritual vending machine, it is also not meant to be an escape from life.  Every spiritual faddist wants it to be so, of course.  But if prayer becomes the way we give ourselves permission to escape the life around us, it is not prayer...Our greatest mystics were our most real people, our hardest workers, our most feeling exemplars of what it means to live life fully.  Dorothy Day, Mahatma Gandhi, MLK, Jr. lived in God and wept with the people around them.  

Maybe we are forgetting to center ourselves in the consciousness of the God who is conscious of all of us.  Maybe that's why the world today is in the throes of such brutal violence, such inhuman poverty, such unconscionable discrimination, such self-righteous fundamentalism.  Maybe we are forgetting to pray, not for what we want, but for the sight, the enlightenment God wants to give us"" (Joan Chittister, 2004, p. 47-48).  

I've been struggling to pray.  So often I just don't want to.  I realize that it is so important because it helps me to see how God sees.  It gives me mission, vision, and reminds me of why I am doing what I am doing.  To stop, to pause, and to see my self, God, and the world honestly is a great call.  Maybe when I pray it does make a difference to this world.  Maybe prayer can stem the tide of all that is so egregious."

We decided to go to church in Portland today instead of going to our church in Hood River.  So, after we go ready....

coffee.

Next, we drove to Portland and went to church at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral.  It was a beautiful service.  I especially enjoyed the message.  The preacher told us how unfruitful and pointless worry is.  It was a great message for me since I had been so worried about my dad.  The text for the sermon was the passage where Jesus says that the birds don't worry, and they are cared for.  The lillies don't worry, and they are more beautiful than all of Solomon's splendor.  It was a great message for me.  I always marvel at how the message always seems to be what I need to hear.  They also had a beautiful choir.  It was amazing.  Here is what Trinity looks like on the outside:

Next stop:  the train station to buy tickets.  We chose to walk to the train station.  It was about 1 mile, so not too far.  I love walking in this part of Portland.

We then walked back to our car.  This time we walked up Morrison (3rd to 19th)  Morrison is a very cool street--lots of cute clothes shops, ethnic food, and quirky coffee shops. I will definitely need to explore Morrison some more.  We collect Starbucks mugs.  We didn't have a Portland mug yet, so we stopped at the Morrison Ave. Starbucks to get a mug.

We made it to our car and drove out of the city.  We passed by Portland's MLK Drive and I snapped a shot of the road sign.  You can barely make it out.

"event","This all started when I decided to lose weight.  I remember the morning clearly.  I had resisted losing weight because I didn't want to lose weight to make society happy or to conform to some sort of ideal.  I thought I could love myself as I was.  If other people couldn't, that was their business, not mine.  Then, one morning in the school library I read that overweight women had a higher propensity for diseases:  cancer, heart diesease, asthma, diabetes...you get the picture.  So, I decided maybe I would try to lose weight to be healthy.  I started by putting myself on Weight Watchers.  I lost weight, on my own, until I lost about 60 pounds.  Then, I actually officially joined Weight Watchers for the end of my weight loss journey.  (I decided to officially join because then I could have ""lifetime membership"").  At any rate, my Weight Watcher's leader and I set my goal for ten pounds.  I reached my goal.  Then I thought that losing just a bit more would be good because I wouldn't have trouble at my weigh in.  At Weight Watchers you weigh in; if you are not more than two pounds over your goal weight you don't have to pay for the meeting.  If you are, you do.  So, I lost just five more pounds.  

Then, the craziness started.  First, I decided to go on a seven day fast with my pastor's wife.  Which I did.  This brought my weight down another ten pounds.  I thought this was great!  I had heard somewhere that 5'10"" models weigh about 136 pounds.  You can probably guess what happened next:  yep, I tried to get down to 136.  Soon after my seven day fast I met my husband.  Then, I was terrified of gaining weight becuase I thought that if I did my husband wouldn't find me attractive anymore.  So, I started eating 10 points--600-700 calories per day.  When I had my body fat tested it was at 12-14%. I thought that was too high. 

I had some physical side effects:  my period stopped, I was cold all the time, I had trouble thinking sometimes. I had some large emotional side effects.  I became obsessed with my weight and eating.  I constantly compared my weight on height/weight charts and calculated my BMI ad infinitum.  I found a chart online that told you what percentile your weight was for the general population. I was in the 10th percentile for my height.  That is to say in a room of 10 women my height only 1 would weigh less than I did.  I became terrified of eating.  I remember one time I went up to see Josh at Theta Chi.  When I got there he was eating a piece of pumpkin pie.  He offered me a bite, and I refused.  He kept trying to get me to eat a bite of pie.  I adamantly refused and ending up crying and saying, through my tears, ""Please don't make me eat a bit of pie.""  It was a fate that was unthinkable:  a bite of pie. My eating habits were very unhealthy.  I drank a lot of diet pop, coffee, and other drinks sweetened with fake sugar.  I chewed a lot of sugar free gum.  I ate so many carrots my grandma and my friends thought my skin was turning orange.  Several people asked if I was sick.  My dad asked me if I was too thin.  

The worst part, I think now, of this was that during this time I was teaching 7-8th grade girls.  They watched me lose weight and keep losing weight.  One time I remember a conversation I had in class.  I was writing a model paper for the students on the overhead.  It was about my running schedule and running goals.  One student commented, ""You would be a stick if you did that.""  A second student answered, ""She already is.""  I saw some other students at UI that summer.  They were there for Upward Bound, and I was taking summer school classes.  They saw me and said, ""Miss Schaeffer, you are a scarecrow!""  I was a bad influence on those girls.

The thing I noticed most was that my weight was never low enough. I always wanted to lose just a couple more pounds.  I was never satisfied.  I never thought I looked good enough.  It was never enough.

A couple of months before I got married, I went on birth control pills.  They made maintaining my weight almost impossible.  So, I gained weight.   For three years now I've struggled with this.  I knew intellectually that I was too thin if I wasn't even having a period.  I knew spiritually I was damaging myself:  when I was very thin I thought I was better than when I was heavier.  I got all my worth from the scale.  However, this was not enough to flip the switch in my mind.  I tried losing weight, but I could never really get as low as I wanted.  (This probably has to do with the way I messed up my metabolism by not eating much about four years ago.)  So, for three years I have been struggling with myself and my weight.  I had desperately wanted it to be lower so I could be happy with myself.  I constantly asked Josh if he liked me still.  (Of couse he did.  In a funny twist of life, he didn't think I looked that great when we met--I was too skinny. He liked me for who I was on the iside.  I'm so glad I have a great husband!)  

Lately, I've been seeing a counselor.  My weight issues are one of the things we talk about.  Spiritually, I've been learning to love myself as the Divine loves me.  I been realizing that I am worthy and loveable because I am a child of God.  That is all, no matter what the scale says.  My therapist tells me that a scale is just a number:  we judge our weight to see if it is healthy or not by how we feel.  Are we putting good food into our body?  Are we getting enough healthy exercise?  It's not about how we look or the numbers.  It's about our health.  Every one is different; everyone has a different weight that is healthy for him or her.  She also encouraged me to talk to a doctor about my weight.  

Last Monday at my annual exam I talk to my doctor about my weight.  She said that I am at a healthy weight for my body.  She also said that becuase of my bone structure and muscle mass that if I lost over ten pounds it would be too much to lose.  It was the right time in my life to hear that message.  I'd already been working on loving myself and knowing myself, so I could hear what she had to say.  And, I'm happy with me.  I'm healthy, and I'm at a healthy weight for my body.  That's all I need.  I'm getting less and less worried about what celebrities weigh, what the number on the scale is, or what size I wear.  I am beautiful just as I am.  I am healthy.  My body has been so good to me, and I am going to be good to my body.  

Finally, I write this for myself.  It helps me to tell my stoires:  it generally is the last stage of healing for me.  Once I am ready to write and I write something down, then my mind can really release it.  This is my journey.  I spent too many years obsessed with a number on a scale.  These are years I could've put my energy to something more productive.  Since last Monday, I've made a new rule for myself:  I can no longer call myself fat.  I have empirical evidence that word is not an apt description of me.  I used to call myself that name nearly every day.  

Now I call myself beautiful, accepted, and worthy.  These are the true words.  

(PS:  I have a feeling I am not the only woman who has struggled with this issue.  In fact, I think nearly every woman has struggled with this issue.  It's a huge problem in our society.  So, to all the women out there:  be strong.  You are beautiful, worthy, and accepted becuase you are a creation of God.  There is no other measuring tool that has a right to tell you otherwise.)"

"event","I had some to kill on Friday in class, so I told the students they could each tell one school appropriate joke if they wanted to do so.  Many kids took me up on this, and they told some pretty funny jokes.  I honestly was just killing time, and I was tired of hearing myself talk.  After class, however, as I reflected on my day I realized something about telling jokes.  It had some great benefits.  They follow:

1.  It created community in my classroom.  You build relationships when you laugh together.  Community, I believe is the foundation of true democratic education (which is what public schools are ""supposed"" to be practicing).

2.  It encouraged students to give mini speeches.  Sometimes students struggle with standing up in front of their peers and giving speeches.  This is a first small step which will help them do that.  That's good.

These are two great products of my time killing.  I think I'll do some more.  I'm just joking; I try to jam every minute full of activities.  It is ironic that sometimes I plan and plan and don't get very good results, and when I fly by the seat of my pants, I do.  To be fair, I over plan all the time and I usually get fair (at least) results from my planning.  I often get great results from my planning.  I, obviously, sometimes get great results from not planning."

"event","It is so amazing...spring has come to the Gorge one more time. I have planted four pansies in pots on my porch.  There are small dark and light purple flowers lining the driveway.  Our tree out front is bursting with large pink blossoms.  It lifts my sprits!  It is 7:30, and the light is just now fading from behind Mt. Hood.  I so enjoy the lighter time of year.  I am eagerly awaiting the next flowers that will bloom.  What will come up next?  Every day is an adventure in blooms, that's for sure.  Now, I just want the weather to become warmer.  I want to be able to wear sandals without my toes going numb from cold.  Wouldn't that be amazing?  

Palm Sunday today was gorgeous at church.  One thing I really like about attending a liturgical church is the liturgical calendar.  Palm Sunday is bursting with metaphor.  The pastor wore a red robe today, the altar covering is red, and there are no flowers.  This is all in honor of the death of Christ.  We read the passion from Matthew as a congregation.  We spoke words about the sacrifice of Christ on the cross.  It is all made richer by the blood red imagery that fills the sanctuary.  On Thursday, we will meet again in the dark (at 8:00 pm) to remember our story--the story of the exodus from Egypt, Ezekial's dry bones, Isaiah's prophecies about the Christ, and Christ's sacrifice.  Then, finally on Sunday, in the light both natural and of the resurrection of Christ, we will celebrate Jesus' ressurection in our life.  The altar cover and pastor's robe will be brilliant white.  I love this liturgy.  

On a side note, I have joined the church choir even though I struggle with singing.  The church choir director kept pestering me to join, and he ended up being pretty persuasive.  I know this guy really well (wink, wink--he's my husband) so I was able to broker a deal to join choir.  Surprisingly, I have enjoyed it.  We are singing a song by Palestrina (Jesu, rex admirabilis).  It is difficult, but I made a track of it on Garage Band on LOML's Mac.  Then I replay my part over and over and over.  I have put hours of practice into this alto part.  Ok, not hours and hours.  Just hours.  Like two or three.  I finally have it down, and it sounds beautiful.  Palestrina was a great composer in my estimation.  

I think, too, that a certain one of my friends will be intersted to know I am learning some music theory along the way.  I got a huge lesson in music theory and understand the key of D minor much better.  It's really fascinating.  

The light is gone from behind Mt. Hood now.  It reminds me of the liturgy of Palm Sunday--the light of Christ will be fading this week.  However, I am convinced the light will reappear behind Mt. Hood tomorrow.  Even so, the light of my savior continually reappears in my life--resurrection Sunday comes often for me.  It is also necessary that crucifixion Friday come often.  This is the cycle of life.  As for me, I am in the middle of Easter right now.  I think I'll enjoy it.

Blessings to all of you during this Easter season, as well.  May you find the light and warmth of the newly dawning spring sun and the risen Christ."

The dream is still alive, and the fight still needs to be fought.  This is the message that burns in my heart as I type tonight.  I am not trying to preach or to bring up heavy issues.  I care deeply about social justice because I care about our American dream; I want America to be the place where all children's dreams for equal opportunity can be realized. 

 This, to me, is about so much more than the American dream, however.  This need for social justice is about the Christian dream.  It's the dream of Jesus to me.  When I read my Bible, I see a Jesus who reached out to the unreachable, the unlovable, the unwanted and the scorned.  Jesus reached out to the tax collectors, prostitutes, lepers, children, and women.  This is the the kind of Christianity I have chosen to live, and I want to live it even more.  To reach out to those who are the ""have nots"" in our society.  Isn't this what a Christian nation would do?  Should do?  

I can't just profit and live comfortably and securely while many in our nation do not and cannot.  We need to change.  The old way is not working.  We have not been the nation we need to be or we profess to be.  I must stand up and word for social justice in any way I can."

"event","In the past three or so years, I have started listening to and enjoying Jazz.  LOML loves jazz:  plays jazz, listens to jazz, understands jazz, revels in jazz...you get the picture.  Since I've known him, my life has been likewise enriched by jazz.  My friend, P., who hails from Malaysia, also likes Jazz.  There is a great Jazz club in Portland called Jimmy Mak's.  Saturday night, P., Joshie and I went to Jimmy Mak's to hear a trumpet player Jazz it up.  I called ahead for reservations and got a table.  If you don't call for reservations at Jimmy Mak's you don't get in.  It's really busy all the time.  We sat at our table, and I noticed the table next to us had at 8:15 reservation.  One thing you should know about Jimmy Mak's is that it is crowded!  They cram in as many tables as they can and you end up being very smashed into your table/booth.  At 8:15 this couple shows up and sits down next to us.  I am sitting right next to the gentlemen...and I mean right next.  It's really crowded in Jimmy Mak's.  Due to the closeness of everyone, I start a conversation right up with the couple next door.  He ordered a drink I had never heard of before (this is just because I am naive, I'll admit that).  It comes in a small goblet tipped over and sat on a glass of warm water because this alcohol is best slightly warm.  I found all of this out because I asked the guy, ""What is that?"" He filled me in.  Time goes by, and he says sorry for the accidental hits that are inevitable when you sit so close.  The jazz was amazing.  The drummer was particularly amazing. He was from NYC (what!) and was hot on his drums.  Finally, the gentleman next door got up--shuffled past all of us, apologized for the upheaval, and walked to the back.  I thought he was going to the bathroom; we had all taken our turn at upheaving the table to go to the bathroom.  He wasn't going to the bathroom, though.  He was going to get his sax to sit in with the jazz band!  I couldn't believe it.  He played the most beautiful, soulful sax I've ever heard.  I actually had just finished telling LOML that I didn't like jazz sax very well.  I had to take it all back after he played.  It was so amazing and beautiful and moving.  His name is Devin Phillips--check him out on google or ITunes.  And, he sat next to me and taught me cervasea and loving the sax.  

PS When he sat back down, after this amazing performance, he asked the girl sitting with him how it was.  She said it was great, of course.  He said, ""No, it was not good, etc.""  This reminded me of LOML:  after he gets done performing Jazz I think it is beautiful, he thinks it is crap.  I think this is like all of us.  We all think we are crap when we are beautiful.  The Divine is beautiful.  Who are we to think that we are less than beautiful?  The Divine weaves her beautiful tapestry made from the varied pieces of our soul played out in jazz, in teaching, in learning, in mothering, in living and in growing. This is the beautiful darkness where Christ is born.  Come, let us adore him: living Sophia."

"event","Today was the first day back to school after a long Christmas break.  The kids were good, their teacher was happy, and it all rolled along fairly smoothly.  So that's good.  It is also my 31st birthday today.  It seems like two things are happening.  Primarily it seems that I am not really getting any older.  The numbers keep on ticking by, but I still feel really young.  It also seems that the age gap between my husband and I is increasing.  Somehow the distance between 31 and 25 (he will be on February 25) seems like a lot more than 29 to 23 (our ages when we got married).  It is a puzzle!  

All in all I had a really beautiful day today.  LOML got me a digital camera, and I will really appreciate it.  I love to take pictures and think this will be my new hobby.  My old digital got ruined when I took it to the beach in North Carolina and wind blew sand into it.  I should say the wind sand blasted sand into the camera.  It was totally embedded.  At the end of the the two best gifts were not material at all.  The first my husband gave to me and I don't even know if he is even aware of it.  He said to me, ""Give me the play by play of your day.""  I am sure my face lit up, and I did.  I have this uncanny ability to remember almost every minute detail of my day and love to retell each conversation complete with voice changes and vocal pauses.  It was a true gift to sit and listen to my whole day like that.  I usually make myself tell just one or two stories because I sincerely doubt anyone wants to hear my whole, entire play by play.  Joshie did.  It really made me feel very loved.  It was a lot of fun for me, too.  It reminds to be a good listener.  The second gift was what I gave to myself.  I thought today was a day I could be chilled out and happy.  I just was happy.  My life isn't perfect:  I have relationship problems and stuff.  Instead of letting it get me down, today I just was happy anyway.  I think I have stumbled upon a way to live my life.  Even in the middle of the bad, I am going to look for and celebrate the good as much as possible.  I am giving myself permission to just be happy even when I am working things out in my life.   

When I reflect back on this year, I realize that it is not the year I would have picked out.  I imagine myself shopping for years in a store.  I would have passed right on by this year.  It's easy to pass on major surgery, low, low. low blood and energy, major relationship difficulties, a grandfather passing away, car trouble and a husband in Chicago all summer.  However, I can also see that God always gives me what is best for me.  Looking back, I can see that this year has birthed within me true growth.  It's the kind that lasts, the kind that you can't ""backslide"" from because it has changed you completely from the inside out.  It's the kind of change I have waited for.  I have, I think, become content in these relationships where they are right now.  Joan Chittister writes about the will of God being that which remains after we have prayed for it to go, and after we have tried our hardest to get out of it, to make it better.  This remains for me.  I am living it.  Today, for the first time I have started to make peace with it.  Suddenly more of the Bible makes sense.  

My peace I give to you.  Not as the world gives, but as I give it to you.  
Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.


So, I guess I am saying thank you for this year, God.  Thanks for showing me who you really are.  Thanks for helping me worship finally in spirit and in truth.  Thanks for your love.  Thanks for showing me how to love myself better.  Thanks for the gift of time.  

One of the last things my Grandpa Pooch said to me:  ""True growth is that which makes it impossible for us to go back to how things were."" 

That's where I am.  

God, please give me what you know I need.  Please don't give me what I think I want."

"event","My Grandpa Pooch passed away on Saturday, December 1, 2007.  We had rosary and funeral services for him on Wednesday and Thursday.  Then, on Thursday after the services there was a big community dinner at the Parish Hall in Ferdinand.  After that we all went to Grandma's house and talked and remembered a lot of stories.  So, here are some choice memories.

At the community dinner after the service, Amanda and I made it our goal to find out as many stories as possible.  My first target was my Grandma Ella's two younger brothers--Roy and Urban.  Urban was the ring bearer at Grandma and Grandpa's wedding.  He was 8 when they got married.  Grandma Ella's family had 9 kids, so there was quite an age gap.  I asked him to tell me a story about their wedding. ""Well,"" he started, ""It was the last wedding we had on the farm.""  He told me that Grandpa's best friend, Jerry Uhlorn, bit into a live chicken at the wedding and got a face full of feathers!  Amanda said, ""That must have been quite the party!"" and Uncle Urban just nodded.  I think my dad looks a lot like those two uncles of his.  Also, I met the girl who chased my grandpa down on the playground and planted his first kiss on him.  (I'm not supposed to tell Grandma about that one.) :) 

After the community dinner, we went to Grandma Ella's house.  Grandpa Pooch loved Tom and Jerry mix, so my cousins brought some of that over.  We also had some Keystone Light.  That particular beer brings back memories becuase it was always at Grandma's house.  Always!  At any rate, my dad and his siblings used to be pretty much party animals--it seems like.  There were some wild stories told about my dad.  For instance, when he was a senior in high school his parents went to Canada for a vacation.  They took all of his siblings along, but he didn't want to go.  While the whole family was in Canada he threw a huge party at the house.  It ended with some people streaking through Ferdinand on a motorcycle.  Also, the bar in Cottonwood--""The Twins""--was run by these two twins (hence the name).  They would let anyone in on Sundays.  The rest of the time you had to be 19 to get in.  Usually it was so packed they let anyone in, though.  My dad used to have to drive his sister's over to dances in Cottonwood.  He would drop them off at the dance and then head over to the Twins while he waited for them to get done.  One time Lynn and Tona came to the Twins to meet dad and get a ride home and saw his truck teetering on the top of a rock pile.  Some Duman guy had bet dad he couldn't get his truck to the top of the gravel pile.   He did.  Lynn and Tona saw the truck and said, ""Well, looks like we better find another ride home.""  

I think my sister's got even more memories than these--I'll have to check in with them and write more later.  But, suffice it to say there were some pretty funny memories floating around that house!  Oh wait--here's one more.  When I was just about 3 and Amanda was 1 we were living in a trailer out on the farm outside of Ferdinand.  One day mom heard something big walking around at night.  She told my dad there was something big walking around, but dad said it was just mice.  The next night mom took Amanda and I to bed with her and stuffed towels and stuff under the door to try to barricade the ""big thing"" outside the bedroom.  Dad was in the living room watching TV or something.  Next thing you know he comes into the bedroom and said, ""I saw it.  It's huge!""  It was a ginormous pack rat.  The next day dad figured out it was hanging around the washer and dryer, so he waited for it with a 22.  It didn't materialize until a long time after that, and it ran away.  Dad said that was the end of the pack rat.  Mom moved the washer and bleached everything.  The rat came back!  This time they heard it in the dryer, so they moved the dryer out to the porch.  Dad called grandpa Pooch and said, ""Bring the dog and get out here!""  So Grandpa Pooch brought the dog (to kill the rat) and came on out.  The dog wasn't interested in the rat after all, so my mom, dad, and Grandpa got some brooms and other similar weapons and waited for the rat to come out of the dryer.  Finally it did, and Granpa Pooch stomped the rat repeatedly until it was dead.  After that, I (my little three year old self) would go around telling people, ""Granpa Pooch stomped, stomped, stomped.""  He did.  That would've been so gross!  I don't actually remember the event; I just remember hearing stories about it."

"event","Our company did not end up coming out to White Salmon after all.  So tonight concludes a four day Thanksgiving weekend spent in the company of Josh and only Josh.  I think it was divine intervention.  It seems like this long holiday weekend together was just what the doctor ordered.  It was one the best holiday weekends ever.  Josh and I have never celebrated a holiday with just us.  It was very building, I think, for our relationship.  We are both vegetarian, so I made Tofu Pamigiana and all the traditional turkey trimmings.  One of the really fantastic parts about this Thanksgiving is that we had bought boat loads of food for Josh's family.  Those teen age boys can sure eat!  Since we are vegetarian and try to eat healthy, we had a lot of food around that we would never eat.  Josh asked around at school and found a family who was down on thier luck and was not going to celebrate Thanksgiving.  We were able to give them all teh food, including the turkey, that we wouldn't eat.  It was definitely divine intervention.  I feel so happy.  It gives me a lot of joy inside to share.  I also sent a pie because you all know from my previous baking post that we have a lot of uneaten baked goods in our freezer now. I am going to send them all to Iraq.  My brother is there right now.  I think baked goods may be just the thing for him.  Oh, on a side note I beat Josh in cribbage...finally.  I think I am getting better!"

My freezer currently has three kinds of cookies waiting for their debut at the Thanksgiving ""pre-meal"" show.  I just pulled a beautifully browned cheery pie out of the oven.  I even made the crust.  It delights me.  I also made a pumpkin cheesecake tonight.  That was LOML's request.  I asked him what he couldn't live without this Thanksgiving.  He said he absolutely needed a pumpkin pie in a graham cracker crust...I decided that cheesecake was as close as I could get.  I think I may still make cinnamon rolls for Thanksgiving morning.  I would also like to make pumpkin bread.  My friend gave me fresh pumpkin for baking....I'm dying to use it!  

I hope our company comes now.  Otherwise I guess I'll sign up for another coffee hour to get rid of some of the goodies.  We were expecting my in-laws (three teenage boys, two parents), but they called tonight to say that they would like us to come down there instead.  I already bought groceries, baked, and planned on staying here.  I'm not so good with changes at the last minute.  So, we'll see.  Actually, I think I would be just fine with staying here with Joshie.  We would have a blast and build our own family--him and I.  That would be great.  I dream about finding a homeless or poor family with whom to share our meal.  We'll see.  I am not worried, concerned or stressing.  How could I be?  I just spent a whole decadent evening baking.  Ahhhhh, heaven.  Should I get the chance, I would love to spend Thanksgiving day bake, bake, baking away.  Well, and some cooking, too."

"event","It's been a while since I've posted.  School has started, and it's been a rough re-entry this year for me.  I am exhausted--emotionally mostly.  Teaching is definitely a job that requires a lot of a person's emotional reserve.  It seems there are always those kids who need a little extra buoying up, a little extra push, and I always want to give them what they need.  I always get stressed about school, too, because I start to worry about doing a good job.  I'm not worried about losing my job, but I do worry that I won't be good enough for my own standards.  It's really draining to worry about that all the time.  I have so many dreams about what can be done in education and the kind of teacher I want to be.  I might not ever be that which I want to be.  It overwhelms me a lot of times.  

So, today, as I was with the Divine, I think I finally was able to begin to let go.  I thought about the Divine and her purpose for my life.  She knows far better than I the road my life will take.  I can trust her, and as Denise Levertov wrote, give myself over utterly to belief.  Belief in the divine and in the purposes and plans for my life.  BUt most importantly, I am able to let go of the need to perform for myself.  I will give teaching and children my best effort.  I will take risks, and I will self-reflect.  I will be kind to myself and give myself room to grow into the kind of teacher I want to be.  I will relax because I believe in the Divine.  It's ok for me to make mistakes.  I will not hold myself to an impossibly high standard.  As I do this, I already know I will become the teacher I am destined to become.  And, if I never grow one more ounce as a teacher, I will accept this.  I will let myself be.  I will value the things that are good about me.  I will value my talents.  

Finally, I will be lost in the love of the Divine.  My heart which is too often the dry cracking ground of desert will soak up the Divine and thrist for more.  I will believe that the most important part of my life is not school or my husband.  The most important part of my life is that the Divine loves me and has loved me before my birth into this world.  Nothing can take that.  No one can give that.  It just is and I love it.  I love being loved by the Divine.  I love the Divine in me, my hope of glory.  These circumstances don't matter.  Nothing else really matters.  This is the all, the everything.  This is my peace."

We sit watching; my bare leg rests against your naked foot.  There is no need to say anything.  I am composing a poem in my head while you silently breathe in and out.  I imagine that you are thinking of something sacred while I breathe in and breathe out.  This is our snapshot developed by time and catalyzed by the hard stuff.  Let's not think backward to how we are here or forward to where we might be just yet.  This is us now.

"event","In one of her books, Joan Chittister, a Benedictine sister, writes about the difference between spirituality and piety, and it is a distinction that I think needs to be made.  Piety, she writes, is the noticing is corporate greed, or violence and doing nothing.  Spirituality is the noticing of the greed or violence around it, feeling its effects, and then asking God what he would have each of us do to make a change.  Then, finally, to do what it is that God has asked.  I agree completely with Chittister on this front.  Simply being aware of the bad in the life that surrounds me, even feeling the effects of it, without asking God what he would have me do about it isn't where I want to be.  So, I have asked.  Right now I feel like the answer God has given me is to be the best teacher I can be.  I should learn all I can about education and then seek to change the system that is wrought with classism, racism, sexism, violence and indifference.  Mostly, I should love children and young adults with the love which Christ has loved me with.  Then, circularly, that love compels me to do something to educate children equally.  This brings me to the next point Chittister made.

Chittister remarks these spiritual rules are not being written by, ""...a spiritual taskmaster who will bully us or beat us down into a counterfeit claim to growing us up.""  How often is spirituality approached in just this way--a bully?  How often do I approach myself in teh same way--as if being harsh will grow me up?  Instead, the patience and love of Christ move me to want to grow and then to true growth.  This same works in my classroom.  No amount of my hardness, strictness or sarcasm will ever result in true growth for children and young adults.  Only my patience, love and care will ever bring them to a place of true growth.  (Note:  this is not to say that there are no rules or standards in my classroom.)  It is the only thing that will bring me to that same place.  

Chittister's final remark in this section is profound.  She states, ""We are being called to something outside ourselves, something greater than ourselves, something beyond ourselves.  We will need something to show us the way:  The Christ, a loving spiritual model."""

"event","LOML and I just got back from the annual back to school barbeque for the staff at the school I work at.  It was a blast!  What a comparison between last year and this.  Last year I was very nervous because I was new, and this year I was able to relax and chat with my very awesome coworkers and just have a ball.  And I did!  I actually surprised myself because I just was chatting it up with everyone.  I think this is the real me finally emerging.  Of course it helps that last year I started a social club and proclaimed myself the social chair.  I planned all sorts of get togethers starting in the early spring.  I was so tired of LOML's fellow staff members having all sorts of fun parties. My staff didn't have any, so I started having some.  It was great.  Tonight at the barbeque several people asked me if I was going to start up the social club again.  Of course! My pleasure.  This whole experience has reminded me of several things.

First of all, I am a fun person.  LOML told me the other day that it is really fun to live with me becuase I am always up for basically anything and I always have fun.  It really touched me becuase I never really considered myself a fun person to be around.  But, after thinking about it, I realized I always do like to have fun and will generally make anything fun.  Now, at different times in my life this fun-ness, as I like to call it, has been squelched by some different things--other people, my own insecurity, etc.  So, if you are reading this and you don't remember me being particularly fun you probably knew me during a squelch time.  Be warned:  the true Macie Schaeffer-Kingsley is loads of fun!

The second thing it reminded me of is that life is process.  The first school I taught at I ended up staying at for five years.  We had the same middle school staff for those years.  It was four of us core teachers.  LOML dubbed us the ""fab four"" and we were.  I loved those co-workers.  We worked very well together, joked around, and were a great team.  After I left there, I mourned and grieved for a while.  I missed them.  I missed the chemistry and comraderie.  It was a difficult transition to leave the ""fab four.""  Looking back I realize I did have some grief around missing my friends.  That is normal and natural.  A year later, I am walking past the missing and sadness and making new friends and loving my new co-workers. 

All in all I think we are out for a great year.  I am really ready to get the party started!  As the Black Eyed Peas are fond of singing, ""Let's get it started in here!""  :)"

"event","Deciding to get a haircut can be a tough decision. Mostly, I tend to let my hair just grow out until a style speaks to me using the Tao and I decide to get a cut.  My last haircut was one year ago.  We were new in White Salmon, and so I went to the only haircutting place in town.  I asked for a cut, and it turned out rather like a mullet.  I was embarassed for a long time about my mullet.  Mullets just aren't very cute, trendy, sexy...anything.  To remedy my mullet, I pretended I was from the South.  I loaded up on hairspray and formed big, teased hair for a couple of months until my hair was long enough to pull, sides included, up into a bun.  From that momentous day forward I wore my hair in a bun at all times.  I was waiting for the right hairstyle to speak to me from the pages of my glossy magazines.  

Lately, the Katie Holmes haircut has been calling to me from the pages of OK magazine.  It seemed right, so I decided to go for it.  I tore the picture of Katie, Tom and Suri out of my magazine and headed for a new haircut shop I just noticed down in Bingen.  You should know that Bingen, a town connected to White Salmon, has many Hispanic owned shops.  This haircut place was one of them.  I did have some worries--would they speak English?  Would the hairstylist be familiar enough with my white girl hair?  The adventure called to me.  Katie Holmes called to me.  I had to do it.  

The inside of ""Family Hair Salon"" matched its name.  The waiting area was full of older gentlemen shooting the breeze and young children playing.  A woman called ""Hola"" to me as I walked in.  I replied ""Hi!"" back, and so she switched to English to ask what I needed.  I asked for an appointment, and a man who sat gently swirling in the unoccupied barbar chair said in a heavy accent, ""I have time, if you want me to do it.""  I couldn't resist the offer.  I showed him the picture of Katie and said, ""This is how I want it.""
""Are you sure?  That's really short.""  he questioned.
""I am sure.  I've thought about this for quite a while,"" I answered him back.  Little did he know I had been waiting for this to emerge from the Tao for a whole year now.  
""Look,"" he pointed back to Katie, ""It's really short right here.  See?""  
I looked at Katie and nodded enthusiastically.  ""Yes.  That's what I want.""  
He finally agreed.  ""Ok.  He said.  I will do it.""  
And so it began--my first haircut at a Hispanic owned salon and my first haircut from a man.  He took me back to the shampoo chair and lathered up his hands with shampoo.  I could hear his rough hands rubbing the shampoo together.  I could hear the full round sounds of Spanish fill up the empty spaces between us.  ""Hot, cold, or medium?"" He asked me as he began to wash my white girl hair.  Back at the haircut chair he started the cutting process and I mostly sat in silence and listened to the conversations I couldn't understand around me.  Finally his deep accented English voice broke my internal silence.  ""Do you speak Spanish?""  
""One phrase,"" I told him, ""La Houra de Comere"" (It's time to eat.)  A big laugh rose up from his belly.  ""That's a good one!""  He answered.  The rest of the time was spent listening to the voices around me and the snip of the scissors.  He handed me a mirror and spun me around when I was finished.  ""You like?"" He asked.   I nodded my approval.  It was considerably longer than Katie's.  But it was cute and decidedly un-mullet like.  That made it great in my book.
""Do you want your hair?"" he pointed at my cut hair on the floor as I wrote out my check.  We both laughed as I said ""No thanks!""  I noticed the older men behind me were laughing as well.  Our mingled laughter followed me out the door, sat with me in my car, and rings in my ears as I write this now.  How often do you get lingering laughter with the price of your haircut?"

"event","I just returned home from a visit to North Carolina.  My sister, her husband and her two little ones live there.  I had such a great time spending time with them; the only problem is that now I miss them and I wish they lived with me here or I lived with them there in NC.  Life marches on, however.  I live here in Washington with my husband.  My sister lives in NC, but she will probably be moving soon. I can't exactly bank on her staying in NC forever.  Her husband is a Marine, so he could get restationed and likely will soon.

I had a wonderful time with my two newphews.  I love spending time with them--it makes my heart very happy.  I love my sister, too.  I wish life didn't have to be painful, like we could all just be together all the time.  But, we can't.  So in the meantime I will have to stay as close as I can from a distance without sacrificing what I need to do too.  I need to be a teacher and a wifey as well as a sister and an auntie.  

Are there any suggestions out there about staying close over the miles, about balancing extended family of origin with your own spouse?  I am open to any suggestions.  Life seems to be a puzzle to me lately.

At any rate, my sister and I had a lot of fun, so here's my list for my own rememberance.  I write this in remembrance of my time in NC:
1.  We went to an aquarium where we saw the ""zoo keepers"" feed the sharks.  It was fascinating, and Samuel really loved it a lot.  We also went on the nature trail where Samuel tried to read every sign.  Amanda and I talked about how ready he is to read and how his world will change when he is reading.  We also saw an egret and a snake.  Harrison selpt through most of this.  Also, I took Samuel's picture in a crab.  
2.  We went to the beach twice. Time one was very windy.  Harrison cried when the sand blew into his legs.  It was so windy, we all got sand in our picnic.  It put the true meaning of sand in sandwhich.  :) The second time we went it was less windy, so we got to stay all afternoon.  Harrison and Samuel and I loved the water.  Harrison was fearless--it was scary!  He loved the ocean and you had to watch him like a hawk.  Otherwise he'd just go all teh way out in it.  He also loved to swing.  I pushed him and he was laughing and loving it so much.  He wanted to go higher and higher.  Samuel made friends with some other kids there, and they dug up his dinosaur bones together.
3.  Amanda and I watched A LOT (the exact amount will remain nameless to protect us) of episodes of ""What not to wear"" on TLC.  Then we took the boys to Target and tried on tons of outfits and had our own episode.  Super fun!  The boys were really good because Amanda took golashes for them to try on.  They really liked them.
4.  We went to Chic Fil A for lunch.  It was good.  
5.  We went to Cold Stone twice. Admittedly it's not a particularly southern franchise, but I had never been.  THe boys love their ice cream
6. I made up stories for Samuel about Luke and Lea (of Star Wars fame) when they were four.  He loved them.
7.  I read The Cat in the Hat about 100 times.
8.  I played ""Where'd Harrison Go?"" a lot.  It makes Harrison laugh.
9.  I jumped on the trampoline.
10.  We made S'Mores with the S'More making kit.  Harrison was sticky--so cute!
11.  We walked to the gas station on Sunday for teh Schaeffer candy on Sunday tradition.  THe guy there was named ""Bobbye"" and talked with a deep Southern accent.  It made me laugh when he said, ""Thanks, sweetie"" after I paid.
12.  We talked about how fun JoAnna's wedding was.
13.  We had iced coffee from Starbucks.
14.  We had Ocean Water from Sonic.
15.  We made cookies with the boys.  The next morning Auntie Macie let Harrison have three for breakfast.  This is one of the priveleges of being an auntie and not a mommie.  :)
15.  Aunite Macie left the PNB jar open where Harrison could get it.  He reached in and grabbed a handful of PNB.  Cute mess!

There's more, but I suppose that's it for now.  That was really great for me to write some of the memories down.  I will have to go back more often.  It was so fun and I really love that family."

"event","My middle sister got married on Sunday.  There are five of us children, and she was the third to get married. (Josh has three unmarried brothers, so our wedding adventures are really just beginning!)  It was gorgeous, mostly because the bride was resplendent and the groom was obviously giddly with love for my sister.  She found a great man to marry, and I am excited and happy for both of them.  Blessings to them as they begin thier new journey with thier new family.  The groom has a son, so they are already a family of three.

I had the pleasure of being a bridesmaid in her wedding.  My two sisters and I were bridesmaids, along with a friend of the bride.  I had so much fun!  It was a blast, and I really realized some things about my self and my relationship with my family that was so freeing and amazing to me.  First, I realized that I am in some small ways and in some significant ways different from my sisters.  And (drum roll please!) I decided that I was ok with that.  I am ok with my place in the family, and I don't need my sisters to ""do"" anything to make me feel accepted.  I am accepted to the point that I am accepted, and that is ok.  Really and truly!  Somehow this realization released more real love in me for my sisters and my brother and brothers-in-law.  Also, I think because I have been doing this spiritual work of finding myself and accepting myself in the divine, I had a great time.   I was myself, and I loved it.  I gave what I had to give, and didn't go beyond what I had to give in order to be kind to myself, too.  At this point I am having trouble explaining this.  Quite simply, I love myself more.  I am more aware of the love the divine has for me.  This has caused me to love my family more genuinely.  It's a good feeling.  I think I will be ok afterall!

Joshie agreed with me, too.  What we didn't know then was that inside our cute little gray and white kitten was a great hunter with the heart of a lion, the quickness of a panther, and the strength of a gorilla.  

I got home from a week away last Saturday night and discovered a ""present"" left for me by the great hunter king.  It was a dead bat.  Yep, you read it right.  I did say a bat.  Jefferson had a way in and out of the house, and somehow he had killed a bat and brought it to me.  The rational side of my brain said, ""It's a bat.  Bats are great: they kill bugs, they won't hurt you..."" But the culturally conditioned, slightly irrational side of my brain said, ""Oh my gosh!  It will bite me and I will turn into a vampire or get rabies or something!""  It was dead, and I had that in my favor.  So, I tipped a garbage can upside down over the dead bat and worked on pushing down my fear so I could dispose of it.  The next morning, full of unnatural courage,  I swept it into the garbage can and threw it away in the outside cans.  

Early this morning, I was awakened from sleep by a schreeching, high pitched sound.  In my half awake mind, I thought, ""It's some dumb bug.  Jefferson will take care of it.""  I promptly konked back out.  Some time later, I was awakened by Joshie jumping up to turn on the light.  ""It's a bat!"" He said to me.  I bolted up in bed and said, ""Where are my glasses?  I have to see!""  I had visions of the bat flying into my face and me not even being able to see it.  Scary!  Josh found my glasses for me, and sure enough there writhing and screeching on the floor was a velvet winged bat.  Jefferson was crouched and watching, ready to spring like a panther.  

Joshie and I looked at the moving black heap on the floor and at each other.  What would we do with a half dead bat, a panther, and cultural conditioning?  Josh got the same garbage can I used out of the bathroom and put it over the bat.  I coaxed the panther outside.  This way we could deal with our cultural conditioning without interference.  We stood, thinking of ways to dispose of the bat for a half hour.  We kicked around ideas from ""Let's just leave it under there until it is really dead.  Then we can get rid of it."" (macie) to, ""Let's slide the garbage can all the way to the front door then we can kick it out."" (joshie).  In the end, Joshie used a broom to put the bat into the garbage can.  Because the bat was still alive, it clung to the broom.  Josh took broom and all out to our deck.  Once outside, the night colored bat contrasted sharply with the stabbing morning sun.  It hopped, blinded now by the daylight, trailing his one broken wing to the edge of our second story deck and hopped off, falling into the bushes below.  

It was only there, on the already too hot deck, that my cultural conditioning started to evaporate.  It was only then, seeing the shaken and shrieking bat limp for the side of the deck that the rational thoughts from my brain were able to finally take hold.  Josh's words echoed my own thoughts as he said, ""I hope he can find a safe place to heal.""  I do, too.  And I hope next time I am able to suspend my conditioning for long enough to care for creatures that may be lost, alone, afraid, and out of thier element."

"event","LOML has returned!  It has been so good to be with him again.  It's like I can relax again for the first time all summer.  We made it, and I am breathing a sigh of relief!  He got in on Sunday night.  I picked him up at the airport around 10.  We stayed in Portland and lived it up ala John Legend on Monday.  We went out to lunch (I had saved a gift card for over a year--go Macie!) and to a movie.  We walked around downtown Portland.  We both love that activity!  LOML brought me back a Cubs visor (they're in #1 spot right now--go Cubbies!) and a prayer/head scarf in the Muslim tradition.  It's very beautiful and I love it.  Anyway, I digress ala T.S. Eliot.  We saw the Simpsons movie.  It was very funny.  LOML loves the Simpsons.  It was good.  I tried to get my Shuffle fixed, but Apple gave me the run around again.  

Then, Tuesday and Wednesday we just hung around the WS.  We did a whole lot of nothing.  We went to the beach, played Yahtzee, took naps, prayed services...it was a great couple of days.  The best part was just being with Joshie again.  I just like to be with him.  The crazy thing is that this summer I am going to see him for these four days, then for a week and a half after this weekend.  Then I am off to North Carolina and he starts school when I get back from NC.  It has been a crazy summer!  Definitely one that has made me vow, ""The limit of us being apart is four weeks.  I cannot take any more than that!""  Then the woman's lib part of me thinks,"" What are you thinking, girl?  You can't live without him for that long?  You have to have your own life!""  But I really don't think that is true.  God put us together, melded our hearts, and even though I am my own person, I want to be with Josh.  That is just how it is.  All in all, I think that is a good sign for our marriage.  So, next summer if Josh hits up Chi town, I am going to be there with him.  No questions asked!"

"event","<p>You might have read about good ol red, running out of gas, and the difficulties that entails in my earlier posts.&nbsp; However, the plot defninitely thickened here of late.&nbsp; After my car refused to start on last Thrusday, I called a mecanic.&nbsp; He told me to try to put lots of gas in it and see if it would start.&nbsp; So I hauled my self down to the gas station and brought back five gallons of gas.&nbsp; I put it in the car and called my friend from Hood River who works over here in WS to see if he could give me a jump.&nbsp; He agreed, and the car started!&nbsp; I promptly decided to drive it around town for about an hour to charge up the battery.&nbsp; All went well for about 45 minutes.&nbsp; Then the car decided to die!&nbsp; Long story short, after I called the tow truck I gave it one more try and it started, so I promptly went home and parked the car.<br /><br />But, I was supposed to be in Vancouver Monday-Friday for a conference, and now I didn't trust my car.&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't get it into the mechanic until Tuesday, so I needed a car for Monday and Tuesday.&nbsp; I humbled myself and asked my HR friend if I could borrow his car for two days until I could get mine fixed.&nbsp; He agreed.&nbsp; So, on Monday morning I drove to Vancouver.&nbsp; It was then that I found out that my conference was in Tacoma.&nbsp; Ouch!&nbsp; I was already late, and Tacoma is about 2 1/2 hours from Vancouver.&nbsp; It's like Seattle to Portland.&nbsp; I called my HR friend and he said to go ahead and drive to Tacoma (what a friend, huh!).&nbsp; Then, I called my husband's good friend in Seatlle and asked if I could crash at his house for the week.&nbsp; He agreed, and actually offered his girlfriend's house which I accepted.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Needless to say, I am kina glad it all worked out how it did.&nbsp; It was stressful, but I got to hang in Seatlle/Tacoma all week with two great friends.&nbsp; We had such a good time.&nbsp; We went to a Mariner's game (Andy Samberg of SNL fame was there!) and we went for a Falafel in the Capitol Hill area.&nbsp; Good times, good times.&nbsp; I really, really had fun.<br />&nbsp;<br />So now I am home, and the best mechanic in the world yesterday fit me in so I could get a new fuel filter on my car.&nbsp; I just took a completely home made blueberry pie out of the oven for the HR friend whose car I borrowed.&nbsp; At around 6 I am on my way to hang out with friends, go camping with family, and attend my sister's bridal shower tomorrow.&nbsp; Life is certainly an adventure.&nbsp;<br /><br />My only question is this:&nbsp; Who gets entire cities confused?&nbsp; Like, how many people mix up Vancouver and Seatlle?&nbsp; I think it might only be me.&nbsp; I feel really spacey sometimes!</p>"

"event","I woke up this morning with a sense of excitement and anticipation...today was my first day without any teaching!&nbsp; I had gone right from the regular school year into summer school, and it has been very emotionally draining.&nbsp; I always tell myself that I won't&nbsp; teach summer school next year, but then I always do.&nbsp; Maybe next summer I won't teach summer school.&nbsp; Maybe?&nbsp;&nbsp;

The day dawned.&nbsp; As I got out of bed it was already hot, and I knew today was going to be a cooker.&nbsp; I had a date to meet a friend downtown, so I got ready and drove my 2000 Cavalier down to meet my friend.&nbsp; I remembered that it needed gas, but I was running late and opted not to get any.&nbsp; After all, I had reset the trip odometer when my gas light came on.&nbsp; I had only logged 8 miles since then, and usually I can get 20-30 after the gas light shines truth to me from the dashboard.&nbsp; After lunch with my friend, I ran home to get my computer and head to get gas and go to the library to study for a bit.&nbsp; After that I had the best part of my week--contemplative prayer group with two good friends.&nbsp; I went down the stairs and started my car.&nbsp; It started, and I got settled in.&nbsp; Then it stopped.&nbsp; I couldn't get it started, and I realized that I had run the tank dry.&nbsp; Oh crap!&nbsp; This is just what I didn't need today!&nbsp; I wanted to go to prayer!&nbsp; So, I decided to hoof it down to the gas station to get some gas.&nbsp; The gas station is about a mile away.&nbsp; When I got back, drenched in gas and sweat stink, I put the gas in the car and tried to start her up again.&nbsp; No dice.&nbsp; I called my dad to find out what to do, and he suggested the injectors might need some time to get the fuel back in them.&nbsp; So, in giving the car time, the weak battery gave out.&nbsp; Now I was faced with a dead batter and gas that can't get to the engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This was a particularly ironic situation because I am alone this summer while LOML is away studying in Chi-town.&nbsp; This is exactly what I didn't want to have happen!&nbsp; Before LOML left for Chicago, we had the car tuned up because I didn't want to be alone with car trouble&nbsp; Now, what I fear has again come upon me.&nbsp; I am alone and stranded.&nbsp; What to do now?&nbsp; Who do I turn to?&nbsp; 

One quirky thing about my personality or something is that I have trouble calling people and asking for help.&nbsp; I am really afraid of rejection and being a trouble to people.&nbsp;This timeI had no choice.&nbsp;&nbsp; LOML couldn't do this for me from Chicago.&nbsp; I gathered up all my courage and called everyone on the church directory who lived in the WS &nbsp;for help.&nbsp; No one answered.&nbsp; So I called again.&nbsp; Still no answer.&nbsp; So, I called for the third round.&nbsp; This time I left messages.&nbsp; Later this evening a kind family from church called me back and came and helped me jump my car.&nbsp; It still wouldn't start.&nbsp; They, however, offered to loan me a car to get to work tomorrow.&nbsp; I was blown away by thier care, concern, and generosity.

Even though I missed my formal prayer group, I experienced the presence of the divine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly have more community today than I had yesterday.&nbsp; I've made two more friends.&nbsp; Isn't that what happens when the divine is present--community, love, and friendship?&nbsp;Does the divine speak via the&nbsp;gas light in an old Chevy Cavalier?&nbsp; I think this time she did.&nbsp;"

"event","Well here I am, sitting in a cubicle, bored to tears. Somehow or another, I managed to get myself sucked into helping the Orlando family yet again. Although, for everything they have done for me, I pretty much owe them my first born child. 

These past two months have been ever so different from school. Started going to the gym, lost some weight, started tanning, and I really thought that this summer I was going to start to worry more about myself and less about others. Then a month ago Sarah and Jendy got an apartment in Upton... downfall of erikas 'great plans'

This month has been an absolute and complete emotional rollercoaster, but I can finally say, that it's been the kind where you get excited for the next stomach turning drop. I'm so sick of falling so hard so fast. With this new relationship in bird's eye view, I feel like I NEED to be a mature adult. I've just never experienced anyone being so content with talking to me, and wanting to see me all the time.Basically, I've never started out as friends with a boy that I have fallen for, which ends in acomplete catastrophe to my emotional status. I normally meet a boy, bond for one night, hook up, then I get attached, and he sees it as an easy booty call. Smart girls,myself included, although I am blinded soooo easily, can see right through this facade. Me on the other hand, is so desperate for that emotional connection, with someone, with anyone, that I am somehow able to justify their fucked up actions b/c I have done something wrong. Well, I think it's about time Erika grew up. 

This boy in my life will be a good good friend of mine. It is time for me to stop desperatly reaching for someone to make me feel like I am worth something. Although I deff. still do have some pretty strong feelings for him, I need to differentiate when it is ok to act upon these feelings. And for once in my life, I honestly can say that this boy pretty much feels the same way. I don't want to sit and wait for him to say, ok Erika, my life is ok now, I'm ready for you to just drop everything and be with me.No way, fuck that.
 *I did that for 2 years, hell I moved half way across the country because I thought a boy was going to finally realize just how special I was, but 4 years later, it still hasnt happened. Yet he still has this fucked up way of making me feel like he's in love with me. Whatever, different chapter in my book. *

I will continue to love this boy to death b/c he means so much to me, but I will not sacrifice something that could come my way because I am playing the waiting game. For once, I TALKED out my feelings with him instead of being the crazy scorpio I am and botteling it all up until it just explodes. It was honestly probably one of the most mature, reasonable conversations I have ever had about my emotions. I do hope in the future, things between us will progress, but honestly, right now, I'm happy being friends until we are both ready to take it a step further. 

Bah. ok that was for sure a rant, but sometimes I need to write things for myself to get them organized in my own head.Ok back to STILL LIFE WITH WOODPECKER. Tom Robbins is the only man that can make these next 2 hours go by smoothly."

"event","Got a job:-) Yet again I will be spending mucho time in a greenhouse which is amazing. If I weren't into the whole English thing, then I think plant and soil sciences would be my bag baby.

I don't know what I was thinking this weekend. For some reason someone was on my mind, maybe it's because I'm lonely and thought miraculously that he would be lonely too. Unbeknownst to me, there was already someone there visiting. God I feel like such an idiot. I know I fucked it up many years ago, but I just feel like we both have finally found ourselves more. I treated him like such an asshole, and niave me thinks it's ok to just pretend like nothing ever happened. It's a vicious cycle. I'm an incredibly jealous person, and I hate feeling like that. There are just such overwhelming feelings that come up when I think of him, the first boy that made me feel like I was worth anything ever, and I just talked to him all the time about how much I liked someone else...now...4 years later, I can't get him out of my head. I need some reassurance in my life. I just always thought I could come back to him, like no matter what was going on in my life, that he was always going to be there, even as a friend. I know I fucked it up long ago. It's a bit ironic, don't you think?

I am trying so hard to be good and get my life in order. I am not smoking as much pot as I normally would be. It's time to stop numbing myself from reality and start really dealing with my problems. I love the culture that comes with it, I love the people, but it is something that compeltely shuts you off from reality...or can open you up to a completely different reality. I just feel like I have let myself slip off the face of the earth for years, and it's time to start really facing raw emotions. 

I talked to my Mom today for the first time in an eternity. I hate that her problems still determine my emotional status. She has this sly way of making everyone feel so sorry for her, and I hate it. I love her because she is my Mom, but I can see through her like no one else can. No one else was there for her rediculous downfall, not even Stephen. He was locked in his room, and has been now for years. Mind you I wasn't exactly helping, but I was 14 with a book full of problems myself. Sometimes I wonder why I even still think about it, I havent lived with her in 4 years, but it's still such a huge factor in how I feel everyday. I feel completely akward talking to my own parents, doesn't exactly help myself out in my confidence situations. ehh i don't know why I am even writing in this right now, I should be reading the 100 books that I have to read. I'm just having one of those spiritual, collapsing, blossoming, beautiful but so ugly days. 

i'm looking for someone to change me...."

"event","It's been a rediculous weekend..

Thursday night- went to see Badfish at the Tammany with Candy and Gin. I obviously was the leper with the X's on my hands...but oh no...didn't stop me from getting wasted somehow. Jon Jon, Ottball, and Chew all showed up which was an amazing surprise. It was just like old times, before relationships erased friendships...on the ride home, we were belting out some old school Queen, and I all of a sudden ran over a damn HUGE rock and managed to somehow almost completely bent my rim in half. 4 in the morning, 3 girls stranded on the side of the road, wasted, raining, with no jack. Amazing...thank God for Razza coming and saving the night...

Friday- Doctor Professor and The Breakfast at the Middle East in Boston. Wicked good show, saw all the band which was exciting. Decided I shouldn't go home with the rest of the kids I came with, and went to Lowell to stay at Dr. P's casa. Good times, but I wasn't wasted, and everyone else was...kind of a strange experience. Bonded with Brandon more than I ever have before which was awesome.I just love those boys Went to sleep at 5, woke up at about 850 to Gabes damn alarm...cracked out for the rest of the day obviously..

Saturday- Adam called me. Honestly, thought this little fling was over, erased his number out of my phone..I was ready to just move on. I didn't want to do what I always do, and hold onto something that isnt there. But for some reason, he's been iming me lately, and asked me to call him...I then proceeded to tell him that I didn't have his number anymore...which I think was a bit of a kick in the ass for him. I went to Fitchburg to hang out for awhile, and he just kept apologizing, saying how stupid he felt for not calling. It's amazing that the second you seem unreachable to a guy, they all of a sudden dig you. I like him, I like being around him, I feel really comfortable when I'm with him,it's just so hard to meet someone that lives far away..it takes a lot of work and effort to hang out. I'm just going to go with the flow on this one...

Can't sleep. Too many things on my mind...Excited for school, but acting obvlivious to the fact that I actually have to go to classes and such..."

"event","So this is the first time I've ever written in this craziness. I always told myself I would never sucumb to the allure of these trendy online ""communities"",yet here I am, writing in one. I think it will be a nice outlet for me, since it's way easier then doing the whole old school pencil/notebook shit. It's been an interesting vacation so far. I needed to just forget about all of the shit that happened at school and let loose for these 6 weeks. I've managed to see just about everyone, met some cool new kids, and partied it up with those that mean the most to me. I'm heading up to Amherst tomorrow to find a job. It is imperative that I actually make next semester about responsibility, so me and Benson are bombing up early to apply at every restaurant that the eye can see. With a part time job, 5 classes, and a weekend 3-credit course, I will have no time to be up to no good. Hopefully we can just all leave last semester behind us and open up a new chapter..."

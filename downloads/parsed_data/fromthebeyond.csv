"event","I remember when I first saw Isabel, we weren't in High School yet. We were in the sixth grade and that's when I noticed her. She was beautiful even then. People talked about her, okay guys talked about her. People wanting to just sleep with her, just to use her or win a bet. Talked about various body parts. For me though it was always two things of hers that got my attention.

Her eyes. They always showed so much more then the outside showed. So much wisdom were mirrored in her eyes, and I could see it. Most thought she was an airhead, but i knew the truth. I could tell she had an old soul as it were. I always knew there was more to Isabel then she let others see. That she closed herself off.

The other thing?

Her smile. It lit up the room whether she knows it or not, it did and still does. What makes it better? She always had a smile on her face, though at times I could tell that it was plastered there and was fake. A real smile would reach her eyes, and light them up. The corners of her lips would be upturned. A fake smile her eyes were dull and lifeless, the corners were either straight or if really bad down turned. I like her real genuine smiles the best. She looks good happy.

Of course when you <i>are</i> the geek looking at <s>checking out</s> the pretty girl, the jocks that want a piece of her turn into animals. They will also throw you head first into a trash can and warn you to never look at their girl again, even if she wasn't theirs. Never stopped me.

I remember though that was the day I fell for Isabel, just got stronger over the years. Now that I have her back, I don't want to lose her again.

<s>I'm thinking marriage here.</s>

I do know one thing, I don't plan to waste my second chance at life. I plan to make the most of it. I want to be there for Maria and Liz. For Michael. I really want to be there for Isabel. I fully intend on making sure she knows just how much I love her, even if she doesn't feel the same any longer. She deserves to know that to at least me, she's the most incredible woman I have ever met. She's more human then a lot of humans with her caring spirit. My second chance at life I want to make count, make it worth something.

Second chances? Yes I believe in them, and I don't think a single moment should be wasted if you are given one. Make it count. Don't waste it. Don't throw it away. If you get a second chance, live it and use it to it's fullest, because if given one you are the luckiest person in the world.

"event","<small>Not really I mean I'm usually 'that geeky kid' or 'the nerd' so friends are hard to come by. I did have some friends and they were the best ones you could ever hope for. They didn't care how I looked, or how I dressed. They liked the fact my IQ was bigger then my shoe size. Liz Parker and Maria DeLuca. Yes I had girlfriends err well friends who are girls, only had one <i>girlfriend</i> but yeah later. Those two were or are my best friends, always there when I needed them. We could talk about anything from foods, movies, to science and philosophy. They were like my sisters though people always asked me why I didn't try anything. I mean come on I say they are like my sisters and ask that, it'd be like incest.

Of course through those two I made other friends, Max Evans, Isabel Evans, Michael Guerin, and Kyle Valenti. Even more friends who were there but then our group were more like a family. We all looked out for each other, watching the backs of everyone else while they had yours. That's what it was all about, what true friendship is.

[locked to above mentioned people]
Though what we had to go through in watching each others backs was a lot different then what normal people go through. Though I think in the end that made us the more stronger. We knew the risks of losing one another and we did everything we could to keep everyone safe. I also want you all to know I have no ill feelings about my death. If any of you are feeling some iota of guilt over it, there is no need. None of it was your fault and you should rest assured that I still respect and love each of you the same as I always have. There was nothing you could have done to stop it.
[unlocked]


I suppose in some ways I could say yes and no on whether I make friends easily. I have the ability to do so if you can see past the stereotypes of society, but it is also because of aforementioned stereotypes that it's hard for me to make friends.

<small>I dreamed of becoming a doctor when I was a little boy and of winning the Nobel Peace prize. I would go to sleep at night and it would all play out in my head, I had even written a practice speech for it because my dream seemed so real. Though my dreams tend to do that though the dream that stays with me the most was one I didn't have as a child but as a teenager. The most vivid dream I have ever had or series of dreams. They always involved me and Isabel Evans, one of the most beautiful girls in the school but it was so much more then that with her. She was funny and she was intelligent, a rare flower amongst weeds as some would say or a diamond in the rough as yet even others would say.

It was a nice fancy dinner this one dream was, I was dressed in a nice black tuxedo, then Isabel came into the dream. My dream self couldn't speak for a moment she was so beautiful, her hair all set up in curls. Those waves of spun golden framing her face perfectly, and the dress she wore, stunning red just made her look perfect. We danced and I held her in my arms telling her how beautiful she was, in my dreams those were our moments. Ones I never thought could be had in the real world so I settled for my dreams.</small>

If you could change one thing in history, what would it be and why?

<small>I'd go back and maybe change it so I didn't have to die and leave those I cared about behind. Those who let me in and felt more like a family to me then my own true family. Always there for each other to back the other up. Liz and Maria they were like my sisters, I had known them for so long and I'd do anything to protect them. Kyle, Max and Michael were my brothers, Max the compassionate caring one, and Michael the brash enforcer that would protect his own no matter what. He didn't need to show emotion for you to know he was there for you. Kyle the one that could always make me smile no matter how stressed things could be he was always trying to keep spirits up some.

Then there was Isabel who was so much more to me then I had ever thought possible, she was the woman I loved more then anything. The woman I would have given my life to protect on a deeper level then those of my friends. I know everyone understood and knew, that in the end if two were in trouble and I could only save one some ounce of chivalry would have me rushing to say my lady fair.

We even had our father, Sheriff Valenti who risked so much, gave up so much to keep us safe. To protect us all as best as he could with no concern to himself. He was selfless and cared unconditionally like a father should.

I watched over them all, but now I am here once more unsure whether best to approach or not.</small>

"event","<i>'What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.' Do you agree or disagree? Why?</i>

The pain you can feel at the loss of another can eat you up inside, I've seen this happen in the case of my death. I watched how everyone felt as if part of them was ripped away. Though the hardest to watch was Isabel, that hurt me on so many levels. I had loved her, still love her, to see her feel so broken because of me in the small way it was. Made me ache inside and I prayed for them to all be able to get through it.

Then I watched them get through the pain, overcome the pieces within they had thought dead. I watched them go on with their lives, picking up the pieces. I wished I could be part of their lives again, to laugh with them. To be able to protect them, and to be part of something once more. I could only watch, then when Isabel met Jesse, I saw she could be happy with someone again. I also saw her hesitation and her memories of what we had. I did the most painful thing I had to do, I helped convince her to move on. To be happy with Jesse, marry him then maybe she could have the life I had dreamed of giving her.

Then I was there watching the day she married him, I saw the smile on her face and it gave me a strength to know that maybe, just maybe she'd be alright. Then I watched as she left him behind, as their world crumbled and I couldn't do anything to help them.


I watched them die inside with my death, then I saw them all take that pain and turn it into strength and conviction to go on. So I can agree with the saying 'that which does not kill us, makes us stronger' because Max, Liz, Maria, Michael, and Isabel showed me the truth in those words. Now I am here, the how and why I've stopped asking. Maybe it's my second chance to feel I belong somewhere.

That drives me crazy, walking down the street minding my own business and i get stopped and asked if I've lived here all my life. Yes I have.

See what people don't get is they watch way too many movies. I'm sure some do kidnap humans but they'd have a reason to do something like that. But not all aliens are like that. I know because that just wasn't Max, or Michael, or Isabel. Tess was a bit off but in the end even I couldn't blame her. Sometimes it's not the person or in this case alien hybrid, but it's how you were raised. Liz, Maria, and I we've been close to them and I can honestly say stereotypes suck. If these people only knew, we could see Hollywood losing a lot of money on this. Because the general public just gets that view of it. The evil invaders of Earth here to take over the world. That's just a big pet peeve, never liked alien movies before but after knowing the aliens I know. I feel sorry for them they have to deal with that, no wonder they so freaked out about people finding out. I would be too.

Dreams can haunt, dreams can tease, can give you hope. I used to have these dreams of me and Isabel, where she wanted to be with me. We'd be having dinner and I was dressed up in a tux and Isabel, she just looked amazing. So breath taking, beautiful, intoxicating in an incredible looking red satin dress. She looked like a goddess, with her hair all down and hanging over her shoulders.


We'd dance, my arm around her waist holding her close against me as we moved with the music. So close to me I could smell her perfume, she was so enchanting. It all felt so real like maybe I stood a chance beyond the dream world.


I always hated waking up, having the dream end. Because when I was awake I knew it wasn't possible. That Isabel Evans deserved someone better then me. She was meant for greater. She was such an amazing person and I know to her I had to have been invisible.

Alex Whitman learned to not be so close minded. To be open to the possibility of anything and everything. He used to think if it couldn't be proved with the wonders of science, it just didn't exist. That is until he met Max, Michael, Isabel, and Tess. Alex would have laughed at anyone that had said that aliens existed, but those four proved him wrong. They showed Alex a faith in science could be faulty, and that anything was possible.


They opened Alex's eyes to a whole new world where truly anything could be real. Though there was one thing that totally through him off about that whole thing. Alex had the biggest crush on Isabel, finding out the girl you liked was from another planet well its a bit surreal. At first hethought it'd change how he felt, but it didn't. In that he learned something else, that no matter what you learn about someone, they are still the same person you know. 



Alex is grateful to those four, and to Maria and Liz, for letting him in. For showing him that anything and everything was possible. For teaching him to view the world with eyes wide open along with his mind open and ready for the possibility of so much more being out there.

Not anymore and she deserved to have someone that loved her that could hold her close at night. That could whisper they loved her in her ear.

"event","-Lets go back about Week to About Wednesday(21MAR). *freaky music* \

So I decide that I'm going to go to Windsor to see Edward. I have just E-mailed his roommate and asked her what the address was cause I wasn't sure. SO! Got that, then, I asked Edward (nonchalantly) what time his train is leaving. 
""9:55am and it will get into Oakville at 1:30"" 
""Perfect"", I think. 
So I book my ticket moments later. A Student one-way from Toronto to Windsor and a One way from Windsor to Oakville.  
""He has No Idea"", I thinks

<b>*beams to Thursday(29MAR) (Freaky music)*</b>
____________________________________

I wake up and I'm in a great mood.""Ed has no Idea""
I go downstairs and go on the computer. ""Good morning!"" I type.
""Good morning, how was your sleep"" He asks, as always
""Oh it was fine"" I answer, as always (just because I find sleeping a waste of time)
So this conversation continues for quite some time. Ed has to start to get ready to go to school. I tell him that Me and Danielle are going to go tanning this morning so i'll have to leave about the same time as him. But really I'm starting my day to Go down to Toronto and eventually Windsor. I sign off really quickly because I was originally was going to go later in the day but then decided that I would go now because I had nothing to do today. So I quickly get ready and catch the 9:30 Bus Downtown. While I was waiting at the Bus stop I ran into someone I knew who just finnish college taking architecture and was happy to hear that she was happy that she was now finnished.... 

So I go to the bank and then over to the Greyhound station. 
(I'm listening to a little music just enjoying my day)
Get on the Greyhound around 1020am and then on our way we go. 
I end up in Toronto no problems to speak of. 
The train Leaves at 400pm and it's noon now. I couldn't figure out what I was going to do. So I text my friend Joel and was like ""Hey what are you up to"" waited for a response... didn't get one... Oh well. I went took a walk by the Lake, Went to the Sobeys down on the Queens Quay (If any of you haven't been there I swear it's the cutest little Sobeys I have ever been in, I go in there often) And I get some 7 Grain Salad for lunch. I decide that I will walk for a little while longer and then it's about 200pm. SO I start to make my way back to the station. on my way I pick up a flower, A red one, it was very pretty and reminds me of Spring... (And Telus...) I go to Union and wait in line for the Via. I'm starting to feel very excited casue I have never been on Viarail before. I board the train and then find a nice window seat. A few minutes later a girl says 
""Can I sit next to you?""
""Oh for sure"" I say with a smile
then the train starts going. 
""Grafitti is always cool too look at when it's done in a non-gang style"" she says
I was a bit startled about the comment because I wasn't expecting it
""Yeah, I know what you mean"" I say
""Where are you off too?"" The girl says
""Windsor. How about you?"" I say
""Oh your in for the long haul"" She says with a grin ""I'm getting off in Chatham""
""Oh really? How long are you on here for?"" I say
""About 3h20min"" she says while rolling her eyes
""Oh, that sucks, Yeah I think i'm on here till 8, so about 4 hours"" I sigh

*Idle chit-chat*

I explain to her why i'm on the train, what i'm doing, how i'm going to surprise my Boyfriend. We talk about an assortment of things from School, jobs, people, the smell of satsuma (oh what a laugh that was) as well as reading my ""DETAIL"" Magazine together and pointing out the weird and ugly things. I Learn that her name is Kaitlynn. We had a good chat, she got off in Chatham like she said and then I'm alone for 40 minutes until I reach Windsor. 

*Gets off train and walks in the general direction I think is right*

I arrived at Ed's Place at around 820pm and his roommate greats me and I talk with them for a bit before confessing my absolute hunger and asking if I could take them out for dinner because Edward will be at school till 10 and I wanted to be back before he got home. So His female roommate and Male roommates both take me to ""Downtown"" Windsor. 
""What a dive"", I think.
We end up at Quiznos and order just before they close. 
We walk back to the House. eat. I find that I dislike what I ordered ... very much.

So It's about 1015pm and Edward should be home soon. 
His Male roommate walks over to the door and I hear the door jiggle, ""He's home"" Male roommate states. I grab the flower behind me and stand in the Kitchen thinking ""This is not how I planned this  but oh well"" He comes in and says ""Hi I'm home. I smell Tacos!"" (He smells Quiznos) 
He walks into the Kitchen with his head down looking at his Plam to turn off his music and is signing ""Taco Taco, burrito burr..."" He stops in mid tune and exclaims ""WHAT!....WHAT!.... WHAT!"" Then he WHIPS his Palm on the floor screams ""WHAT"" Again, whips off his Headphones as he stares at me. Female roommate whispers ""This is where you say 'this is for you' and gives flower"" I say ""This is for you"" and hand him the flower. He takes the flower and says ""Oh I have to put this in water"" And roommate goes, ""well you could hug him first"" So he come back over to me and hugs me. His face and ear against my face as we hug, they are a bit cold from outside. We have a good laugh casue he just threw his Palm across the floor and was like ""OMG"" Then I explain how Female roommate 1 helped me in the plan and that I traveled all day to get there. 

So I explain that i'm still hungry casue I didn't eat what I got at Quiznos. and we went to the pizza place and got 3 Medium Pizzas. Went over to his friend Chris's apartment quickly. And then Watched ""Shall We Dance"" after we got back and had Pizza.

Went to bed....

"event","Before January I sat at home all the time and did nothing. I was looking for a job and I haven't worked fo the last 5 days and i'm honestly going crazy. I feel like I have been sitting here for a month. I swear i'm going to start vblogging about how bored I am and i'll lose subscribers. 

But I have applied for 2 other jobs, i'm not sure what's going on right now. I tried Texting my boss tonight and ask her what's going on, and just a general ""Hello"" So far... nothing back...  Anyways, I have been really bored so I have decided that I would actually write a blog instead of wasting that much space on the internet with an uploaded video to YouTube stating what I have/am just written(ing).  

Um I did the school thing today, I'm going to fail. This shite is hard, Like, Biology is not an easy subject. I have to remember every bone in the Skeletal System, Major muscles, Major Parts in the Brain, And two other diagrams that I can' think if right now on top of the work. I swear, I don't know how people do it. Like I can remember it if I had more then A week to learn all this shite, do they not realize I have a Full-Time Job... (Well not right this second lol) 

I have been in a bit of a mood today. Don't really know why, I do actually blame it on waking up on the wrong side of the bed... without music. Edward has been very cheery today with helping and saying ""I love you"" and stuff like that. And it has been helpful :) I think it's the Weather, right now it's raining, I dislike rain... 

Hmmmm.... Things. Seeing as it's been a Month since last time I wrote, I can't really say that a whole lot has happened. Like, I have been working up till this week and Stuff, I have been planning a trip for the end of the summer with Edward before he goes away. That's going to suck... A lot...*sigh* 

Um had someone Message me on YouTube yesterday and said he liked my videos casue he said he was going through some hard times and stuff casue he's gay and that he liked my videos cause it showed how happy I was and that I was comfortable with who I was. He really liked the ""Bois Kissing"" series of videos that I have done. So I thouhgt that, that was nice and it gave me a little smile.... Hmmm I'm smiling now. Aw I helped someone... *yay* Go me. 

So for anyone who doesn't know. I... LOVE... Smallville. I am on Season 5 Now Episode 10 or something I have been watching them like crazy, Downloading all the episodes and stuff, so I'm almost caught up. I dunno why I like it, Always have liked Superman, Never really like a Batman Fan or anything like that, just Superman, Mind you the rest ain't bad. 

Hmmm. I think I have wasted enough time, I'm going to bug Edward soon cause i'm needy like that... Kidding:p 

And seeing as I can't really change anything on here (Like text wise) I'll add a picture of something *searches Internet*

Ah-Ha

Night!

"event","Okay, the first draft is all finished now.  The ending . . . well, it needs some major work.  As does the rest of the story, but at least the first draft is completed.  The final word count came to 77,202 words.  Actually, once I get done revising it and what not, the word count will be a little higher, I think.  There is a lot I need to add back in.  Of course there is some that I need to take out as well, but I think more will be going in than coming out.  Anyway, I'm not going to worry about that for now.  As soon as I am done revising the story and am happy with it, I will post it on the <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/felixferrell/"">website</a>.  Rock and roll."

"event","Nearly done with the first draft.  Over 72,000 words now, and ready to write the climax or what have you.  Then there'll be a little chapter to tidy things up and raise some questions for the second story.  Yup.  And then I need to go back and rewrite the entire story, but I'll wait until December for that, since <a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org/"" target=""_blank"">NaNoWriMo</a>'s deadline is the 30th of November.  Once I finish writing and editing the whole thing, I think I'm going to be really happy with it, which is unusual for my writing.  So that's good."

"event","Broke 50,000 today.  Yee haw.  Actually, my word count is well over 52,000 now.  And I'd say I'm about, oh, halfway done with the story.  Of course I'm gonna have to go back and cut a ton of it out.  The beginning in particular needs to be changed.  It was such a mess that I took it off of the site.  However, I did put up  an updated <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/felixferrell/characters.html"">characters</a> page.  Anyway, I'm gonna keep chugging along here, and see if I can't reach 55,000 before I go to bed.

"event","Well, I'm now over two thirds of the way to 50,000 words.  And according to my outline, I'm not even a fourth of the way through the actual story yet. Just for fun, I set the margins to match <i>The Curse of the Blue Figurine</i> by John Bellairs, and I'm already at 155 pages.  Assuming I really am only a fourth of the way through, that would mean my book should end up being well over 600 pages.  That's just plain silly."

"event","Mercy.  My word count jumped up to 24,556 today.  That means I'm almost halfway to 50,000.  That's kind of crazy.  What's also crazy is that I am nowhere even remotely close to finishing the story.  It's barely even started.  I just introduced the main villain, and the second main character just now revealed her name, like, at 24,540 words.  This thing'll be longer than all the Harry Potters put together by the time I'm done.  Well, maybe not that long.  Anyway, I like where the story's going.  The last scene I just wrote wasn't quite up to par, so I'll have to redo that, but for the most part, I'm pretty happy with it.  Of course, it still very much needs to be edited, but I'll worry about that in December.  I gotta get to bed."

"event","Darn, it's late.  Again.  And since I'm in a <i>good, bad, & ugly</i> mood, here we go:<br>
<b>the good</b>: my word count is 13033<br>
<b>the bad</b>: I'm pretty sure my story sucks<br>
<b>the ugly</b>: my outline is divided into 20 chapters & I just started chapter 2<br>
So the bottom line then is that I'm just writing too much.  I can feel myself doing it as I write.  Probably need to spend more time on interesting things happening and less time on talking about ""feelings"" and junk.  This ain't <i>Snow Falling On Cedars</i>.  Actually, it's far more sentimental or what have you than I intended.  There's way too much crying, but it'll all get axed come December, don't you worry.  
<br>
Also, I was reading Lemony Snicket's <i>Unauthorized Autobiography</i> today, and there's a little section on <I>Zombies In The Snow</i>, where one character wants to befriend the zombies.  Which was going to be the basic storyline of the second Felix Ferrell story, <i>Felix Ferrell Meets Christmas Doom</i>.  So now I can't do that or everyone will think I'm just ripping of Lemony Snicket.  Which, basically, I am, but I wasn't when I came up with that.  Rats.  There goes the whole second installment of my epic saga.<br>
Nyeh, I'll do it anyway.  You can't have too many stories about a horde of evil zombies turned good through the magic of friendship.  No you can't.

Scrap everything I said yesterday, because that main villain, although he is quite evil, only shows up briefly in this particular story. Also, there is no longer a zombie army - that, too, will show up in a later story. If you <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/felixferrell/"">look around the site</a>, you'll see that the new title is <i>Felix Ferrell & the Haunted Liberry</i>. Yes, Li<i>berry</i>, not Library. Although it is, in fact, a library that is haunted. The story outline is completely finished now. It's hard to believe that I actually completed an entire outline. It's rather vague right now, at least in parts, but the whole story is there, so now it's just a matter of writing the silly thing. Hopefully I'll be able to start tonight after midnight, if the neighborhood kids haven't broken in and slaughtered me for eating candy in front of them instead of placing it in their plastic pumpkin pails. Mmmmmmm hmmmmmmm. Anyway, everything for the story is all set, so if everything goes correctly, in one month the first Felix Ferrell story will be finished. Hoo flippin' rah."

"event","Hmmmmm. 
Been working on a character who has turned out to be the main villain. Which is good, but now I need to rethink the whole story. And I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to change the title. Here's a list of potential new titles:<i>
Felix Ferrell Versus The Zombies
Felix Ferrell Bakes A Zombie Pie
Felix Ferrell Raises the Dead
Felix Ferrell Versus the Army Of The Dead
Felix Ferrell in Night Of The Pie Loving Dead</i>
There's gonna be a zombie army in the story now, see. And pie. Lots of zombies and lots of pie. Or maybe just one pie, I don't know. Anyway, those titles aren't cutting it either, I don't think, so maybe I'll just use a working title, which I guess is all I was doing in the first place. A'ight, so the new working title is:
<i>Felix Ferrell in Night of the Pie Loving Dead</i>
And yes, I just picked the worst one. Oh well. Anyway, hopefully the outline of the whole story will be done today, so everything'll be set for Saturday. Yes.
Have a safe All Hallow's Eve."

"event","Working more on the story outline. Last night I sketched out more of the characters, I'll scan 'em in later and put 'em on <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/felixferrell/"">the site</a> somewhere. Felix himself now looks like a wimpy Superman. Zola looks Asian for some reason. And Christmas Doom looks just like Peter Orson, which is pretty radical. So anyway, I'll try to get them up <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/felixferrell/"">there</a> soon, keep checking back. OR ELSE!"

"event","Eureka! Not only is that fun to say, it's our state motto!
Anyway, today...what in Peter Orson's name did I do today? Oh yeah! I worked out the kinks in the back story, so now I have a full understanding in my own head of what's going on and what not, at least as far as the background of the whole story. Turns out I was making things more complicated than I really needed to. Anyway, I'm getting the story all lined up and by this time next week, I'm confident I'll be all set to pound this baby out. Maybe anyone who uses the phrase ""all set to pound this baby out"" should be forbidden from writing.
I don't think I mentioned it, but yesterday I created a new character for the story. His name is Christmas Doom. Originally he was going to be named Peter Orson, but that's really almost sacrilegious. Plus I think Christmas Doom is an awesome name for an eleven year old kid. If I was eleven, I'd rename myself Christmas Doom. Ah heck, I may just do it anyway. Chester Hulk Smash Christmas Doom Coon. Best name ever.
Oh, I also found out today that a Lemony Snicket character wears a dark green suit all the time, so I'm gonna have to change my character from Eerie Man In Green Suit to Eerie Man In Brown Suit. Hopefully that won't affect the outcome of the story. I also realized today that my story is essentially ripping off everything from Star Wars to ""Ninjai: the Little Ninja"" to Buffy The Vampire Slayer to, well, Lemony Snicket. Oh well. There's nothing new under the sun, as they say. And by ""they"" I mean both Coalesce and the guy who wrote Ecclesiastes."

"event","Started working on the outline last night, and actually got quite a bit done. There are, of course, large gaping holes in the story still (i.e. what the whole conflict/major plot is), but I'll get those taken care in due time. Things seem to be going relatively well, though, and I'm happy with the progress I'm making.
I would put all my notes and everything on here, but I decided against it since that would give away what little of the story I do have. What I need to work on and put up here are character sketches. Drawing the characters will help me visualize them and get a better feel for them when I actually start writing. Too bad I'm not so hott at drawing. Or writing.
Also, I really need to bang out character and place names. All I have are the main characters and the one major town so far, and the town (Dodd's End) is pretty much just my last name. Dodd's End. Dodson. Aren't I clever? No. No I am not. BUT, the name Dodd's End actually does have meaning as far as the back story goes, so it all works out nicely, I think.
Speaking of Dodd's End, there's a map up now. It's not finished since, as I mentioned, I still need to come up with place names. But you can at least get the general idea of the layout of the town. In case you're wondering, Felix's house is in the very upper right hand corner, next to the cemetery. Also, in case you're wondering, Felix is the main character. In Felix Ferrell Versus The Daemons.
Anyway, keep checking back because I hope to get a lot of fun stuff on here. I don't know what exactly, so I'll be just as surprised as you. Hoorah! Thank you for taking the time to read this."

I have a back story coming along and I find myself getting really into it, so that's a good sign, I suppose. Hopefully I can make it interesting to other readers, too. Time'll tell, so they say."

"event","Signed up for this year's NaNoWriMo. Hopefully this year will go a little better than last, seeing as how last year I didn't even know what the hey I was writing about. This year I actually plan on making some sort of outline or something, developing characters and such, all before I start writing. That, I hope, will make a big difference. A year later I still don't know what I was writing about last year. Nyeh.
.....Anyway, the story idea this year will be something of a rip-off of John Bellairs - a wikked creepy kid's story with lots of evil demons and junk. Should be a hot ticket. We'll see, anyway..."

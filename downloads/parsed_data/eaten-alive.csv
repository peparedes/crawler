"event","A funny thing happened to me Saturday night.

After Murder by Death destroyed a great deal of the conscious thought center in my brain, I stood further back in the crowd to watch Lucero. I had my dad's digital camera with me, so I took a couple of blurry pictures. But since my brain was, like I said, very much destroyed, I didn't have the attention span to keep from getting distracted. And when my head is lolling around distracted at shows, I tend to watch and notice people. Especially girls, because old habits die hard and all. But the old habits aren't what I wanted to talk about.
Of the people and, like I said, girls I noticed, and subsequently watched, there were two that didn't catch my attention more than any others. But this story is about them, or at least one of them, so I have to introduce them now. They were both thin, average height, shortish dark hair, dressed mostly in black. Nothing unheard of at a show, you might say. But I noticed these girls again when one of them, the one the story's about, turned and started walking in my direction, and when she walked straight up to me I looked right at her. And when she came right next to me and lifted her head, I bent down and put my ear towards her. You know, shows are loud and that's what you do. And while I waited for her whispered message to trickle down my ear, she kissed me on the cheek. Or the part of the face between the cheek and ear. I don't know if that part has a name or not.
I turned to say something, or maybe just have her notice my stupefied, sheepish grin, but she was nearly out the door. And I turned and looked at her friend, and I asked with my grin ""What the fuck just happened?"" And she smiled and walked towards the stage, and disappeared into the crowd.
Things like this don't really happen to me, you understand.
So I walked over towards the ticket table where Jacq was working, and I didn't see this Mystery Kisser along the way. So I sat at the table and told her the story, and she let me know that that's weird for anyone, not just me. Sometimes I need to be told that. And we talked about how sexual Murder by Death's cellist plays, and what a tragedy it is that she is more than likely dating the singer. I showed Jacq the pictures I'd taken of the cellist, and in the process trying to figure out how the damn camera worked. During that time Lucero had finished, and the Weakerthans had been taking their time setting up..
I was sitting cross-legged on the table hunched over, poring over the camera's inch and a half screen and four little buttons, when the Mystery Kisser snuck up on me again. She said, ""Hi, my name is Stephanie. I kissed you earlier.""
I said, ""I remember that. Nice to meet you, my name's Steve."" As soon as I'd said my name, my remaining faculties of conscious thought began to whir, and I noticed the similarities between our names.
She said, ""Would you like to come watch the Weakerthans with me?""
I said, ""Um, sure.""
She said, ""I'm the Weakerthans' biggest fan, so don't be thrown off if I'm singing and dancing a lot."" I told her I wouldn't be at all.
I followed her to her friend's roost near the front of the stage, and we introduced ourselves further. Disclosing deep and personal information, like that she lives and goes to school in San Francisco, and studies Sociology. She introduced me to all her friends too, the ones who were roosting, but I honestly can't remember any of their names.
And then the Weakerthans began playing.
Have you ever watched someone watch their favorite band before? I highly recommend it. The unfettered joy of each note played exactly as they've heard it so many times before. The tenth of a second of pause at the beginning of each song, cross referencing that intro with their encyclopedic knowledge of the bands discography. The jumping, the dancing, the singing along. It's just so great to watch people be happy, to watch them have passion.
And they faux-finished their set, because they knew they were going to have an encore and the crowd knew they were going to have an encore. And after a minimal of chanting to convince them, the Weakerthans returned to the stage, and Stephanie and I stood closer to the front of the stage. And they played this one song, I didn't know what it was called, because as I warned Stephanie I'm not particularly familiar with the Weakerthans, so I had to Google it to find exactly what the lyrics were.

<i>How I don't know what I should do with my hands when I talk to you. 
How you don't know where you should look, so you look at my hands.</i>

And at that exact moment in time, like two watches suddenly becoming synchronized, like a lunar eclipse, my left hand happened to be awkwardly floating in dead space between us. So I put it on her back. What would you have done? But I quickly took it away again, of course, because otherwise I wouldn't know how to explain myself to her. And how would I be able to explain that I was immeasurably grateful that she shared her love of this band with me. That she made my night just as much as seeing one of my top 5 or 10 favorite bands. That I was still completely aware of the fact that she was still a stranger. That I'd start downloading everything I could find by the Weakerthans immediately. That I greatly enjoyed this little time capsule but the last thing I wanted was for us to be half blind, club-handed, making out. That through the night, despite Mystery Kissing and Sexual Cello, my thoughts were fixed on another.
So when the music ended for real, after the encore, and everyone knew it, I tapped Stephanie on the shoulder. And she turned to me, and I bent down and kissed her on that nameless place between the ear and the cheek. And I ran away.

But I had managed to take a picture.

but then i'm walking home from school, and i'm in the middle of the fog, and it's so fucking awesome, like someone put a barbara walters fuzz lens on the world and now everything looks positively beautiful. except barbara walters. thank god i don't have to see her when i'm walking down the street.

And, failing that option, what <i>is</i> supposed to make me happy? I wonder if people see me sitting there in the corner, not drinking, and mistake my detatchment for self-righteousness.

I'm not social enough to be a social drinker. Do I hate parties because I hate people? I always say I hate people, but what if it's true? Finally, how the fuck are you supposed to meet girls who don't drink or at least, don't like alcohol-centric social events, in college? I have a suspicion there are some more people out there, who think like me, but they're shut in their rooms saturday nights too. Maybe they're writing in their stupid fucking journals too.

Thursday was an amazing night. I drove to San Francisco, besting Rush Hour Traffic (minus jackie chan and benicio del torro) to see first Converge, then immediately after their set ended I shot off to the Bottom of the Hill for Do Make Say Think. Whenever I go to two widely differing events like that, I wonder if anyone else did too. I should think, if they also loved each band enough they'd never forgive themselves if they'd missed either one, that i would like to be their friend, based on that alone. Well, one person i know of went to both, my friend colin, who i ran into at the converge show and he decided to ride back with me so i wouldn't have to drive alone, even though he'd never heard DMST before.

I walked across town to the lompoc DMV today to renew my permit, the same building in which I have failed the driver's test twice and not been allowed to take it once. It was closed. I hereby swear I will never return there without grenades, and should that day come I will indeed destroy it. It is a den of otherworldy evil visited upon the earth, a scourge whose only place is in hell.

Walking home from the DMV I came across a man with an ice cream cart. I had seen him as I was walking there, I followed him for 3 blocks and he didn't make a single sale. So I decided to buy an ice cream sandwich, hoping to make both of our days better. Overcoming the enormous barrier of language I managed to indeed purchase an ice cream sandwich, and I unrapped it as I walked away and bit through the soft cookie outside. But not the ice cream, as it was apparently forged of a top secret government superalloy designed to not only destroy the teeth of angry people snubbed by the DMV but also as a replacement for kevlar in bulletproof vests. Instead of just becoming more angry, I marvelled at it my entire walk home. I also ate it...somehow. It was good.

Six months later he decided the God of Cupcakes was the God of Emptiness and Despair in disguise, so he began to pray to the God of Ice Cream.

And Lo, miraculously a fine rain of water swept from the heavens and down upon the land, and the Monolatrist thrilled at his current God's fidelity to him.

last night versailles played here and it was really fucking rad. I had a great time at the show, an even better time seeing all you sb/goleta kids I never get to see, but i will get to once summer comes. But then that means I won't get to see SC kids. There's just no pleasing me.
Dan Dan stayed in my room last night and that was cool. I haven't done anything all day and I'm really proud of that. Yesterday I was all active and shit, I went downtown and found the comic book shop Hiram told me about and bought the last volume of Transmetropolitan, and read it on the bus, in the dining hall, and out on the lawn. Fucking amazing. Everyone read it, right now. I also bought the new remastered Fanning the Flames of Discontent because i didn't have it and I needed it.

I don't have anything more to say. the world is still a fucked up/amazing place.

"event","Well, i suppose I finally have to write about coachella, don't I?

jesus.

the entire adventure started in my philosophy class, 3 hours before my bus to sb left, when i finally decided not to try and sell my ticket.
on the way there i saw cool things, like a street named ""foletta"" in soledad or gonzales or some shit town. I also saw a van with ""coachella or bust"" written on the back. and then, the highlight of my day was this black dude in the salinas bus station asking me if i had any pot. got in to sb, saw my dad, that was cool.
friday, evan couldn't make the 3:00 departure due to the whole band+record label shizazz, so at around 6:30 roz came by and I GOT TO SEE ROZ! aw yaaay. and we went over to evan's, owen was already there, we all waited for him. i told roz dead baby jokes, and probably scarred her for life. finally around 8 we left to indio, and holy shit. i had good chinese food at a really neat restaurant along the way, and i got the most obvious fortune cookie ever. ""you will find good fortune in love"". duuuuh. Anyhow, we got to indio and those kids+the kids we met up with down there partied it up like it was coachella 2004, because it was. And I finally got to meet Roz's and Avian's boys. I approve.
Saturday! Weirdest day ever. actually, this whole thing was the weirdest weekend ever, but this was the pinnacle of weirdness. It all started with owen realizing he had forgotten his tickets. We went on, him scalping, through egregious heat into indio for the festival. I immediately split off from those homies...top 5 for the first day.
5) getting a hug from a random drunk lady. Or the (international) noise conspiracy, even though they played the exact same set i saw them play a few weeks ago. 
4) The Pixies. They were just really good.
3) Trail of Dead. They added a second drummer. They played an amazing set, including Intelligence which i didn't think they'd play. They are simply a great band.
2) MOTHERFUCKING TESLA COIL! For those of you who've never played C&C: Red Alert, a tesla coil is a tower that shoots lightning. And they had a real one at Coachella.
1) Radiohead. Oh my god, this was amazing, even though I was on the verge of collapsing from lack of food and water, and the motherfucking heat. In fact, maybe that made it even better.
So we get out of the festival and WTF evan's car wouldn't start! no batteries! after unsuccessful jumping attempts, we decide to deal with this the next day and all pile in harrison's car to get back to the hotel. I volunteered to ride in the trunk for the 30+ mile ride. It was way awesome. Then, we were so hungry we made our way to denny's for the second time in one day, though i hadn't ordered anything the first time. I hadn't eaten in probably 14 hours, so naturally we had to wait an hour before we got any food, though we were thankfully entertained by white trash superstars: a metalhead who said savage and appreciated 'double kickers' and a long haired freak who refered to a dude's cock as his 'dallywhacker'.
Sunday! We did it right, although we did miss !!!. that was way sad. top 5:
5) AIR. I don't get them yet, but when i did i was feeling it.
4) Mogwai. I only saw like 15-20 mins of their set, but it was so amazing, so intense, so fucking good.
3) Belle and Sebastian. This band really made it work. I have a whole new respect for them, and i need to listen to them more now. plus i fell in love with a girl in the crowd during their set.
oh well!
2) Broken Social Scene. Blew my mind. I really like the way they work their band, and have all their friends coming in and playing songs. They played that one song that i really like, the one i'm listening to right now...and then the guitarist proposed to his girlfriend on stage and it was so fucking beautiful.
1) Flaming Lips. Jesus, i could have sworn i was on drugs. 15 people in animal costumes dancing on stage. The singer descending from outer space in a giant bubble, then prancing about upon the crowd in it. fists of fury and nun puppets galore. definitely one of the best live shows i've ever seen, and i don't throw that around lightly.
Well we finally figured out evan's car, then spent a half hour to an hour in the parking lot rounding up everyone and finding harrison's car, and then we got out quite painlessly. We were locked out of our room, but used our magic powers and got in. me and evan watched some weird fucking tv shows back at the hotel, including a documentary on prostitution. swiping credit cards in buttcracks is scary, kids.
Monday! Farewell to the hotel! Everything was going fine, though owen was paranoid as fuck, until we got to summerland and ran out of gas, and had to push the car into the gas station. meanwhile my creative writing assignment was due shortly! thankfully I got it in on time, all thanks to jacq, who i now owe my soul to. My dad then took me to the restaurant he works at and bought me dinner, and it was super good. Finally at midnight it was time to get back on the bus and return to SC. Sleep did not accompany me on my journey, however, and the melatonin that was supposed to help it come about did nothing but make it so i couldn't do anything but sleep. so i was just miserable. oh yeah, and brendan from dp theater who goes to sc was on the bus too, also getting back from coachella. small world.

i got back to find melanie in my bed, and the rest of today unfolded in that manner. i got to see pretty much every single one of the great people i know up here. and i'm happy. goodnight."

Oh yes, and then there's the coachella thing. Turns out i don't know how i'm getting there, or where I'm staying, after all. I am at a crisis, or maybe a crux. I like that word better. Sell or scramble? If someone could help, either with rides or to buy a ticket, i would owe you my soul.

anyhow, i also got a super awesome book full of art and such called Empire, and mr. numbskull let me in the show free for flyering! and then the show happened, time in malta played a bunch of their new stuff and it sounds fucking excellent now that they have 2 guitars, the moving units were also way rad, and the international noise conspiracy was also very good, although they played almost all new stuff. oh well...
more adventures with the visiting girls, and by the end of the weekend they had to leave, and that was very sad. so i played a song on the guitar. did i mention i got my new guitar? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm in love.
Today i had a midterm for psych, which i think i did alright on, and then i procrastinated horribly my creative writing assignment, but i got by on that too, i think.

the video game tournament was a total wash. i didn't show up until 10 the next day, only to find no 1 on 1 smash brothers. i would have destroyed everyone. i still will...in real life.
today i went downtown and ""read"" with beka, but we mostly talked. about life and everything. but not the universe, god no. and then came dinner with siri and her friends. it was way fun, though not for the reasons i was so anxious about... buuut the conversation online afterwards made up for it. i'm so anxious. who talks like this. who flirts like this. except her. amazing. or i hope this is flirtation...i've always been terrible at discerning such matters.

It seems in tribute to the dearest friends i love
Displays of appreciation I've been lacking
And now comes the time to do what i've spoken of,
Those who do not receive this deserve a sacking
You'd be jealous of these friends, that or enamored
And if your reaction was to the contrary,
I'd assume you were stupid, stoned, dead, or hammered.
My dedication to them will never vary
And though i'd never dare to mention them by name
For fear of omitting some vital component
(Like attempting to make a computer mainframe
And ending up making a toaster with a dent)
All i can say is that i'm committed to you
And the times that we have yet to go through

slow weekend, good for relaxing. valentineawhat? fugg dat. the highlight of that day was receiving a really really nice phone call.

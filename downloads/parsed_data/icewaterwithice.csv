I was driving to my house after dropping Justin off at work this morning and I realized that the last couple of days have been like summer.  Cruzin' around, windows rolled down, blasting Sublime.  Aah, good times...and of course it was enhanced by the fact that I had a 36"" x 36"" gallery canvas in the back of my truck that I got for 75 CENTS!!  That's right, you read that correctly, 75 cents.  Today is a good day.  I think I'm going to lay in the sun for a while."

"event","Most of you will probably not care about this, but I find these facts a little frightening.  If you don't care about the environment don't read it.  But otherwise, here are a few excerpts from an article written by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that interested me.


By Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
EarthLight Magazine #52, Winter 2005

""We know that the principal source of ozone and particulates in our air is coming from 1,100 coal-burning power plants that are burning coal illegally. They were supposed to install controls over fifteen years ago. The Clinton administration was prosecuting 75 of the worst of those plants. But this industry gave $48 million to President Bush during the 2000 campaign, and they've contributed $58 million since. One of the first things that President Bush did when he came to office was to order the Justice Department to drop all 75 of those suits.""

""We are cutting down the mountains, literally cutting them down. The coal companies blow off the tops of the mountains, using 2,500 tons of dynamite in West Virginia alone every year...They do it by blowing off the tops of the mountains, and they take that rubble and they dump it into the adjacent river valley. They've already covered up 1,200 miles of our streams. We are destroying, flattening this landscape that is a part of American history. It's the source of our values, our virtues, our character as a people; the landscapes, the mountains where Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone roamed, and we are cutting them to the ground. Of course it's illegal, you cannot take rubble and debris and toxic waste and dump it into a river without a Clean Water Act permit, and the Clean Water Act could never let you get a permit to do that. So we sued. Joe Lovett, the attorney from West Virginia, sued the Bush administration and the Army Corps of Engineers for allowing this practice to happen. We won the lawsuit, and the judge enjoined all mountain top mining. Two days from that victory, the Bush administration rewrote the Clean Water Act to allow mountain top mining to continue forever; not only that, but changed the structure of the act so that anybody can dump rubble and debris simply by getting a rubber stamp permit from the Corps of Engineers.""

""I have an American Heritage Dictionary, and the definition, if you look up fascism, says, ""the domination of government by large corporations driven by right-wing ideology and bellicose nationalism"" that's getting to look pretty familiar."""

His passing is a great loss to journalism and American literature.  He was the best journalist of the 20th century.  R.I.P. Hunter."

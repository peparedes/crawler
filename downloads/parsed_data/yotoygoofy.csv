"event","What a fucking amazing show.  The writing is so good.  And the behind-the-scenes special on CBS showed that the writers are not all pimply twenty-somethings who don't have a fuckin' clue about life.  This is a mature show because it's written by mature people.  Alright, I know, I know.  Not all twenty-somethings are clueless, but it's such a numbers game in TV.  God forbid you should be over 35 and think about writing for TV."

"event","I love all things Peanuts.  I think that Charles M. Schulz was a genius.  When I was a little kid, Schulz was my best friend even if he didn't know it.  In all of the turmoil of my dysfunctional family and resulting from my parent's splitting up, the Peanuts gang was there to cheer me up and make life less stressful.

I actually had a chance to thank Schulz for contributing the Peanuts strip to the world.  In 1996 I wrote him a fan letter, which took me all night to get out, as I kept writing and rewriting.  It had to be just right!  A couple of months later, I got a letter in response and a numbered, limited edition, large print of a drawing of Linus and Snoopy (which had been used for the cover of the book celebrating the strip's 45th anniversary).  Then in 2001, I bought the book, THE ART OF CHARLES M. SCHULZ, and discovered that my fan letter had been quoted twice in the book.  I couldn't believe it!  And in 2002 I got a letter from Jeanne Schulz asking if I would allow the soon-to-open Charles M. Schulz Museum to display my letter.  I was thrilled, of course.  When the museum opened, I was there.  My cousin and I drove up all night from L.A., to get there in time for the charter member's opening.  And then we went back the next day when the museum opened officially to the public.

The thing is that the Peanuts' strip has always felt so personal to me.  It still does.  It's as if it's been created for my own personal amusement--it's a secret that only Schulz and I share.  Yet when I was at the museum, I was in the company of several hundreds of people who all felt the same way.  I remember tearing up a little as I walked around and feeling somewhat embarrassed by my reaction until I saw a couple of other fans equally as moved.

There's a little bit of each of the Peanuts' characters in me.  I can be the neurotic Charlie Brown, the brilliantly insightful Linus, the know-it-all and crabby Lucy, and even the clueless Sally.  My imagination runs wild, much like Snoopy's, and I can be naive like Woodstock, occasionally a bit sloppy like Pigpen, and sometimes barely get by in life like Peppermint Patty.  And yet, I always feel like I can do it all when I'm surrounded by all things Peanuts."

"event","I used to think that Murphy's Law was a bunch of hogwash.  That everything that could go wrong didn't necessarily have to go wrong.  But after this week, I have converted.  Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong, and then some.  The worse part of all this is that I ended up spending the half the week fighting with people and then the second half of the week eating crow and apologizing.

I've managed to fight with my boss (who always deserves it and will never get an apology from me), fight with executives at a movie studio (who turned out not to deserve it), fight with a film lab (who had provided me with a detailed list of items that they needed me to turn over to them and which my assistant promptly forgot to give me), fight with a friend because she cut me off during a meeting, fight with another co-worker who also cut me off during a meeting, and fight with my assistant for all the fights that he made me get into when he forgot to give me the aforementioned fax.  I have no fight left in me!  Literally.

But the really worse part of it all is that I've turned into a complete sniveling idiot.  I fight like a mad dog and then end up crying like a sniveling baby.  I'm not kidding here.  I can barely get the words of anger out when I can feel the tears welling up in my eyes and I turn into a blubbering idiot, raging against whoever is  pissing me off.

And here's the kicker....I'm usually one of those annoying really jovial and fairly good natured people, who goof around a lot and usually want to make you laugh no matter how much you're not in the mood for it.  So, I now must believe in Murphy's Law because everything that could go wrong, did, in fact, go wrong for me this week, including my sense of humor and my personality--those two, also went wrong."

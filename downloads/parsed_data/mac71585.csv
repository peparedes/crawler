<P><FONT size=2>the other day i typed this into my profile:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>I've never realized just how hard growing up was until i realized<FONT color=#000000> that the people i've loved and grown up&nbsp; with my entire life started to leave one by one out of this town and into their new lives. i miss you already everyone!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>the sad thing is.. not everyone has left yet.. and not everyone is going to leave.. i feel like i have wasted an entire summer working and not being able to spend time with those who i have been with my entire life pretty much.. i havent seen half the people i have wanted to see and i wont get that chance until december vacation.. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=1>i know it seems really sad and all.. but yeah.. i havent started college yet so maybe ill change my mind once i go myself.. and make new friends.. but i just hate it when i look at&nbsp; a friends away message that has left and it mentions something like ""out making new friends"".. im scared i wont make new friends when im at fitchburg.. and to tell u the truth i dont really want to.. i hate change.. and i know its goign to happen whether or not i want it to.. but yeah.. i wish i was living at college because then i'd know what everyone is talking about when i talk to them.
also its kinda sad too that i miss people.. but i really miss people that i only talk to once and a while.. but yeah.. blah.. its going to be a very lonely town for the next couple months

"event","<H2><FONT size=4>So it really hasnt hit me yet that the class of 2004 is out of school.... it hasnt hit me yet that we will never be in the same school again..all together.. i still keep thinking that tuesday morning we will be back in the same classes.. and ill get to see my friends everyday. .. but we wont.. i mean yeah we will see each other again.. its not like we never will.. but it just wont ever be the same... i was talking to my old friend.. and he told me that i am in for many big changes.. and i guess i've always known that after highschools over i will be faced with changes.. but i never knew how fast high school would end.. i know everyone says ""i hate highschool"".. and somedays i feel that way too... but then i look back on it like i have done for the passed few days.. and i realized how much i actually loved highschool..&nbsp; and its all because of the people that i went with.. i love my friends to death.. and im so going to miss not seeing them everyday in class.. .. im going to miss not having sewing w/ ashley and maya.. it was alwasy a good time.. all we ever did was laugh...&nbsp; im going to miss 3rd period studies .. and even though i havent realy hung out with some of the people in the study.. we alwasy had a good time... and although we have all changed i will always remember the times we all hung out together..&nbsp; 6th period with katlyn i will miss.. Mrs Lents english class.. where although sometimes i wanted to shoot everyone in that class.. i've relized just how much fun that class truly was because of all the guys.. .. then yearbook.. what can i say abotu that.. me jess, maya, beth, alicia, stacy, sean, jenna.. it was an awesome time. so many funny things happening...&nbsp; how im going to miss all of it.. and i know that every school year u think back on all the good times... but i can proudly say that senior year was definatly one of my best years to remember.. .. there will never be another class like the class of 2004.... nothign will ever replace it.. and although when we graduate from college we will feel just as important being the class of 2008.... it will never compare with our lil class of 120 or so kids.. who have pretty much grown up together... and have seen each other grow up into amazing adults.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i love the class of 2004.. and although we have 1 more week together.. i will miss you dearly... </FONT></H2>

"event","today was an alright day

work up.. at like 6:30 got dressed drove to work.. almost died a few times bcause of the roads being way nasty.. then i made it work at like 7:45. 15 minutes early .. and we were really slow.. then finally atl ike 8:15 julia showed up (15 minutes late).. and then paulet like 10 minutes after her.. so then at like 8:40 my mom and dad and grammy showed up so i sat and talked to them for a while.. then they left and ashley and her mom and dad came in to have breakfast.. at this time we got busier.. so then  i talked to them for a while.. then i went in the kitchen talked to nick.. and john.. had to act semi sad becaue it was supposed to be the lasted day lol..  yeah right.. it really wasnt just it was a secret becuse the cook and waitress couldnt know because they aren going to be working breakfast anymore... so then at like 11 they decided it wasnt busy enough to keep me there so they gave me my money and i acted all sad and gave julia, ann, and paulette(the waitress that has no idea that breafkast is still going on after she leaves) a hug to say goodbye because u know.. ""it was over"" yeah right lol.. so then  i went in the kitchen said bye to john.. and gave him a hug.. then i said bye to danny (the cook that is leavign and has no idea breakfast is still going).. so then i saw nick (the really hot guy who is taking over breakfast) and i said bye and that i'd miss him and hes like oh yeah ill miss u too but ull be back soon enough (which is next sunday lol).. and then i gave him a hug and stuff.. and said i'd be back to visit at lunch time becaue i had nothing else to do.. so then i came home
i changed
went down to shaws..  picked up a cake and and them write ""happy birthday NIck"" (tomorrow is nick, the hott guys 21st birthday) so then i bought a card that said something like this "" on your 21st birthday, i hope u get everything u ever asked for because someone as unique and special and caring as you deserves everything they want in the world"" (or somethignlike that) and then i put some money in it and then i bought him a bag of candy because he was asking for some earlier at work.. and then i got him a balloon, i then went back to the trainstop (where paullete, ann, and julia, john and danny were still there as well as nick) i got in just when nick walked out of the kitchen i walked over gave him the card, balloon, and candy.. he said aww what is this and i go its for you so then hes like oh thank u so much  and i was like ur welcome hes like im going to go open the card in the kitchen ill be back out in a  few minutes im like ok.. so the he went in and then like 3 minutes later i went in to see if he liked it and then he pulled me over and said that i didnt have to do that and that it was to much and stuff and i was like no its not that hes done so much for me within the last few months so then hes like ur such a sweetie kinda thing so then he opened the candy loved the candy.. so then he followed me out front and saw the cake and  decided to cut it and he loved it lol.. so then he walked around w/ the balloon hainging otu of his hat.. so then i stayed there for a while and hung out and then my gram came in so i just sat w/ her for half hour and then she left.. so then i went and said bye again to the waitresses and this time it was like 2:30.. so then i went in the kitchen said bye again.. went over to john and said bye... and then i went to nick and said bye and he still said i did to much and i said no and gave him another hug and left...
after that i came home.. did homework.. then gram came over..then she left
my mom cooked corn dogs for dinner (i hate hotdogs) and so i just pealed the corn bread off of it and ate that and then had the best time playing w/ the hotdog on a stick.. i was using it as a lightsaber from starwars.. making april crack up.. and sarah a little.. then i put it on my head and said this is so aliens cant read my thoughts... then i put it to my nose and siad i swear im not lieing.. it was halarious i guess lol.. well thats all now im online..

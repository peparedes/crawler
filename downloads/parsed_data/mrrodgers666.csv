<font size=""1"">I drove up to the city at night and found the place
Where you grew up and then where you stayed
And we walked around and stayed up late under city lights
I spent the night, next to you in the house where you grew up
Next to you I miraculously woke up
In your parents' house I laid in bed with you

I went back to feel alone there
I went back to wipe it clean

I took the lights and radio towers out of my dreams
And we went all the way up to the small town where I'm from
With foggy air and the wind and the mountain top
And we clung to rocks and looked off and you held my hand
You almost got to start feeling me
I finally felt like I was breathing free
Under swaying trees we fell asleep and we had the same dream
The stars were bright, we dream the same every night
On my island home I spent some time with you

I went back to feel alone there
I went back there by myself
I gave up on everything that we'd felt

We found a precious place in the sand right out in the wind
And we laid under a blanket and heard the furious sound
The roar of waves, the pounding surf, two bodies on the earth
It was intense just getting to be there next to you
And you trying to get me then, and I was happy to let you in

I went back and wished I hadn't
I went back and felt regret
I went to the beach and I stared west

Every night when the sun went down in the town where we lived
The empty streets were lit up by reflected light from a distant sun
Bouncing off a glowing ball of rock and we just laid on the roof
And watched the moon, the moon, the blue light of the moon
We didn't talk and silently we both felt powerful
And, like the moon, my chest was full because we both knew
We're just floating in space over molten rock
And we felt safe and we discovered that our skin is soft
There's nothing left except certain death
And that was comforting at night out under the moon

I went out last night to forget that
I went out and stared it down
But the moon stared back at me
And in it's light I saw my two feet on the ground"

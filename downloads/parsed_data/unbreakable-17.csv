"event","school holidays have been great, friday nighti hung out in frankston then me and laura went to kylie's house and watched movies. it was really good, everyone was farting all night. silly girls, i took the girls to maccas before going home to my bed, :D sat i worked in the morning then went to frankston again to speak to laura about alex's birthday present that we had to get for his party that night, we ended up getting him a bottle of vodka and a barbie doll. i dont know which was his favourite. lol. me and lori brought birthday banners and decorations. but we ended up wearing the deocorations around our waist, mkaing them look like skirts. :D Sat night was a really fun night, i didnt get home till about 1 or 2 then i went straight to sleep. 

sunday morning i woke up at 7:10am and started packing to go away up to mansfield for the night. i left my place at 7:40am and went to Al's house where we packed his car full of all our stuff and left about 8:30am. there were five of us going, Al, Erin, Joel, Kai and myself. it took about 3 hours to get up there, i had travle sickness all the way and was laying across kai with my eyes closed most of the time trying not to think about all the windey roads. we got to mansfield where everyone got lunch and i had an iced coffee big M. later on is occured to me i should not have drank milk, we got to the property and unpacked all the stuff from the car into one bedroom. we then went to gouphs bay and a few other places which made me feel really sick, my milk nearly came up a few times.. not good, and then i started getting a cold to top things off. :( we got back to the property where we just hung out and went for a walk around the property and to the end of the drive way where burnt bridge was.. :) when the sun started to set we went up this dirt road to see kangaroos. we saw 5 and that was it. then we headed back into mansfield and had dinner at the pub, it was really good i had chicken parmagiana, i ate all the chips and like 5 small mouthfulls of the chicken then i was full.. so everyone else ate my dinner. we went back to the house and Erin and Joel went to bed, me and kai stayed up and had a big talk about kids and abortions and everything. then Al came out and joined us, not long after Joel came out and he started talking too.. so we all had one big group discussion. we stayed up for a couple of hours then took the discussion to bed where we were talking all about sex and shit, it was really wierd. we all went quiet and Al, Erin and joel fell asleep, me and kai were awake for ages, we couldnt sleep. i really didnt get much sleep that night. but it was all good. monday morning me and kai went for a walk, i cooked pancakes for everyone and then we went down to the creek and layed down. we played tennis for a couple of hours before heading home, i slept most of the way home in kai's arms. we got maccas dropped Erin off in the city at her work thingy and went to crown for 2 hours where kai won $90 before picking erin up again and heading back to Al's, i was asleep all the way home from the city too.. we got to Al's and moved all the cars out of the driveway and everyone headed home, great holidays so far. 
all for now bbyyeee"

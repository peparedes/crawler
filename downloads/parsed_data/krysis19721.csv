"event","Its about time I start saying it like it is and get all of this out. 

I hate rejection.  I can't stand the feeling of being rejected and hurt.  It seems everytime I get rejected, I get hurt in some horrific way and Im at the point now where I can't take it anymore.

Maybe that is why every relationship that I have ever held has failed horribly.  Im not sure why, but I can't even ask a girl out.  Every relationship that I have been in, the girl has been the one that has initiated it.  I have never initiated a relationship in my life and chances are, I probably never will.  They get all into me, we go out, they realize that I am in no way the guy that they want me to be and they then find some FUCKED up way to end it with me. Now Im not saying that all of my ex's have fucked me over in the breakup, but a lot of them have and I now horrified of relationships.  I have been hurt so many times in my life that I dont know if I can even have a relationship ever again.  I feel now that even if I do get into one again, Im just going to get hurt in the end like always and do something stupid.  Since last summer, everytime I have had to go through a break up, I have ended up doing a lot more drugs and booze than I should have and on a couple of occasions almost drank myself into Shangri-La. 

Maybe Im doomed to be rejected all of my life.  Maybe I will never find a girl that isnt going to fuck me over that I can actually love and be with.  Maybe Im going to be some fucking 80 year old guy sitting in a nursing home alone and dying. Wait fuck that, if Im 40 and I at least don't have a girlfriend, Im sorry, Im going to kill myself.  I will not fucking die in a fucking nursing home alone.  FUCK THAT.


And thats the other problem.  People would just be like, well go hang out at parties and clubs and shit and meet someone.  I fear public places.  I fear being surrounded by people.  It doesnt even matter where I am.  I can even be at home with homies and still be freaking the fuck out.  I will seriously start scratching into my arm attempting to draw blood while freaking out.  Everybody at the apartment has seen it.  They know what happens and everybody tries to help me whatever way possible.  I thank you guys deeply.  You truly show me what family is about and I love you guys for that. 

As I sit here writing this at 4 in the morning, I can't help but figure out what my next move with my disease is from here.  I am almost at the point of breaking down again and I dont want to see the effects that its going to take on me this time.  It almost killed me last time but Im not going to let it kill me this time.  Im going to fight this all the way through.  All I can say is when you are around me watch me.  Make sure, Im not freaking out, check my  upper right arm for scars (thats where if Im going to cut I will), and if you notice me just disappearing from anywhere (especially a social event) come and find me, im probably doing something that I shouldn't be doing.

I think I have ranted enough.

Peace,
-K"

I'm doing okay in Eugene.  Been smoking a lot and just relaxing.  I hope that everything is going good even though Im having deep fears that everything is not okay and Im probably going to have some sort of psychotic snap when I get back to Portland.  I dont want to come back to Portland and have to repair the extent of damage that I had to repair the last time I left town.

"event","what did this weekend occur, the undying urge to slice into my wrist or better yet any part of my body was extremely tempting.  I honestly dont know what was the basis as to why i needed fascination from cutting.  

But enough of me being suicidal, heres what i did all fucking weekend...

Thursday
Killed a fifth of rum with Niks and got crunk

Friday 
Partied at Doxx's and then got home fucked up and drank even more. 

Saturday
Wrote a bunch of poetry while being depressed only to be at home tanked when Niks got there tanked, tanked, and more tanked around 2 in the morning.  Then we got more tanked. (Lol Tanked). And mom and her cousin got home with green and we crunked out with that. 
 
Sunday
Smoked a whole lot of herb and ended up making fun of everybody because they passed out early.  Niks came over around 230 in the morning and we chilled until 530 in the morning.


Well, i am heading out Eugene tomorrow so I will see all of you when I get home.  

Love y'all family.

ps: you all better be there when i get to the greyhound station or I will be a sad krysis. :("

Its seeming like Im staying up for a minimum of 30 hours about once a week.  Oh well, its going to be definitely longer today since Im going to buy a fifth of Smirnoff and a fifth of Rum, and to top that off, my home girl is bringing over a fresh bottle of cuervo tonight and to add final salt to the wound, there is half a bottle of Southern Comfort left.  

Maybe the booze will put me to sleep tonight.

I apologize that I went off ealier about all that shit.  It is just that now that I have finally started getting my life back into gear that I have to still have all those reminders of the bullshit that I got myself out of.  I was just tired of thiking about all of that and to get four emails from people needing me to babysit them just pushed me over the edge and I needed to openly vent.  

I want all y'all to know that you are all my family that I will love y'all forever.  Without all y'all, I would have probably slipped back into tweeking and would have either been in jail or dead. Just know that if you ever need me, I will be there for ya ready to do whatever I need to do.

"event","Its seriously been a while, but Im still alive.  I have just been busier than hell as of late.  I am currently working on promoting the Pavement Joint label while I work on the eight (thats right, EIGHT) groups that I am working with. Its not all vocals for me on all of them (about four of them), its all good though.  The two main groups that I am working on now are Penstroke Takeover which I am rapping with that psycho ninjette that everybody knows and love, Mazkeraid and Kannibus Cannibalists which features my homeboy for life Mok, and my crazy as all hell homegirls, Pfresh and Scarlette.  Penstroke Takeover (PSTO) is going to be focused more towards how fucked up society is and the ways that we need to change it and Kannibus Cannibalists (K.C.) will be the more acid rap focused album.  Im not going to go over all of the other groups right now because they are all on the developmental phase and I dont want to elaborate on them.  I have had a lot of people tell me that I am totally ambitious with my music and I seriously am.  I dedicate a lot of time towards my music and I intend strive to make my music a reality so that the whole fucking world knows how fucked up Portland really is.

Give all y'all a heads up, Im probably going to be heading down to Eugene sometime next week to go and visit my best home girl for life doxx so that we can get it crunk up in the 541 for a week.  I just need to sell my bike and Im on my way outta Portland for a while.  I just need to get out of Portland for a little while because Im at the point where I want to kill people and its time for K to take a break out of Portland for a little while.  

Well that is all for now.  Im off to get crunk and party tonight.  

peace out y'all and to my family, I love all ya and cant wait until I can party wit all y'all again."

First off, Im going to get a job.  I know that I have been saying this for a long time but it is time.  I am tired of having to have Stray sleep outside with me when she comes to see me so I need to get one asap.  Second, downtown is burnt to me.  I cant stand a lot of the people down there anymore, I pretty go there to eat and then leave. the shitty part is that I have to see most of these people when I eat.  Finally, the Record.  It has been plagued with delays, accidents and problems so now, it fucking on.  I am going to talk with the M.O.K. and Mazkeraid ASAP and see what they want to do in terms of working on the record.  What I want is at least once a week all three of us get together and start writing the record.  If we have to do it somewhere where we wont be distracted then so be it.  All I know now is that I have a ton of ammo that I want to use in music and that it is going to be sick.  

And Stray, my love, Krysis is on a rampage now and when you get back from Cali, Im going to have a job and most likely be inside somewhere.  Much Clown Love for eternity."

******
How DARE you say that about Matt. I cant belive you.

I WASTED a year plus of my life on you. I gave you everything.

I hope your happy, I really really do.

Because I hate you now. HATE.

And I heard from a downtowner that your spreading shit about me. 

And to think, that when I drove by the Library yesterday I fucking saw you and I missed you! I MISSED YOU!

I fucking cried. Im such a stupid bitch. You know I thought you actually cared. But you dont, your gonna turn on me and call my boyfriend a rapist. 

I hope you and stray are really happy together.
****

Now, lets clarify a few things that she's putting out here in her rant against me.  Number 1, I never called her boyfriend a rapist, sure, he has taken advantage of some chicks but I dont think I ever put the word rape in there.  Number 2, The supposed downtowner that said I was spreading about her is actually my street brother and I found out that she tried to spread more shit about me and Juggalos in general when he told her to kick rocks and to get the fuck off the block.  

Oh yeah, KITTY!!! since apparently you are still reading my journal, get one thing through your head DERRICK AND CHRIS STOLE SCOTTIE'S CAR!!! ZAK HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT!!!  DERRICK EVEN CALLED SCOTTIE AND ADMITTED TO HIM THAT HE AND CHRIS STOLE IT!!! STOP BEING SO FUCKING NAIVE AND FORGIVING!!! 

and your not a stupid bitch! And you want to hear shit, I on the 9 going out to se a few days ago and I saw you heading back from the park, it made me so sad to see you.  

Oh yeah, we might have the same mother but as far as I am concerned Kitty, You are not my sister, never was my sister and never will be my sister.

Whatever I have said my peace for now."

"event","Last night, I was scared both shitless and then filled with happiness when I  finally talked to my little sister paradoxx yesterday.  She had left me a offline message that said she was in eugene so i was thinking she was gone for good.  i immediately talked to her online and she said that she will be back on the first!!  Another thing I found out was that paradoxx is taking stray and my side in the whole kitty drama bullshit.  I feel even worse because Kitty has been totally brainwashed by his lies.  Two examples, first, Matt told Kitty that while stray was up there that she just sucked him off, when in reality Matt took advantage of Stray when she was totally dopesick as all hell and ended up FUCKING HER!!! The second piece of info was that matt offered stray heroin if she had a threesome with him and the dealer.  Thats right, I know everything that happened when stray was up there and it doesnt make matt the innocent angel that he wants to be in front of kitty.  If anyone is wondering why Im putting this in my journal, I am hoping that Kitty will see this and realize that Matt is a lying bitch and he deserves no respect or remorse.  But of course shes brainwashed by him and I quite honestly dont ever think that she will  realize this."

And what is the response I get, alienation and disownment from those I love and care for.  Thats fine, I can accept it, I guess that if they can't accept the fact that I can be happy for once then I guess they really arent friends of mine.  Oh well, I will worry about things later because all this drama is starting to get to me and Im not going to do anything about it.

whether or not I ran with a fucking knife
screaming fuck off and being real manic
I ended up being in a fucking panic
It came down to life wasnt worth shit
So I decided to take the biggest fucking hit
off the side of a bridge to end the pain
I slowly walked to Morrison in the fucking rain
Looking off the edge like Im ready to die
I finally broke down on the bridge to cry
thats when I called Syren she came and got me
then sat me down to make sure I wasnt crazy
that was when I needed 24 hour care
it was the hospital that I didnt dare
but I was forced to go and it didnt help a bit
Im still crazy and I dont give a shit

I wrote the first part of this when I was in the mental ward and I wrote the second part just now.  Dont take this seriously, Im not suicidal anymore.  I have got the greatest street family in the world and there is no reason for me to kill myself."

One Thing in life killa always needs
is smoking up pounds and pounds of weed
Moving at the speed of super retarded sonic
I spend my money only on Super Hippie Kronik
smoking bowl after mothafucking bowl
I smoke everyday to get on a fucking roll
showing the world why I am a nyghtmare
its better high to when Im doing a scare
naming your pipe is always real smart
it makes it your own personal piece of art
always fun to be high as a kite
especially when you get the power of flight
being stoned makes me feel I can fly
I purposedly made this sound cuz im really high
the paranoia that people always fear
is nothing more that smoke and mirror

Chorus ( 2 times)

How many bowls in your 20 sack
how many times did I get a scooby snack
whats it like to be able to fly
You know when you get fucking high

Dr. Kronik's Verse

Chorus ( 2 times)

How many bowls in your 20 sack
how many times did I get a scooby snack
whats it like to be able to fly
You know when you get fucking high

Mazkeraid

Mary jane has been my friend as long as I remember
it will be six years this september
since I first hit the kronik green dream
my life has since been peaches and cream
even though I do enjoy to fucking drink
it impairs my fucking ability ability to think
telling the world that weed is okay
and that all should smoke every single day
Medical profession says that its fucking wrong
yet real doctors will perscribe the bong 
for they know that it helps with the pain
and that people have plenty to gain
wars would be ended and companies wouldnt fleece
and in the end there would be world peace
The government needs to cut their fucking shit
and let go and fucking legalize it

Chorus ( 2 times)

How many bowls in your 20 sack
how many times did I get a scooby snack
whats it like to be able to fly
You know when you get fucking high 


So there you go, you have one song to look at.  Good Times"

"event","All I ever wanted was a chance to shine
I wasn't askin for much I just wanted mine
I don't even have a clue what went wrong
I just knew I wouldn't let the shit slide for long
Tell me somethin who the fuck you laughin at
What the fuck u thinkin don't you see this bat
Tell me what the hell is stoppin me from crackin your dome
From smackin your dome till it ooze like foam
All I ever wanted was an eye for an eye
Ima taste your ?soul? when I swallow it live
Turn around wasn't lookin diggin in your locker
as soon as you Looked up whack that's when I gotcha
Crack smack it rack it again
Kept thumpin and skull til it finally caved in
It looked like spaghetti in a broken bowl
I guess I lost control it's all I ever wanted though 

-Violent J 
""All I ever Wanted""

Everybody that has ever met me has said that this Violent J's part reminded them of me.  As of late, I havent lived up to the full potential that Krysis Killa is.  It is time for Krysis Killa to resurect and become the psycho everybody loves again."

"event","so I did absolutely nothing today.  The only thing that I did that is even remotely interesting is that my parents put their house up for sale today.  I dont know where they are moving to after that, they wont tell me.  all I know is that we are moving soon.  I did go to the mall this afternoon where I bought a pair of all black Cons which are the shit.  Oh well, I just blew a perfectly good day off."

"event","So I have made up my mind on whether I am going edge or not.  The decision that I made is that it is time for me to edge.  I have had my last fast food meal (Wendy's if anyone cares) forever.  This may not neccessarily be part of sXe but it is a lot better for me if I quit eating at those places altogether.  Im starting to get fatter anyways.  At least Im getting a bike real soon.  

So there is one main reason that I decided to go edge.  First, I am going back to school in less than two weeks and I cant spend as much time as I was smoking and doing all the regular things that I did.  I am going to have focus on college and finish my degree before I can party again because honestly, I dont want to fucking work at Coffee People the rest of my life. 

Now dont get me wrong, I will every very rarely so often slip and enjoy a hit or get drunk.  But that will be a whiles away.  I need to get myself cleaned up so I can get a new job because Im real sick of Coffee People and I need to pass a drug test."

"event","So today is really a day that I am going to consider whether or not I am going to go edge.  I have heard both sides of the spectrum and I think that it is now up to me to decide on whether or not I am going to go edge.  I know that whatever I do, I will have total support from my friends and family.  I guess all I have to do now is what and see how long it takes me to start smoking again. 

I have to work today which doesnt help me a whole lot. Fuck it, I need the money.  I guess I am going to work whether I like it or not."

"event","so today, Im hanging out with tori, dj, nicole, and sam and trying not smoke.  Becoming straight edge is the hardest thing to do so far for me.  So I have decided to make this weekend my last weekend of drinking and smoking cigarettes.  I will surely miss them but I cant just change things on a dime.  Oh well, cest le vie."

"event","so I have decided that I am going to start putting more information in here because Im krysis and thats what I need to do.  I know my journal isnt spectacular right now, but in time, I think that it will be.  Well lets see big news since I last posted...

I ended up in a mental hospital, big surprise for a week and a half.  As soon as I got out, I was homeless for about four days until I was able to cave my parents and I moved back in with them.  I also got a job working for a local coffee shop where I sling coffee all damn day. 

I have found that smoking weed doesnt do it for me anymore.  Everytime I smoke I get paralyzing anxiety attacks.  I have decided that I am no longer going to smoke weed and go straight edge.  Yes, Krysis Killa is now straight edge.  I dont care if other people do it around me or if people I am hanging out with are stoned, I just cant do it anymore because it makes me want to hurt myself when I do it.  And besides, being straight edge for me might be a good thing.

Well that is all for this update, I will probably jump back online later tomorrow and announce what I did at work today.  Most likely absolutely nothing!!!

-Peace"

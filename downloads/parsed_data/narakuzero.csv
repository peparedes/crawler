"event","I'm tired as fuck so this story might be a little hard to follow. Bear with me.

Last night I was watching TV when I hear coughing and footsteps. I open the door and my 4 year old brother (half-brother) is in the hallway. He's walked out of his room and he looks like he's about to cry.

He wheezes a lot, and I ask what's wrong, but he won't reply. I sit him on the couch next to me and he still wan't talk. My mother comes racing in due to the noise and starts going fucking crazy saying he can't breath. She took him to her room to get him some ventalin or some shit, even though he's not asthmatic. I follow them and she starts yelling for her boyfriend to ring an ambulance.

At this point my brother starts freaking the fuck out and saying he's scared in between big, wheezy gasps and coughs. I grab onto him and calm him down as my mother runs off to the phone. He starts calming down a bit as I was trying to act relaxed so he wouldn't panic.

I explained to him that an ambulance was coming and he'd probably have to wear a mask so he could breath. He didn't really want to go to anybody else because they were all going crazy. I changed the subject and started talking about other shit to him so he wouldn't get scared. The ambulance show up within about 3 or 4 mins and come in.

They're VERY calm and reassuring and put the mask on him, ask him his favourite TV show, etc.

They put him in one of those beds and wheel him to the ambulance and my mum goes with.

This is all at about 11:00 PM at night. My grandmother rings around 11:45 and I explain shit to her. She said she spoke to my mother and it's either croak (sp?) or an asthma attack.

Anyway, within a few hours he's better but as it's late they kept him until about lunch time the next day.

He's all chirpy and happy again now.


Basically, that was my weekend. It happened totally out of the blue and scared the fucking hell out of me, but I tried my best to calm the situation as I tend to do.

Everything has worked out though, so that's all that matters."

"event","Eric Bischoff opens up RAW backstage, talking to good ol' JR. Main event is now a No-Holds-Barred match.... Why is JR wrestling? It's not even Oklahoma.

Edge vs. Chris Benoit is up... CLUSTERFUCK! The brawl backstage sucked and was anything but hardcore. But... LAST MAN STANDING MATCH AT BACKLASH! Fucking sweet. I almost ordered the PPV for that, but Batista main eventing made me change my mind.

The lovely Trish Stratus makes her way to the ring. She's class. She tried to save Lita and make it seem like all the derogatory chants weren't directed at her, but she didn't fool anybody. My buddy Chris apparently started the chants, hahahhahaha. 'We Want Matt!' 'You Screwed Matt!' Fucking awesome. Viscera comes out (?!?!?!?) and saves the day to a big 'Let's Go Mabel!' chant.. Haha I love this crowd. Kane jobs out to a jobber.. Hmmmmm...

Viscera tries to get it on with Trishy backstage, but my widdle angel refuses. Viscera is like the new Sexual Chocolate. What a playa! As frightening as this was, I wonder where they're going with it.. I really REALLY wanted Christian to come out and say 'Back off Vis!' and reunite my favourite duo ever, but no dice.

The Heart Throbs debut against Regal and Tajiri. The Heart Throbs were MUCH better against Hurricane and Rosey on Heat a few months back... This match sucked. Heart Throbs weren't even as funny as they were on Heat. I guess it was a first match jitters thing. At least it's a new team.. A shame they did the JOB! though. MNM over on SD! are WAAAAAY better.

Backstage JR is talking to ref. Batista isn't there.. yada yada. Fuck Batista.

Hassan cuts a promo on HBK. Same old..

Hassan vs. HBK sucked like there other match. These guys have no chemistry at all. Hassan is DQed, Hogan saves the day to a big ass pop.. Celebration ensues. HBK doing Hogan poses = Ratings.

Shelton Benjamin vs. Simon Dean. Match was rather dull, but Y2J's song was pretty funny. I expected more out of Shelton.. Y2J should go to SD! as a heel and feud with Cena for the belt. He needs to play up that he's a rock star more often, as this was funny shit.

HERE COMES CAPTAIN CHARISMA!!! The Christian Coalition is out in full force at MSG, baby!! Vinnie Mac comes out an announces another draft lottery! Sweeeeeet! Funny moment, Christian rocks my world. ""I'm going to kick Marky Marks ass and take his title!"" HELL YEAH!

Christian vs. Batista booked for next week in England.. I pray to God Captain Charisma doesn't get the Orton treatment and get squashed. I'd wet myself if he won somehow. Here's hoping..

Triple H is backstage, yada yada, they show a video with his drowning pool music. Cool.

JR vs. Triple H.. No DQ.... NEXT!

This match was a disgrace. Who the fuck did Jim Ross piss off? I think Triple H even helped JR blade. This was disgusting and uncalled for. JR isn't a fucking wrestler, why do this shit to him? Whoever booked this bullshit needs to be fucking fired. Batista runs out, predictably, and owns Triple H. JR wins!!!! Hurray!

In closing.. I hate Batista and wish him nothing but personal pain, suffering, and trauma."

"event","I don't like school. I don't like the people in my new classes. School is shitty and I don't like it, basically. It's not like I get bullied or anything, I just don't enjoy it at all.

RAW was good last night, best one in recent weeks. So now it's my random review time! Hurray!

6-Man tag opener was cool and Benoit did a sick German Suplex on Tomko. He fucking tossed him really far, right on his head. Benoit, HBK and Y2J won when Michaels superkicked Tomko and Benoit gave him a school boy for the 1, 2, 3. Good match. I like how Edge and Christian are working together recently.

Next.. J.R DAY CEREMONY! Hurray for J.R! Triple H interrupts, blah blah blah. It was actually pretty funny. ""That's like crap telling puke it smells good!"" was funny. Backstage segment where Flair and Triple H were ranting and raving about it to Batista was hilarious.

Backstage, Regal asks Bischoff for a Royal Rumble spot. Bischoff denies him one, even though Regal says he's willing to take a qualifying match. Bischoff says Regal hasn't been loyal to him and he'll give the spot to someone who has... THE COACH! Oh no! Oh well, at least it's better than Ernest Miller from last year.

La Resistance are asking Bischoff for spots when Batista comes in. Blah blah blah, handicap match later on, blah blah blah Batista will squash them to get into the Rumble. Grenier says they 'go both ways' but Conway makes the save and says ""Yeah! We wrestle tag-team and singles!"" haha

OH NO! It's Jonathan Coachman! What's that fucker coming out for? Coach informs Tajiri the next match will be an over-the-top rope match with the winner getting in the Rumble... But who is Tajiri's opponent!? Bah GAWD! It's Viscera! The fat nigger squashes Tajiri's ass and chucks him out of the ring in like 20 seconds to win. Yawn.. At least Viscera's fat ass got misted. I guess he'll be the token fat dude in the Rumble that everybody gangs up on. Ho hum.

Next Maria asks Tajiri how he feels about not being in the Rumble. Who the fuck's idea was it to get this chick? She's hot, that's for sure, but she's SO stupid. She botched her lines AGAIN and paused, stalled and confused herself. Finally, Regal comes in to save the day, hits on Maria and tells Tajiri he has an idea to get back at Bischoff.. The two leave together. Yay! Regal and Tajiri have been reunited! I hope they win the tag titles soon.

Batista VS La Resistance, Royal Rumble qualifier.. Batista destroys the tag champs, ho hum. Dave is in the Rumble. Ho hum. Dave better not win it. Ho hum. Batista then anally rapes Rob Conway with a flag pole.. Hmmm... Triple H trying to get it on with Stacy, peering up that bimbos skirt, now this. Gee. I wonder what the theme of this RAW is?

Muhammad Hassan VS Val Venis, Royal Rumble qualifier. Val bald = Not Val. Khosrow Daivari is a pain in the ass. He's like an arabic Bill Alphonso.. Fucking jackass. Val is a great wrestler and needs a new gimmick. Val does an awesome Blue Thunder Bomb amongst other unique moves during the match but loses to Muhammad in what was largely a squash. Hassan says he'll win the Rumble this Sunday!! Oh my! Nobody believes him at all. I wouldn't be surprised to see him last 20+ minutes though, but I hope not.

Maven comes out and gets a second chance at the rumble, blah blah blah blah Kane and Snitsky come out... CRIPPLE FIGHT ENSUES!!!! This was stupid, but I laughed at how stupid Snitsky looked selling it all. I was going for Maven but it was not to be, bah gawd. CHOKE SLAM! Kane wins. Heel Maven = Awesome. Him, Rhyno, Tajiri, Regal and Chavo deserved spots in the Royal Rumble. Oh well.


Austin press conference was shown. I don't give a shit. Either get on RAW or don't waste my time.

Edge bitches and moans, missed two WrestleManias with a broken neck, gonna fuck up HBK and win the Rumble. Got it.

Randy VS Flair
STOP. HAVING. RANDY. VS. EVOLUTION. MAIN. FUCKING. EVENTS.

Randy wins, Triple H and Batista have some funny interraction on the outside.. Triple H and Flair destroy Randy's knee but bah gawd he fights them off and poses with the title!!

CAN RANDY WIN THE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE THIS SUNDAY!?!?!?! 

SPOILERS!! KICKWHAMPEDIGREE123OMFG NO!! TRIPLE H

On the bright side, I'm taking Monday off to watch the Royal Rumble which will be awesome. Cena and Batista suck balls, go HBK!

I also found at WWE Smackdown! is having a house show on April 8th. My birthday and WrestleMania are both on April 3rd, so I'm going to see if I can get someone to take me for my birthday. Last year's house show was awesome, and I hope this one will be as good. I wish it was RAW because I already saw Smackdown! last year, but oh well. I hope a roster draft occurs before it, but I doubt it. Maybe Lesnar will be back in time for it?"

"event","Hardcore Holly is a motherfucker. This year he's injured Matt Morgan, Matt Cappotelli and Carlito (who was US Champ at the time and in a major storyline which he completely fucked) and probably more... Now at a House Show he was in a hardcore match with Rene Dupree and Kenzo Suzuki, with his partner as Charlie Haas. Holly gave him an extremely stiff chair shot, and some legitimate, big right hands. Fans in the arena claim Dupree had swelling and other indications of injury.

I've heard two stories... One was 'The reason it all happened was Dupree borrowed Holly's rental car a while back and got a ticket while driving it. Holly had to pay the fine and had to take time to fly to the city it happened it to settle whatever it was in court.' and the other claimed Dupree hit Haas pretty hard with a bin so Holly was sticking up for him. Both are no excuse. Haas is 33 years old and can stick up for himself. Shit like cars isn't supposed to go into the ring. Bret and HBK hate each other but they didn't fucking slaughter one another, likewise with Hogan and Savage.

In closing, why the fuck did Rico, Johnny Stamboli and Gail Kim get fired when this motherfucker still has a job? He wants to shoot fight he should go to UFC so Ken Shamrock can break his face.

*EDIT* In happier news, I saw my chicky-babe Trish Stratus on TV for the 2004 Comedy Festival in a short, pointless segment. <3 Trish is swell."

"event","Because I'm bored I think I'll do a review of RAW! Hurray!

Because Team Orton won at Survivor Series each member of that team got to be General Manager for a week. The moment I saw Maven come out in a suit I thought ""Aw fuck..."" but it was surprisingly entertaining.   Maven made some matches. Most were pointless aside from Edge and Christian VS Shelton and Benoit, which was sweet. Christian's comment to Edge about not straining his voice box or he'll be out another 6 months was pretty funny. Why the fuck did they censor Edge giving the middle finger? It's not like Austin didn't do that like.... 20 times a night.

New tag champs with Regal and Eugene... I'd have preffered Rhyno and Tajiri, but as long as it's not those stupid La Resistance guys. Eugene and Tajiri did loads of cool counters and near-falls. I wish La Resistance were eliminated first, though..

Mainevent was Maven VS Triple H, predictably. Earlier in the night Triple H had tried to bribe Maven to join Evolution which pissed off Batista (I love where they're going with him. Soon he's just going to blow up in Triple H's face and tell him to fuck off.) I was actually cheering for Triple H as I was so scared Maven might win with all the interference. Wrestling-wise the match was shitty, but it ended up going well storyline-wise, and Y2J was pretty funny. Triple H retained and the world was a better place because of it.

Hopefully next week it'll be RAW Is Jericho! Woo!"

"event","I got back from a Smackdown House Show yesterday. Great show, and I'm going to copy/paste what happened.. (With David's comments edited out because he smells bad. </3)

NarakuZero: the matches were (I'll attempt to do it in order..)
NarakuZero: Funaki beat Rene Dupree via rollup when Dupree was dancing. Dupree got a big erection which was pretty disturbing, and caused my Dupree cheering to immediately stop.
NarakuZero: Spike beat Rey with interference from Dudleyz
NarakuZero: Spike did a body scissors for like 2 minutes
NarakuZero: Rey got out
NarakuZero: they ran around about 20 seconds
NarakuZero: then Spike got the body scissors on AGAIN..
NarakuZero: Torrie beat Dawn Marie
NarakuZero: Heidenreich beat Billy Gunn after Heyman gave a promo, then Gunn did a short one saying some shit, then the classic ""I'VE GOT TWO WORDS FOR YA..."" and everyone but the little kids yelled SUCK IT
NarakuZero: Eddie beat Angle. A little slow to start off, but good.
NarakuZero: Then there was the intermission
NarakuZero: Then..
NarakuZero: London and Kidman VS Dudleyz. Probably best match of the night, loads of action and high flying. I loved it, even Bubba went to the top rope.
NarakuZero: Also, just after their music stopped I yelled out ""KIDMAN KILLED CHAVO"" because he knocked him out on Smackdown a few days ago. Hahaha.
NarakuZero: Someone had a Paul London sign, but Bubba ripped it up
NarakuZero: Kidman got small Billy chants. People cheered for London, but no chants. Probably because nobody knew his name. It had a pretty fun ending that almost made up for Rey's unusually bad match.
NarakuZero: Spike came out and tripped up Kidman
NarakuZero: London chased him around the ring and knocked him out.
NarakuZero: London/Kidman won with some move I forget.
NarakuZero: They brawled after the match, and Rey run out and got a 619 on someone.. I think Spike.
NarakuZero: so, the Dudleyz got beat up a lot.
NarakuZero: RVD beat Kenzo. It's fun as fuck to yell 'ROB. VAN. DAM."" when he does the thumb thing.
NarakuZero: Cena and Haas beat Luther and Booker
NarakuZero: The people behind me were funny for this match. One had no idea who Haas was and kept suddenly screaming 'GO LITTLE HAASY' and shit like that.
NarakuZero: I booed Cena but nobody heard amongst the huge cheers. ;.;
NarakuZero: The people behind me booed as well, though.
NarakuZero: Haas got pops for being with Cena, and because he was supposed to
NarakuZero: Booker got pops when he came out, big pops for the fire thing at the start, and boos for the match
NarakuZero: And then the mainevent..
NarakuZero: Bradshaw VS Undertaker
NarakuZero: Taker took like 2 mins to get the ring, and it was fucking great.
NarakuZero: Match was pretty cool. Better then the one at SummerSlam because it had a better reaction, mainly.
NarakuZero: Ref got knocked out
NarakuZero: another ref ran it
NarakuZero: Taker knocked him out
NarakuZero: other ref woke up and disqualified Bradshaw. I don't know why.. Dupree interfered earlier, so I guess that's it.
NarakuZero: Undertaker won via DQ
NarakuZero: He beat down Undertaker
NarakuZero: Dupree ran it
NarakuZero: beat down Dupree
NarakuZero: Haas ran it to make the un-needed save
NarakuZero: Bubba and D-Von ran down and took out Haas, who had a chair
NarakuZero: they gave Taker a 3D
NarakuZero: Then did some taunt, then Taker beat them both down
NarakuZero: then Undertaker took about 2 minutes to leave with his music playing and shit

Biggest pops of the night..
1. Undertaker.
2. Cena
3. Eddie.

Biggest heel heat..
1. JBL
2. Uh.. Probably Angle, but he gots lots of cheers as well.
3. Everyone else. Crowd was hot.

Best matches..
1. Bradshaw VS Taker, mainly for atmosphere but it was pretty good as well.
2. London and Kidman VS Dudley Boyz. Best actual wrestling match with no fucking around. Lots of high flying by everyone, even Bubba went to the top rope. Fast paced and fun to watch live.
3. Angle VS Eddie. Good match, but started off a little slow."

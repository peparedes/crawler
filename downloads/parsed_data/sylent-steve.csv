just updating to show u guys im still alive. 


nothing really left to talk about really.  Schools been going alright...chilling with more people....and the girl situation is looking up i suppose.  so things are pretty cool.


..but there's still the party animal in me wishing i was at a keggar.



mmm...keg. yeah, i definitely need to find a wedding to go to..(haha)





anyway, i think after this post, i going back to freinds only.  Rick's recent switch made me wanna do it...acutally, ill make a post immediate after this one displaying a clever freinds only picture.


and fuck the internet...i just saw something i definitely didnt want to...and i really wish i hadnt seen it...whatever...i ll get over it...just need some SLEEP.

"event","so i just came back from the gym.



i guess it wasn't as bad as i thought.  i originally thought i wasnt even gonna be able to lift 10 pounds.


i did take protein before i left though, so it prolly helped what little strength i  originally had.


i'd say on average, with every exercize, i lost about 20 pounds...meaning from what i was able to do, i can now only do 20 pounds lighter than that.  running is still ok, but i attribute that to the wieght loss, and enurance overall suffered the most.  given i am extremely tired and sleep deprived though, it was pretty decent i suppose.



guess i got a long way to go before im back where i was.

You're still bent out of shape about the change from ""The Indians"" to ""The Riverhawks"".


The Annual St. Ann's / St. Augustine's Fair is a MUST in your summer schedule...

You've heard the whole Sleepy Hollow/Ichabod Crane story at least a million times.


Either Mega Taxi, Camps Taxi, or Ecua Taxi is saved in your cell phone.

You give someone a pat on the back and wish them good luck when they say that they're moving to Spring St.


You verbally bash the Annual Bonfire but find yourself there totally smashed that Friday night.


You realize that South Highland, North Highland, they're both the same damn road.


You know when someone's talking about Beetlejuice, they're not talking about the cartoon...

Someone casually mentions something containing the numbers ""5-0"" or sounding like ""popo"" (like ""cocoa"") and you jump, getting a bit

You're furious they took out the middle steps at OHS.


You spend at least one of your off periods at OHS at The Wall (R.I.P. The Steps).

we gotta see how things play out in the next couple of weeks..see whats gonna happen.


The only thing thats been holding me together lately is work and comedy.  Been watching alot of stand-up and SNL stuff.  Really think thats one of the best jobs ever.  


And this Lipo 6 shit is really awsome.  Just took 2 three seconds ago.  Gives you alot of energy, it's great.  Sure its the caffiene, but hey, im not complaining.  i acutally stay awake most of the day, and that slump that im sorta still in has been going awy.  im more like my awake, witty self most of he time, and i like it. wanna get to 200 - 190 range.  we'll see how long it takes to get there....freinds dad owns a gym around my house, so after it closes were gonna go work out...a whole gym to myself..that shit is sick.  hopefully it goes down...cause he also has like a million differnt protein shakes...yum yum yum



and as for new car.....dont know if its gonna happen so soon...dad's going back to ecuador...for good i think...and im pretty much left to get my own things once again.


and brother is pre-occupied with his little g/f, so it's kinda nice to have some quiet once in awhile.



whatever duuuude....just waiting for next year i suppose...

its been..well...the same shit basically.  it felt much longer than i week, and i only find the time now to acutally update this damn thing.


classes are gonna be crazy.  think im taking 5 or six.  doesnt matter.  i now have to see if circuit city is worth my time, and whether it'll even be possible.  the only way to get outta this town is to study my ass off.  no b's whatsoever, only A's.  and i dunno if i can do that if im working at the city.  we'll see how that goes though.  yay for like, 3 classes in one day!


NY also taught me acouple of things about myself, and other people.  People, for the most part, haven't changed.  Czank said your first break it never seems like anything changes.  I wish things did change though.  not all things, like most of my freinds, you guys are still as awsome as i left, and hopefully u guys will continue the legacy if u decide to come down for spring break.  daytona? South beach? fuck, universal, disney, bush gardens...only a hour or 2 away.  just think about it.


anyway, yeah, about changes.  somethings DO NOT change.  and it's ashame they dont.  thats all i have to, and need to say.




missed out on alot of things up there in NY, mainly the food.  I wanted chinese food real bad up there, pizza too, but wasn't able to, or when i was, i had already ate.  bah...next time, next time.



wedding crashers though, omg.  bought it the other day.  holy shit.  i <3 that movie so much.  gotta cut down on watching it though, its just overkill.

it's cause i didnt get enough sleep last night.  Prolly one of the most un-christmas' i've ever had.  I didnt participate in SHIT.  I woke up at 6 that morning, and from 7:45 to 6:20 i was at circuit city....not really working mind you...mostly conversing with other co-workers, but still.  the night before i had slept without a shirt, thinking that it was ok to start to again cause i was feeling better. 


MISTAKE.



i felt worse that morning, and during work, it was worse.  You see, that morning it was fucking freezing, so they turned on the heat....but for some reason they didnt turn it off, so it was fucking hot as hell all day..and heat and me being sick dont really mix.  So though i didnt really work alot, i did, nonetheless, have a shitty time due to my stuffy/runny nose.



i got home at 7 and basically crashed....or tried too.  You see, my house is cheap, and noise travels to like, every room.  and on christmas eve at a hispanic house hold, 7 is when there at there LOUDEST.  anyways, long story short, didnt get to sleep till about 4.  Woke up today at 10.  been up ever since.



I'm about 95 percent done packing right now.  Just last minute things and what not, and i should be done with it all.  the weather up there isnt suppose to be that bad, so im not bringing any heavy sweaters and what not, just light stuff.

"event","ok, well, im posting lyrics...something i hardly ever do anymore, but it's cause of this song, that really made me appreciate songwriting in general.



on the radio the dj deticated this song to a fallen marine in iraq.  to me though, it puts most guys emotions towards women in perspective. or atleast how there thinking'  


we dont think about sex all the time.





..ok, thats true.




My life is brilliant.
My love is pure.
I saw an angel.
Of that I'm sure.
She smiled at me on the subway.
She was with another man.
But I won't lose no sleep on that,
'Cause I've got a plan.

You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
You're beautiful, it's true.
I saw you face in a crowded place,
And I don't know what to do,
'Cause I'll never be with you.

Yeah, she caught my eye,
As we walked on by.
She could see from my face that I was,
Fucking high,
And I don't think that I'll see her again,
But we shared a moment that will last till the end.

You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
You're beautiful, it's true.
I saw you face in a crowded place,
And I don't know what to do,
'Cause I'll never be with you.
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
You're beautiful, it's true.
There must be an angel with a smile on her face,
When she thought up that I should be with you.
But it's time to face the truth,
I will never be with you.






yeah...anyways, got some shit to do for school, but suprisingly not that much.  Then work from 5 to 10:30...prolly wont get home till 11 again though...

Laura's house, as far as i know, is still going on.  But right now, theres other stuff going on in the works.  To early to mention, but if it happens, it'll be to good to be true.  More info as i comes, so just be patient.

Absinthe cannot happen btw...to expensive for the most part.  Maybe during the summer youngsters.  but with all the saved money, we can get many a-more stuff.  so w00t for that.

"event","haven't updated in awhile.  



the entry before this was in answer to the stress i was going to, and was already feeling.



Thursday night (t-day) pulled a all nighter cause i couldnt go to sleep early.  needed to be up by 2, to get ready by 3, to leave by 3:30, and to get to work by 4.  it was crazy.  starbucks coffee once again saved the day, but it was still hectic.  I screwed up with some shit, but for the most part, it was alright.  i was there since like, 3:45, and stayed till around 10.  So for the most part, a 20 hour day.  Had to wake up the next morning too, at 7, to go to work yet again.  this time, 7 hours.  Which left sunday to drop off rob and sabby back home.



i woke up, and pretty much said lets go. kinda being a ass, but i was cranky i guess.  either way, long story short, all together, it took 7 hours to drop them off.  almost 400 miles traveled in one day.  yeah.  the drives were alright, but we were all to tired to really talk much.


Me and sabby tried to sort out the new years dilemna, but we couldnt think of ANYTHING.  If u havent heard, heres the low down.  We want to have a huge new years party.  For those that went, we want carolines again with more people, and less drama.  the solution we were working on was that maybe we can get some hotel rooms, mainly from the hotel in hawthorne, next to the applebee's.  Rooms, for the most part, are cheap...maybe 20 something from everyone would have worked, but that wasnt half of it.  nobody has the money to pay for drinks, AND rooms, and even if they did, the chance of getting caught is high, and nobody wants to get arrested...especally people still on probation.  


jonesy's house was pretty much the beacon on shiny light, but after talking to him, doesnt look like its gonna be at his house.  so our only hope is mike v's place, but thinking about it, even if we DO get it, i dont think it would be all night..and we'd need all night.  The option of asking croton people came up, and i think its a good idea, cause croton would be perfect, but we dont know anyone who's parents are leaving.  even if caroline did have her house free again, i know she wouldn't want the party at her place again, and thats totally cool, and definitely understandable.  The only other people would prolly be denise and them...and CG, but i still have to ask..(unless your reading this..in which case comment if it can be at your place/ know someone).  But for everyone thats reading, if they know somewhere we can go and drink and just chill, tell us.  We'll supply most of the boo's, we just need the local.


and yes...i know we dont have to drink.  We can just have a regular party like the old days.  But i think i speak for most of us when i say drinking is just alot more fun.  so unless we have to, we should plan a drinking party.  regular parties we could have almost anywhere..wouldnt be as big a problem.


anyway, whatever, thats pretty much the update.  i officially switched my major over, so i have to pick out classes for next semester, and get amazing grades, so getting into FSU is that much easier.


and i dont work till thurs, so w00t for that.



...and i'm gonna be back up in NY the 26...so be ready for the return....



MUAHAHAHHA

"event","well, i was gonna commit to not mentioning anything about women here anymore, and for the most part i think i've been pretty good with it.  I was tired of reading old entries about the woes of being single, the happiness in a relationship, and then the inevitable depression of break-ups.


Well, im not gonna bitch about that, so dont worry.  this entry is more for the guys than anyone else.




Ok, so u guys know that chick ive been chasing after?  things are awsome, but i would just like to mention that she's pretty much the Laguna beach kinda chick i've always said i want.  And i say this because of the burberry sunglasses, authentic Louie V. pocket book (she even told me the serial number!?) and spending like, 300 bucks on one sitting at hollister.  Which i guess i would do too, given that they get bigger pant sizes.  Those things hug my ass too much.  im not a village person dammit.


anyway, just thought i should mention that.  It's pretty ironic actually. prolly cant even handle a girl like that.  but shit, if i had moeny like that, i'd buy expensive ass shit too. but definitly feels liek shes WAY outta my league.





...In other news, today in lab i rolled a blunt and put it in the anatomy models mouth.  It was pretty funny.



well, anyway, time to procrastinate, then try and put a dent in a english research paper i havent even started yet, but is do on friday, but we've had like, 2 weeks to work on it.

Mercury may be retrograde, but you're still set to receive nothing but good news. Not only is it finally, officially time to play, but you're also going to be in a fine mood -- romantic, passionate and just a tad eager to take a risk. Does this mean you'll be ruining your reputation as peacemaker/negotiator and cooperator extraordinaire? Not at all. Just add world-class lover to that list. Stand back, everyone; coming through.

I'm a fucking asshole





ive been the biggest dick lately, especially to my family, and i just realized it.  and i know why.  I watch to many musicals...no, just kidding.  im acting like that cause thats my way of showing that i seriously dont want to be here right now, and that i rather be out on my own in some college, studying and shit.  Call me lazy, but i rather not work right now either, even though worl is kinda cool.



i realized this as i was coming home from the mall with my mom in absolute silence.




i was outside, smoking a dutch (which are only 95 cents), making some calls...and then it REALLY set in.



anywayz, theres some thanksgiving drama with getting people over here.  My and rob both have classes the week of, so its gonna be intresting to see what happens.  If worse comes to worse, ill pick everyone up that same day.  but we'll see.  I dont think it has to come to that.



..and i know it's ulrich's b-day party at cg's, so i hope everyone is fucking partying there asses off, cause i know thats what i would be doing if i were there.

i have a question for the ladies, and for guys that think they know..


How shy are girls (atleast u guys) when you like a guy, and he's pretty freidnly toward you. Like, how would you act and stuff?




cause this girl is giving me mixed signals.  or atleast i think she is.  You guys know im soo oblivious to this ""girl liking me"" stuff...i have proof....but anyway, its killing me! i feel all wierd when she talks to someone else....now that CAN'T be right.

yes, i went to miami to party, and it was awsome.  haven't felt that good in a long time.



I would just like to mention that we pretty much saved this chick from being taken advantage of during a party.


We got her back in the dorm, and she threw up and everything...i took off her sheets and shit, and cleaned up and what not.



I'm not looking for a ""thats amazing""....i just wanna get it in here cause it felt pretty good to help someone out like that.

"event","alright, so i had a 8:00 class right.


we had a test though..so i'vre been at home, awake, since like, 8:45.




it just occured to me that i had a LJ, so i decided to type out a entry.


Things have been alright lately...slowly but surely things are looking up...like they always do.  My only complaint is not getting starting sooner with the whole, get a job, start a life down here stuff.  as bitched about earlier, everyone is older than me.  And we all know how hard it is to introduce a new person to ""the group"" anyway. w/e.

anyway, to get further into the ""looking up"" stuff...i start Circuit city orientation is 2 hours, VERY exciting stuff.  i also have to do like...lets see....1500 word draft WITH sources for tomorrow.  now THATS what im talking about!

heh.


also felt pretty good coming out of the test this morning...totally just gave everyone 2 extra points by spotting a repeated question...only like 3 people know about it. *sigh*  its all good though, i know it was cause of ME that there getting it, so whether they acknowledge it or not, im good.


ALSO, turns out the community center around here has a gym...which you dont even know how happy makes me.  Its really cheap too.  But i think its shared with some hospital or something..dont ask, its florida.  Either way though, its cheap, and as long as its the same size, or larger than New york sports Club in Croton, im good.  The only thing im worried about is that they might have TOO many machines.  Dont get me wrong...i like the machines...i use em' every once in a while, but i MUCH rather have a bench, bar, and a shit load of Free wieghts.  Hopefully they have those...or ENOUGh of those..cause a place like this can't stay empty FOREVER.  I love it when theres alot of people at the gym, but hate to wait.  its cool though, cause in croton i'd just go run some more, and give some hot chicks the eye.  you know what im talking about!


No?



I'll show u one day.


gonna suck though to see where im acutally at.  thats always hard to deal with...you know, always in your head, like ""WTF, I KNOW I CAN DO THIS WEIGHT BETTER!! I USED TO LIFT SO MUCH MORE!! ARRRRGGGGGG!!!"".....that goes away with time anyway....plus i think i still have some muscle juice left...alot i think...so that'll help out.



Also still planning on going up for christmas, though now im a little worried.  The schedule i gave Circuit City said that i wanted a break, from the 27th to the 2nd, so i can go up to new york to hang out with everyone..(they'll think its cause of g'ma).  Im just worried that i might not get it, cause the whole purpose of me working there is for holiday help (for now).  So lets see what happens.  IF and when i do get up there, i want to see ALL OF YOU...if it's possible.  ANd i wanna party with all of you too.  Cause i think the last time i partied with MOST of you guys was for new years at carolines....and though that was VERY intresting, it still wasnt everyone.  But im not gonna get my hopes up.  



I seem to have a problem of saying shit way to early, and by the time the acutal event happens, something completetly different ends up happening.  Like the whole college situation.  I think the most recent info i gave was that i wanted to head back up north to Bing for school.  Well, i still want to, but now FSU (Florida State) is at the top of my list.  It makes more sense.  Closer, cheaper, better prestige, and bigger.  Gotta wait till next fall, but let's see what happens.  who knows, FSU might not want me..or have room for me..or SOMETHING.  you know how life is.


Also, if anyone has taken anatomy, can yah fill me in on it? Mom is telling me it's MADDD hard cause of all the memorizing, but i need a second opinion.



i also need another guitar.  Some how playing my first guitar doesnt make me feel like the level im acually at.  I'm still dying fo that Les paul custom supreme. and a nice marshall amp.  yeah, i'd be set for A LONG time after that.


hmm..looking at the time...and the ""dance"" episode of ""made""...i've realized it's taken me 3 minutes to type everything above this sentence.  maybe not 3 minutes..maybe like......10.   but still.


i dunno.  I lost my thunder now.  I could bitch about this chick im trying to get with, but it's not needed.  ill do what i have to do.  and you guys do what u gotta do.



i'll type LATER

"event","ok, so i'd first like to start off by saying i just watched the OC, and only for the shear fact that i think most of those chicks are very hot.  Prolly very close to what i would consider a 10 for me.  Damn, i should have been born THERE.


anyways, things have been pretty good.  The job situation has fixed itself.  Got a job working the technology section at my near by circuit city.  Seasonal wage at first, but that'll change come january.  So im really looking forward to start.  2nd week of november basically.  I was giving some manager chick the eye, which was pretty funny.  i dont even know why i did it...she's not really my type, and prolly alot older...whatever, if i get in good with her, circuit city is gonna be alot more intresting.


School is EHH.  This week wasn't exaclty my best, failing 2 tests (notby a whole lot though) and getting a b+ on another psychology test.  And i got a huge research paper for english coming up.  Thats gonna be extremely annoying.  But so is the plight of an advance english course ;p


I would just like to mention that sideways has just started on HBO, and this is my second time watching it.  And i have to say, i really really really like this film.  The character of miles portraits a man going through denile and self pity perfectly.  He's still not over his divorce.  and i just have to say, i think almost every guy can relate to it. you guys know what im talking about.  whatever, just watch it.  you'll get it.  plus its pretty damn funny too.  and it'll want to make you become a wine taster.  Trust me.

                         You need to get laid.

               Miles shrugs off the comment.

                                     JACK
                         It'd be the best thing for you. You 
                         know what? I'm going to get you laid 
                         this week. That's going to be my 
                         best man gift to you. I'm not going 
                         to give you a pen knife or a gift 
                         certificate or any of that other 
                         horseshit.

                                     MILES
                         I'd rather have a knife.

                                     JACK
                         No. No. You've been officially 
                         depressed for like two years now, 
                         and you were always a negative guy 
                         anyway, even in college. Now it's 
                         worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching 
                         English to fucking eighth-graders 
                         when they should be reading what you 
                         wrote. Your books.


hmm, what else.  Well, tried out that Xuqa thing.  www.xuqa.com for anyone who wants to try it.  i see it as facebook and myspace put together.  i live it cause its a college thing where i can acutally join (facebook doesnt have IRCC :( ) its fun...has alot of fun things built in....i dunno.  Try it out peoples, doesnt hurt.  Unless you have no friends.

well, i've run outta steam.  I'd just like to mention i was pretty much having another lucid dream today, but i was awoken by my noisy family.  really sucks.  Second time ever, and the same thing happened...its so hard to explain, but it was just awsome.



Anyway, whatever.  I wanna head to the beach tomorrow...lets see what happens.



seeya'lls later.

"event","HEY, WHOA.




yeah, haven't updated in awhile, so i figured i should do it now.  Im supposed to be studying for this englsih exam tomorrow, but i have most of it down, i just have to go over some stuff here and there quickly before i go to sleep.  No big deal.


So whats new with me?  Well, nothing really.  Been schooling, and thats about it.  Things feel like there going so fast...i still feel like its august.  very wierd.  I guess it's cause i haven't really have a temperature change..coming from NY, the temperature is definitely a reminder of the times...but it's like, i came from summer to, well, summer.  Still trying to get used to that.

Been looking for a job too.  If you didnt already know, everybody north of the mason-dixon (?) line is coming down to Port St. Lucie.  A vast majority are young adults like myself.  And as i've heard many times here..the only thing to do is to go to school, and to work...well, yeah, all the good place are basically taken.  Best Buy and Circuit city are in my crosshair, and i'll prolly get a job as seasonal...but my only worry is that i acutally might get fired....whatever though, cant think THAT far ahead.  A freind works at circuit city, said he can hook me up...so i was like ""fuck, hell yeah"".  So lets see how that goes.  I'll drive over there sometime next week.

Oh wait, HAHA, i forgot, cant drive there without my car.  The one i was suppose to have registered by now, but dont, cause florida car dealerships suck the big ass.  my title hasnt come in yet.  great.  Suppose to be here last wednesday by the way, and it fucked up my whole plan for the weekend, which involved me and sabby visiting rob in orlando, and going to universal...yeah, and to add to that, i got acouple essays due this month, and i need to spend time on them.  so i dont know when im gonna be able to go...PLUS, i have no job, so i have no money.

So as you can see, things down here are...intresting.  And the fact that i haven't gone to a full session at the gym since like, july is seriously not helping.  Working out at home officially sucks, and i cannot see how people can do that.  I can never get motivated enough to do more than i can, and theres no sufficient room, or weight.  I was suppose to join this place up the street, but havent gotten around to it.  I should really get to it tomorrow.  I prolly have alot to go from 225 bench.  I prolly cant even lift 145 now...just gonna have to see.  Still have some muscle juice left.

But let me get off that subject...i've been trying to make some friends down here, as i mentioned awhile back..and its goinfg alright..but its alittle slow...right now im working on bettering my relationship on this girl i have a crush on..i think shes 19-20, but fuck it, im going for it.  i figure nobody but a couple of people know how old i am ANYWAY, so according to everyone else, im a twnty-something.  Sweet.  Just hope they dont see my lisence, cause in florida, if your under 21, the licenses are vertical.  Hopefull no one will find out...or care for that fact :D


hmmmmmm.  Been playing guitar...the acoustic is getting seriously annoying. But i still wont buy a electric unless its the Les Paul Supreme.  All i need now is 2500 dollars. anyone wanna help?  yeah, thought so...


Im getting alittle sloppy with school i realized.  Thats not good.  Its prolly cause all my classes are morning classes.  Yeah, i gotta wake up, and get into high gear.  with the help of those starbuck coffee things, i should be fine...unless i get addicted to caffiene...


well, i guess thats it for now ya'll, sorry i didnt have anything better to write about...but as you all know, even if there WAS some stuff bothering me (which there is)..i wouldn't say it...cause im non-chalant about just about everything.  just the way i am.

Im officially 18...it feels the same.  I expected that.  But its so wierd.

Like, its a whole new thing to me.  I realized that time for me is so much different.  I dont really feel older, but i feel exicted...cause im slowy inching towards the age i look like.


18.  God damn.



Well, today was alright.  Woke up after yet another wierd dream, got ready, and headed off to class.  I had math and psy.  Math sucks the big ones, but its cool, cause right after i have psy, my favorite class so far.  Anyway, those classes went well, especially psy, cause we talked about dreams and shit.  And though im not as enthusiastic as i once was in learning about them, it was nice having discussions and asking questions.

Anyway, i get out of class, and i call my parents...they wanted to go out to lunch with me, so we went to the Olive Garden again....2nd time this week.  our waiter was this black dude that acted like dorian.  It was CRAZY.  then we went to the mall...bought some more shirts...and ive been home.



I recently just got off the phone with a 3 way between sabby, korny and myself.  Talk about presents.  The chemistry between us makes for pure funk i swear.  Personally, its what i needed.  Sure, a big party with ALL my freinds will top anything, but we cant always get what we want.  I just thought it was really cool how we talked, and it seemed like almost nothing change, when just about everything else has.


So just as the strings attached to my floating balloons, im hanging in there.  Things ARE in fact getting a little more intresting around here.  Of course the girls...but im no ladies man.  Im very shy...and usually perfer the girls to do all the preliminary work....once i get the green light though, im off and running.  But you guys know that.  And as for freinds, slowly but surely.  I just have to get my mind off of all the stuff other people are doing right now.  i feel like ive been thrusted into this situation.  maybe as a test or something, to see how i can handle it. Who knows.  This is me just being all thinking-like.

Speaking of thinking, i cant stop thinking about this weekend, and how much fun its probably gonna be for most of you.  Just thinking about it now is getting me un-easy.  I dont know.

Whatever. I hope u guys have a blast. Really, i do.  Just party double for me fellas.


hmmm.  Oh yeah, we still gotta find out what were doing for these breaks.  I dont think anyone knows one another's break schedule, and we should, especially if ya'll wanna come down.  My hope arent to high right now for that though, cause these breaks are still along ways off.   Hopefully, eveything will work out for the best in the end.


I dunno why, but typing this shit out, i got super emo.  Its prolly all the break-up's, partying with out me, me not meeting new people fast enough shit. 

bah.


Anyway, but other than this, its been a alright day.


Thanks for everyone that wished me a happy birthday.  you'll never know how much i appreciate that.



well, anyway, i feel procrastination setting in....maybe ill go do something else after this.



whatever.



party-on.

Entry time.




A lot has happened since the entry before last.  Not alot.  But enough.  I wont go into detail, its really not worth it, but i shall give u the highlights.



Well, first, i should mention im looking for new a new car.  The van did me well in New york..transporting many a people to and from croton.  Great times.  but a 6 cylinder car with these gas prices is not what i need right now.  Well, anyway, i say van, cause the mercedes is already sold.  Well, i looked around, and acutally found a decent, cheap car.  A 87' Porsche 944. one of my fav. looking cars of all times (im a sucker for hatchbacks), for like, 3000.  Long story short, when we got there, the dealership was closed for a hurricane that wasnt even gonna hit em...and it was like, a 2 hour drive.  Anyway, we said fuck that, and started looking at other ones.  Some lesbians were selling this eclipse, and my dad saw it and shit, but they were asking to much for the condition it was in...if the head gasket didnt need replacement, we'd buy it, cause it would be a steal...but no....so forget about it.  anywayz, by now my father realized that there are no good, under 4000 dollar cars in florida, period.  And 99 percent of them are being sold in dealerships that charge almost a extra 500 dollars of taxes.  Bastards.  So anyway, now im stuck either waiting for something to come up, or getting one thats around 10,000, getting a job (like i need a car to get a job..), and start paying to payments myself.  I guess i dont have a BIG BIG problem with that...but i dont wanna be working for a car that i dont really like...so i figured i'll take the 2 things i love in the car world...Mercedes, and Hatchback, and try to get me a C230 Kompressor.  Its the little ones with a super-charger..you've seen em'. but yeah, i've found good ones for like, 18, 000.  now THAT i would work for.  but thats just me...you guys no me by now, i like to talk before i do, so lets see how far this ends up going.



And i would just like to mention that i am extremely awake right now.  yeah.



I think it's cause i took a nap today..because of when i woke up today.  EARLY.  Today was acutally rather wierd for me.  As mentioned in the other entry, i really dont like it down here.  Whether i end up making good freinds down here or not, i really dont like it.  things are to different....i miss the cool, fall, NY air.  Fall is my favorite season dammit!  nice cool low 70's, high 60's are where im at home....with the nice color of the leaves...the smell of burning wood from houses....perfection.  Just walking in that makes me feel so good.  But no..im stuck with thunderstorms like everyday, with a constant high of 88 or more...its nice sometimes, i'll admit, but its not one bit fun.  anyway, today i have only one class....english....2 hours.  


totally missed it.



I was just off today.  Since i woke up, i was wierd.  I had a pretty crazy dream that involved a certain someone, and after that i just wanted to stay home.  Anyway, i get up late, dont get fully dressed (so off the bat i feel like shit), then i just left.  I had to take the BMW cause the van now has a flat (and u wonder why i need a car).  Anyway, i literally drive to the school, drive past it, and came back home.  I was making the excuse that no one was in class, so i just left (theres only like, 5 people in that class...its English Composition 2....with my typos? go figure..).  The only thing i was worried about was coming home, and seeing my mom...she'd throw a monkey wrench in my whole program.  well, she WAS home..and she made a fuss about how i should have gone to the office and shit....well, she calle...i pretty much got busted...pretended i went to a wrong building or something...and went out...but i didnt go to school....i just drove around more.  ill be the first to admit i was fucking depressed today folks.  like streight up.  I was feeling like shit.  i literally just drove around listening to music. i drove around until it was the usual time i;d get home, and got home and just got on the comp (the only thing i do anymore) and listen to musi (the only other thing i do anymore).  My parents were convinved i went....anyway, after that i go out with them, while my mom does her errands, and i get home, and i've been here ever since.  


the nap was good though.  I've learned that no matter HOW stressed out, or depressed, or sad, or anything i am..after i go to sleep, i will always, ALWAYS feel better about it, no matter what it is....and trust me...this is a proven method...but yeah.  i think thats why im so awake.


Other than that, things were chill....i started writing my letter to andy. Something ya'll should definitely should start doing.  Esther told me he really wants to hear from us, so he knows were all still freinds.  I know thats crazy to think about...ofcourse were still freinds...but thats the way hes thinking right now, so we gotta come through.  U guys can email them to me if u want..i wont read em, i swear...ill send em out though.


I talked to maike shortly today too.  good convo..but it made me miss the summer immensly.  We had some pretty damn good times....personally it was a rollar coaster, even when i got here..but over all, good times.  i wish there was a easy way for all of us to hang out again, with no parents and no worries...somewhere where we can do what we do best...maybe spring break i suppose.  But speaking of spring break, we all have to see when we have ours, and we have to coordinate.  Cause if were still going to Panama City, then we'd have to make resevations for hotels and save up a good amount of money and shit.  if not, we can get a hotel in north miami...i know acouple of good ones...and we can hang out in miami the whole time.  I've been down there during spring break...with my parents...but i've seen the action!  its awsome!


hmm..what else. hmm. yeah, i guess im done.  Just me, and a half empty bottle of vodka.  




no im not gonna.... 





but i thought about it.

P.S (EDIT)


I just looked at some older entries...the ""freinds only"" ones...came across this poem i wrote.  It still means alot to me.  I think the best poem ive ever written.  just gonna repost it.  It's about how i felt when i found a old christmas card from laura.


A Card ( this is gonna suck btw)




You know, your first love never leaves,

in your head she swims, through your veins she bleeds

I try to forget this, and it always works,

But i need help from alchohol, my reality it distorts;

with retorts i reply any ""how are you feeling?""

But inside my heart is on the ground, kneeling

gently stealing

my innosence

it burns like incense

i know it's non-sense....



I found a card tonight, that brought me back

to the first 3 months, before love went black

before all of that

and before i can store memories of these new girls, the ones that bore, and tore a bigger hole in my already shattered soul,

i remember you, the help i tried to give, beyond me you were, out of reach.

my helping hand was only speech.

And i cried for you, i cried like jesus died, 

not knowing what the true purpose was, where all that was going

I think of this now, because...



I found a card tonight.

And within the pre-written words lie what you were thinking.

my eyes were just blinking,

reminding my mind with every eye shutter, that these memories cannot be uttered, mutterd, or ever written

but like a opressed soul, im coming out and releasing my soul

the pen is the bridge, my mind is the toll.



and i think about you

more than i should.

I could stop

but it'll just come out in other ways.


I found a card tonight.



what eats me more than i can say, is the way you treated your body, in those unatural ways.

your pain was mine, but i still stood by you

like glue

to you

i was yours.

i wanted to be the one to help you, tears of joy would have poured

but like a replacable part in your so called life, i was used, and thrown away.

its like nothing happened.

Maybe since the beginning it should have stayed that way.


I Found a Card tonight.


It was christmas time,

3 months into something that had the potential to last a life-time

We were one.

but now its done.

The book was shorter than we ever knew

we were dust as the wind blew..




You know your card says ""i will always love you""

well, once upon a time....I loved you too.



A found a card tonight."

Had some free time, and since we unplugged the satellite TV, all i have is my comp right now.

So anyway, im sure you guys have been wondering whats been going on with me

no? too bad, telling u anyway.

SO i guess the biggest news is that i finally settled on a major that'll give me a lot of flexibility, and still give me a more than decent salary.  Im gonna major is psychology.  yes yes.  before you all start laughing at me and what not, i think its fair to point out that i dont want to be a clinical one, you know..the sit in a chair...let me here about your problems....no, no, no....i have enough problems of my own..i dont need to here anyone elses.  My goal is to maybe get some where in advertising maybe? i dunno, the door is still wide open, i just know that thats my new goal.

Another goal of mine is to get the hell out of this house.  Back in the day (and i havbe the entries to prove it), i bitched about not having a house..and how everyone should BE so lucky....we i have one now....its lovely....couldnt ask for anything more....


BUT I WANT OUT.


I'm tired of my family, honestly.  Its getting to the point that every day i stay here just makes me want to leave more and more.  And i dont just want to go anywhere.  I want to go to a college...eat, sleep, and play there....make new freinds there....start a new chapter there, yah know?  COming this spring ill be applying to like, 2 or 3 colleges.  Mainly Bing though.  One of the top public schools in the country aint bad...and it doesnt hurt to have a good ossining population there either...which includes jonesy.  So i have my fingers crossed for that.


I also have my fingers crossed for another car.  My dads freind is buying the benz, but i have to wait till my dad gets back from NY, cause he left the title of teh car in his BMW.  I would love to have his beemer...but its a V8..and gas isnt exactly a dollar anymore...


But all this doesnt matter....just my little dreams im having...thats what i am i guess...a dreamer.


I've also been doing some patch work with some old freinds, mainly laura.  Hope you guys arent pissed at me...but i honestly dont like having bad blood with anyone.

hmm..what else..what else....this weekend i MIGHT be heading up to orlando with sabby to chill at robs.  I say might cause my parents might not let me go...not becuase its to far...they already let me drive to miami...its the money....id have to go a hour south to get sabby from west palm, then 2 hours back up just to get to orlando.  Sure, i'd  be on 95 and the florida turnpike, but gas is gas...and the benz is a 6 cylinder.  I dont know exaclty how things are going to work out, but i guess ill have to wait till next weekend to get something going.


If that doesnt work, ill hopefully be heading to some bars.  Tomorrow i have Bio, with that 22 year old brandon.  Gonna see if we can get something going.  the only thing im afraid of is showing up at a bar, and not being able to get in..or someone finding out my age..or something crazy like that....so far everyone thinks im atleast 21....i gotta hold my cover for awhile...seems like the only way i can have fun. Sure, some people already know im still 17, but whatever...dont really care about them to much.


Oh, if you guys didnt know, Dave decided to make stupid ink.  Dont know exactly WHY...maybe he got bored or something...but heres the address: http://e.1asphost.com/stupidink/.  Check it out.  its alittle distration from the everyday...plus we can all keep in touch with each other.  Other than our Livejournals and Myspace's, and facebook's.


hmm..waht else...i acutally look at the lyrics to fall out boys 'sugar, were going down"" or whatever that song is called...thats a pretty sweet song...love the lyrics. especially the ""I'm just a notch in your bedpost, But you're just a line in a song"".  rossome lines.


anywho....oh yeah, i forgot.  I got the address for andy, and i thought it would be neat if we orginized, and send him a envelope with like, everyones letter.  I dunno, just thought that would be pretty cool.  he is fighting for our freedom and shit, atleast we can send him a letter each...keep him updated and shit.  Comment or email me, or IM me on what ya think..shit, i'll send it out, all u guys have to do is send them to me.


and i guess i have to mention it, just so no one forgets, and i feel all bad and shit...my birthday is on the 28th of this month....yes yes.  Steve is finally going to be legal.  My plans are to buy a cigar, play the lotto, and immediately star in a porno flick using my stage name....El Gigante Perro.  Or...the large dog.


lol



anyway ya'll, im talking to a few people, and listening to some music, so ill write in next time.


take care now, ya hear?

"event","so it's 9:30, and im at home...





I find myself sinking into this pit of self pity that is just making my experience here in florida that much worse.  I miss the nights where time was just a number, nothing else....where waking up late afternoon was the norm....where all of us hung out, no holds-bar action, almost everynight.  Where being sober was more rare than not being sober.


My class ended at around 12...i went to sleep at one...woke up at 6....

My day has been a waste, and this night is going to be too.  I guess its my fault in a sense.  i was the one that went out so much, and my body got used to the constant action.  I still long for those moments.  I miss making memories.  

And yea, i know, i still have yet to make any good freinds, but judging by the way things are going, it should out to be a intresting task.  Turns out all these people that look 18-19 are in fact, 21 to 23.  Which is awsome, but also sucks at the same time, cause that means most of the girls are alot older than me...but it's cool....im still gonna have fun.  I'm making a buddy in this dude called Brandon, he hails from key west.  Were prolly gonna go bar hoping.  Maybe that'll make me change my mind about the current situation.

I dunno...i guess im so bummed out because i know most of the people at their traditional Universities are most likely partying there asses off....or atleast having some sort of fun....im at home...with a car that consumes to much gas, and no where to go.

*sigh*...

whatever though.  I have a feeling i have bigger things coming my way anyway.   All i have to do now is wait for it.


P.S.

Nonsense, is it more than an aesthetic for juvenile abandon, the derelict! ? For if I surround myself in this, I am this, and I am owed more (by comparison to my brother). 

But I don't do this. WAIT. The tension between these two forces. Entropy versus God. I don't believe in god, there is only entropy. 

The paradox is in this - the order imposed on existence against reality."

"event","<strong>&nbsp;</strong><p>Under the present, and urgent, circumstances, there are only two ways of looking at Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's new book, <i>Multitude</i>. Either, one is to say, with the neoconservative philosopher Francis Fukuyama, who reviewed it for the <i>New York Times</i>, that it proposes ""imaginary solutions"" to ""imaginary problems."" (Though hiring Fukuyama to review a book by noted Marxists is like hiring a hit man rather than a critic.) The other way of looking at this book is as if it were an impressive car wreck--impressive because it has a lot of spare parts that can be recycled. Many in fact aspire to less, and this is perhaps the greatness of Hardt and Negri's concepts: that they will a revolutionary becoming with such intensity that they destroy themselves in the process.&nbsp;<br /><br />(WHAT? </p><p><i>Mutlitude</i> is Hardt and Negri's sequel to their bestseller--or really, box-office hit--<i>Empire</i>, which was to the WTO protest and the series of confrontations that it sparked (D.C., Quebec, Genoa, etc...) what Michael Moore's <i>Fahrenheit 9-11</i> is to WTC and the wars that it has spawned (Afghanistan, Iraq, the Philippines, and so on...). <i>Empire</i> was the first book to reassess recent history since Fukuyama had claimed--after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1991--that the transnational capitalist class had finally reached heaven, raptured by the Gods of neoliberalism and globalization. For Fukuyama it was the end of history: Capitalism having attained its zenith, the world being perfect, there was nothing more for humans to want, and hence no more history to be made. More soberly, Hardt and Negri argued that globalization meant not the absolute fulfillment of all desire but a transformation in the structures of power--from the age of national sovereignty to the age of global sovereignty. ""Empire"" was their name for a new articulation of power on a global scale, no longer seated in one particular nation-state, but spread out among multinational corporations and international financial and political institutions that represented strictly elite interests. Thus, Empire meant that the world was at a point of crisis, not of fulfillment. The stage was set for the WTO showdown. </p><p>The concept of Empire names the global elite, whereas the idea of the multitude is the face of those who are exploited by that order. If the form of sovereignty has expanded from the nation to the planet, so has that of the subject that resists its domination, from Marx's old, white, male industrial proletariat to something called the multitude. But, admittedly, this is all very vague: What is the multitude? What does it want? What is its condition? These were the questions on which <i>Empire</i> ended and which the sequel takes up. </p><p>With <i>Multitude</i>, Hardt and Negri are promising to resolve a problem that has frustrated all leftists for the last 30 years: How do you create a movement for social change that is composed of racially, ethnically, culturally, sexually diverse subjects and yet is coherent without privileging one particular group's perspective and interests? The answer of the traditional Marxist movements had been to subordinate all other grievances to those of factory workers, the proletariat. But the result of that was clearly unsatisfactory. The identity movements inaugurated<b> </b>by the 1968 moment (Black Power, feminism, gay rights, and so on) went on the opposite course, preserving the specificity of their demands but unable to make connections with other struggles (the Black Power movement was sexist and homophobic, the feminist movement was racist, the gay rights movement was phallocentric). Hardt and Negri's solution: Maintain the diversity of these groups but establish the thing that makes them communicate. And what makes them communicate is the common, Hardt and Negri's term for the universal conditions that make life possible. And this is where the book crashes. </p><p>Gille Deleuze, one of Hardt and Negri's major inspirations, argued that one should distinguish between identity and singularity. Identity means that something exists by opposition to everything else (which presumes a comparison) whereas singularity means that that thing is unique, incomparable to anything else, and hence different in and of itself. Hardt and Negri take up Deleuze's concept to claim that the different movements issued from 1968 are singularities, not identities: What distinguishes them is not how they preserve their own agendas in opposition to those of the others but the richness and uniqueness of experience that they bring to the table--the common. Hence, the multitude is a multitude of singularities that live in common. </p><p>Given this structure of the multitude, one would expect to see a cacophonous carnival of colors. But what we get instead--and this is the glitch that causes the meltdown--is what looks like a Marxist revolutionary party without a chairman, a disciplined body without a disciplinarian. By the end of the book, Hardt and Negri's multitude looks like it's ready for the Second Coming, except it is the Christ waiting (who knows what for?) to resurrect himself. The multitude is at once savior and saved, Church and Divinity, Father and Son. </p><p>Let's grant there is a multitude: It's a beautiful concept and, for the most part, it makes sense. But, looking at the world around us, things are obviously not as harmonious as the note on which Hardt and Negri's book ends. The multitude, if it is composed of genuine singularities, cannot be the self-consistent subject they claim it to be. </p><p>This is far from saying that there are no useful concepts in <i>Multitude</i>--it's a must-read for anybody interested in an alternative future. It contains some of the best discussions that we are aware of on how direct democracy could work in a global context and on the relationship between social change and violence. <i>Multitude </i>is a creative contribution to the most important conversation of our day. But the theory in <i>Multitude</i> is still inadequate when it comes to the realities of the multitude. <i></i></p><!-- story_text -->"

"event","In Cold Blood has a remake ""Infamous"" selling itself with ""theres more to the story than you know"" and features&nbsp;more stars than Dustin Hoffman. Shortbus is going to be stupid if i ever even bother to watch it, which I prolly wont be able to do because the torrent sucks. I watched Apocalypto last night and&nbsp;my&nbsp;&nbsp;comment is that Mel Gibson is a weirdo. I have this feeling that all the grunting in the score,&nbsp; was all done by Mel. In addition there are many things unsettling about the story and depiction of Mayans."

Teenage girl in suburbs finds herself not wanting conformity. Is hit in the forehead with a soccer ball. Bikes to outside of urban landscape. back in her room she is drawing herself as a ghost,&nbsp; sister interruptes her drawing pretending to be a ghost, throws something at her,&nbsp; transforms herself into image of ghost with makeup and sheet, goes biking in the dark and is followed by images of ghosts and skulls, gayfully smiles, lifts into the air to join images, finds boy also dressed as ghost in sky, rests head on shoulder, end. 

America 

synthetically mixed and mashed sped up and slowed down 
oo, bf n gf 

The video begins with a fade-in of an adolescent&nbsp; female sleeping, The beat breaks in with what ambigiously sounds like pillow talk and a screaming child this is overlapped by a shot of her 'tossing and turning'&nbsp; as female opens eyes. A brief black the memofidelity this time mostly whistles continues, is broken by banging do sh do sh do sh do sh, montage of statue of liberity, giving a key, making out, shot of subject looking at sleeping lover, shot of subjects eye reflecting shots of getting dressed, boyfriend walking down metropolitan steps, shots of new york- sharing apt guy and girl walking in hallway, times square, bumping into someone on subway, boyfriend in park, sounds of conversation girl might be explaining to boyfriend [""you know...its you... are like...has to be like this...""] Shot: nyc apt. bldgs, girl bumps into guy on sidewalk&nbsp; male tells lude remarks, girl turns around&nbsp;&nbsp; [..what about?]. The montage goes between the girl's eye reflecting boyfriend and when reflecting shots of new york it is no longer a reflection but an account of her going-abouts. There is a brief pause where a shot of the view of new york from her apt window pans down to the lovers. The music at this point is between water/heaving breathing/child playing. then the two lovers entwine. Less 'noise' more melodical breathing and beats. Music re bangs itself in, speed up scene of her at bar while multiple men approach her, she slowly drinks. Her eye- black guy embracing her, subways, park, snow. Back at bar she is entertaining with semi- concentration the courtship of various men this time sitting at a table, beat gets faster, she is now fully concentrating on suitors. Shot of her eye seeing a fat guy giving her the ""o"" face then another guy. Shot of friend explaining [if you].. Boyfriend waking up next to her. Her self getting out of bed, getting dressed,fades out of boyfriend sitting in bed thinking about what to do not saying anything, in his underwear not going anywhere while the girl whose apt. it is leave. a high pitched noise/beat plays 

Clearly for M83 America&nbsp; is best represented through the eyes of a girl (beatles throw back) in new york and her black boyfriend that she'd rather not commit to because chance of encounters are not worth giving up. My question for the story is, where did this dude come from? clearly&nbsp;he is established in her life before she gets into the whole virtue of meeting people at bars thing but is this a return of art ""return of concentration"" or is she teaching herself to replace him?"

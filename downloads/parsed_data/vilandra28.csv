"event","Today is one of those days when I really really really really <b>despise</b> taking mass transportation. 

It's sweltering hot and humid outside. For the past few days, the weather here in NYC has been hitting an ungodly temperature of 104 degrees. Lately the walk to the subway isn't as pleasurable as it was during Spring ... or better yet in the Fall (<3 Fall). In any case, I get to the usually crowded subway, wishing that the train was already here. Well, one did arrive, and I managed to squish myself in it. I was relieved to make it in inside ... until I realized that there wasn't any air conditioner in that one particular car >.< I couldn't make my way towards the doors since I was already in the middle of the car and surrounded hip to hip with people. Ugh ... needless to say, it wasn't very enjoyable. The lack of air and the throngs of sweaty people (a lot with horrible body odor *shudders*) made me just want to pass out from discomfort. 

I was ready to die. It was the longest and most unbearable 20 minute subway ride home. GAWD. 

Needless to say, as soon as I arrived home, I dropped everything on the floor and jumped in the shower. Man, I <3 showers. 

Advice for the day ... stay at home when it's freaking 100 something degrees outside ... if you must go out ... never ever ever ever take the subway home unless you don't mind feeling like a sardine squished in a suffocating can. UGH"

"event","Yesterday, my guild and I continued our quest to plow through AQ 40. I wasn't with them for the first few bosses (they did that the other day), but I joined them for the Trash Mobs and the Fankriss boss. Fankriss went down pretty easily, and even though that was my first time encountering him, my guildies were nice enough to give me a heads up on what to expect. What's funny is that a bunch of us started wiping when Fankriss was at 3 %. Then more people went down by 2 %. Finally Fankriss died but at the cost of all of us dying as well! LOL! As someone said in guild chat, ""Hey, at least we get the phat lewtz!"" 

Then we encountered Princess Huhuran ... now that was fun! LOL! Imagine if you will a huge group (40 players) of lvl 60s with insane epic gears. Everything was going pretty well for our first try - no deaths and healers still having plenty of mana. Then we got to 30 % ... and everything went down hill from there! See, at 30 %, the Princess decides to have a hissy fit and double her attack speed as well as spit out 2000 damage poison bolts every 3 seconds (chick needs to take some Midol)! People immediately went down - but some of us still managed to stay alive (amazingly enough). Our main tank went down and another was able to get aggro. Alas though ... at around 24 % (or was it 28 %?), we wiped. Sux0rs. 

We gave her another shot - we did about 5 tries until we finally called it a night. We realized that a lot of us still need some gear with Nature Resist (I'm one of those people ... mine's pretty sad actually); thus a bunch of us got into little groups of 5 and invaded Mauradon. 

Overall though, it was a lot of fun =) Can't wait to see what happens next (though I think tonight the guild will do BWL)."

"event","So I spent a good part of my break reading the forum threads in WoW - specifically for the realm that I play, and wow ... my guild definitely gets flamed by both the Horde and Alliance. Nice! LOL! Do they faze me? Not really. In fact, after reading all those complaints and presuppositions (apparently, we've been accused of using hacks any time we accomplish a first for our faction ... and sorry to disappoint but our firsts have been accomplished by a lot of hard work, teamwork, some frustrations, and definitely a lot of wipes :P), I've never been more proud to be part of this guild. Are we elitist jerks? Not all of us though it's not as if there isn't a guild out there that doesn't house one or two. Do we get unfair biases because of our supposed rep? You betcha ... but do we complain about it? Not really because honestly, reading what other people have to say about us - most of which are so exaggerated that it's beyond belief - well, it's quite amusing. It's not to make fun of anyone, not at all - people are free to express their opinions, but honestly, we know who we are, what we do, and what we don't do and when people make so many assumptions based on what they've heard from other people ... well, let's just say that it makes for a very comedic reading. 

I especially love how people would immediately post a complaint about my guild stealing someone's dragon kill or what not. Yet there were times when the situation was reversed ... where my guild got screwed over. Did we complain about it in the forums? Nope! Why? Because we know it's a game and yeah, it sux0rs that someone took our kill and we might bitch and moan about it in guild chat, but we don't go around flaming the guild that took the kill from us. In the long run, that dragon will respawn again and my guild and I will just have to make sure to get there first before anyone =)

Besides, if anyone was to even care to look past the rep, they'll see that appearances can be deceiving. On the weekends, my guild runs an alt MC event which as the name implies is a Molten Core run for the guild's alts. What makes this stand out is that the raid leader also welcomes members from other guilds to join us and have the chance to partake in one of the most challenging raids in the game. We've also helped out members from other guilds attain their keys whenever we have the free time (our week is usually filled with raiding, ie AQ 40, 20, BWL, ZG, MC, etc). We do have people that stop and help out people having a difficult time with mobs.

This guild works so hard, displays such amazing and impressive teamwork, and accomplishes so much in the game. In the long run, these are traits that are evident in all the great guilds in the World of Warcraft. 

So, to those that hate us: /smile - your stories about us are so damn amusing ... keep it up XD. To those who like us: /smile - thanks for looking beyond the reputation."

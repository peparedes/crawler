"event","I think i have put myself into the most unreal of situations ever. For the first time in my life, I feel like I have done what I felt like I needed to do, and ignored what I was feeling inside me. I have not really decided wether or not this is going to come and bite me in the ass, or if something amazing and true is going to come out of it. I know that right now, nothing has settled in, or actually caught up to my brain or my emotions. I do know that my apartment is big and unsettling, as it always has been with just me in it. 

I do not want to give into all the bias i have in my life. Seven different people telling me different stories. Seven different people trying to tell me what to do with my life, and who to be with, and what to do. Why can I not decide what I want to do with my life. It is my life, and I have more than me telling me what to do with it. MY LIFE, PLEASE LET ME LIVE IT TO THE POTENTIAL THAT I WANT.  


I already miss what I do not have right now.

Go to http://www.organdonor.gov to get a donor registration card, sign it, date it, and have two other people sign it. Carry it around with you in your wallet. If anything happens to you, your organs will be donated to someone in need.

You can also sign up with your state saying that you are an organ donor. There for is you dont have your card with you, they can still donate you organs. Go to http://www.livingbank.org/site/PageServer?pagename=homepage&JServSessionIdr003=2q8jgsprp1.app8b

I promise this page takes all of two minutes to fill out. Its not long at all. 

its simple, all you need is a pen, internet, and two other people with hands to sign something. No reason not to... its so easy. 


Print out a bunch, print out as many as you need and give them to people. Ask around, please try to get as many people to register!


thank you."

"event","This is probably very rondom for most of you to read about in live journal, but it means alot to me, and other people who are in need of some sort of transplant. All i am asking you to do is become a organ donor. There really is no reason not to. If anything happens to you, you can save the lives of over 6 people. No one thinks that passing away can be a blessing to other families, or even someone in your family, but it truley is. You can no longer do it one your drivers liscence, but if you go to Texmed.org you can become a donor there. It is that simple. 

Over 3000 people die each year waiting for an organ transplant, and there are over 36,000 people waiting for one. If everyone would become a donor, these peoples lives would be saved by the loss of another. My Aunt was one of those people who died waiting for a liver transplant, which is why becoming a donor means so much to me. It is a simple task that doesnt take much effort, but in the end will be such a great gift to some one.  


That is all.

go, and save the lives of people in need."

I think its a combo of the weather (roar) and it being Easter and my mother stuffing us with caseroles. AKSUAHSKJANSBD

AHH!HQKHGDSDA! yes. AUGSASGHGDS

I saw John today finally for the first time in like 4 weeks. His tattoo looks awsome. And i got them cheap chinese food. yeah. go zoe. 
Lydia finally quit her job, after they called her fat, and made her work everyday for a whole week. I love how people have no respect for anyone any more.

Natalie got her surf board and was swimming around with it. i dont know how she did it because i was in the water for like 5 minutes and was purple. She was in there forever, and come out fine. How she did that.. no one will ever know. So yesterday was awsome as well. I have to work tommorow from 11-9, which is no beuno because of the soul fact i have tons of shit to do. SO thats means no sleep for me. =( I HATE WORKING!

This one has been filled with soo much stuff. Jake and I went to the Chocolate exibite (sp) at the museum yesterday and walked around downtown for a while. I've decided the Metro Lightrail is the dumbest thing ever. Maybe if it blew a horn or somehow let people know it was comming it would be better, but its right next to side walks and such with nothing stopping people from walking into it if they are not paying attention. I think they need to go about finding a safety device to that thing. its like a fucking train going through downtown and not telling anyone. its stupid. now that im done ranting about that.... 
natalie grant jake and i all ventured into Galveston today for no reason. Spur of the moment kinda thing, and it was fun. We went shopping on the Strand (again) and i got a ten dollar purse. mega cute ( did u just say that?) and then we went walking on the beach after the sun went down. it was so pretty. i want to live on the beach. Grant and Natalie make me happy. They are sooo cute.

"event","<FONT size=1>This week is sucking. Too much shit to do and think about. Im trying to have a conversation with people on AIM and no one is talking back, its kind of frustrating. The Balfour people came today and talked to us about gettting out cap and gown and all the other BULLSHIT things from the c/o '04!! and yah all of them are lame as can be and i dont understand why people would buy anything from them, but thats just me.&nbsp; I think i am going to go *car shopping* again today, and maybe test drive a rodeo and a liberty. I dont know why i want a SUV when i am so worried about that little thing called gas mileage. Makes no sense what so ever to me, but i want one damnit! I found a dollar in my pocket. HORRAY!</FONT>"

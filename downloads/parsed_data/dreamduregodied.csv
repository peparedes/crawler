so to add to the scary shit thats been happening...the other me and court were driving, i started reaching for the mirror, but courtney didnt notice, and shes like can you fix the mirror, and i knew she was going to say it, without knowing the mirror needed to be moved...and then today was the worst, we were going to see her dad at work after getting my check, and we were on a back road, and i didnt have my seat belt on, and then i just suddenly grabbed it and put it on wicked fast, so courtney slowed down cuz she didnt know what was wrong, and we went around a blind turn and there was a truck backing up really fastly into the road...we would have hit it...

so yup, fucking weird.

heres a few special ones...

eric, well where to begin with you. you are an great person and im glad ive been able to spend these last 6 months, good or bad with you. and i do still care about you. im sorry for everything i did to you, i realize now, i did it wrong. i did everything all wrong, and i really apologize. i also, well, want to thank you for helping through everything, for being there, and helping me learn a lot about myself. so im supposing this is my finally letting go of you, ""no last kiss, and no goodbye"" as from autumn to ashes says, this is my last goodbye. ""i wish you joy and happiness, but above all things i wish you love""

courtney, i couldnt have asked for a better best friend. you are always there and hope you always will be, you know everything, and through it all, youve stayed by me. i cant wait till you get back so i can tell you everything. ive done some shitty things to you to im suspecting, so i apologize profusly, never meant to hurt you.

adam, well i suppose this is where i say you were right, and i was wrong. 

and mark, thanks, you make me so happy, and you are helping me get out of this, although you dont really know what most of this is, ill tell you tho. you put a smile on my face, and thats what i need now. im keeping my fingers crossed, cuz for some reason i think this could go good...<3

~+~A dry tongue
Screams at the sky
But the wind just breathes words in
As a strange bird tries to fly

Pieces of us die everyday
As though our flesh were hell
Such <b>injustice</b>, 
as <b>children we are told that from god we fell.</b>

Where are my angels?
Wheres my golden one?
Wheres my hope
now that my heroes have gone?
Some are being beaten
Some are being born.
And some cant tell the difference anymore~+~


They remind her of her lover, how he left her, and of times long ago.
<b>When she used to color carelessly painted his portrait
A thousand times-or maybe just his smile-</b>
And she and her canvas would follow him wherever he would go
cuz they were painters and they were painting themselves
A lovely world.
Oil streaked daisies covered the living room wall
He put water-colored roses in her hair
He said, ""Love, I love you, I want to give you mountains, the sunshine,
the sunset too
I want to give you everything as beautiful as you are to me~~


<b>Embrace the faceless, the unnamed
Kiss the flame</b>



++++Ophelia drowned in the water
Crushed by her own weight Hitler loved little blue eyed boys
And it drove him to hate
Birds always grow silent before the night descends 
cuz nature has a funny way of breaking what does not bend
A heros torso built of steel and novocain
His heart a bitter beat inside a bloodless frame
There was a hole inside his soul a manicure could not fill
<b>So he fund himself a whore to love while daisies choked in the window sill</b>
Weve made houses for hatred
Its time we made a place 
Where peoples souls may be seen and made safe
<b>Be careful with each other
These fragile flames
For innocence cant be lost
It just needs to be maintained</b>"

And i remember how i felt at that moment.
On top of hte world with you, holding me there.
Above everything, above the pain, above the suffering that we moved past.
And you kept me floating with teardrops of love.
But i fell.
I fell from the utopian dream
Hearing your name now is like cutting flesh.
Each time it gets a little easier.
With every movement of the blade a little more relief comes, in knowing thatyou are doing well.

gun shot bird, falls from the sky, much like i fell.
much like i am still falling, away from you.
and this time, you are not there to secure me when i fall.
you are only there to grasp me, grasp around my neck,
as your hands create my noose. just as it was always meant to be,
just as it will always be.

and in one moment of irrefutable positivity,
i think, i hope, maybe, just maybe,
then insecurity lays foundation in me, yet again.

beautifully lit amber sky, turns dark fades to grey, fades to nothingness.
moon rises in the unknown darkness, and you, the only one i wish to be with, arent here to see it with me. in my akward silence i stand in the moonlit shadow.
and you, the one that names me like poety, is gone.

love doesnt die, but it fades, you say it fades like summer, i say it doesnt, because summer always returns.

and the bird, or i, or maybe just the bird, continues to fall, past the lovely trees. 
to be ripped apart and eaten by the dogs below."

  Random
  Heel Toe Shifting
Learn proper race shifting to get your car into the right gear for drifting. Includes double clutch shifting.

Power Over 
This performed when entering a corner and using full throttle to produce heavy oversteer  through the turn. You need horsepower to make this happen. 

E-Brake Drift 
This technique is very basic, pull the E-Brake or side brake to induce rear traction loss and balance drift through steering and throttle play. This can also be used to correct errors or fine tune drift angles. Main drift technique used in FWD vehicles.

Clutch Kick
This is performed by depressing the clutch pedal on approach or during a mild drift,  then the clutch is ""popped"" to give a sudden jolt through the driveline to upset rear traction.  

Shift Lock Drift
This is performed by letting the revs drop on downshift into a corner and then releasing the clutch to put stress on the driveline to slow the rear tires inducing over steer. This is like pulling the E-brake through a turn,  but this should be performed on wet ground to minimize damage to the driveline.  

Dirt Drop Drift
This is performed by dropping the rear tires off the road into the dirt to maintain or gain drift angle without losing power or speed and to set up for the next turn. This technique is very useful for low horsepower cars. Do not attempt this technique at the Drift Session.

Feint Drift
This is performed by rocking the car towards the outside of a turn and then using the rebound of grip to throw the car into the normal cornering direction. This is heavy rally racing technique used to change vehicle attitudes during cornering. 

Jump Drift
In this technique the rear tire on the inside of a turn or apex is bounced over a curb to lose traction resulting in over steer. Do not attempt this technique at the Drift Session. 

Braking Drift
This is performed by trail braking into a corner. Loss of grip is obtained and then balanced through steering and throttle motions. This is mainly for medium to low speed corners. 

Kansei Drift
This is performed at race speeds. When entering a high speed corner a driver lifts his foot off the throttle to induce a mild oversteer and then balances the drift through steering and throttle motions. The car that is being used for this style of drift should be a neutral balanced car therefore the oversteer will induce itself. If the car plows through any turn this technique will not work. 

Long Slide Drift
This is done by pulling the E-brake through a strait to start a high angel drift and to hold this to set up for the turn ahead. This technique can only be done at high speed. 

Swaying Drift (Choku-Dori) 
This is a slow side-to-side faint like drift where the rear end sways back and forth down a strait. 
 

and here is random stuff now

"event","Never mess with a Marine!

An army 2Lt. is taking his platoon on patrol when his scouts come running back and say 
""Sir, there's a Marine standing in the way of the road"". 
The Lt. scoffs and sends a fire team to go investigate and remove the Marine. 
They approach the Marine and he begins to head for a small ridge
 on the side of the road and motions for them to follow. 
As the rest of the platoon advances and takes cover they hear yelling and screaming. 
The Marine emerges a couple minutes later and dusts himself off
 and again stands in the middle of the road.
The Lt. curses and calls for a squad to remove the Devil Dog. 
He again heads down to s small ridge and they follow. 
Once again there is blood-curdling screaming and weeping. 
And AGAIN the Marine emerges and dusts himself off.
Bewildered and pissed off, the Lt. sends all but his platoon Sgt. down and says 
""Eliminate the motherfu**er"". They run towards him and again follow him to the ridge. 
The screaming begins again and suddenly a specialist comes running up, 
bloody, his cammies all mangled. The Lt. is in shock and says 
""What the hell is going on out there soldier?"" 
Gasping for breath the soldier replies, 
""Its a trick sir!! There's two of em."""

"event","The chief of staff of the US Air Force decided that he would personally intervene in the recruiting crisis affecting all of our armed services. He directed a nearby Air Force base that will be opened and that all eligible young men and women be invited.

As he and his staff were standing near a brand new F-15 Fighter, a pair of twin brothers who looked like they had just stepped off a Marine Corps recruiting poster walked up to them. The chief of staff walked up to them, stuck out his hand and introduced himself.

He looked at the first young man and asked, ""Son, what skills can you bring to the Air Force?""

The young man looks at him and says, ""I'm a pilot!""

The general gets all excited, turns to his aide and says, ""Get him in today, all the paper work done, everything, do it!""

The aide hustles the young man off. The general looks at the second young man and asked, ""What skills to you bring to the Air Force?""

The young man says, ""I chop wood!""

""Son,"" the general replies, ""we don't need wood choppers in the Air Force, what do you know how to do?""

""I chop wood!""

""Young man,"" huffs the general, ""you are not listening to me, we don't need wood choppers, this is the 20th century!""

""Well,"" the young man says, ""you hired my brother!""

""Of course we did,"" says the general, ""he's a pilot!""

The young man rolls his eyes and says, ""Dang it, I have to chop it before he can pile it!"""

"event","Even sparklers, which burn as hot as 1200 degrees F (649 C), cause thousands of injuries to children each year. 

Attend professional displays and leave fireworks to the technicians who are trained to use them. 

The best way to enjoy fireworks is to visit public fireworks displays put on by professionals who know how to safely handle fireworks. 

If you plan to use fireworks, make sure they are legal in your area. 

Never light fireworks indoors or near dry grass. 

Always have a bucket of water and/or a fire extinguisher nearby. Know how to operate the fire extinguisher properly. 

Do not wear loose clothing while using fireworks. 

Stand several feet away from lit fireworks. If a devise does not go off, do not stand over it to investigate it. Put it out with water and dispose of it. 

Always read the directions and warning labels on fireworks. If a devise is not marked with the contents, direction and a warning label, do not light it. 

Supervise children around fireworks at all times. 

Spectators should obey all ushers or monitors and respect the safety barriers set up to allow the trained operator room to safely do his job. Resist any temptation to get close to the actual firing site. In fact, the best view of the fireworks is from a quarter of a mile or more away. 

Although it rarely happens, it is possible that a firework component might fall to the ground without exploding. The public should be cautioned not to touch these fireworks. If they happen to find any which have not exploded, they should immediately contact the local fire or police department. 

Pets have very sensitive ears and the booms and bangs associated with a fireworks display can be quite uncomfortable -- particularly to dogs. In fact, the noises can actually hurt their ears. Leave pets at home if you are going to a fireworks show. 

Leave the lighting of all fireworks to the trained operator when you attend a public display. Sparklers, fountains and other items that many states allow for use by private individuals are not appropriate to use when a large crowd is present. Leave your own fireworks at home -- the display will provide plenty of excitement."

"event","Alpine has now affected every aspect of my life.  I can no longer do any work after about 9 o'clock at night.  But, I get up early every morning and am really focased and can get stuff done.  I'm trying to figure out if this is a good thing or a bad thing.  I'm still weighing the pros and cons and whatnot.  I never get any sleep because I have class all the livelong day, but my homework gets much more attention.  And I never do have to do anything at night.  Well I think that the moral of the story is that my class/work schedule sucks.

I've definatley gotten addicted to the Old 97's album ""Hitchhike to Rhome"".  It was suggested to me by Matt Kilgoer (misspelled purposely and he knows why).  It has a lot of really good songs on it.  But, it has some absolutely terrible songs on it.  This makes me irritated because I've always felt that I can't really respect an artist as much if they put out crapy albums.  The Old 97's have put out some crapy albums with wonderful songs on them.  This album is not very good at all but has a lot of gems on it.  All in all I guess that I recomend it.  So, get it.  Now.

So, tomorrow it will be a week until my birthday.  I've never been a big fan of birthdays.  Never.  But for some reason I really do want to do something for my birthday.  Nothing crazy.  I don't feel too crazy anymore.  I'm becoming really laid back in everything that I do.  I just want an extremely relaxing day.  And it's my twenty-first birthday, so the natural inclanation(not spelled right) that people think is that I'll go out and have a drink.  But I don't really want to do that.  I just want to hang out with my friends.  Something very relaxed.  Maybe just invite a bunch of people over an watch a movie or play music or just sit around and listen to music.  I don't know.  Well, if you've made it this far in reading this entry then you're invited to join the celebration.  Nothing big though.  Me and birthdays have issues so we can't have any of that."

Nothing like that ever happens a Millsaps.  Though last night was a much needed break from reality, it really makes me think about what I'm missing in my college experience.  All of my friends are having the time of their lives at school and I'm not.  I just study a lot and make bad grades.  They all skip class, never do any work, and make really good grades.  It's too late to do anything about it now.  All I can do is sit back and hope I didn't make a decision that is cutting short my life of what it couldv'e been.  Go Majors."

I've been down to the gulf a couple times but I've only been over to the beach one day.  People are always jealous of me because I live at the beach but yet I hardly ever go down there.  I guess if you lived at the beach you would know what its like.  This is probably getting boring by now so goodbye and have a good summer.  I'll post again when I get back.

So this post is coming to you from the Millsaps-Wilson Library folks.  I've been in here since I woke up this morning.  I'll probably be here until they kick me out at 2.

So, I found out from Casey that I got first and second best picture of the year from the newspaper staff.  I find that hilarious.  I really don't a thing about cameras except that I have one.  They tell me I take the most creative pictures and stuff like that.  Well, if you say so.  Casey is also giving my two couches a summer home.  Thank you Casey.  Now I don't have to haul those things back home.  I told my dad that we didn't have to bring the couches home and he said that was the best thing I've done since I've been in college.  When I told him about the intramural man of the year he said he thought it was a mistake.  He didn't respond to the best picture deal.  I guess he figured I was just making all this stuff up at this point."

I worked really hard to do all the stuff I did and I would like to thank anyone who was on any Blue Can team.  Also, I debuted the banjo tonight at MCF.  It was awsome.  Everyone enjoyed it.  When we were practicing beforehand, everyone was really excited with how it was sounding.  So, I guess I get the invite for next year then.

I want to start working on some more music this summer.  And I'm not talking about trying to do the whole singer/songwriter deal.  I want to make music that I would want to listen to.  So, I've been formulating this idea in my head of this laid back bluegrass/folk sounding music.  Very earthy.  Like something straight out of the mountains.  There probably won't be many lyrics associated with this.  It's going to take some work though.  And a recording device of some kind.  I want to play all the instraments myself.  So the money I make this summer will probably go towards recording equipment.  I want something that will handle more than just four tracks, because there is a lot of stuff I would like to put into this.  I'm really glad I decided that I wanted to do this.  That is the type of music that I really enjoy.  Maybe if there is any money left after the recording equipment, I can find a used mandolin.  I have no idea how much either of them cost.  The mandolin is definatley next in line on the list of Bahen's instraments.  And I would really love to be able to play the dulcimer.  I think that's how you spell it.  Probably not though.  I'll probably need to pick up some small precusion stuff too.  This is big stuff.  Maybe I can find a job next semester to help further finace all this stuff.  I will be working as a lab assistant so that will be a little cash.  What would be really great is if I could get some friends to help me out on some of the stuff.  Like get someone to do piano or fiddle.  A fiddle would be awsome.  Man, I gotta stop writting on this and get back to work."

On second thought, that comment about the naked devil could cause controversy as well.  So, discuss that too.  Now.  Or not.  Whatever I probably won't read it anyway.

Today was all about some Bahen in the Purple and White.  They published my letter to the editor that I wrote about how much the article on the sports page sucked.  Then, they had a picture of me enjoying the tunes of Alexander's Dark Heart at Earthfest.  I'm starting to feel like an Alexander's Dark Heart groupie.  I'm cool with that.  Alexander's Dark Heart groupies need to have a cool name though.  Like Heartheads.  But that sounds too wussy for the tough hardcore stylings of the likes of this band.  Maybe I shouldn't go about naming stuff like this.  This might make the band mad.  I'm starting to get the feeling that they don't like me following them.  I keep yelling for them to play Free Bird and they don't play it.  And Walter caught me stealing his underwear.  That was really embaressing.  And Jim told me that I was the worst thing to ever happen to this band and that I can't read good.  And Roy stole one of my shoelaces.  I keep telling them that if they need a banjo solo in one of their songs that I'm down.  No word yet.  No word yet."

We also talked about me going up to visit him after I'm done with school.  I would get to see Will too. And plus, since he works for Jo Bonner then he can get me into some places that the normal tourist can not get too.  He said it takes anywhere from 15 to 19 hours to get there from Mobile.  You go up I-65 to Montgomery and get on I-85 which goes up through Atlanta and all up that way.  Then you get on like I-95 maybe.  I don't remember.  Also, while I'm up there I can drive up to New Jersey to see Haley and Jerry.  I'm really excited about the trip.

I'm learning ""Here Comes the Sun"" on the guitar right now.  It's an extremely interesting song now that I'm learning it.  I don't know why I decided to learn it but I've been saying that more and more lately on my song memorization choices.  One of the people in the play brought her guitar to play before the show.  She let me play it and I impressed Guidry with the few Lucero songs that I knew.  Striking the set wasn't too much fun.  I had to go up to the very top of the theater, above the fly loft, and move weights.  Not fun.  They are finishing up tomorrow so I'm going to go by after class and help.  I paid for the banquet today too.  I'm all set.  Oh, and some people mentioned to me about how I had enough shows now to get into the theater honorary society.  That would be really cool.

Everyone was over at my grandmother's house.  Sunday we went to Church for Easter then went back down to the gulf to have dinner with the family.  I drove straight from Gulf Shores back to Jackson.  I went up Hwy 59 instead of going back through Fairhope.  I think that shorten my drive about 15 to 20 minutes.  Monday night I played my banjo with some folks.  I kept up pretty well.  I think I'm ready to play in front of people with it now.  Yesterday, I went to go take pictures of the play for the newspaper.

Friday, I'm going to watch Alexander's Dark Heart in the bowl at 1:00 and then playing intramural ultimate at 2:00.  If you want to play intramural ultimate with us let me know.  Anyone is welcome.  Oh, and next weekend I'm going to be in Poplarville to play in a two day disc golf tournament.  And this Saturday I'm going to Hattiesburg and I might potentially see Chay while I'm down there.

Yes doing fun and exciting stuff you can tell people about is great, but it can't be done all the time.  People would get sick of listening to stories.

I wrote another song between classes.  It's alright.  It's got words and music and is complete so I can't complain.  It's more than most of my songs have.  I think its cool that I'm writing this on hear because now I have a record of when I wrote certain songs.  That's nice to have.

I went to MCF tonight.  They played 4 really good songs that I like.  To bad Lauren didn't come because they played Be Thou My Vision.  We went over Luke 14.  It's good stuff.  I talked to Beau about some things.  Also, I gave about a hundred different people my number.  Crazy.  You can only hope that stuff like that doesn't come back to haunt you.  Not that I think it will but its crazy all the same.  Me and Chuck are going to have lunch tomorrow instead of Wednesday.  Me and Chip set up a time to have lunch next week.  I gave Drew his sunglasses back that he left in my car.  It was quite the event.

So, the day was good.  I know it doesn't sound like it from what I've written but it means something to me.  And plus I've probably left out a bunch of stuff.  Oh, I won 4 consecutive games of Vegas solitaire today.  That was pretty cool.  I don't think I've ever done that before.  I won the first one and thought to myself, ""that would be cool if I won again.""  And it happened.  And then I repeated the cycle and I just kept winning.  Except for the fifth time.  I didn't win.  Oh well.  What can you do?"

I read the first six chapters of the Book of Luke tonight.  Good stuff.  I need to do much more reading.  Among other things.  I'd like the read Walden in its entirety.  And I really need to finally read Mere Christianity.  I want to reread Heart of Darkness too.  There are a couple of plays I want to read too.  The rereading Waiting for Godot will can be included in that list.  I need to start working out too.  I really need to make a decision on the football thing.  Regardless, I really need to start working out again.  Being in shape was so great.  And now I'm not.  I just always felt good when I was in shape.  Something needs to be done.

I went climbing at MC this weekend with DT.  It felt really good to do that again.  I was doing awsome.  DT was really impressed with my climbing ability.  We ran into Beau there.  I need to go back.  It was good exercise.  I want to try the wall without holds.  I need to see when Mike goes.

MCF tomorrow.  Three days till the break.  I can make it.  I can."

"event","Bryce calls me up today on his phone and tells me that he beat my best score on the Fairhope disc golf course.  My best score was 4 over and he shot a 2 over.  Granted that I don't play Fairhope much, that's really amazing.  That's not something you want to hear.  My 14 year old brother beat me.  I'm going to swallow my pride and say it:  he is a better athlete than I am.  It's true.  Dad was a really good athlete and so is Bryce.  The only thing is that I am so much more competative than Bryce.  He doesn't care at all.  Me on the other hand, I'm ready to kill someone when I'm competing against them.  If he keeps shooting like that then he'll have to move up to the division that I'm in.  That's scary.  I would have to compete againt my brother in tournaments.  What if he beats me.  I would have to listen to that the whole way home.  And if he beat me next weekend in Baton Rouge then I would have to listen to that for 3 hours on the way back.  Man.  I should've never got him into disc golf.

I drove down to Wesson to play disc golf today.  I wanted to play a course that didn't have people as obstacles.  I didn't play very well and I lost a disc in the water.  I need to make it up to Holmes County now to play that course.  I just need pratice for next weekend.  Well I guess this entire post is going to be about disc golf because I don't feel like writing anymore.  Oh, the Strawberry Festival was cool.  We went to New Orleans afterward.  Anyway, I'm tired so night."

But anyway, it was a lot of fun and I had a great time.  Me and Tom got into arguments in front of everyone and it was pretty funny.  I had a good time.

I played disc golf today.  I shot even on the front nine.  I didn't play the back.  I played with Andrew T., Andrew L., and a guy named Brandon.  It was fun.  Brandon is really good.  He plays advanced.  I've lost my turnover shot.  I need to get out there more and do a lot of work.  My game is constantly changing.  I need more disc to practice with.  I need to do well in the Baton Rouge tournament so I can get some discs.  Yeah, me and Bryce are definatley going to the Baton Rouge tournament on April 10th.  We will drive over that Friday, play the course, then find a place to stay.  We will probably get a hotel room.  I'm really excited.  I'll get to play with Bobby again.

I'm going to the Strawberry Festival tomorrow.  I'm not quite sure what its all about but me, Drew, Kilgore, and Carter are going.  I'm driving.  Hopefully it will be fun.  I'll let you know if it is."

I went and ate at Keifers tonight with Anthony, Anthony's Old South date (I don't know her name), Major, Alex, Yale, and Yale's girlfriend (once again the name thing).  So basically I was the only one who wasn't a KA.  I find that really cool.  I feel accepted.  I consider myself to be good friends with all the KA's my year.  Or at least the ones I know.  After that I went and watched tv in Yale's room.  They were watching south park and I told myself that I would stay until I saw something that offended me.  Well, something did offend me so I got up and left.

Then I hung out with Claire, Mabry, and Sarah Ann.  We discussed the sham wedding with Judy and Ted.  I asked Sarah Ann if she would be my date to the wedding.  We decided that she needs to come with a pillow under her dress and stand up and stand up in the middle of the wedding and say they can't be married because she has Ted's baby.  That would be really really funny.  Then me, Roy, and Sarah Ann went to Wendys.  That about brings me up to present.  Not a bad day.  I'm going to have lunch with Chuck again tomorrow.  As always I'm looking forward to it.  I hope tomorrow is as nice as today was."

I went for a drive tonight.  I just needed to get away.  I've got some stuff on my mind.  I drove all around the northwest portion of the city of Jackson.  It needed to be done.  I came back and wrote a song.  It hit what I was feeling but it has a very poppy feel to it.  I don't know.  Its a song.  I popped a string on the new banjo.  I had an extra pack though.  I always try to have an extra pack of strings on me.  Except for the bass.  Those things will never pop and they are too expensive.  If one does break then I will get new ones.  But until then, my money is staying in my wallet.

We didn't have enough people for softball today.  I wasn't surprized.  Wednesday we will have enough.  I have faith that I can get eight people to show.  This comps thing is killing my numbers.  Whatever.  We'll just see how things turn out."

"event","Ok get this.  I'm in this disc golf tournament this past Saturday and for the first round I shot a -5.  That's ridiculous.  That's a personal record of lowest score ever attained.  That score was good enough to give me first place in my division if the tournament had only been one round.  But alas, a typical disc golf tournament is two or more rounds.  Round 2 score: +10.  Yeah.  That's a fifteen shot difference.  I didn't even win anything which meant that over half of my division shot better than me.  Wow.  I was winning the thing and completely blew up.  Bryce won the junior division though.  That was really cool.  It was his first tournament to ever play in and he won his division.  We went and played today after church, before I left to come back to Jackson.  We both played terrible.

I got my banjo this weekend.  Its awsome.  I love it.  I got it all tuned up when I got back to my room and played it all night.  I got the hang of it pretty quickly.  There is still a lot of learning to be done on it though.  Then Lauren came by and I started playing it for her and letting her try it out.  Then Huffy came by and brought his big standup bass.  So then, with me on banjo, Huffy on bass, and Lauren on guitar, we played Amazing Grace.  It sounded really good.  Om, Tom, and Andrew came by and watched.  It was a whole lot of fun.  It was the first jamming I got to do on the banjo.  Cool stuff.

My weekend was great.  I got to spend time with the family.  And it was absolutly beautiful down there.  The weather was warm and sunny.  The azaleas and the dogwoods were in bloom.  It was worth the trip.  Now I'm stuck here till Easter.  Oh well.  Live life and have fun.  That's what its all about.  Don't ever let anyone stop you from having the time of your life.

Neither team had enough players to play soccer this afternoon.  There were four of us and and four of them.  It was me Charley, DT, and Mabry, and we decided that we would scrimage for fun.  Wow.  I ran so much.  That was like big time adventures in excerise with host lambda chis.  I have a feeling that I'm going to be too sore to walk tomorrow.  But that's ok.  My 8:30 got cancelled.  So no class for Bahen tomorrow.  This semester has been the semester of class cancelations.  I don't know why come but I do know that I like it.

Had lunch with Chuck today.  We ate at Roosters.  I had a great time.  He offered to help me come up with good topics to do devotionals on this summer.  He said we could get together and go over so Bible verses that would go well with children.  I don't think he realizes how much that would help me out.  I played disc golf before I met him for lunch.  I shot one over on nine holes.  Not bad but could be better.  If I would've had time to play the back I know that I would've gone under par.  The back nine is so easy.  The whole course is easy compared to every other course you'll ever play.  Hopefully, the Pensacola course is as easy as this one and I'll do really well in the tournament.  Ok, wishfull thinking, but hey can you blame me.  I need to make a desent showing in a tournament.  I've been playing terrible in them.  Oh well.  Better luck tomorrow.  I know I'll have time to play."

I've been feeling much happier as of late.  I don't know why.  I don't know if I really needed spring break at home or if its something to do with all these changes I'm trying to make with my life but I really do feel better.  Shoot, it could be all this exercise I've been getting.  It could be all the new people I've let into my life.  It could be that I've pushed a lot of people out of my life.  I don't know but I feel happy.  It's been a long time since I've felt happy for no reason at all.  Could this be a sign of good things to come?  Well, lets not be unhealthily optimistic.  We all know, or should know, that looking too deep into things is never good.  Got that?  Good.

We lost to the pikes in soccer today.  That wasn't fun.  We play the lambda chis wednesday at 5.  Come out and watch us.  We play at the practice field.  Its fun times.  Also I need to get together a mens intramural softball team.  If you want to play let me know.  The meeting is like wednesday or thursday or someday like that.  I should probably find that out.  Oh well.  Ultimate tournament is postponed.  I know, all these intramural changes.  I've been looking forward to this tournament though.  But now I can go home for the weekend and play in the disc golf tournament in Pensacola.  The park is actually west of Pensacola and not too far from my house.  Its like less than an hour drive on some country back roads.  I'll miss the Dirty Dozen Brass Band but they come through Mobile a lot so.  I'm not a big fan of school sponsered concerts anyway.  In fact the only one I've been to is the North MS Allstars.  I love them too much to miss them though.

Me and Joseph went over tonight about how we need to do a lot of practicing before the possible gig.  I'm feeling pretty confindent that we'll get it.  That's probably not a good sign.  I really want to play though.  A lot.  Well at least right now I do.  It would be a lot of fun and only good things could come from it.

So, I guess this is the part where you tell about everything you did today.  Well, if you don't mind, I think that I'll do that.  I was at home for spring break in the 'hope and got up this morning and me and my little brother went and played disc golf.  I didn't play too well.  I only hit one birdie.  But what can you do.  Good days and bad.  Then I drove home.  I make it sound so simple.  Let me get this straight right off the bat:  Jackson to Mobile = not a fun drive.  Especially when you've got no air condition.  So I had my windows down and the music up really loud.  And on the way up I kept passing all these Southern Miss people heading back to school from the beach.  It was pretty cool because the road was just full of college kids yelling back and forth at each other.  I pull up next to some frat guys and start talking to them or I'd pull next to a car of freshly tanned girls and wave at them just to see the entire car wave back at me.  It makes me wish that I had done something fun for spring break besides go home.  I know, I know, I just called Fairhope, Alabama not fun but somebody had to do it.  

So when I got back to Jackson, I went to 6:00 church across the street at first pres.  The sermon was on Mark 2 and 3 and it was pretty good.  Then later on tonight, me, Huffy, and Andrew had an impromtu jam session in my room.  Impromtu jam sessions in my room seem to be becoming more frequent.  Huffy played my bass and Andrew played my harmonicas.  Sure, things could've sounded much better but it was fun.  Oh and Trey said he was going to talk to someone about a gig for spring parties.  It would be fun to play at the KA house.  I haven't been over there in a while but I might start going over there more with Major.  We talked about it over spring break.

Anyway, that was the day of Bahen.  Roll Tide by the way.  Sweet 16.  Took out No.1 seed Standford.  Make way because the tide is coming through.  Roll Tide."

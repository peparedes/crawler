I had a work meeting in Telford yesturday and had to get the damn train...didn't get back to brum till about 17:30. And it's a good job it was yesturday, as today trees have been blown over on the rail lines and loads of people are stranded or having to get public buses. Its so windy! 
I'm at Anastasia's at the min...was having a chat and she just offered if i wanted to use the comp. She's gone out now though. Our cooker has messed up so we need a new one for the flat...we've only just got a new fridge freezer so Anastasia must be ""loving us"" right now lol-bless. Did i mention we finally got rid of our small TV out of the livingroom, and now we gots a widescreen?? Its heaven!!! i don't have to squint my eyes anymore to watch it!

In other news, Hayley has an eye infection (poor baby)...so i'll be nursing her till she gets better *smerks* ;)
Hayley's family came over at the weekend because it was her mum's birthday. As they were leaving her lil brother Adam wouldn't give her a hug and came out with a reply ""it's not your birthday you know"". So i said ""well i'm not family , so do i get a hug?""...i didnt get one but i was told i could have one for my birthday next month lol. But however!! Hayleys mum replied with ""don't say that...your part of the family now...we've adopted you!"" and kept repeating ""your part of the family now"" and stuffs heheh. Made me feel good because as yal know...me and Hayleys mum never used to get along so great...now i always get a ""crushing hug"" when they come over :)

This weekend i have the joys of moving my old fridge freezer to a house next door, up a flight of stairs...i'll be expecting a back massage afterwards lol.
(Hayley's response ""will you now!!!"" ...my reply *cheeky grin*)

So that's it guys...as before...i don't know when i'll next be online so i'll reply to any emails/posts etc as soon as i can.

Love yas! xxx"

Don't tell me what's on you're mind
I'll continue to carry on blind
Although you believe you're being kind
You're actually leaving me behind
That one person i hold close
Should be able to talk to me the most
Yet i fade...

Becoming this ghost
Eventually you'll hate me most
And i'll always be the last to know
What you feel, what emotions show
Fear the person that now you see
This former shadow...
Of you and me"

"event","I'm bored....Hayley is away tonight stayin at a friends and i'm missing her lots. Normally i'm alright...smoking takes up some of the time and what not...Now because i'm in the process of quitting theres all that spare time im not using up now and it's making my days drag. And obviously i'm getting all the side effects i normally get when i try and quit...short temper, enhanced mood swings, depression, and not knowing what to say. On several occassions while i've been tryin to quit ive gone online n people are chattin n i'm just sat staring blankly at the screen. I'll be asked a question and give a one word answer or none...n ive been goin online through bordom when really i just have nothing to say. Everyones like ""you ok?""...well yeah i guess i am ok given the situation, as this is normally what happens when i quit cold turkey. Theres never a good time to quit as there is always something stressfull going on. and normally something happens to kick start me smoking again as i get agitated VERY quickly while quitting..so everyone, if i'm not with it the best advice i can give you is to back off...that way i can't lash out and also u cant piss me off in anyway. I've been smoking for over ten years...it has to stop now...so help me with it people *hugz*

I see hayley next saturday...i can't wait, i miss her so much. For my birthday it's only Hayley and Emma going now...i'm hoping nothing pops up to prevent them from coming cuz i know they wudnt let me down unless it was life or death. Both of their parents can be ""bitchy"" sometimes so i'm hoping they don't make hassel. If any of them cant make it i'll just cancel our plan cuz there'll be no point.
Nothing happened in concerns to the flat yet...i'm gonna call on monday if i hear nothing tomorrow.
In other news, just lately i'm becoming over-whelmingly aware that the majority of my ""friends"" are all ""take take take"" and no ""give"" so i've decided i'm not gonna be so generous anymore. Yes i know quite a lot of you are reading this but i don't care...you all know me well enough by now to know that i say what i think..n besides this is my journal n i'll write what i want so if yaz don't like it DONT read it. but for those of you who are reading it...you just take a moment now...and think...just how many times have i put myself out for you..even when really i shouldn't...for example im skint but i still keep my promise of doing something for yaz...how many times have i dropped my plans to spend time with yaz instead...how many times have i sat on the phone getting my ear bent and helped even tho i was either doing something important or watching my programmes! And now you think about just how many times you lot have let me down!! ""oh yeah i'll do this...i'll meet you here...i'll come visit you"" ...NO!!!!! you won't do that you'll give me an excuse...no YOU WON'T meet me there i get stood up, yet when u arange something i go...no YOU WON'T  come visit me because ""moneys tight this week"" or some other bullshit excuse..when really all you need to say is ""no your not imporatant enough to spend money out on""...d'yal think my money isn't tight as well and yet i put myself out. So you sit there and think long and good just about how many times you've done that to me n how many times i HAVENT done it to you...cuz if you all can't think of any i'm sure i could make a list for every single one of yaz. So lets get that clear ""friends""....i ain't puttin myself out for NONE OF YOU unless ya'll change your ways!!!!"

"event","Welps yeps, i know this is a lil late...but i've been so busy this week i just haven't had chance to update.

On the friday as i've mentioned, it was the works Christmas party and we had it at a club called ""the works"" which is on Broad street. I had a brilliant time...i went straight from work to meet up with my mates to go back to the hotel, jumped in the shower then got changed and went to my friends room. She straightend ma hair and what not n then we all left and stayed at the pub O'Neils for a little first. When we got there it was already in full swing even though the night was young...i was already tipsy at this stage because i'd been getting a head start at the hotel and knocked one back at O'Neils. I spend almost all night dancing away (they don't call me dancing girl for nothing-lol). I had 2 highlights of the evening. One was dancing with Toni Austin...anyone who talks to me should know that this is a girl i work with who is FUCKING GORGEOUS (lol)...n there she is shaking her ass up all on me i was like ""woooooooooooooooo shake it! *slaps ass*"" ROTFLMMFGDAO. Then we was country dancing to cottoneye joe...old classic hehehe. shes a sweetie. My second highlight of the evening was Helen someone else i used to work with, she was dancing with me...it was really funny cuz she kept goin to gimmie a kiss n i had to keep reminding her to give ""just a peck helen!!!"" LMAO. She had a really low cut dress on so i was like *wink*""love the dress chick""...n shes like ""got a good look yet?"" then she pulled ma head down on em like a pillow...crazy sod lmao. I was dancing with her and she knocked my glass of baileys flying so she bought me a double when she only knocked over a single...she insisted she got me another one though lol. The DJ game me a glue and a green glow light...so i was dancing around with them n then i put them down my shirt holding them in my bra while i danced...all u could see was this blue and green glow under my shirt hehehe. Anyways we all went back to the hotel about 2:30am...i had a bit more to drink then went to bed.

I woke up at 7:30 and got myself ready to go to burton to meet up with Hayley ....i was just a tad hungover ROTFLMAO. But yeah i got there and by the time id woke up properly i felt a lot better. Hayley has said what happened that day but yeah i'll run through it quick for those of you who don't read my babes journal. We meet up, got some dinner, then went to a visitor centre n i asked for a list of accomodation, but ended up booking the hotel while i was there. We went to the cinema after that to watch Narnia- the lion the witch and the warbrobe...then we checked in at the hotel around about 3pm. Then we did some ""catching up"" *wink wink* because we hadnt had any ""alone time"" together for a long time. But yeah...we spent the night ""catching up"" and cuddling....took a bath together (very nice bath that was too *winx*. Then we fell asleep in each others arms. I missed her so bad....i missed her even when she was right infront of me....But it felt so good to fall asleep in her arms. In the morning we checked out around 11am...we went and got something to eat and then we went to the cinema again and watched King Kong. Time flew from there and the next thing i knew i was waving her off in a taxi and i was catching a coach back to birmingham as the trains weren't running. We had an amazing weekend though...and we're definately gonna have to do it again some time.

In other news...tomorrow it'll be mine n hayleys 1 year aniversary....i CANT believe shes put up with me for so long...and yet the time has flew...doesnt feel like a year at all...and we are so much closer and stronger...and everythings still perfect...we've never argued once (only playfully)...and ...and...i dunno...shes just amazin and i'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers unless she tells me to go.

I love you Hayley!!"

"event","Well as you can see from my last entry i took the hurdle of telling my older bro about my sexuality. I sat thinking about it last night...and i finally decided i'm not gonna put it off any longer...i have to tell my mum. So i wrote a letter lastnight and posted it today...which means she'll get it in the morning...and it is a COMPLETE understatement when i say that im ROYALLY FUCKING SHITTING MYSELF!!! Anyway, this is what i wrote...

Mum,
You're probably wondering why i'm writing to you when you're a phone call away. Well truth is, i need to tell you something...and i'm too much of a chicken to tell you to your face. Maybe you already guessed, but still, i'd rather you hear it from me rather than someone else if you haven't.
I'm bi, and i prefer to be with women. I've wanted to tell you for a long time, but i didn't know how you'd react and i just didn't have the bottle. If you're not happy about it then please take into consideration how long it's taken me myself to accept it. i needed to tell you though because you'd find out sooner or later, and i don't want to pretend to be something i'm not. Telling you this is probably the hardest thing i've ever had to do, so please let me know how you feel about this.
Erin x"

"event","Welps...as most of yaz know everyone knows im bi...apart from my older bro andrew and my mum. Now i've only gotta tell mum as ive just told my older bro. i knew he'd be kewl about it but thats not the point. There was only hima nd mum left to tell so telling him was a HUGEEEEEEEEEEEEEE step for me. So peeps this is how it went :


Ezza: ellos

takenocolor: hello. quake 4 is fucking cool

Ezza: u got it then?

takenocolor: yeh, already clocked it last night

Ezza: kewl you'll av to show us sometimes

takenocolor: yeh, if you pop over this weekend again i can show ya

Ezza: yeah anyways, reason i messaged is...i know you prob already know cuz i know yah aint stupid...but i reckon yah shud hear it from me considering ive told pretty much everyone else apart from you and mum. im bi...n its prob obvious i like girls more....n ur prob wondering why ive said it out of the blue but to be quite honest never really is a good way to bring up the subject so i thought id just say it

Ezza: k

Ezza: n i aint told mum yet cuz i havent got a clue how she'd react so i'll tell her in my own time...so please dont say anything

takenocolor: hope you know i ain't gonna hold it against ya at all Erin :)

Ezza: yeah i know...i just thought yah shud know...i mean..i dont go out of ma way to hide it...thats why i said u prob knew...n the fact when we had an arguement that once n you decided to shout ""lemon licker"" at the top of ur voice....well...enough said ROTFLMAO

takenocolor: lol

takenocolor: well thanks for having the courage to tell me. i wont say anything to anyone else - its not my place to, so i aint gonna let it out to mom

Ezza: but yeah...i have a gf...n we've been together for 10 months today. dad and shaz have known about it for ages...but i aint told them bout hayley because theres an age difference n i dont think they'd aprove

Ezza: hayley turned 16 last tuesday...she dunt act her age tho

takenocolor: well if they didn't approve they'd be hypocrites - i'm 4 years older than Laura, and dad is well older than Sharon

Ezza: n its not that i aint gonna tell them...its just that for the time being its my business and not theres...yah know?

takenocolor: yeh

Ezza: yeah i know...i think they disapproved more of ma last gf

Ezza: she was 26 LMAO

takenocolor: they shouldn't disapprove at all

takenocolor: none of their business anyways

Ezza: ma last gf got my name tattooed on her arm...and i can tell when sumats not rigth n i had a feeling she was cheatin on me...so i did a lil ""research""...she said she was living in brum with her dad when really she was living in huddersfield with another woman the stupid bitch...but yeah...shes the stupid cow that got ma name tattooed on her LMAO

takenocolor: lol

Ezza: lol

Ezza: only thing to do now is tell me...ive wanted to for ages jus dunno how to tho...guess i'll find a way

Ezza: mum*

takenocolor: i know this aint gonna help, but i dont bullshit - i'm telling it how i see it....i honestly have no fucking idea how mom would take it

Ezza: i know...thats my problem as well

takenocolor: i reckon she'd be alright with it though

takenocolor: but im not 100%

Ezza: i can normally guess how sumone will take it...but when it comes to mum...i aint got a clue

Ezza: which is why i havent said anythin up to now

Ezza: n i knwo it aint a phase because ive known since i was like 5 concidering first crush i had was on a girl in sims cross and i used to try run around playin catch and kiss and chase her LMAO

takenocolor: Sharon copied the new BoC album when i came over yesterday. just so you know, she wants the other two albums you've buried in your room back

takenocolor: lol

Ezza: lmao okies

"event","Well as you know, i had a very shitty holiday...And i started back at work on the Monday to have my manager call me over for a ""quiet chat"". He told me that i could lose my job at the end of this month or the beginning of the next because the building will probably be getting rid of all temporary staff due to the low volumes of work coming through. Its been a risk for the past couple of months now so i knew this conversation was gonna happen sooner or later. But he did bring me some good news though...he told me there was permanent jobs going on a different floor in the building and would i be interested in applying for it. I had a look at it...n said yeah, so he filled in everythin for me n sent it off monday afternoon...i didn't even have to do a thing. Apparently he said there was an opening day for it while i was on holiday so obviously i couldn't go to it...n i was worried that i'd have a lot of competition trying for the position as there was only 20 jobs going. But yeah...so i got an email on thursday telling me i had a telephone interview on friday at 1pm. At the minute ive been moved to s different floor anyway with all of the other temp staff and a lot of them where annoyed that id got an interview before them as they applied before me...so i was pretty pleased...

Friday came...my manager coached me for the interview for an hour at 10am...he even booked me a meeting room so i could take the call with no distractions- none of the other managers did that for their staff. anyway, by the time id got back to my desk there was a few people who had already had their interviews, so i asked them what kind of questions they was asking and if they told them when they'd find out if they'd been successful and made it to the face to face interviews. They was told to wait 2-5 working days to find out.

12:30...the interview was approaching and i was shitting it...im much better face to face than what i am on the phone...but because id made a shitload of notes based on what my manager had told me and also the questions my friends told me where being asked i felt pretty confident...just very nervous. So i went to the toilet, then got a drink..n by the time i got to the meeting room my manager had left his work just to come and giv me some support...hes a great manager and if i get the job i'll miss my old group a lot...we're all really close.
Anywayyyyyyyyyy ...he talked to me right up until the phone rang and i answered it...he gave me the thumbs up on how i'd answered the phone and then left. 

It was a woman...she told me the interview would take 25 to 30 mins and that there may be a short silence after ive given each answer as she needs to type my replies and make sure she has everything. Also that there would be 3 sections of questions and that i should go on my first instinct and not take long in thinking of my replies. This made me nervous because i had to give my answers quickly. I said ""just before we start, i've had some problems with my phone network is it possible to give you another number just incase we should get cut off?""..so its a good job i did that....because Hayley sent me a text message half way into the interview and it cut off the call LOL! she was askin me how it went bless but i hadn't actually finished lol. But yeah...the woman called me back and i must of completely blew her away with my answers (not being big headed but i thought i fuckin rocked with the answers i was giving her)..and she must of been impressed because she said ""ok thanx alot for that Erin i have no more questions to ask...and you'll be pleased to know you've been successful up to this stage. I'm just gonna put you on hold while i see if we have the info on the face to face interviews""....n she came back n apologized because she didn't have the details yet, so she said she'd call me early next week and let me know dates etc. and that was that. 

Well i had the biggest grin on my face...i got back to my desk and everyone was like ""how did it go""...by the end of the day almost everyone had had their interview...and out of all of them...i was THE ONLY ONE who was told straight away on the phone that i'd made it to the next stage....everyone else was told to wait 2-5 working days to find out. Can you imagine how amazin that made me feel? I musta been smilling like a cheshire cat all day lol!!!

So yeps, im pleased about that...i'll let everyone know what else happens"

(If you've got love in your sights
Watch out, love bites)

When you make love, do you look in the mirror?
Who do you think of?
Does he look like me?
Do you tell lies, and say that it's forever?
Do you think twice, or just touch and see?
Ooh, Babe
Ooh, yeah

When you're alone, do you let go?
Are you wild and willing or is it just for show?
Oooh, c'mon

I don't wanna touch you too much, Baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it

No!
(Love bites, love bleeds)
It's bringin' me to my knees
(Love lives, love dies)
It's no surprise
(Love begs, love pleads)
It's what I need

When I'm with you, are you somewhere else?
Am I gettin' through, or do you please yourself?
When you wake up, will you walk out?
It can't be love, if you throw it about
Oooh, Babe

I don't wanna touch you too much, Baby
'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy

Oh!
(Love bites, love bleeds)
It's bringin' me to my knees
(Love lives, love dies)
It's no surprise
(Love begs, love pleads)
It's what I need

Oooh, yeah

Yes it does
It will be hell)"

~Life~

Run away hide
Swallow your pride
Rollercoaster inside
Taking you for a ride

Life becomes tired
Body too expired
Wasting so much time
With what isn't required

_____________________________________________________________________

~Desire~

Listen...hear it not?
The fire within me so hot
You give that gentle kiss
Hands wonder to my hips

Wild fevered thoughts rush
And i surrender to your touch
The magic of this bliss
With shorter pause between each kiss

Not a second must we waste
As my arms slip round your waist
All pain and fear has gone
Now our bodys become one

Mighty gasps of air
As you bring me oh so near
In your arms it feels so right
Darling hold me through the night"

"event","I've decided i can't put it off any longer....i've gotta go visit my mum, and i'm going at the weekend on friday after work. I really really don't wanna go...but i have to. Mums been askin me when i'm gonna visit again for ages, and so has Christopher. 
I was talking to them on Tuesday at work, mum put Chris on the phone n he said ""when are you coming? n when can i come to birmingham u said i could!!""....i silently cried as i said ""i'll come over this weekend if you like""...he was so excited...and i was petrified regreting i'd said it as soon as i had. I would bring him here if i could because before i moved here dad and Sharon said it would be ok to have him over sometimes...but of course they've gone back on their word..just like with a lot of the stuff they said before i moved here. 

I don't want them to feel like i'm not visiting because i don't wanna see them...i do...i really miss them...i don't let on how much moving affected me...that was my life...it was all i'd ever known...my friends....my family. I just couldn't stand the pain anymore...there was too many bad memories...too much getting used by my friends who only wanted to see me when they felt like it or when they wanted something....too many arguements with my family. I couldn't stand it.

I knew leaving would be hard...but i knew living here would be just as hard too. I didn't feel wanted at all back at my mums....dad and sharon ""tricked"" me into feeling wanted..which soon disappeared once i'd actually moved in...i just knew it would be hard because i don't know my dad...i never have and i never will. No matter how hard i try to get close to him it never works. I can't even hold a simple conversation with him...it lasts for less than a minute n then we just sit there with an awkard silence. As for Sharon....all shes been doing for the past couple of months is make me feel bad about myself. Making sarcastic comments that just degrade me and put me down all the time. Lately shes doing it with absolutely anything i say. Just making me feel like nothing...worthless...maybe i am...but she doesn't have to rub it in!! i don't need someone to tell me i'm worthless....i have a fucking mirror for that. I can't even say anything about it...i know it'd just get turned on me to make me look like i'm the one getting the wrong end of the stick by taking things too much to heart, or instead there would be a huge arguement and i'd have nowhere to go...because i definately can't go back to Widnes, not even if i wanted to, not now. 

I feel so alone right now....i am alone. I know i have friends online and what not that will say they are there for me...and i know they are....its just not the same though is it. I wake up...i go to work...i come home to Sharon making me feel like shit and my dad just sat quiet...go to my room...stay there all night, either just listening to music...watchin tv, or chatting on here....then i sleep. Its pathetic...im pathetic. I'm just a prisoner in my room all over again..alone with nothing.

I can't stop thinking about going to visit mum though, and everytime i do i just cry. I dunno what i'ma do if i see him there...i seriously don't want to go, despite the fact that i do really wanna see my mum and Chris.
I'm so lost right now :("

"event","Well as most will know (i think)....me and Mandy are back on speaking terms im glad to say....Even though if i'm honest i'm still very hurt by what was said...i think its gonna take me quite a while to get over that, but i'm not one to actually let it ""get in the way"" of starting to put things right, if that makes sense to anyone at all.

I'd like to tell you all apart from that everythings ok...and that i'm ok...but in reality i know im not. Over the last couple of weeks i've been on edge...desperate to do something stupid...i nearly did a few times. Took a few tablets, like about 6 or something at a time....then stopped...knowing i can't take anymore...all though a big part of me wanted to. Just enough to numb the pain for a little while...even though my stomach is severely damaged from past experiences so it isn't doing me any good anyway. I know in my heart though i could never do that to Hayley...she means to much to me to leave behind. I'd like to say i wouldn't do it because of losing family but i'd be lying. Right now and for quite a while Hayley has been the single most important person in my life, which is why i have to make it through this. I have to stay strong for her.

I'm not a perfect person as she seems to think...i make mistakes and continue to do so everyday, and for this i only have myself to blame...hopefully i'll find the strength to be stronger and learn by my experiences so i don't find myself walking a ""wrong path""...and hopefully when i have kids of my own i can show them not to go wrong in situations where i have.

I've had a lot of time on my hands to think lately....it seems all i can bring myself to think about is the past. Tryin to figure out the whys...trying to figure out how to let it go...but i believe this will be an impossible task.

I've been thinking about my childhood....where all my problems seemed to begin. Wondering why my dad was so violent...wondering why he is so different now.....wondering why he couldn't change back then but has now. Why?
I wonder why it was made so obvious that my brother was the ""favorite""...why in a sense i was emotionally punished by my family for that and still continue to receive the ""punishment"" today. Am i really that....that worthless?
I wonder why i turned to ""God"" when i was younger for ""love""...latching on to something i no longer believe in for all those years...trying everything i possibly could just to be noticed...to feel...wanted...excepted? All i ever wanted is for just once...for my family to say they are proud of me...that they love me. Instead i was pushed away...never shown any compassion..any love. Now today i find myself latching onto any love i'm given...trying so hard to give love myself in order to receive it....kind of like im reaching out to get what i was never given. But it can't change my past...I can never get back those years...can't change them...can't seem to change the relationships i now have with my family. It comes to something when i can't even give my mum a hug...or tell her i love her despite the fact that shes emotionally scared me with the things she's said, or hold a simple conversation with my dad...just sit there with the awkward silences.....knowing that this is the way its always going to be.
Why is what i do never enough? Why do they constantly find anything to say in order to put me down in someway? I feel so....empty?
Why is it that i'd always be the one people put down at school? I never did any wrong to them...i didn't do a thing. When your put down so so much by everyone around you, the bad stuff is easier to believe. When your put down enough you DO believe it..and it doesn't matter what anyone says you always will. Why is that? *sighs*

I never usually speak about any of this stuff...unless its in my own diary...this is the only diary i have now so thats why i won't use detail....i don't need to write detail when everything is fresh in my memory like it was yesterday....like a splinter in my mind that i can't reach.......like a cut on the roof of your mouth that would heal if you could only stop tonguing it. I feel....ashamed of....my life...my existence. I feel so...useless/worthless/invisible. But i smile...i laugh...i joke...i be the person people expect me to be....have hidden behind a ""false guard"" for so many years now that it just comes naturally to act the way i do.....so much that i don't know who i am anymore. Is this the real me? Or is my life just one big act? dreams, reality....i can't distinguish between the two anymore. And all i feel i can do is sit being pathetic crying about it...tearing myself to pieces because i dunno what else to do. 

""Why"".....the question we will never truly be able to answer it seems. Everyone has a ""why""....everyone has an ""empty"" hole in there life that they can't answer...and because they can't answer it they ask ""why"" all over again. Life it seems, is just a never ending ""why"" until we die...Then the people we leave behind ask ""why""...why now? Does any of this make sense to anyone?

My mind right now...i know i'm ""not well""...i know my depression is slowly getting worse. i'm always depressed up to a certain degree..i can't help it. But i've been down this path before...i know where it leads...I can't handle this...i don't want to...and in the same breath...i have to.

Hayley is on holiday at the minute. I can't stop looking at her pictures...can't stop thinking about her. Everytime i think about her, it gives me somewhat ""strength""....i feel this...this serge of...emotion....of love...so overwhelming that i could cry. She makes me wanna do right in life...makes me wanna be a better person. I'd be so lost without her right now. I can't even begin to imagine my life without her being a part of it anymore.
I'm so afraid of ""pushing her away"" unintentionally. A lot of people fall in to the trap of treating people the way they were when they were younger without even realising it...which is why i try to encourage Hayley to talk about anything with me, in the hope that if i ever did get that way she'd tell me. I'd never want her to feel unwanted...or like we've drifted apart....never.

I love her so much. I just hope in the time ahead i can find the strength to carry on... for both of us....."

And i've just been sat here thinking about it n yeah....

Sight - things become better looking, more beautiful

Hearing - Music and shit sounds better

Touch - Things feel softer and nicer (ever get this?)

Smell - My skunk always smells better when high.. ahhh

Taste - Food tastes much better when you got the munchies...

Phsychic - ""supernatural"" experiences when high. Includedin ESP, OBE, Auras, etc.
crazy shit
  
And there we have it! So i went searchin' and came across this thing called ""on being stoned""...interestingness! Shows what research has come up on the subject of shit that happens to yah when your stoned-lol. so I'ma keep coming back to it lmao. If anyone else fancys a look heres the addy:

"event","For a few weeks now ive had this feelin....not good....

All my friends know that i have this sort of ""sixth sense"" thing...for example...in the past i've had a bad feeling that something has been wrong with one of my friends and i've called them to see if they are ok, and they are in tears or about to do sumat stupid...and i always manage to call at just the right time. Or for another example...with my friend Nikki...she walked out of her house once after an arguement and left me there...i don't know the area in which she lives well so the girl i know from next door walked around with me while i looked for her...n i was like ""she's over there...in the park""...and the girl was like ""nah she never goes the park...lets look over here""....n i was like ""trust me, she's in the park"" and in the distance i was like ""shes there on the bench""...and shes all like ""nah that ain't Nikki"" ...but it was...and somehow i just knew she was there and where she'd be.

...Anyway...back to this feeling i have. I'm not gonna go into detail on who its about...those who know me well will know who i'm talking about anyway...But its about someone from my past, that i have no way of escaping this year..and i have this bad feeling that something is gonna happen...and its getting stronger everyday, so i know its gonna happen soon. All this ""feeling"" is bringing back memories...flash backs...my nightmares are becoming worse and even more frequent...i'm constantly on edge...constantly crying, worrying. A year or so ago i would have done something stupid by now with all the thoughts going on in my head...but i can't do that now...i don't want to, because i have someone too important to lose...someone i couldn't leave behind despite the emotional pain i'm going through at the minute.

Its driving me crazy...putting on this ""emotional front"" all the time, so people think everythings ok....but ive had to do it for years, it comes natural now to be ""happy""....but when i'm alone, everythings so much different. I just feel so helpless right now...there's nothing i can do...and i know the feeling won't go away until whatever i'm waiting for happens...and if its what i think it is, this is only the beginning....and everything will become a lot worse.

I'm trying not to let it get me down at the minute...because it hasn't happened yet...but it will, and thats for certain...and its gonna happen VERY soon...

I dunno what to do :'("

"event","At work there's this girl called Emma.....She has to fetch new applications for the mortgages everyday to me so i can sign them and get them prepared to be batched to the underwriters. And since the first day we met...she has reminded me of....someone i used to know....someone i was very much in love with, but distance between us, tore us apart, and she couldn't handle it anymore...so i had to let her go. And as the months have gone past i keep seeing more and more of this person in her.

Her smile, her looks, her attitude, her sense of hummor...everything. It makes me smile to remember the old times with ""the girl i used to know""..reminded of her through Emma. It's not that i'm still in love with this girl...it's not that at all, obviously i care about her but i love my angel. I think it just gets to me that....with someone i was so close to...intimately and emotionally attatched to...and someone that was always one of my bestfriends...to slip out of my life so easily and vanish...It feels weird. I never get to talk to her anymore, to see how she is..and i just miss having a laugh and a joke with her. But even if i could talk to her now...obviously the whole atmosphere between us has changed because we used to be so close....we don't ""interact"" with each other the same as what we used to...so it makes it a lot harder to strike conversation.

Anyone guessed who i'm talking about yet? I think one or two may have figured it out...

yes....its Britty.

Britty chicka....you gotta keep in touch more girlie, i miss yah *hugz*"

Lost (And Found)- by meeeeeeeee

I can't sleep
Finding it harder everyday
To find my way
Nothing is ever easy
Then you walked into my life
Twisting everything around
I'm so lost I can't be found
I speak in silence
You will never understand

Lost in this world
I can't find myself
There's nowhere left to turn
Lost in myself
Where I cannot find
My dreams from reality
It's all too much, I can't see
I can't stand, I can't breathe
Think it over, think it over
I can't fight it alone
Im lost....
Lost in this world

How much space
Can you take, before it becomes too much?
How many people
can you push away?
Now i'm falling too deep
I'm too scared, I can't speak
For I can't lose you too
Your my air
Your my air...

Lost in this world
I can't find myself
There's nowhere left to turn
Lost in myself
Where I cannot find
My dreams from reality
It's all too much, I can't see
I can't stand, I can't breathe
Think it over, think it over
I can't fight it alone
Im lost....
Lost in this...

Now I believe
I'm strong enough
With you by myside
Now I don't have to
Fight this alone...

Unbreak my chains
Kiss away my fears
Erase this pain
Now it's all about you
Was always about you

Lost in this world
I can't find myself
There's nowhere left to turn
Lost in myself
Where I cannot find
My dreams from reality
It's all too much, I can't see
I can't stand, I can't breathe
Think it over, think it over
I can't fight it alone
Im lost....I'm lost
Found in this world
I am stronger than
The forces of nature
Found in your heart
I can promise you
We'll never be apart
I'm in love, I can see
Found the strength to believe
It's alright, it's alright
I'm lost in your eyes
I'm lost"

id give anything right now to have u here though...its so quiet and peaceful..the sky is so clear and theres loads of stars out...which is unusual for its always cloudy and raining. id love to be able to just luxurate in ur company, and have u close to me in my arms holding u all night...i could stay like that forever. God im so lucky to have you...i dunno what i ever did to deserve u though sweetie. I love you so much... i wish there was a way u could see inside me...or for one second inherit what i feel, but its impossible. ive never felt so vunerable to such a feeling in my whole life, and everytime i think of u...it doesnt matter to me anymore if my world is falling apart, you take over me...and im safe. Id tell you to take my heart and keep it...but what's the point? you already have it...have done for a long time babe. i know in my heart that if i had the power, id do anything for you...id jump in front of a bus with a smile on my face if i thought it would make you happy...because ur everything to me.i dont even care if u think im being cheesy...think what u like, cuz all i know is no matter what i say to try and tell u how much i love you, it will only ever be a fraction of what i actually feel...because the words get in the way.

I Love You xxx"

"event","Worthless, in a word
What is this wreak i've become?
Never seen and never heard
...Take my life

Dark night, surround me
Take away the pain
How can you tell me
Things will ever be the same
When i think back
There's never anyone to blame
...Apart from myself

On a high, play the game
No one knows your not the same
Hide away, for your not strong
They don't know they got you wrong
I am weak, i am nothing
I am the forgotten
...Invisible

Hurt me, put me down
Is that supposed to make me frown?
For i have a mirror!
Take a look, watch it break
...why must i awake?

Forgotten by the world
Forgotten to myself
Afraid to close my eyes
Lost in the unknown
..My mind


Pushed too many times
But this will be the last
Lay fading, invading memories
I can't forget the past
...Broken

Rejection building steadily
Shame is closing in
Laying, no strength to carry on
...I'm not worth it anymore

You tell me things get better
You say that it won't last
...Can't you see?

No one fucking hears me!
Why should i make a stand?
I speak in silence
you'll never understand
You snigger, you point
You hurt, you rape
You hit, you degrade
...You kill

With all this hurt inside
Bursting with anger
And never any pride...
With emotions running wild
Causing confusion
Roaming like a lost child...
With terrible things
Always there, never fading
Depression is what it brings...
Thinking of only one way out
My heart will cry and endlessly shout

Let the pain end...

Die"

"event","WHAT a weekend hehehe. On the Friday night I couldn't sleep...i was so hyped up about seeing ma babe...but in the end i did eventually fall asleep and ended up waking up about 9ish if i remember rightly...i was like AHHHHHHHHHHHH because i'd left my packing and everything. The reason i didn't do it the night before is because usually i end up waking really early when i'm excited about going somewhere, so it woulda helped get rid of some of the time. Anyway, i went to text her to say goodmorning and all and she text me at the same time hehehe. But yeah, i had a quick shower and packed quick and then jumped in the car.

I think i got there around 11ish, and her dad was in the back garden...then i turn to go to the front door and BANG walked straight into her n had a really quick hug. i didn't wanna let go of her (grr) but the fact that she was right in front of me after all the time we'd waited was the best feeling ever. So we went inside and her mum offered me a coffee n started talkin to me about work and what not. So we're chattin for a bit...i'd had one smoke all day n i was dyin for a fag...so i asked could we go to the shop but instead her mum offered to give us a lift....so i said, i'll take ma stuff upstairs then *winx* :P that was the first time we got to be alone if i remember rightly. It felt so good to have her in my arms again..i was as weak as anythin hehehe. So after some kissin n cuddlin we went to the shops. I went to get some smokes and the bitch wouldn't serve me!!!! i was like ""wtf?!?!? do i look like im under 16...im fuckin 18 grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"" lmao, so her mum got them for me..but yeah i cuda strangled that woman, cheeky fuck lol. Anyway, her mum started talking about a place called Conkers in the car....so we went there for a while. It was so funny because Conkers is a bit like a nature place but you can do all sorts there...and theres 2 sides to it...so we took a lil train thing...anyway, there was this lad sat behind us. He obviously had a disorder of some type bless him as he'd sit talkin to himself.....and the train was playing ""summer loving"" from the film grease....and i sang along to the ""awella wella wella UH!"" and did the actions (everyone knows what i mean i hope)....but the lad did it at the same time and we both shouted it too....it was sooooo funny!!! And it was great just spending time with my angel.

When we got back to the house we stayed in the back garden for a bit while her dad was making a shed summer house thingie. Her little brother Adam had gone to a party and was sleeping there overnight...but her little sister Abby just followed us everywhere. So we said we was off to watch a DVD and that she couldn't watch it because it was scary (which it would have been for her because it was 'The Ring')..and she started with her usual threats ""i'll tell dad Hayley did this n that n blah blah blah""....i knew she'd try stuff to get Hayley into trouble like she normally does...so i made a deal with her. I said she could watch my Christmas play with us from when i was 5/6 years old as long as she didn't moan when she couldn't watch the DVDs. But she went back on the deal like most kids do and started being a pain. Abby asked her dad could she watch it and he said no...so silently me n Hayley was thinkin ""yay!"" lmao...or at least i know i was lmmfgdao. So we watched the film...or at least partly watched it (lol) and then we chilled out for a lil...just holding each other n being content in each others company. 

For a while now me and Hayley would joke about online when one of us was gonna get changed in to our pjs and say ""dya need a hand?"" lol....so as it was getting late i threw my pjs and said ""do yah job woman"" lol. After a while she threw hers at me too...i was just thinking ""o0o0o0o0o :P"" (lmao). So we helped each other out of our clothes and just stood there holding each other half naked for a while, then helped put each others pjs on. I was such a good girl...i didn't try anythin like most would have....but it was VERY fuckin temptin LMAO! Shes so perfect in everyway.
Then she gave me late birthday prezzies because she cudnt see me at the time. They are great :P so i gave her a kiss and said thank you.
When we got into bed i gave her a love bite on her stomach so her parents wouldn't see it,then we snuggled up, and it felt so right falling asleep in each others arms *melts*.......

*beep beep beep....rubs eyes* ...damn alarm waking us up lmao! But we had to make sure we was up early to make sure no one knew we'd slept in the same bed rather than me sleeping on the lower bunk and not in the top one with her. And we was just layin there chattin n kissin etc...the things lovers do hehehe. NOW gets very interesting *winx*.... as you all should know by now, i have a habit of tickling Hayley and i was tickling her thigh and the back of my hand went a lil higher than it should of done *whistles innocently* (hehe) anyways, she took my hand and kept it there *DIES* ...anyway, i asked her more than once if she was sure ...i didn't want her doing nothing she didn't really wanna...but she was sure....i made her wait though mwahahaha....quite a turn on knowing how impatient she can get lmao. Anyway, i ain't gonna go in to detail or nothing because by this point i think its pretty obvious what we got up to..n i got 4 words on the subject....""OH MY FUCKING GOD!!"" :P

We went to Donno market that morning...me and hayley wondered round on our own while her mum walked round with abby. I ended up blowing all my money pretty quick lol. Then i started gettin a lil stressed because i was dyin for a smoke but they'd fell out of my pocket in the car so i had to wait lol. 
When we got something to eat her mum called her and she dropped her chips and had to buy more LMAO..bless hehehe. I stuffed my face with a burger :P (god im making myself hungry talkin about this lmao)
Anyway, we got back to the car and i had a smoke...then when we got back to the house we watched Fight club...and everything after that seemed to fly by.....in fact everything went so quick...but i loved every second.
While i was there i made sure i talked about her previous entries on her journal...about Tracey and stuff....to reasure her i love her and that there was no way on earth i would leave her. At one point i got a lil too emotional and cried a lil...i hate crying in front of people, not many people see it often..but i couldn't help it. We was just talking and i was on about how i didn't wanna lose her and i couldn't help it....just the thought of it was enough...I'm hooked on her,just like i know anyone else would be if they got to know her like i do.

Anyway, the time came ...i had a text message from sharon saying ""we're outside"" and then her mum called us as well. So after a long hug and kiss i got ma stuff and headed on out to the car. Few more hugs before i left and then that was that.

It felt so weird when i got home to see her on webcam when she was in my arms less that an hour before-hand....i don't think it had quite sunk in that she wasn't with me. But i spent the rest of the day thinking about her and the rest of that night thinking about while i'd been at hers. Truely a great weekend ...and many more to come hopefully.

I love you Darlin' :*

"event","welps...ive had an uncontrollable urge to dance all day while ive been at work. Chris (a person on my underwriting team) has been eyin' me up again lol. We was both at the printer at the same time and he goes to James ""did u just feel my ass?"" n james is like ""hell no"" ...then Chris goes to me ""Ez...you just touched me up didnt you"" with a grin on his face...so i slapped his ass and said ""in your dreams darlin n winked"" ..YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HIS FACE!! *falls on the floor in laughin*...usually when he's said anything to me like that i've just smiled...i dunno whats gotten into me today. N ive been at the photocopier dancin around n stuff n Atiff and Shah have jus been laughin....must be cuz im looking forward to the pub crawl on friday or sumat.

Welps...not all has been good today. Laura (My bros gf) kinda pissed me off. She knows i haven't seen Hayley since January n i text n asked if it wud be ok if Hayley cud come to her party with me. Anyways...shes all like ""i thought u might ask...i did want it to be like a close family thing...but everyones askin so yeah if you want""....talk about piling on the guilt! so i pretty much told her to stuff it...n then shes all like ""no u can bring her if u like...its just ive had so many family problems lately you know"" ....still pilin on the guilt....so i just said nah it doesnt matter n stuff....n shes like u can bring her, please...i just thought everyone wud forget its ma birthday""......*growls""...bullshit. I remember when i was visiting me dad for the first ever time alone without Andrew being there...i wanted to spend time with him just us....so what did Andrew and Laura do...they fucking ran off together n the police n everythin was involved...n then they ended up stayin at ma dads the week it was meant to be just me. I cried my eyes out but i never said anything to them...i was the one who talked sense into them to come back. grrr n Andrew knew how much it meant to me as well...fucking assholes...thats the most selfish thing they've ever done. So.....if i take Hayley she'll be pissed off....n if i don't take Hayley she'll be pissed off....*smerks*...looks like a win-win situation for me then :P it just pissed me off a bit thats all. But i'll leave it up to Hayley n see what she wants to do. If she doesn't want to go, theres a bank holiday coming up...so we'll have a long weekend together hopefully instead.

OMFG! i found out something interesting the other day...but i can't say because Hayley would probably kill me...in fact..i know she'd kill me LMAO...i know...i'll give a clue...and the clue is ...""TELEPHONE.....SUNDAY....FINGERSMITH"" 

hahahaha  *whistles innocently*

welps i'm off for now...i'll update later if anything comes up"

N'IMPORTE QUOI

ahem...**************

Sometimes it's hard to just sit and think and imagine what life might have been like might I have been a bit more mature or involved in my own life.

Sometimes our own lives can get too far away from from us. Sometimes we lack the words with which to articulate our feelings and cares and reserves and despairs.

Brian Matthew Smith:
He was perfect for me, to say the least.
At any given moment I might have given up on everything and lost myself in his giant arms of love and devotion.

Devotion. Such a beautiful word when used in the context of two people who really, truly care about each other. In all honesty, I cannot say I was devoted, but I cannot say I was not.

I can say, however, that I was young, naive. I was enchanted by the tall athletic drama geek who stole my heart and held ransom my mind. I loved him. I love him. Though I find myself wondering if I gave it all up too soon.

When I ended our relationship, I did not feel bad about it. I did not hold the slightest tinge of guilt in my heart, nor did I care to censor my every inner thought and feeling. There is much to be said about the difference between penting up everything and holding your tongue. I should have held my tongue... I should have cut off my hand.

I wrote this letter, see. This six page letter explicating every unearthly reason why he and I were simply not meant to be, when in all reality it would have been best to just talk to him about the few, important things on my mind. But no. I lacked reserve then. Perhaps I still do.

He wasn't, in fact, supposed to receive that letter. His eyes should never have read those words, and those words could not be taken back. Not those words. Not at all.

We tried to tie up the loose ends. But in my stubbornness I refused the notion of reason and threw away the key that guarded my heart and mind and soul, and I could not bear to look into his eyes as he begged me for an explanation. As he pierced my aura with pain and curiosity.

I was young.

The months passed, and I still could not bring myself to be in any vicinity of his existance. His existance was null to me, yet posing the greatest threat of all-- confrontation. That which I wanted least haunted me once every single week when we would both attend the same church... one building, one santuary, one pew, one alter, one God, whom before I could not raise my hands and pray for forgiveness and kindness.

Eventually I was sure he'd forgotten about me, about us. I was sure he's placed the memory of Matt and Laura in a waste-paper recepticle in the dungeons of his mind. I was certain that he was uninhibited by this affair he'd had with a child... a baby. I was convinced that I was no more a part of his life now than I had been before he first mulled over the thought of me being his bride. His innocence. His love. His pride. 

I was innocent then. I did not kiss him. I would not let the desires and pleasures of the flesh stand in the way of this awesome relationship we had that was built on trust, love, and God. Where is my God now? I am ashamed to revert my eyes back to Him and to tell Him that I have debaucherized myself in His presence. But there is no need to tell Him. He's been there all along.

He visited me. Matt came to visit me before I left for college. He wanted to make sure I was not mad at him, and to assure me that he was not mad at me. It is funny that that week I had also been thinking about him. He gave me a hug and my stone heart melted. But it was too late. He had moved on. And I was about to move away.

I thought about him on and off, and it is becoming more frequent now that I have endured a year of school, only to be disillusioned with relationships and men and love. All the men who have come in and our and in and out and IN AND OUT of my erm.... <i>life</i>... have been incredibly worthless and have only deepened my thoughts that there was only one person for me, and I threw him away. I will never, EVER, find a love like that again.

Call it a self-fulfilling prophecy... call it whatever you want. But in my mind, I am certain that I am destined to die alone. Alone does not mean unhappy, but it does mean that there is no one... NO ONE... capable of handling my moments of psychoticness. No one that will appreciate my unique beauty. I am not a model. I am not a stick. I am a two-digit wearing sonofabitch who avoids scales and mirrors for fear that they will reveal who she really is.

He was my first love. My last love. 

Someone prove me wrong? Someone reassure me that I am still young and that I am not destined to be like this my entire life.

Alone. Sad. Typing alone in a dark room, with nothing bright enough to highlight the tears running down my cheeks in the oh-so-emo fashion that we all know and love.

I'm done now."

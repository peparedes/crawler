"event","""Juice Box Paper Hat and a line of Pixie Stix"" - PlayRadioPlay

So many surfaces so colorless and bland
I've got so many colors in my new box in my hand
One day I'll think about getting
But today I'm just gonna color the sky

Start with the blue draw circular clouds
Then with the green I add the food for the cows
Next with the red I draw a house too small
For any real real person but that don't matter at all

Brown bird with a triangular beak
Yellow legs with three lines for feet
A green car with circular headlights
Bust out the scissors, gonna bring this drawing to life

Mommy please don't make me go to school
I wanna draw a castle and a dragon in a swimming pool
Yellow starts in the black
Blue moon with a happy face these days it's not right

Juice box paper hat and a line of pixie stix

I wanna be the one there
To draw you pictures and play with your hair
Virginia beach isn't too far away from you
Maybe this summer it won't be for me too



^^^^-translated to German, then French then back to English equals....

Friday:  Awesome day!  Brian came to Clover!  And even though we pretty much just drove around for 4 hours, it was great.  I haven't laughed that much in a while.  My cheeks were in some serious pain for the rest of the day!    Now I just have to convince my mom to let me swing down to Summerville for a day.  

Saturday:  FirstBEAT!!!!!!  Rode down to Irmo with Caroline and Patrick (love those kids!).  It was so much fun!  I love hanging out with them - unless it comes to making a decision - haha!  But anyway, Cadets got first.  They had the weirdest show - Volume 2:  Through the Looking Glass(???) - and I didn't much care for it, BUT it was executed wonderfully.  I was rootin for Phantom (2nd or 3rd) or Crown (4th).  I still got a Cadet shirt before the show - still neat.  

Sunday:  Nursery at church.  sleep/eat

While I was at Salkehatchie, I lost 7 pounds.  Yep.  whatever.  I'm not really big on losing weight because I don't need to lose any, just tone up a bit.  However, in the 4 days since my return, I have gained at least 4 of them back.  I have become a total fatty.  eww.  gross.  I know.  I'm working on it.  

Salkehatchie was every positive word that I could ever think of.  And I can't wait until next year! (And 5A state!)

This summer I'm going to hang out with my friends - a lot.

This summer is going to be my last summer before I graduate.

This summer is going to be hot.

This summer will be great.



I got an 82 on my eng. exam.  damn.  and I really studied for it too.  I'm just really worried about my alg. II exam ::shudder::

Graduation was tonight.  I didn't go to the actual graduation, but Wesley and I went after-wards and saw a few people.

THEN!! we went to Patrick's house and chilled til midnight - it was fun.  We played MadGab with Pat's cousin and his girlfriend, who were really cool.  Then we just hung out.  Even though we didn't really do anything then, it was still fun.

That's what I want to do this summer - just chill and enjoy everything and everybody.  I'm not going to try to make everything perfect and amazing - just take what I get and love it.

Speaking of Wesley - Kirsten broke up with him  (!) - I didn't really get any details about it, but what I do know is really sad.  I'm not 'taking sides' in this situation because I can see from both sides and understand what's going on.  But it just breaks my heart for Wesley because I could tell that he really really liked Kirsten.  But, luckily, he's doing pretty good.  

I've got to start working out!  There's this gym in lake wylie that I'm going to try to join or something - I need to get in shape!

I've officially started my spring cleaning! - I took 4 hours yesterday to clear off my floor, organize my shoes, clear off my desk, change the sheets on my bed, put on new ones, and find sneakers.  It was in some desperate need of cleaning!  And I'm still no where near finished - I've totally got to re-arrange it again.  I hate it the way it is.  

Kirsten's party was last weekend!!!!!  It was awesome!!!!!  So much fun!!!  'I stink, therefore I am.""  hahahahahaha - good times.
We've definitely got to get the girls together more often this summer.

well, I'm exhausted.  I'll be back within a few days (hopefully).  peace."

May 10th - still trying to finish 1984, but having an extremely hard time with it.

May 11th - We'll, I'm officially sick.  I was supposed to babysit Mrs. Strauss' 4 kids tonight, but I'm just coughing and sneezing all over the place & I don't think it's best that I watch her kids in this condition.  But I did get Kirsten C. to do it for me.  I love that girl!  She's just so damn dependable!  But yeah, Mrs. Strauss wasn't very happy when I told her that I wouldn't be able to watch her kids that night.  *shrugs*  Oh well, at least I found a suitable replacement.

May 12th - Still reading  1984.  It's a good book, I'm just having a hard time sticking with it.  Probably because the first week I had it I was reading The DiVinci Code instead (<<<< Most Awesome Book EVER!).  Oh well.    Still sick.  Went to the doctor today and found out that I HAVE ALLERGIES!!!!!!  gah!  But the doctor was cool about it and gave me a popsicle.  AND the nurse guy that does all the basics was SO FREAKING HOTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!  OMG he was so gorgeous!!!!!  

May 13th - Went shopping with Syd for Mother's Day gifts.  It was fun.  We went to Chilie's afterwards, since we'd both been cravingn it for about a month.  I got my mom this really nice candle and chapstick from Bath & Body Works, and I painted the candle for her.  
Caroline's Dance Recital!!! - It was so good!  Everyone was great.  I kind of almost wished I never had to quit.  
Beginning of season finale of Grey's Anatomy is tonight! 

May 14th - Mother's Day!!! - Mom loved her candle!  -  But my stupid sister had to ruin it by making mom take her shopping.  gah!

May 15th - Band Concert!  It was great.  
I called Brandon afterschool to see if he could come to the concert, but unfortunately he's going to be in Columbia all summer.  dang.  oh well.  I've got Salkahatchie boys to keep me company.  (jk)
The season finale of Grey's Anatomy was on tonight.  It was amazing/awesome/terrible/heart-breaking/inspirational all at once.  I've never cried over a t.v. show until tonight.  And I wasn't just crying-I was sobbing.  It just relaly opened my eyes to everything.  It was beautifully done.  

May 16th - Still trying to read 1984 - we have a project on it due thursday, and the quiz on part III, and I just finished part II.  maaaaaaan.
I got a babysitting job this saturday for my cousin's 2 little boys.  They're really good, so it's gonna be great.  

May 17th - still on 1984.
I got my Exam review for Alg. II - scary.
Too late to sign up for the next SAT - but I got a thing for the ACT which I'm probably not going to be able to do either - oh well - I'm just gonna have to get on it next time.

May 18th - Turned in my 1984 project - it was okay
Went shopping with Mom and got some great stuff - woot!
On our way home from shopping there was this minor storm, but it managed to knock down a tree RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR DRIVE WAY!  But there were a few people there who managed to save the day - thank god!

May 19th - Half Day!
Rey Azteca for lunch
Got Yearbooks - which suck ass! - the band doesn't even have a page, while the choaliers got 2 pages! - And there are so many typos!  minor things too!  It's so bad - BUT My Mom did get the Yearbook dedicated to her which was really great - I almost started crying - it was so sweet!
Band Banquet was preety sweet - I got Section leader-woot! - and I looked extremely hott.
Went to McD's with Caroline & Mrs. Susan afterwards to discuss everything.  It was cool.

And That's about it!

Enjoy!"

Got Colin's boutonniere (sp?) at 10.
Home by 10:20.
chill.

Then I got bored at noon.  So I I.M.ed leah and asked if I could come over until syd and I went to get our hair done.  She said it was fine.  Went to Syds.  Piddled around there for a while.  So then were about to leave in a few and I decide that I want to go jump on the trampoline for just like, 2 minutes.  And Leah went with me.  So we're on the trampoline just having a grand old time.  and then leah gave me a super jump (which I love) and I ended up not really aiming the right way on the trampoline-so I go flying towards the edge, my hip lands on the bar, and grab the tree somehow and topple to the ground.  IT WAS GREAT!  Even though I ended up with a bruised hip ON THE DAY OF PROM!!! But it was cool after my mom got me icy-hot patch-things.

Then I went to get hair done, and Lynn was amazing!  My hair was literally perfect!  It really couldn't have been any better.

Colin looked great!!!!!  His hair was excellent!!!!!!  He, also, couldn't have been better!  Gah, everything about yesterday was perfect!!!!!  

Prom was awesome!  I really had such a blast!  Like, I didn't think it would be that great, but it was!  And I got to dance with everybody, which was also freaking sweet!  Gah, we danced like the WHOLE time.  So much fun!!!!!!  

After party-Also awesome!!!!!  Everything was phenomenal (except for that one hour and a half that we're going to ignore)!!!!!  especially the food!  gah! great!

---I don't recommend the movie Hostel.  It sucks.  No plot whatsoever.---

Breakfast also great.


Everything about the past 2 days has been superb!  

Now I can't wait til next year!


And all of the girls decided that we're going to wear our prom dresses to the band banquet on the 19th.  That should be a good night too!

Ahhhhhhh!!

Even though I'm about to fall asleep right now, I'm on such a happy high!  I'm just still excited about everything!   : DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

DM = scary......no, more like terrifying, but there is a HUGE chance that I won't get it.  Not because I can't do it, but because of political reasons, which are freaking gay!  and totally unfair!!!!!!!!!
But it's okay.  I've learned to deal with this kind of stuff.  But it still hurts....only at first.

Now, on the Spring Trip....Lots going on with Helen, Cody, Logan and Lauren.  L and L broke up, and were fine.  H and C did the same, and it was mutual at first, but the next day, C decides to ""stir things up"" and make a big deal about it.  There are so many fine details that it would take a year and 6 days to explain it all in an understandable manner.
Syd and Trey were all over eachother the whole time.  Whatever, they're happy, and it's all good.
Conner still hates me.  I have no clue what to do about it.  I tried to talk things out, but he wouldn't give me a chance.  And the only thing I want is for us to at least be friends again.  I miss my Conner-hugs.  *shrug* oh well, this is the punishment I receive for my mistake.
Matt and I are super cool now.  Like we friend bonded over the trip, and we're buddies now.  it's all good (?)
I had cramps during the entire trip.  enough said.
It was a sucky schedule, but whatever.  I tried to make the best of it.
The beach was great for the 20 minutes that I got to spend on it.  yeah, got to wrestle with Jew in the sand, and managed to get his shoes off, and get a LOT of sand in my pants (<the not fun part), but it was pretty good.
I'm just super glad to be home.

I think Ben Robertson ""asked"" me to the prom today.  Like I was going up to buy the tickets for me and conner, and then Ben came up to me and said, ""Colleen, do you have a date for this thing?""  ""Yup!""  and then 2 seconds later after he'd walked off I realized what he was trying to say, and then I felt so bad!!! like, heartbreak slap in the face!!  I felt really bad.  *shrugs* but he's a tough guy, he'll survive.

I CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just when I'm beginning to think that things are getting better for me, something shitty has to happen and bring me right back to this hell, which everyone knows as life.   I hate this.  

NO ONE EVEN SEES!!!! everyone is blind! This isn't just normal, yeah that kindof sucks.  No, this is, omg that really fucking sucks for you.  but no one sees!  they don't notice.  and if they do, then they just ignore it.  

I can't do a damn thing right.  there hasn't been one day this year where I haven't made another damn mistake.  

Crying only makes things even fuzzier.  so fuck that too.

The only way that I can really say what's going on is through writing.  But even then, I know better than to tell my parents about that kind of stuff.  To them, it's not acceptable.  It's not good enough.                 They don't even think that I can get into college.  She is threatening to take away the one thing that will give me freedom.  FUCK HER!!!!!!!

Monday night I went to the CYWE concert, and then I came home and finished my research paper.  I didn't have a lot to do, so it wasn't too bad.  Ben accidentally erased his on monday night, and had to type the entire thing again.  I felt really bad for him b/c he'd worked so hard on it.

Band:  Concert festival preview was last night.  It was pretty good.  not our best, but not nearly our worst.  We still have a lot of work to do before next week which really sucks.  

distance = hell

Ok, so here's the story of the prank war.  I was over at Leah's this weekend b/c Syd was at All-State, and we were just hanging out when I came across her pokemon cards.  She has like 500 of them (!!!).  Then I got this brilliant idea: Cover Syd's perfect room in pokemon cards.  It was awesome!  We had them everywhere!  and there are a bunch hidden around too, so she'll be finding them until she moves out.  It was great.
We'll Syd decided to get revenge.  and she enlisted the help of Caroline.  So, one day this week, Syd convinced one of Leah's friends in the Jr High to put all of the pokemon cards in Leah's locker.  I wasn't there, but I heard they were all over the place when Leah opened her locker.  
I knew that I was next, and I was expecting it.  So, after the concert last night, Caroline and Syd tell me that there's is a ""surprise"" in my car from them.  I knew what was going on, so it wasn't as great as it could've been but it was still good.  They put vaseline under the driver side door handle, and all over my windows.  it was pretty good.  I even got Daniel G. to fall for it like 5 minutes later when he walked up.  I got it off the door handle when I got home, but I left it on the windows.  I really don't care, I'll just go to a car wash this weekend, and hope that does the trick.  
Leah and I are already starting to plot our prank.  can't say here though.  More later.


I really miss what was....

so yeah, that's my life.  woo hoo!

"event","I wouldnt say this involved much skill (though i finally got the ribbon into a nice clean looking attachment to a toggle clasp)

Mostly i just love the stone. Not bad for something that cost like $3 to make!

"event","Today's fair was quite small. I actually liked it alot more. My favorite dealers were there, but it was far less crowded. 

I did however almost commit an act of violence at the CGM booth. I was planning to spend a decent amount of money on findings, so I politely waited my turn while making sure the sales guys saw me there. There is always a wait as their prices are very good and there are always a couple people getting big orders of stuff. However, after about half a hour of waiting i got really pissed, the sales guys kept skipping me. One woman who had cut in front on me was very slow deciding what she wanted and when she was done another woman cut in front of me again, i made an impatient noise and she turned to me and said ""she was here when I got here so it is her turn"" I turned to her and said ""yeah, well i was here when she got here, so both of you cut in front of ME"" I made sure the salesman heard me as well. so about 5 minutes later i finally got help. Being patient and then decisive in ordering I would think would be good traits, but apparently they only like people who yell at them and then sit and stare at spools of chain for 10 minutes instead of deciding while they wait. I hated to even give them business, but there is a good reason they get away with bad service: 50 cent sterling toggles and cheap tiny sterling headpins and the cheapest and best chain I have found anywhere. dammit.

I also finally found the number for the weekly farmer's market down the street. I will call Monday. I think it would make for good practice and I know they get a decent amount of people there because I go all the time. I neve heard anything from the Melrose one. double dammit.

I got many tiny little pearls to play with, better quality than I usually use, but I found them for like $2 a string and i got some gorgeous big cherry quartz coin shaped beads that were in a clearance bin for $5 for like 12 of them.  

I also got a couple of really pretty big stone pendants. just for me. :)

now to sort everything all nicely and make stuff!"

"event","i have been playing with stuff all day today and thought i would share some stuff i learned. 

First: i work way too much with pink. I really must venture out more...but it looks so pretty with the black chain...

second: the silver componants from artbeads.com blacken beautifully in the stinky sulfur stuff i got a few weeks ago. I love it! and i have years worth of the stinky stuff since it takes so little for each batch. Their chain just sat in there and got to a nice deep even color in about 20 minutes. Maybe sooner, i dont know, i just let it soak, and that seemed to work well.  

I sent out an e-mail to the big market on Melrose. I hope I hear soon. I have so many pieces that i think i an sell but that arent really so inspiring that i want to go to all the trouble of putting them on the site. So, once i get a table, i am thinking of putting all my failed parcatice stuff and really simple stuff together in a $5 rack kinda thing. It's a good way to get rid of my really cheap beads that i dont really like working with anyway.  

I also got some great chain and headpins from a place called CGM, the website is www.cgmfindings.com  but i cant tell if you can actually order stuff there...

and MAN! the show is showing the silver clay stuff, it is too fucking cool. I really wanna play with it! but for now i wont, cats + small aprtment + fire = bad idea..."

"event","the hand of god falters tonight -
And the world silently surrenders.

left to ashes in a sunday's moonlight
stumbling, it bleeds
tripping, it dies.

Not with a whimper - 
But a whisper; the breath of a delicate tone

Beauty onto beauty, until death fray the folds
The future's forsaken itself so I'm told."

"event","Here are some of my alter-egos . . . in case you spot them.

1) Desmond St. English . . . London swinger.
2) Frederic Jones . . . guitar legend.
3) Frederic Five-0 . . . struggling underground rapper.
4) Frederic Marc Hanson . . . an oil-painter, like my dad.
5) Rory Madchester . . . just a really stupid name.

Sometimes I write under 'Freddy Hanson,' that's also me.

oh . . . and sometimes I like to use no name at all, just false-intitials . . . 'AP' . . . but those are mostly reserved for the fabulously-factual front-pages of syndicated publications."

"event","It's a real buzz-kill to drive home. And I really have not been doing any writing lately, which is good, because writing is like the banana of life . . . sure, it looks really nasty on the outside, but when you open it up, it's even worse.

I was watching the Ashlee Simpson show today (I do whenever it's on), and I noticed that she, her, Ashlee - the apple of my eye - is like someone else I know, a girl . . . one of those . . . well, you know. Anyways - she's less cooler than Ashlee, plus, she's like the . . . something-that's-worse-than-an-apple of my eye. But yeah . . . she also has this supposed 'musically-gifted' boyfriend . . . which is funny . . . music sucks."

"event","Here's how big of a bastard I am - after losing (I still maintain they were lost by the maid) Lane's birthday supplies in Spain, I managed to spill ice on his computer while drunk, frying it's insides . . . now, I'm a bastard to myself as well - not to mention my finances - because I owe my friend $400.

Here are the other reasons:

1) I'm not . . . 'good with women'
2) I 'smoke too much pot' 
3) I sometimes use stupid psuedonyms . . . or however that's spelled
4) One time, when I was two years old, I accidently 'touched' a lady's chest in the mall with mom . . . and the lady apparently got really mad at me - but I was a pretty cute little boy
5) I actually started a livejournal . . . it's actually a big joke . . . and I actually lie in all my entries, so stop reading.
6) I cook chinese food, but I'm not chinese"

Girls wear faces like a Disney animation
Girls ambush me - what's wrong with feeling attraction?
Everything . . . I guess
It kills the principle - don't underwrite my life
I can do whatever I please, be it a friend or enemy
I'm not here to be your man, that's why you have a memory"

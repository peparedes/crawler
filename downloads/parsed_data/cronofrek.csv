So I've been looking for a condo, as I mentioned in my last post. I was *this* close to putting an offer down when I started to think to myself ""hmm...well you know, prices dropped like crazy year-over-year...do I have any assurance that they won't keep dropping?"" and I searched ""housing prices"" and got <a href=""http://patrick.net/housing/crash.html"">this</a> page. It definitely freaked me out, and I'm spending a lot of effort right trying to figure out whether this guy is crazy or not.

The truth is that while I know about certain risks I'm taking, I haven't really sat and actually analyzed the differences between renting and buying at the moment. And so after seeing this page that was telling me not to buy, and figured I should start really investing time into figuring out whether I am making the decision.

I find this link interesting because it is very similar to a lot of other stuff I've found on the internet. The only term I can think of to explain is ""information from nerds"". This guy is not in real estate and has no training in finances...he's a programmer. Because of this, I fear that the reason I connect with his rhetoric is because he speaks my language, not because he's actually right.

But here's I still pay attention: as far as I can tell his numbers are right. And there is definitely a high risk that prices will continue to go down, seeing as unemployment in Seattle is at an all-time high. Same with foreclosures. You're also seeing a ton of condo-builders dropping prices like crazy and even just taking inventory off the market to rent.

It comes down to a simple equation: does it make more financial sense to rent or buy? I always just assumed that buying made more sense. But looking at the numbers, I'm not sure... especially since I am second guessing whether I want to stay in a condo for more than 3 years. In fact, all really want to do is move nearer to Capitol Hill...I don't really care how I get there.

The other reason I pay attention is because I think there is a part of me that believes that we are still clinging to an old system that shouldn't still work the way it does. The fact that you lose 6% of the value of a house through commission to the real-estate agents seems crazy (and I can guarantee you, after talking with my agent, that they live pretty damn well off of that money!) And the reason it seems crazy is because, well, we have the internet now! Every single house I've looked, or nearly every house is one that *I* found online. My agent has provided me with advice, and that has been valuable, but at the same time, I would rather just hire her as a consultant for a fee than have her take a percentage of the cost of the condo I buy.

This information plays to my fears perfectly, and I want to make sure I keep clear head. But at worst, if I decide to wait a year, I doubt I'm going to look back and think I missed out on a great opportunity. I think if I ultimately choose to continue renting I'm making a smarter and safer decision. It *is* possible that I will be worse off, but considering the market, it's looking unlikely.

"event","<lj-cut text=""My take on Heroes"">
If there's one thing that bugs me more than anything about Heroes, it's the fact that the series' title makes no sense, which is something that was made apparent this last volume.

One thing about the standard hero is that a hero <i>saves people</i>. They do things that are selfless, brave, and, well, <i>heroic</i>. The show has been setting up each of these characters as possessing something special that allows them to be save the world. The narrative of the show from the beginning is they were all destined for greater things.

So here's the problem. After 3 volumes, no one has done anything to save anyone from anything. the show has primarily been a character-driven show with no real central plot to drive things forward. Every character deals with their own demons and that's all there is to it. At the beginning of the first season I was led to believe each character was coming together to save the world, but in the end they don't really do anything except resolve their own personal conflicts.

There are definitely attempts in the Heroes universe to tie things together into some sort of central plot, and you can see hints of it in each season. After all, season one had the giant blast in New York, season 2 had the virus outbreak, and season 3 had Arthur Petrelli wanting to give people powers.

But if you look at each of these plots closely, you'll see that they are empty, and don't provide a context in which to develop these characters as heroes.

For instance, in season 1 they are trying to save New York from a giant nuclear blast. Simple, right? No, because it turns out that the people trying to get this done are all part of the ""company"", and that it's all meant for the good of mankind, and it turns out that Sylar is the one who's going to do it, but we don't know why, but wait, it turns out Peter is actually the exploding man, and we don't know why <i>he</i> has to explode. And it turns out that it was going to New York in the first place that caused the problem for Peter, and that he KNEW he shouldn't go but he went anyway.

So all in all I feel like the plot was basically just a reason for all the super-powered people to bitch at each other. Whatever danger that existed was fabricated by the ""heroes"" (the company people), and resolved by the ""heroes"" (the new super-powered people). In other words...it was very self-involved.

It goes on like this for two more seasons as well. Season two is all about a virus, oh but it turns out the company made it, and they could have destroyed it but they didn't and now some other guy wants to release it for the same reason the company folk wanted to blow up New York last season. More bitching, more fabricated danger.

What these two seasons taught us is that the world would have been better off if super-powered people just hadn't existed in the first place. These people aren't heroes, they're villains.

But if there was one thing that was awesome about these first two seasons, it was Sylar. Purely malevolent, purely power-hungry, no guilt, no remorse...just evil. That is until season 3 came along.

It's in season 3 that we learn that Sylar is actually a monster who was created by the company. It was the company that drove him to kill more people! They were the monsters after all for doing this to him! So it turns out that Sylar is just another product of the old heroes of this world, who seem to think they know how to save the world but end up just fucking it up each time. And because of that we lost the one thing about the show that was <i>actually</i> interesting.

So in my opinion the show shouldn't be called ""Heroes"". It should be called ""People Who Learned They Can Read Minds and Now Think They're Hot Shit"".

This wouldn't bother me as much as it does if the writing was better, because there are plenty of good character-driven shows, and this could be one of them. The problem is the writing in Heroes is awful. Each character was either frustratingly one-dimensional (Claire, Peter), or wasn't able to stay consistent for longer than a single episode (Nathan, Angela, Sylar, Elle, Dr. Suresh). Each characters motivations were based <i>way</i> too heavily on dreams, visions of the future, soothsaying, and that comic book that is still getting published somehow (seriously, there are 4 different ways this show uses ""the future"" to move the plot along! WTF?)

So let's consider these facts that are in the article:

1. There is no strong evidence (or <i>any</i> evidence really) that gay couples are less capable of raising a child than straight couples are.

2. Currently, in Arkansas, there are 3 times as many children needing foster care as parents you are willing to provide their homes.

I can deal with California banning gay marriage on some level. But I can't deal with clear-cut stupidity like this.

Oh, and I'm sure many of the same people who voted for this ban are completely against abortion. That's not to say I think abortion is the solution, I would MUCH rather a mother carried their baby to term. But I think you don't get to have both. You don't get to say a person is forced to have a child, AND that certain people who want to take care of that child, and <i>could</i>, are not allowed.

I think I've been pretty lucky to be able to sit back and not think about it, but for the first time the clash of values has hit me somewhat personally, as I recently got this e-mail from my Uncle (who doesn't know I'm gay)

""I didn't reallize this, but it sounds like Arizona is trying to do a ""Prop 8"" in their state.  Prop 102 - http://yesformarriage.com/

Maybe other states are doing this as well?

This reminds me of the great battle in the Pre-Existence.""

For those of you who don't know, the battle of the Pre-Existence is a story about how Jesus and Satan (who are brothers in the Mormon mythos) both had different plans for humanity. Jesus wanted to let people go to Earth and choose to be good or evil, while Satan wanted to let people go to Earth but force them to be good. Satan's supporters are banished to the outer darkness while Jesus' supporters are sent to Earth (this is a pretty simplified version, but you get the gist).

Basically my uncle is comparing supporters of gay marriage with supporters of Satan. You can't hear something like that and be a little peeved, right? 

And of course I can't really <i>say</i> anything. I admit I'm gay and I'm automatically wrong by virtue of religious doctrine. But more than anything, I guess I just fear throwing away my relationship with my religious side of the family, which I don't want to do despite my disagreements with them.

Nevertheless, I am lucky. There are some people who risk alienating their entire family because of their sexual orientation. I'm at least lucky my Mom and most of my brothers are on my side.  But it's more proof that I can't just sit here and pretend like I can go through life, benefit from the painful work other gay rights activists do and turn up my nose at it all. Gay rights isn't about promoting a lifestyle, and I will still criticize the elements of activism that does that. But I should always be willing to defend the <i>idea</i> of same sex love simply because it is not immoral, and doesn't deserve to be demonized."

Two other shows I've started watching recently are Entourage and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I would describe Entourage (if someone hasn't already) as Sex in the City for guys.

Just look at that statement and ask yourself if it doesn't sound anything but ridiculous.

This is, of course, in reference to the Large Hadron Collider, the biggest, most expensive particle accelerator ever built that will start smashing particles together on October 21st. Some people are afraid that these collisions could result in a black hole that would eat the earth.

I've been reading up on this and apparently the same theories that suggest a black hole could be created are also the same ones that suggest it would disappear instantaneously. <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/bigbang/asktheexpert.shtml"">This article</a> had some interesting facts on the experiment.

I hate to say it but I get anxious about it too, but I look at it and realize that that's just the kind of personality I have. I'm kind of a hypochondriac and I can imagine someone with that kind of personality trait would feel worried about this. It's the (perceived) possibility of a catastrophic event happening that you can't control, and that's scary. I do this with a lot of things. I remember being scared to death of Ebola in high school after watching a documentary about it.

I think what's frustrating about this, for me, is that this will probably keep the current high house prices steady, making it harder for me to buy.

Basically, it seems to me like they're helping to price me out of a house, and are using my money to do it. I mean, it sounds cold as hell, but I'd be happy to see house prices plummet. May suck for irresponsible owners, but is awesome for a first-time buyer!"

Not just because of the terrible acting, or the boring direction, or crappy special effects, but because the main character is a complete and utter douchebag, and somehow I'm supposed to feel like he's the good guy.

Here's the plot of the movie: Guy learns he can teleport, guy goes and steals millions of dollars worth of cash, guy tries to impress girl, guy nearly kills girl, movie ends with guy getting the girl anyway and living happily ever after off of said cash. Oh, and somewhere in there is a boring plot about how some religious nuts want to kill people who can teleport.

Good news is I did the ride, and the ride is apparantly supposed to be harder to than the StP (something about it having more hills) and all told it was really no harder than my usual rides, so I felt like I did well, and I feel a lot more confident in my abilities.

Bad news is that the lack of sleep caught up with me and that (along with my sunburns) is dragging me down like crazy.

Well, I feel good about myself today. I also feel good about myself because I gave up the last spot on a bike rack on my bus to a guy from England who was visiting (meaning I had to wait for the next bus). Right now I just want to feel proud of myself, and I think I deserve to."

"event","Man, I absolutely love the concept behind Dexter. The idea of a sympathetic serial killer alone is enough to pique my interest, but once I got around to actually watching the show (finished the first 8 episodes of season 1), I find that the character of Dexter is even more interesting to watch than I thought he would be.

The main reason for this is that they really flesh out the kind of person who was as he grew up and how his relationship with his father affected who he is today. In particular, their relationship is largely about helping Dexter to learn to control his violent impulses. I mean, from a certain perspective this is the kind of thing that X-Men or Heroes is about...learning to control some sort of dark part of you. If you think about it for a second, that, to me, seems like an incredibly unique way to approach the topic.

And so Dexter's desire to kill is framed as this purely instinctual thing, something he simply can't escape, but yet at the same time Dexter has a very clear sense of right and wrong.

But on top of all this there's the very real theme of being disconnected from your emotions, and Dexter, being a serial killer after all, represents that in such a powerful way.

On top of it all, it doesn't hurt that Dexter is played by the same guy who was David on Six Feet Under.

It makes for good TV. Stuff like this, Sopranos, Six Feet Under, could it have even existed on TV 15, 20 years ago? Either way, I'm glad we have networks that have the balls to put this stuff out."

I'm not going to go deep into it, but let's just say:
- I got invited to Valve's Steam party on the first night of GDC (my co-worker went to school with the project lead for Portal, so I got to meet her as well as other awesome Valve employees). I got to see Jonathan Coulton play a few songs, including ""Still Alive"" on Rock Band. 

Interesting fact: I work two blocks away from the Valve offices, so it sucks this is the first time I've ever talked to anyone there. Team Fortress 2 ftw.

- I went to dinner with a bunch of SP employees and some former employees, including one who currently works at Harmonix. I basically spent a bunch of time asking Rock Band questions. I also had some amazing chocolate Souflee.

- I went to some great talks, including one by Ken Levine about BioShock, which was very interesting. Some were pretty lame, but overall I feel like I learned a lot. Though unfortunately <i>some</i> companies like to use their keynote as a press conference *cough Microsoft cough*. But hey, at least I was there when they announced Gears of War 2, something I bet Maria would be jealous about :P

- I got to hang out with Kurtis that weekend. I've never seen Berkeley before (the city or the University). The cool thing is we got to play Halo 3 and Rock Band in the CS Grad lounge all night.

GDC was a very cool experience. Of course most of all it was pretty cool to be in a place where most everyone was a game developer. Rock on."

"event","So, first of all, this is clearly not a game about the battle system. I've gone into about 5 battles in the last 2 hours. The rest of the time is taken up by, obviously, loads of cut-scenes, movies, etc.

It started off shaky, and there is still a lack of character to a lot of the dialog and your interaction with people. It really was like I was playing Final Fantasy IV all over again. Not that I think FFIV had a bad story per se, I mean it was good for an SNES game...but not for a game that spans 4 DVD's.

But then the first ""dream"" began, and that's when I decided this game was worth playing. Ok, so the dreams are a bit...dramatic, but the writing really is superb, and I absolutely love the concept of interspersing stories like this throughout the game to find.

And I will say that some of the characters are starting to gain some footing, become more interesting to watch.

It's hard not to initially roll your eyes at a game made by Hironobu Sakaguchi about an amnesiac hero with a big sword who works for a massive government that harvests magic energy to go to war with other countries, but I think it'll be worth giving this one a shot."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Baptisms for the Dead"">
Looking back, the strangest thing I ever did while I was a Mormon was the baptisms for the dead. On the surface Mormonism isn't a strange religion, and like any religion there are a lot of arbitrary rules that you have to follow if you are a devout member, but there is something particularly odd about baptisms for the dead.

11 or 12 years ago, when I went with some friends to the temple to participate in this ritual, I didn't think much of it, and I still don't. I dressed up in some white clothes, and was baptized while being told whom I was being baptized for. For me it was a social thing, not a spiritual thing. Hell I've never been enough of a spiritual person to see the significance in something like that.

The baptisms for the dead <i>are</i> indeed significant, in more than a few ways. It's significant to Mormons because they believe it's the only way that a deceased person can every find eternal salvation if they never knew of the church. It's also significant to people of other faiths because they very <i>idea</i> is an absolute affront to their own beliefs.

But I think the most significant thing about this ritual is what it says about the spirit of the Mormon doctrine. If you think about the implications of this ritual, it's essentially saying that by submerging some person in water, back first, and then pulling them out again, you've managed to save some deceased person. I think it's significant when you ask ""why?""

Imagine this...a person who never heard of the Mormon church dies one day...they're in their eighty's, and it was their time. They get to the after-life and are greeted with a very South-Park-esque scene where they find out that the Mormons, a seemingly innocuous religion that spawned in America, was the correct religion, and that they are doomed to spend all of eternity in hell (Or outer darkness, or the 3rd heavenly kingdom, I can never remember where these people are actually supposed to go).

This person sees this scene and is made aware of his terrible luck to not have even have <i>heard</i> of the one true church, which has doomed him to a life of sadness.

<i>But wait</i>, there is a way out! If mortals on earth baptize him into the Mormon church, he will be saved! Oh, if only someone can commit the self-less act of baptizing themselves in his name, he will have eternal happiness!

But until that time, sit down, take a number, and wait your turn.

I find this significant because I believe that baptisms for the dead mean that Mormons think the after-life functions essentially like a DMV.

This leads me to ask...why would a loving God come up with this kind of rule? Certainly an omniscient God <i>knows</i> that said man was never made aware of the church, so why would he or Jesus or whoever else tell him ""sorry, but if you wait your turn, we can let you through the door""

I just don't see the point in a rule like this. All religions builds themselves on these sets of rules that are meant to determine your worthiness for salvation, but when you look closely it becomes obvious how arbitrary and convoluted they are.

Now, assuming the after-life exists, and acceptance into it is based on some sort of moral code, there is the universal question of who is right and who is wrong. Am I allowed to be gay? Am I holier if I kill and die for my beliefs? Does reading scripture every day make me more worthy? Every religion likes to answer these questions in their own ways, and so it can be confusing, at least to someone like me who needs these rules to make <i>some</i> sort of logical sense.

But when I think back about baptisms for the dead, it puts all this worrying into perspective. Baptisms for the dead, in my view, don't make <i>any</i> sense, and yet they are a corner-stone of the Mormon religion. It represents how religion can come up with rules for salvation that are arbitrary, and it shows how religion can affect spirituality in a deeply negative way. 

So why do baptisms for the dead exist in the first place, you might ask. Well, it comes from Joseph Smith's fears that his brother would not be sealed with him for eternity, and that it was only through Joseph's actions that his brother could be saved. In other words, it existed as an explanation for some of the unfortunate contradictions in how the rules of his faith played out, i.e. that you have to be baptized to be saved, and that this was impossible if you never even knew who the Mormons were.

Ultimately, the baptisms for the dead exist as a way of bringing together the logic behind the rules and regulations of the Mormon faith, without invalidating those rules. With baptisms for the dead, the church can still have strict rules regarding salvation but still have a way of it making sense somehow. What this really means is that the Mormon church uses the baptisms for the dead as a way to justify their ownership of spirituality, which I think is a horrible thing. It dissolves the idea of individuality and upholds conformity to an arbitrary dogma.

This realization helps me though. It helps me to realize that the church has tried to own spirituality, and it is through this desire to rule the spirit that you can see where they're message falls flat.

And really, that is one of the many reasons I am no longer a Mormon

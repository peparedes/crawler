I really wish i could pin this all on me.
How come everytime he does something hurtful to me, im always the one to be punished, or apologize first.
This is just like last year. almost to a T.
Im miserable without him, hes doing just fine.

I got nothin.
I cant find a job.
My roomates dont care all that much about me.
Im so distant from rochester and everyone therein, that i cant really go back there.

I dont feel I belong anywhere.
Everything I try to establish for myself, or him, or us, blows up in my face.
Constant, utter failure.

I want nothing more but to weep it all away...

After dreaming of you and me
Im waking up all alone
Waking up so releived....

I really miss last spring.
It was crazy, and dramatic, and sporatic, and at times very painful.
But it was spent with those dear to me.
Ive faded away from everyones heart, from everyones mind.
I want to be the leader of the pack again.
I want to be living my life for me.

I woke up feeling very strange today. definately not myself.
Got up around 12ish. and just layed on my back trying to decipher my dreams,
unscramble my brain.
Of course to no avail, but it was a splendid way to waste 3 hours.

The job hunt somewhat continues.
Im laying low on it for a little while, because i had been completely consumed with trying to get a job,
before i had my first interveiw.

Ill finish putting in the applications ive already filled out, then i think im going to wait a week.
there are other aspects of my life that need nurturing while i wait to be employed.

Things are weird with david.
Nick gave me a tarot reading last night, and it pretty much confirmed everything i already knew subconceiously,
but just chose not to aknowledge. (maybe im crazy, but that doesnt seem like a real word...)
rather depressing actually.
Im making the choice not to let it eat me up though.
What is to be, will be, if you do nothing to help it.
So im just going to take a step back and let life come at me for a while.

Tomorrow i call andy to try and make other arrangements for his cat.
Sunday i have to call mom.
Tonight i need to give my dad a call, because i was under the impression he was going to send me money.
The first week of june ill have a bit of money. not as much as i had hoped, but still. money nonetheless.

and that about summs it up.
dull,dreary, yet refreshingly unpredictable."

MANIC DEPRESSIVE, WHAT??!!??!!

About 6 hours ago, i was happy as a clam, not a thing can gring me down.
I had my roomate cut my hair.
And now i feel/look hideous.
Mind you i dont have any makeup on.
But still.
Ive always been at least halfway satisfied with my appearance.
Now i cant stand to look in the mirror.

I forgot how atrocious i look with bangs i guess.
I miss my david already.
I really have no idea how im going to handle this 2 or 3 or however many months.
Certain people have made me realize that i have so many personal issues, with things like affection, and trust, communication, and the delicate balance between my independance/dependancy, that if i dont drive my own damned self crazy in 3 months, i'll have driven david away from me.

No matter what he says, i still have this horrible stabbing little thought that im going to lose him again.

Why am i so insecure?
Why can i no longer grasp the concept of trust?

IM so damned frustrated right now.
I was SOOOO happy, spending all day with david. Despite his sister, and her kids, and davids sleepyness.
I was practically ecstatic! allllll day. Untill about 10 pm.
Maybe im just sleepy.

Im getting dizzy, and having flashbacks.
Ive eaten more today than i have in the past week.
Not because i was hungry. but because thee was food.
That probably plays a small role in this Act 2: manic depressive day.

Garr. im not even making sense any more am i?

pfffft.
ill be on aim tomorrow. donno what time though.

im sorry you guys have to hear me pout, but now that i have conveniant internet axcess again, there will be much more of this, i assure you.
So you if you cant take the heat get out of the kitchen.

"event","davids sister makes me crazy.
im not allowed to do a damn thing that i want to do living there, without getting bitched at for hours.

newest developement.

Our friends cat died. The cat had 4 kittens, that are only about a month old.
So i rescued them, and have been bottle feeding them and whatnot.
Missy has decided that 2 of the kittens (one being the one that david and i want to keep) are going to belong to her 3 year old sons.
yes. 3 year olds.
Of the the 3 year olds, likes to beat up on furbank, the cat im watching.
actually, one time i was pretty damned sure that the stupid brat mightve broken poor banksies ribs.

WHY DO 3 YEAR OLDS NEED KITTENS?!?!?!

WEll, me being the kitten lover i am, have been letting the kittens sleep in my room. they were up very late last night, so naturally i was too, to try and take care of them.
Come 8am, when i have to wake up to watch missys son (while shes still home, mind you) im exausted. so i ask her if i can go back to sleep for maybe an hour.
She of course, flips a fit.
Im not going to be babysitting for her anymore. i cant take it.
shes fully capable of taking care of her own damned kids. she doesnt work.
or do anything but bitch at me and everyone else around her.


So anyways, my point....

I need to get out of here for a week. thats all. just a little bit of time to clear my head, and escape the tryanny of my dictator roomate.

Does anyone want to pick me up? gas money would be given upon our arrival back in rochester.
For those who dont know, i live in a small town about 7 miles away from SUNY fredonia, about an hour southwest of buffallo.

"event","I definately have to be at my job interveiw in less than an hour.
Might i add that david and i make quite the cute phantom & christine duo?

Im excited. i really hope i get this fuggin job.
YEah, i promised myself that i wouldnt be caught dead flippin motherfucking burgers,
But Wendys is higher up in the fast food chain that mckydees or BK lounge.

Man, i Really hope this is one of those interveiws where they tell you wether or not you got
hired as soon as your done, instead of making you wait a week or more for them to call you and tell
you that you just waited a week + to not get a job.

Plus, wendys food is good. and if i get hired, ill probably get free shit. and then 
get fat.
Meh.

I need to eat, and then make sure i have everything that im going to need.

Wish me luck, fuckheads =9"

"event","im unhappy.
i dont know if its the overcast day,
the fact that david probably wont be home untill its to late to cash my check,
or if its because im starting to hate living here, and missing rochester like hell,
but whatever it is, its making me depressed.

I want to get out of the house, but i cant untill david gets back, and that probably wont be for at least another hour or 2.

I feel so stupid.
I miss my dad. I miss my serogate mother and stepfather (who comes back from Iraq in a week!)
I miss all of my brothers.
I miss wreaking havok in rochester with alex and mark, when it felt like we owned that whole city.
I miss going to school. Though it would be pointless for me to go back to highschool right now. But i am considering going for some vocational type deal.
Or just retaking the SATS and taking the ACTs.

I dont know. theres very little for me to do with all of my limitations.
I dont really have any friends out here.
I do, but not friendships that i would really consider true friendships.
People that i see on the weekends for a few hours dont really count.
Im talking about the people that can automatically pick up when somethings wrong, and will try to make you feel better.

The only person i have like that is david.
Right now its pretty sad that were the only thing that keeps eachother going.

Fuck this. Im going back to sleep. I can think of nothing else better to do.
David will wake me up when he gets home. By then i hope its not too late to do anything with the money ive been waiting about 4 years to get.

So long, and goodnight."

i had some crazy awesome dreams though.

some werent good dreams, but i can cope with that.

found out that the friday im supposed to be getting picked up to go to rochester,
10,000 maniacs are playing like, right around the corner from us.
i wanna go, but i wont be able to unless i can convince andy that he wants to go,
and then stay the night here, then go back to rochester.

"event","hopefully ill be visiting rochester for a week on friday.
get to spend time with mom and my dad. hopefully chris and josh too.

i need to spend sometime away from this place.
its fun sometimes...but often things here remind me of why i left rochester.
my reasons for staying here i fear are starting to wither.
not that i really have anywhere else to go...

but im not sure that im happy.
thats probably not good. usually im 100% sure of wether or not im content.

i dont know.
things have changed.
i dont feel how i think i should feel.

which is why i need to go to rochester for a little while.
get away from everything so that i can clear my head a little bit.

david needs to tell me whatever the fuck hes been keeping from me all day.
i just got real worried all of a sudden.
kind of feels like im going to passsss out.

guess that means my update is finished."

"event","fucking police.
they want to raid the apartment for NO FUCKING REASON.
We dont sell drugs. Or alcohal. Or cheap sluts.
I guess barbs dip shitt little brother threw a hissey fit because we didnt know where to find weed and told the cops that we were selling it out of this house.
The police talked to barbs dad, told her what was going on, she got ahold of jojo, and the ball rolled from there.

This is ridiculous.

I guess theyre planning on this big bust type deal soon,
however litte do they know theyre not going to find SHIT!
we didnt do anything fuckign wrong, but i have a bad feeling that barbs little brother or scotty, or some other asshole who doesnt like jojo has or will try to plant something on us.

So tonight, we clean and search the house.

If we find anything questionable, regaurdless of whose it is or where it mightve come from, it gets thrown out.

Im not going to tolerate this in my own fucking house.
I wouldnt be so worried if i was dealing with rochester cops.
But fredonia cops are ASSHOLES.

*sigh*

From now on NO ONE is allowed over unless everyone agrees on them being here, for every instance.
Someone stays awake here at all times to guard the shit out of this place.

soon ill be going over to matts to drop off a tattoo sketch and a cd for him. need to talk to him too.

but for now im going to try and relax, while covering all angles of this thing.

FUCKING RIDICULOUS!"

im severely depressed.
so is david.
seemingly weve been making eachother quite unhappy lately.

were dirt poor.
dont know how were going to make rent this month when we cant really even afford gas and food.

my dad lied to me again. i havent seen a damned cent of my social security checks.
probably wont either.

wow.

i cant even find words anymore.

david and i had a nice time together, but things may be different when he gets home.
firstly, depends on how things went at the lawyers, and his mothers house.
secondly, depends wether or not i want to be a jealous bitch.
i found out that he kept something from me, and confronted him about it.
then i gave him a chance to come clean on anything else that i should but didnt know about.
And he said there was nothing.

But there was.

Now i can chose to let it go...
Or let him know exactly how badly some things have been bothering me lately.
Because some of the things ive endured with/for him, lately have been tearing me apart.

But last night was good. i was focused....aware. appreciative.
Perhaps for now i should focus more on that. and less about everything else in life.
And i should sleep. Have not done that yet.

Well then, bye."

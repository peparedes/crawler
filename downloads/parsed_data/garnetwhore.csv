"event","If you are interested, I have a Home Depot card with $78.95 in credit that I am looking to unload. If someone were willing to trade $50 cash for it I would be very happy to meet you somewhere to exchange, and it would be a BIG help to me. I am trying to get funds together for moving expenses, medication and gas money. Also, <lj user=""stollman""> has a very shiny silver PalmOS LifeDrive device he is looking to sell at a huge discount. It is in virtually mint  condition. If you are interested in either the card or the Palm please comment here or call my cell phone at (925) 413-0908 and we can get details to you.

Oh! If you didn't already know, <lj user=""stollman""> and I are moving to Arizona. I <i>REALLY</i> don't want to, but this is how things are at the moment, and fighting it is just wasting my time and energy. In order to preserve my sanity and hope, I am looking on it as a temporary thing until I get myself together enough move back to the Bay Area. I have been in Super Hermit mode for many moons now dealing with all manner of crap, but once we are moved things should improve greatly. If you have evidence to the contrary please don't present me with it, k? ;P
*hugs to all the lovely people I haven't communicated with in ages*
(And hugs to the few that I have.) =]"

So, in case you do not know (which you probably don't), I am going on a trip for about 3 weeks next month.  From November 6th to 23rd I will be traveling around Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.  I will endeavor to not contract malaria or <i>something else</i> as I make my way across Southeast Asia, drinking, smoking, whoring, doing lines off the taut asses of pool boys, and generally being an Ugly American.  I also hope to not get arrested, maimed or shot.

This means I am going to actually be using my Live Journal.  I know you were not prepared for this, it has probably caused a few of you to go into cardiac arrest, and for this I apologize.  Feel free to unfriend me after the bypass.  For those of you who choose to stick around, this is your chance to find out how boring I really am.  There will be no pool boys."

"event","I never post in my livejournal (you are imagining this). This non-post is only here so people have a way to comment and thus get in touch with me, if for some bizarre reason they want to and don't have a better way.  All comments are screened, so feel free to say whatever you want, you naughty thing.  :)

<small>I fear posting.</small>

Edit:  So, I finally figured out this screening thing and if you want your comment to remain screened, but would like a reply from me, say so and leave an e-mail address.  If you don't care if it becomes public when I respond, don't say so.  I think you get what I mean. :)

<small>I still fear posting</small>"

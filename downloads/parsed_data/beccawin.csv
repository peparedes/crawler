getting ready for a divorce next month. as well as finalizing property and finances.  and all i want to do is take naps....

and restless.  i hate that one.

"event","Yes, friends.  I have dropped the biology class.  It was so gross and upseting.  And to top it off, I had no need for it.  As soon as I switched out of nursing, it should've been dropped.  But nooooooo.  I kept it to prove that I can finish it.  But, principles take priority now. Plus, it is nice to have break and enjoy friends, movies, books, charlotte and a little vegging (not in that order.)  
On top of working on appraisals, calling attorneys and C.P.A.s, typing responses, etc. etc.

Writing some wicked poetry lately.  BEst work done under suffering, right?  So true.

"event","just came back from picking up charlotte this morning.  at 7:28 a.m., as her father was walking up to the police station in downtown L.B., he calls me on my cell phone to tell me that he just noticed charlotte with her shirt off for the first time (WHAT!?), and saw that her stomach ""is big"".  ""What are you feeding her?  How many vegetables does she eat a day?""  

I am terrified!  He is now using this as a way to get at me.  and he is going to destroy charlotte's self-image in the process if he keeps this up!  I know that his father is brutal to people who are overweight, and he will have no problem telling her he thinks she is fat.  

It's funny, I just watched ""Real Women Have Curves"", last night.  Cute film.

So, he asked me, very firmly, to e-mail with a list of how many veggies charlotte's eats everyday.  I told him that she has her flinestones vitamin, and is with WIC. Other than that, I tried not to interact with him.  I wanted to avoid another blow-out in front of our daughter.  

Ready for the punchline?  As he was leaving, he pulled out a chocolate bunny from his pocket and gave it to her!  Makes no sense!  He is just plain stupid, or trying to bait me for another fight.  I stayed in control and didn't remark on the chocolate bunny, after he lectured me about charlotte's weight.  

I came home, and e-mailed him a LARGE download of dept. of agriculture's food pyramid guidelines for 2-6 year olds.  Duh. Right back at you, stupid-a&!

Just gotta maintain control and do what I can to keep charlotte's self-esteem from being tarnished.  She is only 3!  She loves her tofu hot dogs, and p.b. & j.  
But he doesn't need to know anything. He is too self-absorbed anyhow."

Unbelievable.  I don't think I caught her dipping an egg...so she still hasn't done it yet.  always next year.

came home and snuck in a jog around the neighborhood.  charlotte cried for about an hour.  oh well.  Later tonight, she dyed more eggs with her cousins (and mom).
Now the easter bunny is on the way.

I am trying to focus on my studies of the sheep heart.  Was horrified to find out that there are cats in certain of the closets that I discovered in the laboratory in the bio class.  I just want the nightmare to end.  
What I HAVE gained from this semester, besides more structure to my life, is meeting new people.  Fascinating, amazing people.  Dave is one of them.  He is funny, bright, understanding, and has tons of character.  He surfs, hikes, sky dives, has his pilot's license, used to strip for fun in his earlier years!   Facinating!
 He has hit the bottom pit of life, and climbed back up to it's top.  His face lights up every time he talks about his girlfriend.

 We have music in common, a quirky humor, and are both members of the ""I am a divorcee"" club.  He is a great listener, and is completely candid about his life experince's.  Whether or not we keep in touch after this semester, I am enjoying his company now.  And that is something I have learned. I understand now that I won't maintain relationships with everyone that have come across in my life and has touched me.  I do think about each and every one of them.  
 I appreciate that they were there in the place and time of my life.  It made sense.  Although it is bittersweet, I simply value the memories of those who have touched my life.  And I white knuckle those who are currently are in my life that have history and consistency with me.  I truly love them. 

off from work tomorrow.  wow!

gonna go read myra's and heather on fanfic now."

"event","Dear Wilbur,

As you lay on my back porch, swimming in your chemicals, i wanted to let you know that I am sorry that i will be cutting you open on monday.
I currently have a C average in my biology class, so if I refused you, I would fail.  There goes my GPA and my priority registation.  Then, CSULB would not be too happy with that, and so I will be stuck in a city college for another 10 years.  Meanwhile, my daughter and I will STILL be living with family, when all we want to do is invite and entertain our friends to our apartment, serving them vegitarian dishes.

So you see Wilbur, my hands are tied.  Just like your little hooves on the dissection pan.  I respect that you have given yourself to science, and us lowly, pathetic city college students.  

I will do my best to give you a proper burial when I have finished throwing up and snipping away at your intestines.

Yours Respectfully,

Amy"

"event","it's friday.  this whole week has been potty training.  however, as soon as charlotte came home from her dad's overnight visit this past tuesday night, she has REFUSED the toliet.  makes me think......

Her father keeps mailing me court documents and responses.  the latest is that he claims that i shouldn't get anything in our divorce because i took out $5,000.00 in our joint account when i left him.  um, that was half of what we had.  i left him with $5,000.00.
It is so comical.  He continues with that he cannot afford to pay my attorney's fees, etc. because he has nothing left.  

And the punchline?  he digresses by accusing me of creating tension for our daughter, and that i have been the one who has not cooperated in this divorce. He claims to have wanted to to settel outside of court, but I had unreasonable demands.

All this is PURE, CLASSIC projection!  It is so funny, and creepy.  The best part is that he is afraid of me.  I have power and he knows it.  

This weekend, i look forward to sitting down and responding to his crazy accusations and lies.  I have much to say.  And an appropriate way to say it.  He really sets himself up.

All in all, I don't want any of this power.  this game is exhausting.  and he is affecting charlotte.  i am so sick of it.
It is really a learning experince and challenge to try to balance and seperate stress and my ex-husband in my life.  TO try to not have it consume me and roll over into my being takes much focus.  Especially when there is a child crying and acting out in my every day life.  
Running has help me so much with my focus and self-mediation.  It is almost healing my spirit.  How corny is that!

On a different spin,  it has just occured to me, when myra goes to europe, will she be logging in her travels with all of us on the internet?  oooo, what fun that will be for us americans over here."

As soon as i told her, a few stray students swarmed around her.  She began to ask me too many questions.  First, it was why the court date.  Then it was why the divorce. After that, there were the comments and opinions.  It was awkward.  

She then stressed that i will be missing an important class.  ""It is the day we disect the fetal pig.  I suggest you buy it now and practice at home.""

I just spent $33.00 on an aborted fetal pig.  It is a boy.  And it has spots.  I am horrified.  I almost puked when i opened the box to discover him in a air tight bag, swimming in fluid.  I feel so uneasy.  He is on my back porch right now.  And i have to open him up!  I feel like crying.

Hope heather is feeling better.  At least she got sick around the weekend so that she has 2 days to rest. Jeff better be taking good care of her.....

Myra's dad has the car for a vegas weekend?!  And why didn't he swing by to pick me up?

can't wait to see what myra does to her hair.  

On friday night, Charlotte and I headed to downtown long beach and visited Michelle and friend's cafe.  It is so new that they don't even have barbecue sauce or straws!  Amazing!  I loved the food.  And Charlotte ate everyting on her plate, which is weird for a 3 year old.  Michelle charmed the pants off my kid, perhaps.  As i forcefully gave Michelle my debit card, i was disappointed to notice that on credit card transactions don't have a place to give a tip.  I owe her.

I must confess, being in downtown was so enjoyable.  I love that city.  The energy and ocean breeze.  It really feels like home to me.  Yet, it was very hard to be at because that once was my home.  Charlotte kept associating it with her dad, which was challenging because I didn't want to mislead her to think she was going to see him.  
Although it has been a year since I have left Po, and I know that the relationship is over, it was a creepy, sad feeling going down there.  However, as the saying goes, I have to take it back.  I will make it my city again, and own it.  Witout him.  It takes time.

It has been a potty training weekend.  Charlotte has peed 2x thus far.  lots of reading time in that bathroom.  so boring!

then, last night she got sick.  grrrrrrr........

she keeps having nightmares about ""bugs in my bed"".  we need to get an ant farm or something to over come this bug fear.

got school tomorrow.  time to make a call to the attorney to prep and avoid another fight this tuesday.

haven't worked out in 2 day.  feel it. totally gross.

"event","i got through today. Reading Mayra's encouraging words, and heather's loving support, helped me tons.  I am a sucker for affirmations.  And when I read, ""there is darkness before dawn"", that really hit me. It is very true.  I am usually pretty positive, but i can let the worst take over. This time in my life, i have been challenged.  

I am still licking my wounds from earlier this week. I am really dreading this tuesday with charlotte's dad, and doing an exchange with him. The fighting that occured over something so completely stupid, and charlotte had to eyewitness the whole event.  I hated it.  
I have decided to take the matter into my own hands because i certainly cannot trust him to cooperate.  In order to avoid charlotte having to experince another fight, I will be at the drop off this tuesday at 5pm.  Although the court has issued it to be 6pm, Po won't listen, nor does respect this.  And it isn't a matter of giving him what he wants, it's about problem solving and taking control of my stressful situation.  I had a friend share with me tonight when i told her my decision, that she is concerned that this will encourage him to continue to bully me for him to get his way.  I see it differently.  I pick and choose my battles.  I don't think this one is worth fighting.  It is totally stupid.  For charlotte's sake, i will GIVE him that extra hour.  If it is a battle over something much more servere, I would be at the front of the line with my boxing gloves on.  And i know I have done that.  I have fought him and kicked his arse.  I will continue to do so.  
As they say, however, the best revenge is happiness.  I want to be happy and attempt to be stress-free.  This isn't worth it to me. I am gaining the self-discipine and control again.

I am trying to pick myself up after my lousy grade on the midterm last week.  I just wanna read my books about divorce and child development, then watch the pile of dvds i have rented that are collecting dust on top of my t.v.  Instead, i am trying to understand enzymes and microbiology. gross.

"event","Well, last night was a stressful night.  As I was getting charlotte ready for her overnight with her dad around 5pm, i get a call on my cell.  It is the ""dumb ex"".  He is claiming that I need to be at the drop-off at now, rather than the court ordered time of 6pm.  
Now, I will not drain my energy, nor waste anyone's time going over the petty, exhausting details that occured last night.  I am getting so drained of it all.  Tired of even thinking about him and this whole situation.  I just want simplicity and mundane. I miss it so much.  
Things did not go so smoothly last night.  And charlotte witnessed the encounter. It was a very depressing experince.  Looking at her big brown eyes, watching her mom and dad exploding at eachother.  What is the moral of this story?  Well, there are times in our lives when we wish, and want, to tell off someone (whomever that may be at that moment of time) because we are so angry with them.  There is so much that one pent up inside of them.  And there are so many principles you want to point out.  
Well, for the past few years, especially this past year, I have bitten my bottom lip and taken lots of deep breaths.  I have said nothing to him.  No responses to his argumentative approach, his passive aggressive behavior, and disturbing ""parenting"" techniques.   But last night, I cracked.  I said what I wanted to say in that moment.  I feel like crap.  It is so much more rewarding to be in control of oneself.  It is so empowering.  I really felt that difference last night.   Gotta be back on track and stay focused.......and say nothing more to him.  
This morning's pick was brief. I tried not to acknowledge him.

Went to school today.  School is closed.  I am trying to make up for my lousy mid-term grade.  I then ventured over to ""Stoledo's Cafe"" for lunch.  As I pulled up, I noticed that it still has not opened.  Sigh.  I went to 2nd street for lunch, instead.  
Now I am home, waiting for my daughter to come home with our aunt, and i am going to ""study"" all about the central nervous system.  I hope I won't fall asleep.  

Looking forward to my afternoon walk.  The best time to go is when the sun is a bit hazy. It is hard to describe it, but the hour of 4-5pm is a beautiful time of late afternoon.  That is, if you are not stuck in traffic and you have the oppurtunity to go for walks in the park.  

I hope Jeff's interview went well.  

Am excited that Mayra's going to europe.  so much that i feel like I am going with her.  I can climb into her trunk, and she can punch a hole in it for me.  And Fred can lose the key, and Ricky can play the drums on top of my head wihout knowing I am in there."

For the past 2 days, ever since charlotte came back from her weekend with her dad, she has been prancing around telling everyone that, ""mom is taking daddy's house away.""  I have had the anxiety attack, and have made the call and left a message with her therapist.  However, i really don't know how to handle the situation. 
My immediate response and reaction is to call her father up and scream at him, ""What are you thinking?!  How dare you, sicko!""  I am so pissed off that I want to go his front door and punch him in his face.  
He knows that the only way to get to me is through our 3 year old.  He a sick man.  He wants that reaction from me.  I am not gonna give it to him. 
I have reassured her that I am not taking her dad's home away for the past 2 days.  
On the way home from my walk in the park with her, she again expressed that I am taking her dad's home away.  I turned around in my driver's seat as i pulled into our driveway and told her that ""I am not taking your dad's home away.  Charlotte, next time you hear dad say something about mommy, you tell him, ""No!  Don't talk about mommy.""  Charlotte seemed to enjoy this responce because she had the biggest grin across her cherub cheeks.  I hate to pull her into this, but I have to teach her to be assertive and to place solid boundaries with people who are dangerous.  What a challenge to do this with a 3 year old who cannot really comprehend too much.

Before the we rolled up our sleeves to make them this evening, I stole the oppurtunity to go the park with charlotte and the new 5K jogging stroller. (I walk/run/huff-puff)  As I was strolling along, tuning out charlotte's whining with my headphones, I noticed amongst the people with their dogs on their leashes, I found a elderly woman amongst the sea of wagging tails and droopy dog tounges with her cat on a leash!  It made my whole day!  It was so different to see, and so strange. 

Earlier in the day, I had to wrestle, emotionally, with my 3 year old crying for her dad.  She claims to really miss and want him.  Oh the feelings of guilt and disgust.  
I thought the most appropriate response to her confliction and sincere yearning was to call her dad at his work for her to get her reassurance.  
So i did it.
The next thing I knew, as I was sitting there on the carpet with my daughter talking to her dad on my cellular phone, and heard her ask her dad for ""julie"".  ""I want julie"".  Ouch.  Now, I really have no reaction to hearing the name of my ex-husband's mistress, but to hear my daughter request to see her was paralyzing.  Very bizzare feeling. I look forward surpassing this phase with her.

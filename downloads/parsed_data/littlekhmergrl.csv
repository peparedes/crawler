i shouldnt have led you on the way i did. i took your heart, played

that i am a flirt at times.. most of the time, and that's something
that i gotta change. i love you and im always here for you if you ever
need me for anything. and dont be sorry for ignoring me.. cuz i totally
deserved it. you're my friend and you always will be no matter what. i
will never be mad at you, only at myself. to tell you the truth i did
like you somewhat.. but i dont know what happened.. it's just like
kristina said im a ""crush whore"" i just change who i like alot..but..
you shouldnt give up.<span style=""color: rgb(0, 128, 255);"">sometimes
love doesnt go the way you want it to. sometimes your heart gets

chance to catch it.. or&nbsp; you could end up finding&nbsp; another
that is more perfect, more to your liking. dont give up hope. cuz

A WALK DOWN MEMORY LANE</span><br>
<br>
<br>
it's been awhile snice we last talked<br><br>
so let's take this time to walk<br><br>
let's go down memory lane<br><br>
back to when we first learned each other's name<br><br>
we were so young, so alive<br><br>
best friends you and i<br><br>
so many memories<br><br>
so little time to be free<br><br>
we were wild<br><br>
as crazy as every other child<br><br>
we told lies that made others cry<br><br>
but in the end we always apologized<br><br>
we forgave and forgot<br><br>
we helped each other alot<br><br>
then came middle school<br><br>
we went our seperate ways which wasn't cool<br><br>
we hardly saw each other<br><br>
i thought i lost you forever<br><br>
three years there<br><br>
and two years here<br><br>
now we're juniors in creek<br><br>
you and i are finally talking<br><br>
and im glad that once again<br><br>
you and i have become friends</font></span>"

"event","so yesterday, i got bored around 12 am, and decided to go thru the closet and i found some trucker books. they weren't like huge or anything, anyway, being bored as i was, i sat down and skimmed thru them. here's one thing i actually read:

""angels on the road""
    ""ever heard folks discussing what they read in newspapers? perhaps you, like many others, think that just because you read something in black and white print, it must be true. why? keep in mind that newspaper writers are human like everyone else, and while they strive to do their jobs accurately, they do make mistakes. just because it's in the paper does not make it God's own truth.
    plus, you may need to read ""between the lines"" on occasion rather than only reading the surface print. like in the story i came across about a special task assignment issued by a particular county in my area. a major interstate runs through the heart of that county, and as such, the police were doing a weekend crack-down on truckers who tailgate. officers in unmarked cars were going out, spotting these bumper-riders, videotaping them in the act, then sending out marked cars to pull them over for tickets. the videotape would then be used in court as evidence of guilt.
    here's the kicker - one participating officer was noted as saying: ""using unmarked cars is an excellent idea since truckers act like perfect angels when marked cars are around."" hmmm... that may be true, but hello? who doesn't abide by every rule while a cop is around?! i hardly think that bit of common sense is limited to truckers. after all, ever see anyone driving along an interstate, passing a cop doing 20mph faster than he is? might as well wave a flag out the window that says ""hey, look ate me - i'm speeding."" rather, you find a traffic jam of folks 100 feet behind him, afraid to even get close, much less go any faster""

there was more to that. but it was pointless to add it in. anyway, i so agree with the writer, who wouldn't be a perfect little angel on the road when they know a cops around? lol. another thing that caught my attention was this recipe for chili (for all them hardcore cowboys out there =P):

""midnight cowyboy's award winning deep south texas chili""

utensils and food items required:
    1 big skillet and 1 large pot with lid
    3lbs ground chuck
    5 cans del monte mexican stewed tomatoes
    (puree 3 cans in blender and leave 2 cans tomatoes as is)
    1 3oz container chili powder
    3 Tbs. cumin
    3 Tbs. oregano
    3 Tbs. garlic powder
    2 big dashes worchestershire sauce
    2 big dashes pickapeppa jamaican sauce (available at all leading supermarkets)
    1oz of favorite barbecue sauce
    2 big dashes A-1 bold (hot and spicy writeen on label)
    1/2 medium onion (chopped)
    salt and pepper

    in the skillet, brown ground chuck with chopped onion and salt and pepper and garlic powder; drain. in large pot, mix all ingredients listed above and then pour in ground chuck. place lid on pot and heat over a small flame for at least two hours, stirring mixture regularly.
    as with any authentic chili makers, use your own ideas in adding tasteful items to this basic recipe. suggested SIDE DISHES to use with prepared chili include chopped onion, chopped jalapeno peppers, and/or grated cheese.

so those 2 things were about all i was interested in from those trucker books. anyway, wrote a little poem:

""tired of waiting""

im tired of waiting
tired of searching for that one special guy
the one who's supposedly right for me
im tired of wondering what he's like
is he mean or is he nice?
when is he gonna come into my life
and make everything right?
when will he be mine?
what's his name?
is he white, black, mexican ore asian?
tell me his current location
so i can find this guy now
i need to know who he is
i gotta check him out
and see if he's right for this little chick
im done waiting
somehow, someway
i'll find the man of my dreams
ima find by the end of this day
gonna get this over with
so i can stop searching
so i can stop wondering who he is
and finally meet the perfect guy for me

so yes, that' my little poem. and to answer those who actually read this whole entire post form beginning to end, yes.. i was/am that bored. but you must be even more bored to have had read this whole thing. =P and btw, im not done yet. keep reading! lol. just revently found out my brother says ""dude"" not that it's a crime or anything, but it sounds funny coming from him. and plus, i used to say it (but i don't anymore cuz i don't like to say it, but i don't care if you say it i just don't like to say it =P) anyway, so i used to say it, and he used to be a hater and bug the crap out of me when i said it.. so should i do the same to him? i mean what goes around comes around right? lol. naw, im not that mean. =P 19 days and school will be back in session.. so who's ready for school? im not. =P i haven't even read my summer reading yet.. i didn't even buy it yet. .. bleh .. i don't like reading.. i guess that's all for now.. im done. hehe. i seriously doubt anyone read this entire thing from start to finish.. but w/e, who am i to force you guys to read something against your will? and i myself, one who dislikes reading. =P well i love you guys anyway even if you didn't read this.

"event","hrm.. let's see.. who knows jacob rodriguez? anyway.. so yesterday the guy comes over, and everyone tells him to go away. we leave him knocking on the door for like ten minutes.. it was so effin funny. that loser could've just gone through the garage. he's so stupid sometimes. today, i went to monica's place in the morning.. mon's my cousin btw. we were there from 10:30 to 1. the brats went psycho on me.. they kept hitting me for no apparent reason.. anyway, it was fun seeing my cousins again. got home around 2:30. my dad left for work around 3. mom left around 4:30. jacob calls asks to talk to robert (cousin) i tell him robert's asleep. jacob tells me to wake him up. i tell him i don't want to. jacob asks why. i say i don't feel like it. then he asks me if i knew who i was talking to on the phone.. i said i had a pretty good guess, so he asks me who he was. i tell him he's jacob.. he says yep asks me if he came over would i let him in to wake up robert, i say.. sure.. w/e and we hang up. bout five minutes later, he comes knocking on my door. i open it. looked at him. and waved bye, and shut the door. then i open it again and tell him i was just kidding,and let him in. he says i like to play around too much.. he goes to wake my cousin up, then blah blah blah happened. he leaves.. blah blah blah again. my cousin says to never let jacob back into the house b/c .. i guess something that had to do with shoes and my uncle's bed.. idk.. i didn't really pay attention.. so my cousin wants me to be all mean and aggressive to jacob and tell him to fuck off next time he comes.. except.. am i a mean person? no. i can't do that... hrm.. i'll probably just make him stand at the front door all day, begging to come in.. heheh... 

i guess that's it for now

no matter how many times i try
i cant get you out of my mind

you are everything to me
everything that i want and need
at first it was unclear
but now i know i want you here
i need you here in my life
you are all i think about day and night
you are who i want by my side
you are the one i want to make mine
i never thought i'd ever feel this way for you
but somehow i came to love you
each day i await your visit
i know it seems like i hate it
but truth is, i love it when you're here
a day without you is a day i can't bear
no matter how many times i say it isn't true
truth is, i love you

""you came and took my heart away""

you came into my life
took my heart away
stayed by my side
every single day
told me you loved me
that you wanted no other
now you're leaving
saying you found someone better
came and left like it was no big deal
left me here in a pool of tears
with wound that will never heal
and pain that is too much to bear
you came into my life
took away my heart
and left me to cry
after you ripped it apart
going on with your life
pretending you never knew me
making up lies
to cover up everything
how could you do this to me
how could you break my heart
and go on pretending
like nothing's wrong at all


ok i have to go now. so enjoy

"event","wow.. i just got thru babysittin the most annoying kids ever.. my lil bro, my lil sis, and my two nephews.. well.. actually two were good little angels but the other two were evil little devils. if you must know, my youngest nephew and my brother were the devils. i couldn't even hear the t.v and it was on pretty loud.. they made a huge mess.. and my nephew kept hitting me.. damn that kid hits hard as hell.. at least my cousin paid me.. only five bucks tho.. i think i should've argued for more considering how long they left me with those brats.. but i was too lazy to do that. it's oddly quiet now that they've left.. well.. guess that's all for now.."

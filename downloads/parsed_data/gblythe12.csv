"event","so i've joined heather in giddy land.  the guy i'm currently interested in called me today and asked me to do something tonight, so i'm all excited, probably over excited, but hey you're only young once!  i'm in such a good mood, ahhh.

i'm off to albuquerque tomorrow with my mom to check out unm and stuff, i'm kind of excited about that too cuz it feels good to have this to fall back on since i can't go to uvm. and it won't be so bad, it might work out for the best. wow, see what kind of optimism a guy can bring to me, ha, weird."

"event","so i just now saw heather's comment in my last entry saying i dont update.  i guess i'm still new at this, i forgot i had it, oops.  also, i'm definately not online as much as i am at school and until recently nothing interesting was going on with me to write down.  all that has changed, thank God. i was really starting to go mad.  i finally have friends here. i met Tina trough my stepdad (ironic isn't it) and she took me out with her friends and now i have plenty of friends and plenty to do!  i just got back last night from a weekend trip to colordo and let me tell you, it was some of the most fun i've had in a really long time.  there was originally five of us going but two people backed out at the last minute, fortunately we talked someone new into going. so it's tina, chris, daron, and myself (they're all 22, small bummer for me being the only one underage). tina is a total sweetheart and a lot of fun, chris is just wonderful all around, and daron is one of the funniest people i've ever met, the trip may not of been even half as entertaining without him. anyone who cares to know more detail can call me :)

on a completely different note: as most people may know already, i can't afford to come back to uvm. i've decided to stay here and go to unm in albq.  my mom thinks she can get me in for the fall with her ""connections"" but i dont care. i'm satisfied with starting in the spring. until then i guess i might stay here and work, or maybe get a place in albq. and work there, then i can keep my job when i start school. i havent worked out the kinks yet, but that's what i know so far.  it saddens me to think that i may never see my friends in vermont again. i'm really disappointed that i can't ever go back to uvm, but i'm trying really hard to be optimistic about this new change.  chris will be at unm and i'll have my other friends here, maybe it will work out.  i will do my best to visit, i mean there are just certain people i couldn't stand not seeing for too long.  and of course anyone could come see me here ;)  anyway, i love my friends in the east and i hope to see them all again very soon."

"event","i really know how to over do it sometimes, don't i?  sometimes i'm such a mix of crazy emotions that i can't even figure myself out so i don't know how you people can stand me!  anyway, i feel pretty good today.  i'm long over whatever crap i was spewing in that last entry.  i'm just a true drama queen at heart, i guess.  today was good because the mother and the evil stepfather were gone all day; it was glorious.  i also talked to my best friend from home, Jess, and my best friend from school, Heather, and Joe.  Oh, no one knows who Joe is.  well, he's a good influence; let's just leave it at that for now!  so mark today in history folks ( i know, it's already marked: the 60th anniversary of D-Day, but work with me), a day when i was stuck in this place, but still managed to be keep a good mood going.  thanks to those of you that helped make that possible. you're the ones who know just how difficult it is for me to be happy here."

"event","well, i've had an interesting day.  i never intended to get into a crazy argument, nor did i expect what i heard, so i guess it makes sense.  i do this a lot....reach out of my league and then crash down into to despair (that's a little anne of green gables for ya) when i get hurt.  you'd think i'd learn by now, but we none of us ever do.  i'm hurting a lot right now, but only because of my own stupidity.  it's funny....one moment i blame myself entirely for my own troubles, which makes sense because in a lot of ways it is my fault, but the next moment i can't help being angry with someone else.  it's human nature i guess, we never want to admit when we're at fault, there's always someone else to blame.  it makes it hard though because he wants to be friends.  part of me does too, obviously, i don't want lose him completely just because of this, but another part of me is a mixture of anger and hurt that doesn't see it as possible because how can i face him.  i know i'll get through it eventually and i know we can be friends, i mean, i want us to be.  but some of the things he said, mostly the things he didn't say to me, they really hurt.  it's like he's two different people.  the part of him that makes me angry....there's only one thing i want to say to that and it's in response to his wanting to be friends.  i'll leave you with it....a classic CAKE song:

To me, coming from you,
Friend is a four letter word
End is the only part of the word,
That I heard.
Call me morbid or absurd,
But to me,
Coming from you,
Friend is a four letter word

To me,
Coming from you,
Friend is a four letter word
End is the only part of the word
That I heard,
Call me morbid or absurd,
But to me,
Coming from you,
Friend is a four letter word

When I go fishing for the words,
I am wishing you would say to me,
I am really only praying that
The words you'll soon be saying
Might betray the way you feel about me.

But to me,
Coming from you,
Friend is a four letter word."

"event","After reading my friends' journals for most of the year, i finally decided to try this thing for myself.  well, school's done and i'm stuck in new mexico with the mom, the brother, and the evil stepdad so life isn't exactly peachy at the moment.  my plan is to have at least 2 jobs, i want as much as i can fit in so i don't have to be in this house too often.  i already miss people like crazy.  i feel like i'm imprisoned here; it's certainly no vacation!  this will be all for my first entry; don't want to bore anyone."

"event","He sees much more than me,

He knows the way to be fine now,

And he's still so similar... 
but above everyone else


How can he know so much about me?
How can he understand?

And still want to be with me?"

"event","It keeps getting darker...
And I keep seeing blood... It's mine, but not really...

When I think I'm saved, I'm back on burning moths...

When I think I'm loved, I get hurt more and more...


I don't understand the truth.

Who was he really? Was it all a lie?"

"event","I've dreamed of someone... he was holding his hand out for me... he just pulled me away from the pain and for the first time in my life I felt I really belong...

He saved me.

But really, it's not pity I need..."

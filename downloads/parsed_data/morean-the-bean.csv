"event","i went to the USC/UCLA game this past weekend. it was fun times. 

there was kind of an intense big last night. my parents started getting after me, telling me that i need to find someone who will take care of me for life, that i get intense about people but that i don't seem to know ""who i am,"" whatever that means. i don't believe in who-i-ams because of all the changing i've been doing. what do i DO. how do i PRACTICE life. these are not questions i get. in the hotel room, i was met with a barrage of questions. after this, when we were supposed to go out to dinner, i said i didn't want to go, that i just wanted to go to sleep. so i stayed and my mom, dad, and sister all left. 

i burst into tears as the door was closing. i felt misunderstood and forced back into an 'identity' that is no longer my own, to a place i have left. i wanted nothing more to call someone who could understand. but i couldn't. =/

a couple minutes later, there was a knock at the door. my mom had returned. she got into bed silently and i could hear her sniffling. i asked her what was wrong, and she said she didn't want to talk about it. she said my sister had said something (i later found out alicea accused my parents of attacking me on the way out of the hotel, and my mom said ""i just want to go give her a hug, i'm going back up""). my mom told me she came back up because alicea had said something hurtful to her. so i don't exactly know why she came back up. but this was my chance to take a risk, to put myself out there, because i knew my mom was not going to. so i asked ""what is hard for you in being a part of this family?"" thus began a two-hour conversation about siblings, love, significant others, living arrangements, and on and on. i had never talked to her like that. 

ayiyi. i'm afraid that to the people who matter most, i'm just a footprint in the surf. ephemeral. momentary. a fading presence. a blurred trace. will i ever be what i once was without looking back? *sigh* but i can never go back to what i was. it wasn't good for anyone.

stress-induced allopecia. it means that when i get stressed, my hair falls out in small patches. i found a small, bare patch of skin this morning, on the top of my head. i need to find ways to let go and relax. i also can't digest anything. not even fruit. everything upsets my stomach. names are etched into patches of the quilt that warms this little heart."

a problem i've been having is with the dichotomization of ""theory"" and ""practice"". i know there is a quote somewhere that tries to hierarchicalize (word?) the two, by saying a little practice is better than a lot of theory. i think what needs to be pointed out is that fact that everyone operates with a theory. the only difference is how well-thought out that theory is. i feel the work i do is important because i am forming a responsible, ethical theory, after which point i can begin to practice the work. i worry about the ghettoization of academic thought and practice within the world of social justice. at the summit this weekend, someone facetiously referred to ""academic issues"" as somehow removed from ""real issues"". what makes academic NOT the ""real world""? how is that not real, for the professors and students who are struggling to come to terms with all the complexities of this world? how is that not real for the people who desperately need that space so that we may have the freedom to think dangerous thoughts? i feel that the classroom is such a dynamic space, in that the main activity is thought and questioning. how is that not powerful and empowering? how is that not practice of defiance against hegemony? how is that not an act of resistance, in and of itself? i wonder about these things."

"event","as always, i've been doing a lot of thinking about sexism, racism, homophobia, feminism, etc. a new one that's been on my mind is classism. well, it's not really new, so much as i've just now opened up my eyes as to how much it really affects how we interact with others on a day to day basis.

think about it in simple terms, i suppose. i noticed it first when people say ""oh man, that's so GHETTO!"" in modern vernacular, a ""ghetto"" is a neighborhood of low socioeconomic status, and it's definitely a pejorative term. isn't that the same as saying ""oh man, that's so GAY!""? i realized that they are definitely related because they take an identity marker (sexuality, where you live) and a value judgment is slapped onto it. clearly, in our society, we place such a strong value on wealth that we look down on those who do not have it. it seems like a simple concept, but i never realized beforehand just how pervasive this type of discrimination is. when we comment on how people wear their clothes, or which clothes they choose to wear, we are being classist. when we gaudily sport name brands, we are being classist because we want others to notice that we can afford to pay for these expensive things, setting us apart from those who cannot afford to pay for such things. i never realized how much i took this type of discrmination as an acceptable form, but it most definitely is not. i am more than at fault for classist acts. i wish we weren't socialized to be so utterly and despicably discriminatory. it's driving me crazy, realizing just how pervasive the issues are. we take every facet of one's identity and we put a value on different categories of identity. straight = good. gay = bad. white = good. non-white = bad. rich = good. poor = bad.

""Overcoming Feminism""


Dear Dr. Laura,

I have a good husband who respects me and cares for me. But I think we both began our marriage somewhat under the influence of modern feminist thought. Soon after we got married I put on about 20 pounds and let my wardrobe be filled with ""comfortable"" clothes that showed as little of my shape as possible. I knew he liked my hair down, but I preferred not to deal with it, so I wore lots of ponytails. He often tried to tactfully help me control my eating habits, but that just led to hurt on my side and frustration on his side. A year after we got married we moved to Egypt, at which point I even stopped wearing makeup. He said he didn't care, it was too hot, who was I going to dress up for with no job and no school, I think you're beautiful no matter what, etc. We both knew he was supposed to be okay with me no matter what, because that's what the world teaches about relationships between men and women. He has always treated me well, but our relationship stagnated a bit as I believe lots of marriage relationships do. 

Well, one day he finally said he wouldn't mind if I started wearing makeup again. Strangely, this made my heart soar. I had been working out regularly for a few months by this time, and really watching my food intake, and it was starting to make a difference. I was relieved to find out that he cared how I looked, and I suddenly became intent on looking nice just for him. I put makeup on every day and began to wear my hair down. We went shopping and bought me clothes that fit my slimming body, and the reaction this caused in him was more rewarding than I ever thought it could be. He couldn't stop smiling and telling me how beautiful I was. He began to come home with gifts for me like handbags and jewelry. He couldn't wait ""parade me around"" as he said, and introduce me to his colleagues and friends. I never felt he was ashamed of me before, but I began to realize how selfish I had been in letting myself go. I saw how happy my efforts made him, and the benefit for me was new clothes, fun gifts, and a husband who was always proud to be by my side. What wife doesn't want exactly these things from her man? We have always tried to fulfill our labor roles to make each other happy, but this fun discovery renewed our relationship and our love for each other. It is good to love and respect, and it is even better to adore and be adored.

B.


**overcoming feminism? as if feminism is responsible for those things? if true feminism really existed, none of the above would even be an issue. 
-and here's another GREAT letter-

""Pro 'Choice' Kept Me Awake Last Night"" 


Last night I did not sleep well. Here is why: Yesterday afternoon I was sitting in the lobby of a beloved dance studio while my daughters had their dance lessons, filling out my absentee voter ballot. I was in the company of a Christian mom and a Catholic mom, plus two other women whose faiths were unknown to me. When the Catholic mom brought up the fact that I was voting, the Christian mom mentioned despairingly that her husband doesn't vote. I said that he had a moral obligation to vote and she nodded in agreement, saying that she would work on that. 

Being the outspoken pro-lifer Dr. Laura - warrior mommy that I am, I said that 20 million Christians in the USA don't bother voting, and that if they did, we could stop abortions. The young receptionist spoke up and expressed her disagreement with me wanting to end abortions, saying that she was pro-choice. I said, ""Then you're pro-DEATH. It's not a choice if the BABY doesn't get to CHOOSE. It's murder."" She did not disagree that it was murder, but that she knew someone who had been raped and become pregnant, etc. (I must admit that I wondered to myself if it was really a rape, or a so-called 'date rape.') I said that 3,500 babies are killed everyday and that most of them have nothing to do with rape. She agreed with that also. Another mother said that maybe my choice was fine for me, but not for everyone. I replied that 20 years ago I would have agreed, but now I know that abortion is just plain wrong. She came back with ""you shouldn't condemn people just because you don't agree with them."" I said that I had not condemned anyone, but that abortion was wrong, just like murder and robbery and prostitution are wrong. 

The Catholic mom and the Christian mom, with a sweet plump baby girl on her lap, remained silent. 

I couldn't sleep last night because the thought of a mother, who bothered to bring her daughter to weekly dance lessons, valued the lives of other women's unborn babies so little. And that the other two moms said nothing. 

Please, people, God did not give you life just so you could take up space. Please, stop playing nice-nice and speak up for your beliefs. It just might save the life of a precious baby. 

Shelly, my daughters' mom and my husband's wife. 

P.S. I've been listening to you since your San Diego days and I love you! 

**""supposed date-rape""???? because there's a difference? rape is rape, no matter what the circumstances are, if it happens between a husband and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend, between two friends, in a back alley...if it's not completely consensual (which means sober!) then it's rape. it's so sad to me that women don't even know what their rights are and then they look down on other women just because they don't know what's permissible and what isn't. 
-AND YET ANOTHER GREAT LETTER!!!-

""Feminist"" Is Oxymoronic 


Dear Dr. Laura, 

Nothing could be more timely than your book, The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands! There is a whole generation of women who ended up being latchkey kids, and the idea of staying at home with their own children seems foreign (as does cooking meals from scratch instead of opening boxes or eating fast food, but I digress). 

I often wondered why you seemed to harp on feminists, but I realize that, to a large extent, their attitudes are shaping the attitudes of young women today. Being a wordsmith, I thought even the word ""feminist"" is oxymoronic. Then I looked it up in the dictionary. The THIRD definition is: ""Feminine Character"".

You hit the nail on the head! They (feminist) seem to be anything but feminine, because the bent is on behaving MANLY. I'm happy to be different from men, and in particular, my husband. We think differently, but complement each other. 

So, in ""uddah woids"", I appreciate the way you gently, and not so gently at times, help to change the way people are thinking, all for the sake (and survival of families). Society teaches people to be selfish, whereas the Bible teaches just the opposite...which, by the way, is the true key to happiness. 

Keep up the good work

**feminists are trying to be men? riiiiiiiight. it's sad that people have power/autonomy so connected to ""manhood"" that they cannot even separate the two concepts into distinct entities. what the hell are we supposed to do with this world? and these are WOMEN writing these things! this is so sad

--AND THEN MY FAVORITE PART was a section where listeners respond to the question ""should women who were molested as children be allowed to marry?"", to which listeners gave different responses, ranging from ""no, becuase then the spouse has to deal with emotional breakdowns, suicide attempts, etc."" to ""maybe, but only if they get lots and lots of therapy so they don't drain anyone.""

Dr. Laura is the devil. enough said."

"event","because of all the ""discussing"" i've been up to, there are so many ideas that have been popping into my head (i just almost typed ""pooping"" instead of ""popping"" hahahaha. there are so many different human rights issues related to the lgbt community that need to be addressed. i've been downloading article after article, mostly from scholarly journals, related to the psychosocial welfare of the lgbt community and it is quite the scary situation. if i had a million degrees, the proper qualifications, the necessary organizational skills, and endless financial resources, i would:

a) find some way to unite all the independent organizations out there that are fighting for marriage equality. so many people are doing so many good things all over, it's just about fighting for this cause are a unified whole. 

b) figure out some way to make the whole lgbt community aware of its own hypocrisy in certain situations. being discriminated against as we are already, we have to be hyper-aware of our own instances when we feel that we are just joking around, but instead perpetuating stereotypes. example: there is a facebook group online headed up by a bunch of liberal students (including some gay males) entitled ""i've decided to become a lesbian to attract more men"". enough said. the fact that there are in fact members of the lgbt community that endorse this type of group somewhat delegitimizes any argument that any other member of the lgbt community might make about the offensive nature of this group. that also brings up my issues with the whole artificial concept of the lgbt community and how diverse it is, but we are generally oppressed in the same way...why can't we at least unite ideologically over that? 

c) start a rehabilitation home for displaced or drug-addicted LGBT youth. the home would focus on mental health (with professional counseling available and mandatory for all), physical health (with helpful nutritionists on staff), accredited highschool teachers if students feel uncomfortable attending public highschool, classes to obtain a GED if highschool is not the best option, information on lgbt rights, empowering workshops on activism and volunteerism, etc. think about what a utopia that would be...

d) a small private college that focuses on lgbt issues and activism/volunteerism. of course we would not discriminate based on sexual identity if heterosexuals applied! as long as they were respectful and willing to involve themselves in the mission statement of promoting lgbt issues, then they would be good to go! supportive allies are key in our struggle for equality. 

anyone have millions of dollars, education, and buildings??? maybe i should put up a craigslist ad...just kidding. i feel like we've become so complacent in our safe little college community. i know i have. i also acknowledge the importance of sometimes shutting out all that negativity to be able to think freely and outside of the box. but i cannot forget about all of those who are trapped in those oppressive environments and don't realize that there truly is hope. i just wish i were more than one person. that's become my motto recently. =("

"event","talking in circles can be fun guys! dispelling load of craptacular misinformation can be fun! check out this argument this guy posted on his myspace, and then my response to it. tell me i'm an idiot, please, just so i can at least sleep knowing the world makes sense and i'm a moron

myspace blog, entited ""your daily dose"" (pretentious, no???):
Can't get enough of the ""same-sex relationships"" controversy? Well get ready and hold on to something because here comes your Daily Dose!
On the afternoon of February 7th, a panel discussion was held in the Ostrander Auditorium on the MSU - Mankato campus. The panel covered many topics, all relating to same-sex issues. These topics included adoption, religion, and, of course, marriage. Another hot topic discussed at the panel was the amendment that is currently going through legislation that would legally define marriage as the union between a man and a woman. 

So far, amendments similar to the one currently in the Minnesota legislature have passed with an overwhelming majority in nineteen states. 

The panel discussion was lead by Scott Fearing, senior director of Outfront Minnesota. I would like to comment on some of Mr. Fearing's remarks, as well as the discussion in whole.

The audience was allowed to ask questions of the panel regarding homosexuality, adoption, religion, discrimination, and the marriage debate. However, I wonder what would have happened if the panel had been asked ""what do you think will be the effects of your child?"" or ""are you afraid that your child will be ridiculed for your lifestyle?""

Adoption has become increasingly popular among same-sex couples. This is a wonderful thing, except for a couple problems. First, the lives of these children can often times be ruled and controlled by the fact that they live with a same-sex couple. The fact that they are adopted is often enough for a child to deal with, but the fact that they live in a homosexual setting, is often traumatizing and can also be depressing for the child.

One of the couples that participated in the panel had a child. It was a lesbian couple and the child was the biological daughter of one of the women. The partner has gone through the process and has adopted the daughter also. I think this is very unfair to the child, as the child has no choice in the matter. Granted that the child is an infant now, but what about when she grows up and realizes that her family is ""different?"" What if she starts to wonder why they say she has ""two mothers?"" This is one thing that annoys me about same-sex couples and children. The child does not, by any means, gain a mother or father because of a same-sex relationship. Just as if a heterosexual couple start a relationship, any children that might be involved do not suddenly have an additional ""mother"" or ""father."" This puts unjust pressure on the child to decide who their real mother is. Indeed, both people involved can play active roles in the child's life, but the child does have a mother, the one that gave him/her life. The title of mother or father must be earned, and cannot simply be given. 

As for some of the comments given by the panel. The audience was asked how many of them had a religion that was opposed to homosexuality, and more than half of them audience raised their hands. Mr. Fearing responded ""well, they shouldn't be passing legislation based on one religion."" It can be assumed that Mr. Fearing is referring to Christianity. However, Mr. Fearing is wrong. Homosexuality is not only considered immoral in the Christian faith, but also in the Islamic faith as well. Basically, I think it is a little presumptuous of Mr. Fearing to assume that this amendment is based on any religion. Yes, many Christians openly confess their feelings on homosexuality and credit those beliefs to their faith, and their faith alone. However, Mr. Fearing refuses to recognize that many people determine their faith by, among other things, their beliefs. Mr. Fearing, as well as many other homosexuals, claim that people determine their beliefs by their religion. While this is true for some people, it is also true that some people's religion is determined by their views, and not the other way around. 

To go further on this topic. Mr. Fearing would like to impress upon the audience that Christians are in a way ""brain washed"" against homosexuality because they are brought up in a Christian setting. I would like to ask Mr. Fearing how this is any different from raising a child in a homosexual setting, and therefore ""brain washing"" them in favor of homosexuality, and probably against religion as well. Many homosexuals openly condemn religion as ""hypocritical."" God, and religion, are not hypocritical, it the people that are hypocritical. God should not be looked down upon because of the acts of people. If a homosexual robs a bank, do we blame the person or homosexuality? Of course the person is responsible for their actions. Jesus indeed loves all, regardless of whatever sin they might have in their lives. That is the beauty about Christianity that people ignore. Instead, people find a way to discredit it, and use some people as an example. Homosexuals call Christians ignorant? It is clear that they are not aware of the teachings of Jesus, and are making assumptions about the faith without confirming these notions, a prime example of ""ignorance."" 

One of the other members of the panel, Eddie Rodriguez, commented ""start thinking for yourself. Keep an open mind and an open heart."" I think if I were to comment on the first part of Mr. Rodriguez's comment, I would be repetitive of the last paragraph. However, the second part of his comment needs looking at. 

""An open mind, and and open heart."" Ok, why do homosexuals and advocates assume that anyone opposed to homosexuality has a ""closed mind"" and those that are in their favor are the enlightened elite who have ""seen the light?"" Maybe people had, and might still have, an open mind towards the issue, but have made up their mind on how they feel about it. An open mind means that you are willing to consider both sides, and still freely make your own decision. While some people have their beliefs dictated to them by outside sources, the majority, by far, has made up their own mind. Just because I am opposed to your views, does not mean I have a closed mind. If I were to ask an athiest what he/she thought about Christianity, I think it can be assumed that their response would be negative. However, does this mean I can claim that they have a ""closed mind?"" Of course not. If snyone refuses to listen to anything disputing their beliefs, that is an example of a closed mind. 

Mr. Rodriguez went on to say that ""it's the fear of what you don't know."" So, the reason anyone is opposed to homosexuality is their ignorance? Mr. Rodriguez assumes that everyone opposed to homosexuality must not know anything about it, and is therefore afraid of it. I think Mr. Rodriguez should ask some more people why they are opposed to homosexuality, and their reasons for that. I can almost guarantee that no one will answer ""uhh, because I don't know what it is."" 

To conclude, I see this panel as a failure as a discussion, and nothing more than blatant propoganda to make the students, all of whom can legally vote, feel guilty if they are opposed to homosexuality, and therefore convincing them to vote against the amendment in the legislature that will go to public vote later this year. In the fall of 2006, the majority of the public will decide whether or not homosexuals should be allowed to marry in the state of Minnesota. And that's your Daily Dose of Reality for February 10th! 

***sorry that crap was so long, there here was my response: 

1) calling it a ""homosexual lifestyle"" is highly offensive. it is a LIFE. and the entirely life is not homosexual, that just happens to be the sexual orientation of the individual. does this feature shape the life? not entirely. i happen to have many straight friends and i spend more time around straight people than i do around ""those homosexuals"". 

2) APA approved psychological studies have again and again proven that there are absolutely no significant differences in the mental well-being of children raised in same-sex environments than those raised by heterosexual couples. if you believe a few stories from a non-representative sample (such as at a school event) that is not sound evidence for showing that being raised by a same-sex couple ""leads to childhood depression"" (paraphrase of you, of course). this simply isn't true. what unbiased RESEARCH have you read. the government is not very willing to support this research because it will prove their legislation immoral up to this point because it discriminates against people off of unfounded stereotypes. if you look up a list of organizations (yes, some actually government funded), you will discover that every major national (secular) organization that has mental well-being AND child welfare in mind support both same-sex marriage and adoption. 

3) many individuals who grow up in ""natural"" (not ""DIFFERENT"" as you call them) households have absolutely no choice what family they're born into. in fact, every single biologically conceived child has no choice what family they are born in to. there is a much higher rate of familial conflict in families that are headed by heterosexual couples. because of the high cost, time, and effort that a same-sex couple has to go through to adopt, they have such a huge desire to raise a child, meaning they are much less likely to be abusive towards a child. child-abuse rates are exponentially higher for a child of a different-sex couple. similarly, your labels of ""mother"" and ""father"" are ludicrous. what about children raised by single parents? what about children raised by grandparents? what about children raised by an aunt and uncle? what about a child raised by a mother and an aunt? what about a child raised by a mother and a grandmother? etc. i could go on. it's not about the traditional nuclear family. that is a modern western ideal, and not in the majority around the world. it truly does take a village to raise a child, and it has a lot more to do with the fact that a child has individuals who love and care of him/her, rather than this ideal of the nuclear family with mom, dad and 2.5 kids. what about children adopted by different-sex couples? do they not have to accept their parents because a) they're not biological and b) they haven't ""earned"" it yet? trust me, if it were left up to ""earning"" parenthood, same-sex couples would most certainly accel at that. 

4) we have freedom of religion in america. ironically, even those many churches and denominations reject gays and lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders, there ARE accepting denominations and many in the LGBT community seek out those accepting communities. and because of said freedom of religion, there is the freedom to NOT ascribe to a religion. you have no evidence to claim ""people base their religion off their beliefs"" because many people who have anti-gay thougths have them because they have always had an oppressive form of religion in their lives. you cannot go back to day 1 and perforam an experiment to see if those ideals would've come about or not. my guess is that they wouldn't have turned out so homophobic unless they'd had it rammed down their throats every day. people have to be taught to hate. that's a psychological fact. 

you've got tons of information. too bad it's all MISinformation and generalizations that you've made based off a small sample of individuals. how many people were on that panel? were they all native minnesotans? even if you have gathered your info from elsewhere, it's no good. why would people fighting for equality spout out misinformation, especially when there are people out there looking to discredit everything we say? people fighting for basic human rights have to research this topic above and beyond what anyone in your position would ever have to do just to be able to write your pretentious little misinformed conservative blog.

"event","just about everyone who has an anti-gay group on facebook is personally an asshole. i tried to give them the benefit of the doubt by approaching them respectfully, even the groups that say ""liberalism is gay"" and stuff like that. i wanted to see what they had to say, just to see whether or not my prejudices had any justifiable basis. my two favorite responses:

Trey, from Tuscaloosa: gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay gay

Jessie: thats great that you feel like that but I can say whatever I want...sorry to offend you but I use these words all the time in my humor...I do not agree with the homosexual society and do make fun of it daily

wow. look at those winners. it really doesn't make me angry. it makes me sad that these young men have decided to close themselves off to so many wonderful people. it makes me sad that they are so insecure in their own masculinities that they have to constantly reassert it by being anti-gay. it makes me sad to think that they are representative of an american disease of fear, fear of that which is different, fear of the unknown, fear fear fear fear fear. that's how we get people to vote. ""vote for us, or this will happen!"", ""no, vote for US or THIS will happen!!!"". what about ""why don't you vote for me, and these are the positive changes i'll make"". and it's the same for both parties. i don't know about this whole ""fear"" bit politicians are trying to pull. appealing to such a negative emotion creates a society that has negative views about so many different groups of people and ideas.

"event","so long-story-short is that i've been working out a lot at the gym here at usc and they have individual tv screens for each eliptical machine, so i've been catching up on my cnn. and it makes me angry. 

rant #1: even though this isn't directly linked to cnn, my feminist awareness causes me to become much more easily angered by sexist-patriarchal commercials. advertisements have found new and improved ways (!) to subliminally undermine the values of feminism, and relationally, the value of being a woman. for example, the vonage wireless phone service company has come out with this new ad campaign. the premise is that you drive by in a van and throw a service package at someone whenever a woman is exhibiting some sort of undesirable behavior. in the first commercial i saw, there was a very heavy set, purposefully very unattractive man who was in the passenger seat of a convertible being driven by a very attractive female. as she drops him off, it is clear that he is breaking up with her. right as she starts to get upset and ask questions, a vonage van rolls by and saves this man's day! no, he doesn't have to explain his feelings and give this young woman the justified explanation she deserves because now he has free roaming, long-distance, and minute-expenditure-free nights and weekends! as the girl continues to call out after him, he grabs his vonage package and sprints (as quickly as a large individual can)for his front door. enough said. the second commercial takes place on a beach. a couple is lounging in the sun, when the girl notices dorsal fins floating in the water. music reminiscent of jaws is playing, implying to the viewer that these are the fins of sharks protruding out of the water. the girl ditzily cries out ""oh my gosh! honey, let's go play with the DOLPHINS!"" now, to prevent this poor, helpless female from being eaten alive by killer sharks, a vonage van rolls by once again at the most appropriate moment and saves the day by clobbering the girl over the head and knocking her unconscious for a few moments (because we know that purposely induced unconscious states have been prove to be safe for women. i mean, c'mon, nothing bad has ever happened/been done to any woman who has been volitionally knocked out, no?). she comes to, gets excited about her new service package, throws it to the ground, and starts running out towards the ""dolphins"" again. 

is it so fucking important for the media to make women look like bumbling, worthless, sobbing, nagging, hyper-emotional, irrational idiots? 

rant #2: in southern california, there is legislation under way that is working to create a system that forces landlords to provide citizenship documents for all of its tenants. the idea of this law is to prevent illegal immigration because if they cannot prove their citizenship, they cannot live/move here, so they will have to go back home or be deterred by such strict housing processes. what people DON'T realize is that if this law is enacted, thousands upon thousands of legal-US Born CHILDREN will be kicked out on the streets. yes, i know that they were born here legally because their parents came here illegally, but you have to ignore that for a moment to see the real moral issue. what people want is to take young children and make them part of the growing homeless community in southern california. *surprisingly* most of these people are either mexican or of another latin-american country. if that's not racist, i don't know what is. to take a minority population who is already at a huge disadvantage and to continually shove them back down into poverty and to deprive them of educational opportunities is the most inhumane conclusion to the ""immigration problem.""

rant #3: currently, the congressional investigative commitee that is looking into the illicit correspondences between pages and congressmen has decided that the ""electronic age"" is to blame for these activities. they claim that because they would have such a difficult time monitoring the online activities of pages and congressmen, it would be almost impossible to prevent such occurences from repeating. clearly, the problem-solving strategies have been misdirected towards looking at the safety of the page program. um, last time i checked, these high-school aged individuals weren't seeking out this sexual contact with congressmen. the pathetic, depressed, and repressed old white men seem to be the ones initiating these interactions and behaviors. but no, it's more natural to not place blame where it's rightly due. let's blame the safety of the page program, let's blame alcohol, let's blame our closeted homosexuality, let's blame the internet age. what about former congressmen foley actually being a mature individual and saying ""i fucked up. i shouldn't've been talking to someone who is a minor like that, nor should i have been talking to someone who works under me like that"" (oh doesn't he wish that last one were a double entendre). people just can't own up to stuff anymore. on that same note...

rant #4: house majority leader hastert is being accused of not relaying important information regarding the page-foley situation in a timely manner. a quote from him at a press release yesterday indicated that he is a) not going to take responsibility for anything and b) that he is very slippery with words. he said ""i don't know WHO knew WHAT WHEN"". that leaves so many loopholes for him to get out of trouble. if he knew who and when someone knew something but didn't exactly know what they knew, he's off the hook. if he knew what someone knew and when they knew it, but not exactly who that was, he's off again. and if he knew who it was and what they knew, but exactly when, he gets off again. what a tricky fucking bastard. 

all-in-all: most politicians are scum. and so is the vonage advertisement squad."

"event","so this congressman foley alleges that he was molested by a clergyman when he was in his teens. i'm not saying he's a liar, i'm not saying he's making it up, but the level of scrutiny he's being put under is so minimal in comparison to the level of scrutiny that the majority of women have been put under in similar circumstances. it's as though ""naturally, a male (even though it turns out he's gay!) would not respond in any way to the advances of another male,"" whereas it's interpreted that ""oh come on, what girl wouldn't respond to a man's advanaces. as the conquest housing ads have informed us all, 'you know you want it',"" so i mean, it's right there, plain and simple. i'm not saying that it's ok for people in positions of power to make advances as long as they're welcome, it just seems much more taken for granted in our society that if a man is making allegations of molestation, he is not nearly as doubted as a female in the same position. of course there was a modicum of skepticism, but it was minimal at most. 

bill maher brought up the interesting point that teenagers today aren't so innocent and that these young boys on the other end of the AIM dialogue boxes ""seemed to have more power"" over mark foley than he did over them, as far as the ""sexual relationships"" went (minimal as they may have been, limited only to conversations online, it seems). while it is true that within the limited context of those conversations that the boys had the power to respond to his written sexual advances or to not respond, in the grand scheme of things, the boys had more to lose from not responding than foley did from the boys having a negative response, so taking that into account, innocent or not as the boys may have been, they were still victims of power roles. men who were approached by foley in the past when they were underage say that it was much more professionally advantageous for them to make nice and give in to the congressman's advances for the sake of their careers. 

in other news, new medicines for erectile dysfunction provide a window of opportunity for men of up to 36 hours! sweet shit! unfortunately, one of the side effects may be LOSS OF VISION, which is good for all the women out there in america because instead of having to put up with a day and a half of a potential raging hard-on, you can just edge yourself out from your nearly-blind ""lover"" and instead, slip him into a cozy toy sea cucumber with a drop of lube. he'll never know the difference, and you'll be sitting back on the other side of the bed, reading your newly purchased copy of ""the second sex"". yay feminism. boo hegemony."

"event","it is a commonly held belief that women are more ""high-maintenance"" than men are. Woman spend a lot of time doing their hair (these are all stereotypes now, mind you), they spend more time picking out clothes, they care a lot more about how they look, and all that jazz. SO obviously they take more energy to keep pleased and contented no?

for about every hour women spend getting ready everyday, men spend about twice that amount either reasserting their masculinity or defining it for others. How many times a day do you hear your run-of-the-mill hegemonically masculine male say ""dude, that's hella gay, stop that shit"" or ""you little bitch!"" or ""stop being such a pussy!"". straight men exert so much energy exerting heterosexuality that it's no wonder they're so violent and angry all the time. i'd be pretty damn pissed if i had to spend so much time proving my ""manliness"". 

and then you have non-heterosexual men, who not only have to reconstruct yet another type of masculinity, that a) is defiant of hegemonic masculinity and b) has an entire set of rules on its own. gay male culture appears to be outwardly much more unaccepting of ""deviant"" styles of dress or self-expression. it appears to be a modification of traditional hegemonic masculinity in that it is just as strict as far as manner of behavior, speech, dress, and choice of sexual partner. 

i'm not saying ""oh boo-hoo, life is so hard for the boys"" because i feel like a lot of the time, they perpetuate their own problems. i don't blame all men, because of course i'm not stupid enough to make huge generalizations like that, but it's so unfortunate that an entire sex has taken it upon themselves to make themselves and all others miserable. damn. stop being so fucking high-maintenance boys. shit."

mmm. reading about sociolinguistics makes me realize how socially constructed we all are. it's an idea i've fought for a long time, but i've realized that it's ok, because even if we are as much as 75% socially constructed, there's still that 25% that makes us very unique and special. reading about the performative powers of language just makes it very near undeniable that our realities are really just we we constantly reinforce in one another. people say ""sticks and stones can break my bones but words can never hurt me"". what people don't realize is that words have the power to physically harm you as well, either through stereotyping or through creating a negative attitude towards a certain group of people that can lead to social marginalization. but that's a whole issue on its own.

i really don't want everything i say in here to get picked apart, which is why i'm horribly reluctant to have an online journal in the first place. i don't edit this, i don't even go back to read it over before i post it. i wish i had the energy and time to go back and revise things i say, but i have better things to do. i also suppose that it is important to accurately represent myself, but i suppose if someone really knows me and understands me then nothing will be taken to a ridiculous tangent. with that said, i move along...

i had so much trouble coming to terms with social constructions, but when i break it down, it makes a lot of sense. i was born into an intellectual family, so obviously that has a huge bearing on the social environment i grew up in. growing up in fresno also had a huge effect. growing up in the time period we are living in has a huge effect. how society treats gay people has had an effect. but, i do acknowledge that there are certain traits that absolutely cannot be socially constructed. mostly, they are the ideas and actions i have that aren't necessarily socially advantageous. they could be considered socially constructed if i were to do them out of rebellion of a socially constructed norm, but that's not necessarily the case. unfortunately, a lot of these things tend to be my more negative attributes, so i won't go into them too in depth, suffice it to say that my socially unadvantageous, nonrebellious qualities make me unique!!! yay!!! hahaha. i'm ok with that. i mean, my goal in life is not to be unique in the sense that i want to be or do something completely different from any preformed mold, but it's more so to take that mold and paint it gold. oh yeah. that totally rhymed."

"event","...all over the fuckin' place. if you want to post your glamour shots on myspace, great, that's the forum for experimentation with who you are, but facebook (up to this point, and is now pending) has been an academic forum. why would you want to do something so silly as to post half-naked photos of yourself in an supposedly scholastic environment? to me, and to many who i've talked to, it just comes across and inappropriate and out of place. i can't completely explain myself, and some may take that as the illegitimacy of my argument, but facebook to me is more of a lighthearted, fun place, where you can network with friends from schools and keep the sleaze out. but posting these (as i've fondly labelled them) ""glamour shots"" just brings facebook down to the same sleaze-factor level as myspace. and that's why we're fighting the whole ""local area network"" thing that they're trying to put up on facebook. i'm sorry, but i'm a bit of an academic elitist. it's nice to not get offensive messages from people propositioning you for sex. it's nice to actually say i've all of my ""friends"" in person, instead of this weird online ""friendship"" thing. whatever. maybe i'm old-fashioned. maybe i'm more socially aware than some. but w/e. leave the sleaze on myspace."

"event","today i was watching cnn while on the eliptical machine at the gym, and they were addressing the current issue in spain regarding their ban on models that are too skinny in an effort to promote healthier body images by example. a lot of models were turned away at a fashion show in madrid because the government feels that they represented an unhealthy body image that is projected onto young girls. 

then, in an interview with katie couric, first lady laura bush gave her opinions on the matter. this is paraphrased, but the gist of it is the same:

kc: being a mother of two daughters yourself, how do you feel about the spanish government's stance on these unhealthy body images? (obviously prompting a response along the lines of agreement with the spanish government's decision, as evidenced by the part where she says ""being a mother of two daughters yourself"")

lb: well, you don't see OUR government stepping in and regulating on that issue (said in a sarcastic tone, showing her disagreement with the spanish government's decision to ban super-skinny models...and she continues...)but i mean, we ARE tackling the obesity issue...

ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? what a fucking stepford wife. it's ok for little girls to want to be really skinny, but they can't be too fat. what an idiot. she's the antithesis of feminism. i think too many years spent in library bookstacks has caused all the dust to go to her brain. goddam it."

"event","hmmm. i hate having multiple venues of self-expression because then it all gets dispersed and i get frustrated because i can't keep track of all of it. i mean, theoretically, i could print out these entires and past them into my tangible journal, but that's a lot of effort. blah. i'll figure it all out.

so i ordered this mini-moleskine journal that i want to start carrying around with me. i have a lot of epiphanies throughout the day, or research topics, or little witticisms that come to me and i'd like to remember them, but they are so furtive sometimes that i need an immediate way to put them down. so i will carry that little pocket journal in my pocket. that makes enough sense, right? right.

i miss my summer reading. i really enjoy being able to read what interests me. and it's even practical to forming my own research topics/questions, so i should get units for creating my own program of study. i have this idea for an academic program that i eventually want to develop that allows students to create their own route. they would be able to incorporate independent reading/research, extra-curricular involvement, work experience, and classes because i feel like that's the only real way to prepare people for the world. the way college works now, all you learn how to do is go to more school. i want people to have a full experience so that they don't feel so limited to cramming everything in, but that all facets of a collegiate lifestyle are given due empahsis. 

i've also been thinking about socially constructed gender binaries a whole lot. it's funny how some people feel like they're defying them when they're actually just fitting into a stereotype. i see that there are multiple binaries for multiple sexual identities. the gay binary is portrayed as super feminized or as maintaining that hegemonic masculinity (which is often stereotyped as going ""against the mainstream"" of what it is to be gay, but it's just fitting in to the normal stereotypes), and for lesbians, the binary is the butch/femme, with a lot of people feeling that one way is better than the other, when in fact their both nontraditional manifestations of gender portrayals that are simply nontraditional because females are the ones expressing both sides of the binary, but in fact, they're just playing into the overarching hegemonic binaries of masculine/feminine. i wonder what it would be like to truly break those molds. i don't feel like any type of self-expression is better than any other, as long as it is GENUINE. but then again, what is genuine? is it something you don't have to think about or fabricate? i know a lot of people who have made conscious (or unconscious? in which case this whole argument is silliness) efforts to change who they are because of a changed identity, but that doesn't have to be so. being gay doesn't mean dressing in designer clothes and calling everyone ""bitch"". being a lesbian doesn't have to be dressing like a boy (all the time). 

i hate thinking about all of this. there are so many exceptions and qualifications that need to be made that the tangents take away from the original thoughts. 

don't every read my entries. they'll make you hate me."

"event","Rammble one. 
a dying catharsis of awareness
through this revolving funneled chaos 
i am linked with those who have come before me
the palatable waves hit me and i am once again connected by my veins
my sinews, my marrow is heat from me seeping back to the last of my line
passion extending 
like taunt silver threads through the lives of those after me
i see the past which has come to me, this amalgamate of lives, a masterpiece seeking me out

The sanguine embers of my quenching fire will reach out one day, 
reach out and long 
for the taste of things once tasted, the smell of orange peels, 
the sight of an emerald Kentucky hill 
that archetypal division of land and sky. 
Seeking always seeking for the sound of a creek stumbling through the woods in its melodic water song.
and henceforth it will always be seeking, roving,
roving for knowing 
and looking frantically away from the darkness which it may find. 


rammble 2 (an image I cannot shake)
       and there lay my corpse draped upon wet granite
       ethereal mist slithers through the quarry of my demise
       as the virginal cast of morning spreads across the lanscape
       There on these speckled stones my slackened face stares
       it stares with muddied and vacant emeralds,
       as the dew of summers cold clings to my face
       My hand that once rested on a lovers breast, 
       that once traced patterns mindlessly through the scent of oranges
       that once grasped the finger of my mother
       which once touched brush to giving canvas,
       is now crushed and abject, sheathed in the soil
       while in sustained moments of lingering thought, 
       indulged in sentiment
       or in the moments of my ambiguous rites
       how could i not have forseen my end."

Language is symbolic, meaning that it is a made up sound referring to a said object. The only reason this can exist is because there is an understanding between people in a given culture or population that these various syllables correspond to that said item, intangible thought, feeling, ect.ect. Written language requires even more symbolic complexity. Written language is the pictorial description of various syllables, (unless you have a pictorial language like Chinese). In order to read we must first assume that these letters correspond directly to the given sound which they are intended to correlate to. That meaning that we must learn to correlate various phonemes and morphemes with the oral counterparts, such as these words I am typing, You read them, then translate the ""letters"" to the semblance of auditory correlation, You then have to move back to the first symbol layer, that being the correlation of oral language/syllable to concept or representation. To further complicate the issue, even after you has the initial intellectual concept of a said object, the visual representation of that object that is, THEN you move to the spoken representation, and once again move foreword to the written format of the physical spoken language (of which I am typing in now), you then have to take into account various paralinguistic influences, you know, tone, sarcasm, body posture (which is of course exempt in written word lol) But you get my drift? What am I talking about here? Hell if I know. but the more I learn about language, the more socially inept I become. lol. Damn you all!!!!"

"event","Sometimes Days go fine and you think to yourself, ""ah what a great day"".This wasnt. Its all very odd too me. You know how everyone just wants to be happy and so forth? Maybe there really isnt such a thing as reaching that ""Happy"" only momentary happiness, like enjoying the spirit of a song for example. I still dont understand how songs can make you feel really, because feelings are essentially chemical releases in your brain, so that would mean that almost all external stimuli produce chemicals in your brain that effect everything, ethos, pathos, logos. Its all very odd to me. Have you ever thought to yourself that you see clearly for once? Its almost like a a supreme knowledge, like a precience of sorts. I suppose if I were eastern I would call it zen. Moments where everything seems to flow from your being, and everything seems to be at peace. I wish I could have that all the time i suppose. Its an all knowingness, or atleast the feeling that everything will be ok. I generally have the feeling (not thought mind you) that everything is so unstable and any given moment that it will tummble into oblivion. Its good to have those uncommon repreives. Those moments of Clarity. I cant help thinking about it in any other way than a mystic one, but in fact i know in all possibility it is probabaly some chemical reaction in my brain or pre programmed pyschological response. But who cares where the water flows from (on a personal level) as long as it flows? I think I am done questioning."

"event","Ive been thinking a lot about dying lately. Which I suppose is particularly odd for me to think about. But in certain instanced throughout my day I find myself envisioning my own death more and more. If I walk with a cup in my mouth (for instance) I imagine falling on it and the glass shattering into my skull, when I am driving I imaging wrecking and being torn to bits in the wreckage. Its all very odd to me actually. Witnessing my own innumerable deaths. It makes me think of myself as a statistic. I find myself thinking that lives are like snowflakes, forming patterns like those we have all seen before, archetypal and human, all seeming the same, but on closer inspection all unique.
   I suppose without the thought of someone as an individual we see only numbers, a thousand dead, casualties can rise to millions. With individual stories the statistics become people-but even that is a lie really, for these people to continue to suffer in great numbers which is numbing and meaningless. Imagine a child's swollen belly, the flies that crawl in the corner of his eyes, his skeletal limbs, would it make it easier for you to know his name, his age, his hopes, his fears? Would it make it more human to see him from the inside? Even if it would, in doing so aren't we doing a disservice to his sister who lies in the searing dust beside him? She is a distorted caricature of a human child. And if we begin to feel for both of them, are they now more important to us than the thousands of other children with swollen bellies who will soon be food for the flies that will feed their own myriad of squirming children? We all draw lines around these thoughts, and protect these moments of pain in our thoughts with smooth and nacreous layers that let them slip pearlike through our souls without ever causing real pain. But can we afford not to?
   I just find it ultimately frightening that I will once be in this position, a statistic, a thing that died and its flesh is festering, my consciousness gone, my dreams gone, my passions gone, my nuances gone. Everything I have ever loved will be wiped from my memory and will ultimately disappear into oblivion. Its a lot to think about honestly......too much"

"event","Concerning Self Esteem
     by: Brad Twyman
               Our culture teaches us that having high self esteem is better than having low self esteem. Given that self esteem in some nuances is inflicted upon us by chemicals in our brains it is clearly biological. However, Just because something is biological does not necessarily entail that it is an autonomous process. Perception plays a good deal into the role of esteem in ones life I would venture to say Aarron. I would assume, no posthulate that Self Esteem comes from ones Perception of himself or herself in reference to that of here peers, when taken and analyzed this actually throws it into a new light. You have to ask yourself, How do I value myself in reference to the whole of Humanity, Well being that the majority of humanity is undoubtably irestoribly ignorant and unltimately increduously stupid, One who does not fit this stereo type should inherintly have good self esteem to a certain degree. Ultimately ones actions as a human being are left of to their degree of Self Esteem. How much you ""do"" should bear effect in this. However there is the whole ""acceptance"" thing. One cannot ultimately be loney and pulling against the world ( in his own conciousness at least) Acceptence is a social trait that has been ingrained in us for specific biological purposes. And it has good reasons behind it, in former more hostile times, if you are judged amiably by your company, you would be less likely to be raped killed, and so forth (this being before the advent of manditory social structures and the present and former systems of codified rules probably dating before hammurabi) So Self esteem plays an evolutionary role in humanity. One should embrace Evolution for his own sake, Become Machivellian about it even. However if you cannot force yourself into self esteem, or realize good self esteem by judging yourself in reference to your peers and noticing your inherant qualities and disregarding your shortcommingsin some instances (however it would be more beneficial to pledge to work on them) you can always take the lesser alternative. Apathy. Apathy can be a very useful tool and will ultimately lead to good self esteem in some instances. When I say Apathy I dont mean not caring about anything, I mean to say Social Apathy, not caring what one would judge about you. This would work in the present world because of the social system we have constructed. Another thought comes to mind, You have to ask yourself, what have you got to lose? Your dignity? Dignity isnt so high a price if you get the girl sometimes. You are a smart fella Aarron, Im sure you know how to get women, they are like men in many ways, at least intelligent men. lol. I digress........because I have completely forgotten what in the firey hell Im talking about. Bye man. lol"

Because as we all should know as an artist I am in dire peril of pretension. Aside from that forethought how ever, Im taking out my Lebray(sp?) Piercing. I was speaking with someone about the valley station little league team (where I live lol) winning the Little League world Series (comedy of all comedies) and I decided it would be funny to startle her by saying something loudly in here ear (being the demented sadist that I am). Well, I was welcomed with a back-fist to the chin after that whole endeavor and I proceeded to curse my way into the bathroom where I looked at my poor chipped tooth and receded gum. So Ive said today, to hell with Cultural decoration. Its a nuisance. Damn it all."

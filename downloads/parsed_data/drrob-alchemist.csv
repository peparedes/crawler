People do not understand love.
To let them go some one said....
Thats kindness not love
Thats fear of rejection not love
Fear of hurting  thats not love.
Love what is it anyway ...
Just a word to many
The meaning of life to others.

Glad i woke a few people up.
Glad the fears come and go.
Glad that people think love is some thing to be treasured.

Funny how what we see can bring out a great many emotions.
Dumb Arse um yes probably, but human with all the failings of humanity.
Nott trying to cover them up or explain them....
You cant.

Treasure it

"event","Well im a granddad again.
Feel older than i did last week.

Well haveing said im back dont know what to write.
I know what i would like to write but what ever.

Things is sort of funny at the moment,remebering things that i cant really remember its like they happened to some one else not to me or else i would remember them.
Perhaps i am some one else pretending to be me.
Perhps im not really here but a figment of that universal ants imagination.

( please no one step on the ant or we all disapear)
If music be the food of love, I have a lot of neighbours that dont know what love is ,they want me to turn the music down,they will go hungrey.

Also want a new computer the one i have is rubbish now.
It also has a problem spelling,its not me its the computer.
( its you ) ( ok so its me and im getting really crap at spelling)(no change there then) ( thank you ) ( your welcome)
With every step i take yeh thats right but what ever.( got this thing about a tune that means lots of things at lots of time and coupled with another tune is well sort of really weird ish)
Robyn with every heatbeat and be mine and apocalypotica and myths and legends and the originall music for well know film about a small boy that grows up to be a great magic person and defeats evil. That is full of child abuse and adult dispiseing about children and their feelings and various other stuff what the hell was it called oh yeh Harry Potter.

( no its you that are weird ish) ( yes i know but dont tell everyone)( ok ill keep it a secret) ( thank you ) ( your welcome)
Oh well gotta go and sort of do sort of work sort of.
Thats assuming the assumption that i can assume assumptions ( assuming that the assumption is that i can assume to assume assumptions) ..( what the hell are you on about ) ( i aint got a clue) ( yep thats right)
bye for now everyone
Take care

The funny thing is no one realy missed me when i wasnt( there you go again ) ( yes i know ) ( well stop it ) ( ok)

Anyway im here for a while but then im going again.
going  anyway.
Music ive just started to get into Robyn she sounds great through 8 speakers and through a 150 watt amp.
(yes but the neighbours didnt enjoy it much ) ( oh forgot about that)

Life is funny life is sad but with out life i would not be glad.
( some times)
You know when you get one of those feelongs when you have to write everything down to make sense of everything ( no) ( yes you do ) ( oh forgot,sorry)
when the only way to make sense of things is to read them then cry then read them again then laugh.
Whats the differrence between lahghing and crying ?( None they both make you better )
Why has life delt its cards the way it has ( because it has probably been useing a marked deck)(thats what i thgought)(how many times have i told you not to think)(sorry)(you know it makes you sad) ( and happy)(yes and happy)(Somtimes)
Anyway again where was i oh yes all about nothing realy,the world owes no one a living,yet it can wend its little fingers around some one and effect them for the rest of their lives.
It can build some one up then destroy them. Destroy them when they are built up.
We blame everyone and everything rather than life and how we have played it.
The reality is that some one once said....
""Hell is other people""
Without them our wishes would never be filled and our pains when they get shatered not be there,the lesson not learnt.
(what the hell are you on about)(damned if i know)(neither do i)
Oh well enough ramblings.
With every heatbeat Robyn on very loud again and some of her others that will do.
What is this life but full of care,.......Its Life ( but not as we know it Jim)(who the hell is jim)(star trek?)(oh)
Bye for now more ramblings later.
Take care everyone.

What a lot happens when your not here when life is on hold and everything is uncertain.

When everything you want to do you think perhaps not.

Lofe is a strang thing a strange journey that everyone takes and everyone feels so so differently.
A journey of wants needs hopes and desires and fears for the future and fears from the past,that altimately effect the now and the future.

When we think we have all that we desire, life in her wisdom says no you start again see if you have learnt the lesson i gave.

We dont learn we get drawn into the confort of love and desire forgeting all that has gone before.

oh well!!!
What ever
Take care everyone
Well try to write something that comes close to sense soon"

That you perceive;
The Webb they weave ;
So keep on thinking free.

22,000 days,22,000 Nights.

That which we are we are,
That which we become we can choose.
That which happens to us we have no control.
Grasp the future firmly in an embrace, with your back up against the past.

That which is , that which i have i have, that i can not change.
The dawning of the morrow is that which is.
The light of the darkness in my head.
The feelings and emotions I have had.
They really are not all that bad.
They made me human gave me love.
That which is, that is love.

If no truths are spoken no lies can hide, no love can come into the world.
No love, no hate, no tears, no time to be human and be as we were.
If we are not human then what are we.
Lies are but truths in an individual form ,truths are perceptions of individual reality love is real and there in all forms ,including the lies and deceit over time, reality is nothing but lies and  individual truths,to make us feel good.

Ok so i still cant do poetry.
and
I still have no coffee going to get some now.

I am, therefore I am ,I think ?

I'm more than that? i mean, I think, I must be?
I think,therefor I am ,I think.?


The Angel of time. ( with apologies to Rick Wake man and H.G.Wells. and real poets)


The Angel of time is calling.
The time of our birth and our death.
When time is the limit of everything.
The meaning of all our  very breath.

The angel of time can call us.
Whenever and wherever she will.
She shows herself very rarely.
When she does we must bow to her will.

All I ask for her to wait .
To give me a little more time.
Time Till I have had a few more kisses, more time to be mine.
More time to love, more time to be, more to be me.
Grab each day and hold on to its good and bad bits,It will not come round again.Love when you can,protect that love.Do not throw it away when it truely arrives.

That actualy made sense ,I must be loosing it.(You lost it,lost it all months ago )(ok i know)

Well im here ,( sort of ) ( what ever)

I wish everyone all that they wish for.
For me well read the above again.
Ok wheres the damn coffee i need one a strong one.
Most important date in my life now is 20/9/2006.
Ok would have loved a coffee but havent got any .
Havent got a lot of anything now.

Oh well have to go buy cheap crappy coffee i supose.
Rather put me head in a bucket and scream ( oh that would hurt)but thats better than no coffee at all i suposee.( um so a poke in the eye with a pointed stick is better than no poke in the eye with a pointed stick.)Must give it some thought.

Oh well bye for now head aches ,brain aches ( ears would ache if i had put me head in a bucket and screamed)"

_The Secret  Life of Elizabeth I_ 

(http://www.five.tv/programmes/revealed/secretelizabeth/) 

Wednesday 14th June 2006, 8.00pm 
Elizabeth I is a great icon of history, popularised as the unmarried,  childless queen who saved her nation. For centuries, historians have documented  the Famed love affair between Elizabeth I and Robert Dudley. We explore the truth behind the claims of Arthur Dudley, the self confessed child of the Virgin Queen

This is the filming that has Kentwell and participants in.

"event","Ok... so here are some random college updates:

* Field Hockey looks like it's gonna be good  (Hell, Farmer isn't my coach anymore!!!)
* The boys are ok... nothing special haha! jk! There are tons of hotties, but a lot of jackasses too :/
* Classes are better now that I fixed my schedule... I am out by at least 2 every day :)
* I think I was placed in the wrong dorm, I want to live with Sammy ;)
* Last nite some really weird kids streaked in front of Riley... and for the most part were sober!  WHAT IS THAT?!?!

Oh well! College rocks! Can't believe I had to wait 18 years for this! 

I miss all my Keene people, but rest easy knowing you all are having a wonderful time at school too!!  (Not missing KHS however)"

"event","Well all I can say is that this was the BEST Friday the 13th ever!!!  

I essentially did nothing all day, and then tonite I went Galactic Bowling with Julie, Alli, my friend Dave from WPI, and Dave's friend Tom.  It was a blast!  It was awesome to see Dave again, and Tom was a blast as well.  (And surprisingly the name didn't do anything to me!! There is a God after all!)

But all-in-all I had an AWESOME night and can't wait to hang out with some of these people again!! ;)"

After that it's the usual hanging out with the family and dinner @ Nicola's.  Then it's time to pack for my CRUISE!  Mommy and I are going on a cruise to COZUMEL!

"event","OOOK... Here's a run down of everything I have done in the last week!

Saturday the 17th was Bay States.  That was awesome!  I got to play a lot of field hockey and hang out with the coolest team ever (sorry, but KHS doesn't compare).  After playing we went to Whit's house and swam and ate, which also rocked! haha.

Sunday I worked... b/c that's what I do, I am officially Hannaford's bitch :(

Monday through Thursday I worked and drove to WPI every afternoon to coach at camp.  All I can say is that those were four of the greatest days of the entire summer.  There were a lot of really cute girls who were so eager to learn about field hockey and it was adorable!  Plus, I got to hang out with JRoy (the weeble), Whit (who will shoot you with her field hockey stick if she gets angry), Lynn (is crazy... like me), Nowill and Jenelle (who are fun to horse around with).  

Friday I worked and then drove down to CT to hang out with Tom and go to a party his grandparents were having on Saturday.  All was going well till I got onto I-91 and my car started saying it was over-heating!  So I called Mom and Dad to see what I should do and they told me to start heading home so I could trade cars and take the good ol' minivan.  Finally after driving back to Chesterfield hill, I got the new car and headed off to CT again.  Saturday was the party and all I can say is his family is a lot of fun!  His uncle Patrick brought a potato cannon to the party and they were shooting potato's all over the place (which thankfully I brought my camera to record some footage of).  We got back to his house around 11 and around 11:45 I proceeded to drive home.  AND to add to all this, my cell battery was completely dead, so I got about 20 minutes out of South Windsor, realized my cell was dead, and pulled into a gas station to use a pay-phone to call my parents.  When I finally get through to them I realized that they have called my friends trying to find out if they have heard from me, thinking I was dead.  So now all my friends think I am dead, my parents WERE thinking I was dead, and there was much chaos on my behalf.  <b>OOPS!!!</b> Then around 1:15 I reached Keene, drove to Alli's where I had been planning on sleeping over, where I was greeted by Em almost killing me for making her think I was dead.  I finally got home, plugged in the cell and found I had <b>NINE</b> VOICEMAILS and one text message, all of which were people wondering where I was.  Did I mention <b>OOPS!!!</b>?

Now it's Sunday, I've grocery shopped and have NO intention of driving anywhere more than 20 minutes MAX from my house.  I am SICK of driving (regardless of the fact that I did it voluntarily all week...)"

<h2>Leo - Your Love Profile</h2>
<b>Your positive traits:</b>
<br><br>
You're almost always the center of attention - and easy for potential dates to spot<br>
Your happiness and optimism is appealing to all... and contagious!<br>
You don't hold grudges - getting over little fights is no problem for you
<br><br>
<b>Your negative traits:</b>
<br><br>
You tend to ignore relationship problems, until they are too big to handle<br>
You crave luxury, and you are disappointed with partners who can't provide you with it<br>
If someone does you wrong, you'll coldly and cruely break their heart
<br><br>
<b>Your ideal partner:</b>
<br><br>
Someone high status enough to bring you more attention - but not so great that they upstage you<br>
Makes you laugh and brings excitement to everything you do together<br>
Is aggressive and confident enough to butt heads with you every so often
<br><br>
<b>Your dating style:</b>
<br><br>
High expectations. You need to be impressed with an incredible first date for a second one to occur.
<br><br>
<b>Your seduction style:</b>
<br><br>
You like to make the first move - you're fearless about initiating things<br>
Passionate. You really get into any intimate act.<br>
Aggressive. Most of the time, you find yourself wanting sex more than your partner.
<br><br>
<b>Tips for the future:</b>
<br><br>
Try to not need so much attention. You'll feel less ignored, guaranteed.<br>
Learn to love your parnter for who they are - not how they help advance your life.<br>
Let your partner shine occasionally. You don't always have to be the alpha dog.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>Best day for a date:</b> Sunday

"event","ME! haha!  I really haven't updated in forever and I am sorry if it offended all 4 of you who actually try to read this on a regular basis!



<b>The most important things that have happened since I last updated:</b>
  
  Got to help out ""coaching"" at a field hockey camp at WPI.

  Went to Rhode Island and in the process saw Ryan Graves, Alethia G., and Caitlin Dowley.

  I got my ears peirced... second holes and the cartilage of my left ear.

  On the 4th of July Em Harris, who happened to be in RI at the time, stopped by in Bristol at my grandmother's house and stayed the night.  We then got to go out and guard the chairs* on the parade route with my dad and cousin John at 5:30 AM.  On the plus side I got to drive John's new Accura to Sip and Dip to get donuts!



* You all have to understand this one thing about the 4th in Bristol... they take this holiday VERY serious!  They have the oldest parade in the country.  The parade route, instead of having yellow lines painted down the middle of the road, YEAR-ROUND they have red, white, and blue stripes.  The deal with the hardcore parade lovers is that you can legally go out and set up chairs along the parade route at 2AM for a parade that doesn't start until 10:30AM.  THIS is how important this one parade is... it also doesn't help that my grandmother is OBSESSED with the 4th... she waits all year for it and gets all geared up starting late June, singing random patriotic songs and wearing red, white, and blue.  (Good thing she is by far the greatest grandmother ever!!)  I wish I was pulling all your legs about this whole deal, but I'm not.




p.s. I miss all the people who have recently left me! Jules and Alli in England... Julie O @ camp in NY... Kol in the Cape (though I think she is returning soon)... J2 in New Jersey with her horsies... TOM in St. Thomas (coming home tomorrow!!! :D)... and I am sure there are more people who are gone, but didn't feel the need to tell me they left, so I don't miss them too much hehe!"

Project Grad was amazingly fun!  It was awesome to hang out with some of the most fun people I've ever known!  I hope we all get together this summer and do WILD and CRAZY things!

You all have touched my life in some special way at one point or another, I can't thank you enough for that!  You have made me who I am today!  You all mean the world to me, and it breaks my heart to have to say goodbye to any of you!  Never lose touch!"

"event","Ok I already typed this up, then the window crashed and deleted EVERYTHING!  I know I've been slacking in the LJ department, and if that offends you I am deeply sorry!

Wednesday:
School, then our match was ""rained out"" and we had to go to practice indoors, which sucked!  Judy made Urey and I drive all the way out to the indoor courts and essentially warm up to then tell us that she wouldn't need us there and send us home... ALL FOR NOTHING!  I mean honestly, it was such a waste of gas, WHICH ISN'T GETTING CHEAPER JUDY!

Thursday:
School, followed by me heading out to the college to be in the IT department's new film for incoming freshmen.  I get to be a girl whose computer gets a virus and has to go to the HelpDesk to get it fixed, I felt like I was in a cheesy ad, but w/e it will be amusing to see the end result.  Then we had our tennis match that was postponed the day before @ the college.  We played/destroyed Concord and won 9-0!  Sarah, from my french class, came to visit me at the match.  That was fun!  I haven't seen her in a long time.  She's a lot of fun!  The boys ended up winning their match too, I think their score was 7-2, but I wouldn't quote me on it.

Friday:
SENIOR SKIP DAY!!  And wait, I was in school b/c we had a damned tennis match in BG!  That was pretty harsh!  We tragically ended up losing 3-6.  All-in-all I am very proud of the team for our season!  I am particularly proud of Kolene, Kathleen, and the team of Ashley and Jackie on their wins!  You gals did awesome!  The tragedy came when Cali had to go to a tie break in singles, and again the Bowman/McDade team's loss in doubles.  The bus ride home was fun though, regardless of the fact it was a yellow-belly it was a good time!  We had stories, demonstrations, and tons of laughing!  I miss you girls so much already!  We need to have that sleepover soon!

Saturday:
Worked 8 - 1:30, then the boy came up to hang out!!  It sucks royally that I only get to see him once a week, but it's almost the summer... so that will be fine!  We always have so much fun hanging out, I'm never in a bad mood talking to him.  There's just something about him that makes everything better!  HOLY CRAP!  I just realized that I am slowly becoming one of those girlfriends I always make fun of, you know... the ones who talk about her boyfriend WAY too much.  DAMNIT!  Oh well... moving on.  Then we went with Kerri, Ashley W, and Nicole to see ""We Still Believe"", the Red Sox movie.  That was good, even though I know they lose in the end, I just couldn't help but get caught up in all the excitement!  After the movie we went to the Piazza and visited Kolene @ work, and happened to run into Cali and Ryan!  I know everyone has said it already, but they are cute!  They make a good couple!

Sunday:
Worked 3-7.  After that I went to the Northfield Drive-In with Julie, Nate, and Nate's friend Kyle.  Now I've met Kyle twice, the first time I was kinda drunk, and then Sunday night, when I was REALLY over-tired, which is equivalent to me being drunk.  So now he must REALLY think I'm weird, like you all already know!  Anyway... back to the drive-in, we saw Shrek 2 (which was cute and funny!) and 50 First Dates (which was also funny).  On the way home Nate had WKNE on the radio, and Julie and I just busted out all the songs!  It was so funny, I thought I was going to die laughing!  Then I came home and passed out... HARD!

Monday:
Washed my car and mommy's car, then hung out w/ Kerri.  We did our usual visit to the Piazza followed by a walk around downtown Keene.  (On a totally random side note, I really like Keene's downtown, not many cities have downtowns like ours anymore... it's sad!)  Then Kerri and I drove around and made a lil stop.  I had fun, but I embarrassed Kerri somehow, so now she's mad at me!  HOW can someone be mad at me?!?!  I'm so damn lovable!  Hahaha!

WOW! That is a lil synopsis of what I have been up to as of late!  Leave me a post plz b/c I just love getting them!!!"

All I can say about the Loomis Prom is WOHOO!  I had such a good time!  I'm so glad I got to meet everyone, but most of all glad I got to see the boy :)!

Pre-Prom was fun, I got a mini-tour of the LC campus.  It was amazing to see people walking around in their prom clothes @ like 5 when prom didn't start till 8:30(ish).  I also got to see the video of the ""Senior Project"" I really can't wait to see how that turns out.  Just in case I haven't told anyone about that I will brag a little more about their geniosity... Tom, ARP, and Zach are taking a Chevy Nova, ripping it apart, and making it totally remote control.  How cool does that sound??

The dance was ok, I had so much fun meeting everyone.  No one is half as bad as Tom described them... I mean Morgan doesn't drool all over himself, ARP isn't a schizo, and Zach doesn't sound like a smurf 24/7! (haha jk!! that was never REALLY said!) I also got to meet Jenn, (no I'm not going crazy, there is another Jenn!) and she was really nice!

Ok, I just have to get this out, the Cosmo girl in me is making me do this... I really liked all the dresses the Loomis girls had, and what was even more weird was the fact that I had never seen them before! (thanks for listening)

The best way to describe the post-prom happening is hilarious!  It was pretty high-energy, which was amusing considering everyone was dead.  This is just a reference so Keene people can get a picture, but it was a lot like Project Grad. with stuff all over the place etc. When they finally released us @ 5 AM, Tom and I went back to his house and passed out.  And somewhere along the line there was some random phone call that woke us up @ 6 (haha busted!).  Slept till about 10:30/11 (I think), had some breakfast, hung out for a bit and then went home around 1.

Now I am going to head off to bed b/c I am currently running on around 5 hours of sleep for the last 48 hours and it isn't really working.  Leave a post... I just LOVE getting them!"

"event","OK, so here's the low-down on KHS Prom 2004... (I know, you've been dying to know)

Pre-prom:
Did the hair etc. in the AM, then waited around the house for Tom, freaking out that I was going to forget something important.  After he got here we went to Alli R's to get ready and what-not.  Alli, Em, Laura, Jess, Margaret, and Lindsay were there hanging out doing the traditional pre-prom bit.  It rained, and that sucked but by the time we left Alli's it had stopped and was starting to dry a little.  Then we went to Ashuelot River Park and took pictures with Kerri, Nate, Kolene, Sam, Emily A, Corey, Julie, and Garrett.  Then it was off to Hidden Hills for Prom.

Prom:
One word... INCREDIBLE!  Even though it rained and my dress was SOAKED for a little bit, it didn't even FACTOR into the night as a whole!  Dinner was so much fun, hanging out with some of my best friends, just having a good time!  Then the music came on and tables were cleared and people started dancing.  The best part of dancing was that I finally got the boy to dance (and he isn't even a bad dancer like most first-timers!!)!  I got to dance with a couple other friends too, which was nice.  And all I can say is that all my friends and their dates were SOOOO cute... especially a certain C and R couple (*wink wink wink* hehe, if you don't know who that is don't bother asking... too complicated)!  Seeing everyone all dressed up was awesome! It's amazing the difference in guys when they're not wearing for example all volleyball clothes or sweatshirts or pants down to their knees.  I was pretty happy with Prom king and queen, Rob Arbogast and Laura Dale.  I think Nick would have been a good prom king too, but Arbo works as well.

Post-Prom:
Hanging out at my house... I mean Julie's house, haha, was great.  There was originally was about 14 people there hanging out, but then Julie, Garrett, Alli C, Em, Jacob, Tom, and I ended up being the only ones to stay over.  That made things interesting, not in a bad way though... Julie, Em, and I would all beat up on our bf's and then they'd take shots at us, and it was really fun. We all just hung out and then passed out.  All I have to say is be careful where you look first thing when you wake up... make sure it's not at your best friend making out with her boyfriend b/c that will scar you for life!

To everyone who went to Prom and made it such an amazing night, THANK YOU!  And to everyone else who didn't want to or couldn't go to Prom, just know @ some point I probably thought of you and missed you dearly!

This weekend (5/22) is Tom's Prom down in CT.  Can't wait to FINALLY meet his friends considering he's met mine THREE times already!"

Also, the tennis team looked very sexalicious in our Sadies dresses, it was worth all the dress code violations ladies!  I can't help it... I just LOVE that dress!!!  We won our match today 9-0! STATE CHAMPS LADIES I FEEL IT COMING!

All I can say is WOW!  It really got to me when I saw one of my best friends sitting in a car screaming like she was in great pain al because Tyler decided to ""drink and drive"".  What was worse was the fact I was sitting near some jackasses who thought it was all a joke and was so funny, but it isn't it's reality!!!  All I can say is that if anyone of my friends decides to be an ass and drink and drive and cause an accident and don't die... I will kill you!  

Then after 3rd block I went and got a haircut and decided on a hairdo for prom that is totally hott!  Loosely pulled back and in an semi-french twist with curls.  

Then after much searching for an MIA Laura I decided to head down to Baldwinville MA to watch a little baseball.  It was a good game with a few nice home runs ;) and I finally got to meet Ryan (which was nice!).

And soon I am off to watch some FRIENDS and do a little chatting with the previously MIA Laura. hehe! Leave a post!

All I can say is that now AP's are over I have no intention of really trying in school, and just want Prom, Salmagundi, Senior Skip Day, and Graduation to all happen in the next week! Speaking of senior skip day... what are people doing? I really wanna do something fun!

Yeah, so life is kinda hectic.  Prom seems SO FAR AWAY, but it's going to rock!  

Gettin the boot... I'll write more later!"

I also want to take a second and thank all my girls for putting up with me over these last few weeks of ""interesting"" times.  You gals are everything a girl could hope for!

Nostalgia was AMAZING!  All the work you guys put into it definately showed, my fav's were PJ, Tara, Eric, Jiggy, and the boys.

Well I don't want to get all sappy, so next subject... AP's (again).  English wasn't as bad as I expected, but I obviously didn't enjoy it.  Physics is going to be a little harder than expected, but I think that if I get some decent studying/review done today I will be able to do well.  As for psych, I think I am going to OWN that test!  But I guess we'll see how it all really went down in late July (what a great birthday present, NOT).

Aaaaanyway, it's late/early and I'm tired as hell!  I'll see y'all around later!"

I asked if you wanted to be with me forever, you said no.
I asked if I walked away would you cry, you said no, I told you I couldn't bear this hurt anymore and started to walk away... 
You grabbed my arm and said
You're not pretty, you're beautiful,
I don't want to be with you forever, I need to be with you forever, and if you walked away I wouldn't cry, I'd die...

I get the best feeling in the world when you say hi or smile at me, because I know that even for a second that I've crossed your mind.

You helped me laugh, you dried my tears, because of you, I have no fears, together we live, together we grow, teaching each other what we must know, you came in my life, and I was blessed I love you girl, you are the best, release my hand, and say good-bye please my friend don't you cry, I promise you this, it's not the end 'cause like I said you're my best friend .

Wait for the boy who pursues you, the one who will make an ordinary day seem magical; the kind of boy who brings out the best in you, and makes you want to be a better person.  Wait for the boy who will be your best friend, the person who will drop everything at any time of the day.  Wait for the boy who makes you smile like no other boy does, and when he smiles, you know he needs you.  Wait for the boy who wants to show you off to the world when you're in sweats and have no makeup on.  Most of all, wait for the boy who will put you at the center of his universe because you're the center of yours."

My other recent occupations include:
 *Matchmaker of the inevitable for the retarded
 *Mother
 *""Sex Kitten"" (HAHA)
 *Jokester

I recently won the ""Most Likely To Fall For A Joke You Pulled On Your Best Friend The Night Before"" Award!  To make a long story short... Tom and I played a joke on Jules in which we told her a whole bunch of ""interesting"" stories about us that never really happened and thus made her TWEAK!  The next night Tom and his friend Adam (aka Arp) pull the EXACT same thing on me! (I just LOVE meeting/talking to new people :-P)

Saturday was freaking awesome!  I got up, went to work, visited Julie at work, and then came home.  And then Julie and I hung out from 3-12ish and in that time managed to go to a lax game, attend church [like good lil' Catholic girls do O:)], make pizza, get a lil' tipsy, take online quizzes, dance around like tools, and watch ""Not Another Teen Movie"" with Cali and Alli.  It was a ""Girls Day Out"" and I LOVED it!

Today I get to go to work and then hang out w/ my tennis girlies for a team dinner @ Jackies! Geez, I luv (most of) these girls... but never forget the original crew (Forbiden Fruit, Sponge, Hippie, ""Like a Gazelle"" McD, Poofie, and Twig).

I know I bitched about this last time... but I'm REALLY not looking forward to AP tests!  At least I get English over and done with first!

This one's for Kerri, but I'm so upset I have to miss AstroBlast on the 22nd!  Let me show you how upset I am... wait for it... wait for it... nope can't do it! hahaha

Yeah so my mommy and I decided that we want to go on a cruise for our mother-daughter excursion.  We think we're gonna go in early July, which means no NJ, oh well.

Ok, this is my advice for the day: Do not snort coke... you'll get the ice cubes stuck in your nose!"

My newest name on the tennis team is ""Flocker"". If you want that story you're going to have to suck it up and ask me!

Speaking of tennis, why is it that the NHIAA schedules matches so that boys and girls never get to watch each other play?  It bites, I mean we have friends on the team and we want to support them!  Oh well!

Moving on... COLLEGE! I CAN'T F'ING wait! 111 DAYS TILL I GO TO WPI just in case you're wondering ;)!  Next year is gonna be WICKED awesome!  Class of 2008 will ROCK, there are so many cool people coming next year (and some not so cool... haha JK bud)!

What to talk about next??? Oh I know... AP TESTING!  Let's bitch about that!  AP English is gonna suck hardcore!  I hate english and have no desire what-so-ever to pursue a career in that field.  AP Physics is gonna be a pain b/c it's on a Monday and I KNOW none of the guys are going to want to do any form of studying Sunday night, so I'm alone in that one.  AP Psychology is gonna be a WHOLE lot easier, I'm not really worried about that one, if I do well ""great,"" if not ""oh well"".  I feel really prepared though, that class and the people in it were AMAZING!

While watching FRIENDS tonite I realized how hard it is going to be to say goodbye!  I love you all and will miss you something fierce!  But we still have 6 weeks of school and @ least 2 months of summer!

So my life has gotten very interesting as of late... I'm sure you ALL know the story by now.  

I just have to say that I love talking, but lately I've noticed there are other people who like to ramble more than I do... I know some of you won't believe it, but others of you KNOW it!  

I can't WAIT for prom... 19 days! This is gonna be the greatest!

College is coming up fast too!!! Unlike some people *cough Ryan cough* I don't get to go on August 13th, I have to wait till the 18th with the rest of the field hockey girls... but w/e it's still sooner than the rest of the freshmen who go on August 21st.  Have I mentioned lately that I REALLY can't wait for college??

And I just want to give a little shoutout to all my bestest friends... especially 2 of my main chica's... Kolene and Julie, I love you gals and I can't imagine what next year will be like without you girls!"

Saw Kill Bill 2, and it was ok.  I mean I didn't come out of the theater wanting to shoot myself... then again I don't really feel the need to see it again anytime soon.  So w/e, I'm kinda impartial.

Today I headed down south to RI to celebrate my aunt's 40th birthday.  It was cool to see my mom's 1/2 of the family, I haven't seen them in a long time, so that was nice.  My cousin who is... 25/26ish... lives in the Boston area and can't wait for me to go to WPI so I can go to Boston and party w/ her! wohoo!

Wednesday we lost to BG 8-1, but as #4 I lost 8-5 (which I am very proud of btw).  

Thursday I hung out w/ Jason and watched Kill Bill 1, which was pretty bad.  Then I hung out w/ Alli and went to Athens, which was her first time going TO Athens... WEIRDO! haha jk girl!

Today I went w/ my dad to WPI! I got to talk to the field hockey coach and it ROCKED!  She is really nice and she's wicked excited about next year! Apparently she recruited 8 other freshmen, including myself... so that will be fun.  Also the team is apparently one big happy family, most girls live together... which is GREAT compared to this year's team! Did I mention that I REALLY can't wait to go to college??? Less than 4 months BABY!

Ok so Sunday was fairly uneventful... I hung around the house all day and went out to dinner w/ Jules and Alli.  Then we went back to Julie's and watched VH1's DIVAS, which was interesting.

Sunday afternoon, however, we got a call saying that my 8 yr. old cousin Kenzie had fallen off the trampoline and broken her arm, and that she was going to need surgery.  So my sister and I were asked to come down and hang out with the rest of the cousins Monday and Tuesday while Kenz went into surgery.  

So we went down to Bristol RI Mon. and Tues. I also got to do a little shopping @ PPM.  I was so proud of my shopping skillz... I got a shirt, hat, 2 pairs of flip-flops, a car jar, and prom jewelry.

Regardless of the fact he is an ass, I WANT Vlad, I mean did you SEE him??  We didn't get as much time shopping as we wanted to, but we did get to walk around NYC for a while, which was fun.  

Thoroughly Modern Millie was awesome! I had no idea Dixie Carter was Mrs. Meers! (Just in case the name doesn't ring a bell, she's Julia Sugarbaker from Lifetime's show Designing Women.)  The singing was incredible as well as the dancing and acting. I'm so glad I got to see this show, I love the 20's!

Dinner was fun too.  We went to Ellen's Stardust Cafe where the waiters and waitresses sing.  Everyone busted out ""Hopelessly Devoted To You"" and ""Proud Mary""!  And Tyler was being hit on by one of the waitresses, which was hysterical!  

The post-dinner shopping was alright, I was a total tourist and bought an I(heart)NY T-shirt.  Then we stopped in @ Starbucks while waiting for Eric and Tyler in GAP.  After that we hung out around the park waiting for the bus, took some pictures, chatted, and so on.  The bus came, we all packed on and played a little T or D, which I am still scarred from (Jules WHY did you have to say yes?!?!? That was just too weird!).  Then we watched ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and I fell asleep.

So all-in-all I had fun! It was a great way to start off April vacation! Love you all!!"

"event","Well, this was an excellent running week. I was able to handle a pretty significant increase in mileage with no injuries or great fatigue. I also accomplished a mini-goal of mine, which was to run a farther distance than I ever had before. 12 miles felt exhausting, but a lot of that was due to mental hurdles; now that I'm more confident about my body's ability to run distances that long, those mental blocks won't be a problem.

I was also able to negotiate two Thanksgiving dinners without overeating or really eating anything unhealthy (outside of a tiny bit of ice cream in a moment of weakness). That helped my long run enormously, and is a good sign for when I'll have to regulate my diet more intensely. 

All in all, a huge week for me, both physically and mentally. Next week, I'll get up to the milestone of 25 miles total for the week. Can't wait!"

"event","This week I ran 18 miles.

This week was extremely up and down.&nbsp; I started the week with very high energy that lasted for two days straight and petered out as the week went on.&nbsp; My runs were all over the place, some excellent, some horrible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Stepback weeks are both great and hard for me.&nbsp; They're great in that my body gets a rest, but hard in that I always want to make progress.&nbsp; Stepback weeks often come right after a week where my body is feeling strong enough to keep progressing, so it's hard to convince myself to, well, not progress.&nbsp; I had a similar problem when I lifted weights, but that was likely a result of just an athletic routine that wasn't suited for me.&nbsp; This situation, though, seems like smart programming that's hard for me mentally at the moment.&nbsp; Rest is critical to a body's success, and having a week where mileage is reduced is wise; my mind knows that, but my body doesn't. :)

Hopefully, this coming week will be better.&nbsp; It's going to be rough, what with Thanksgiving tempting me to eat way more than I should.&nbsp; I have a huge run for me coming up on Saturday: 12 miles.&nbsp; That'll be the most I'll have ever run at once, which will be thrilling.&nbsp; This week is going to test my stamina, but more importantly, my discipline with both sleep and nutrition.&nbsp; Let's do it!"

"event","This week I ran 21 miles.

This was quite a week. Running went great every day, with my body really feeling strong and very capable of covering the distances. Heck, I was even able to run ten miles and all-out sprint the last mile no problem. I had the requisite aches and pains that come with running, but certainly nothing that prevented me from running all of the distances successfully. 

However, mentally this was the most draining week I've had in a long time. My grandfather had a medical emergency that required a visit to the ER and put me under constant stress all week. Unfortunately, this stress will probably remain for at least another week or two. Thankfully, next week is a stepback week, so I'll be running less overall mileage and will be able to focus on anything unexpected that comes up in regards to my grandfather.

Overall, an excellent week physically and an overwhelming one mentally. The good news is that I'm feeling more confident every week that I can finish the marathon. We'll see how next week goes, but at least in terms of running, everything should go just fine."

"event","This week I ran 23.2 miles (I should have run 19 miles).

What a bizarre week. It didn't seem like a long week, but now that it's Sunday, it feels like the week has gone on forever. My running this week was hampered by me getting a little sick at the beginning of the week and not being able to sleep during the work week (I had insomnia on Monday and never completely recovered from it until Thursday night). I actually felt very strong running all throughout this week, but mentally I was just drained. 

So Monday through Thursday went fine, and then Saturday was about as crazy of a running day as I've had. Read the Saturday post for what happened, but I ended up running a little more than four miles than I should have yesterday for a total of 13.2 miles in one day! That's easily the most mileage I've ever done in one day, and I felt very strong the whole time, both physically and mentally. I'm definitely getting much stronger as a runner, both in pacing myself and my body feeling fit and balanced. Now I just need to get my eating healthier and more regimented.

A rather crazy week, but an overall excellent one. Usually, I do cross-training of some sort on Sundays, like swimming or yoga, but because of my day yesterday, I'm making an executive decision and resting for two days to let my body recover without exertion of any kind. I might go on a longish walk just to stretch out. Phew!"

"event","This week I ran a total of 15 miles.

This was an all over the place week. I had both a perfect run and a terrible run this week, with only a mile difference between them. I introduced weight training back into my fitness regimen, which felt great but was much more taxing than I had anticipated. I'm also still getting used to my new running shoes, which I know will be terrific once I grow into them.

The good thing is that I felt high energy all throughout this week, both at work and during training. This can only be a good sign; my body is not overtaxed and is in fact likely adjusting well to the training. I need to introduce stretching into my day on a daily basis, which I'll try to do next week. 

This was a &quot;stepback&quot; week on the training program, with decreased mileage in order to rest and get ready for the coming weeks. Next week, my long run is going to be nine miles, which sounds somewhat crazy to me, but I know I can do it. Now for a lovely day off tomorrow!"

This is my first post on LJ in 94 weeks, almost two years.&nbsp; I will be running in the Los Angeles Marathon on February 16th, and have been keeping an online training diary of my experience getting ready for it.&nbsp; On LJ, I'll be posting only the weekly recaps.&nbsp; If you want the whole experience, including the recap of Week 1, check out the </em><a href=""http://mikesmarathondiary.blogspot.com/""><em>diary</em></a><em>.&nbsp; Hopefully, you'll enjoy this, and please feel free to leave comments in the diary.&nbsp; Thanks!</em><br /><br /><br /><h3 class=""post-title entry-title""><a href=""http://mikesmarathondiary.blogspot.com/2008/10/week-2-recap.html"">Week 2 Recap</a></h3>   This week I ran a total of 16 miles.<br /><br />A rather eventful week, including injuries that turned out to be no problem once treated, new shoes, discovering the excellence and importance of a headband for my success in running during hot days...<br /><br />Overall, I felt terrific physically this week. My one speed run, which I didn't have to do but wanted to try, was fun and my time was encouraging. My 7 miler on Saturday, while hard at first due to my new shoes, ended with me feeling tired but more than able to continue. I bet I'll feel exactly the same during the marathon, only I hope that feeling comes around Mile 20 instead of Mile 7. :)<br /><br />I've also resumed yoga. This Sunday, I decided to do some &quot;power yoga&quot; (i.e. more flowing and active than the average yoga) and discovered two things. One is that my hips are unbelievably tight from running, something yoga will help remedy. The other is that for the second time this week, yoga has helped alleviate an injury. My right index toe, which had been consistently hurting all week, got a ton of pressure on it on Sunday from yoga, and hasn't hurt since, just like my rolled ankle from Wednesday. Man, yoga is great!<br /><br />So the second week of training has been great. Next week is a stepback week on Hal Higdon's program. Every three weeks, I will be reducing mileage a little bit to rest and gear up for the next two hard weeks. Next week, though, will be a little different than a normal stepback week, since I will be not only doing more yoga, but I've decided to resume consistent weight lifting to help my body get stronger for the marathon. This will be the first time I've lifted weights with any regularity in almost four months, so this should be fun. See ya next week! <br /><br /><br /><br />"

WEDDING & ENGAGEMENT

MOTHER'S DAY

"event","Ah, another fun-filled insomnia night.  I actually think it's good for my body to stay up for a very long period of time.  Call it instinct, but I think that sometimes the insomnia is serving me rather than hindering me.  I usually feel great the day after a night like this, and end up developing a solid sleeping pattern the next night.  I guess I'll be prepared when I become a secret agent a la Jack Bauer.

So, the reason for this post.  Staying up late with nothing to do, I finally listened to the Arcade Fire's album Funeral all the way through, and loved it.  It's one of those weird things where I hadn't particularly liked any of the songs on their own (except Wake Up), and now I love them all as a cohesive whole.  For those of you that have been reading this for a while, you'll notice this is the exact opposite reaction I had to X & Y.  

After listening to Funeral, I ended up listening to Big Country's debut album, The Crossing, which is over twenty years old, and was struck dumb by how similar the two albums are in terms of sound and general energy.  I've never heard Big Country mentioned as an influence of the Arcade Fire, but they clearly are, whether it be subliminal or not.  Pretty crazy, man..."

"event","I can't explain what exactly has happened since I've gotten back to Los Angeles, but I've effectively reverted into a ten-year old.  Admittedly, a ten-year old with a solid work ethic (I've already done a third of my intercession work), but a ten-year old nonetheless.  

I've basically been doing nothing but playing old videogames, and when I mean nothing but, I mean it.  I feel like I'm hibernating, and I kinda love it and kinda hate it.  It's mostly hate though, because it makes me realize how much I love NYC and how much I love college and the independence and confidence it has given me.  

Going through my room at home, I've found tons of old relics that have given me surreal flashbacks into a past I barely remember.  I feel like two completely different souls caught in a stange purgatory where I'm aware of both, but the one from the past dominates and makes the new one uncomfortable and confused.  I've seen old pictures of me in high school, and been absolutely blown away at how different I look now.  I've found old CD's I burned for parties and friends I completely forgot about and can only remember in ghostly afterimages.

When I went running tonight with my father (close to 5 miles!), part of our route went by the neighborhood of an old friend, and I suddenly flashed on a totally different friend and a summer him and I shared that was one of my favorite summers of all time, but that I had virtually erased from my memory.  It was perhaps here more than at any other time on this trip that I felt like two different souls.

I realize why I don't like Los Angeles now more than ever.  Los Angeles was pretty much a past life for me, a life filled with great times and valuable lessons, but one that really is over for me.  I look and act like a wholly different person in New York, a much more mature and alive person.  In LA, I feel like I'm visiting the gravesite of my first life.  I know this is crazy, but I can't think of any other way to explain it.  

I feel quite uncomfortable in LA, almost like a ghost.  While I love my family, I think for my own health and sanity I need to get back to NY as soon as possible.  Hopefully my excuse to go back early, Peter's voiceover party, will happen sooner rather than later."

"event","It's rare when you come to a point in your life where you know with absolute certainity that something, no matter how minute or simple, has changed.  I feel like a new-born, confused and curious and cold.  

I have been walking in a daze these past couple of days, not completely clear where I am, and much less clear on who exactly I am.  This is inevitable considering that I'm effectively a semester away from graduating from college.  But that change has been a long time coming; this recent change is more profound.  And I have no idea what it is that has changed.  

Perhaps it's a recognition that next semester I will have to juggle more work than I've ever had to before:  I will likely be a working voiceover artist before next semester is out, and I will also be writing the most ambitious paper I've ever attempted.  But even with all that, this change is more personal, and it will likely be some time before I understand it completely.  

In any event, I acknowledge that things are different, and that the world as I knew it has shifted.  For the better or worse is yet to be determined.  I have a feeling, as strange as this sounds, that I'm changing into a more thoughtful and quiet person, but we'll see.  Change is almost always good for me, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed."

"event","School work is really starting to grab hold of me and I've been in the strangest mental state these past couple of weeks because of it.  I feel both exhausted and constantly engaged, elated and frustrated at the same time.  I think it's that I've become so used to SLC and its sneaky educational ways that I know exactly how I'm going to come out of this (final!) year of college.  

The information I'm going to obtain this year is quite unlikely to be used by me in any substantial or critical way in my life, but it will change the way I think and will allow me to converse with even more intellectuals from different walks of life.  Because of my particular SLC education, I can talk with people coherently and thoughtfully about architecture, japanese literature and history, the Bible,film history, urban anthropology, various forms of philosophers including existentialists, anglo-american analytics and machiavellian theorists, war and its many representations in literature, diplomacy and intelligence throughout the modern world, and lastly I'll be able to completely read Latin.  

How this will service a voice over career I can't imagine.  But it will service me as an educated and well-rounded human being, which is invaluable.  And besides, I can go to pretentious intellectual dinner parties for the free wine and actually know what I'm talking about so I won't get kicked out.  Man, that's my new motivation for surviving my tremendous workload this year: free wine several years down the road!  Score!"

But an article on the until now somewhat well written website IGN (which regardless of its writing is a terrific site for geekery of all kinds) has inspired me.  The whole article, which is a gushing review of the Batman Begins DVD, is the most adverb and adjective-filled writing I've experienced since Lenin's ""Left Wing Communism, An Infantile Disorder.""  That alone makes it worth reading for its humor value.  But one sentence, or rather an excerpt from an interminably long sentence, stands out to me as an example of just god-awful writing...

""...he combines viscera and palpable emotional dimension in an unforgettable cinematic alchemy, fulfilling the history of the character as well as creating a new screen mythology which will inspire decades of directors, storytellers and mythmakers for years to come.""

Notice anything just a bit off about this sentence?  No, you don't get points for noticing."

I was planning on starting again in September, and I will start posting regularly then, but I just noticed this great thread on a forum and felt inclined to post it.  Note that I'm cutting it for a reason: It's on Blog Wars, a site run by Stile, one of the big internet personalities and a guy into shock i.e. hardcore porn and violence.  I find his writing and websites fascinating, and occasionally you'll get really great discussions on the forum.

Anyhow, this particular discussion concerns that rabbit rapist (see, told ya!) that was just arrested in Australia.  Enjoy...

My 21st birthday was wonderful.  Experiencing the utter depression of a strip club, and playing pool while trying to avoid all the girls that wanted to dance, was actually more interesting and engaging than I thought it would be. I actually felt adult; in a bar, there are plenty of people underage.  But in a strip club, security tends to be tighter, and one gets the feeling that everyone in there is of age, an adult.  So definitely great stuff.

I did have the craziest Sunday, Monday and Tuesday though immediately after my birthday.  My flight back to New York was delayed by about two hours, which is much worse when one is going to a place three hours ahead.  Needless to say, I got in at 1:00 in the morning and didn't get back until 3 in the morning, when I collapsed.  I had to miss the morning of work the next day, and somewhat dazedly, I realized that Jeni had told me the night before she was flying in on Tuesday.  Before I knew it, Tuesday arrived and Jeni was in the admissions office!!

So, Jeni's been with me a week, and we've been doing shockingly well considering we've been living in extremely close quarters.  My workouts have been getting more and more challenging, and I've been trying to eat properly with mixed success (I don't think I have the discipline yet to eat perfectly for a whole day).  Touring and interviewing has been fun, with interviewing definitely becoming my preferred job and the one I will take without a doubt next year.  My voice over teacher has been e-mailing me a lot, which can be nothing but good.  So my life is good right now.  A bit odd, which will no doubt remedy itself once school starts.  But good, and much more fun and crazy with Jeni here. :)"

Seriously, it should be a great night, and the end of about six years of anticipation (we've been talking about going to this particular strip club on my twenty-first birthday for a looooooong time).  Wish me luck, y'all..."

For anyone interested in videogames, and really perhaps anyone interested in flat-out brilliant (and ballsy) storytelling, check out the game Killer 7.  I recommended it in my last post, but I've beaten it now and can say that it is without a doubt one of the most stunning artistic achievements I've seen.  Utterly original, unabashedly violent and vulgar, and a storyline that astounds and deeply moves you at the end.  Just amazing stuff, and the potential of a sequel at the very end makes me very happy.

Just know that the game is incredibly bizarre, and the violence might turn you off.  But if you stick with it, the game is deeply rewarding, more so than almost any game I've ever played.  

In 12 hours (since I was born around 1 in the afternoon), I'll be 21!  Woo-hoo!"

I'm back home, after one of the most aggravating trips I've been on.  My grandfather did not have a good time at all, mainly because he was depressed that he was making everyone work so hard to help him.  Therefore, he didn't enjoy anything we did, and as a result the trip was mostly a waste for him.  What irks me about this is that the failed trip took up three days of my vacation time here, but whatever.  It's quite sad to see my grandfather in the state he's in. :(

But it's over, and now I can relax and enjoy the last day that I can break the law by drinking.  With that said, I'm off to play Killer 7.  Don't know what that is?  Look it up.  You'll be freaked out, I guarantee it.

"event","Well, we just celebrated July 4th with a fireworks EXTRAVAGANZA, which means a bunch of dinky fireworks in my backyard that all together cost about a hundred dollars less than the wonderful sushi dinner we had tonight for my grandfather's birthday.

My family is so amazing.  We really don't fight, ever.  We get into arguments, sure, and sometimes we'll have full-scale yelling matches, but they never end up being extremely serious.  Only one or twice have there ever been serious arguments, and they always have a positive outcome.  I don't think we've had a true fight in years, and that makes me so happy and feel so lucky.  

Interestingly, that has translated into the ""fights"" I have with Jeni.  We've only had one very serious fight, admittedly enough to almost break us up.  But we both realized what we had to do to keep the relationship going, we did those things, and our relationship improved tenfold after that.  I can't tell you how nice it is to have a relationship where we don't fight but rationally discuss problems.  It makes us pay more attention to each other and the little things we do 
so that we identify the issue right away and deal with it before it gets crazy.  It also allows for less stress and more comfort with telling each other the truth and saying what's on our minds.  It's really a beautiful and rare thing, and just makes me realize how great love can truly be.

"event","I just got finished reading a blog of an old friend of mine from Los Angeles, and he described a party he'd attended with all of my old friends from high school, and it seems that NOTHING has changed.  Certainly, we all have distance now, and thus new experiences we can share with each other, but still.  People are still living in the same places, doing the same drugs, going to the same hangouts.  The prospect of going back to L.A. this week is making me realize why I left and have no plans to go back except for my family.

Last night, at a lovely dinner party in Manhattan, people were remarking yet again how I don't seem like I'm from California.  This has happened my whole life, and in reading about stagnation amongst my friends from California, I understand why people say it.  I have a spirit that needs to be active, to change and explore and have adventure.  I like to be constantly moving on my two feet to new and exciting places, not in a car on the way to a place I've been a thousand times before.  

I realize that I originally mistook this as Los Angeles being a boring and dead town that couldn't compare whatsoever to New York.  While I do think there's some truth to this (mainly that Los Angeles can't compare to New York as a city, but that's for another post), I've grown enough this summer to understand that Los Angeles is simply what it is, and it has wonderful things to claim (perfect weather for one thing).  I was the one who couldn't cope with it, who couldn't handle how laid back the city is.  Now I'm in a city that's constantly moving, where people are constantly connected to each other and form a cohesive community (check out that alliteration, man!), and I adore it.  It's exactly right for me, crazy weather and all.

So L.A., you work for a certain kind of person, but that person ain't me.  New York, you work for a very different kind of person than L.A., and that person is me.  So while I love my family, I need change, and L.A. can't give that to me.     There is certainly a pleasantness in doing the same thing, in relaxing into a familiar and comfortable pattern.  But I guess I'm the kind of soul that doesn't like comfort, that finds joy in experiencing the unknown.  So L.A., I'm happy to visit you, but happier to return to my true home."

"event","Well, I'm writing from my uncle's apartment after a fabulous Italian dinner, and am damn tired.  I've been realizing something scary recently; I'm getting older.  Admittedly, I'm quite young (21 next week) but I already can't eat in the crazy way I used to be able to.  I ate a lot on the July 4th weekend, really way too much, and was sick for days afterwards.  Last night, I ate badly (as in not eating to optimize working out) and felt weird all night.  So this makes me sad, but also good cause it's quickly convincing me to eat healthy from now on.  

Tomorrow I'll be on a plane to L.A., where I am going to kick back for a week and turn 21 in the process.  Not a bad deal at all, and maybe I'll finally catch up on sleep.  I'm in a very calm and happy place right now.  But more importantly, I'm in an excited anticipatory place, because my love Jeni is going to come live with me sooner than I thought, possibly the week I come back!  Yay!!!  

So, there you go.  My life is a bit boring and simple right now, but in many respects, that's exactly what I need at the moment.  Good stuff.


P.S.  Two musical artists y'all should check out, courtesy of my friend Evan.  The first is Sufjan Stevens, in particular 
his 50 states project, which currently has two wonderful albums about Michigan and Illinois.  Illinoise, the most recent album, is breathtaking, and I've been listening to it all day.  The other artist is Clap Your Hands Say Yeah.  Their self-titled debut is remarkably confident and consistent, and there are a couple of flat-out brilliant songs on it, in particular In This Home On Ice.  Enjoy."

"event","So my 21st birthday is next week, and as part of the celebration, my dad was going to come out this Wednesday to New York, and we were going to hang out for a couple of days before me, my uncle and my dad flew out to L.A. for the big week.  However, in one of the best cover-ups I've ever experienced, Dad actually flew out on July 4th (!) and surprised me by showing up today.  But not only did he show up today, he surprised me by nonchalantly sitting in the waiting room and going on tour with me! :)

Man, was that cool.  I have to hand it to my entire family, who kept it completely under wraps for weeks.  It was without a doubt one of the neatest things that has ever happened to me (I'm grinning ear to ear writing this).  Of course, it did kinda mess things up a tiny bit since I bought dinner for the next two nights, so that's probably gonna go to waste.  But oh well.  It's definitely worth some wasted food to go out to dinner with my dad all week!

So yeah, I'm a very happy camper right now.  A tired camper (I had an insane weekend, especially Sunday, which saw me both get extremely sick from overeating and extremely stressed due to my cell phone dying and me having to find a new phone on July 4th), but a damn happy one.  I really am so lucky to have such a great family.  They have taught me so much about what it means to be a good person, and I can only hope that I can carry those lessons to my children.  Sigh... :)"

"event","Well y'all, it's official.  I now own an iPod.  And not just any iPod, but a Special Edition U2 iPod.  Yes, the one that is black and red and thus cooler than yours. :)

Seriously, this was an amazing birthday present, and I have my wonderful uncle to thank for it.  So again, Dave, thank you very very very much.  This is a perfect present; something I would have likely never invested in on my own, but will get much use and happiness out of.  

Oh, and also, if anyone out there is interested in buying the Complete U2 on iTunes (it's awesome by the way, and an incredible bargain considering how much you get), I am willing to give you the 50 dollar off coupon I got with the iPod.  Just comment on this entry with your e-mail address and I'll send it to ya.  First come, first serve.

So now I get to sit and wait for the iPod to upload my music, which should only take an insanely long time considering I have over 3000 songs to upload into it....    Sigh.


Update: Took about 45 minutes.  Not bad, but longer than I thought.  Works great though. Yay!"

"event","So I'm a moderate when it comes to politics.  I believe that it makes sense to not side with one party, but to look at the issues from all sides and make an educated choice about them.  Therefore, I don't think that Bush is the most evil man of all time (he's pretty terrible as a world leader a lot of the time though).  I also think Howard Dean needs to be thrown out of his position as chairman of the DNC immediately; he's crazy and is alienating the Democrats to a point that we're having some ridiculous partisan fighting in politics right now that can only hurt the Democrats.

All that said, here's an awesome Bush joke that I just read.  Enjoy. :)



Q: How many Bush Administration officials does it take to change a light bulb?

A: None. There is nothing wrong with the light bulb; its conditions are improving every day. Any reports of its lack of incandescence are delusional spin from the liberal media. That light bulb has served honorably, and anything you say undermines the lighting effect. Why do you hate illumination?"

"event","So I feel obligated to do this, if only because I feel it necessary to warn people.  I'm definitely a Coldplay fan, and have enjoyed many things from their first two albums: Chris Martin's voice is unique and thus interesting to listen to, their music is sometimes gorgeous, like The Scientist from their second album, and their songs are usually epic and quite U2-ish, and since U2 are probably my favorite band of all time, I enjoy Coldplay very much.  

Recently, there has been a huge backlash against Coldplay, and I couldn't figure out why.  Yes, Keane has a better singer, better lyrics and show ultimately more promise than Coldplay did after their first album, but why does that mean one should lash out against Coldplay?  Then I heard X & Y, their new album, and I understand why.  The album highlights almost everything that isn't good about Coldplay, and thus, it's pretty damn boring.

I rarely completely agree with published reviews of films or albums, but Rolling Stone's review of X & Y is spot on, down to the two good songs on the album.  It's not that there's a bad or glaring song, it's that they all basically run together.  The album is too epic, and much worse, too forced.  Even U2 knows when to have quiet songs on albums, and in fact, the quiet songs are often the best.  The best U2 songs, like One or I Still Haven't Found, are epic but have a quiet, personal feeling to them.  

Except for two songs on X & Y, namely Fix You and Kingdom Come, all the songs sound exactly the same.  What makes those two songs stand out is that they focus on Chris Martin's voice rather than burying it in a wall of sound, and Kingdom Come actually has a simple acoustic guitar as the main instrument, which makes it instantly more accessible than basically everything else on the album.  Sigh...

Also, on a side note, Coldplay's drummer, Will Champion, is really bad.  I hate to say that considering that I have deep respect for drummers, but Champion consistently creates either forgettable beats or riffs that are too complicated for the song.  Like most of the album, he's trying way too hard to be cool, and it falls terribly flat.  Even probably the best epic song on the album, the aforementioned Fix You, suffers from a terrible beat that tries to be epic but services itself rather than the song; the song is still lovely, but the beat seriously hurts the climax of the song.  Clocks is another example of a song with a just terrible beat that undermines an otherwise lovely and creative song.  

So check out the album, but use iTunes, and buy Fix You and Kingdom Come.  You'll be very happy and only be out two dollars.  I'm probably done with Coldplay now unless they put out an acoustic album, which is sad.  But what Rolling Stone said about them is very true: they're really a small acoustic band at heart, ad on X & Y, they're trying way too hard to be U2, and failing on almost every count.



Update:      

Well, one thing that I always love is a brand new experience, and X & Y has given it to me.  While I still dislike the album as a whole, I'm stunned to find that when I play most of the individual songs on their own, out of the context of the album, they tend to be really good.  I've never really experienced this before on such a carefully constructed album, where a poor grouping of songs lessens their individual impact.  One song in particular, The Hardest Part, is an endlessly catchy and pretty song, and I never noticed it until I played it randomly the other day.  It's odd, because this album is definitely not a singles album; the songs are too long and for the most part intricate for that. But there you go.  I still think the album is boring as a whole, and that Coldplay should release an acoustic album and fire their drummer, but the songs are much stronger than I thought.  Strange..."

I don't know why I have some sort of hesitation when it comes to Livejournal, but I do, and therefore, I think I update about once every two months or so.  I will do a crazy update soon though, I promise.  

Anyhow, it seems that lately (as in the last week or so) news from around the world has been getting funnier.  I think the Onion is starting to rub off on the real world.  But the article below absolutely takes the cake, especially the headline.  Enjoy!

	
Cannonball fired for fear of flying 

Colin Blackstock
Thursday June 16, 2005
The Guardian

A human cannonball has been fired from his job because he is afraid of flying.

Todd Christian, 26, was sent flying through the air each night at speeds of up to 60mph at the Cottle & Austen circus.

He had been their acrobatic daredevil since February, but hurt his knee in an accident.

When his employers wanted to send him to Brazil for training to help deal with G-forces caused by being shot from the cannon he refused because he was afraid of flying in planes for long periods. 

 Mr Christian said his lawyer was examining whether he can begin a legal claim for unfair dismissal.

""The circus wanted to send me to have further training at the Guiana space centre in Brazil because they were worried I would hurt myself again,"" he said. ""I know it sounds silly because I'm a human cannonball, but I don't like long flights and if I'm on a plane for a long time I start to panic. So I refused to go and they sacked me on the spot. I am devastated.""

Marnie Dock, the circus' cannon trainer after becoming the world's first female cannonball at 16, said Mr Todd had had to be fired for his own safety. She said: ""We are very strict about the people we take on because it can be a very dangerous stunt.

""Without the proper training in Brazil it would be too dangerous for him to continue his career as a human cannonball. He's a great guy and we offered him another job but he refused. We are trying to resolve it without taking it to the courts, but as far as our lawyers are concerned Todd doesn't have a leg to stand on.""

The role has been taken over by Brazilian Diego Zeman, known as Diego the Human Rocket."

"event","So, this is an extremely oddball time of the day to be posting, but I
can't go to sleep, and the thoughts that are going to come out here are
why. 

Today, I saw a girl that I almost asked out on campus being
held by a man I've met on campus. It surprised me, mainly to see the
kind of person she was attracted to, but I didn't give it much thought
for the rest of the day. But then I started thinking about why I was
attracted to this girl. She's certainly pretty, though not really my
type. And, lying in bed thinking, I realized it was her bubbly
personality; she made me smile. And that led to Jeni.

When I break down what Jeni gives me, it's rather astonishing. I went
out with Jeni at a turning point in my life both emotionally and
physically; I was finally recovered from an extremely painful breakup
and ready to date again, and I was just beginning the commitment to
weight training that has now become an integral part of my life. Jeni
was literally exactly what I needed. Jeni is beautiful (the more I
think about it and look at her, the more I realize she's exactly my
type, from the gorgeous eyes to the long hair and other things that
aren't PG-rated). She's one of the most quirky and fun-loving people
I've ever met, which was and still is what I needed then. I had been in
a funk (and been in a not so fun relationship) for so long that I
needed someone to brighten my day every time I saw her. The girl
mentioned above did that, but I can see how Jeni goes deeper than that
girl in terms of happiness, how when she is in a good mood will be
endlessly goofy and fun-loving and patient with someone who needs to be
happier themselves.

Jeni's also got her quirks, which I definitely love to both exploit and
revel. It's no fun when only one person's crazy in the relationship! :)
Her and I have similar interests, which means we can understand each
other tastes and give each other presents that mean something. Also,
she's a fit person that dedicates herself to getting better physically,
whether that be through DDR or her own body through weight training and
cardio work. She inspires me and I inspire her. You can't ask for
better than that.

Thinking about all this, I realize how amazingly lucky I am to have
Jeni as a companion, and how much fun and how rewarding a strong
relationship can be for two people. Sure, we've had our serious fights,
but I think we care too much about each other to let those things
damage us. It's like weight training; you have to damage and tear apart
your muscles before they can grow back stronger. This has happened for
both of us in our relationship; we've fought and really hurt each
other, but we adapt, learn about each other, and grow stronger.

I still very much admire and care about the girl I saw today, and maybe
if I'd gone out with her I would have found similar things to what I
have now. But I can't believe it. It's rare, but sometimes you find
something that just fits, something that makes sense to you. That I
found two things like that, weight training and Jeni, virtually in the
same week is unbelievable. Thank you Jeni for everything you give me.
And thank you to that girl today for making me realize why I wanted to go out
with her, and how much of that I found in my companion. Sigh.... :)"

"event","Well, since this seems to be all the rage, figured I'd do this too.  Note that a lot of these are abbreviated to fit better, so for example my street, which is really West 82nd, becomes West, and my high school becomes Roads instead of New Roads.  Also, the pornstar name one seems wrong to me, since it assumes that one's first pet will automatically fit one's gender.  Anyhow, enjoy.

"event","Well, the second semester has started, and with it, possibly the seeds of what I want to do with my life have been planted.  What has caused me to be so sappy (note the subtle pun) and metaphorical all of a sudden?  Read on, my friends, read on.

Two major things have happened, one by accident and the other by my perseverance and determination.  The first is that I have finally, after much searching and experimentation, arrived at a fitness program that not only makes the most sense of any fitness program I have seen, but has also gotten my body into an incredibly balanced and healthy place, and this is only after one week!  The second is that I have finally started the journey of trying to become a voice actor by both e-mailing a potential voice over teacher and after basically a whole morning of web surfing found two books that should help me with the process.

The fitness program happened when I got injured during the great but not for me weight training program by Bill Pearl that I was following.  It was an injury that was accidental and no fault of anyone's, but enough to keep me away from the gym for a week or so.  During that week, I discovered that not only was I not as strong as I had thought (the injury being an example of that) but that I was extremely inflexible and that I had no cardiovascular ability.  Doesn't sound like being in shape to me!

A couple of days after the injury, I was in a bookstore and chanced upon the program I am on now.  It's called Wholistic Fitness by Steve Ilg, and it is, in a word, unreal.  In one week, I am sorer than I have ever been from any sort of fitness program (cross country, navy seal, heavy lifting) and, due to the yoga (!) in the program, I feel more flexible than I've ever felt.  Also, the cardio has made me not get winded from a couple of fairly crazy adventures I've had this week (as in racing to get to the train). 

The point of the program, as you've probably gathered, is balance.  It has five fitness principles attached to it: Weight Training, Yoga, Cardio, Meditation and Nutrition.  You only do one or two a day, and you end up doing at least one or two six days a week.  The Weight Training is by far the hardest fitness experience I've ever had, and this is using less weight and occasionally less reps than Bill Pearl's program.  There are techniques that Ilg uses that challenge the body to an insane level, but it would take too long to explain them here.

The Yoga is phenomenal and really complements the weights, and vice versa.  The cardio is obviously great to do for general fitness, nutrition is always important, and meditation, while so far the least important thing, helps a lot with posture and focus, which is crucial.  So, if any of you guys are interested, search for Total Body Transformation on Amazon.  Fantastic book, and while a bit New Agey, it will get you into fantastic shape.

The voice acting stuff is very tentative in terms of what exactly I'm going to do, but hopefully this program I'm looking at, PDR, will work out.  It's relatively cheap, recommended by voice acting agents, located in Manhattan, and seems to offer workshops year-round.  The books look great too.  More on this later.

What I've realized is what I might want to do with my life.  Either work as a video game writer or voice actor/radio DJ as a main profession, and over the summer work as a physical trainer.  These are all things I love, have had some experience in, and have been told am good at.  Doesn't seem like a bad life to me. :)"

"event","Well well.  The long wait is about to be over.  I am about to be with my love, Jeni.  She I think said it first, but sometimes you just find something that fits, and that's definitely what has happened to both of us.  We just work well together.  We give so much to each other, and at least from my end of the deal, I am made extremely happy and sane whenever I'm around her.  The fact that she's beautiful to boot is a great bonus. :)

So, I probably won't be updating too much while she's around, so until we get back to school probably, have a great rest of the break everyone, and I'll see most of you back at the good ol SLC.  And best of luck to everyone who's going abroad!"

"event","Well, I have to update regarding the day I had yesterday, since it was one of the most magical and happy experiences I've ever had.  And what place could this happen?  Well, only the happiest place on Earth: Disneyland.

For those that don't know, I am obsessed with Disneyland, the theme park in Anaheim California.  I love Disney cartoons, of course, but there's something about that park specifically that just places me in a constant state of awe: it is such a beautiful vision, and I have seen countless children enchanted by it.  And then, to top it all off, adults get enchanted there too.  It's an incredible place, and I've probably been there at least thirty times, and plan on going many more.  However, yesterday I had probably the best experience I've ever had at Disneyland.  I got to see Disneyland through the eyes of a child.

My family and I took Cora, mentioned in the previous post, to Disneyland on her last full day in California.  I have never been to Disneyland with a four year old, and let me tell you, if you love Disneyland and/or magic, you've gotta do it.  It was fascinating to watch: She started scared and overwhelmed, which makes sense.  But then she saw Eyore.  She was extremely shy, and the guy playing Eyore, brilliantly, acted shy of her too.  And then, suddenly, she realized that Eyore was safe, and ended up hugging him and kissing him all over.  Eventually, she hugged and kissed Tigger and Pooh too.  It was so neat to watch, and after that, she was a happy camper.

Her favorite ride by far was It's A Small World.  This is a ride I've never loved, and indeed, the theme music grates on me to the point where I've wished I could just shoot out the speakers.  But with Cora, I realized what Small World does so well; it presents just tons and tons of neat things to see and experience for a four year old, way too many for one ride, and thus Cora wanted to go on it about eighty times.  She ended up going on it three times, and next time she comes, she'll ride on it many more.  Adults probably think it's pretty; kids think it's a whole other world.

We then went to Toontown where she went into Minnie's house and met with Minnie.  We then went to the parade, and after that, Cora proceeded to do the most amazing thing I've seen a four year old do; she fell soundly asleep for THREE hours.  Nothing stirred her, including extremely loud marching bands in the next parade and people accidentally slamming into her stroller.  She was OUT.  Forutnately, she woke up for the best experience of all: Goofy's Kitchen.

Goofy's Kitchen is a buffet that has a feature known as character dining: the Disney characters, especially Goofy and usually Aladdin or the Mad Hatter and sometimes rarities like Donald, come to your table and mess with you or playaround.  It's great fun, and to top it all off, the food is shockingly good, sometimes great.  It's expensive, but worth every penny.  Last night, though, Goofy's Kitchen came alive in the best way.

I had, for some reason, never realized that the food was designed to be a kid's dream.  On a lower level so that little kids can reach it, they have great kid food, like Gooferoni, and Cora and my favorite, Peanut Butter and Jelly Pizza!  And then, on a higher level, they have food for grown-ups, like Glazed Salmon or BBQ Ribs, both delicious.  And then they have what can be best described as a gargantuan desert bar, featuring larger-than life deserts that satisfy both kids and adults, since they're silly most of the time (Goof Cake, Gummi Worms in Fudge Mud), filled to the brim with sugar, and happen to be the tastiest deserts I've ever had at a buffet.  The cheesecake alone is worth the price of admission.

Of course, we can't forget the characters, which Cora adored.  Alice, Dale, Aladdin, Goofy, and Donald all had fun with Cora, signing her autograph book and taking great pictures with her.  They were all wonderful with her, and Goofy in particular had fun with her, signing her autograph book and then signing the table covering in front of her! :)  It was the first time that the characters were enchanting to me at Goofy's Kitchen, and on top of that, they had fun dances and interactive pots and pans banging for the kids, which Cora loved and somehow wasn't annoying even to the adults (the dance is the only remix of the Macarena I've heard that doesn't instantly grate on me).  It was one of the top dining experiences I've ever had, and easily the most magical.

At the end of the day, I had to say goodbye to Cora for another year, which was very sad.  She is such an amazing kid, so mature and honest.  She will do great things in life, I'm sure of it.  I can't wait to go to Disneyland with her in about ten or twenty years, just to see how she responds to it then.  I know she'll love it forever; she has this spirit where she embraces magic fully, but has to decide that it is truly magic first, like with Eyore.  Last night, she decided that Disneyland was truly magic, and got swept away.  Well, so did I, Cora.  What a great, happy day; it's not every day you see magic happen right before your eyes."

"event","Well, well.  I don't know why I'm doing this, but I guess due to pressure from certain people I'm obligated to update my livejournal.  So here goes.  A warning: I'm writing this after an extremely long and wonderful but exhausting day.  As soon as I'm done with this, I'm going to bed.  You've been warned.

So, I'm back in Los Angeles.  And yes, as always, LA is lovely but, at least for me, extremely dull.  I have always felt that I was born in the wrong place, that I'm really a New Yorker.  The pace in New York is just so much more my style; I think I feel better, look better, and just in general act better when I'm in New York.  I'm more... me.  So in LA, life becomes like a very uneventful vacation. And for the first week of this vacation, it was exactly that.  Until Saturday.

First off, on Thursday I had one of the most intense and exciting workouts I've ever experienced.  My energy levels were really high, and for some reason my muscles were just ready to work.  So let's just say that I went up at least 10 pounds on every exercise, some 20 pounds, and on one leg exercise, 45 pounds!  It was just amazing, and it really got me ready for the weekend, which I knew would be fun.  I had no idea.

On Saturday, Christmas Day, we went to my parent's old friends (we're talking elementary school!) house for a wonderful dinner and gift giving extravaganza.  The great tradition at these get-togethers is that my dad and his friend Tom give each other the stupidest, silliest presents they can find for each other.  Examples here were a HoverDisc (which actually sort of hovered) and a disgusting drink called FruitSi (which Tom thoughtfully wrote Tootsie in front of, so it looked like the drink was called Tootsie Fruitsi.  Excellent stuff).

Well, this Christmas, I was initiated into this tradition by Tom, who gave me a trash bag stuffed to the brim with incredibly stupid presents (we're talking at least 15 here!).  Highlights were Dried Salted Prunes (also included were Dried Salted Prunes with Chili), an extremely androgynous firefighter action figure, Peanut Butter and Jelly candies with actual jelly in the center, and Boing Soda.  There were many more, but those are just the ones off the top of my head.

So, my dad and I actually attempted to consume most of these items, and shockingly, only the Fruitsi bowled us over to the point where we had to recover for about an hour afterward.  Second place for most awful had to be the Peanut Butter and Jelly candies, which were just impossible to chew, much less digest.  Great times.

It was actually a lovely party, with everyone in really high spirits and even the dogs (Tom's wife Leslie is a celebrity in the dog breeding and dog magazine world, so she has tons of beautiful collies in her home) were well-behaved and never disruptive.  But the best part of the weekend came in the middle of the Christmas party.

My cousin's daughter, Cora (short for Corazon) and my aunt Mary flew in from Oregon to visit us until New Year's Day.  Cora is four and possibly the cutest and most intelligent little kid I've ever been around.  She's articulate, very clever with physical things like Lego's, and just an absolute joy to be around.  Dad and I picked them up from the lovely Burbank airport and took them to the party.  

Cora and I are somehow much closer then we were last year, and she loves to hang out with me so much that I've sort of become her babysitter while the adults talk and relax.  And I just love it.  I've actually, to my surprise and delight, been teaching her things.  I've so far taught her how to count to ten on her fingers (she can count very high, but never learned how to do it with her fingers), that the moon is so big that everywhere that it's night in the world people there can see it, and in an incredible episode tonight that I'll detail below, taught her that it's better to eat ice cream with a spoon instead of with her fingers.

So, the ice cream deal.  Well, we all went to Souplantation tonight, and had a ball as always.  But what happened at the end of the night was best, and produced some pictures that I'm sure I'll be blackmailed with later.  I got Cora ice cream for desert, but she wasn't clear on what she wanted, so I ended up getting two different bowls of ice cream and finally mixing them together to make one gloppy mess.  Cora loved it and played with the glop with her spoon, and then decided to eat it with her fingers instead of the spoon.  I'm a little fuzzy on how this happened, but eventually her and I got into a contest to see how many fingers, all with ice cream on them, we could put in our mouths at once.  It was extremely silly, but the best part was that we counted from one finger to all ten fingers on our hands as we did it, so that she got practice counting on her hands at the same time.  And then, to top it all off, I showed her that now that our fingers were all sticky, it wasn't very fun to have sticky fingers.  Thus, it's better to eat ice cream with a spoon, since you'll get more ice cream that way and your fingers won't be sticky.  And she definitely agreed.  So see, counting, fun and table manners all in one event.  Great stuff.

I also, of all things, introduced her to Mario 64 today.  Being a video game fanatic, this was close to my heart, and to my shock and delight, she adores Mario.  She loves watching him jump around, and her favorite thing is when he turns metal and walk underwater.  She also loved the baby penguin and the mommy penguin.  God, what a great game! :)

And that's about it.  We ate fruit pops and played Mario, and then I put her to bed and sat down here.  So, that's my life.  I'm having an absolute ball, other than of course missing Jeni very very much.  But in less than ten days, we'll be together and everything will be so much more... content.  I dunno;  I think I've realized that for me love boils down to being passionate and dedicated to someone to the point where you're just not content and sane unless you're around them.  And Jeni, you definitely make me content and sane.  I love you, hon.  

OK, well, I'm exhausted and this should be enough to keep everyone happy for a while.  I'll probably update again, and I'm planning a huge review of everything U2 has done, since I got the Complete U2 Box Set as a present, and I think it'd be a good writing exercise.  So look out for that.  Until next time, I hope everyone's happy and warm and safe.  Good night."

"event","I just came home from school and tip-toed upstairs to kiss my Jakey goodnight.  He always sleeps in what looks like an uncomfortable position so I repositioned him and tucked the blankets back around him that were hanging off the bed.  As I sat on the bed and watched him sleep tonight I had the most overwhelming feeling of gratefulness.  Jacob has been the most incredible gift in my life.  Being his mom has given me so much.  And I know that it had to be him, things had to happen exactly the way that they did so that I would have that exact sweet little soul.  When I look at him I see my heart.  I want so much to wrap my arms around him and protect him from the world.  But what a loss that would be to the world, for he has so much to give.  So instead I hope that I can give him the foundation that he needs for a happy life and I whisper what I always whisper in his ear after he falls asleep ""Mommy loves you, you are so loved. Sweetest dreams my sunshine."""

"event","Ok, I'm back from school, teeth brushed, ready for bed.  Then I realize I didn't eat dinner.  Hmm..when did I eat last?  11:30 am.  Shit, I did it again!  I have absolutely no appetite.  If I'm not reminded to eat, I just don't!  I'm down to 107 lbs!  That is the skinniest I have ever been! That's actually scary thin for me.  I've lost 12 lbs in about a month, not cool.  Maybe I should set calendar reminders to remember to eat! hehe :)"

"event","When I close my eyes I can see your bright blue eyes looking back at me, the length of your beautiful lashes that any girl would envy, the creases of your ever-present smile.  I can feel the warmth of your hug and hear the sweetness of your voice as you give me one of your thoughtful compliments.  
I close my eyes again and think of yours and I am searching, searching for what I missed.  I still can't see it, I was so blind to it.  Blind to the pain behind those bright blue eyes, behind your cool, peaceful smile.  Too wrapped up in me and my life to notice the pain in yours.  Forgive me my sweet friend, forgive me for not seeing what you needed.  If only now I could explain to you your importance in our lives.  If only now it was not too late and my words could make a difference.  You were loved.  You are loved.  Your life had a purpose and you will not be forgotten my dear, dear friend."

"event","It always feels nice to notice a hot guy checking you out from the car next to you.  But it's even better (and rare) when you glance over and see the guy smiling at you, move his car forward to get a better look and crank his head around to make sure he has your attention!  hehe :)  Of course I'm thinking, ""Doesn't he see my daughter in the back seat?""  Sometimes I think people just think I'm the nanny :)

Is it wrong that I consider this a random act of kindness?? It sure started my morning off right :) hehe :)"

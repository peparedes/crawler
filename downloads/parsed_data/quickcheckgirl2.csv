"event","Wow I guess I kinda forgot I still had a livejournal. I'm pretty sure once I stated school I completely stopped writing. Not like I have anything important to write about. It seems school has distracted me from all the things I used to do, and all the people I used to see. but now it's summer so maybe that will change...

well I'll be a senior in the fall. My last year at UArts. It's great and all but I kinda thought I would have big plans for what I'm going to be doing with myself after graduation. There are some things I would like to do and I'm sure I can do them. But its a question of finding the right people to do them with. Lately I've been thinking about starting a Artist Studio Collective, where I can have my own painting studio, and rent out studio space to other artists. I would also like to have communal spaces, a wood shop, screen printing area, and maybe even a metal shop. I was even thinking about turning part of the space into a gallery so the artists in the collective could show there work and invite other artists to show there as well. This all sounds great to me, but I've come to realize that I can't do it all alone. I thought long and hard that if I expect to do this I need to find motivated, responsible and serious artists who are siked on the idea. That and the whole money thing is kinda getting in the way but hey...I'm sure everything will work out.

For now Its nice to see a few of you still write here... staying true to your roots is what its all about!  
sometimes you just need a break from myspace with all them creepsters stalking you and shit. well I'll leave it at that like I said before I don't really have anything important to write about...."

"event","I kind of disappear now and then. not by choice really, i've just been busy. i'm back home for the summer, but i've been working a lot. i finally found a place to live in philly, so i wont be homeless when i get back. i miss a lot of people, and others i wish i could get rid of( no one on here so don;t worry, its not you!) it's good to be home, but at the same time i can't get any work done here. there's no space for me to do my art and it drives me nuts. i finally have some time to work on my own stuff, but i'm lacking the space and proper materials. i have a lot less stress now that i'm out of school and i found a place to live. but now that i'm not as busy, there's more time to think about bullshit i've been avoiding. idk what to do with myself. my moods have gone up and down dramatically lately. idk what the fuck is going on. all i know is things need to change.

i bought the new bouncing souls album.  it's great (not like i expected it not to be)and makes me very very happy! i can't stop listening to it. if you don't have it get it now!"

"event","Last night I went to first friday. For those of you who don't know, In Philly, on the first friday of every month, a bunch of galleries are open for free. So last night I went to this one gallery. The installations were pretty cool and I saw a lot of interesting stuff I would have never thought of. Going to galleries usually inspire me and make me want to go home and create. But for some reason last night I stood there and thought, will I ever be good enough to have my own show.? I think my work is pretty descent but but lately I feel my creativity is lacking. It might be because in school im forced to draw and paint stuff im not interested in. I spend soo much of my time doing work for school, that I don't have the time to do my own work. Even when I get the time, im to sick of drawing or painting crap all day, that I don't feel like doing anymore. I'm putting so much effort into my school art, that my own art and creativity is suffering. I used to make art just for the love of it and now I have to for a grade. I've got all A's and my professors want me to tutor next year, but I feel like im missing something. 
Im working on a paper for writing class and the topic is ""MY ART VISION"". I came to a stand still writing this because idk any more what my vision is. Growing up all I wanted to do was paint. Art is my life and I don't know what or who I am with out it. I just want to make art for the love of making it, and the whole time im here im told that's not good enough. My writing teacher said, ""to be a good artist, your art should have an effect on society."" but i don't feel i should strive to create art for that purpose alone. Yeah I want people to connect with my art and have it effect society. But giving me those limits will only diminish my creativity. Shouldn't my goal be to make art for the love of making it, and hope that someone along the way will connect with it as I do. Maybe im not looking at it in a business way of making money and surviving, but if your just looking for money, get a new profession. Art is about the love and passion of creating art, not about how much cash you can walk away with."

the only thing that has stayed the same is my family and the few friends i have left from Nutley. but every thing here sucks. i woke up at 3:45pm because it was my day off. i feel like i'm wasting my life away.

"event","last night,  after i got out of class at 7, i met up with my sister and went to the Pennywise show. it was awesome. me and my sis tore up the place and kick a few guys asses. they played a lot of old stuff and some of the new. the show ended at 11 but we left at 10:45 cause we had Harry Potter tickets. i really wanted to stay till the end of the show, but we left right after Fuck Authority which is an amazing song.  so i was happy. 

then we took a cab to the movie theater to see Harry Potter. we got there around 11 and the line was a whole city block long. then we stood outside for an hour freezing our asses off. when we finally got inside, it was fucking crazy. we spent 22$ on snacks and drinks. the place was packed but we got really good sets. the movie was AWESOME...sooo good! even though they left some stuff out. by the time we got out it was 3am. then i took a cab home and passed out.

i just woke up at 1:30 it feels good to sleep in. i love that i don't have class on fridays.

"event","well i'm back from Jamaica! it's good to be home. nicole and i had an awesome time, but i think a week is to long to spend there. i missed my cell phone and talking to mark.  i spent $50 bucks on phone cards and a dollar to connect each time which was a pain in the ass.i all so missed real chocolate, orange juice, Poland Spring water, and ketchup...it's the little things that count.

i didn't like that the hotel only had one clock so u never knew the time. the towel hut never had clean towels and when they did the guy wouldn't give me one so i had to stand there while he hit on me. and this annoying entertainment guy Damion who kept bordering us and proposed to nicole...haha, but yeah he was irritating. and the scary Jamaican jet ski man that wanted to take me on a ride to a special place for a date. and the power kept going out and there were lots of bugs. and that the second question out of everyones mouth was ""are u single""...get over it i'm takin. 

...but on the up side we, slept until 12 in our ocean front room, all u can eat buffet for lunch and dinner, sit in/by the pool/beach for several hours. we played water polo and volley ball. went to a beach party and the bar & club...no drinking age in Jamaica. we also saw a steel drum band and a Jamaican ra-sta band. drove the jet skies around. then we went on the glass bottom bout and sang some songs with the jamaicans, swam in a cave and jumped off a 35ft cliff into the cave...what a rush. 

on the plain ride back home nicole and i were supposed to sit in the 2nd to last row with this guy, but the back row was empty so we sat back there instead and got to spread out and put our feet up...better then first class id say. i took a nice nap and was on my way back to jersey. 

i had an awesome trip but i'm glad to be home. the most disappointing thing though, is that i took so many great pictures and on the last night i was there i lost my digital camera. i left my address & number so if they find it they can mail it to me...but what are my chances.

now that i'm home hit up my cell and we'll hang out before i move to Philly on the 26th."

"event","so Kyle and I are stupid...but i'll get to that part later.

i went down to Nutley yesterday to hang out with my good friend Kyle. we went to the dinner as usual, then off the shop right to visit JC at work. we paged him to the back of the store like we were costumers in need of assistance, to JC's surprise it was us. we then took JC to BK on his break. after we drooped him back at work we went to Kyle's house to think of something to do...and think we did.

there was nothing left to do in Nutley so at 8pm we decided to go on a little road trip to Sea Side. i couldn't take my car cause it stalls so we called up Michelle and she drove, that wasn't such a good idea either. all was well until 9pm and a few blocks from the board walk Michelle's car started smoking. we pulled over in a gas station, and the guy there ""tried"" to help us out. unfortunately he had no idea what he was talking about. so tried to drive to another gas station. well, the car stalled at a light and we barley got it to the corner of the road. we left a sign on the car that read ""my car is broken please don't give me a ticket"" because it was one hour parking. Michelle called her dad and he came to get us. so while we waited for him we walk to the board walk, went on some rides, took pics in the photo booth, got funnel cake and lots of soda. at 11pm her dad called and found the car. we drove back in his car and he took Michelle's. i was supposed to be home by 12, but we didnt get back to Nutely until 12:30 and i still had to dive 30min back to Rockaway, so instead got home at 1. 

next time kyle and i get bored and decide to go on a road trip, we should do it a little earlier. and lets try driving a car that actually works.

haha anyway we had an awesome night filled with adventure. good times!"

this was one of the best weekeneds ever, i had so much fun with all my friends and mark. i <3 you guys! i want to do it again, but maybe next time i wont feel so sick and i'll be able to enjoy the weekend even more.

But i am really excited about prom in general.  i just wish everything i have  to do was done with so i can relax.  it's  gonna be so much fun though. we are going to Hershey Park the day after and then camping...haha us camping, it's our first time."

then nicole took me home and i called mark and told him that i got a bouncing souls tatoo...even though i didn't. i just thought it would be funny to see what he'd say. so he totally believed me and nicole and i had a good laugh. but then i told him the truth.

friday night = back to the cafe for the alexisonfire show, the first few bands sucked, and the crowd was filled with a bunch of lame 14 year olds who were making out the whole show. but alexisonfire were awesome. i lost my shoe in the pit again, even though i tied them tighter, but i found it shortly after. and i saw lauren who i haven't seen in a year, so it was great to see her. shes still loud, crazy, and cute, just the way i left her and they way i like her to stay.

so nicole and i left here at 2 thinking we can get there early, go eat, and find parking. so we got there at like 3:30 and the doors opened at five. so we drove past the place and there was already a line. people had blankets and shit it was so cold. but we didn't want to stand outside for 3 hours so we looked for a place to eat. now we're in Asbury so everything is closed down, but we found this pizza place that had mad good pizza. so after we ate we headed back to the show and after 10 min. of trying to park, and an hour of standing outside freezing our asses off we finally got in the doors. 

so we went upstairs to check out the acoustic stage and look at look at some murch. but we saw the crowd getting pretty thick downstairs so we headed down to see who was going on. A Static Lullaby was first, there fucking awesome. nicole, jack and i we're kinda on the outskirts trying to get in. so this little teenie bopper pushed me and i went crazy and i pushed her and everyone around me out of the way so nicole and jack could get through as well. then Underoath went on...holy shit their fuckin sick. they were better than last time. the crowd went insane and it was amazing. my belt buckle broke off, i couldn't breath, and these stupid little girls were all over. so i just started spinning and pushing people and i cleared a pit. it was so sick. after Underoath it was killswitch, im not a big fan of them so nicole and i went to get some murch. when we got back Sensed fail went on so we dropped our stuff off with jack cause he wasn't goin in and nicole and i pushed our way in. we got completely separated and i ended up in the middle and were i went funckin insane. i started a mini pit that just got bigger and crazier, it was awesome. after they were done we found a seat at the top of the place cause My Chemical Romance came on and i could care less about them. they were really bad every song sounded the same and they were so full of themselves. though i must say sitting all the way up there u really get a great view of the crowd, it actually reminded me of a cult, with synchronized hand movements and singing. then the Used came on and they started palyin all their new stuff so we bounced. 
then when we got back we all went to the diner and met up with a bunch of people. we were really loud and disruptive but they didn't really care. 

now my whole body hurts, i have no voice, and im mad tired, but holy shit it was worth it. i wish i could do that every day."

but we had an awesome night so the pain today was totally worth it.

so tonight i got a call from my good friend bryan. he was in the area and decided to stop by before he goes back to school. 

-we talk about the good old days when there were awesome shows, and everyone were still friends. when we didn't have our licenses yet, and we would make a hole day out of walking to let it rock, in montclair, to by records. shows at the wayne fire house and taking the bus to the city any time we wanted.  

-when JC was still in jersey and
-when trevor had the purple van 
-before ""the boys"" went to college 
-hangin with morgin, rose and lauren everyday
-chillin at the lope lounge (aka bryan's basement)
-before the ""Bread incident"" the few of u know what im talking about 
-hangin with amelia...i wonder what happened to her, i miss her a lot.
-when good bands were still around like...STICK FIGURE SUICIDE, THE DARMA BOYS, S.O.I.P, SHADY VIEW TERRACE, PENCEY PREP, BIG WIG, STILLWELLE, FACE FIRST, THE RUSE*, RED ROVER, WORTHLESS UNITED, and LANEMYER........i can go on and on. 

 yeahh it was great. hangin with the crew through good times and bad through all the drama and breakups. good friends, good shows, good times, what more can i say."

"event","so for some reason these past few day i have been so irritated by pretty much everyone and i don't know why. its like i look around me and there is few people that don't piss me off. it's not my fault almost everyone in my school is an idiot. i try not to pay any attention to them but its so hard when ur always surrounded by stupid people. (ps. this is not about anyone in perticulare...just about people in general.) so if i've been a bitch to any of my friends these past few days, i'm sorry, it's not u, i've just realized how many stupid people there are in this world and it makes me sick. 

so this weekend i pretty much isolated myself, with the exception of sunday night . i just felt completely unmotivated to leave my room, and spent most of my weekend in bed. but what i did find interesting, is that throughout my isolation i found myself becoming more creative and i had a flow of inspiration. i completed several of my art projects and they came out fabulously. i think i get more work done when i block out the world. 

so although i've been in a bad mood lately and have been completely irritated all weekend, i feel extremely accomplished in my art work. so i guess i did get something good out of this weekend."

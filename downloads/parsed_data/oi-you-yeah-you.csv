I had a MUSC mag(the student council magazine) meeting and we learnt that the the student council are in a bit of a financial pickle at the moment and so as part of their cost cutting plan, they've cut all funding to the magazine. This is because the funding to the student has also been cut by the university... and THIS is because VSU makes it frightfully easy for students to NOT pay membership fees and so the student council is focussing on member recruitment and providing services for students rather than the student magazine.
THUS the student magazine will have to be funded trhough local businesses and advertising.
ALSO, sort of because of this, our editor Sai-Chung is resigning. He's going to run for councillor of macquarie uni student council which is excellent. His focus is now on student welfare etc.


SO... seeing as I'm the member recruitment officer, I have more work cut out for me. We've decided for this semester we will regularly update our website and have an online publication which will build up and be released in print for semester one next year. Thus we will ahve a big fat juicy magazine for all the first year students. This gives us plenty of time to build up finances and material for the next publication. 

But this means I need to find and form a web design and maintenance team and people who will call up and pester businesses to buy advertising spaces.
AND I still want to get in touch with witty art fart types for cartoons and comics. All the while constantly look for contributors. THIS IS CRAZY. Because I don't know anyone at uni. Like wtf?
I got this job just because I posted on the macquarie lj community. I'm not going to give it up because it will look good on resumes but what on earth am i meant to do? I don't converse with anyone from the IT faculties, I most certainly dont know any witty types haha. 

and this guy, our promotion/marketing manager Vince shits me. He's always stating the obvious like.. we need the website up and running before we promote it.
WELL THANKS CAPTAIN OBVIOUS.
I think he's just cut cos we can't publish any of his movie reviews which will probably be crap anyway because he reviews shit everyone watches like Pirates of the carribean and click and superman."

05:42pm 19/10/2002 
  Ok, this is the first of what seems to be a long record of things related to me and my so called life. Today is Saturday and I'm wondering why I'm still at home doing nothing.. well.. I guess I could've gone to the shopping centre... ok.. or not. Great, my weekend consists of doing nothing and sitting hopelessly at home. wow.. I have such a life... ok, thing's I've done today.. err.. wrote a few poems, destroyed the front yard in some lame attempt at gardening and uh.. that't it.. yep. my unproductive life yet again produced an unproductive day. Well, mum's never gonna let me near the garden now. 
ok..well.. oooh, my friend just msged me.. she's back and I'm now going to go over to her house.. bye.

It's been such a long time since I've been out. Like, I was kept indoors with uni exams and essays, during which I had no money cos I didn't work. So i worked a little, and now my mum's over in indonesia and I have to stay and be mum. So it was great to cut loose for one night. But alas, I need to keep working cos I've pretty much used all the money i had hahaha. Oh well!

"event","I bought a black vintage style net veil hat the other day.. I wish I didnt :( Well, I'm glad I did, but at the same time, there goes more money on something that I dont think I'll end up using often. I was going to wear it to the Monster Ball next weekend, but realised that it's probably going to annoy me the whole night, wearing a hat indoors and everything. I'm not used to hats. I wished I just stuck with the hair extension, I know I'll wear it more than one time. *sigh* and I've already used up all my money.. AGAIN. I worked a whole day, but then the next day i paid lauren back, pitched in some money for arpana's present, bought the hat and today I bought boots (the left one annoyingly gives me blisters. The right one is comfy) and I saw some pseudo psycho goth chick buy the platform heels which I wanted. I mean, far fuckin out. They were MINE. The lady who sold me the boots wasn't very helpful, totally was not interested in whether the boots fit properly or not. My calf muscles are too big.
talking about too big, some large greasy man sat next to me on the train and tried to strike a conversation. I answered politely I think I asked one or two questions, but his voice was that of a 12 year old and he wasn't sitting very nicely and so I was practically cowering in the corner. 
I'm so bad with money.
I should just not have any.
no, that would hurt so much.
Mags and I went to hungry jacks. I had a greasy burger, she had a greasy sundae, we laughed at people like the group of people sitting on our right side. Two men eating with four asian ladies. asian fetish much? People with asian fetishes creep me out like mustafa's friend mr J and numerous strangers trying to add me as a friend. Man, I wish I had a bunch of asian hoes clinging on to me for australian citizenship. I'd be da man."

"event","I'm going to dye my hair again soon, I'm tired of these two plain streaks. I was going to get my fringe bleached blonde too, but regrwoth is far too noticeable and it means I can't put my hair up because the rewgrowth is so obvious. And I cannot be bothered going back to the hairdressers and re-bleaching it because it can never get light enough and it kills hair even more so.
So I'm going to get all but the fringe and side front bits dyed a wine red. Since my regrowth is black, it won't make so much of a difference. The main reason why I want to do this is because sort of bleaching my hair (so the red will show) will make my hair so much more manageable in its current length because it will be a little more dry. But not so much like my platinum blonde streaks. AND I'll be able to do rolls more often because firstly it will be more manageable, but secondly, it will look better because rolls always look nicer in non black hair or two tone hair... like psychoshugrr's (hahaha yes, I LOVE your hair rolls, the two tone works so great!).
I've decided to keep my fringe black because pomping it and curling it already dries it out massively. Plus it'll give rolls that extra colour. So yeah, the only reason why I'm even considerig dying about 4/5 of my head is because my hair is too short and I think this is only way I'll get to do anything with it at this length.
What do you guys reckon?

enough about that. I'm going to use my myspace blog more often... but I really don't know what to put in there. Most of the stuff I want to say I say in livejournal. I'm not going to give up livejournal. I still want to get a paid account. Talking about online community type things, I've got so many of them! apart from my livejournal and myspace, I am on:
darkstarlings.com
zorpia.com
bingbox.com
wayn.com
xanga.com
I think I've also go a greatestjournal and a deadjournal... lol.

I don't actually go on any of them except darkstarlings (I use the forums there, it's the only way I get to exercise my music history knowledge). But seriously, it's full of 13 and 14 year old 'goths'"

IT'S A DAY BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY.
So this is what i have planned
sept. 1- shopping + party
sept. 2- wasted festival
sept. 3- go home for birthday bbq.

And since it is in september, I will save up to the best of my ability so I can splurge in melbourne. yessss.
This will require RIGOROUS SELF CONTROL. I think i can i think i can i think i can.

yah, wasted is gonna be fun because I had fun at fowl air and it's pretty much fowl air but without dayglo abortions.
they will have the angelic upstarts though. YES TOKEN FOREIGN OLD MEN. lol. 

aaahh memories of fowl air just flooded back *sigh*. Running around the only 16 year old inside because nigel was my guardian (well, except for mags, but then again, she was her sister lol) and further running around with mags and all the sleaze that came with it, like the dayglo abortions singer using us as crutches down the stairs. totally not realising that I had been talking to Deano from vicious until he jumped on stage. fucking crazy madman at toukley caravan park who would randomly collapse onto the footpath praying to the aboriginal Jesus. Realising how pathetic Greg was. Minding a dog in the car park outside in the freezing weather. ""scars... penruf...anarchoi... it's fuckin shithouse.. feel like frowing a brick fru the window *points*"". moving through rooms in some abandoned house, finding a place to sleep, avoiding room that smelled like piss, and another full of broken glass. everyone being boring the next morning.

I think the funniest thing that happend which I will NEVER forget, it is just permantely seared into my memory, was when I was looking for a place to recharge my video camera batteries. I ended up charging it in the room dayglo abortions were in and the lead singer was tightly tucked up in bed, literally up to his neck, smiling sleazily at me. I went out and cracked up like I've never cracked up before. One other band member was there watching cricket on this tiny box with barely any reception. lol.

I guess I'm not too fussed about it.. I actually like exams. I work better under pressure.. my hsc was saved because I did well in my exams. And plus as far as i know, the exams are pretty straight forward, pretty much general theoretical knowledge and concepts which is easy to study for.
My last exam is on the 22nd... so i sort of get off early... so the end of june and the whole of july is all mine!! yes mine!!
I'll be busy doing stuff like... GAY CLUBBING. and then next semester i do that music course which I'm SO LOOKING FORWARD TOO. It's something that I'll put so much effort and determination into.
I'm really worried that I won't be able to get into the course I want to next year. I just need a pass (I'm seriously not looking for an honours, would prefer not to end up at uni 10 years after I get my BA). To be honest, if i do pass, I reckon I'd just scrape in. The main reason behind me being shit at uni is because I'm a fucking terrible procrastinator, always handing things in late... not wanting to stay up late to finish assignments.. that kind of shit. I swear I'll be better next semester.. oh and I've put up my hand to be part of the student council mag editorial team. I decided to join cos it's new, so I there's no red tape... and...

I'm sorry to bore everyone with details of my boring uni life, which I understand the inclusion of the macquarie uni magazine does not make much more exciting.
Well... the other day a guy came around to fix our hot water system because it carked it  and he saw me (only for a fleeting moment though) in my bra.  I was getting dressed that morning and I had just put on my jeans to look up and see the guy looking back. He was turning off the house's water at the main which happens to be on the side of our house in front of my window. I freaked out and covered myself (with a fucking bandana.. the closest thing i could grab) and ducked so fast i hit my knee on the bottom drawer which was open. so now I have this huge bruse on the side of my knee. This isn't exciting.. just embarrassing but there you have it.

oh and I bought like 4 ringtones the other day. The ones provided by vodafone suck, but the partner sites are good... i got reel big fish- take on me, slinkee minx- summer rain, pet shop boys- always on my mind, queen- crazy little thing called love. Oh, and I've reached the final stage of the final level of this mobile game called Diner Dash. I have a feeling I won't get it... IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. But if I do finish it.. it'll be the 2nd mobile game I've finished completely.. ha.. I'm pathetic."

It's true.

Especially now cos the farewell party was last night.
I had a good time.
But that doesn't mean Alyce is going to stay in australia. I'm going to miss her so much. You might not know why.. you might not know her.. but imagine waking up to find that you have no limbs.. THAT'S HOW I'M GOING TO FEEL.
Ok, perhaps not all your limbs. Just your favourite limb.. or organ. You'd just feel so...

incomplete.

Temt in roselands is closing down which bites cos I actually liked that store. I've picked up some neat things from there. But the huge closing down sale made up for it. I scored a James Dean jacket (it's red and tuff) and some other stuff."

Instead of going out to see Vessel of Sin and the nervous wreckers play, I went and had tenpenyaki with Lauren and Mustafa. It was fun but our chef wasn't sober so he was moody and had no aim. We decided the next time we go eat out, we're going to go to a German restaurant. My hair is too short!! I haaate it. It's too long to put it up, it's to short to curl or do anything fun with it."

"event","I got my hair cut today.. I don't like it :(
Well, it's ok, but I know I'm going to wish it was long and mane-like again.
It's like a bob with longer parts in the front... 
The hairdresser lady couldn't speak english or I couldn't speak non-english. I told her AND her boss michael what I wanted. He seemed to understand but what did the lady do? she cut my hair straight all the way around, I had to stop her and tell her AGAIN that i wanted it longer in the front and she told me some technical word for the style and I didn't even get it. So she cut the back shorter.. so now I have a bob. How the fuck are normal people supposed to know the technical name for a hairstyle.. hairdressers should be able to do a hairstyle with a description from the customer. And hell, I know what a bob is... if i wanted a bob I'd ask for one.. but I didn't cos that's not what I wanted.
So yeah.. my hair is short now. grrr. Luckily hair grows back.

I've been naughty again. I missed out on ANOTHER media studies tutorial.. i think this is my third :( I was meant to spend my three hour break with mustafa but to make a long story short I left my wallet at home and I had to go back, we were impatient and went on the train (bad idea) where we were faced with more problems and by the time I got to uni it was already 4 (yes i was an HOUR late) and we went to the movies which went to 7pm... halfway through my english lectures.

But it wasn't so bad.. we watched V is for Vendetta and maaan that's one of the best movies I've seen in ages! I really really enjoyed it.. I'd even consider it as one of my favourite movies of all time. I didn't find a single thing cheesy with it, I liked how all the clues that were slowly revealed throughout the movie actually all tied up in the end, talking about the end, it was really satisfying and cathartic. Throughout the film my skin was all tingly and i had chills up and down my spine (mainly due to the fact that I REALLY needed to go to the toilet, I held back for the whole movie.. it was THAT GOOD).
But it might just be me (although mustafa also loved it), cos I'm a nutter for utopian/dystopian fims and books. It was so obviously '1984', it even echoed a degree of Bladerunner... but that's why i enjoyed it. I think it had a nice balance of socio-politics and personal drama, neither aspect overpowered or cheapened each other. I think the board of studies should scrap bladerunner and adopt this in the syllabus.

I highly recommend everyone watch V is for Vendetta."

Yesterday before uni mags and I hung in the city like the uni wanks we are. She took me to shibuyu and maaaan americans whinge about shops like hot topic commercialising and trivialising punk or whatever with their over-priced ""punque roc"" clothes...the japanese are WAAAYYY ahead of them.
Today there were some stalls for SAM week. I bought this excellent old school tattoo print bag. Mum's gonna spew haha.
I also bought 3 cds, the jam, l7 and... ABBA SUPER TROUPER. Now my abba cd collection is pretty much complete. I have pretty much all their releases, except singles and all the best ofs. I only own one.. abba gold.
I've spent practically $150 already today.
I also bought a hair straightener which came with a free curling tong.

I really should stop spending money...


<small>but there's this mobile phone I want to buy.. and those shoes from rabans... and that hello kitty doll and top from Shibuyu and..............."

"event","shot with desire is the talk of ol sydney town. It was my incentive to lose weight, but since that's not happening I guess shot with desire isn't either. But I've been thinking about it a lot lately. I just dont think I'm underground enough. I mean it's not underground erotica for nothing. Maybe if I went with mags, that'd be awesome. But she can't cos murray says so... ugh. And I've started my waist binding (finally!). 
There are these seriously cute shoes at Rabens. I'd even wear them to uni cos they're SO comfy! Only one problem... my mum'd kill me if I bought another pair of ""outrageous"" shoes.. especially ones from Rabens. Practically all my shoes are from there, the man knows me, and he knows my feet. I went to try on these shoes and he said ""these are very generous in the front"" and asked me to try on all the styles of shoes to see how they fitted. THe ones I'm in love with have the mary jane straps and so they were good but the others were the right width but were too long and he was examining them and told me they were still ""under construction"". Maybe they're a special line of shoes for 

people with wide feet... like me :D if so that would be awesome.

I don't care. I must have those shoes!!!
I think I'll get them first day back to uni.. eeeeee!"

I really hope I get to hang with my cousin lisa soon. I dig our shopping trips together and god knows I need to go shopping soon! Sunday night I visited her and I totally dig our conversations. I also ended up doing her eyebrows :S I was so paranoid that I'd do something wrong cos I've never done someone else's eyebrows. They turned out fine I guess, well, better than what she had before, but still. My nerves were getting to me.. I was worried like hell. 
I wish she didn't live so far away. She's one of my favourite people in the world and I don't see her as often as I'd like to. She's the kind of girl I can talk about dieting and waist training and vanity and just seriously all out anti feminist bullshit without feeling like a wanker.
Her waist is now 60cm! Her goal is 55.. only 5cms to go!.. but the problem is her hips are still practically non existent. But her waist now requires her to wear clothes with really tapered waistlines. Man if only I could have a 60cm waistline.. things would be so swell.

to make a long story short:

stephanie can't manage her time properly. is impatient with buses. did a whole lot of unnecessary walking. found out all her cards, money and everything else she needs to get around sydney is back home. more ridiculous walking in hot hot heat. got home. missed out on media studies tutorial. wasted more time not doing assignments. ended up going to uni anyway.

It's my 5th week of uni and I'm still waiting for that outburst of dilligence and industriousness. But alas, I don't think I'm going to have one.
I'm already behind my readings, I do rush job essays and assignments, I've even already 'jigged' my english lectures (it feels shit saying 'i jigged my english lecture').
I sat on the hill and talked to Rob about shit then we went to the library and watched some dodgy 80s hip hop film called 'Wild Style'. It was actually a really bludgey day cos I had cultural studies tutorial and they had presentations. SO i just sat there with meredith, making fun of the presenters and some guy in our class we have dubbed girl pants pete.
So yeah, fuck.
On an equally depressing note...
Mum took away my Age of The Empires and Dawn of the Empire CDs :(
I mean, yeah, ok they distract me but farout. She always does that with my stuff.
I guess it doesn't really matter... I'm going to blow a lot of money on a new edition of age of the empires anyway.
Plus, I play rollercoaster tycoon more than my nerdy ancient civilisation games.
AND I've got age of the empires 2 on my mobile. It's not as good but who cares.
Same with The settlers. Pretty shit game but oh well.
I mean it's not like I'm on the computer all the time... not even close. I spend much more time cat napping and other destructive methods of procrastination.

Shoreshocked this weekend.. unless I'm forced to take my little brother to the cinemas to watch ice age 2.
and then hopefully sunday I'll go see the nervous wreckers with jack nasty face and richi and the creeps. Fun times.
I bought legally blonde for $2.. I haven't finished watching it.

"event","I have so much to tell too!
Namely it was punx picnic a couple of weeks ago it was awesome i have lots of photos and I've started uni.
It's actually my 2nd week already and oh man the work is already starting to pile up.
I have 2 essays and a presentation all due in a few weeks.
I've met a lot of people, but I'm terrible with names. But I've remembered a handful which is a good sign. There is this girl Kate who lives somewhere I've never heard, but she's awesome, even if she listens to marilyn manson lol. She wears a lot of black too. But it's not stupid goth space boots and chains and fluro mesh kind of thing.
Then there's meredith who i'm trying to figure out. She's like a hippie pagan tree of life type of person lol. She never takes any notes down at lectures, she just draws fairies and flowers and girls with swirly hair flying all over. She also doesn't make much conversation. 
Then there's kirsten who i have to do the presentation with. She's nice, even if she's a bit domineering. I met her during academic orientation and i see her all the time during lectures and shes in one of my tutorials. other than that i dont remember the others.
I did meet kathryn today.. SHE'S JUST LIKE MAGS BUT TRENDY. like myspace and livejournal rating community trendy. It's kinda cool. Talking about myspace, I had my first cultural studies tutorial today and we have a dumb airhead called Paris. Yeah how gay. The way she talks, the way she laughs and asks questions is ridiculous to the extreme. The way we make fun of ditzy air heads, the way we imitate them (as in over exaggeration) is how she normally. IT'S SO CRAZY. I was just sitting there thinking OH MY GOD.. THEY DO EXIST.
Anyway as part of the introductory thing we had to tell everyone our name, the degree we're doing and somehting we're obsessed about. Everyone said dumb things like reading and writing, and shopping and music and sleep and blah blah. I said ROLLERCOASTER TYCOON 3!! only one person knew what it was.. everyone else looked confused... but Paris said ""MYSPACE!!"" and everyone.. i mean EVERYONE was silent as if in disbelief and then laughed a quick laugh and we moved on.
She was serious.

Anyway on my breaks pretty much all I do is sit on the many grassy hills listening to music.. doing nothing practically.
I haven't made use of the uni bar due to lack of company. I'd make use of it, but I'm afraid drinking alone will result in alcoholism.


Tomorrow I'm going to do some serious shopping with alyce!! I love that girl so much. I'm gonna miss her a lot when she goes to england and be all successful and important.
And she's been stressing out and I've been stressing out too so a day of reveling in mindless capitalistic consumption.. and brunch. eexxcellent.

So I bought relatively safe books.
One contains all of Jane Austen's novels and the other, and oscar wilde- picture of dorian gray.
But the jane austen one doesn't have any footnotes or analysis notes or anything which I actually enjoy when it comes to a book. I'm sort of regretting going for a cheaper alternative and not having notes.

and its really hard to read pride and prejudice after watching the bbc mini series because you realise how many sentences have been cut and the subtle differences. Sometimes they can make you happy like you appreciate how well the bbc production captured and/or enhanced an important part of the novel.. or it can leave a terrible sense of dissapointment as you find out that darcy doesn't emerge from a pond wearing a loose white shirt in the book. lol.

If im brave enough the next book I'll get is marquis de sade- philosophy at the boudoir.

Its just mum kept telling me I was doing it wrong and taking the shovel off me and doing it herself and then she'd whinge that she was doing all the work. I don't really care, she still did it. The flower bed is a bitch to work with though cos it's so full of clay. Luckily there's nicer soft clay at the bottom which won't kill my plants :) So we have a wheely bin about 3/4 full of hard clay. It's hard work clearing out that clay!
Also I kept stopping cos I was hurting too many worms.
I'm such an animal loving bastard that I tried to save all the worms. I was overcome with so much guilt that I stopped digging when I could have dug for a few more hours.
Yes, I've been digging for a few hours for the past few days, well, I put it as 3 full length albums. I play my music from my room very loud as to hear it from where I'm working. I put it to just over an hour each album.
Today when I started to dig again, i found some dead worms which I tried to save but they didn't make it, as in they were cut in the spot that doesn't grow back. I did see one which was healing though. It's really wierd cos there's like this huge round growth on one end of the worm. However today I saved some (4 i think) really big ones and put them in another flower bed.
I think I'm going to buy some worms from the nursery and put them in my new garden anyway.
Worms are so awesome.
I hate hurting them and cutting them in half cos they're completely defenceless and they only do good and not evil to gardens. I can get over hurting snails and slugs, and moth caterpillars. But not worms. They're awesome and I want lots of earthworms in my garden.
So far we've moved the huge trumpet lilly type plants to the side. I've dug out a deepish trench which an average sized person can fit in. We've bought 6 plants, 3 gardenias and 3 biblical jasmines.. I plan on getting some fresia bulbs in a few months. 
hahaha yes.. my little garden is going to be very very very smelly. Pleasantly smelly though. I do believe the word is fragrant. But y'know. I'm not much cultured or sophisticated so who cares.
We have this huge gardenia bush thing just outside our dining area and spring and summer nights are beautiful cos we open the window and the room smells like gardenias <3
It's also going to be a very white garden. Until my fresias are in, then hopefully it'll have some colour.Fresias are my favourite flower, and I can't wait. I want to put a little walk way seperating the trumpet lillies from the other plants, the little path will lead to the wall, but I think it'll look nice.
I just hope I get to do the planting and not mum.
Because it's MY garden.
So far I've spent aroudn $150 on the garden and I still ahve to buy:
mulch 
perhaps mondo grass. 
And I want to change the garden border. But i dunno what I want yet. 
My Fresia bulbs Which I'll plant around June
Lots of lovely earthworms.
Perhaps more biblical jasmines.


I love nice smelling plants.
I also went shopping and bought makeup. Tra la la!

thee end."

It was Jaime's 18th the other night and it was a pimps and hoes kind of like theme. I dressed up like a skanky hoe. Not only did I enjoy it thoroughly but for some reason it comes naturally lol.
I met mark and margo/craig. They were nice.
Jaime's little brother mitchell is incredibly smart for a 2 year old.
I wish we hit the shots a bit earlier. I had my own smirnoff ices.
I now have a new set of shot glasses. excellent.

I get to enrol at uni today >.< it's daunting. 
So far, if all goes to plan, I will be going to uni tuesday, wednesday and Friday and I'll have monday and thursday free. weeeeee.
I'd hate to have to go all the way to uni for one lesson or tutorial.
That would suck a lot.

Will be seeing cassanova and jarhead soon. Jarhead, mainly to perve. Can't wait till Cars opens in cinemas here. People are still talking about brokeback mountain.


Dieting is really not working out. Mainly cos I'm still eating bad things though I've cut down to one mini pizza at work. My cousin is going to make me an asian corset kind of thing. You wrap it around your waist tightly and wear it during sleep. she dropped from 77 to 63cm round the waist.Well.. Here goes nothing!
I love my cousin cos I can talk about weird cliched girly stuff without feeling embarrassed like how we want pinched waistlines, even though we know it's not gonna happen lol.

Pictures from Jaime's party are awesome.
Will post soon.
Will be having a monty python picnic cos I have a mondo swanky new picnic set. John Cleese look alike competition too. I'm going to win.
I wish i was julia zemiro.
Sting- Bring on the night is the worst song ever.

"event","Figuring out my program for uni is stressful cos i keep forgetting what the codes mean and have to look them up over and over again. I know how to put my timetable together, but its fitting what I want in that's a problem. I'm confused because I've ended up choosing units/subjects from faculties all over the place. I've even put down a unit from the department of music cos well, I almost internally combusted when I red the unit description:
""this unit will look at the social and cultural connections between various articulations of popular passions and/or socio-political rebelliousness and the style, identity and marketing of popular culture""

I know. Perfect.

All I really know is I want to do a 2nd year unit called Graffiti Kitsch and Trash: Crimes of style.

""THis topic will theorise key topics such as subcultures and oppositioal cultures, identiy politics and the politics of style, the politics of high, popular and low culture, cultural identities in global/local contexts""

As much as I enjoyed Ancient history at highschool, and as much as I did well in it, I'm glad I'm not doing it or I'd be doing units like 

""Democracy and Empire: Athens 632-399BC""
and
""From Ur to Babylon: A history of Israel from Abraham to the Babylonian exile""

and I can learn cool languages like latin, ancient greek, classical hebrew, egyptian heiroglyphs and coptic. Be still my beating heart.

But y'know... if you were a particularly daring thrill seeker you'd probably go do law and study The Australian Journal of Legal History, or do some exciting stuff with statistics in ""Statistical data management and analysis"".

But y'know, I think it would be cool to teach ancient history at school. That would be awesome.
So if nothing pans out with this degree.. I know what I'd like to have a go at.


... hormone. hehehe."

oh and.. <b>Happy chinese/lunar new year to everyone!! Gong xi fat chai!!</b>
I got $70 this year. Pretty dissapointing but meh.
Chinese new year was spent with lauren first at china town where we bought fans, she bought a mini screen and we stuffed our faces with chinese food. Then we went to zgt show which was the best zgt show I've been too I think. Vessel of sin were also really good. We met this girl hayley, the ex girlfriend of vessel of sin's double bassist. She was funny. Saw a cute guy but was too chicken shit to do anything about it. Wore my cool shoes and met Rosie *chi ching!*
Saw Brokeback mountain with mushy today and bought a little shrug jacket thing thats red with black polka dots.. lovelove.

I'm going to buy rollercoaster tycoon gold soon.
Also tamagotchi, zoo tycoon2, age of the empires 2 and solitaire on my phone.
I swear I could have just exploded when I found out I could have age of empires 2 on my phone.
I'm a fucking nerd. I like computer strategy games based on ancient civilisations. I'm not a big fan of modern wars though like world war 1 and 2. Recently I've been playing a lot of the Settlers3, which is like a $10 game. It's not very good but for some reason I really enjoy it. Probably cos you have to build up the economy and I love doing that. Not as much as the fighting I suppose.
Also.. once I have $450 lying about.. I'm going to buy myself a samurai helmet. And if I save up more, I'm going to buy the whole samurai suit. They also had medievil infantry helmets, chain mail suits and everything in some military/gun store in the city.
I will have the ultimate dress up box.
I want to try out for shotwithdesire.com. It will be my incentive to lose weight.
Yay, motivation :)"

It's of him beaming at his first car. It was cute :) And he's not that red. Crazy camera phones.
We went to menai today. To go bloody swimming in some river. haha. I enjoyed it, but it was completely out of my comfort zone and couldn't help but feel like.. a fish out of water.. so to speak. but the other way around... I grazed my knees on rocks. And his car decided to make unhealthy sounds which got him really paranoid and so we stopped on the side of the road for about an hour while he tried to fix it haha and he was paranoid and unhappy all the way home.
oh well. it was better than the beach though.
just about everything is haha.
I bought toby a stick with feathers on the end. He loves it. Loves it so much, I have to buy a new one cos all the feathers have dissapeared haha.
vintage_dolls is a pretty lame rating community. Its too easy to get into (just look at about 3/4s of the accepted people) and is pretty much now promotions community. bahaha.

We watched saw 2 and it is so frustrating. Good, but frustrating. And the thing that scared us the most was not a gorey slasher scene thing. it was when the lady got thrown into a pit full of feral heroin needles. It was your pretty average slasher film. The twist at the end didn't make much sense.. I know it's been a while, but to put it simply my myspace marital status is now in a relationship hahaha.
Who is this eddy? Well, if you are familiar with my psycho_a_go_go account, you would have heard me ramble a fair bit about him. Actually, he is the topic of many lj posts.. along with a number of other boys.. aren't they always lol.


<lj-cut text=""blah blah eddy blah blah"">
At first it was really weird being with him. I'm happy, but couldn't help but feel everything was a tad surreal. Because I have known him for 2 years now, he's a boy from school and we came from totally completely different social groups. Not to mention he was a crush. Actually getting into a relationship with a crush is something I've never done... never thought I'd actually do. It was so out of the question for me. But look at us now. I don't want to get into too much detail about my inner battle between my insecurities and my happiness. That'll come progressively hahaha. Taste the anticipation.

But I've met his best friend Cameron and Cameron's girlfriend Alyce (not my other friend alyce). Cameron is one fucking pro shoplifter, he's skinny and looks like Seth from the OC. You can tell that eddy and cameron are best mates... they talk like each other. Alyce was awesome though, and we found a lot of shit to talk about. It felt sucky though cos while our boyfriends went to pick up a movie in eddy's ute, I stayed at home helping alyce fold stuff for cameron to pack in his suitcase for his trip the next day. I felt very domestic. It's a terrible feeling considering I haven't even been with him for a month.

</lj-cut>
Other than that... I have a new phone!! Its radder than yours cos it has The Sims 2 on it. It's like a really advanced Tamagotchi. Fucking brilliant. I had a cat tamagotchi like thing on my old phone, but you couldn't make it dance, or sleep or flirt, tell dirty jokes, get married and become a guitarist. This is much more fun and is the cause of much sleep deprivation. I wished I saved up a little more and bought one with a better camera. Oh well.
Maybe later.
I really need to get organised about uni. I decided I'm going to put Macquarie as my first preference and then just transfer at the end of the year. They're really similar courses.. although i think perhaps the one at macquarie uni is better. But geographically, Macquarie is so out of the way for me. We'll just have to see how I cope travelling to North Sydney everyday.
And y'know whats fun? Age of the Empires. I've always like strategy computer games but for some reason I'm getting tied up with my brothers recent obsession with ancient civilisations and warfare. I gravitate towards anything which talks about ancient history, but warfare is pretty boring... but not when you get to control it muahahahaa."

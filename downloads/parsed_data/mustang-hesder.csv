"event","I know it took a while.  We actually started the diet yesterday but did not weigh in until this morning because we did not yet have a scale.  Offically this morning my weight was 304.5lb and my BMI 42.5%, which means I have a ways to go.  Hopefully I can stick with it this time.  It is much easier with my roommates doing it as well and it was easier in general the second time around.  I think I really want to do it, I just need support.  We'll see.  Hopefully I'll be able to get on a schedule too.  I couldn't drag myself out of bed this morning because I didnt have anywhere that I had to be.  The idea was to get up early even on the days I have off so getting up for my 8:30 am wasn't as hard.  We'll work on it though."

"event","Well, here we go again.  Gave up on the diet thing about a month after I had started it.  Showed it to my roommates this year, and Matt was all like let's totally do this!  So now I won't be alone this time.  We start tomorrow, the most dreaded phase...phase I.  No meat.  No pasta.  No bread.  Bah!  But, it's necessary.  I need to do something and now I have the support group that I need too.  I think Baylee is going to do it with us too.  

Goals:
To loose at least 64 pounds by graduation
To actually stick to the diet this time
To improve my overall physically fitness with exerceise
Wake up at 7am every day to get myself on a regular schedule
Keep up with all my studies, regionals, and bridge

So wish me luck.  I'll post tomorrow offical my offical weigh in."

"event","So, it's a wonderful and beautiful day in the neighborhood of Village Green Apartments so I decided to go for a bike ride.  I haven't rode my bike for like two weeks because of the testing of gravity and inertia incident involving myself, my bike, my front brakes, and mud.  Today I was all excited and was riding my bike down the side walk on my way to Mall Dr. when I had to make a turn, so I needed to slow down.  Like the moron I am I squeezed the front brake again, although this time my brain was not surprised and I didn't eat the sidewalk, I caught myself instead and ended up on my feet with my bike in the mud.  I twisted my wrist though a little so it's a little sore again.  Now why did I not learn the first time?  I didn't do it again throughout my ride, and I've even conisdered disconnecting the front brake for now.  It's especially bad because my old bike has like zero brakes so I don't just squeeze them lightly.  I squeeze them really hard because I'm afraid I won't stop.  AH!  I guess it's gonna be a slow learning process for the Hesder.

In other news, I weighed myself again and I am down to 285.6, a weight loss of 21.8lbs!  My jeans are not tight anymore, I don't have to go shopping for something nice to wear for the banquet at Tech because my fabulous red shirt fits me nicely now!  I probably won't have to go shopping for clothes for the summer, maybe some pants, because all of my dress shirts should fit me again by then!  At the end of the summer, I should be back into a size 20 jean!  I will be so excited.  I feel so much better.  I'm glad that I made the decision to get healthy.

In bridge news, I'm ready to kick Michigan and LTU's butts!"

That's a total loss of 17.8 pounds and a BMI I drop of 2.5 :)  Yesterday I wore a pair of jeans that I haven't wore in about 4 months :)  I do need to start exercising again.  I think it would help releave some of the stress I'm under and maybe even give me some more energy--which would be extremely appreciated.  It might have to wait one more week though because of all I have going on right now.  I do need to do something to fix my sleeping pattern and give me more energy though.  Just like last year I'm not sleeping well because of this bridge thing.  My brain is all ""who's gonna do this?"" ""We should do that"" ""what if this"" and I can't even stab it with a q-tip to make it stop =/
The bridge isn't done yet.  We WILL load test Monday if I have to live in the shop this week.  So if you don't see me/hear from me the rest of the week, you'll be able to find me out there for sure!"

Ok so this is why my life sucks right now.  Reason 1) at least $1000 from the bridge team has turned up missing.  Tom can't find it in the ASCE account and it's not in our SB account.  Reason 2) Regionals this year is going to cost us about $4000 to go to.  It sucks.  I will cost us almost as much to go to nationals in California!  I hate Michigan Tech and their money gouging non-sponser finding ways!  Reason 3) Dr. Buch is nagging me not to take the whole team.  I think that they all should be able to go and they all will go, we just might have to do some fund raising if we don't have enough money.  We may have to write some people and get some donations.  We will find a way.  Reason 4) I'm behind in all my classes.  Reason 5) No one has volunteered for SET Day yet.  AHHHHHHHHHHH"

"event","Under motivated...that pretty much sums up like the last week of my life.  I made all these wonderful vows--exercise every day, go to every class, get all my homework done ahead of time, save the world, you know the usual.  Unfortunately it hasn't gone as planned and I have two tests Wednesday that I am not prepared for :(
In other news...I cheated on my diet this weekend :(  The first cheat wasn't so bad, I had a flat wrap sandwich with my family.  Not that bad.  Tacos--lots of cheese and sour cream, getting worse....then my brother was eating Reese's pieces and skittles and I had some...along with one of Ginger's licorice whips.  I need to be stronger when I am with my family :(  I also need to plan meals better that way if I am going to eat cheese, I only do it once (you can't have tacos without the cheese) and everyone was like you could have done this instead blah blah blah like this is an easy thing.  I feel like they were more destructive rather than constructive.  When Basil told my dad I cheated it almost sounded like he was proud.  Then they were like we're disappointed in you.  And I was thinking wtf?  You guys sit there and eat junk and I try to eat healthy and then you say you're disappointed when I vear?  How about ""It's okay, you should try not to do it again.""  or ""How about we have this next time instead""  or ""Why don't you plan the meals next weekend?""  It was frusterating.  I was already disappointed in myself for cheating and they didn't help at all.    I told them what I could eat and what I couldn't and they kept thinking the opposite of what I could eat was what I couldn't eat.  I brought the book home and Sheila even looked at it.  I don't know if I should have set them down and been like ""ok, read this list.  See that, that is what I can eat.  How about we plan our meals around that???""  but I don't know if that would have helped.  My dad kept saying things like ""just because she can't have it doesn't mean that I can't.""  I wish they were more supportive.  I wish that they had made me eat healthy as a child.  I wish that I hadn't waited so long to start eating better and exercising.  I know that this isn't their fault and that it is my responsibility to determine what is good for me and what I eat, but damn it they could be a little more helpful.  Ginger was about the only one who was all for it (minus the candy).  She liked the healthier stuff more than the not healthy stuff.  My dad is really negative too ""brown rice is nasty, I'm not eating it""  Evy was fairly supportive too.  I guess mostly I'm just frustrated. 
This weekend is my mom's birthday so I told her I'd cook dinner for her.  Mostly because then I could avoid an unhealthy situation (and seek a healthy revenge on Basil).  I also have to experiment and try to make an angel food cake from brown rice and splenda.  I hope it works out well.  I can't think of any other kind of cake that would work.  If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.
Sorry for the long venting, but I feel better now."

On breaking the patterns of your past on the relationships test:

"event","Well, I am happy to annouce that I made it through phase I completely, without cheating and 8.2lbs lighter.  I now weigh 299.2 lbs as of this morning.  The hardest part in this phase were the cravings for meat for the first couple of days.  I had a dream about chasing chickens even.  It was crazy. Towards the end it was alright.  I've learned proportions and the importance of eating throughout the day.  I no longer pile my plate with food and always try to eat at least half a plate of veggies at dinner now.  Instead of potato chips, I snack on fruit, veggies, or yogurt.  It's actually been a lot easier than I thought it would be, especailly with a roommate who does eat that stuff.  There has been a tin of cookies sitting on the table all week that Jaime's mom sent home with her and I just let them sit there.
I also learned that green tea is amazing.  I recommend Cranberry Palmagrante, Orange Passionfruit Jasime, or Berry.  My favorite is probably the Orange Passionfruit.  I always feel like such a goofball in the store when I get excited about a new flavor of green tea that I haven't tried yet.  Exercising has been tough, but I've been sticking to it.  I've been walking to the commuter lot or from the commuter lot a couple times a week and doing Pilates.  I actually own two pilates videos now.  
Phase II is supposed to last for three weeks, so Feburary 23rd I begin phase III.  I can now eat meat, and some cheese, and a bunch of other stuff.  I am also supposed to increase my exercise from 30 minutes 5 days a week to 35 minutes 5 days a week.  I think this is going to be the toughest part now, but I believe I can do this.  I will do this and I want to do this.  As long as I keep telling myself that, I think I'll be fine."

So day 2 went well, aside from the fact that I really wanted to eat meat but couldn't.  Then I feel absolutely great, which is kinda irriating because then it's like I can't justify cheating, but it's also a good thing because I can't justify cheating.  I've learned taco sauce is like cheese, it can make anything taste good.  I am still pretty energic and excited about the whole thing."

He says I'm not allowed to do a lot of things like eat cheese.  Curse Ian.  (just kidding, although cheese is one of the hard things to give up cuz everything taste good with enough cheese on it).  Once I figured out taco sauce was permitted and a couple table spoons of dressing (it was actually in one of the suggested recipies) everything was ok again.  I regret not eating the oatmeal for breakfast when I got up late.  I'll have to do that tomorrow.  The rice and beans are kinda bland and suck a little bit, but it's ok.  I walked back from the commuter lot today, it was apparently not as bad as I remember it.  In fact, it only took about five more minutes than the bus normally takes, so that was kinda cool.  I actually feel pretty good, wasn't really starved or anything all day.  I did take a nap, but it hasn't been determined whether or not that was due to a new eating habit or due to the fact that I was still sick.  I'll probably have a vitimin tomorrow too, just in case, though near as I can tell I'm not eliminating any food groups so there shouldn't be a problem.  Anyways, still happy I am doing this.  
And thanks for the link Mike.  The recipies there sound delcious from what I've looked at :)"

After soaking beans overnight, boil in a pot for 1 hour.  Meanwhile, cook 3 cups of rice as per directions on box.  Mix in frozen veggies after done.  In a separate pan, saute garlic and onion in olive oil, add egg whites and cook.  When done, mix into rice and veggie pan.  When beans are done mix those in as well.  Add pepper and Mrs. Dash to taste. 

Cheese in this would be good, but it's been banned."

"event","So I bought a book the other day after watching The Tyra Show.  It's called ""The Fat Smash Diet"" by Ian K. Smith, M.D. and near as I can tell it isn't a bad idea.  The craptacularist part is that I am supposed to not eat meat for 9 whole long days, but we'll give it a shot.  During ""Phase I"" you aren't supposed to eat a lot of things, but you are supposed to eat lots of fruits, veggies, beans, etc so all the food groups are still covered.  I think the most appealing part is there is no calarie counting.  The closest thing to counting is you have to count whether you have 1 glass of milk or 2.  I can handle that.  I guess this is the same guy who is the diet guy on Celebrity Fit Club.  So anyways, I'll give you updates and probably lots of whining about how I can't have this or that, but it sounds like it should really work.  
Anyways, tomorrow I start phase I: Detox stage  If anyone so much as eats a piece of chocolate in front of me I will beat them.  Not kidding.
I guess the first part of admitting you have a problem is admitting you have a problem, so here it goes.  Hello, my name is Heather.  I am overweight.  I weigh 310 pounds and I would like to change that, by a lot of bit.  I have gained 110 pounds in the last 8 years.  I have always been overweight and part of the problem is that I see food as a comfort.  If I am depressed, chocolate can make it better.  I hate the way my body looks, I hate the way my body feels, I hate the fact that clothes shopping is so difficult, I hate the fact that sometimes the desks at school are uncomfortable.  I want to change all of that.  My goal is to weigh 160lbs by the time that I graduate college, which is in May of 2008."

I have two tests on Wensday to study for, I can't do my fucking homework becuase it's either too damn complitcated or so fucking easy that I think it's complicated, bridge competition is this week, I have things that I need to do for ASCE but no time to get them done...I want to lose my mind!  I can't wait for next week to be here...I don't know how much more of this I can handle.  I'm nervous about competition, like I feel that we will do well, but at the same time I'm scared as hell that something bad will happen and we will be DQed.  I guess on the up-side of things Pat's supposidly riding with me so at least I'll be too nervous to be worried about the competition.  I'm scared about my two tests because I'm not sure how well I will do on them with no time to study.  At least tomorrow Jeff is going to take my spot at the shop so I can get some studying done before practice.  

As a side note, that crazy cable-stayed bridge in Toledo...definatley trying to figure out how fit that one into my route..."

Class at 8am-9 ASCE President this morning until 10, went to class, still haven't gotten to my HW--although I did fill out my planner extensivly for the next 13 weeks, i want to audit the next 10 weeks, have no desire to do so right now, have class at 3-4:30, shop from 6-God knows when, study for thermo, 
tomorrow class at 10:20, work at 12-3:30, Review session at 6pm study my ass off until I die for Thermo, 
Wed thermo exam 8am, ASCE President 9-11, maybe 12, homework after that until 3, class until 4:30 Shop from 6-God knows when
Thursday class at 10:20, work at 12-3:30, Stats from 5:30 until 6:50 and quiz, officers meeting at 7:30, CSI night at 9
Friday: class 8-9, la presidenta/homework 10:20-11:10, ADS with the Bridge 12:45-1:45, work 4-9:30
Saturday: work 6:45-11, shop 11-6, drive back to Hesperia for mom's birthday
Sunday: Drive back to EL and do my homework
Monday: repeat.

It sucks.  Andy is getting on me because I'm not out at the shop as much as he is and we're both shop supervisors (he has 6 credits mind you and I think I'm doing pretty damn good for all the shit I'm in right now).  One of these days I'm just going to go off on him and be like I QUIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Wouldn't that feel nice?  I mean, I understand where he is coming from, but at the same time it's rediculous.  I was supposed to take Mondays and Wednesdays and he was going to take Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Instead I'm out there MTW and he's out there MTWR and then we're both going to be out there everyother saturday.  I don't know what to tell him.  Today he was like what do you have going on this week because I said I could only be out there until 9 tonight and tomorrow so I told him about my test.  Steel bridge is starting to feel like a chore instead of a club.  It's not as fun anymore because I feel so forced into it.  I'm kinda upset to because I wanted to start this thing over break, but I couldn't do it without him because I didn't want to mess up, he woulda had to have been out there one day and I then I could have taken it from there.  That didn't happen.  

And I'm not saying I don't like bridge or ASCE, I'm just thinking I should have done one or the other and not both.  If I was just ASCE President I could do my HW at night and if I was just bridge captain I could do my hw during the day and be out at the shop 4 nights a week.  Why did I do both?

Not to mention I haven't seen Matt in a long time and I miss my brother :( and Josh might be on leave sometime soon...and I miss him too.

And with Bridge, homework and ASCE taking up all my free time I don't have time to do anything else.  I saw my best friend for the first time last week since the beginning of the year.  We've been back 4 weeks now.  I hardly see my roommate, it's like she don't have one because I'm gone all the time.  I want to cry, scream, quit, and lock myself into a room where no one else can get to.  Unless Pat decides to go crazy with me, then he can come too.


I gotta schedule a drinking weekend in there somewhere...

Alright...I think I'm done whining now."

"event","I guess this emotional moment has been building for a while and that is why cleaning a fish bowl is making me cry but damnit I can't fucking do anything right.  Today I cleaned my baby sister's fish bowl.  I didn't think it was healthy for the fish so I looked it up and low and behold it wasn't.  Every credible site I went to said that the state the water in that tank was was dangerous for the fish.  So I cleaned it.  Well my step mom was mad.  The Gold fish like it that way is what she said.  Now they have to rebuild their entire eco-system.  Then she took out the other rocks we put in them and got all mad about it because when she did a partial water change they were going to get stuck in the hose.  Then she was upset (this one is valid) that the bubbling stone got broken, however we replaced it with another and I told her I was sorry.  
This happens all the time.  I can't do anything right.  I refuse to help decorate the Christmas tree now after two years ago every time I put a Christmas ordiment on the tree it wasn't in the right place and she would go behind me and move it.  
I dunno, this weekend she's just been a real bitch.  We're remodeling the house and my sister's room was painted so we couldn't sleep up there, and my dad was working in the upstairs so we couldn't sleep up there so we had to sleep in the downstairs living room.  She works third shift so she stayed up until 4 am in the dining room with the light on which is next to the living room and there is no door to shut working on some stupid table cloth or something.  When I asked her if she was almost done at 3am she was like yeah, but this is when I am awake is at night.  I was all like well I understand that but this is my time to sleep cant' you do that somewhere else and she was like no and continued on.  She could have gone and helped my dad upstairs, but no, she didn't do that.  On top of all things he took her side, which he probably will again this time.  Not my problem to clean the fish tank.  
But this happens all the time.  If I come home on a weekend I'm expected to help her do all the housework that she hasn't done all week or made my brother and sister do because she doesn't want to fight with them.  It's easier for her to have me do it.  If I don't, I'm being defiant or bitchy or lazy and I hate it.  Nothings ever right and nothing is ever enough.  And if I say something to her about it she just gets mad.  And if I talk to my dad about it he either takes her side or doesnt care or it causes a fight between them and I dont' want that.
It's not right.  But then again, neither am I."

Oh man, that game was like watching a train wreck.  I think there's a reason why both teams suck as bad as they do.  But anyways my packers pulled through.  Kudos to Samkon Gado, Brett Favre, Donald Driver, Grady Jackson and the rest of the defensive line, the offensive line, Donald Lee, Antonio Chatman, William Henderson, Nick Barnett, Serveral thousand Kudos to Ryan Longwell because without him lord knows they wouldn't have won and Mike Sherman who had the intellegence to know that wasn't a safety and I think I'm forgetting someone....oh yeah!  Shaun Rogers!  Without you Shaun, the Packers might not have gotten into field goal position in overtime.  You're a good DT Shaun, but since I root for the Lions when they don't play the Packers, I don't recommend picking up the opposing team's running back and throwing them.  You're lucky Gado wasn't hurt!  You're lucky you didn't get more of a penatly because that was uncalled for.  But because of your assistance to the Packers and the fact that Samkon wasn't hurt, thank you.  But now, I must study.  Later days

oh! final score

Checked my e-mail this morning and there was a friend request from Victor Raczok, which was kinda exciting considering the fact that I haven't talked to him in years.  He doesn't look like he's changed much :P

We might actually have the bridge designed and the steel ordered before Christmas break!  I'm so exited.  I want to cut things and weld....mmmm power tools.

Snow.  Let's talk about snow for a minute.  Last night after I left the shop I went to Kierstyn's for our weekly CSI night.  Well I slept there because it was snowing like mad crazy.  I got there at 9:30 and I went out to my car to get my cell at 10:30 and there was a 1/2 inch on it already.  I probably took 6 inches off it this morning when I left....leaving sucked because the roads weren't plowed yet at 6:45, not even Dunkel and Kalamazoo.  127 was though, thank God. But I guess West Michigan didn't get it as bad as Central Michigan did because Basil had school today and they close school in Hespoky if they get like an inch.

I got to destroy Brody Complex today at work.  Lots of fun.  They had these frosted Styrofoam buildings for each dorm and what not.  When I was done there were two Bailey Halls left in the middle.  I even made sound effects as I scooped up the buildings.  It was good fun.

Place: Lambeau Field, Green Bay, Wis.
Time: 8:30pm
Station: ESPN
Who: Green Bay vs Detroit

Who's gonna win: Green Bay of course.  They got Farve and Gado and Driver and a coach.  The Lions, well...the saying goes, new coach same old lions.  They may have been GB at Ford Field, but they aren't gonna take them in Green Bay.  The Packers' performace is getting better as the season continues and I think the lions are on a down hill slope to nowhere.  Anyways Lions or Packers fan, if you want to watch the game with me Sunday let me know.

I'll bring my cheese :)"

"event","Well...I'm still suffering from withdrawls.  Today I looked at computers on Dell and Best buy.  They're expensive.  I even went as far as to fill out the dell payment plan approval.  They approved me but I didn't get the no interest thing for 12 months so screw them.  I do miss having a computer, but I think it is probably more of a material item.  I'm glad that I didn't get the AOL virus though.  That would have sucked.  I'm still working on getting it off Jamie's computer.  Ezra gave me the great idea of setting it back becuase it's got Windows XP.  Why didn't I think of that?  (Probably cuz I've been runnin 98 so long!)  Anyways...."

Basically...President Bush's rating has dropped to 37%.  ""The White House has said it doesn't pay attention to poll numbers and the figures do not affect policy.""  Now I wonder if these two have a direct corrolation to each other?"

"event","Yeah...so I took my lousy computer to Matt...he took it apart and then a clip snapped when we were trying to get the fan for the processor back on.  Then he's like, well hold it because nothing seems to be broken lets see if it turns on.  And so it did.  So he thought I was a moron...aparently the threat of Matt was enough to make it behave.  He said if I replaced the fan and it still didn't have video that the video card might be fried.  My computer now lives in my trunk.  Someday I'll get the ambition to fix the damn thing, but until then...

I realized last Tuesday that I don't see Matt enough.  He's been like a brother to me for oh...7 years or so now and we're lucky if we see eachother once a year.  I didn't realize I missed him as much as I did until I went down there to see him.

I really wish this semester was over.  Sometimes I wish there was an escape key for life and I could hit it and I could run away for a little while then come back and everything will have worked itself out.  Thanksgiving break was nice, but coming back to all the stress of deadlines and projects and tests really blows.  College would be great if it wasn't for the class portion.  I mean, I see my lab partners more than I see my roommate!  I guess I had it coming though...wanting to be an engineer and all...sigh.  If only I could get paid to scrapbook and weld (an interesting combination)...

I think part of the reason I feel like this is I got a 52% on a test that I should have gotten a 80% on.  I studied the wrong things and thought that I understood the concepts and I didn't.  A couple more hours and it would have been wonderful.  I have to stop doing that."

"event","Yesterday was particularly good...for the most part.  I don't think we sucked up our presentation too badly in CE 271 and the stadium tour definately rocked.  Brian (bridge captain from two years ago) was there, so that was really cool.  I miss him so much!  He was pretty much the only person I talked to on the team freshman year...well him and Andy...but he was the only one I really talked to.  He told us to call him if we had any questions and said he might stop out at the shop next semester.

I went to see Harry Potter last night, a decision which was worth it, but I am reapin the consequences right now.  I got like 3 hours of sleep (which is why this probably sounds slightly disjointed).  It was really good.  I was all like ""Harry!"" and Harry was all like ""Valdmort is..."" well I guess I probably shouldn't finish that seeing how not everyone's seen it yet and this ia public posting.  But it's good.  Go see it.  Right now.  Close the window, get in your car or on the bus and go see the movie!  (Call ahead though because there might not be tickets anymore.  This might actually be more rambly than a drunken post...

On to the next subject.  Graduation.  Not mine, but a bunch of my friends.  I know it's in the spring, I think seeing Brian last night is what made me think of it, but it's gonna suck.  If you're one of these people, you're just not allowed to graduate this year or next year.  You have to wait two more years, then we all can graduate together and create our own engineering ghetto in some subdivision somewhere.  It'll be fun.  We can borrow cups of sugar and shit from each other and have bbqs, and it will be great.  Promise.  Anyways, if you're names on the list...you know what that means ;)

Patrick O'Neill
Andy Bates
Mike Briggs
Shannon Hunt
Jessica Bitnar
Jennifer Passmore
Alan Hahn
Jeff Roberts

and Brian and Scott can come live in the subdivision with us.

Just so you know, I am going to get as many of the non-graduating bridge team together as possibe and we're all gonna sit with our bridge shirts on and go to the CE graduation, and I might even cry.  I'll try not to, but the possiblity is there.  

Anyways...if this doesn't make any sense I apologize.  My brain has that ""low fuel"" light flashing right now.  I think I have just enough dew to get me through my next two classes.  Then I think I'll crash.  My blankets sound sooo nice right now.  It's really cold in the trans lab.  I think someone has the air on.  Alright, class time.  Hopefully I make it through without falling out because it would be bad to fall asleep in the assistant dean's class..."

"event","CE 271: currently receiving a 4.0
ME 222: if I get 100% on the next 3 quizzes and a damn good grade in my lab and like a 95 on the final I can get a 3.0 with no curve.
MSE 250: probably getting a 2.5 or a 3.0...but we're gonna fix that...hopefully 3.5ing it
IAH 207: I'm gonna forcast a 3.0-3.5 overall.

Leaving me probably just shy of the engineering college...or at least the civil engineering college.

One more semester of being a physics major.

If I can miracolously do a lot better than I am anticipating I will I'll get in...but I'll be in next semester for sure! :)"

"event","Alright...so this might be a little bit of an Ego trip because I can feel my confidence rising and I definately have been walkin around the EB like a bad ass but I diserve it damn it.  
Yesterday I was playing around with the bridge in our structures program and I was looking at the diagrams for both load cases and load case two didn't make sense.  It seemed to have a lot less deformation than load case one and it should have been the opposite because of where the supports were located.  So I looked into the loads--it was missing one of them.  So I fixed it.  The whole bridge.  Using a program that I only know how to use from what Pat, Andy and Alan have showed me (Many Kudos to them for showing me how to use it), I fixed the darn thing.  I then sent it to them and was like I fixed it, is it right?  So Alan comes up to me in the trans lab today and was like did you do that?  I was like yea.  He was like good job.  I was like was it right?  and he was like yea.  
So yeah...I'm a junior bad ass.  Confidence level is at an unusual high...it's almost as high as it was in high school.  I think this bridge co-captian thing is good for me...hopefully the president of the ASCE will be good for me too.  

Alright Bragging is all done with!"

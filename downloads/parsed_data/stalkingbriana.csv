we met at avantis before we went to see The Passion, and she gave me peeps and nerds. i thought that was great because i love sugar.



                              the movie gave me a lot to think about. very humbling to say the least. My Jesus gave up so much for me, and i'm still so selfish with everything. I dont deserve this love. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       <3briana...thanks for my sugar supply. youre the best"

"event","yesterday me and briana went to a chinese buffet with josh and robbyn. we had fun. accept for 2 things...i spilled sweet and sour sauce on my pants..and briana had a piece of hair in her salad. BUT. robbyn and josh made up for it. josh made up for it with his funny big boob face. wow. that was funny. briana is laughing right now..i can feel it. THEN. Robbyn made up for it with her cute story about how josh proposed. AND her funny stories about her brother in law..haha.
   after that. me and nanni went to josies house for a while and did mikes hair. that was fun. mike is really nice and josie, played the guitar, of course.
  we went to greg and chris and jarrods youth group again. it was fun, the english people were there.. i love their accents.
    sarah eastman was there too...she is awesome. i love her. haha. i'm actually laughing out loud. that girl cracks me up. briana likes her too.( otherwise she wouldnt have made this amazing journal.)
 after we left...we went back to brianas to work on nolans surprise..sarah came too...and let me just say. she definetely added to the experience. haha. nolan, don't be mad that nannie wont tell you. youll be glad when you get it. its better as a surprise. 
    yah... so this journal is getting really boring. maybe ill try to make it SUPER EXCITING next time i write in it.
   
~~~~ just so you know...briana took a HOT bubble bath on saturday, and she enjoyed it.~~~~
  *its kinda sad that i actually am stalking her."

"event","me and nannie had quite an eventful day today. 
    after church,we went to lunch with robbyn and josh and josie too. it was fun. robbyn and josh are great. i like them alot. robbyn also had a really cute jacket on. nannie liked it too.
   after lunch we went to my apartment and looked at my last year's yearbook. it was funny. bri was in the pictures from vice-versa. cutie pie with short hair.
   this part is fun!...we went to the blicks and i did abby's hair! fun fun! blonde and red. she is a really sweet girl with a really cute laugh. i'd say me and nannie pick her as our favorite 8th grader. she had alot of things to say, and i enjoyed listening.
   i wanted the panthers to win. because josh told me i did. me and briana stopped by church to watch the last part of the game, and they lost. i was disapointed. oh well. im even more disapointed that josie dropped HER on the black top, and hurt her knee..i think it still hurts...that sucks. 
   briana loves nolan...i can tell. im happy for her.
sara eastman was at the superbowl thing. she is really funny. ive never hung out with her before. briana said im allowed too.haha.(i have to get her permission....haha)
   we listened to my new cd a bit today. damien rice...from sean..i hope she liked it.
goodnight briana."

"event","last night me and nanni went to ty the rockstars rock show. she brought bananas, and i brought hot chocolate. too bad she spilled the hot cocoa all over her pants and my car. the bananas were really good tho.(we got some funny looks...not many ""scene kids"" eat bananas at shows.)
    we like to make fun of scene kids. anyway. we missed the entire set. we got there for the last 1 minute of ty's last song. he wasnt too pleased with us.
    next we went to monicals, and FATTY nannie ate her entire personal pan pizza. thats ok..she's still the cutest little nannie ever.
    then we went to josie's and sang copland really really loud...that was fun. lots of laughing. i always laugh when im with briana. i love her so much (no i hate her). we also took really funny pictures. im not really sure how too girls could laugh so much. luckily josie wasnt too annoyed, and he sang us some songs on the geeeetar.yay. 
   josie is coming to bloomington with me tonight.fun fun. (sorry briana. i didnt mean to talk about someone else). 
   one other thing that i thought you should all know about briana is that she likes the part of that copland song that says..""and she said that i was the brightest little firefly in her jar.""

pointless..this is pointless.

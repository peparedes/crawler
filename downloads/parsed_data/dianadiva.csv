"event","Forget about the Oscars...we have academy award winning acting here in the South;OH,you knew that because you are the ""ones""...Tim was soooo natural...in a unnatural situation it would have been nice if everyone in the play was the same there were some good male actors but they didn't get it every minute....man and the women wow,they didn't even get the Jewish jokes and problems (what: like we have had 2000 YEARS TO UNDERSTAND Hebrew rights?That just made me Mad except the Angel sounded like Bette Middler so that was cool> Man even Tim's partner didn't get it all the time or was trying too hard...
   My trip was really wonderful except the car.But,even in a lousy car Road trips are so awesome..i love the agony and ecstasy of it all...praying to make it to the next exit before i open the hood to put in more antifreeze and water... wow,it was horrible...making a three hour trip into 8 even after going 78 'cause i forget my car is saying 70 but only going 65 which is good because i do have a lead foot...but when it gets to 80 it has palsy or epileptic seizure...even going up to Little Rock it did that...and those State hwys reminded me how much i love the Expressways..wow even 49.
    But Teresa and LeAnne were so wonderful hostess' even surprised me at dinner with Sarah and Jeremy..She is sooo gorgeous and Jeremy is too, and she can sing too...lollq (BTY,LQ means laughing quietly and i coined it ten years ago in and email to Teresa, Jimmy_0 and leAnne and have the copy to prove it,so use it and give me the credit  thinking of me for a billionth of a second that is faster than a nano sec isn't it?
   While i am at it High Wire is a Song written for me for Four Score and refers ONLY to the feeling you get at center stage {the position not the theater in Biloxi}and center stage feels the same when you nail it every where in the World...i coined that 6 year ago in the Ocean Springs record.
   Sunday,we cleaned up for the Oscar party and i said i want to help Te says ""will you Dust""...well in my head i say oh,no the last job i want ""oh, that is great; that will be FUN"" so i am up on the step stool actually having fun getting the top shelf..and wiping each piece underneath and all on the third shelf there are four red glasses that are really pretty for some reason i wipe over them not moving them ...then when i was on the fourth shelving unit Te says can you wipe under neath them>LOLOLOLLQ!!~~!!But,that night after allergy attacks and all that i meet this 6' 8 "" beautiful Ace from idol ( people he can sing, i can tell he just didn't show it yet>lq)looking male that now  is my BOYFRIEND {for those of you who don't yet that it means something(he's gay)}.IT was a wonderful time...
  So, on the way back I go to Brinkley to see my oldest best friend from College..yeah,I am Older than Shit..tee hee hee,Tha was great then she gives me 40 dollars.then tells me her widows benefits were stopped (oh shit,i am scum and karma is perfect{.But i get to say no to mom that i don't need money (Sweet). I get to Hattiesberg at 8:30 and no one is there:karen is in a drama breakup with her BF she has been with for 8 years?Only her second BF except Matt Seiler for two weeks before Jess Rossman:anyway i go to St Elmo's with her and tell have so much fun BSing with them telling them about being a token white on a Black newspaper i the late 70's and talking deep philosophy then saying i am all BS( but that was true..then a girl at the bar says she liked my Shrt i explain Walter Anderson She fially gets it and knows(she is HOT)the art..after i go stand in line at the bath room i go back and say you didn't see me at all i am the ghost of Janice Joplin really.Then in the bath room i do the70's hair flip and go out really looking like JJ>>> it was GREAT!!!~~~!!!!!"

Also, loved the company i was with; it was the most fun being here...Thankz, friends.
Was happy with the ending except BB not getting Best Pic.
I noticed during clips how much i always {even long ago} equated our DAME JUDY with every role Dame Dench or Maggie Smith played...I remember telling her so  after the plays i saw her in how deep she made me think about the play and her part. So, i just want to say Thank you Ms Judy for being our own ""English Lady of the Theatre""."

"event","The World is Ending, soon you know.
   Why can't we listen to what others say
Without putting our own insecurities first.
   Why don't they listen to our favorable intent?
Each only trying to do their best.
   
    I only meant good in the observation, you know.
Did not mean to compare you that way.
    Look around the world and see that Revelations is espewing* forth.
Had to let you know before the end that you were loved. 
    Only meditations of good vibrations i sent your way.

    Believing in magic i only hope to see you have a better day."

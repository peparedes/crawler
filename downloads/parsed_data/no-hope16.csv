I cry.  I cry everynight when I am alone.  you know why I cry.  its because I feel bad I want to be a better friend to people but I cant somthing is holding me back.  I cant even tell my friends what I want to say to them.  I am afraid to say things to my friend because I dont want her to not want to be my friend.  I love my friend so much(as a friend!)she is my family and I dont want to loose our friendship that I am afraid if I tell her certain things even if there little that she wont want to be my friend.  ..........but I think because I do that.  That she hates me now.  And that were starting to not be friends anymore.  I dont want that to happen her and my cat is all I have and If I loose her as my friend then I dont have anyone.

I feel alone right now.  I deserve it though

Yea I know you dont care. just dont read my journal anymore.  forget about me.  forget I exsist so It can be easier for me to kill myself.

I want to tell my friend some other things I havent told her yet....But I cant

--Paint Bombs                          

To make a pain bomb you simply need a metal paint can with a 
refasten able lid, a nice bright color paint (green, pink, purple, 
or some gross color is perfect!), and a quantity of dry ice. Place 
the paint in the can and then drop the dry ice in. Quickly place 
the top on and then run like hell! With some testing you can time 
this to a science. It depends on the ratio of dry ice to paint to 
the size of the can to how full it is. If you are really pissed 
off at someone, you could place it on their doorstep, knock on the 
door, and then run!! Paint will fly all over the place HAHAHA!!

--The easiest way to hotwire cars                 

Get in the car. Look under the dash. If it enclosed, forget it 
unless you want to cut through it. If you do, do it near the 
ignition. Once you get behind or near the ignition look for two 
red wires. In older cars red was the standard color, if not, look 
for two matched pairs. When you find them, cross them and take 
off!                                


--Tennis Ball Bombs                         

Ingredients:

- Strike anywhere matches
- A tennis ball
- A nice sharp knife
- Duct tape

Break a ton of match heads off. Then cut a SMALL hole in the tennis 
ball. Stuff all of the match heads into the ball, until you can't 
fit any more in. Then tape over it with duct tape. Make sure it is 
real nice and tight! Then, when you see a geek walking down the 
street, give it a good throw. He will have a blast!!


--A different kind of Molitoff Cocktail               

Here is how you do it:
 - Get a coke bottle & fill it with gasoline about half full

 - Cram a piece of cloth into the neck of it nice and tight

 - Get a chlorine tablet and stuff it in there. You are going to have
to force it because the tablets are bigger than the opening of the 
bottle. 

 - Now find a suitable victim and wing it in their direction. When it 
hits the pavement or any surface hard enough to break it, and the chlorine
and gasoline mix..... BOOM!!!!!!
Have fun!                                 

--This is another good way to                     
rip off a change or drink machine....                   
 
You first get a nice new dollar to work with.  Make sure there are no
rips in it.  Now, you get a thin piece of transparent plastic about
3/4 the width of the actual dollar.  It must be a good 6"" or longer.
Next, you need some transparent tape.  Scotch magic tape will work
the best.  You simply tape the plastic strip to the dollar.  But, you
must be careful not to tape it more than 1/2"" up the side of the dollar.
tape it on both sides (front and back, not top and bottom) of the dollar.
Now, all you have to do is use it:

Walk casually up to the secluded machine.  Take out your dollar, and put
it into the machine.  BE CAREFUL! Some of the more modern change machines
have alarms!  Most likely, though, drink or candy machines will not.  Now,
the machine starts taking your dollar.... You wait until your plastic
strip is almost all the way into the machine, and then you pull with
sufficient force to get the dollar out of the machine, but not rip it.  If
You did it correctly, you should have gotten whatever you bought, and still
have your dollar for later use.  On candy machines, though, make your
selection, and then wait and pull the dollar out.  Don't worry if you don't
get it on the first few tries.  It took me about 5 tries to master it.  It
DOES, i repeat DOES work for a fact if done correctly.  If you just can't
get it, though, either the machine is too sophisticated, or you put the
tape up too high on the dollar.

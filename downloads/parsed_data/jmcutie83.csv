"event","so it is now 3:19 am and it is like the latest i have been up in a very long time. The reason for this madness is stupid fucking english2 and i am having to write my final research paper by monday and i havent even started!!!!!!!!!! i am so horrible usually i have it done like at least 5 days before but noooo.  of course it is not totally my fault because my mom dragged me around town all day and night today but uh well.  so this sucks because i took a stacker earlier to try and stay up and it made me fall asleep on and off like 3 hours ago but now im up and reaady to go but i cant i have to go to sleep or i will  never last tomorrow!!! so i am gonna go try that and see how it works out it will be like my 3rd attempt to go to bed for the night but ya know it happens! see ya later !"

"event","<center><font size=""1"">Let's pretend were not needy. 
Let's pretend our hearts still beat. 
Let's pretend we fall in love tonight, 
Clumsy enough to fall for anything. 
We'll stumble on our words. 
We'll spill our guts on creaking bar stools, 
Below the neon blue. 
Low lives hiding in dives there's no feeling in drinking, sleeping with strangers. 
Ghosts passing through bedrooms unaware, 
A faint reflection on the barback's mirror, 
A face I never knew whispering,
""Please dont be a stranger to me. Who are you if you're alone?"" 
You're no good at pretending. 
All my plays have tragic endings, 
You wish I was a fairy tale. 
This frog will never change anything. 
Just pretend that you're in love, 
That scolding sun is bound to come up eventually. 
So who is it that whispers in your ear? 
A haunting voice blows in through the window. 
There's no feeling floating over beds,
A needy pleading apparition 
Crying, ""Who am I if I'm alone?
I hardly exist at all.
Let's pretend that we don't need anything anymore from anyone.
I don't want to feel anything anymore let's just pretend, we'll live happily ever after.""

echoes leading down a hall
To a room, there's music playing
Tiny bells with moving parts
Here the shadows make things ugly
an effect quite undesirable
And The gold and yellow daylight
Grows like ivy across the wall
And it bounces off of the painted porcelain
A tiny dancing doll
Her body spins as she pirouettes
Again the world suddenly seems small
On an off-white, subtle morning
You stretch your legs in the front seat
The road has made a vacuum
Where our voices used to be
And you lay your head onto my shoulder
Pour like water over me
So if I just exist for the next ten minutes of this drive that would be fine
And all these trees that line this curb would be rejoicing and alive
Soon all the joy that pours from everything makes fountains of your eyes
Because you finally understand the movement of a hand waving good-bye

"event","He smiled to the world,
But his heart fell below his pain.
He wanted only arms,
But he lied to himself again.

Closing doors and locking locks,
He looked inside himself.
Only to find, deep down fear.

Oh let me fall in two.
Let me fall in two.
Let me fall in two.

Wide as a river, and spread as thin,
What he could start no one would finish.
Bottled up brown entry they saw what they were,
Knowing not nothing, he was the only son.

Closing doors and locking locks,
He looked inside himself.
Only to find, seeping from his soul.

Let me fall in two.
Let me fall in two.
Let me fall in two.

What are you running from.
What are you running from.
What are you running from.
What are you running from.

He finds himself a way.
Only to want the world to find (But he finds himself a way),
You try to leave but there is nothing he can do.

Down cast eyes,
Scrutinize,
As to what the lead ball humming bird would not succumb.
To find what is gone you must burn what is dried,
And smell the essence of what remains inside.
But blackened thoughts,
Erase all that is past,
Before him,
Not knowing where he's coming.
So you shake him around,
And scream into his eyes,
That to drown in the water is to lie by his side.

Closing doors and locking locks,
He looked inside himself.
Only to find, seeping from his soul.

that is an amazing song."

"event","Last night was amazing. Went to the For Another Day show. Matt drove me and then from there I met up with Gabby, Brad, and some other people as well. The whole car ride I was made fun of by Matt and Phil, needless to say it was very funny. They played really good...glad I went. Then we drove home with an addition of Gabby because her parents are crazy. 

It's so wierd last night everyone told me who they have a crush on and stuff and it's wierd because when they asked me...I couldn't bring myself to say your name.


Really really great night. Hopefully tonight something will be going on."

I'm sitting in my kitchen and I'm looking at a Chirstmas card and It was a picture of two little kids (friends of the family I guess)And they are sitting in this thing. So I go to my mom, ""Why are they sitting in a giant egg?""...she looks at me in disgust and goes ""You idiot they are sitting in a christmas ornament hanging on a tree!!"" 

None the less...I felt kinda dumb after that."

"event","Last night was amazing. Lake Avenue played at Empress so me and Laura went over there. When we got there it was freezing, but we got to sit in a car where it was warm. While in the car we were attacked (literally people were flinging themselves on the car) pretty funny. Then the doors finally opened so we went in. Firts couple of bands were alright. Hung out with a lot of people too many to name. Then Lake Avenue went on and besides the fact that everything went wrong they played amazing as usual. Then I danced with Barry because I looked over and he was dancing with some kid (don't remember who) so he asked me if I wanted to dance too...so I did, Very funny. Then Jen's dad drove us to her house and we hung out there for a while. Talked about really stupid shit. Then me and Laura got picked up and went home. Really good night in all"

Then I was walking out to the buses with Gabby and I left for one second and I come back and her and kevin were kissing and i'm scarred for life now...its horrible. I ran on my bus and I can't look at her anymore hahaha. Thanks Gina Gabriella. Anyway thats my wonderful day so far. Now it's supposed to snow and  i'm very happy. Everyone hates the snow..I don't really it's a nice change. Pays to live in the middle of nowhere in the winter I guess."

"event","Well today was a really good day. School went by fast and I was wide awake even though I only got about four hours of sleep! Well after school I forgot my key so I went to Laura's house and we played some ""ghetto baseball"". Ok picture this...We made her basement have four bases and we used a little novelty bat and a little stuffed ball thing...we rolled one pant leg up and pulled our hair up on the top of our heads. We played some of her brothers rap and we spoke some ghetto lingo. funny as hell. Then I had to go, but tomorrow will bring another day of ghetto baseball hopefully. Well thats all for right now...besdies these quizes and such.

Good bands it was fun. My friend is being stalked online by this kid...funny as hell if you ask me...poor thing. well thats it! yup.

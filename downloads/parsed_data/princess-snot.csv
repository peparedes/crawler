"event","this weekend i saw MY ADAM! i am so in love with him that i would totally marry him, but gays can't marry, right? oh well. its so sick that i seriously could marry him, totally legally, in every state in the country. ah well. i AM in love with him. i havent seen him in forever, since i broke up with his psycho ex-best friend, sanya. now he knows shes nuts. so we can make fun of her behind her back. anyway, we went to the improv and it was ever so much fun. i can't even begin to explain it, he's just a big old queen and im very happy that were speaking again.

...and i saw beth and we went to viva vienna and i won a HOT PINK BLOWUP GUITAR! beth had her pink blowup sax and we pretended like we were rock stars and danced with them in front of her mirror and lip synched to dressy bessy. we are so damn cool. hey beth- ill bet you thought that secret was safe but hahahah, the world knows what freakin dorks we are. i am so devious. lalalalala, we also watched being john malkovitch and i too am now smitten with cameron diaz. thats really a great name, i never realized it before. the movie was a lot queerer than i expected. and i can do the fly! huzzah!

...and <b>EVERYONE</b> must come to the dykemarch poster party this saturday(june 5)! its at the witman walker clinic, 1407 S st. nw (u st cardozo metro, 13th st exit) you can be a marshal (we desperately need more!) which means you keep all the dykes in line and keep em all safe and its really not hard, you pretty much usher them away from traffic and know what to do in emergencies and get a hot pink T.W.A.T. Team (thats ""tigers, wild and tame"" you know) t shirt and you need to show up at 10 am and the poster making and all is at 12-3pm, same place and day and all, you can make gorgeous posters and t shirts for the marshals and noise makers and organizer sashes and pasties if you'd like (but dont need in dc!!!) and well provide everything, but bring stuff if you can- especially posterboard, markers and those avery labels, the ones they use for address labels that we can make stickers with- we need them desperately, steal them from work, school, yr parents, whatever. and you can also learn to EAT FIRE!! we will have the trainer there again! its so great- even if you cant come to the march, please help out! we will be sidewalk chalking the area too! yay!"

anyway, beth is staying over this whole weekend and i think we should watch The Company which is this cool-looking movie about ballet, very nice eye candy, i dunno if its in theatres or on video yet, though, and we should do the sandbox ""beach"" thing and go to georgetown and maybe a picnic in dupont or go to takoma or... MAKE MUSIC- duh! my tonsils are much smaller, so dont forget to bring the tape recorder! AND THE SCOOTERS!! I'M excited...

metro:
how i love to ride you, dear metro,
each seat an orange plastic pillow
that takes me where i want to go
on red green orange blue or yellow

so, dear, where's your purple line?
it's missing from your rainbow sign,
and makes me bitch rant wail and whine
about it in my little rhyme

sometimes i would like to schmooze
with the ladies in the skirt suits and tennis shoes
and the boys drinkin booze havent heard the news
that dear lady metro, you are my muse
************
I'm gonna be a star today
and im gonna go so far today
im gonna write some songs
and my shoes will be thongs
and ill walk on the beach
maybe eat a peach
or a pear or a berry
and ill vote for john kerry-
EVEN THOUGH DENNIS KUCINICH IS MY BOYFRIEND!!!
************
I tried cryin-
I tried dyein my hair
I tried buyin-
some new uncerwear

"event","ugh i am so sick. im in school but i still feel like crap. i was late and got mcdonalds for breakfast so now i have a little bit of an upset stomach. ugh. my throat hurts so bad, i have an ulcer on my tonsil and it sounds VERY serious. yesterday was my dads birthday and i didnt get him anything. its ok, hes an alcoholoc loser. im thirsty. bring me a soda. and milk and honey. mmm, that sounds good right now. ummm... im too tired. <lj-cut text=im-such-a-teenager> i had a big ridiculous fight with my mom about her piece of crap computer thats about ten years old and slow as hell and she blames it on me because i apparently designed windows so that there can be multiple names to sign in under (you know, those things that just give different family members different backgrounds and screensavers) so she thinks that after *I* did that, the computer was SO full of programs that she couldnt access her profile thing (even though you can just press cancel and get into it with the basic settings) because she forgot her password (my fault too??) and it was SO frustrating trying to talk to her that i started crying hysterically and i was all snotty from being sick and it was just a big miserable mess but don't worry, we made up when i kept asking her what this certain fabric was called, but it was funny at the time. maybe were just INSANE! </lj-cut>
so theres this certain fabric that rich ladies wear suits of thats kind or shiny and textured and its not like velvet, its got a sort of rustic linen-like (i think) horizontal/vertical texture and looks like multiple shades of a color woven in with each other and its shiny, kind of stiff and um ive only seen it on tailored women's suits with a 50s feel to them-- WHAT IS IT CALLED?????"

DID YOU KNOW THAT ITS CURRENTLY LEGAL TO SHOW NIPPLES IN DC?? some woman won a case and nudity is only illegal when you show genitals. isnt that great?? i wish everywhere were like that and that and that there were lots and lots of exposed breasts around. in school too. but no old teachers, i dont want to see wrinkly nipples, thank you very much. i wouldnt be able to walk straight... ahhh...

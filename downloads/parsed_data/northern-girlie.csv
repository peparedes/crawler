Martina McBride's ""There You Are""! It's so pretty and Martina is her favourite artist so it works! Yep so instead of doing a speech which by the way may I add I'm horrible at doing, I've decided to sing my words to her and Kevin! Should be a beautiful wedding! Well I've been training at Teletech for about 2 weeks now! Not so bad so far! I give them a lot more credit then what most people have said about the company! Man getting up everyday for 6 has been friggin hard! I'M SO TIRED! Pat and I go to bed like at 10! Which never used to happen as Cyn might know! We're like night owls! Especially her! And well she kept me awake sometimes! OH NO WAIT THAT WAS MARTIN'S FAULT! STUPID MARTIN! Oh man I miss my S4 people! I miss being on my own! I MISS MY ROOMATE AND HER SILLY WAYS! OH CYNTHIA you superstitious girl you! Gotta jet!"

"event","""Don't Tell Me"" 
You held my hand and walked me home I know
While you gave me that kiss it was something like this it made me go ooh ohh
You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears, why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love 
Guys are so hard to trust
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl? 
The one who gives it all away

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? 
Did you think that it was somethin I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do,
Dont try to tell me what to say,
Your better off that way

Don't think that your charm and the fact that your arm is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget 
I'm gonna ask you to stop, thought I liked you a lot, but I'm really upset 
Get out of my head get off of my bed yeah thats what I said
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl, the one who, throws it all away

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? 
Did you think that it was somethin I was gonna do and cry? 
Don't try to tell me what to do,
Dont try to tell me what to say,
Your better off that way

This guilt trip that you put me on won't, mess me up I've done no wrong
Any thoughts of you and me have gone away

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? 
Did you think that it was somethin I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do,
Dont try to tell me what to say,
Your better off that way

Better off that way 
I'm better off alone anyway



This really has nothing to do with the entry below! Just a song that was in my head right at the time!"

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#33ccff>So yeah! I'm almost 20! AHHH... I don't know if I want to be 20! Because people keep freaking me out by saying stuff like ""Hey think about it in 10 years you'll be 30!"" 30! FUCK! I'm not thinking of 30! I'm not even done school yet!! I mean it's a good thing and it's a bad thing! No longer can I be called a teenager and I have to act like an adult now! But then I guess it's a cool thing because I'm an adult and finally get people to take me seriously! </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffff66><STRONG>So I'm thinking I want to go out to a pub for my birthday! Everyone keeps telling me different things. Lets go to Louie's, let's go to a pub! I DON'T CARE... as long as I'm having a good time it doesn't matter to me where we go! I'm hoping people come out! That would be really nice! I already know of a few people but every birthday always turns into a disaster someway somehow! Lets make this the year that it won't be destroyed or ruined! </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff><STRONG>Anyways, I think it's time for me to do some productive work now! BYE BYE!</STRONG></FONT></P>

"event","So yeah, I had the best weekend ever!! Pat, my Dad and Rosa all came up on Thursday night and stayed until today! It was really awesome... So then on Friday after I was done classes we all went up to London to meet Pat's other side of the family! WOW... was I nervous!! His sister and brother are so nice and we're planning a trip of some sort for them to come visit or we go down! Whatever works best! Him and his sister look so much alike! Pat has to send me pictures! Then after coming back from London, Pat and I went to Mongolian for some martinis and to just sit back and talk and what not! Saturday morning we headed to T-Dot! That was fun too! We did some shopping and swimming! Went out for beer and pizza that night! Then went swimming some more! STUPID BITCH AT THE SWIMMING POOL THOUGH! Have a staring problem much? There was this woman as soon as we entered the pool who just kept staring at us and giving us nasty looks! I seriously have no clue what her problem was! Then there was these two little old ladies who did the same thing!! PEOPLE THESE DAYS! Can't people just mind their own business! Then we headed back to Waterloo today and had some food at Kelsey's! I wish they had stayed the extra day! OH WELL! Can't win them all! Awesome weekend, now I'm back to reality of studying for my midterm this Thursday! LAST ONE! WHOO HOO! Thank god!"

"event","Well, wow, I haven't written here in a long time, but I think it's necessary. So what's happened to me since the last time I wrote... *rereads last entry*. Well that was as long of a pause and I had though. 

Good news!!!! Well my family does love Sam, they think he's great now. Although there were mixed emotions when we told them we were engaged and going to be married in March. But it all calmed down and things started to make sense. 

Sam and I were married in the temple on March 21st, 2008 in the Seattle LDS Temple. We're going back to school, me at Whatcom, and Sam at Western. The reception was ridiculous. Dad cooked, and it was standing room only. Oh and everyone LOVED the food. They wanted dad to stay and open up a restaurant. I thought that was funny.

Bekah made it up here and every! I was soooooo happy to see her! Yeah, it was great. 

Sam and I now live in our new apartment and even though it's really dinky and tiny, it's still a nice place. We really like it. It's a small studio near Western so Sam can walk to school, and as soon as I can get my name changed, I'll be able to start work as well. 

Although Sam's family is great, his dad, sister, and brother are all amazing people. his mother irritates the crap out of me. She needs to shut up and keep her opinions to her self. Sam and I are married, our decisions of how we conduct our life and business are OUR decisions NOT HERS. She has no right to come into our apartment and lecture us, especially me, on the fact that there are a few loose ends that haven't been tied up yet. Well guess what, yesterday was my birthday wench, so we took a break from things and went to class and then just enjoyed eachother's company while playing DDR and eating at Osaka. GO AWAY! grrrr! 

I almost kicked her out last night. I should have. I really should have.

Oh, and my mother is a bitch too. I wouldn't feel bad at all if Bonnie didn't invite her to the wedding. Honestly I think it would be better if she didn't. Mom didn't want to go to Natalie's because there would be alcohol there, well there wasn't because it was in the Everson LDS Church Building, but still. And well, we all know that Bonnie's will have alcohol, so maybe mom wont go. Or Bonnie could invite Grandpa, then mom definitely wouldn't go. 

So in conclusion, everyone loves Sam, as they should, he's an amazing guy, the wedding went fantastic, I got to see Bekah, the apartment is a good one, my in-laws are amazing, except Mary who can bite me, and my mother is being a bitch as usual. 

But Bonnie's getting married to Bryce!!!!!!! yayayayayay!!!!!!!!!! *happy dance for them!!!!*

see you in another 6 months probably. Ha ha."

"event","So this would be so much easier if they didn't hate him. Sam doesn't really like being around my family because they don't like him. Which sucks because if this is going to be any easier, they need to not hate him. It's hard on me trying to either just ignore them or stand up for him. *sigh* Sometimes I just want it all to end and either say good-bye to one or the other, but only being able to find the harmony between them both do I know that I will find happiness. He's trying so hard to do the right thing so they don't have a reason to hate him, and rightfully they don't. He's helped out Launi a few times, and he's nothing but polite to their face and even when he's just talking to me about them. He's not two faced at all, and he's just the sweetest man in the world. I wish they could see that. And I wish they could understand how age isn't an issue and was never even mentioned until after we realized we started liking each other. We met in a place where you don't look at age. In a place where it really doesn't matter, you're there because you share common interests and have the same goals. 

I wish they could understand how much he means to me and how much it means to me that they TRY to like him. I know that if they did they would! It's not hard to like him. He shares so many parts of my life. He's interested in much that I am. And would have a lot of things in common with others in my family as well. He's the guy I've been looking for who can connect with me, obviously, but also be able to get a long with my family as well, if not better, than I can because he doesn't have all of the past pain with him that still gnaws at him. 

Like I said, things would just be so much easier if they didn't hate him. If they didn't want to kill him. If we didn't have to quit D&D to go hang out with them to try and get them to know him so they would change their attitude about him. I love Sam, and they can't change that, all they can do is hurt me by hating the man I love without sound reason. I deal in logic, and the logic they have of disliking him is that he's a)my boyfriend and b) 6.5 years older than me. 

If they really got to know him and our relationship, then they wouldn't hate him so much. 

Ugh, I just want this entire thing to be over with and hopefully it will be."

"event","Hey, so I haven't written here in a really long time, well nothing substatial. So on a completely and total update since I really can't remember the last time I updated: YOHAN IS THE GREATEST GUY EVER! I met him in Seminary at the begining of the year when I had a clash with my original teacher. So I went to the teacher I had last year, Sis. Noland, SHE ROCKS! And she welcomed me completely. My first day I looked and sitting in the back row, where he still sits every day, was Yohan, first thing that ran into my mind, ""There's  really cute asian sitting in the back row of this class that I don't know... I shall have to rememdy that."" So then I didn't really pay any mind to him except glance at him from time to time, then one day shortly after i started going to Sis. Nolan's class, I noticed that the name ""Yohan"" was on the calendar... I said, ""Wait, someone in this class as the sweet name of Yohan?!"" Yohan looked at me, smiled and raised his hand and said, ""Yeah, that's me."" Then again I didn't pay him any mind except those glances... ha ha. Then one day someone stole the normal seat I sat in, so then the seat next to Yohan was open. I say, ""Fine, I'll sit next to Yohan, he's got a sweet name."" That kinda became my seat. The next day he was trying to fold an Origami Crane... he got to a certain point and couln't remember the rest. I noticed what he was doing and then motioned to see it, and he gave it to me and finally I figured it out, then he randomly drew Luigi on a scrap piece of paper he had. I commented that it was awesome! then asked why not Mario... aparently he can't draw Mario. Then when we were getting into our separate cars I called to him and said he should totally learn to draw Yoshi over the weekend because it would be awesome. The next day we were in class... he draws Yoshi!!! Since then Yohan and I have become really good friends. So good infact that he planned on asking me out... until I told him not to. I don't want to date exclusively and he understood that, so a few months after first meeting and drawing and doing Origami in class together, I surprise him by coming home from Texas early, on a scale of 1-10 it was a 10 of how happy he was that I was home. He had a count down going in his head till I got home and really missed me. I often go to Bellingham to surprise him and often drive him home from school when I can. And I've surprised him so much with a painting, coming home early, hawaiian necklace, that he gets these ""funny feelings"" when I'm going to surprise him. New Years Day I didn't even mean to surprise him, I was going to Fred Meyer's because mom needed me to pick up a few things, and I saw his parents. Because I know that his family is REALLY close so I knew he was near by, so then seeing him walking into the electronic section (lucky me that's where I needed to go anyways) I walk calmly up to him then when i'm 5ft from him I say, ""Told ya I had 1337 ninja skillz."" He turns around and goes, ""How do you keep doing that?!"" So yeah and then today I pick him up because Whatcom was canceled(YES!). We WERE going to go to Josh's and hit him with a snowball, but he wasn't home... no idea where he was, so we went to my sister Michelle's because we had to get Chris off the bus, but we ended up paying in the snow in Mickey's back yard! Ha ha! It was great! Tanner and Chris ganged up on Yohan, then those little dorks turned on me! Their very own Auntie! Humph! I tackled and took down Yohan, failed at a ninja roll, looked like frosty the snowman, Yohan flipped me over his back when trying to tackle him, and Tanner hit him in the ear with a now ball. Yeah it was a blast. We had LOTS of fun. And hopefully if school is canceled tomorrow we're going to play in the snow more and work on my paper and his presentation for our Culminating Problems. ... yeah you know what I'm talking about; complete and total Culminating Problems. 

Okay, so yeah, Yohan is amazing, and there's nothing I have found that I don't like about him, he talks!!!! and GIVES HUGS IN PUBLIC! And he gives ABSOLUTELY AMAZING HUGS!!!! Oh man! It's fantastic! ^_^!!!! yeah, makes a very happy Beth out of me! Ha ha, yeah I'm going to stop writing... that's not even half of what I could write about him, but I'll spare you guys, you probably don't actually care anyways. lol. Cya!"

*Smiles* Well other than that wonderful happening tonight, it finally hit me how much I actually love Kaji. We were on the boardwalk and we had to go find Happy and Hutch cuz we needed to get Kaji home ontime. Well we found them and Happy was crying... The first thing that came to my head was that Hutch was leaving... this conclusion came from a message that I heard on Happy's message machine telling her that he really needed to talk to her because his parents ""had plans"" when he was in Cali... And for some reason I felt like Suki and I was proud of it. I remembered thinking about how much Suki helped me when Jason left and every time Chris broke my heart. How much I looked at her and Gaber and just thought to myself, ""If I can be half as happy as they are, my world would be perfect."" Then I looked at Kaji who had his arm around me carrying the pound of fudge we had been eating and in that moment... I realized that I had reached the happiness I had been looking for and figured out that happiness wasn't a destination, it's the journy, it's how it makes you feel, and being with Kaji made me happy no matter what was going on. Then I looked at Happy, who by now was being carried by Hutch up the hill cuz her feet were hurting. I saw Happy and I wanted to help her the same way Suki help me though those tough times. Greatfully I learned that my theory of what happened was wrong. Hutch wasn't leaving, Happy was just having one of those nights where things that build up just come pouring out. As Hutch's mom picked him up, I sat by Happy and told hear what happened. She assured me that her tears had nothing to do with Hutch, and I was relieved. But I still felt like Suki because of the willingness I had to help Happy. 

I've been helped many times in my life, and I aspire to be like those who helped me, and when I have reached that goal, it is one of the best moments in my life. Thanks Suki, for being such a great example."

So at the start of this week, it felt like it was going to kill me to be apart from Kaji for so long, but in the end it was good. I got to hang out with people I wouldn't normally chill with anymore, like Happy and Noodles. It did feel like an eternity being separated from Kaji, and I missed him terribly, but it gave me a chance to think. Now I wont tell you what I was thinking right now because I'm tired, it's past 1am and I need sleep.

Anyways. Kaji's off to Florida in a few hours. He couldn't find a suitcase to put me into, so he couldn't take me with him. 6 days with no Kaji. How will I ever survive? Lol. Jk. He said he was taking Mr. Whistles though. That made me happy. Means he will miss me. And I always take Mr. Flopples wherever I go. Gonna be a weird 6 days without Kaji around. He said he'd email me when he got there, and call me as soon as he got home. So Friday I should be hearing from him. ^_^ That'll be nice. Saturday we'll probably go to the Outdoor Cinema if he feels up to it. And my wrist will be all tweeked...

I go in for sergery on Wednesday. Oh yippy skippy... I'm kinda nervous. I'm happy that this is finally getting taken care of, but still. I've avoided sergery for 17 years, magically. Lol. Wish me luck!!

Like I want to put up a barrier so he can't come close to me. because I know it has to end at some time because our lives are going two separate paths and even if we did have the 1/100 highschool relationship that lasted, we couldn't be together. No matter how hard we tried. I'm afraid to fall inlove with him because I know it's just going to hurt. *sigh* The feeling in my heart is both fear and unconditional love.

Same thing happened to Kaji. HE GOT MAD AT ME! Not like MAD, but still agitated and SHOWED EMOTION! I was stoked.... even if it was a negitive thing... oh well he still showed emotion!!!! I was surprised but very happy. it doesn't make him happy that i go to Chris' and it makes him feel worse that I talk to Chris when I'm having a problem. He says he'd rather I talk to Ali, not Chris. Normally I would be like, ""yeah right dude, you can kiss my ass."" but I thought about it and I was like, ""Yeah, if he had an ex girlfriend and he talked to her about something going on in our relationship, I wouldn't be to happy, and I wouldn't be happy if he went over to her house so often."" So I see where he's comming from and I'm going to try to talk to him more instead of Chris. It will strengthen our relationship, and make Kaji happy. Even if I sound like an idiot, I'm going to talk to him. Cuz it's important to me, and because he loves me it's important to him. ... I hope."

"event","I write this update, not to take back what I said yesterday, but to add to it. 

I know not wither I will be happy or sad that I am and will remain true to my word and promise I made to Kaji. Though right now I seem glad of it, at times I wish I had never made it. I'm still not quite sure about alot of things. Last night I was so sure of the regret I felt for originally asking Kaji out. But now... I'm not so sure. Is it because I am afraid to hurt people. I hate to hurt people. Is that why I keep this promise? Is this love I feel for either of them actual love? or is it just the loving of a friend. I know not. I know that I am drawn to Chris for reasons unbeknownst to me. But I am bound to Kaji through love, what type I do not know, and also through that promise I made. 

Today I felt like crap. I saw Kaji and wanted to disapear. How could I face him with this after all his done for me? ... that reminded me of all that he has done for me. Even more I wanted to disapear. Expecially after the 20 minute break. I kissed him good bye, but the way I kissed him, completely emotionless, he knew something was wrong. As I turned away he grabed my backpack and caused me to turn back towards him. ""What's wrong?"" he asked sternly. What could I do, I didn't want to be seen by him so I lied and said, ""Nothing, I just... don't feel good."" Which isn't all a lie, I didn't feel good, but it was more than that. I walked away and wanted to cry. I still don't know for what cause did I need to cry. Was it that even though he doesn't know what's going on that I feel like I'm hurting him, or was it because I cannot love Chris? It might have been possible that I cried because I knew I had lied to Kaji, and I knew that he knew it was a lie. When I don't feel good I normally want hugs... today was different. I didn't. 

So all in all, with my rantings of this, I cannot do anything. It is almost pointless to even post this, but it does make me fell at least a little better if nothing else."

"event","What do you do when you're naping with someone... but you're dreaming of someone else? Everything I did this weekend reminded me of him. I don't know why, but being out on the Zodiac (when Kaji wasn't constantly around me) gave me a chance to clear my head. Have you ever noticed that it's only the natural beauty that can do that? There's a picture I took that reminds me of how I'm feeling. On the one side of the picture the water is blue, on the other it's a greenish tinge. Both are beautiful, but which is better?

When I saw the orca breach, I put myself into it as it freely fell backwards into the water, being free in the air for that split moment. Free. This is a word I know nothing of for my heart is as free as a panther is white. 

What do I want? I don't know, my heart is bound to one until the time comes that I find something wrong with the relationship. But every time I find something wrong... he fixes it. I'm clawing my way out of this cage, unable to love the man I so long ago fell in love with, and who still owns my heart. I claw as hard as I can, but to no avail, my claws have shriveled down to none. 

My will is not as strong as it once was. I promised him I would not break through this cage because of reasons past. But they are the claws that I need to break free. They are the only ones that can be used for such a thing. Tears mean nothing to this promise. As I shed tears of pain and defeat, and for the longing for the love from a man I am forced to deny my love for. The agony, the sorrow I suffer. 

Why do I put up with it? Because of that promise! Oh how much I lothe and despise that promise I made! And yet... I keep it. Loyal to my word, I keep it. But what can be done? There's not that I haven't thought, though they may have be those that were so surely crushed by this, this... damned two worded phrase. But they still linger. Though the thought has been chrushed, for reasons I know not, I cannot relinquish them. They take hold over every part of me and strangle me. Causing me to tremble at their site. My heart torn apart at the sight and the very memory that for the world, I could not love him. For the world, was I able to, I would give it up for the chance of being able to cure this disease.

I know not what to say, I know not what to think. All I know is that my heart can bairly stand this much longer. I fear I will go mad with all of this burning inside me. I cannot tell him no... he would go silent and never speak another word of it. He would think of it day after day, but never speak to me about it. If I could actually talk to Kaji, maybe I would tell him... 

I've told Chris. I don't know why. I cannot love him, I'm not allowed to, but yet I needed to talk to someone... and out of all.. I told Chris. He is my best friend, I go to him with everything. I just wish I could go to him for love."

I guess I'm still in the mindset that I just don't believe that anyone can love me as much as I hope they Do. But that changed when he was asked how much he said, ""Love can't be measured."" Measure it in water droplets. ""An ocean."" This was a few months ago. And then today was weird because I missed him more than usual, and then he said, ""Last night I didn't want you do leave strangely more then other days."" That made me feel really special. I said, ""I never like leaving you."" He replied, ""Neither do I. Just more than usual this time."" ^_^ It made me feel super special. I... I dunno... I just ^_^. yeah I guess that's all I can write... It just feels so good to be wanted... to be needed. I love you Kaji."

On a not so great matter, Kaji's not feeling so great. I went over to his house today before I went to Jony's to work and he was burning up. I wanted to stay there and take care of him, but I had to work and his family was there to take care of him, even though his mom and dad were both sick with food poisoning. Kate was the only one not sick. I tried calling him later today after I called Franky, but they didn't pick up. I'm going to assume that they were sleeping trying to get better. I told Kaji to put a cold washcloth on his forehead to try and cool him off from his fever. One time I got sick from food poisoning and I was sick for almost a week, and it honestly felt like I was going to die. This is probably the same thing, but I still don't like him being sick. I wish I could make him better, or atleast just stay with him and take care of him till he's better. I hope Kaji feels better soon."

"event","So after reaching that point with Kaji yesterday I decided to go back and reread my entries starting from when Kaji and I first got together. Lots of crap happened then in our relationship. Chris screwed with it, I screwed with it. There was just alot of mistakes. And as I read over a few I wondered to myself, HOW THE HELL WAS I SO STUPID!? I mean honestly, how could I even love Chris that long? He never huged me, something I can't survive without, he wouldn't even look at me. He never spoke to me and he was just HORRIBLE! I was always crying because of him, and everything was just wrong. How could I have ever thought I'd be happier with Chris? I cried more often than I laughed or even smiled. I always had this horrible feeling, and his paranoia was affecting me. Chris didn't even support me in what I wanted to do even though he KNEW why and UNDERSTOOD everything. KAJI DOES! That just doesn't make sense. Theoretically Chris should be the gentleman and Kaji the asshole. Luckily that theory is wrong, either that or this situation would be very different. Ah well, the point I""m trying to make is, I WAS STUPID! Lol. That's basically it. Cya"

Help her live the way she wants and needs to live? how the hell can you say, ""I love you."" if you do that. >.< !!!! Grrr! Men make me angry sometimes... no all the time! Gentlemen don't make me angry, men do. 'Tis sad that the Gentleman Species is dying. I don't like new aged men, I'd rather have a gentleman than an asshole. 

So a note to all you assholes out there... *clears throught* You will live a very lonely life if you don't straighten up! *glares!*

"event","Our relationship, as strong as it is... stands on the edge of a damasteel katana. Kaji and I are both afraid that me still loving Chris will ruin what we have. I don't want that to happen. I want to be over him so I can have a good relationship with Kaji. We spent nearly all of today together. We went to Boulevard and froze. Lol. It was great. We just kind walked around either hand in hand or with our arms around eachother. It felt great. I haven't been this happy in a long time. I was realaxed and I wasn't constantly looking over my shoulder. I was just happy to be there with him... where ever ""there"" was. ^_^. We went back to his house after getting ice cream and watched House of Flying Daggers. Greaaaat movie! Anyways, afterwards, I felt like I was going to cry as Kaji and I talked about the one thing that could tear us apart...

""I why can't I love only you?""
""Wouldn't that be nice.""
""I wish I did.""
""Me too.""
""I want to... What do you want me to do?""
""Kill him.""
""That's llegal.""
""What can you do?""
""I dunno.""
""Exactly.""
""What do you wish would happen?""
""You get over him.""
""I'm trying.""
""Try harder.""
""I think him being gone for a week is good. Maybe this will tip the scale.""
""I doubt it.""
""One can hope.""
""One can dream.""
""All realities begin with a dream... I'm with you, not him. I could be, but I'm not.""
*hugs*
""One day I'll be over him, and anything I have left for him I'll lock away and feed to my dragons, then they'll have a feast.""
""We have to get there first.""
""We'll get there, I promise. Then when we do, I'll be all yours.""
""Yesss!""
""I love you, I want to love you, not him.""
""I love you too.""
""I know. *hugs* I just wish I loved you as much as you love me.""
""So do I."""

"event","Hey everyone, this is just the start of something I've been working on for a while. In my head ofcourse. Lol. Well anyways, it's just the first scene. If I used your name, it's only because I think that that will fit the character. It has nothing to do with you. I have to go to Muay Thai now, so I'll add more later.

<lj-cut text=""Just something I'm working on"">

Screams.
She froze as she steped out of the shower. 
Gun shot.
In the purest of silence, she put her clothes on. Moments went by as if they were an eternity. What happend? Who were they? Questions raced through her mind like a meteor shower. She dare not turn the fan off for fear they would hear. Her breath slowed and shallowed. They could be right outside the door. She hugged the wall behind the door as if she were high up on a skyscraper holding onfor dear life.

A noise outside the bathroom door startled her. Her eye blazed with fear as she slowly lowered herself to the floor. ""Check ever room!"" She heard a voice call. The door knob to the bathroom jiggled, ""It's locked!"" She held her breath, for how long, she didn't know. ""Leave it,"" the first man called, ""If she had been in the shower or been in there we would have heard the water running. Let's go."" 

She heard the footsteps vanish untill finally she heard the front door close behind them. Afraid to move, Emily sat on the foor for longer than she knew. She was afraid to step outside for fear of what had happened. What was the shot for? Who else was in the house? ""Oh no!"" she gasped, her mother had been watching TV in the living room. Suddenly she began to weep. She held her face in her hand and cried untill a small puddle had formed below her. 

Finally she got up enough courage to face the horror that awaited her. Her hair still dripping from her shower, she entered the living room. The blood from her mother's lifeless body oozed and stained the carpet. Her face seemed to be frozen in time. The look of horror Emily saw on her mother's face was enough to make her turn her head. 

Emily found the phone and called 911. As she waited she also feared the those responsible for this would return tonight to finish off what they started. Why had they attacked her in the first place? She didn't know. Her mother had had no enimies that she knew of. She pondered on these things untill she heard a knock at the door. She froze. ""It's the Police,"" she heard a familiar voice call. Emily went for the pep-hole to make sure. To her surprise and happiness she opened the door to a very dear friend, Joseph DeLaCruz. He came inside and saw what Emily's mother lying on the floor. ""What happend!?"" was the first thing he said. 

""I don't know. Some men, I don't know who, came in and just shot her,"" Emily replied.
 
""But they didn't shoot you?"" Joe's puzzlement could be heard in his voice.

""I was in the shower, and had turned off the water and stepped out right as they opened the door... they didn't hear me and the door was locked so I guess they assumed it had been locked by accident and that I wasn't home,"" she replied.

""They assumed you'd be home then?"" Joe asked.

""I guess so. Does that make a difference?""

Joe rose to his feet after looking at Emily's mother. ""It means,"" he began, ""that you were their target.""

A look of horror and surprise shot across Emily's face, ""No! That can't be! Why would they...?!"" Emily staggered backwards until she hit the wall. 

""Emily,"" Joe motioned towards her to try to calm her, but Emily sunk to the floor with that same look for horror on her face that he mother held. Without hesitation, Joe quickly went over to Emily and put his hands on her shoulders. Her face lifted up towards him, ""Listen to me. It's not your fault.""

Tears raced down Emily's face as she stared at her mother's body. She looked up at Joe, ""But they were after me,"" She cried.

""I know, but that doesn't make it your fault,"" he assured her. Joe wraped his arms around Emily as she sobbed tears of hate, regret, saddness and anger. 


Sitting, the one thing Emily didn't want to do. She didn't know who those men were and didn't know if they'd be watching the house. She wanted to run, run away from this city so they'll never find her, but Joe said that running wasn't a good idea. ""It would be safer if you stayed so we can keep an eye on you,"" is what he had said. 

Emily sat in the police station for hours as Joe tried to convince his boss to let Emily stay at his house. Emily was great friends with his entire family. His wife, Jean, was a person Emily looked up to with all her 16 year old heart, and Justin, Joe's son was Emily's best friend. Though they had had a thing for eachother a few years back, that had ended, but their friendship had only gotten stronger. Emily knew that she would be safe at their house.

""You are to close to this girl,"" she heard Sherriff Williams say.

""That just means I'll take better care of her,"" Joe protested. ""Where else are you going to send her, to her sister's? They'll just look for her there! They wouldn't think of looking at my house! Even if they do, I'm a cop, I can protect her.""

After a few more minutes of debating, Emily was glad to hear the Sherriff finally say, ""Alright, she can stay with you."" This made Emily smile for the first time the entire evening. She knew nothing would happen to her now.</lj-cut>"

I think this poem is apropriate...

Upon the stars I rest, 
My mind in my dreams.  
Your voice comes, 
""I love you,"" it sings. 
Oh the sweetness of day, 
I oft have thought, 
when our eyes have met, 
And words have not. 
My heart skips a beat, 
As the warm rays surround, 
You look upon my face, 
And a smile is found. 
Oh how the stars have blessed, 
What a joy they give, 
When heaven gave me you, 
What sweetness it is to live."

"event","So this is the 4th time I've gotten this .... head ache? and it lasts days... this is day 2. It feels like someone is stabbing through my temple and trying to pop out my left eye... and it hurts like hell... I've tried Ib Profin and a few other drugs, but nothings worked... Grrr... I hate this... it sucks.

Another thing. So I haven't been sleeping well lately... not fun. I've had this nightmare.. I guess.. and it's just horrible. But since I finally figured things out with ----- 2 days ago... I've slept pretty well and had dreams that are... goodish.. I guess. I still feel kind weird, but I feel ALOT better. I still feel bad for living somewhat of a lie, but I don't really have a choice. As long as that hope stays alive, then I'll be happy. If it closes, then I become as a few of my past entries have been.. if you didn't read them, I don't blame you. Lol. But yeah. I'm lost better because we worked things out. ^_^. Well I'm off to bed now. G'night."

Board games, our place, 7:30PM, Friday 18th February.
We'll have nibbles. You bring whatever you like to drink. We're thinking pizza for dinner (Crust Pizza or something local).

Which boardgames will depend on number of people, mood and a dose of just plain random.

If you're interested just reply and I'll get our address to you.

Depressing as hell but it can't be helped.

So, if you're interested in going, or know someone who is interested, we have 2 tickets that need a home.
Maybe not free, but I'd rather they made someone happy than went to waste.

For friends, we can even offer accommodation if you're from out of town.


In other news, I'm planning on posting photos and impressions of our holiday. Just have to get around to it.

"event","Well technically day two, since we arrived yesterday. But all we did is get to the hotel, have some dinner and crash.

Actually, since I'm on free wireless, I'll cover the back story.

First leg of the flight was to Seoul on Korean Airlines. It was actually a good flight. The in-flight entertainment system was pretty comprehensive but lost out to scrabble on the iPad. It's been years since I played scrabble, I'd forgotten how much I loved it. We also watched a French film :)
The layover in Seoul was ok, but their idea of 5star was well under mine. Dinner was ok but cold and small (that's what you get for free I guess).

Next morning, up early in the freezing cold and back to the airport for our Air France flight to Paris. Enjoyed the free wireless at Incheon Airport. The flight to Paris seemed a bit more ""budget"" than the first. Read a lot, bushes up on some French. Was chuffed when they served rather nice cheese with the in-flight meal.
We flew over China and Siberia en route. They had a down-facing camera you could watch. So I can say I've seen Siberia and Mongolia ;)
When we hit Paris we waited for a hour while the shuttle bus waited for other passengers that never showed.

After checking in we went to the hotel restaurant, Hippopotomus (seriously). My French failed me utterly. I was like a deer in headlights. I had no idea what they were saying and no idea how to respond. Fortunately my other half kept her presence of mind and managed to get the ideas across. Eventually the waiter asked if he should use English and I gratefully said yes.
It turns out I don't deal at all well with the language barrier.

Hence, here we sit in Macdonalds where we can order with the bare minimum of communication. They also have free Internet though, which rocks.

This morning we embarked on a long walk through Le (la?) Parc des Buttes Chaumont. It's a stunning park, steep hills lead down to a lake with a rock spire in the centre complete with a gazebo and very impressive views. I might see about uploading some pictures.

The Cite de Sciences is a stone's throw from our hotel and has a science fiction exhibition on but alas it was closed (as most museums in Paris are on Mondays). We have that one pegged as a must-visit after the tour. We did walk around the building in the frickin' freezing morning. It has a giant, reflective metal geodesic sphere that looks damned impressive and ,um, plays a serious of little musical jingles. Oh, and it houses an IMAX theater apparently. I should upload some photos of that too :)

Tomorrow, the tour starts. Looking forward to setting out on that big adventure but also really looking forward to getting back to Paris. There's just SO much we want to see here.

Hopefully, I can also make some progress with this language problem.

"event","For those not in the loop - World of Warcraft recently underwent a massive patch as the first step towards releasing the next expansion on the 7th Dec.

Firstly, it was Gigs in size. 6.5 or so and rumour has it there will be another 1.5Gig of patch patching for when I get home.
That's frickin' huge in anyone's language. I take that as proof all the ""we don't need national broadband upgrades of any kind"" crowd had their heads in the sand.
The scientists haven't told everyone yet, but data actually has sex when you're not looking and makes little data babies. When they grow up all of a sudden your data file is 10 times bigger than it used to be. Trust me on this, I see the end result of the randy little buggers every damned day.

Secondly, some utter moron at Blizzard thought it would be a fantastic idea to let the game start BEFORE all the data was downloaded.  Seriously.
So what happens is in game when you try to go somewhere it hasn't downloaded/updated yet everything stops dead whilst it catches up.  Really, it does that. That would be OK because one can just refrain from playing (even thought it would let one) until the download is complete. EXCEPT that we're talking an MMO here and one can't rely on the OTHER players being so restrained.
So you end up sitting around in-game twiddling your virtual thumbs whilst THEY finish updating.
If I meet the fool who thought it up, and/or the fools who approved it, I have some choice words to download into their craniums.

Thirdly, the patch has heavily altered the way the game plays. Yet, people in game (when you finally get to start playing rather than twiddling) seem even LESS patient when things go a little south.  Had a warrior tank just drop group last night after he died a second time due to his pulling every damned thing in sight and me not being able to keep up with the healing. Even for a gnome that was inexcusable - and I give gnomes a lot of leeway just because they're awesome.
More than once I've wondered if my addiction to WoW as a hobby is some kind of masochistic manifestation of anti-misanthropy.

I rarely have to watch it all because it's so indellibly imprinted on my memory.

It's sad that one of the driving forces behind what brought me that experience (and it was no mean feat at the time) has passed away. Death is such a waste.

Really. Fucking. Tired.

I've bought and/or used my fair share of computers and phones both from Apple and from other companies. Out of all of them Apple's have been, by and large, better. Not perfect (don't get me started on the phone capability of the iPhone) but better. They're generally more robust, more user friedly and more attractive. Yes, appearance matters.

Given my generally positive experience, I recommend said products to friends where appropriate (except for the obvious Apple opponents). I figure that's how word-of-mouth is supposed to work. I have a good experience so I pass that on to the people I care about, to help them navigate the river of lies that is advertising.
It really gets my goat when I do that only to have it thrown in my face that I'm some kind of sycophant.

I have my opinions on *why* Apple products are generally better and I'll happily share them if only to make conversation. Increasingly though that seems to be an invitation to have myself beaten about the head with tired internet memes and media soundbytes. 

Ease up a little. I don't worship Apple but I do give them first consideration based entirely on previous, positive experiences. I think I'm allowed to do that without having to be lumped in with the raving loonies."

To my surprise, today I stumbled across a short story written as a sequel by Peter Watts: <a href=""http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/"">The Things</a>.

It's good. Damned good.  It takes the story from the film and manages to both extend it thoughtfully <i>and</i> turn it on it's head.  It was a joy to read. IT makes me wonder, though, whether some inherent craftsmanship in the film/script lent itself to this kind of treatment after the fact, or is it all in the skill of the short story writer to find the nooks and crannies in the original piece where he can work his magic.

If you've seen the film, I recommend reading the short story. If you haven't seen the film let me know - I'm happy to organise a viewing :)

It's worth noting I have read ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Goes_There%3F"">Who Goes There?</a>"" (the story the film is based on) and seen the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044121/"">even older film adaption</a>.

Oracle's spin is all angled at a kind of partnership or ""elder brother"" relationship with Sun.  More like Big Brother.  As you can see, Sun's web site is no more at the high levels.  Deep links occasionally still resemble the old site but most are heavily Oracle-ified.
Worst than that is the rebranding.  ""Sun Solaris"" became ""Oracle Solaris"", ""Sun SPARC"" became ""ORacle SPARC"" and so on. All on the very day of the takeover.

The clincher for me was when the Sun BigAdmin newsletter arrived newly entitled ""Oracle BigAdmin"".
It seems clear now that Oracle will be crushing the Sun brand under its boot.

Sun had really lost their way, so for things like Solaris and SPARC, this is about the only real chance they have. However, it's sad to see the Sun brand mercilessly stripped away. For their part in the dotcom boom, if not for Solaris and their general devotion to innovation, Sun deserve to not be completely forgotten.

"event","So I've been reading the ABC web site news a bit lately - mostly procrastinating at work. Which means I tend to trawl through all the comment threads. I really have to stop doing that, it's depressing.

This whole ""Right vs Left"" thing not only has aspects of a holy war, but the ""definitions"" of the two terms are so rubbery as to be useless. Anyone calling Rudd's government ""leftie"" is in need of a serious reality check. Is Australia really dying to sign itself up for a religious, fascist regime? There sure as hell seems to be a slow but inexorable slide in that direction.

On top of that, the AGW denialist crowd are usually the same caustic, rabid arseholes that worship Howard, Abbott and their ilk. I suppose that's because in a two-party system such as we have, the ""choice"" is essentially arbitrary when taken across a range of topics.
I've tried looking into the science.  But it is science after all - I can't follow it in depth. There's so damned much of it: Glacial studies, tree-ring studies, weather, geology, chemistry, astrophysics... It's totally unreasonable to expect the average person to make a truly ""informed"" decision based on work spread across many fields over many years.  That's why we need trusted third parties to boil it down for us.
Sadly though, that makes it easy for the denialists to just attack our doubts and uncertainties. Which they do, frequently without response from the other side. They're always vague, non-specific attacks which makes them hard to respond to in any meaningful way. I feel this urge to follow up with a mass of references, but I know how those conversations go on the internet.

In the end, for me, it comes down to this.  If there is AGW and we do nothing, things are going to get <b>very</b> fucked up.  If there isn't AGW and we expend effort in reducing our emissions and reducing our energy usage, we'll at least have gained efficiency and reduced pollution. The latter seems like the sane risk to take.

Abbott's cabinet reads like a whos-who of scarey and crazy. Yet people will vote for that bunch at the next election. Seriously, I can't even begin to fathom the thinking behind that decision. I'm also afraid to research the thinking behind it for fear I'll be tainted by what I find.

This always happens when I start getting too involved in politics. I suppose, in that, is the answer as to why so many people refuse to engage with what should be important issues to everyone. It involves taking a swim in the darkest, foulest waters any of us can imagine: the thoughts of people we can't understand. I'm not talking anything as cliche as the Hollywood carricature of a serial killer or psychopath either but the jumble of complex contradictions, confusions, insecurities and sheer normality that lurks in everyone.

Much smaller than either of the Brisbane equivalents (BMFAT and <A HREF=""http://www.abbeytournament.com/home.htm"">Abbey Medieval Festival</A>) but that's a plus in terms of not having so many people to plow through. Mind you, it also means the re-enactment groups are much smaller too.
We arrived at 9:20ish which is apparently far too early even in semi-rural Victoria ;) They were still setting up and arriving.  Though, it meant we had a nice meander about the camps and stalls that were set up whilst it was still a little cool. Once the heat kicked in (and boy, did it ever) I basically camped in the shade and watched the events.
I reached the conclusion that whilst i have a vague interest in things both medieval and martial, it doesn't extend to spending a hot day in armour entertaining crowds. That counts that out as a passtime.

I'm impressed that I managed to spend 4+ hours largely in the sun and didn't get sunburnt. Huzzah!
By the time we left though I was distinctly heat-addled. Consequently, Sunday was spent at home despite having other activities planned. The sun and I, we do not get on.

Mind you, I've never really had an urge to learn to dance, so maybe I'm just making shit up. I love the song though :)

"event","We've been watching Heroes Season 3, which has reminded me how much I love Heroes.

A lot of people didn't like Heroes much and I have a theory :)

I've always had a soft-spot for the Superhero genre. Something to do with the blithe disregard for natural limitations Quixotically supported by scientific principles. It gets into my head and stokes up the Ideas Engine. So I jumped on Heroes when I first heard about it on TV.

Hated it.  Too damned slow; the plot crawled like molasses and jumped around like an ADHD bumblebee. Then, on a whim, we got the whole first series and watched it back-to-back over about 4 nights. I got more hooked than I have on just about any other series. Watching them in a one big glut really brought out the plot, the characters and the sheer potential of the genre.

See, the fantasy genre shares the same broad potential but it's hidden under a layer of poorly understood (from the reader/viewer's perspective) mechanics of the magic and social ""systems"" that are in play.  With the superhero genre you start from a well known base of pop-science and society; it's like a launchpad for pondering alternatives.

Despite loving superheroes, I don't collect comics.  I've tried, so I have a few, but I hate the tiny dribs and drabs of story they represent.  Too slow, too long a wait between fixes.
Until I bought some of the big anthologies of back-issues (X-Men, as it happens).  I ate them up, I think for the same reason. Big dose in one go.

So, yeah. There's my half-baked theory. If you hated Heroes on TV, try it in a bigger dose."

"event","Oh boy do I have some <lj-cut text=""spoiler filled opinions about this one."">spoiler filled opinions about this one.

I'm a massive fan of post apocalypsic settings, and Terminator Salvation delivers that very well indeed.  Everything from wasteland, to ruined cities, to evidence of man almost entirely concealed by nature's return. The look and feel was quite authentic (and a little bit Fallout, truth be told).

I also rather like my nasty robots going on a rampage.  Got a fair bit of that too.

What I didn't get was an original contribution to the story. Or believable characters. Or any kind of plot twists. Or an ending (since it lacked any kind of tale to end). It didn't even really have obvious hooks into a sequel - resting entirely on the first film to establish any potential for sequels.

There are two developed characters in this film. Worthington's human/terminator hybrid and Moon Bloodgood's very human resistance fighter. The latter was essentailly cast aside when her character and significance to the theme was made apparent.
Yes, I said theme.  There was an attempt at a theme of humans becoming like the machines, but the characters and the plot make these half-hearted efforts at demonstrating that theme, then John Connor makes a speech to make it all so obvious I wanted to scream, then it just gets dropped.  Wasted opportunity.
Bloodgood's character understood and showed that she knew what it was to stay human, stay loyal to humanity, but she drops out of the film.  Huh? She should be beside Connor from that point on as someone he can trust to keep him, and others, human.  Not to mention keep the theme alive in the film.

There's no real tension.  You know Worthington is some kind of double-agent right from the opening scene. Even the tension of waiting for him to stab them in the back is dissipated when he just rips out his ""controller"" chip and pokes his tongue at Skynet (well, not literally).
Whilse we're at that point - VILLIANS LIKE SKYNET DO NOT NEED A HUMAN FACE.  For fuck's sake! Trust me when I say a relentless, inhuman,  omnipresent but invisible all powerful opponent is a lot more scary than Helena Bonham Carter. It's not even a competition.  I had very unpleasant flashbacks the the ""reveal"" of the ""Borg collective"" leader in First Contact. It made me angry.

I loved that they threw in the Arnie look-alike/CGI sequence. Then the Arnie terminator goes all ""gonna just chuck you around until you die, not terminate you where you stand like I should"". WTF? Lame! Then they take the ""homages"" to the first film way too far by reconstructing scenes.  It was more like flashbacks, which was disconcerting. Does Hollywood hire different people to direct the action scenes? So often character and plot are cast out the window in the face of drawn-out, stupid ""action"" sequences that serve no purpose but to slow the film and stretch believability at the same time.

oh, and plot holes. Skynet knows Kyle Reese is Connor's father? So why doesn't the terminator in the first film just go after him instead of Sarah?  Takes two to tango, as the saying goes.  Killing either one takes John Connor out of the picture. Of course if you drop that plot hole, the entire plot (such as it is) unravels completely.

Personally, I think a more poignant ending would have been John Connor with a mechanical heart.

I love the first film because it _is_ a simple story. Even with the time travel it makes a tigh, closed loop that requires a bit of thought to find holes in (that require speculation about how time travel might work anyway). The second film was mostly rubbish, but had some nice details.  Sarah Connor's new character, snippets of the future, and the realisation that the terminator was as much fatehr to skynet as Reese was to Connor. And then there was 3 and it all goes to shit.

I still think I could do it all better. At least in terms of general plot.

"event","Now that I've seen it, my take on Star Trek 11 <lj-cut text=""behind the cut."">behind the cut.

I was originally not going to see it.  Star Trek movies have been, on the whole, utter rubbish (""Wrath of Khan"" is one of my favourite films, ""The Voyage Home"" and ""First Contact"" I'll sit in front of, the rest I avoid). Talk of a ""reboot"" was broad and similar enough to smack of marketing hype, and J J Abrams has been involved with enough truly awful rubbish (Lost, Armageddon, Cloverfield) that my initial reaction was to run, screaming. In the end, my OCD need for Sci-Fi and a desire to encourage the genre dragged me out to see it. In all reality, any loyalty I had for the Star Trek franchise died around about the advent of Voyager (though not because of it).

In broad strokes, I think ST11: 
<ul>
<li>is a fantastic projection of the Star Trek Original Series characters back to their youth.</li>
<li>is a story of roughly the same (lack of) quality as the majority of the Star Trek films</li>
<li>was directed with all the subtlety of an angry two year old</li>
<li>is more proof that temporal contraception of George Lucas would do us all a favour</li>
</ul>

And now in more detail:

The characters were true to how I envisioned Kirk et. al. to have been a few years prior to the original series. Kirk is your typical reckless kid with a chip on his shoulder and just enough smarts to pull it off without dying. He shows all the tenacity (or stupidity) that was the defining feature of the character, and is portrayed well enough in most respects. Pike's reasoning for elevating Kirk to his position as Captain is vaguely plausible (and certainly one of the few scenarios that could see such a hot-head in such a position).
Spock is also well acted. I especially like that he is more emotional and rebellious than in the original series; it goes a long way to defining some common ground that his friendship with Kirk can be built on (very well illustrated in the final stages of the film).
Bones and Sulu are also well done, though Bones' role takes a back seat to the film plot which I think undervalues his friendship with Kirk.
Checkov's accent was awful, apparently as a homage. I think it was even MORE overdone and distracting, which was a shame. If you're going to ""update"" the franchise then ditch the dumb accent.
Simon Pegg's Scotty didn't quite ring true to me - too ADHD. Funny, but not quite what I'd expected. He was, however, essential in that he gave the film some funny moments that <i>weren't</i> a direct result of the awful plot and stupid ""science"".

The story?  Some time-travelling loonatic is hell-bent on repeated use of an ultimate weapon in pursuit of a personal vendetta and only our heroes can stop him. <b>YAWN!!!</b> ""Wrath of Khan"" did it so much better it's tough to draw the comparison. At least in Khan, the writer acknowledged that a plot like that is about the characters, not the plot.  ST11 is plot driven and so all the emotion is drained away to oblivion, leaving Eric Bana's character looking like a cartoon character.
It seems to me the time-travelling aspect of it all was simply there as a cheap excuse to ignore all the previous continuity work and to have Leonard Nimoy make an appearance - a cheap attempt to link it to the series they're trying hard to divorce themselves from. In the end, that just leaves what should be a major aspect of the story merely a footnote.
The writing suffers from the same kind of lazy ignorance of what's gone before that plagues long-running franchises. Why is a Romulan mining ship bristling with weaponry? Why does it look nothing like any previous depictions of Romulan ships? Why do the ""black holes"" just vanish once they've achieved their plot-defined amount of destruction? Why is Spock so happy to leave the time-lines fucked up when it means his homeworld is gone, his best friend lost his father without ever having met him, and he's stranded in the ""wrong"" timeline?
I know there are comics.  Don't get me started on using cheap, off-hand comic series to explain away easily rectified plot holes.

The direction was just bad. The use of heavy handed (and we're talking dwarf-star alloy heavy handed) music at key plot point was just funny. I literally laughed out loud when Kirks father valiantly sacrificed his life to save hundereds of others - that's not right. When the villain receives his just deserts, I just wanted the damned film to end.  I mean really, choral music?  May as well play Amazing Grace every time Wile E Coyote buys the farm. All of the shots were cluttered and claustrophobic, making the Enterprise seem tiny.  Which is going to make things rough on it's upcoming ""5 year mission"".

George fucking Lucas has much to answer for as the apparent source of inspiration for much of the space and alien scenes. Too many ""cantina"" alien flashbacks, too many cluttered and claustrophobic space battles, and yet another irrelevant sequence of crappy CGI predators eating each other and yet failing to eat any characters.
The Enterprise looked like a tinker-toy next to the ridiculous looking Romulan mining vessel.  All the ships liked to siddle right up next to each other, because space isn't big or anything. Every ship cut loose with 15 billion guns firing in all directions. Functional alien devices had superfluous ""spikey bits"" or un-railed platforms that made no sense.
Fuck you, George Lucas, and the horse you rode in on.

</lj-cut>

The short version:
If my love of Star Trek hadn't already been utterly betrayed and compromised by years of abuse, this film would have left me a frothing lunatic with a penchant for murder.  As it is I'll just settle for continuing my search for sci-fi that doesn't suck."

Anyway, so now we're laying plans of having lives again. There's so much coming up - Gary Numan, food festival, comedy festival, friends visiting. We still have almost all of Melbourne to see and all the bits we can get to from Melbourne.  It's a bit overwhelming really.
If anyone has suggestions regarding whats worth seeing/doing they will be well received :)

On the work front I've managed to get myself embroiled in a personality clash between two other people - one of which I get on with, the other of which I have to work with closely to do my job. Talk about awkward. Me being me I of course blundered right into the situation before I had any idea. Now I have to find some way to extricate myself without offending either person. Fun.

I've also been battling with my confidence. I know I got the job because I wanted to be expanding my skills and getting away from only doing the things I already knew. And I know they gave me the job knowing that I wasn't bringing a truckload of experience in the actual position. But the current economic situation just makes me acutely aware of how well I do everything, and nervous about how it's received. Oh well, I'll get over it I'll get the arse I guess :)
I'm still wrapping my head around the private sector thinking of money before clients. At Uni they generally carry equal weight but where I am now, it's about money and those things that give you money. What were they again?  Popple?  Pepple?  Something like that.

P.S. Except for the awful fires and the weather that caused them, loving it here in Melbourne."

"event","<p>Yesterday was all introductions and HR reading, with a little taste of what I'm in for towards the end.<br />For now it looks like I'll be spending my time trying to wrap my head around a new server and service environment. Which means a lot of trawling through not-quite-accurate documentation.<br />Fortunately, it's all so novel that I'm actually looking forward to it. <br />I wonder when the ""new job buzz"" generally wears off (probably the first time I screw something up:)</p><p><em><small>Posted via <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/cosysoftware_en/"">LiveJournal.app</a>.</small></em></p>"

"event","Leigh and I lit Bradferd's popcorn on fire during lunch. It kept smoking for a while (after the flame died down) and Brad smells like burnt popcorn now. I don't know why he decided to stuff it in his lunchbox. It was pretty... exciting.

 I've decided that if we ever have an actual fire we are going to die, because the fire alarm didn't go off at all. Heehee...

 Weekend! So relieved. *-* I'm gonna listen to some good music, get lost inside my head, and pratice projection! 

 *flops to the floor*
 Oww.
 I'll clean my rooom first."

 Worried about the report card... Kind of. EVERYONE did terrible this marking period. @___@

 I'd like to write that I'm being ultra-productive and using my young life and reaching for the stars, etc etc, but I'm not. :P I should really go do something interesting. I think... I shall meditate. :O"

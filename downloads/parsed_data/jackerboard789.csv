 i mean..i know im not like obese..but i want to get my abes to like steal!! lol..

my brother leaves for iraq the first week of march//:( :(
im ganna miss him so much
alot of shit has been going on in my life latley, and hes been there for support, whenever i needed to call him...
i wont be able to see him for a year and a half..mabye more
im pretty sure he wont be there for my graduation next year..:(
im really sad...
i cry at night alot when im by myself..its not good

well yesterday was one of the worst school days ever...lets recapp
zero period- i had a tesst, that i failed, cuz i dont understand trig to well, and my teacher came up to me and was like ""jackie is everything okay at home?""
i wsal ike ""yea.."" but thinking ""wtf..."" haha...i dont know...

then in 1st and 2nd i started my period! which totaly sucked, so i went to the bathrom and put toliet papper on,, so it felt like lumps of shit was under me..heh.

so at break before third..which is spanish, i called my mom to pick me up..so i wait for her to pick me up! so she said she would call my dad..cuz my cramps started to get even worse! so then i waited out infront of the gym for my mom or dad for the whole freaken 3rd period! no one came. so i figured she didnt get a hold of dad..! so i went to 4th..stupid me..cuz we had another quiz! which i prolly failed..then my cramps got really bad, i starrted to sweat...i felt like i was ganna barf, my eyes got watery..so i used my good friends rachel cell phone and went to call my mom..apparently..she was there a half  hour into 4th! meaning i hsould have waited outside!!!! gah! so i come back to class and it gets worse..the cramps..the pain..everything!! so then at lunch i dont talk to anyone i put my head down, pretty much crying cuz it hurts soooo bad...then one of my friends gives me midol..but it dodesnt help ..but then i get to 5th i wait outside my dad comes at 1..and im pretty much home free right? wrong! it gets even worse...so i get home ...i eat somthing..i put in a tampon. but the pjs on..and it starts to get a lil better...

later that day. i played bball at the school, cuz the midol starts to kick in...

and yea....thats about it...

so i will talk to u laterrrrrr

ps. my friend sara got back from paris..and she brought me bak a rock!! :)!! I LOVE IT!!

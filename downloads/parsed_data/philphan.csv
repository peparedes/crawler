Not to be a spoilsport or anything, but if you remove the Brewers from the results, the Phils are 6-14 for August, and have lost 10 straight to teams not from Milwaukee. Talk to me after the Labor Day weekend before we decide whether the Phillies are indeed heating up."

<BLOCKQUOTE>
After the Phils swept the Milwaukee Brewers over the weekend, they thought they might build on that momentum in Houston and return home on a hot streak.

Didn't happen.

Cory Lidle allowed five runs in six innings in an 8-4 loss Monday.

Todd Jones allowed two runs in the eighth inning in a 4-2 loss Tuesday.

Felix Rodriguez's two walks in the eighth inning led to four runs yesterday.

Lidle, Jones and Rodriguez joined the team just before or just after the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline.

They are a combined 2-7 with a 6.62 earned run average since joining the Phillies.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Then there are the other mid-season pitching acquisitions: Paul Abbott and Brian Powell: 12 GS (& 14 relief appearances,) combined 2-8, with a 5.73 ERA. Let's not forget either the waste of space Roberto Hernandez has been out of the pen: 2-4, 3 blown saves, 5.14 ERA.

As a group, these Ed Wade acquisitions for the 2004 season have gone a combined 6-19, 4 blown saves, 170 2/3 IP, 5.75 ERA. This group is the reason the Phillies are now dead in the water. Thrown in Tim Worell for good measure, and suddenly you're looking at 9-24, 11 blown saves, 16 saves, 234 1/3 IP, 5.30 ERA

To be fair, Worrell wasn't hired to be the closer and of all the acquisitions, he was the only one with a recent track record that suggested he should have a decent season; blown saves aside, he has been a perfectly serviceable Major League-average reliever. Nonetheless, Ed Wade should be fired for this gross incompetence."

Initially, the ghost of 1964 rears its ugly head in the second inning, but they show amazing resilience by taking a 7-2 lead in the bottom of the 5th. Not content with the reputation it already has as ""destroyer of all Phillies leads"" the bullpen made sure the lead didn't stick and now the Astros lead 10-7 in the 7th.

The ghost of 1964, once tracked down by a local reporter, was quoted as saying, ""It wasn't enough to let the Astros score a run by stealing home. I had to make sure the Phillies blew a 5-run lead and give up an extra 3 runs as well. Excuse me while I go get a cheesesteak!""

I would, however, like to thank the Phillies for dashing all my postseason hopes in such a brutal and efficient fashion this month. It's making it a lot easier (and less painful) to transition to the football season. E-A-G-L-E-S Go Eagles!

<B>Edit to Add:</B> I was just reading the in-game box score, and apparently Todd Pratt, the only MLBer on Earth slower than Mike Lieberthal, hit into a triple play in the bottom of the 5th, when the Phillies had already scored 3 runs. Man, the Ghost of 1964 has been busy!"

Attention BoSox fans, I know you all love the fact you have Schilling now, and I understand how you feel. I wish the Phillies had traded some of their ""untouchable"" prospects this past off-season to get him back. However, there's already trouble brewing. While Schilling is happy to be pitching for Terry Francona again, the fact is that a Francona-Schilling combo is the worst thing that can happen to him.

<a href=""http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/Kschic0020121999.htm"">Back in 1999</a> Schilling was shelved for a chunk of the season thanks to arm troubles caused by Francona's inability to properly monitor his workload. Those arm troubles required surgery in the 1999-2000 offseason, and as a result he missed <a href=""http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/Ischic0020132000.htm"">the beginning of the 2000 season</a> while he recovered from surgery. Apparently, Francona has learned nothing about pitch counts in the ensuing period as he has already left Schilling <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=240417102"">in a game for over 120 pitches</a> -- something no starter should ever do this early in the season and which Schilling didn't do until <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/mlbhist/players/gamelog?statsId=4267&year=2003"">the middle of May last year</a>.

Look, I still love Schill and I'm hoping over the next few years he can put together the numbers necessary to make him a borderline HOF candidate. However, Francona looks dead set on finishing the job he started on Schilling back in Philly: turning that powerful right arm of his into slag.

Mark my word, if Francona continues to leave Schilling in for too long on a consistent basis, either his September numbers will show a significant decline or he will miss a few important starts due to ""soreness."""

"event","It's supposed to be the season the Phillies finally breakout, with the added bonus of doing so in a new park. It's still early -- we're only seven games into the season -- but saying that the season has gotten off to a lousy start is a tremendous understatement.

In fitting fashion given the team's inglorious history, the Phillies finished a cold, dreary and wet Grand Opening at Citizen's Bank Park with a 1-6 record, the worst record in baseball. They have scored only 16 runs in those seven games -- only Montreal with its 10 runs and two wins has scored fewer. To add insult to injury -- ironically, one of the few things this team is historically good at -- that 1-6 mark has come against the same teams who last September pummeled the Phillies out of wild card contention.

Yesterday was only the third time in 15 seasons I missed the Phillies home opener, and boy am I glad I missed it.

It's far too soon to run for the panic room and start watching the 1980 and 1993 highlight DVDs, but this pratfall out of the gate is disconcerting only if you have a penchant for sugar-coating bad news. For the second year in a row, I allowed myself real optimism for the Phillies chances this year, and it feels like the Phillies are well on their way to breaking my heart again.

While I don't think Bowa is really to blame for this fiasco, I'm hoping the owners are using this stumble as an excuse for giving him the axe. Going back to the end of last season, the Phillies have won only two of their last 15. While the manager can't physically make the players perform under pressure, it is his job to keep the pressure off of them as much as possible, and Bowa is obviously doing a miserable job of it. 

The sooner that albatross is lifted from the necks of the players, the quicker they can get comfortable playing on the field again."

"event","I didn't really do a preseason expectation post about the Phils because this season has an expectation I haven't harbored about the Phillies since I was a kid: on paper, the Phillies are the team to beat in their division. I didn't think that in 1993 -- hell, no one thought that in 1993 -- but I have proof via the Rutgers-Camden student newspaper that I thought that the Phillies that year could exceed everyone's expectations, including my own. I didn't think it last year after the Millwood, Thome and Bell pickups because I wasn't convinced the Braves were down and out just yet.

The only time I really got my hopes up since the 1993 season was at the end of <a href=""http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/05312001.htm"">May, 2001, when they 34-18 and 8 games above the Braves in the standings</a>. (Although, I think I hid my enthusiasm rather well in a comment I made on Baseball Primer on <a href=""http://www.baseballprimer.com/tidbits/archives/archive-05132001-05192001.shtml"">May 21</a> of that year.) Of course, I was given a rude reminder about what happens when you start expecting a lot from this team.

But this year has to be the year.

The Braves continued to hemorrhage talent and the Marlins, who only made the playoffs last year thanks to the fact that <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/philphan/2833.html"">the Phils bullpen lost 14 games where they were tied or leading going into the ninth</a>, experienced a downgrade as well. In contrast, the Phillies shored up their bullpen and improved their rotation by subtracting Duckworth and adding Milton.

There's no doubt the Phillies by all rights should win the division this year. Easily. I didn't really need additional proof, but the projection systems used by <a href=""http://premium.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=2735"">Baseball Prospectus</a> and <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/spring2004/news/story?id=1774245"">Diamond Mind</a> show that the Phillies are the team to beat in the National League. <I>The whole National League</i>, not just the East.

I don't know if I can handle these expectations. I've never had them before.

We'll see what happens. Deep down, I still have this nagging feeling that Mt. Bowa will eventually be the ruin of this team. Hopefully, either he will remain at a low simmer or the Phillies have enough talent to overcome the damage he will inevitably do to this team."

Still, seeing Jose Mesa of all people come in and save the season opener for the Pirates was a little disheartening. It was only the first game of the season, so there's no reason whatsoever for hitting the panic button just yet.  The flip side of that coin was seeing Mike Lieberthal lay down a perfect surprise sacrifice bunt, even if it wasn't what Vuke <a href=""http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/sports/baseball/8364860.htm"">gave him the sign for</a>.

<LI><a href=""http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B05090PHI1993.htm"">May 9, 1993</a>: Mariano Duncan hits an improbable grand slam off of Lee Smith in the bottom of the eighth to give the Phillies a come-from-behind 6-5 win. The on-field heroics help me forget the lobster-esque sunburn I get from sitting in the late May sun for 4 hours without sunscreen.
<LI><a href=""http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B04110PHI1994.htm"">April 11, 1994</a>: First Phillies home game after the improbable 1993 season, and John Kruk's first game back after treatment for testicular cancer. In the pre-game ceremonies in which the players got their 1993 NL Championship rings, the standing ovation for Kruk is so loud that I literally cannot hear my friend Andrew as he is trying to scream something into my ear. Kruk goes 3-5 with a 2B, 2 runs and an RBI, but the Phillies lose.
<LI><a href=""http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B08250PHI1995.htm"">August 25, 1995</a>: Gregg Jefferies hits for the cycle, Jeff Juden tosses a complete game and hits a grand slam and ROY Hideo Nomo is chased from the game after giving up 7 runs in 3 innings.

<LI><a href=""http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B07030PHI1999.htm"">July 3, 1999</a>: The Phillies manhandle the Cubs 21-8. What I remember most though is the Cubs throwing in the towel in the bottom of the 8th and sending Gary Gaetti out to the mound.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
...right-hander Robert Person was released from his minor league contract on Friday... 

Person, 34, underwent surgery to repair a torn Achilles tendon on Feb. 27 in a procedure performed by Dr. Coco Eaton, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays team physician. Person was signed by the White Sox as a free agent on Jan. 21, 2004, and the team had high hopes for the power pitcher to grab the fifth spot in the starting rotation. But Person tore his Achilles during a routine offseason workout in Phoenix, ending his season before it began. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
He was briefly the staff ace after Schilling was traded a few years ago (which ought to tell you something about the state of the pitching staff at the time), but otherwise didn't make much of an impact for the club. However, what I'll always remember about him is <a href=""http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B06020PHI2002.htm"">June 2, 2002</a>.

That day my wife and I were returning from a weekend trip up to Philly to visit friends and family. We were making an early start back; early enough to contemplate an unplanned stop by the Vet to catch the Phils. We decided against it and just listened to the game on the radio as far down I-95 as the signal would go. 

We were only able to hear the first five full innings, which was  enough to see Person put on the offensively display of his life. His linescore: 3 3 2 7 (with one walk). That's right 7 RBIs: A grand slam in the first inning and a 3-run homer in the second. He was on a tight pitch count that day, and since the Phillies had a 14-1 lead going into the bottom of the 5th, you knew his day was done when the Phillies came to bat. Yet, rather than pitch-hit for him when his spot came up with two on and one out, Bowa let him hit anyway -- which paid obvious dividends.

On one hand, I'm still disappointed I only heard the performance on the radio. However, I can't recall having a better time driving home down I-95."

"event","Baseball Prospectus published <a href=""http://premium.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=2561"">an analysis of catcher's arms</a> last week, and looking at it you'd think that Mike Lieberthal had the worst arm of any catcher in Major League Baseball.

Don't believe the hype.

His lousy rating is easily explained by the fact that pitching coach Joe Kerrigan told the Phillies pitching staff to virtually ignore holding runners on first. The catching woes this questionable coaching practice inflicted were only worsened by the fact that Kevin Millwood has one of the slowest deliveries to home in all of baseball.

I know there's really no other way than stolen base percentage to rate a catcher's arm, but clearly Lieberthal's numbers for the 2001 & 2002 seasons suggest that his 2003 numbers were a fluke."

I don't what to think of this, but if the Phillies say they have no concerns then there really isn't much I can say other than the Nicaraguan newspaper which ran the initial story may be going for sensational. However, I don't have any basis for that speculation.

Anyway, fair or not, it's something to file away for future reference. If Padilla's performance suffers this year, we may know why. On the other hand, Grover Cleveland Alexander was one of the biggest alcoholics in baseball history, and it didn't seem to hurt <a href=""http://www.baseball-reference.com/a/alexape01.shtml"">his career</a> too much."

"event","Not actually Phillies-oriented, but it does tangentially relate to them. From <a href=""http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/sports/7860711.htm"">today's <I>Miami Herald</i></a>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You'll find greed and gluttony in these pages about as often as boxscores. Fans not angered or repulsed by the scent of it are merely numb by now, lobotomized, the dollars not registering in any real-world context. But salary is how athletes keep score between games, so it takes Pudge but a few months to go from lovable face of an underdog team to yet another rented mercenary blowing through South Florida on his way to the next bank.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

You know what... stop bitching when a star athlete on your favorite team signs to play for a different team when they throw greater amounts of money at him. We all decide at some point in our lives to move to another company doing exactly the same work because they will pay us more for it. Athletes have the same right and should not be berated for it. Yet, millions of people in this country (myself included) wrap part of their self-identity around an organization that is a business first and entertainment second, and the the majority of these people feel as though that gives them the right to complain when athletes exercise the right we all have.

It's time to stop pontificating about ""the love of the game,"" ""doing it for the fans,"" and ""how much money is too much?"" Despite what some obviously want to believe (check out the HBO series <I>When it Was Still a Game</I> to see what I'm referring to), baseball -- and all professional sports for that matter -- has always been a business. It just so happens that for the majority of the 20th century the owners had a vice-like grip on the movement of players and the salaries they received. To idealize that era of sports as somehow more pure is just self-delusional crap. The business world is a cut-throat, merciless arena and the sports world is no different.

In light of what I said, this is the reason why I don't begrudge Curt Schilling one iota for insisting the Phillies trade him back in the summer of 2000. It didn't hurt that he said the right things when leaving town, i.e., the fans weren't the problem, it was management. This is unlike Scott Rolen who couldn't wait to bad-mouth the Philly fans on his way out the door. If he had just taken the same approach as Schilling when demanding his trade, I guarantee you he wouldn't hear the boos that now great him in Philly."

"event","It wasn't Earth-shattering news, but on Friday Vicente Padilla and the Phillies <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1723054"">agreed on a $2.6 million contract for 2004</a>. Compared on what the Phillies are paying other members of the starting rotation, this is an absolute steal.

Depending on how the arbitration process works out, Millwood will make between $10 million and $12.5 million this year. Eric Milton is set for $9 million and Randy Wolf is set for $4.25 million. Based on the salaries alone, Padilla is by far the best bargin, but when you consider the stats for the pitchers over the past few seasons, you can argue that Padilla is actually the ace of the staff, which makes his salary that much more of a bargain. Consider the following: 

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TH COLSPAN=5>2001-2003 Stats</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TH>Player</TH><TH>Wins</TH><TH>Losses</TH><TH>Win %</TH><TH>ERA</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Padilla</TD><TD>31</TD><TD>24</TD><TD>.564</TD><TD>3.51</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Wolf</TD><TD>37</TD><TD>30</TD><TD>.552</TD><TD>3.70</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Millwood</TD><TD>39</TD><TD>27</TD><TD>.591</TD><TD>3.78</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Milton</TD><TD>29</TD><TD>16</TD><TD>.644</TD><TD>4.47</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
Before going any further, it should be noted that Padilla only saw sporadic work as a reliever in 2001 and that Milton only started three games last year.

Based solely on winning percentage, Padilla certainly doesn't look like the staff ace. However, I don't subscribe to the Joe Morgan <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=morgan_joe&id=1604152"">school of thinking</a>, i.e., the only stat that matters is wins. If that was the case, Eric Milton would be the projected ace of the staff, and I don't think anyone is arguing that. No, wins are subject to the whims of the team's offense. Take Nolan Ryan's 1987 season where he went 8-16 despite leading the league in ERA and strikeouts. He also finished 5th in Cy Young voting that year. I guess the voters certainly didn't think that his win total mattered.

Still, ERA alone doesn't tell the whole story. The peripheral numbers:

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TH>Player</TH><TH>ERA</TH><TH>K/BB</TH><TH>WHIP</TH><TH>HR/9IP</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Padilla</TD><TD>3.51</TD><TD>2.28</TD><TD>1.24</TD><TD>0.78</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Wolf</TD><TD>3.70</TD><TD>2.61</TD><TD>1.20</TD><TD>1.10</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Millwood</TD><TD>3.78</TD><TD>2.61</TD><TD>1.21</TD><TD>0.72</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Milton</TD><TD>4.47</TD><TD>3.05</TD><TD>1.24</TD><TD>1.36</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
Note: WHIP = (Walks + Hits)/Innings Pitched

Suddenly, the reason why Padilla's ERA is lower becomes much clearer. Although the Padilla's W/BB ratio is lower than the other four's and the WHIPs for the four are nearly identical, he's far stingier than Wolf or Milton in giving up the long ball. However, is should be noted that all of Millwood's peripheral numbers are slightly better than Padilla's, which suggests that he might have had a little more bad luck than Padilla (i.e., Millwood's relievers allowed a higher percentage of inherited runners to score than Padilla's relievers) or he doesn't pitch as well when runners are on base.

Either way, Padilla is on par with Millwood in terms of talent. With all factors being virtually equal, you can make the argument (albeit not conclusively) that Padilla is the staff ace. In fact, based soley on the peripheral numbers, you can just as easily make an argument for Wolf as ace. Regardless, it's certainly clear that Padilla's a far greater bargain for the Phillies than Millwood, or any of the other former Phillies All Stars for that matter."

"event","I certainly hope that Jimmy Rollins has <a href=""http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/sports/baseball/7811867.htm"">come to see the light</a> in regards to his plate discipline:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For several years, people inside and outside the Phillies organization have tried to convince Rollins that he should hit the ball on the ground and use his speed. Rollins has chosen instead to turn on fastballs and swing for the fences. That approach works for the 6-foot-4, 245-pound Thome, but not for the 5-8, 167-pound Rollins.

""Things are making sense to me now,"" Rollins said. ""I feel like I can finally make those adjustments. I've seen the light.""

Rollins decided he needed to change his offensive approach late last season when the Phillies were playing the Florida Marlins. Rollins sensed that Florida catcher Pudge Rodriguez was trying exploit his lack of plate discipline by calling change-ups and curveballs in counts when Rollins ordinarily saw fastballs.

""Everything made sense when I realized what he was trying to do to me,"" Rollins said.

During spring training, Rollins will continue to work on putting the ball in play with manager Larry Bowa.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Right now, it's easy to get excited about the notion that he's taking the advice to heart. However, we'll see how much this worked come mid-June."

"event","Welcome to the beginning of <I>Red, White & Blue</i>, a blog dedicated to the Philadelphia Phillies. Having made an appropriate introduction, we'll start with a story that ESPN.com posted yesterday.

Apparently, the Yankees are <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=klapisch_bob&id=1720059"">now in need of a third baseman</a>. Aaron Boone is out for the year after blowing out his ACL in a contract-forbidden activity. Although I doubt the Phillies would consider it, they would be a perfect fit for the Yankkes; David Bell is incredibly expendable.

Think about it, the Yankees have a predilection for aging veterans with a reputation better than their on-field record warrants, and the Phillies have a logjam of infielders and need to open up space for Chase Utley. In fact, at the end of last season they proved moving Placido Polanco to third and allowing Utley to play second was eminently feasible. Furthermore, the Yankees have the means to take Bell's onerous contract off of the Phillies hands.

It doesn't even matter what the Phillies get in return."

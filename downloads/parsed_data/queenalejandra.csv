Wow... I haven't updated in awhile. =O I guess I'd better.  Some stuff has happened, anyway.

First and foremost, I probably won't be using my AIM username ""kougouseiplum"" as much anymore.  I'll most likely use ""Neglected Waffle"".  So... update your buddy lists, everyone. -_- Also, I have no idea what's up with my layout... if the slices are going all weird on ya, you'll just have to deal with it until it fixes itself. XP ... you know, I used to design layouts mostly to make an impression on people, since that was really my only medium, but now I've decided to start doing layouts on things that *I* like, and changing them whenever *I* want.  I have an idea for a new layout, but I don't want to have to worry about that right now.  Or worry about fixing the current one.  So it stays up, broken as it is.  

I don't know if I've said anything about this on here, but I was asked to go to a gaming party at Ray's today about a week ago (confusing much?).  I wasn't planning on going, since I was feeling pretty sick last night, but Holly and Tom showed up at my house this morning so I decided to go. ^_^() Tucker wanted me to pretty badly too, so I went for him somewhat. XP Not completely for him, because he told me that there was a chance that he wouldn't get to go, but I would have felt bad if I wouldn't have gone since he wanted me to.  Yeah.  So anyway, I got there and played SSB Melee and DOA... 2? for a few hours (I did well at SSBM, but sucked hardcore at DOA XD).  Then <a href=""http://www.layer-infinity.net/flex"" target=""_blank"">Flex</a> and <a href=""http://www.layer-infinity.net/barcode"" target=""_blank"">Tucker</a> (I don't know why I'm calling Fletcher by that nickname... I guess because of his blog URL... ? XD) showed up, yey.  So I kept playing DOA and he played a bit of SSB Melee, and then I went over and unlocked Falco for them, ohoho, and then everyone ran away from SSBM, probably because we'd been playing it all morning. XD So me and Tucker sat in front of the Gom Kyuube in the two comfy chairs (reference! XP) and watched about three hours of four level nine CPUs fighting each other. ^_^() ""It's weird over in this corner... everytime I come over, those two either look stoned or one is on the floor"" - Ray. XD He also said we were pathetic and depressing =D() After all of that, Tuck and Ray went into another room and started listening to Python sketches on CD, so I followed Tuck in there. ^_^ He ate Pixi Stix and danced around, and I drank his three cans of soda. ^_^() Then Flex came in the room and we sat around, listened to Celtic music, and talked (well they talked, I listened, and I was dubbed Silent Girl at the end of the night XP) until 10:30, when we all started to go home.  It was cool... I got to hear a bit more about <a href=""http://kiefl_bryer.tripod.com/trousers"" target=""_blank"">Trousers</a> and some other stuff I never really understood.  Talked about Monty Python, annoying (as an adjective, here) people, other random stuff... whee.  It was way better than sitting home all day. XD

What else... oh yeah, I'll probably end up buying Morrowind wif my money.  If I don't, I have a feeling someone's going to poison my food or something. -_-() It's not like I don't <i>want</i> Morrowind, it's just that everyone's forcing it on me. XD Oh well.

I still have to BUY t-shirts, too. =\

I.  Am.  Switching to trombone.  I <i>really</i> don't want to play clarinet.  I'm going to sort things out tomorrow.  I can't stand those idiots... ergh.

Also... a few minutes ago... I... finished watching Father Ted. =D =D =D Eeeee, it was waaaaaay better than I thought it would be. XDDDD It's fucking hilarious. XP That show is so random... and planned... and ""coincidential""... it's just so damn awesome!  I wish we still had BBC America, I would do anything to be able to see that show on the television. *_* Augh, I loved it!!!  Lookit that!  I used multiple exclamation points!  That is how much I LOVE it!  And now let me indulge in a lol!  *LOL* Ahhhhh, it's one of the best shows I've ever seen.  I think I like it a bit too much. XD Ergh, the joy is seeping into my veins and poisoning me!  It's like when you drink too much water!  Squee! XD I still have to watch Tucker's Python tapes, so that'll probably happen tomorrow.  I'll stay up really late for one last night, then I'm going to start going to bed at a more responsible time.  Otherwise school will be death for me.  Yeah, it will be anyway.  I dun wanna go to schooooool.  Except for band, now that I won't be playing clarinet anymore... hopefullyhopefullyHOPEFULLY, and probably.

Also also, I must play Earthbound. o_o I haven't played it a really long time, and that's bad of me. *sweatdrop* I want to play it partially because it's rocks hardcore as far as I've seen RPGs rock, and I want to play FFIV and Chrono Trigger since I went and bought them and everything. ^_^() I'll probably play Chrono Trigger first, since FFVIII has scared me away from Final Fantasy games for awhile.  Heh heh.  I didn't think it was <i>that</i> bad, but I made so many mistakes and sucked so bad that it was just... ick.  I don't want to do that again.  So I'm going to practice the level-busting techniques that I gained from playing PokeRed. _-_() That's like, the only RPG I ever finished quickly and efficiently.  With all the others, I've left big spaces in between playtime and done stupid things like dropping behind everything by a zillion levels.  So I promise myself I won't do stupid stuff when playing Earthbound and Chrono Trigger.  Promise. -_-()

I'm finished with my sickness, as well. ^_^ Things are just goin' my way.  I'm getting invited to Filia's AIM chats, too... how special do I feel. XP"

XD

You know, me and Tucker have only seen each other once since we've been together.  PATHETIC.  It's nearing a month... actually, no, it's been about twenty days.  But still.  We have to wait until school starts to actually see each other.  Sucks.

Kiryuu is acting weird... I think it's because I'm downloading to much in WinMX.  I have a bunch of Python sketches and a few Newsboys songs going.  Heh heh.  I am a download whore.  And a layout whore.  Especially a layout whore.  I <i>just</i> put up a layout, and I already want to make another.  The only thing that's stopping me is that people seem to really like the current one ^_^() So I guess I'll stick with it for a while.  I had my first ever layout up for a loooooong time.  I finally forced myself to make one, and then when I got it up I was so proud of it that I didn't want to touch it.  Plus I thought if I started a new one I'd get to lazy and quit it in the middle.  So one day I started making the layout for the late FFRPG, and I was like... ""ROCK!"" so I used it for my own blog :D It was my dear Black Mage, I believe.  Then came my Eric layout, then my Glamour layout, then a really strange dark purple one with lots of freaky black and white lines all over... then the current one.  The only thing with the current one is that because of the image editing and filters I applied, Anthy looks like she's not wearing a shirt (not that that would be strange as far as Utena art goes).  At least Fletcher likes it XD

I really want a goldfish.  Like, a lot. o_o I want to name it Zelgadis :D That would r0x0r hardcore.  Too bad that my parents don't trust me with fish anymore. <_< I've killed every fish I've had within a week.  But that's because of the retarded fishbowl we have.  It is! XP

Nothin' more to say.  I'll go fill out post options now~ =D I love Livejournal."

"event","I have a Livejournal.  Bwahaha.  All because I joined LJ before the code system came into play.  I'm messing around with the template style-things, trying to get mine to look like <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/lovelyduckling"" target=""_blank"">Betsy</a>'s or <a href=""http://www.deadjournal.com/users/drifterrogue"" target=""_blank"">Eevee</a>'s.  I swear I have tried every possible combination and still, nothing has worked. -_- Well, in any case I'm glad that I have a more private place to say things.  Most of my posts will be friends only, and my friends will be limited XD"

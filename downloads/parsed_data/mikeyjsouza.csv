"event","so the road trip part of my traveling is basically done. tomorrow i will be in melbourne, my final destination for my car until April. so after 2 months and 9000 miles the road trip has come to and end. it was a blast. could not have wanted anything better. i met awesome people, road and hiked at some of the coolest places in the US, and was able to see so much. i also learned a lot more about bicycles and repairing them, something i am obviously into.  AND i was offered a potential service manager position in Southern California, which would be a damn fun thing to do for a few years. possibly stressful since it would be for a brand new shop, but it could be fun. i am keeping my thoughts on that option for the coming year. i could live there for a bit :-). for now just chilling in FL, building bikes, and waiting til TAHOE!!! :-)"

"event","so my road trip is almost done. i should be in FL again soon and start work almost right when i return. though soon after that i will hopefully be flying back to NH to get my stuff together for skiing in Tahoe. then back to NH for Christmas, followed by another winter working in FL (no school this time!!!). i am looking forward to it. will be so different w/o school and i cannot imagine it being a bad time. 

about this trip: i highly recommend a similar adventure to anyone who can make it happen. save the money and plan it out. i did it around UBI and biking/hiking everywhere i could. if you are into something else, do that. but traveling is such an amazing way to see and experience things you do not connect with at home, no matter where you live. i also chose the U.S. because i wanted to see this country before i explored another, but go wherever. just travel someplace. being comfi at home is awesome and all, but i know i have learned a lot on this trip and met many great people. and i have seen things and ridden and hiked at places most people will never see. it has been a blast and i am so thankful for the chance to take this trip. hopefully i will take another one someday, maybe with company instead of solo. shall see how it goes.  

still having a blast :-D. hopefully i will soon be seeing people back in NH. take it easy"

i still miss her. it is such a strange thing after all this year threw at me; after so much i still know i want to be with her (at least when she is not putting up a wall, or hiding from me). who knows if we will be in the same place again and both want an exclusive relationship, but right now that still feels like it would be perfect...i dunno. seems so simple, but after this year i have trouble believing it could even be possible (the things said last night sound great to say the least, but it's hard)..."

got back, unpacked, organized things, went shopping for clothes and other stuff. was able to hang out with Timmy a few times (we went biking twice and skating twice), I saw Caitlin twice (and her family once which was cool), went to see ""Over the Hedge"" with Beth, hung out/got lunch with Melanie, and hung out with Alex. was nice to see everyone that was in town. wish a couple other people could have been around as well, but i am sure we'll be in touch

"event","what a great week. there are few things that could have gone any better, and none i am unhappy with about this break. started by assembling my new mtn bike (which rocks!), then working friday night/saturday. rode on sunday and monday as i said in my last entry (awesome! - i am so happy to be on a bike again). also saw family and James/his parents which was really nice. rode again on tuesday morning/early afternoon. then saw Curious George with Audrey that evening and had some dinner/wine and hung out for a couple hours. worked wed til 5 (and sold TONS of stuff), then got home and forgot about a concert! (don't ask how - i don't know really - been spacing out in terms of dates lately) so instead of the concert, Elisa and i went to get sushi and then went down to the beach. hung out by the water for a while and talked, then over to the park and hung out on the swingsets for a while longer - awesome night :-).  1st of a few late nights (late for me anyway, haha). thursday i rode again (this time at Turkey Creek - bashed my head good too - helmets are wonderful). stopped by the shop, bank, and grocery store. hung around doing lots of nothing/trying to sleep for a few hours, then went out to Chaz's and drank too much too quickly :-P. drinking games...ohy. but it was a good time; i had fun. once i was able to drive i got home, then up another hour til about 4 talking on AIM (been doing that a lot lately - good conversations :-) ). friday i was not getting up early to ride so stayed in bed til 9 or 10. then food and off to work at about 12:30 til 7. then went to see UltraViolet with Zack, Julie, and some other person i don't know. then home and AIM yet again, haha. saturday i rode in the morning/early afternoon, then watched some mtn biking on TV, then down to the pool with a book. watched Empire Records with Elisa that night, and hung out listening to the cds she brought me :-D til about 2:30. sleep an hour later. today, work from about 11:45-4; got the new headset installed on my bike and hung out with KC talking about biking and wine. tonight not much - new Family Guy and finished reading My Uncle Oswald

overall, i had a damn good break; quite relaxing. with the obvious exception being school, things are kicking ass right now :-)"

"event","lately this is how i go about my days (basically since returning from winter break and returning from Tahoe):

while i am awake my thoughts are constantly reminded of what has changed. i no longer get to hang out with the person i have the most fun with; the person whose company i enjoy more than any other's. now she is with some other guy, in his arms; he gets to hang out and enjoy her company. its quite hard to focus on classes, etc when this is going through your head. no longer can i share the best parts of my day with her; can't call when something crazy, awesome, weird happens just to talk about it; can't call just to say a quick hello and ""i love you"" - hell, i can't even say that anymore, though i still feel that way. i miss her more than i can say; i miss the smiles, the laughs, the giggles, the tapping of the nose when making a decision, the crunched up nose face when i am sarcastic or being a smart ass, the hugs, everything...i miss hanging out with one of my best friends. throughout the day i think of these things, as well as others. sometimes specific thoughts, sometimes more general. i run the range from being in a sad/depressed mood to being angry and frustrated to feeling more hurt than i ever have been before. it's a tough battle, trying to destroy any hope that remains in my mind of ""us"" (i am still baffled - so many amazing memories, such strong emotions...i am still so in love) and trying to move myself past this slowly without becoming bitter and without killing an amazing friendship (yeah, i realize it's probably not my responsibility to keep that going right now, but i want it to stay). i know there are worse things in life, but at the moment this whole process hurts so much. tough when someone you are so close to begins to be around less and less, to gradually put distance between you; when you can't call or say hello any time you want anymore. it's tough to go through every day with this stuff ever-present in my thoughts...that's enough for now

wish i felt we could always hang out and be ourselves around each other still. sometimes it feels like we do for the most part; like the other night when we went out for sushi and came back here to watch some tv and hang out. but other times it is as if there is an invisible wall separating us, keeping things from being said or keeping us from goofing around. i hate that so much. esp since the last time we truly were ourselves around each other was in Tahoe, which was unbelievable. now i feel like you purposely put up a wall, not allowing certain things...maybe i'm wrong, but sometimes i almost certain i am not. and i hate having to hold back what i am thinking or how i feel; it sucks

still wonder, how do you feel? it was only a few weeks ago that the word love was used. still passes through my mind: do you still feel that? do you miss ""us""? do you miss me? does me no good to think about it, but not like i can magically stop it. i guess even if you do it does not matter right now. and if you do not well, then i guess all this is for the best anyway...this entry may continue to get longer over the next day or so

knowing the one you love is happily with another...i can't even describe it...so hard

wish there was something i could do; i would do it in an instant, without a 2nd thought...

this is so difficult - i am still in love with Audrey"

honestly, there is only 1 thing i am certain of at this point in my life with regards to what i want and i hope it works out. by far the 1 thing i most want to remain after graduation - shall see i  guess. (i am not including things i want that i think are a given)

DAY 1: drive from Melbourne to James' place in Orlando. then to airport (with little time to spare!) and give James my car for a few days. get to security and there is a HUGE line and the lady working there tells us we have plenty of time (30 minutes! i think not!). so after getting to the back of the line i went back and talked to the lady again, telling her we did not have time and would miss our flight. run back to get Audrey and skip the line, get through security and get to our gate as our seats are boarding. being on the plane is always a good feeling (Audrey and I have issues with traveling it seems - always just in time). oh, almost forgot - quote of the trip: ""sex on the couch"" - nice work Audrey - said that one quite loudly while boarding the plane - so damn funny! - don't ask. flight to Pheonix was fun (tho loooong); played cranium trivia and watched some of the in-flight movie (something about race horses with kurt russell and some girl...i dunno). got to Pheonix and our flight was overbooked so we did not have a seat! hmmm...decided to take our $300 flight voucher and fly out the next morning (would still have time to ski and it would mean not having to take a shuttle from Reno to Tahoe which was great!). so Audrey's sister and brother-in-law picked us up at the airport (only place she has family out West) and we stayed with them the night. that was fun. they are so great; i had a really good time hanging out with them for the few hours we did. crashing there also helped us adjust to the time a little easier.

Day 2: left for Reno on an 8:10 flight and arrived about 2 hrs later around 9 (time change in there). was awesome to see the change in elevation as we flew. from desert and flat to high, snow-covered mountains. arrived at the airport (where there are slot machines everywhere!!! this seems to be a BIG theme in Nevada - craziness). Greg and Lori picked us up and we began the drive to Reno. stopped at ""Jack in the Box"" to get some tacos and a breakfast borrito (so good! :-P) and then back on the road. was a beautiful drive up the mountains and then along the lake. went to the cabin first to get the skis i was using (i didnt have to rent!!! :-D. Greg's old skis fit my boots so i was in luck.) then to the ski shop to get Audrey's rentals and get ""my"" skis set at the right tension, etc. back to the cabin to change and then to the room Audrey and I were staying in (at the Marriot in Heavenly Village, on Heavenly mountain - holy shit were we spoiled all weekend!). we could walk from our room to the lockers downstairs, get our skis and get to the gondola in 5-10 minutes; how insane is that? then skied at half day at Heavenly - AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL day. nice and sunny and warm and great snow. i loved the skis and just jumped into it, going as fast as i could right away - it was a blast. oh how i love skiing. and seeing Lake Tahoe from the mountain; wow, amazing views. one done skiing we went back to our room and got ready for dinner at the Lakeside Inn. Greg and Lori came to pick us up and we went out, got dinner and sort of gave in to a little gambling (i gave Greg a dollar so he would not spend 20 and we ended up winning 25 cents and quitting). was a fun time (sirah with dinner was good too :-P). then back to our room. then i think we went to the store for some food and Mike's hard lime (might have been earlier, i cant remember). Grocery stores in CA have so much damn alcohol. it was in almost every isle - crazy! back to the room, then down to the hot tub (yeah for outside hot tubs and alcohol when its below freezing outside - so nice!). after that i don't remember exactly (no i wasn't drunk). i assume inside, hang out, and sleep by about 10 or so.

Day 3: up early to see about skiing. didn't happen. snow storm. ended up getting over a foot of snow that day and heard people later saying it wasn't so great to ski - no visibility and just windy and miserable. so we chilled in the room most of the day and wandered around the hotel a little. went to the plaza across the street and i found some post cards and t-shirts, and we stopped at star-bucks for some chai and apple cider. were going to go to Greg and Lori's cabin to watch football with them, but the road to the cabin is crazy-steep and 1 car had already gone off the road near them so they did not want to drive to get us, and understandably so. so we went back to the grocery store and found some food for omletes which turned out quite good. had most of a bottle of Rosemount Estates 2001 show reserve Shiraz (really good) while watch a ""Mighty Ducks"" movie, then to the hot tub with some more Mike's. after we got out there it started snowing again and we stayed long enough to be caught in what was basically a white out. being in a hot tub while there is a snow storm going around you is awesome! then, back to the room, hang out, a little more wine, and crash for the night.

Day 4: up early to get food and dressed for skiing at Squaw Valley. shuttle picked us up, and after an almost 3 hour drive (should have only been 90 minutes to 2 hours, but crazy traffic) we finally got there over an hour after the mtn opened. so it took a few runs before either of us was in a good mood again - its annoying to sit in a bus for that long waiting in slow-moving traffic. Squaw is unbelievable! i have never seen or skied anything like it. almost the entire place is bowl skiing. it was the hardest skiing i have ever done and also some of the most fun. there was 2 feet of powder from the day before in some places. so awesome. did one trail that was ""experts only."" DAMN. that was the hardest trail i have ever done. i think it probably took us at least 15 minutes because we were being so cautious. it was a blast though. by the end of the day, between the crazy skiing and a lack of food (skipped lunch and just have clif bars instead since we started late) we were exhausted. back on the shuttle and on our way to the other side of the lake again. got back and showered really quickly. then to the Lakeside Inn again. this time ate by ourselves at the Mexican restaurant downstairs while everyone else gambled a little. great food and it was cheap because they just want people to gamble. had half of it, packed up the rest and got going soon afterward. again, hot tub (both this night - 1 was crazy hot and 1 was a littl cool) and alcohol (triple black this night). then back upstairs and TV for a while. watch part of ""Troy"" which i cannot say was great, but what i saw was alright. i was a bit tipsy at this point (not eating much until dinner, skiing, and alcohol...yeah). then sleep shortly after the movie ended.

Day 5: skied Heavenly all day. it snowed some more and was cloudy and cold for most of the day, but the skiing was good. my legs were dead from the day before at Squaw, but i still had a good time, just did not sky wonderfully. met Greg for lunch and he showed us from trails we had not been able to find - they were awesome. some great pictures from them as well. so we skied a few runs with him, then took a break to warm up in one of the lodges. my favorite run at Heavenly is Galaxy i think. that run is so fast and just nice in about every way. it was also my best run of the day (and the 1st day at Heavenly probably as well). Audrey said ""i'll race you"" and suddenly my legs felt stronger. i bombed down the trail and skied like i was not tired at all - it was awesome. i hauled ass and it felt great. definitely a great run. soon after that it was time to head it. gondola down to the Marriot (oh yeah - i forgot, we stayed here for free!) and then finished packing up and left. went over to Caeser's to get our shuttle tickets, then to ""Bill's"" for a couple drinks and a little food. then said goodbye and thanks, and got on the shuttle. to the airport and on our flight to Las Vegas. had 1 aborted landing coming in to Vegas, then got in. JUST got to our connecting flight (screens already said ""closed""). we literally ran to the gate. got on the plane, tried and maybe succeeded to sleep for a couple hours on the plane. got back to Orlando at 6am, and after picking up my car in long term parking (thanks James) drove back to Melbourne. then i got to do hw instead of sleep and ended up getting through the day on about 2 hours +/- of sleep...

the trip was absolutely amazing. i had such a good time. the skiing was unbelievable, the area was beautiful, and being there with Audrey was perfect. also can't beat a free place to stay and getting a flight voucher. was cool to meet more of Audrey's family as well; they are awesome. so yeah, everything went extremely well. Lake Tahoe kicks ass. if you ever have to chance to go, i stronly urge you to do so, esp if you like skiing. it is such a nice place. 

thanks Audrey. as i said, the trip was so much better because i spent it with you. i know here things are somehow different and what we had in Tahoe, and before, may not be possible for whatever reason; but don't forget: i love you... it was nice to be able to express that this past weekend - that, along with skiing and everything else made for an amazing weekend; one of the best trips i have ever taken - thanks

"event","getting back here today made me realize something: most, almost all, of my best memories from college and florida over the past 2 years have involved Audrey. all of my favorite things to do here involve Audrey. even being in my apartment feels bittersweet in a way because we started hanging out when she was living in this complex, and we became really really close last winter when we were spending a lot of time here (dinner/wine, hw, valentine's...the list can go on for a long time). there is something distinct about this apartment that makes me automatically associate it with her (esp at this time of year). most of the things i love to do here in florida have involved her: dinner/wine nights, cribbage and chess, beach nights, just hanging around, movies, ice cream, dinner out, etc....even school really. i enjoyed going to classes that i shared with her. i enjoyed going to school because i knew between classes i would see her and be able to hang out and talk about whatever, or dream about skiing. i loved that she knew so much biology that was so different from what i know. i loved the passion applied to so many things, many different and many the same as what i apply myself to.

these are still the things i love about Audrey, these and many, many more...

i don't know, maybe some people would say i got too attached. but what is the point of being with someone if you are not attached? can you honestly love someone you are not attached to? hell, i will keep living, but i am hurting right now. i have been hurting for a long time (months now, off and on i guess) because of uncertainty and because i have lost part of the best relationship i have ever had with a person in any way. also is the worst to be hurt by those you are closest to. i gave all of myself, purposely not holding things back that i do from most people; i tried to be all i could for her; i still want to be there and give my best....back to my train of thought; attachment is not the same as dependence, tho similar in many ways which makes it hard to describe i think. but yeah, i was and am attached. i am still completely in love with Audrey and do not want to be with anyone else. honestly, no one i know can consistently affect my mood in a positive way like she can; just being around her calms me and brings about a smile. i am more motivated and often more productive mentally when around her. i am not sure what to do right now. all i can do it go on about my days and let time do its thing i guess...love does not die easily...


i have 1 picture out on my desk. it may be time to put it away, but i do not want to and i probably won't. i have ""mike's rainy day box,"" happy bunny, and jack-jack on my desk as well...i do not want to put these away. they all mean so much...at least to me...fuck....there is also the ""giant"" microbes...so many things that can easily bring such a big smile to my face that right now are difficult to see because i feel like things are falling apart in some ways. 

i truly saw this lasting til the end of the year, maybe further depending on where we lived. hell, i know the 2nd part of that is not the most realistic, but after nantucket i have no place to be. at that point i can go anywhere, and oddly enough would for her i think. but yeah, at least saw it going til may. now i am not sure what we are. obviously friends, but after the talks we have had this break i cannot believe that there is not more to it. but another is in the picture so i am not...i don't know exactly...but we are not together in a relationship anymore and that hurts a lot and will take time to get over (obviously). i will make myself figure it out and work it out, but this is so hard...i don't want to give up, but feel like that might become too much and kill a great friendship...hard to figure out how to be a friend without giving so much of myself that i remain wrecked...

i may add to this part later...
[ADDITION when not so emotional: i guess i wish she still wanted what we had, becuase i deinitely do still want that; whatever it was, i loved it. i need to make some changes and i will make them either way - i am still growing and they will take place, probably sooner than later. but yeah, i really wish she still wanted what we had, still wanted ""us"". but if she doesn't, what can i do???...damn this is...]

going into the shop today was weird. for the 1st time at this shop, i felt like i was nearing the end of being there. obviously in a few months i am, but i actually felt for the 1st time that it is not where i am supposed to be. i think it was more general than that; think i am actually starting to think about life after bike shops and maybe even ski shops...i still do not know what lies after them, and for now still love working on bikes and might try my hand at working on a mtn next winter, but i think i am getting antzy now that school is coming to a close. i think i am actually begining to want something more...not sure what, but something more challenging, something that requires more of me than jobs and school ever have...not sure how to explain this better at the moment"

"event","so, winter break is basically done. back to FL tomorrow. classes start monday. (tho i am going to Lake Tahoe in a week...so winter break gets a small extension once classes start i guess). 

overall, it's been a good break. i got to ski, see my family, see a lot of friends, and have had a relaxing few weeks. probably should not have been so lazy the last few days and seen people again, but it did not happen. we will be home again i am sure. so yeah, this winter break has been nice. hard to believe only 5 months of school left...amazes me that it is already that close...

this break has been different too. things with Audrey are still as uncertain as ever in my mind. i am still completely in love and feel exactly the same about her as i have for a long time now; i am so happy when around her - it's craziness, so awesome. and despite being told similar things, leaving FL on a great note, and talking basically every day this break, things may not be any different the second we return to FL. i wish i did not have to know what i would do if she is still seeing him when we get back, but i may have to figure it out fairly soon...just hard when i think about what i have been told, what i know, and what i have experienced...all i can do is keep going and hope things work out for the best, whether we are together or not

either way, i cannot wait for Tahoe. it will be a great trip and i would not want to spend it with anyone else"

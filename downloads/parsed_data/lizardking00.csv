"event","I haven't wrote because not much is going on.  Partying every day... Thats about it.  Now I have hit my all time low.  I hit rock bottom and bounced.  There is nowhere to go but up...thank God.  God, something I've forgot about for too long.  I still long for a companion.  Valentines day was great this year... had a gorgeous Finnish Date ( she is an exchange student) and then her family wouldnt let her go out.  Fucking great!  I got an MIC on Friday which was fun.  I hate my life.  I hate myself.  Ive said these things before, but they were only hollow words until now.  God has to hate me for forgetting him.  I didnt forget you.. just neglected you.  Im probably going to get drafted, go to war, and die of smallpox or possibly some anthrax.  Wow, look at all I have to look forward to.  Probation, Community service, War, Death.  Only one of those will provide me with peace.  This fatalist attitude is truly depressing, but i know nothing else.  Maybe thats why I havent met any good girls.  Gods pissed and hes about to kill me, thats why he wont let me get attached to anyone or vice versa.  To God:  Let me meet someone who can really love me before my premature death.  Let me know true happiness before you end this misery we call life.  You give us life as a gift, yet it is the source of all pain.  Let me see the happiness that I see everyone around me enjoying.  I see couples, and I die inside.  I have never met a girl who was real.  The only ones I've met want my dick not my words. They might as well be deaf and dumb. That or they decieve and lie and cheat and give pain in place of love.  I'm done with those kinds of people.  I want a real girl.  Someone who can love every single little quirk I have.  Who will love me for who I am not what I could be.  Im done having people trying to mold me into their idea of a perfect man.  LOVE ME FOR WHO AND WHAT I AM OR DO NOT LOVE ME AT ALL.  I've enjoyed pretty faces for long enough.  Now I need a beautiful soul to live behind a pretty face.  But is there such a thing?  It seems to be an oxymoron. Girls with pretty faces are for the most part shallow.  They are ugly.  Their face means nothing to me.  GOD, send me an angel who will bare her soul. Show me the happiness I see all around.  I know only the shadows that plague the light.  Show me love. Real love. No lies, no cheating, no deceptions.  Show me life."

"event","Did you even think about it till it was over?  Thats how it was for me.  Now I cant stop thinking about it.  Im starting to enter that period of depression I face around this time of year.  I didnt even know what depression was before I met her.  Now its an annual devil I must exorcise.  I listen to the same sad songs and sit alone, watching the snow fall.  Its strange, I find some comfort in this... possibly because it is now familiar to me.  I need somthing to break this cycle...  Somthing of the female persuasion.  Happiness will defeat these times. If you happen to see a courier of good times, send him my way.  By the way Felis ano nuevo!"

It shoots through the cold biting air
Until it is a whisper among the gentle hills around
The sun sinks into the jagged peaks spouting spontaneous rays of brilliant light.
This beauty will make you starve...
You will thirst for such immaculate scenes as this.
You may search the barren desert,
or the depths of the grat sea,
and the ony thing able to quench your thirst,
is seeing your reflection in her eyes."

They are fast + fierce devouring energy
The tribe feed on blood + spirit
Created from primordial soup, they thrive in the forest
Waiting for a lost soul to wander their dark depths
The people of the trees are restless for night to come
Hiding from the morning sun to slip away into a deep sleep
Hold this sweet slumber close
The end is cold and near
Crisp like the winter wind
It sends the frigid air to your bones ignroing your pourous skin.
You posess an ancient beauty that has gone unseven for generations
Liberate your feelings and ignore societies wishes
Why must a flower have a stem if the sky can be with out clouds?"

Suspended in the thin crisp air
Dangling by the thin silver cord

Ill live in the clouds

Find me the light in this world
My eyes see only the tormented
My ears hear only the uncooth
The divine senses that prouce images for my mind to feast on send chills down my spine
Is this ancient story true?
Blind faith seems ignorant at times
And other times there is no option
Place your life into the hands of the great unknown..
There is no repentence for her...
The source of evil for this mortal world is her twisted heart.
Feeding on pain she thrives for tears and sobbing
Her Fufillment brings only darkness
SHe moves through the night soft and swift...
In the dark she comes for me...
I know not fear, only anger..
End the show
The close of the curtain..."

They were just a bunch of wussy Christian Private School boys.  On Saturday I went out to dinner with Erin and Lauren.  On the way to the party I ate some really good mushrooms from California.  I started tripping before we got there.  Just as we pulled up they were lighting a blunt on the porch.  I got in the circle and started smoking.  After the blunt I was started to trip really hard core.  I went in and talked to Baldwin for a while.  I dont remeber a thing he said.  I smoked a blunt sized doobie with him and some older drunk dude.  I went and layed on the ground by the TV and stared up at the ceiling.  It turned into all of these pringles guys with mustaches eating eachothers heads and stuff.  I layed there for an hour imaculately entertained.  Kyle called my phone and asked me where I was so he could pick me up.  I was so confused I didnt even know where I was.  I had some girl tell him how to get there.  Then he picked me up and we went to rashids for a party.  We hung out there for a while then walked to Kyles house for the night.  I had to carry Kyle home while I was tripping hard.  I had him on my back and all I could see in the darkness were glowing pink math equations.  It all lasted till about 4 in the morning.  9-4 not bad.  What a night..."

It included him dressing up as a penguin at Meijers, a visit to Chuckey Cheeses and some other assorted things.  Then we had a suprise party for some chick back at his dorms.  We left at like 1:00 to go and break in to Brandons house.  We put the video camera we had on night vision and snuck up stairs.  Brandon was having some people over so we started fucking with them.  We started tickeling this kids ear with a piece of grass while he was asleep.. he woke up really quick scared and confused.. We drank a bunch of whiskey with them then left.  We went over to Dwaynes at like 4:00 in the morning and went in his hot tub.  Chris said to run if he came.  We got back to Brandons around 5 then crashed on a couch.  
Saturday came around and I found some Hydro shit for me and chris.  We played disc golf twice then he dropped me off at my house.  I had a sweet ass weekend.  Yesterday, I hung out with Piankai and a bunch of cokeheads.. Me and Jim watched these kids do line after line.  It was offered but I didnt want any.  We rolled a 51er with that hydro and got messed up for the rest of the day.  I had sooooo much fun this weekend.  I wish I had someone to share all these experiences with. It almost makes me want to go back to where I was a year ago ( and who I was with).  This solitude is killing me, but Ill never go back to that.  Not ever."

Somthing dawned on me while I was walking to class today.  Why not go for the most gorgeous girl in the school if  shes what you want.  If she has all the qualities that youre looking for then whats the worst that could happen?  Hearing the word ""no"" isnt so bad.  Everyone hears it many times every day, yet there is no mental damage done.  Get some balls.. go after that supermodel, you've got nothing to lose.  If they're stuck up, then you wouldnt want to be with someone like that anyways.  
  Women are such beautiful creatures. They have the advantage over men in many ways.  IN nature, when two animals eyes meet, the weaker of the two looks away first.  Thats where women have the advantage.  When a mans eyes meet with a womens it is a compitition.  Mens eyes are naturally drawn to womens  breast.  Look at the breast for instance.  You have the entire breast, which forms a perfect symmetrical circle.  Then the areola which forms a perfect circle inside of the larger one.  And finally the nipple, the center of the three circles.  Now, step back and think about it.  Womens breast are symetrical bullseyes.  Their bodies form perfect lines that direct you where to go.  They ""V"" thats formed near the hips is a perfect arrow just screaming ""go here, touch here!""  Women are such a nobel species.  They carry on your name on after you die.  I love women."

"event","School...
Dark corners filled with unamused souls
Mindless zombies 
Forced Physical attendance
No mental requirements
Theyre all pigs 
Even the good are pigs
Ignorance fills the halls like a lingering stench
GOD DAMN SHE LOOKS GOOD...
Still a pig
Swine."

"event","An emptyness
Deepth within the depths of my soul
Once filled with you
Once filled and protected by Summer rays
Seasons change
And I an empty
Summers lent protection ran out on me O too quickly
Im waiting impaciently
Till I see your face once again
Till I feel your grace once again
Im left empty
Empty to this world that offers little love
It would rather kill me
Than nourish me
Pain and self anguish are brought in with the cold winter wind...
There is no light in this darkness"

i'm not sure which i'm more excited about. god, i love brushing my teeth

all i need now is a new purse heheh

so what i really wanted to ask is this:

WHY are /people/ in love with the IDEA of being in love?? i truly do NOT understand that

and those /people/ scare me"

"event","the sky hangs heavy tonight 
but no more so than the conversation we won't have 
we lie down one more time
side by side
letting the grass run through our fingers 
sending familiar chills through our arms
trying desperately to feel
plagued by death
and plagued by life
we drift our separate ways
i fill your lungs with dreams
you promise to not exhale
quiet is nearing
it humbles us with truth
and swallows time with grace"

"event","didn't feel like posting this in myspace b/c only a few people know of my LJ and i like it that way.

i almost never remember my dreams, but when i do they're fairly strange

people in my dreams always change. like they keep the same appearance, but they're really someone else? and sometimes i'm different too, but i know its me

anyway, i was at some sort of a mall and an older man was staring at me all too much. he was creepy and as i was walking to the washroom he asked if id sit to have a bite with him. i gave a smile and said no thank you and proceeded to the washroom that turned out to be huge and more like a locker room. i was the only person in there of course and when i went in there i had 3 shards of a broken mirror that i was holding in my hand. i was trying to piece them together...it made the shape of my heart. it was my heart. someone came in and it was the old man. i knew it. i could see him through an opening of a door that hadn't shut completely. he was waiting for me. i planned to not act completely freaked out and just casually walk out, but with speed. out of no where there was another man, but i knew that he was good. i made it clear i was in danger and pretty much hid behind this 'good' man though he was confused. the old man approached us slowly and stabbed the man standing infront of me. i cant remember what happened after that. but i know the old mans intentions were to rape and kill me. there was a lot more to this dream...where people transformed and such. i can't even begin to really explain any of my dreams as is. none of them are really clear or simple and they either feel too real like i was there or they are so fucking out of this world, but yet feel like they took place in a state of mind or otherwise that does exist

dreams are trippy"

The managers, the food, the outfits (NO FUCKING HAWAIIN SHIRTS!) the servers, the hosts and everyone and their cousin has a new g/f or b/f. It's still home though and my friends are still there so it's all good. I'm going to L.A. the end of the month. I'm SO excited you have no idea. I'm going to see Kyle, her and Tiffany! A lot of my friends seem to be gorgeous I realized. It's sickening. Strange thing is Tiffany is originally from MN and we know some of the same people and we're both going to be in MN all of Oct so we're hanging out. She seems really cool. Anyway, I've been making some more friends and just talking to Kyle a lot. Nothing else is really new. I'm in town this weekend, but I'm already busy. I have a shower, bachelorette party and quality Alicia E. time, family time annnd possibly Lauren time IF it pours like a mofo and she doesn't go CAMPING. hahaha. love you guys. ill be back in Chi on sun night. ciao"

I'm almost never surprised by anything, but things as of late in my life are definitely crazy (in a good way) but things I had only imagined. I've made a few new friends from L.A. and Hollywood so that's been interesting. I love making new friends. Kyle and I have been talking for a while now. I talk to Kyle more than I talk to her though. is there something wrong with this pic? I went to the Dr. today and also to work. Bad new from the doc. I'm still sick and can't return to work until Tues! I'm not too happy about that, but I suppose I'm not exactly healthy yet. I've been pretty anti-social since I came back, but I'm sure that will change when I feel better. I went to see Britt @ FUCK today and it was nice seeing her. I'm laying low tonight. I watched The Notebook, took a nap and have been talking with Kyle and am waiting for her to call or whatever. Who knows what tomorrow brings. I was thinking of going out to L.A. randomly for Kyle's HUGE party and to see her and friends. I doubt I go just b/c I don't know how much fun I'll be while I'm still sick and I just got back home. Hope everything is going well for everyone else"

I also ran into a few old friends I hadn't seen in a long time so that was really nice at least. I hung out with Lauren the other night and that was a pleasure as usual. I went to the dr, ran errands with my mom today and then hung out with Alicia. I get my tonsils taken out Oct. 9th and I'm not looking forward to it. I'll be home for THREE god damn weeks!! Ugh. Anyway, Alicia and I watched Wicker Park and I must say that was a little strange, but I really liked it!! OMG, I bought a lot of makeup/hair products today and I realized that FORD pays for it all. YESSSSS! This is a great thing b/c I definitely have ""expensive"" taste at times. I've discovered that I love Samy and I've fallen in love with this wax spray by TIGI BedHead. It's AMAZING! I also bought the 2nd season of The O.C annnnd my friends show, Laguna Beach. Why? B/c it's wonderful, MINDLESS t.v watching lol. I'm going to L.A. soon after I get my tonsils out. I'm sooooo freaking excited!! I got a cute new digi cam and it's on a keychain lol. It's so tiny. I sound like an OC girl right about now. I'll excuse myself now. I miss her. Life's good. The end."

"event","love isn't safe. but if you always play it safe where does that leave room to really live? without taking a chance you have nothing to gain nor lose. change is the one thing in life you can count on to be consistent. things in life including people and feelings are temporary until proven otherwise. when you embrace this realization only then can you love and live life whole heartedly. love purely and unselfishly knowing that anything is possible and you could lose that very person you give your all to, but lose them knowing you loved them with everything you could. what comfort lies in promises? forever and never cannot be measured by time, but only felt. no one is safe. find comfort in that. find comfort in now so you make the most of what you have when you have it. living by and for the moment isn't so crazy. it's all we really have. the only thing that will ever be telling is time. the world awaits. life is good."

"event","""Best Of You""

I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you

Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Are you gone and onto someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Oh...

Oh...Oh...Oh...Oh...

Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
The life, the love
You die to heal
The hope that starts
The broken hearts
You trust, you must
Confess

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

I've got another confession my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new

Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

I finished watching the first season of the o.c. haha and talked with alicia a lot. i didnt plan on going out tonight, but last minute Yoli text me to come out so i rolled out of bed and ended up going to Spin, Hydrate, Circuit and Melrose. I just got in and once again it's almost 6am. i'm tired and of course i was outside when it poured like no tomorrow. it was raining so damn much i couldnt see a damn thing. brrrrr its cold! im tired now and really full. blah. and of course i was reminded of Britt b/c of Melrose since that was one of the first places that we went to eat -sigh- yeah, anyway, Yoli sorta knows Kristin and this other girl I was with knows Cate. Fun stuff. at least we're all 'friends' now though. Spin and Hydrate were horrible tonight..infact all the clubs were horrible. I think right now the only club i sorta like is Funky Buddha. I might be going to Blu though tomorrow...we'll see how i feel. im tired now. goodnight!"

"event","This is going to be a novel. I have so much running through my head. I think all this time off work and away from friends is getting to me. I miss Lauren like crazy. Last night all the memories came flooding to me. There was literally thousands and they never end. Time. It serves what purpose. In seeing and remembering all these images I was reminded that I'll never forget how I felt at the time. I remember how nervous I was picking her up at the airport and how uncomfortable Alicia felt and how I knew I should care and be so reassuring and I wasn't and didn't care so much. I remember the glasses, the white pants, the big red purse, the tiny teeth and the quiet chuckles out of awkwardness. I remember how she was so quiet, reserved and seemingly fragile. She'd always dress nice and we'd brush our teeth about 6 times a day and I usually still do. She'd always wear those red pjs from Victorias that would be falling off her. She'd always smell like Burberry. There were so many moments of awkwardness. She'd barely eat a thing and how she loved her grape juice...the red kind. And then there was the sushi. God, it wasn't as awful as i had imagined, but it was still gross. All the e-mails. Our entire friendship. It feels like it's been years. Remembering how it all came to be. We used to talk nearly all hours of the day and night. Jace. And then the truth coming out and us becoming the best of friends. She always came first. I always looked forward to hearing from my Jauren. And then I got engaged and things became even more difficult. I remember being in Moorhead, but we were still each others top priorities. I loved my best friend more than anything. Talking on the phone with her was so great. We'd talk about the most stupid, pointless, crazy things...to more important things that didn't seem as significant at the time but were. We used to cam whore it all the time. There was always this look about her and always will be. It's just Lauren. No one really knows what to make of it. It's just her. Her looks must be part of her charm. I remember the pain. The heartache. The longing. There was such a sadness. I remember holding each other. Just barely gracing each other with a gentle touch of the fingertips and it feeling so overwhelming and wanting so much more. I remember first holding hands. Cuddling. The kisses everywhere on the face, but on the lips that I don't think could have been felt more or meant more. I remember how hard it was hearing her say she couldn't look at me and knowing why. At one point we couldnt sit by each other. Our first kisses. The madness. Wanting to cry of happiness and of sadness for what was to come. We'd talk so often online and on the phone. i remember missing her so much and worrying about her. i remember how happy i would be to see her on and to talk with her. I remember her always working on her art work for school until the early hours. I remember how we'd count down the days until we would see each other again. sleeping with her and waking up next to her felt like home. i remember the presents she gave me. the card she wrote me. something about me was home to her. and that we had a bond like no other. i remember the things i got for her as well and how i felt when i was looking for these gifts for her...almost having put too much thought into such little things. the showers. the kisses. and i remember the fall. i remember that sinking feeling. i remember when time stood still and the world as i knew it came to a complete halt. i remember when everything became surreal. my life was being told to me. i remember the calmness to it all. i remember the tears. seeing her cry. the lies. after it all there were still lies to spare my feelings. i remember the anger towards my best friend. and i remember not being able to be angry b/c of loving her so much and b/c of that being so understanding. i remember the confusion. she'd already started to walk that plank and once you start you often feel like you cant turn back so you might as well jump and take the fall. for a while i remember feeling like i didnt recognize her. the priorities changed. people stopped hearing from her. i remember thinking to myself that she had taken on someone elses life. he saved her from her life...so now whose life is she really living? so many contraditions. but we'd all just rather not think about it. live carelessly. live any life, but the one that she was. somewhere in the midst of it all i lost my best friend. i miss that friendship more than anything. i just miss her in ways i cant explain. its not that i miss having her. i just miss us. and while i would cry myself to sleep filled with all these memories i ended up having several dreams...about britt. they were very distorted and hard to remember. they were so strange. part of me misses something about her. its not having someones company that i miss. i have that if i want it and ive learned that i certainly dont. its only been a week and wherever ive gone out at night people have been coming up to me and buying me drinks, talking with me and such. ive exchanged numbers, talked with people and such and everyone has been so nice and im just not interested in any of them. if anything being single and going out and running into all these people who are interested in going out on a date with me has turned me away from people in the meantime. ive been trying to make new friends and its just not good timing. i spent the entire day inside by myself yesterday and i might do it again tonight. ill probably force myself to go out, but i just know what awaits me out there and its not appealing. all the girls and guys might i add that i run into im very much not interested in. im not sure why, but im just not. though my relationship/friendship with britt was always so incredibly difficult, trying, stressful, dramatic...there was probably a reason for it all and somewhere in between all that there was an odd comfort, happiness and fun. hands down theres no one quite like the girl. she's one of a kind and at times was beyond me. its almost as if there were on and off switches to her. different personalities or something. different tones of voices, different attitudes, different facial expressions. her mannerisms, the pace in which she talked and you could always see it in her eyes. there would be so much attitude and such a mouth on her at times, but you would know by looking at her eyes that it was out of hurt. or her smirks. the quick, awkward and crooked smirk of hers when she was really sad. there are few times when you will see that girl smile when its real and she's truly happy. i remember that the few times i did see it was when we were first talking. her and i would talk at all hours of the night as well and we'd cam whore it. i remember first seeing her and how she was complaining about how she had bedhead and her fohawk was messed up when really she probably just fixed it right before getting on cam lol. and i remember she was wearing her red hoodie, and her hair looked amazing and she looked so small and innocent and she could just not stop smiling. she's so strange. young. difficult. full of surprises. she'd drive you crazy. its always a love/hate thing with her. like you just want to kill/kiss her. i miss her odd ways sometimes. there was always something more to her. she acted so strange for a reason. im not convinced thats really her. she knows what ""normal"" is. i think part of her knows what shes doing...she just doesnt always know why. and then theres alicia. yes, engbrecht though. im talking to her now. its so strange how things work out. she was my first girlfriend. the first person i was ever in love with and one of my first real best friends. we're becoming good friends again now. its so nice seeing her. we're actually talking now. i should probably go. it took me years to get over her just as im sure it will take me years to get over lauren, if not longer. ill write more later. i should go out tonight. hope everyone is doing well. ciao"

Cate and I actually hung out for a bit and ended up going to Four together. Cate is a really awesome person so far and we straightened our misunderstandings out. Hopefully Cate and I will be able to at least be friends. I'm glad that she knows it was never my intention to upset her anyway. Tonight was really intersting seeing how Cate is. She means well and is a most wonderful person, but I can see how now just isn't the time for her probably to be with anyone...she's doing her thing and having fun. Whatever. We're all having fun as we probably should be. I'm a bit tipsy still. I need to eat and pass the fuck out. Oh yeah, Katrina...hair piece=TINY white and black skirt. Remember? Yeah.

"event","Okay. So can I just say that I've fallen in love with the yo crunch oreo yogurt? I just walked in the door from running all my errands. Today was productive and I'm happy. Not everything got done that needed to be, but still a lot of things did get done/paid! So I'm finally home now on my day off which is nice b/c it wont happen again the rest of the week, but whatever. I'm supposed to be going to Hydrate tonight, but we'll see. I probably will go out tonight just b/c I don't work till late tomorrow, but I've gone out every single night this fucking week I think. It's also possible i'm becoming a slight alcoholic. My tolerance has definitely gone up. I had 3 drinks and 2 shots right away last night and absolutely nothing happened...ever. That and you know you have problems when you're at home alone drinking by yourself haha. I made a drink with my LUNCHABLE. Is there something wrong with this picture? it's a really yummy drink though. i fear drinking alcohol is becoming much like water to me. im not worried yet though. this week is going to be busy. im so bored right now. it feels so good though to have a moment where i know i really dont HAVE to do anything and i can wait a couple hours before i need to get ready. i just need to stop spending money though. i took a taxi everywhere today...it was bad. i talked to britt on the phone today. yeah. that was a little strange. i think im at that stage where you notice every mother fucking thing around you that reminds you of them. i hate that. and it doesnt matter like who youre with really...at some point there are just certain things that will catch your eye or just remind you of that person. even though im talking to other people and having a great time with friends and things are overall good...im still caught up in that stage for now. but then again who wouldnt be, right? i mean im not going to lie. if i got over her like in a day that would be wrong and very telling of how little i really cared. its not going to be easy. thats all i know. but its in the works. note to self: malibu doesnt taste yummy with oreo yogurt. okay. so im really looking forward to going home. theres something about it that just brings out the best in me. im really wanting to just have some time to myself or whatever and going back to see my friends ive had forever. i miss sitting out on my porch or the deck alone and i really miss the nights out on my rooftop just sitting there thinking about nothing or everything...looking out at countless stars. sometimes we really get caught up living around the clock especially in a fast paced city like Chicago. we all run around the clock and often times miss the little things that count--everything in between. the bar scene gets old real fast. i think mellennium park and the little coffee houses may become my place of solace. i think i may write some today. i have a lot on my mind. im getting to know someone, but i think its wise and makes sense to really be single for quite some time. its hard trying to figure out who might be real friends...its hard finding people who can keep it real and stay consistent. itd be nice to have good people in your life who you can trust are for real. i need to go lie down. ciao"

So a lot is going on I guess. I had a ton of things I really needed to do today and NONE of it got done. I'm really disappointed in myself about that, but they will definitely get done soon. I'm going to be visiting home August 12th-15th so I'm really excited about that. I don't have too many plans so I'll have time to be able to just relax and see more of my good friends. Lauren and I are going to Jesse's show at the Varsity Theater that I'm really looking forward to. This weekend will hopefully be really fun and something that I need. I think a lot of my girls are going out partying this weekend and we're just going to have a good time and it will probably be good for me. I think Lauren and I may get some coffee this weekend and I think Colleen will be joining some of us girls in a few parties this weekend since she can't get into the bars/clubs at the moment. britt and i have taken a turn for the worse for lack of better word. i'm not sure what we are if anything...meaning I don't think we're even friends. I asked her to leave my place b/c right now I think it's for the best for both of us. We're no longer dating and right now it seems like we cannot be friends. she's moving out next week and right now things are not the best. i went to work tonight to visit my friends...i got to see colleen, lauren and dine so that was really nice. i had one expensive dinner and talked to colleen forever lol. it was fucking cold in there and soooo nice to not be working!! i just got home and now i need to do laundry before either partying, go to the bars with some friends or...sleep. we'll see. anyway, better days to come. cest la vie. take care"

They're one of the top modeling agencies in the world so this has been quite the opportunity that I'm so incredibly grateful for. I'm still beside myself and I could not be happier about this. I am making even more friends at work and becoming closer with the ones I already have. Britt and I went to the Gravy Train concert this weekend with some of her friends and last night we went to the bar with my friends from work and then to Colins house to drink more and I watched Jenna and Britt play pool which was very entertaining lol. Everything is honestly so amazing and incredible now. I have a job, I'm starting my career, I have my own place and it's been a good transition taking on more resonsibilities in these new chapters of my life. I miss my friends back home, but I know that we will keep in touch and I will be coming home some time next month as well. I'm going to watch a movie with Britt now so I have to go.

It was very interesting to say the least. I will go into more detail later. Anyway I saw Lauren quite a bit and holy shit has she changed. She looks extremely different is what I really mean to say. It was really good to see her though and made for a lot of awkward situations at my family birthday and even with my friends, but it was still good to see her. We tried to catch up on our summers and we did get to hang out some. Other HUGE news is that I'm going to be modeling with FORD. I don't know what else to say, but holy shit I'm happy and so is everyone else who loves me. This is amazing and what I love to do in life and this is a wonderful agency that will forever help out my career. Other news...last night was so fucking fun. Half my work went out to 2 bars/clubs and had a blast. It was CRAZY. Britt moves in tomorrow. yes, you read that correctly. She's moving in with me for a month b/c she needs a place to stay. I go into FORD tomorrow and then we're going out to eat and to Spin. Yay. I need to pack and clean up now. hope all is well. things couldnt be better here. xx"

Lauren, Lindsay and I were pretty much the only ones to actually clean and then Lauren and I just talked a lot which was a good time. Last night we had this reopening VIP party at work so the place was hella busy, but definitely fun times. Britt stayed over last night and we watched some movies and I had a really nice time. It was nice just being able to relax with her, watch some movies, eat popcorn and have a good time. The movies we watched were a little fucked up, but that's okay...Britt picked them out and I still had so much fun.

Courtney, Jenna, Lauren, Tirrell, Jamie, Colin and Lisa are all really fun people to work with and I'm starting to get to know them better/making plans and such. I'm really excited for Monday!! That night a lot of people from work are going out to the bars with me so that will be fun along with Britt & Brenda (of course!) and hopefully a few other people from UIC. I also plan to hang out with Jenna and Lauren some other time soon. Today I went to the beach with Britt and we had a good time. She came over to my place last night to talk things over and I ended up staying there the night and then today we got a decent tan and I have sand all over me still lol hence why I feel sticky. I'm still here actually. We just got some Coldstone and ate some left over pasta from last night at the Cheesecake Factory. I'm about to head home though b/c I need to go to bed early to wake up at 5:30 for some gay ass meeting at work...which is really us cleaning the place for hours. Blah.

Britt and I are officially together so we're back to our exclusive/monogamous relationship and hopeful that it will be long term. We went on a beautiful carriage ride through town and had a wonderful dinner at Grand Lux. During the ride Britt gave me an early birthday present and asked me to be her girlfriend. She bought be an extremely beautiful Tiffany ring that I absolutely love. The night with her was so nice, and then more shitty things happened b/c my head wasn't screwed on yesterday, but overall it ended up being such a better day b/c of Britt (Thanks, honey). Tonight we're going to go out with some friends to Mambos for drinks and whatever and I'm going with Britt for her Dr appointment after I get my haircut and she gets off work. I went to the doctor today and got all sorts of meds. I really shouldn't be going out tonight, but whatever. I have so many meds the dr gave me that I'm pretty sure I'll be better in no time. I'm supposed to go to a photo shoot on Sat during the day while Britt is at work and I might still go depending on what time and how I feel. Britt and I were invited to model for NASCAR on Sat all morning, day and night though which would be nice, but it's my one day off my other job and Britt and I are going to see a movie together since we don't often get to go out just the two of us with both our work schedules these days.

I went to the hospital today, but the urgent care was at least a SIX hour wait--so fuck that. They gave me a number though where I'll be able to find like an ear, nose & throat doctor who I can make an appointment with SOON. I didn't go to work today b/c I was so sick. I was embarrassed the other day at work b/c some of the guests were asking if I was okay (basically concerned if I was going to get them sick I'm sure) b/c I was coughing so hard it sounded like I was choking to death. What else...I went to the Taste of Chicago w/some friends from UIC and holy hell it was a NIGHTMARE. It was like the Taste of MN times 20. You pretty much couldn't walk and people were all so bitchy and it was just stressful. Britt and I lost Brenda/friends and spent the rest of the night looking for them and never found them again, but whatever. I suppose it could have been worse? And then I got REALLY sick that night to top it all off. Things with Tasha are kind of up in the air I guess. I have yet to call her back today. Chris is a really a really great guy so far and I'm hoping we'll become closer friends. I can't believe how soon Britt and I are coming up there! I'm not going to lie...I'm pretty excited to see all my friends back home! It will be nice to see Katrina, Alicia, Katie Mae, Lauren, Ang, Tony and all them!! I talked to Lauren for a little while today and she's acting a little strange as of late. I never seem to know wtf is going on with her, but I miss her. Britt is talking to this girl, Cate so who knows what's going on with us. I guess we're sort of dating or something, but we're able to date other people obviously...so I think she's sort of dating Cate too and it's just weird to me b/c I've never just dated people before. I'v been hesitant with talking to too many other people, but since she's talking with Cate then I guess I should just go for it and see other people. I think things will be a lot different once I return to Chicago and I'm 21. I'm hopeful of meeting some new people and just whatever. I really want to make new friends more than anything. This coming year is going to be one hell of a year...I can feel it. I'm hoping to still go to Europe this year even though it wont be with Lauren. I anticipate a long year of working after this summer and going out to the bars a lot or something. I think I'm going to go shower and try to relax. I miss all my friends and I will see you guys soon"

The hosts do a hell of a lot more than seat people at this place and we're in charge of way more than I'm used to. The first day wasn't so bad. I'm already making new friends who I'm going to be clubbing with in a few weeks and I work with 3 lesbians and 1 gay guy. They're all really awesome so far and I love it! Today, however I did a lot of serving and it was tiring and I did a bunch of to go orders and that's complicated on the stupid micro, but whatever. I have tomorrow off (thank god) and I'm going to the taste with Brenda and a bunch of people from UIC so that should be fun before I have a full fucking week of work. I don't have off again until Sat and that day I was considering doing some model thing for NASCAR, but it says it's like all fucking day starting at 7am and honestly I don't think I want to spend my one day off like that and having to get up at the crack of dawn as usual. Oh well. We'll see what happens. I'm at Brenda's/Britt's right now. It seems like I'm here a lot lol. I love them though and I doubt I'm here at all next week but we'll see how tired I am. Tonight there's some party Britt and I were invited to, but I have a feeling we're not going. I was supposed to be drinking with Brenda, Chris and whoever else but Chris has to work a horrible double tomorrow and he's coming up on Mon night anyway I guess so it's all good. Brenda and I are both feeling sick as hell anyway so we might just have a chill night in? Or she might go home so I'll be here by myself tonight lol and I'll probably just watch tv or something? I have a migraine right now and I still have strep so that's probably why I don't feel so hot. Sorry for all the bitching. It's just been one of those days? I miss home and I can't wait to visit!

Just about everything that could have possibly went wrong did...no joke. It was really stressful and my mom was driving me crazy b/c she was more stressed than I was! I love her, but UGH. Everything is okay though now. My place is a bit of a mess right now and I haven't put everything away, but I will sometime this week. I've pretty much been trying to enjoy my last week before I start working full time again. Blah. I went to Chicago PRIDE on Sunday w/Brenda and we attempted to meet up w/some others, but that didn't work out so well and then we went out to eat at this yummy pizza place! Later we went to some lesbian, 21+ after party that was like a ""club"" outside and whatever. Britt and her friends were there and everyone was shit faced pretty much and there was some serious drama that night like no other that I will hopefully forget about someday. Overall it was a good time though. Everyone ended up being okay after hell broke loose first and then we ended up going to Cate's house after and drinking some more lol. I've been drinking a lot w/new people lately. It's been fun though. The other night I hung out with a bunch of the staff here at UIC lol. We were playing football and drinking outside at like 2am and got invited to go to the Taste of Chicago and the 4th w/them so that was nice. It seems like it wont be too hard making friends around here. I'm sure that I will make a lot of friends from work though. I'm just really happy that I have Britt and Brenda as my good friends. What else has been going on...so much has been going on I honestly can't keep up w/my own life. I just woke up and we had a bit to drink last night so I'm not the brighest crayon in the box right now. Lauren is leaving for MN on Friday so watch out, Minnnesotans. Britt and I are still coming up on the 15th, but we're not together at all. We're both very mcuh single and it's hard, but I don't know I guess that's just the way it is. Her last ex is single again and still has feelings for Britt and then there's Cate who I know Britt is attracted to and I wouldn't be surprised if Cate was attracted to her, but these are all good things for Britt I think? It's probably best that we both move on. Me personally, I don't think I'm going to be dating anyone for quite some time. I don't like going out on dates and it seems like I should just stay away from that for a while. I'm not talking to anyone or anything and I don't plan to. Anything could happen, but we'll see. You never know b/c I'll meet a lot of people at work and in less than a month I'll be able to hit up all the clubs and hopefully I'll meet some cool people there? it'd be nice to make a few more friends anyway. Mkay. I'm really tired still for some reason. I think I'm going to go back to bed seeing as it's 9am and i dont remember what time i passed out this morning. Oh yeah, I got a new laptop and my DSL will be hooked up in like 4 days so i totally lied. I will have an aol account so ill have my normal e-mail back and ill probably always be signed on even though ill probably always be at work! Whatever. i'm just happy ill be able to stay in touch with everyone more often. I hope everything is going well wherever you all are. love love. ciao"

"event","It's final. I have my own place here in Chicago!! I got a ""large"" studio at this Sheridan complex that's about 7 miles north of downtown Chicago which is really nice since I work downtown. I move in on Friday. I can't wait to see my mom and Denny!! They're going to be staying the weekend to help me move my things in and buy my furniture at Ikea!! It feels so good to have that done with. I already made my security deposit and I pay first months rent on Friday. Tony is coming to visit sometime soon I think and hopefully Katrina will too! Any of you are welcome to come visit me sometime. Things w/Britt are better. Brenda, Britt and I went to my place yesterday and then spent a good amount of time downtown which is always fun. Britt and I will still be coming up on the 15th so plan for a busy weekend! I'm really not sure what's up with us b/c I just never know. She may like someone else and that's okay. We'll just see what happens I guess. We're going out to eat with my parents this weekend though so hopefully that will be a good time. I got a rather lengthy e-mail the other day from Lauren which was really nice. She's extremely busy these days and planning on attending school back home (Mpls) which is really good for her. She's very happy and hopefully I'll get to see her next month. I have a lot to do today and I'm procrastinating -sigh- I need to look up furniture now for my mom b/c she's impatient. Love you all. Ciao"

These fibers still feel and so they will remember the details by touch. The silence goes unbroken. A solitary tear will speak for itself and remain unfounded in the dark."

"event","I feel really exhausted in every sense of the word tonight. I'm hurting physically and emotionally today so that's fantastic! My mom bought Britt and I plane tickets today so I will for sure be home July 15th-18th. Britt and I went to look at an apartment today and um it ended up being really creepy and tiny. Today was just stressful. It was a bitch getting to the apartment and before that we spent quite some time looking for a Wells Fargo that doesn't fucking exist. I was really upset to say the least. It was really fun. The movie was great though and things seemed to be going really well with Britt. I cannot seem to find consistency in that though and it has me concerned. I am really confused right now so I guess we'll see what happens. It was my aunt's birthday today so I'm pretty sad about that right now. I wish that I could have been there and I feel really guilty and sad for not seeing her in forever. I know that I should have, but I didn't and I know I have a problem with things like that. I'm worried she won't be there when I come home."

"event","That's exactly how I feel. So I guess I'm for sure staying in Chicago. I went into Fridays today (by myself) and I start work again on July 1st. Britt and I are for sure coming up on July 15th and we'll be leaving the evening of the 18th! (my 21st) yay? I have 2 weeks to find a place to live and in the mean time I'll continue to stay w/Britt and Brenda. Things have been pretty fucking crazy...I'm not going to lie and then again this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. Things have been so damn strange. I'm talking to Tasha quite a bit which is funny b/c I never really saw that coming. Lauren and I are talking pretty minimal right now. Last we talked was the night from hell -closes eyes- I would so love to forget that ever happened. Anyway. I'm starting to become friends w/Brenda which is nice. Hopefully I'll make some friends from work too. Umm things with Britt--Yeah, I know everyone wants to know wtf is going on or what even happened. It's so LdFGkJW5fU that i don't even want to go there. YIKES is what I have to say. I'm not sure what to think. Technically we're just friends, but um...yeah, we don't really act like it and the odd thing is we never have -shrug- who knows. Mmmm. I'm tired. I shouldnt be though. Whatever. Hope everyone is doing well. God, don't call me unless its a weekend or after 9pm. my phone got shut off the other day b/c i went over my limit like whoa. kayz. ciao"

"event","life is a bitch. That's totally nothing new though. Britt and I are no longer together. It's rough. Everything is uncertain right now I guess. Hopefully I'm able to go to Fridays tomorrow and figure out if I can still work there if I end up wanting to stay here regardless. Things are always complicated. Feelings are still there between the both of us. Long story. I won't even go there -sigh- Maybe I'll just get a place in Minneapolis who knows. Part of me really wants to stay here..."

"event","I'm still alive. Things are kind of crazy. I guess things are starting to feel surreal. Things with Britt and I have been amazing, but I don't know. There's always potential for some drama bullshit that I'm just not having. You know? Things are really serious though and we're going to talk about that tonight so we'll see. I'm really happy with her though and she says she's in love w/me so time will just be telling. I need to learn how to trust people again. I went to a party last night and wtf I don't remember what else we've been doing. We've been around town quite a bit and we're going to another party tonight and the beach some other day and I think they go to the clubs almost every night. It'll be fun. It seems like I could get myself into some trouble, but I won't. Hopefully I start work soon and I think at some time today we're going to talk to some people who help you find apartments. Whatever. Just thought I'd leave a little update. Britt and I will be coming into town on the 15th of July-18th for my 21st. I expect everyone to be there. I think we're just going downtown and doing whatever all night. Oh yeah, Lauren is moving to Minneapolis next month with Will. Crazy, isnt it? We're sort of still friends. It's hard b/c we barely talk and I'm not sure if I know her anymore? I guess we'll see. Hope everyone is doing well. Call me sometime AFTER 9pm or on the WEEKENDS b/c I think I'm starting to have outrageous phone bills and I can't keep having ones that are over 1k b/c um I will definitely be on the streets in no time then haha. Mkay, I need to get ready. ciao"

"event","Why am I awake? I worked 10 hours today. I got off at midnight and then ran home to change and went out to Perkins with Katrina, Michelle and Anne and then went to Katrina's after for a little bit. I hadn't been to Perkins in forever and it's so ghetto! Good times though. You can always look forward to guys hitting on you. Yay. Right. So things are pretty much set for my move aside from the fact I haven't started packing and I can only bring 2 suitcases so my mom is going to have to UPS a ton of things like my clothes. I will be working at the Fridays in downtown Chicago. Wooo! how not exciting. Oh yeah, I got another modeling job though so that's cool? I'm getting paid well and I go to orientation for it on the 11th and then the event is on the 16th. I'm getting paid to look sexy and party with a bunch of wealthy guys. All I do is talk to them and just see how their night is going for 5 hours. It's easy enough for me and a lot of them are important people in the industry so hopefully they like me and ask me to do some shoots or whatever. I still need a permanent place to stay though. I probably wont have a roommate. It looks like I may just get a studio for $600/mo and Britt will probably live w/me basically. I think that if I get the studio though that I'll only be able to pay my rent, phone bill and get a few groceries here and there lol. Oh man. But I guess that's where I just cross my fingers and hope I can catch some breaks with modeling. I need to go shopping before I move. I am going to Abercrombie to get some jeans and then whatever else. I need some fucking bras that fit right. Bras really suck I've decided. None of them fit right and I'm like between a B and a C depending on the designer so it just doesn't work out for me so well. So it's 4 something in the morning and normally I'm still awake, but for some reason I feel tired tonight. I just got home and I have been going since this morning of course. I need to wake up in 3 hours and I work a lot today/tonight too. I have so much shit to do. I have to wake up so early to get my damn pant suit altered and then I get my hair cut and colored!! Thank god b/c I seriously needed it. I was going to go out with Engbrecht, but honestly I don't know that I'll have the time or energy before work. I should probably take a nap if I have any time. I need to go to the bank and I swear I should probably start to pack soon. Mkay. I'm totally going to regret writing this later b/c I'm so fucking tired I don't know wtf I'm saying lol. Wow. I promise I'm not drunk or anything...just extremely sleep deprived and have been for a good couple months now. I feel cracked out. Love you all. Ciaoz"

"event","I am moving next Thurs to Chicago. I have to work a double today and Friday, then I work 5-10pm Sat, 5-12am Sunday and Tues. I will have some of Monday and Wed to say goodbye to people, but I also have a few things I need to take care of like packing, haircut, renewing my license and whatever else. I guess I probably wont have a roommate. I think I'm just going to get a studio and Britt is pretty much going to be living with me. I'm so fucking nervous/excited! I start looking for apartments as soon as I get there. I've started to look already so hopefully I'll be able to move before the 30th or my ass might be on the streets. I put a week notice in with work and I'm waiting to hear that I was transferred to the Fridays in Chicago. I better have been and I won't start there for a few weeks. Modeling is stressing me out like whoa. I basically am starting over and with nothing. I'm going to have a new place of my own, in a new city, living with a new girlfriend and having a new career or whatever. How fucking crazy is this? I'm out of my mind, but oh well. I talked to Lauren today. She is with Will now for sure and things are going really well for them. She's changed a lot, but I think she's got things figured out for herself and we'll see if we stay friends or not. I hope that we do, but who knows. I'm sooo tired! I should go. I love you all. Ciao"

"event","I guess I'm moving to Chicago this weekend. A lot has gone on today. Long story. I have had quite a few offers for modeling in Chicago and some good interviews I hope I'll go to. I think I'm doing a shoot this weekend that hopefully Perfect Wave (surfboard company) will like and accept. This is extremely risky. I'm unsure of what I'm doing. I very well could end up homelessliterally with no money. This will either be the best or the worst decision of my life. I have to quit my job so there's no security or source of income. I will be living with Britt for a while until I find a job and get an apartment. I'm scared shitless. I guess I'm just moving Friday or Saturday. I feel awful that I have to quit Fridays with basically no notice. I wouldn't be able to make this shoot though otherwise. This is absolutely crazy -sigh- Here goes nothing. I need a miracle. Pray for me ha"

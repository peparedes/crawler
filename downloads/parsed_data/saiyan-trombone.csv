"event","So today was pretty busy.  I got up early and went out to Andrew's AFB with mom.  We picked up the copies of my medical records to take to college with me, as well as some perscription refills that were ready at the pharmacy.  I got myself a bike helmet that fits at the BX, and looked at some cell phone plans, seeing as the one that I have won't work where I'm going...  After that, we drove around looking for a K-mart, but to no avail.  On the way back, we stopped by the Ducati dealer so I could finally get a close up look at Il Monstro, the motorcycle that has me obsessed...  The guy at the dealership gave me this nifty fold-out pamphlet that also doubles as a poster... *huggles said poster*

So anyways, we got home, and I crashed, because damn...  that was a lot of running around.  A few hours later, I got a little dressed up and we all went out to the neighbor's brother's restaraunt in downtown DC.  It was THE BEST TEX-MEX I HAVE EVER HAD IN THE DC AREA!   And since we were in with the owner, we got a lot of free food and drinks.  Like my 2 strawberry margaritas ^_^_b  Man, were they tasty.  

Later, my stomach sated with cooked bits of cow, we returned home to chill out in front of the tv.  Which is where I am right now.  All in all, I'd say I had a rather productive day.  Time to hit the hay...  Wait, that rhymed >.<

Peace out, j0!"

"event","Y'know...  I know it's horrible to say, but I'm really glad mom and granny are out of town for a week.  Dad and I get along smashingly when we're not being nagged 24/7.  Yesterday was great.  Slept in while dad was at work.  Took the dog to get him cleaned and de-stinkified.  After dad got home, we picked up the dog and ate a mediocre dinner at Hard Times Cafe.  Since the weather was BEAUTIFUL, we ate outside on the patio.  Talked nerd to each other...  talked movies, motorcylces, cars, etc.  It was thoroughly enjoyable.  Then we drove out to Georgetown, this nifty place on the waterfront in the District.  Walked around, checking out boats, looking at the stores.  Had a chai latte.  Went to Barnes & Noble and marveled at their woefully understocked manga section.  Then we went to see Matrix Reloaded.  I hadn't been looking forward to seeing it, but dad really wanted to, so I wanted to be nice and go with him.  I was impressed.  Really, truly impressed.  It was remarkably better than the first one.  It really made steps towards being a real sci-fi, instead of an overstated action movie with a decent plot.  I could've done without the extended rave scene in Zion.  There were definitely a few extraneous scenes in the movie.  But all in all, I thought it was great...  ^_^;;; Please, no ""I told you so""s...  I still dislike the first one just as much as I did before.  But I give Reloaded a 4 out of 5, definitely ^_^;

Anyways, I gotta get going.  I have episodes of Gravitation to download, and a DDR pad to finish.  I'd like to give a shout out to my new roomie for next semester, Kristi...  ^_^; She's pretty cool.  I think we'll get on okay next semester.  Anyways...

Peace Out, and Blessed Be..."

<h2>You'll Fall in Love With A <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/cancerlover.html"">Cancer</a>!</h2>
You value having the emotional support Cancers bring to relationships.<br>
Cancers are typically very nurturing and have lots of love to give, to everyone.<br>
You are on the lookout for the parent to your future children - and Cancer fits the bill!<br>
<br>
The only downside to your Cancer's incredible love is that they tend to be possessive.<br>
Cancers don't want to spend so much time caring for someone, only to be left later on!<br>
So, they are a your Cancer may be a bit guarded at first and more prone to jealousy.<br>
<br>
Take care of your Cancer's insecurities, and your relationship will be a success.<br>
In return, you'll find the deepest love you've ever known...<br>
As well as the freedom to express your emotions openly, especially during sex.

<h2>You Are A <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/kissquiz.html"">Freaky Kisser</a>!</h2>
From tounge and lip piercings to not so nice biting,<br>
you're a basket full of kissing surprises.<br>
In fact, your kissing syle is so ...<br>
scary that you've been known to send a few dates packing.<br>
No need to worry, somewhere in the world there is a kisser freaker than you!<br><br>
<b>What Your Kissing Style Says About You:</b><br><br>
You live life on the edge, trying everything twice and usually loving it.<br>
Most people are too ""vanilla"" for your tastes - even the ones most consider wild.<br>
Life is all about undiscovered pleasures, and you're up for finding them.<br><br>
<b>Your Personal Kissing Matches and Mismatches:</b>
<br><br>
Find another Freaky Kisser and you'll be pleasantly shocking one another with how far 
you'll go. Kissing while driving a motorcycle at 75mph? No problem! Want to spread your 
freak around? Get together with a Manic Kisser, and you'll be kissing the whole party, 
tag team style.
<br><br>
Warning: Stay away from Intense Kissers. They'll want to get a little 
too deep into the philosophy of kissing, while you're just into it for the fun. And Juicy Kissers are 
no good for you either. They're all about appearances and might have a problem with your lip and tongue piercings.

"event","Well, I arrived home yesterday around 6-ish, but I was too tired to post all about my nifty trip around a nice 4 state area, so now that I've rested up, here goes...

The trip started out Monday morning at around 5 AM.  After getting only 2 hours of sleep, I awoke, took a shower, and was made to drive.  I was also informed that I would be stopping in New Castle, PA, to pick up my nephew Eric, whom I had never met.  He had been adopted out to his father's aunt and uncle, but wanted to see his big brother graduate from high school.  Since he was on the way, our first stop was there to pick him up.  We instantly hit it off, talking about music and cartoons.  It was a nice experience for me, knowing that even after 15 years of not knowing me, he could still treat me with respect and family kinship.

Next stop, around 2pm on monday, we reached Toledo, Ohio.  I had driven this whole way, and was getting just a tad tired.  Besides, I had to acheive my objective for the trip! Play DDR in a new state!  After about 6 times, turning the map and the car around to get going the right direction on the street, we found NickleWorld, home of a rather shoddily-maintained Solo2000 mix.  The interesting thing about NickleWorld was that you pay about 2 dollars to get in, and then everything else runs on nickles....  It was pretty cool, actually.  I played 4 games of DDR for a dollar's worth of nickles.  Add the entry fee and I played 4 games for 3 dollars.  Not bad ^_^  I have to say that I am now NOT a fan of the Solo mixes.  The six-panel setup was awkward for me to grasp.  I think I'll just stick with my trusty left-down-up-right setup for the arrows.

And on to Pontiac, Michigan.  Mom drove the last 1.5 hours from Toledo there.  I drove the 7.5 hours that constituted the rest of the trip...  Anyways, we checked into the Wellesly hotel, which was very nice and homey, with a kitchenette and everything.  Very clean.  After taking the bags to the room, we went to my sister's house for a nice hug-ey reunion.  I got to see my neice Ashley, whom I hadn't seen since she was 10.  She's now 16.  We all decided to go out for a nice dinner, to the Rainforest Cafe at their huge Mills style mall, called Great Lakes Crossing.  What a crazy place.  Animatronic elephants, leopards, butterflies, and birds adorned the rainforest decorated walls.  Once every 10-15 minutes, the ceiling, painted to resemble the night sky, would flash and their sound system would go nuts, emulating a storm.  The waitstaff seemed like they had a good time ^_^.  Afterwards, we went right across the hall to Gameworks, where I played DDR in my second state for the day! The pad was in excellent condition, and I got to pass a song I hadn't ever done before.  I love Extreme.

The next day, Tuesday, was Dondi's graduation.  Earlier in the morning, mom, granny, and I all went over to my sister's again, and visited with my brother-in-law, and the graduate, himself.  Dondi has grown up so much.  He's become a very nice young man, and I was amazed again by how much respect I receive from my nieces and nephews, even though I'm so close to their age.  Between the visiting and the graduation ceremony, I snuk over to Gameworks and played some more DDR and GuitarFreaks, my favorite Bemani game EVER...  Was very fun...  Anyways, the graduation was interesting.  I've never seen so many names on a roster with an apostrophe in them...  L'Quan, D'Quifah, etc...  Afterwards, I partied with my sister and brother-in-law.  Got a little toasty, but I figured I deserved it after all the driving I did the day before.  

The next day, I regretted drinking, because I had to get up early and drive...  We took my nephew back to his adopted parents house, then went to visit an old friend in Beaver Falls, PA.  Pami and I have known each other since we were 10/11 years old.  We've always kept in touch, and this seemed like a great time to hang out.  I got to eat at the Hot Dog Shoppe, home of the best hot dogs and chili-cheese fries EVER...  Oh, how I had missed them...  Then after some visiting and playing around, my old friend Heather made an appearance.  I've known her almost as long as Pami, so it was really neat to be able to visit two long distance friends in one day.  Afterwards, had dinner at Quaker Steak and Lube.  Hottest hot wings I've ever tried...  They left my mouth numb.  Then...  Yeah, you guessed it...  Off to the mall to play some DDR.  ^_^

The next morning, we woke up leisurely, and got all packed and headed home.  Mom drove the whole way...  Making up a bit for all the driving I had done.  All in all, I'd say the trip was pretty fun...  

Today, I got my car emissions tested, picked up my perscription at the pharmacy, and had family night with my folks.  Saw ""The Italian Job""....  Really nifty theif movie, if you ask me...  Dinner at Hunan Treasure afterwards was great.  I had yummy curry that no one stole from me because I'm the only adventurous diner in my family.  I always feel more comfortable eating with chopsticks ^_^

Tomorrow is my dog's 11th birthday.  I have no clue what to do for him.  I guess I'll just try and spend some extra time with him, and maybe give him an extra dog biscuit or something.  ^_^ I love my puppy.  

Well, now that I've made up for all the lost days in my journal, it's time to get going.  I was just talking with my friend Ross, and was somehow inspired to watch Labyrinth ^_^

Blessed Be!"

"event","Well, today was infinitely more productive than yesterday.  I packed for my trip to Michigan to see my nephew graduate.  I located the DDR machines I will be playing on in Ohio and Michigan to add those to my list of states I have played DDR in.  I got an IM from my great grand big brother, who has always helped me out whenever I get confuzzled about something in my life.  He really helped me see things clearer.  And it was the one thing I hadn't thought to do.  Think about what exactly it is that I want, not the possibilities and their probable outcomes.  Well, duh! Why wasn't I thinking of that all along?!  Anyways, afterwards, had hot wings for dinner...  Mom made them just a bit too hot, and I ended up with a headache >.<  Then.....  AAAAAGH!...  I cleaned out my car...  It wasn't AS bad as I thought it would be.  But it was still horrifically messy, nonetheless.  A couple trash bags, a roll of paper towels, and a quarter of a spray bottle of Armor All later, my car is in top form ^_^  All ready for my dad to drive it around while we're away.  I just hope he doesn't look in the secret compartment in the back and find the edible massage creme and bottle of lube........   At least I had the sense to throw away the condoms...  But the massage creme and lube were expensive! I'm not wasting a total of 20 dollars for only using them once, dammit!  AAAAnyways....  Got done with all the chore type stuff and chatted for a while, now I'm writing in my journal ^_^ yay!  Hopefully writing on a daily basis will help me get back my creative spark so I can start writing again.  I'll write while I'm away and post those entries when I get back...  Well, I'd better get to bed so that I can get some sleep for driving when I wake up in 2 hours >.<

"event","So I'm bored...  And it's 2:00 AM...  And I really can't think of anything to do. Lately, everytime I've tried to draw or write anything, nothing comes out the way I want it to.  I feel like my creative impulse has been sucked out of me...  I can't get motivated about anything.  I haven't practiced trombone in over 2 months...  And I'm supposed to be going to school in August under a scholarship to play?!  Oh boy, am I fucked...  I've been trying to get a job for almost 3 weeks now, and not one of the places I've applied to have called me back.  

*SIGH*

It's times like these that make me wanna go buy a pack of cigarettes just so I can smoke ONE.  I think living with my parents after having a taste of living on my own is what's got me so down.  They really helped me out of a tough spot by having me come home for a semester, but I'm honestly ready to get the fuck out of here.  Mom constantly nagging, Granny constantly nagging and irritating the shit out of mom, so that mom takes out all her agressions on me...  Dad...  irritating the shit out of mom, so that mom takes out all her agressions on me...  The only one I'll be REALLY sad to leave is Donny.  I hope I get to where I can support myself pretty quickly, so he can spend at least a year or two with me before he checks out.  I'm a little frightened though.  He's been showing his age more and more lately.  My poor puppy...  *sniffles*

Maybe this is all just normal letdown.  The semster ended.  American Idol ended.  I'm left without the two things I devoted the most thought and energy to during everyday life...  I know it's horrible, and I'm the most anti-reality tv person you could ever meet, but I freely admit it:  I WATCHED EVERY EPISODE OF AMERICAN IDOL!  At first, it was just because that was what was on the tv, and since my parents have supreme tv rights, I couldn't change it.  Then...  I saw Clay Aiken...  And from there, I had to watch, because he is just...  Well, he's AWESOME...  *swoons*...  And it's BULLSHIT that he didn't win...  But I'm not bitter ^_^;;;

I think tomorrow, I'm gonna go get my hair cut.  It's been growing for a while, and it's almost down past my ears.  I can't stand it.  Every day I look in the mirror and think, ""This haircut looks so dumb...  It needs to be short, the way it was...""  Mom insists that it is a wonderful haircut and makes me look more feminine.  *sigh*...  And she bought me a t-shirt cut for girls...  and...  I feel so damn insecure wearing that!  Gimme back my baggy RENT t-shirt!  Let me wear my baggy painter's jeans...  And dammit, as soon as I get a new job, I'm getting my eyebrow re-pierced!  I miss my eyebrow ring...  

Well, I think I've ranted enough.  Goddes, help me to think happier thoughts the next time I post...

Blessed Be, yo....  O_o;"

"event","""Mom,"" Kori called as the three Saiyans walked through the front door.  ""Mom, are you home?""

""Yes,"" came a muffled reply from the kitchen.  ""I figured you'd be home soon.  Lunch is almost ready, so come set the table, honey.""

""Okay!""  Kori made the ""shhh"" motion to Kakkarot to keep quiet.  He winked back at her in acknowledgement.  They had both agreed on the way there that they wanted to surprise her mother with his appearance.  Rolling his eyes, Vegeta strolled past them into the kitchen to take his seat at the table.  Kori peeked around the corner to see that her mother was tending the stove, her back turned towards them.  Motioning to her newfound brother, they both walked silently into the kitchen, Kakkarot standing inconspicuously right behind Sharon.  Kori held back a chuckle as she set the table, making sure to have an extra setting for the tall Saiyan.  

After a few moments, Sharon turned slightly, not seeing Kakkarrot behind her, but noticing the table and the extra place setting.  ""Honey, I think you put too many plates out.  Or is someone else coming for lunch,"" she questioned warily.

""That would be me,"" Kakkarrot spoke from behind her.  ""I hope I'm not intruding.""

Sharon, at first shocked by the voice behind her, turned slowly to see who it was.  She was met with a view of a rather expansive chestplate of Saiyan armor.  Her eyes traveled upwards slowly to take in the face belonging to the chest...  And her knees nearly gave out.  Eyes wide, she spoke shakily, ""You...  You look...  Just like him...""

""Him,"" Kakkarrot blinked questioningly.  ""My father?""

Sharon nodded dumbly.  Tears were already leaking from her eyes freely.  Vegeta turned away, and Kori fought to keep her own tears at bay.  Sniffling slightly, sharon's mouth turned upwards into a smile.  ""You're Kakkarrot.""

He nodded, grinning.  The older woman had barely moved to embrace him before she was swept up into his arms.  Kakkarrot held her tightly, yet gently, his face buried against her shoulder.  ""I never knew...  my mother,"" came the muffled words from the tall Saiyan.  ""Would it be acceptable...  for me to-""

""Of course it would, dear,"" she stopped him, already knowing what he was asking her.  She kissed his forehead gently, hugging him as best she could while she was dangling in his embrace.  After a few lingering moments, he placed her back down again, helping her regain her footing.  Although his face appeared dry, Kakkarrot's eyes were rather misty-looking.  Vegeta cleared his throat, ending a rather awkward pause that had ensued once Sharon was back on her feet.  ""I'd...  I'd better finish lunch before it burns,"" she said, wiping her face on her shirtsleeve.

Lunch passed by quickly, Kakkarrot, Kori, and Sharon all sharing stories and remeniscing.  It almost seemed like they were a family.  However, Vegeta said virtually nothing during the meal, not seeming particularly angry, just like he was pondering something very significant.  

The remainder of the day, like their lunchtime, passed in a blur.  Vegeta had kicked the training up a notch, and was pleased to see Kori rise to the challenge.  They all entered the small home for dinner wearing an assortment of bruises and abraisions, but looking genuinely fulfilled.  After dinner, Kakkarrot settled down on the couch and quickly fell asleep, grateful to be able to stretch out a little after his journey on the ship.  Kori, realizing that tonight was a full moon, quickly retreated to her room and shut the curtains.  Finding herself unable to sleep, she leaned back against the wall, pulling out a book and deciding to read until her eyes felt heavy.

Once Sharon had turned in for the night, Vegeta walked quietly to Kori's room.  Nudging the door open, he spoke quietly so as not to wake anyone.  ""Do you know what happens at the full moon?""

Startled by the sudden intrusion, Kori dropped her book.  She recovered quickly.  ""Not specifically.  I promised my mother never to look at it.  She said horrible things would happen if I did.""

""Not so horrible as you might think, girl.""  Vegeta was silent for a moment, leaning against her doorframe.  He had changed into his Saiyan armor, which was slightly cracked, with a few tears in the spandex-like material underneath.  Kori turned away to hide the blush in her cheeks, her tail flicking about nervously behind her.  ""Come with me,"" he extended his hand to her.  ""I think it is time you learned what that tail is for.""

Blushing more feircely, Kori stood, and followed him without question when he turned and headed for the front door.  She was, of course, afraid, but she trusted him.  He was a Saiyan, so he would know about what was going to happen, right?  At any rate, she at least felt safe around him.  

When they reached the door, he stopped, lowering his voice to a whisper.  ""You must keep your eyes on the ground until I tell you otherwise.  Do not, I repeat, Do not look into the sky at any time.  We will travel by ground, and I will lead you, so all you need do is keep your eyes on the ground.  Do you understand?""

""I understand,"" Kori replied in a hoarse whisper.  Standing straight, she nodded resolutely.

""Good.""  He grasped her wrist, pulling her ouside into the darkness.  She could feel the light of the moon on her.  The air seemed to vibrate with it, making her flesh break out in goosebumps.  It seemed as if the moon was calling to her to look up at it.   

//Just look at the ground, just keep looking at the ground,// She repeated to herself as he began to pull her along quickly.  They traveled for what seemed like a half an hour, but in reality, it had only been about ten minutes.  

A barren field stretched out before them, eerily illuminated in the moonlight.  Coming to a halt, Vegeta let go of her wrist, walking around behind her and grasping her shoulders gently.  ""Now...  Look up at the moon.""

Her shoulders began to shake as she scrunched her eyes shut.  //Should I really be doing this?  What's going to happen?!//  ""I...  I'm...""  //Scared out of my wits,// is what she wanted to say.

""Look,"" he said, his voice more commanding now.  ""Bury your fear now and look.  I will be here.  Nothing will harm you.""  Though nearly growled out, the words were slightly comforting.

Taking a huge breath, and swallowing dryly, Kori forced her eyes open.  Slowly, she tipped her head back and locked her eyes on the full moon.

It was beautiful.  She'd only seen it in pictures and movies before, but that simply couldn't compare to the majesty of seeing that glowing orb hovering overhead.  Her reverie was short-lived, however, as her heart began to beat quickly, thundering hard against her ribcage.  A dull ache began at her tail and spread through her entire body, her breathing reduced to harsh pants.  

""Wha...  What's happening...  to me?!""  Spinning around, she saw Vegeta.  Or what used to be Vegeta.  His face was slowly transforming into something beastly, fangs sprouting from his open mouth, which was slowly becoming a blunted snout.  Fur began growing rapidly wherever she could see skin, and his flame-like hair converted to the dark brown color of the rest of the fur.  He stared back at her with bright red eyes.  Crying out in horror, she lifted her hands to her own face, feeling the same changes happening to herself.  ""What the hell is happening,"" she yelled at him in panic.  Her voice seemed like it had changed, and suddenly the dull pain in her body amplified a hundred times as she began to grow rapidly, her clothes shredding off her as she became much to large to fit into them.

""A transformation,"" Vegeta said, his voice changing now, too, as he began to grow.  It looked as if he was some kind of giant ape.  The armor he was wearing seemed to be able to stretch to accomodate the size of this new form.  He kept speaking, but for some reason Kori's brain had gone foggy.  

As he waited for a reply, Vegeta got the feeling that something was drastically amiss.  Kori was crouched ferally, small snarls and growls the only sounds being emitted from her.  ""Can you hear me,"" he questioned.  She just peered back at him warily.  Moving closer, he reached out to grab her wrist, and was met by a wild attack.  Clawing and roaring angrily at him, she freed herself of his grasp, retreating about 50 yards away from him.  //She can't control her Oozaru form...  It must be her human side that makes it hard for her to realize herself while transformed...//  

Cautiously, he approached her.  Hands extended in a non-threatening gesture, he attempted to connect.  ""Easy...  Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you...""  Her eyes scanned him warily.  ""Try to recognize me...  Vegeta,"" he hoped his name might spark some recognition.  For a moment, her eyes seemed to soften, perhaps remembering who he was.  But that moment was short-lived.  Vegeta was caught off-guard by an energy blast from her mouth as she roared out her fury.

Pulling himself to his feet, Vegeta applied pressure to a rather nasty cut on his arm.  //Dammit, I don't think I'll be able to put up with this until morning...//  Emmiting a growl of his own, he flung himself at her, and after a long scuffle, managed to get the upper hand.  Before she could get away, he quickly ended the fight with a well-placed blow to the neck.  Kori slumped against the ground, slowly returning to her normal form.

Vegeta quickly noticed a rather embarassing problem...  She was naked.  If he could have blushed, he would have.  //Damn, where's a giant ape going to find clothes for a naked girl with a tail at this time of night?!//  There had to be a solution...

//Of course!//  It was right there in front of him.  His gloves had stretched to fit his hands...  //Hopefully they'll stay the same size when removed...//  He had never tried it though.  Carefully, he peeled the glove from his left hand.  It began shrinking slowly, but not at an extremely rapid rate.  Quickly, he picked up the young half-Saiyan and placed her into it up to her shoulders.  It stopped shrinking when it became snug around her.  He let out the closest thing to a sigh of relief that an Oozaru was capable of.  Slowly, and as quietly as possible for a gigantic monkey, he began to carry her home.

As the moon sank below the horizon, Vegeta slowly assumed his normal form.  He had waited a short way from Kori's house, not wanting to risk waking anyone by shaking the earth with his footsteps.  //Hopefully, the girl's mother will still be in bed...//  He did not want another encounter with the vengeful side of that woman...

Making as little noise as possible, he carried Kori into the small house, looking around warily to make sure they were unseen.  Kakkarrot was snoring loudly on the couch, with the dog curled up on the floor next to him.  There was no sign of Sharon.  Vegeta snuk to the back of the house, easing through Kori's half-open door, and laying her down in her bed, pulling the covers over her so that the gigantic glove was out of sight.  He almost chuckled at the sight of her stuck in his over-sized glove.  

A door creaked down the hall, and Vegeta darted quickly back into his own room, making sure to move fast enough not to be seen by human eyes.  Two urges overcame him, as was normal after spending the night as an Oozaru.  The first was to sleep.  the second was to eat...  After a short moment of consideration, he decided that the second could wait, and not long after removing his armor and laying down upon his bed, he fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.

You're most like the prince of all Sayans...Sajin...sa...aww whatever.

Wow, what an arrogant ass! You're a rather large jerk...at least on the outside. You really aren't as evil as you may have once been, but you can still make people feel like crap. Fix that attitude mister, and I'm sure you'll still be adored by the women...probably even more so.

Your anime power is that of super charging. Like Super Saiyans (spelling?) or Tenchi's Jurai power...etc, you can get a rush of adrenaline to make you all the more powerful. You can seemingly do this at will. Enjoy."

"event","Well, last night/this morning was my first time to run the entire paper route.  And to make matters worse, I don't get payed until NEXT monday.  >.< I thought we were supposed to get payed every monday, but I guess that since last week was my first week, they need a week to catch up.  Anyways, when I got to work, my supervisor and I figured out that the sheet they had given me that told me all the turns and stuff was completely wrong, and so we had to sit there until almost 3 o'clock to figure out the right turns and stuff...  So I got a really late start, plus I was completely uncertain about the entire last part of the route...  *sigh*  Anyways, to make a long story short, it took me until almost 9:30 to finish delivering the papers...  I just hope that since I'm starting on time tonight, and I've done the whole route by myself already, that I'll be able to get it done quickly.  I also hope that I'll have enough time to go work out at the gym afterwards...  I'd really like to get some physical activity in.  

Anyways, tomorrow (or today, really) is my first day of classes at UMD.  I really hope I can handle both going to class and having a job and everything...  I really want to make this semester a good one.  Well, I've gotta leave for work in a few minutes, so I'm gonna get going.  Love and Peace!"

"event","Kori and Vegeta spent the flight back to her house in silence.  On Kori's part, it was because she was contemplating just what it was that she would say to her mother when she got home.  //She's got to understand how important it is to me to see my father.  Maybe...  Maybe she'll even want to go, too,// she thought hopefully...

Vegeta was taking the opportunity to wonder what he was going to do for the next 7 to 10 days.  The gravity of this planet was too low for him to get much good out of training alone, and though the girl was willing to fight, she couldn't give him much competition, especially not if he kept beating her to a pulp as he'd done the last two times they had fought.  However, he mused, Saiyans' strength was known to increase after every severe beating they endured, and if he kept pushing the girl like that, there was no telling how fast her strength would increase, and furthermore how strong she would eventually become.

The trip home was much too short for Kori to completely collect her thoughts in preparation for talking to her mother, and as they landed, Vegeta noted a distinct air of purpose about her.  She turned to him, face rather stony, and said, ""I...  I need to talk to my mother.  Alone.  Would you mind occupying yourself elsewhere while I discuss with her what I need to discuss..."" she trailed off, then blinked and quickly added, ""Prince Vegeta,"" as she bowed her head respectfully.

The prince nodded, his respect for her jumping up another notch.  //This battle is hers alone to fight.//  ""Done.""  He reached out, nearly placing his hand on her shoulder in what would have been a reassuring gesture.  But he quickly realized what he was doing, and pulled his hand back, taking to the air without another word.  

Kori sighed softly, watching his form retreat over the forest in the waning sunlight.  She turned, walking almost sullenly into the house, patting her dog lightly on the head as she walked by him.  ""Mom,"" she called out unsteadily.  After recieving no answer, she walked further into the house, towards the kitchen.  ""Mom,"" she said a little louder, seeing her mother in the kitchen, cooking dinner.  

Sharon looked up, a rather harsh look on her face.  ""WHERE have you been?!  I have been WORRIED SICK about you,"" she scolded.  ""You didn't leave a note!  I came home, and both you AND that Vegeta fellow were gone.  And with you in your condition, I should think the LAST thing you'd do is go out somewhere.""  She took a few deep calming breaths, then looked Kori straight in the eye.  ""So...  Are you going to explain to me what's going on,"" she said in an expectant and authoritative tone.

Kori attempted to push the red that always occurred after being berated by her mother back from her cheeks.  She took a few breaths, trying to prepare herself for what she had to say.  ""Mom...  I...""  She swollowed.  ""Last night, we got into dad's lab.  He...  Left a message for any Saiyan that might find the lab.  It contained a star-chart to find his whereabouts, and the blueprints for a ship that could make it there.  We, Vegeta and I, were at Melissa's.  She and her dad work for NASA.  They're going to build the ship.  And in about 10 or so days I'm...""  She paused, steeling herself.  ""I'm leaving with Vegeta.  And Melissa.  We're going to find my father.  I want to find him.  And to help Vegeta save our people.""  Her voice had begun to shake slightly, but nevertheless she remained unshakable.  

Kori's mother stood there with an utterly blank stare on her face.  She closed her eyes for a moment, tears starting to leak silently from behind her eyelids.  When she opened her eyes, they were full of pain and sadness.  And also, understanding.  After a few long moments, she finally nodded.  ""I knew... Some day,"" she sniffed back more tears, ""some day you would leave, and go off looking for your heritage.  I just didn't think it would be so soon...""  She wiped at her eyes, only to have the tears replaced by fresh ones.  ""You can go...  But I...  I can't go with you.  Even though I want to, I can't.  I have the bakery to look after, and a home...  And even though I don't want to admit it, I would be a burden to you.  Melissa is young, and even though she's a human, she'll be able to handle the dangers this trip will throw at her.  But I'm getting old, Kori.  I can't endanger you by coming along and slowing you down.""  She wiped at her eyes, as tears were now flowing freely from them.

Kori didn't know when the tears had started streaming down her own face, but somewhere along the line they had started dripping off her chin onto her shirt, soaking the collar.  She sniffled slightly.  ""Mom...  I'm sorry I have to leave you...""  

Sharon shook her head, trying to clear it.  She laughed sadly.  ""It's okay.  Besides, why are we getting all sad right now anyways?  We've still got ten more days, right?""  She wiped at her tears again, drying her eyes.  ""And it's not like after your adventures you can't come home again.""  She smiled softly.  ""You can always come home,"" she said reassuringly.

Kori smiled back, drying her own eyes.  She nodded.  ""Thank you.""  Kori blinked, looking at the stove.  ""Um, mom, your pot's about to boil over...""

Sharon blinked, a startled expression coming to her face as both she and Kori began working to prevent having dinner become an absolute mess...

***

Vegeta flew back to the house after about an hour, entering through the window of the room they had given him.  It was then that he noticed a repetitive beeping noise in the corner.  //SHIT!  My scouter!//  He cursed himself for not wearing the device or at least keeping it with him.  He picked it up, attaching it hurriedly over his ear and eye and pressing the button on the earpiece to accept an incoming hail.  ""Who is it,"" he asked gruffly.

""Prince Vegeta,"" a familiar voice exclaimed urgently.  ""Where have you been?!  Why haven't you answered our hail?!""

""Save your reprimands for later, Kakkarrot, I'll fill you in once you tell me why you're hailing me,"" the prince replied hastily.

""Sire, it's Vegeta-sei,"" Kakkarrot's voice sounded desparagingly grim.  ""Freiza has begun mobilizing his forces.  Our inside sources tell us that within a standard month's time, he will lead a full-out assault, with the sole purpose of dominating and overthrowing the royal government.  The King already has such a weak hold over the people that upon hearing this, a good part of the general populace rose against him...  He is being held captive in the Palace dungeon, meanwhile, Brolli, Nappa, and I have organized a sort of board of executives to run affairs on Vegeta-sei.  We attempted to hail you, but after your continuous absence from your scouter, I took the liberty of manning your cruiser with a good crew and coming after you.  The people of Vegeta-sei eagerly await your return, my...  My King.""

Vegeta paused, taking this all in and spinning it around in his head for a few moments.  He was king...  Yet he was silently angry for not being able to become king by defeating his father in battle as per his birthright.  

""Sire?""  Kakkarrot brought him back to reality...

""Kakkarrot, I think you would be interested to know that you have a sister,"" Vegeta said in an amused tone.

Kakkarrot sputtered.  ""A what?!""

""Yes, it seems that the rumors were true.  Bardock came here for refuge.  And he settled down with an earthling woman, producing a daughter, half human and half Saiyan.  Shortly after her birth, Freiza's men caught on to where he was, and he fled, leaving behind a lab that no one had opened since his absence until yesterday.  Inside, we found that he had fled to the planet Namek.  He left us blueprints to a ship that will be capable of getting us there.  Construction is already underway on that ship, and we should be leaving to find him in about 6 standard days.""

Kakkarrot chuckled.  ""You move fast, sire.  We will arrive on Earth in just under 2 standard days, and, if you wish, my crew and I will accompany you to Namek, or, return to Vegeta-sei.""

""Kakkarrot, I believe I may need you on this mission, my friend.  I trust that Nappa and Brolli will be able to handle running affairs on Vegeta-sei until we find your father.""  Vegeta knew he could probably do just fine without Kakkarrot, and that the other saiyan might be more useful to him if he returned to Vegeta-sei, but he knew that Kakkarrot wanted to see his father.  He chuckled inwardly, thinking that it would be like looking at a mirror image to see the two of them standing together.

Kakkarrot also knew that the prince...  the King, could fare well without him.  ""Thank you, sire,"" he said in earnest.  ""I will keep you updated, should we receive any news from our informants.  Kakkarrot out.""

Vegeta pulled the scouter from his face, staring at it.  He was the King of Vegeta-sei...  Slowly, a smile spread to his lips.  As soon as it had come, it vanished, however, at the thought that he may very well have become King only to lead the Saiyan race to it's extinction.  //I will not let that happen,// he affirmed to himself.  ""I will find a way..."""

"event","Well, I've been working for a week now.  And I don't hate the job yet ^_^;  So yay!  Anyways, I get my paycheck on monday, though I wish it were sooner, cause I'd really like to go layaway a PS2 and Kingdom Hearts, and sell my dvd player, so that when I get my second paycheck, I can pay it off and have my very own PS2...  I'm also looking forward to getting paychecks because I want to get some anime series and manga books.  I'm going to allot a special part of my budget just for buying anime-related stuff.  Probably like 25 per paycheck or something.  That way I can get all my favorite series by the end of the semester with no problem.  Hmm, let me think...  

 35 a week for gas
+40 a week to start paying my 'rents back
+25 a week anime budget
+25 a week for food and drinks while I'm at college (maybe)
-----------------------------------------------------------
 125 a week...  And my paycheck, depending on whether they take out taxes or not, will probably be around 135-170

So in the end, I'll have between 10 and 45 dollars left over to put into one of those categories to give it a boost...  I was estimating very high on the food and drinks for while at class, just because I never know if I'll need food or anything.  I probably won't but that's just in case.  Anyways, I can probably get a different anime series every 2 weeks!!!  *jumps up and down happily*  This is gonna be awesome!  *hee*  Anyways, I just needed to sit down and write something out so I could refer back to it and mess with it if I wanted to.  

On a lighter note, I downloaded the funniest music video EVER.  It's an AMV of a few different series, but starts and ends with Slayers!, which is one of my fav's.  It's about guys either crossdressing, or guys who look like girls, and it's set to Aerosmith's ""Dude looks like a lady""...  'Nuff said... ^_^;  Funny shit...  Anyways, I'm gonna get going.  Peace!"

"event","Okay, so this morning was IMMENSELY better than yesterday morning.  Work was...  how should I put this...  It was FUCKING COLD out.  And windy.  And the roads were in pretty bad condition, so I had to drive really slow.  Last night I learned to truly appreciate the marvelous technology that is the Anti-lock Brake System.  Nevertheless, I made it through my first night on the route by myself uscathed, and feeling very good about myself that I got everyone's paper to their door even in this shitty weather.  So I arrived home a little before 6, let the dog out, and then Granny woke up, with an offer to cook me whatever I wanted for breakfast.  How could I possibly turn down that offer?!  So I got a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on toast...  It was really good, especially after working all night in the below-freezing cold.  Top breakfast off with cuddling up under 2 blankets and watching a couple episodes of Trigun on the big-screen TV, and I was one happy puppy ^_^  After the second episode of Trigun, I almost passed out on the couch, but managed to make it to bed.  I was awoken around 11:45 by mom, though, and since I was probably about 10% awake when she talked to me, I had to have her repeat herself about 20 times before I could comprehend what she was trying to tell me.  I had a dental appointment at 1:00 that I had forgotten about.  Good thing she remembered.  Anyways, after much blinking and yawning, and attempting to get out of bed, I finally got a shower and went to the dentist's.  It was probably the best dentist's appointment I've ever had O_o;;;  It went really fast, and was relatively painless, and the doctor was very sociable and nice.  I left the office feeling good about my ump-teenth visit to the dentist with no cavities, and also feeling pretty awake.  I know I should probably go back to sleep, cause I only got about 4 hours worth, but I'm just so awake...  Anyways, that's all that's happened in my day so far, so if anything else comes up, I'll just update.  Peace out!"

"event","*sigh*...  This morning sucked.  I mean, my job is cool, and I really like it.  But when you work all night and get home, the last thing you want is for someone to ask you if you're going to practice your trombone at like 7 in the morning.  Which is exactly what my mom did.  Then she got majorly pissed off at me because I told her the truth; It's hard to pick up the instrument after I've had so much downtime.  It's hard to be motivated about it.  It's hard for me to feel motivated about ANYTHING at freaking 7 AM when I've just worked all night.  And if it's not bad enough, she was also pissed off about my dad, who is never fun to deal with in the morning.  But who does she yell and curse at about it?  Not him...  She's also pissed off about people not paying her back for things that they owe her for.  Does she yell and curse at them?  Nope...  This morning, I was a fucking scapegoat.  She pretty much took out all her agression on me.  Then I broke down and cried, because, shit, it was 7 in the morning, I'd just worked all night, and all I wanted to do was eat some leftover mac and cheese and go to bed.  Dad tried to comfort me before he left for work, but he's miserable at that kind of stuff, especially in the morning.  So I was trying to get to my room so I could eat in peace, and I passed mom, with tears still on my face.  And do you know what she did then?  She yelled even more, telling me she didn't care what the fuck I did, and she was tired of dealing with all my shit and dad's shit and other people's shit.  Then she stormed out the door.  I ate my mac and cheese and watched about the first 10 minutes of the Escaflowne movie before passing out.  When she got home, she tried to make me feel better, tried to explain to me how she was justified in taking out all her agressions on me.  I just hope I don't end up like that.  I don't want to take out all my agressions on one person.  I don't want anyone to have to feel like I feel today, or like I feel on the other days that mom does this to me.  I'm glad I came home, really.  I guess this is just the kind of thing I'm going to have to deal with.  A price I have to pay for all the benefits of living at home with my family.  

*sighs, swallowing around the lump in her throat*

I think I'm gonna take another short nap before I get up and get ready for work.  I get to run like 2/3 of the route by myself today.  That's pretty cool, I think.  And the great thing is, I can turn up my music as loud as I want.  I need to get a headset for my cell phone so that I can talk to Corey while I do my paper route.  That would be great...  Anyways, I'm gonna go lay down.  Hopefully I'll be in better spirits when I next post.  Peace."

First, you have to be completely naked in front of someone that you don't know, and then, you have to let them touch you in all the places where you're told it's ""bad"" for strangers to touch you.  With weird equipment, no less.  Yeah, that's what the Subject is about.  Speculum...  That word just sounds kinda scary...  Anyways, the doctor was actually really nice about everything.  She talked me through everything, kinda calmed my nerves down a bit.  The great thing is that everything was very normal, and she said I was in very good condition ^_^;  Then we got to the fun part...  Talking about the various methods of Birth Control...  So now I'm on ""THE PILL"" as you would say...  Well, not on it yet, because it has like a cycle you have to go through, and you have to start taking them on a certain day.  But anyways, I just needed to write it down, kinda get it out of my system before I go pass out from exhaustion.  This paper route is going to kill me...  ^_^; So anyways, it's off to bed!

"event","The lift doors barely had time to open before Kori bolted out, leading Vegeta to the kitchen.  She realized that she hadn't eaten in almost a full day, and with her wounds trying to heal, she was more famished than she could ever remember being in her life.  Her tail flicked out anxiously behind her at the prospect of a good meal.  As she and the Prince reached the kitchen, she quickly called for one of the serving droids and, after pressing a few of the buttons on its chest display hurriedly, it whizzed off to get their food.  She turned to Vegeta, saying, ""It'll only be a few minutes, the droids are fairly quick about fixing the food...""

Vegeta simply nodded in response, crossing his arms over his chest and leaning against the nearby counter nonchalantly.  After a few moments 2 voices, one male and one female could be heard approaching, though neither of them were familiar to Vegeta's acute hearing.  Kori seemed slightly unnerved though and she quickly hid her tail beneath her shirt, turning to face the entryway of the kitchen.  She motioned for him to do the same, but he just snorted.  The Prince of the Saiyan race would NOT hide his tail as if it were something to be ashamed of.  He did, however, wrap it discreetly around his waist, having it look like a rather thick, furry belt.  As the voices drew nearer, he noticed the half-Saiyan taking calming breaths, and he wondered idly why she would be so nervous...

The pair that entered the room were deeply engrossed in conversation, though it must have been a pleasant one, because they were both smiling lightly.  The man was a good height, taller than Vegeta by about 3 or 4 inches, and he had a full head of neatly combed brown hair...  or was it deep purple?  He could see a definite resemblance between his and Melissa's faces, thus deducing that they were related, and most likely brother and sister.  The girl that was with him was thin, with a mass of blonde curls sprouting from her head that hung just to her chin.  She was also scantily clad, moreso than he had seen any of the other women on this planet so far.  It seemed that by wearing so little clothing she was trying to draw attention to her rather massive busom or to her curved posterior.  Or both.  Either way, Vegeta didn't care much for the garments...  or lack thereof...  

He didn't have long to observe the newcomers because the male looked up from his conversation, and upon seeing Kori in the corner, broke into a nervous smile.  ""H-hey there, Kori,"" he grinned a little wider.  ""What are you doing here? And who's your friend,"" he asked, gesturing to Vegeta as his female friend slipped off, most likely to the restroom.

""I was just...  visiting Melissa...  And this is Pr- er...  Vegeta.  Vegeta, this is Mark, Melissa's brother...""  She gave Vegeta an almost apologetic look for not introducing him properly.  

Mark stuck out his hand, plastering a huge grin across his face. ""Nice to meet you.""  Vegeta, sensing that something was not quite right about Mark, simply inclined his head towards him, leaving his hand hovering in midair.  The grin faded from Mark's face.  Mark turned to Kori.  ""Hey, he's not your boyfriend is he,"" he asked softly.  Kori blushed, but before she could say anything, he misinterpreted the blush to mean ""yes"".  ""He's not mad because I kissed you, is he,"" Mark winked at her.  Kori blushed an even brighter shade of red, and stood there sputtering, not able to get any words out.  Suddenly, Mark's eyes darkened as he looked over Kori's bruised face, noting the slash over her eye.  He pulled her to the side of the kitchen, whispering urgently, ""He hasn't been beating on you, has he....?  Is that why you can't say anything?""

Vegeta, who of course had heard everything Mark said, was quickly starting to lose his patience with the way he was treating Kori.  First, the man had apparrently assumed that he and the half-Saiyan were involved romantically.  //Preposterous,// Vegeta snorted.  Now this idiot had the nerve to ask if he was using physical force to keep a woman silent about a relationship that they weren't even in!!!  This thought forced a soft growl from Vegeta's throat.

Kori, whose face was contorted in anger, had been readying a retort, when a low rumbling sound came from Vegeta's direction.  Kori and Mark simultaneously blinked, looking over at him.  Mark, slightly unnerved, coughed nervously and asked, ""D-did...  you just...  growl?""

Vegeta smirked, eyes narrowing like an animal on the hunt.  ""Yes,"" he stated simply.  ""Your idiocy is exhausting.""  Mark's eyes widened.  Vegeta took a step forward.  Mark took a hesitant step back.  ""You assume much for how little information you actually have.  We sparred, that is how she obtained her injuries.  She willingly subjected herself to anything that happened to her.""

Mark was starting to get a little ancy.  If Kori could beat him easily, and this is what happened to her after simply sparring with this ""Vegeta"", he didn't even want to think about what would happen if he antagonized the guy any further.  ""E-easy man, I was just concerned about Kori...""

Vegeta took another step closer. ""She does not require the concern of a weakling such as you,"" he spat.  ""She is strong enough to handle her injuries.""  Kori watched all this happen in a half daze.  On one hand she didn't want any harm to come to Mark, but on the other, she hoped that Vegeta could shut him the hell up.

Mark stepped back again, this time his back came into contact with the wall, and he realized he didn't have anywhere to go.  His face blanched as he stuttered nervously, ""L-look, I d-don't want to fight about this...""

Vegeta stalked forward again.  ""No, you don't,"" he affirmed, his smirk becoming more feral.  

Mark, who was actually starting to fear for his life, groped back behind himself, finding a rather imposing kitchen knife, and readying himself, should Vegeta attack him for some reason.  Kori saw Mark grab the knife and started to warn Vegeta, but he had caught the slight movement, seeing a glint of metal near Mark's side.  In a flash, the knife was not in Mark's hand, but Vegeta's, and Mark was being held forcibly up against the wall by his throat by something that wasn't one of Vegeta's hands.  He really couldn't wonder what it was at that moment though, because of the sheer fact that he was choking.

Kori, stunned, rushed up to Vegeta, but the look in his eyes made her wonder whether she should try to stop him or not...

Vegeta growled menacingly, whatever it was holding Mark's throat drawing tighter.  ""What did you think you were going to do with this, boy,"" he held up the knife.  ""You're pathetic!""

Kori couldn't stand it any longer.  ""Vegeta, drop him,"" she yelled.  

""Why? He insulted my honor,"" he growled.  ""For that he deserves to die.""

Kori's eyes widened.  She had to think of a logical way to get him to drop Mark, and FAST...  ""He's Dr. Griffey's son!  If you kill him, Dr. Griffey won't build the ship!""

Vegeta growled louder, knowing she was right.  He shot the red-faced, strangling Mark a look that could burn through steel, and unceremoniously dropped him on his rump.  Vegeta's tail, which had been holding him up by the neck, flicked out behind him in an expression of his pent up agression.  Vegeta threw the knife to the ground at his side.  ""Here's your weapon, for all the good it will do you...""

Mark coughed, rubbing at his throat and panting for air.  Once he caught sight of Vegeta's tail, however, his face bleached white and, after blinking a few times, he quickly scrambled from the room, still half-ways on his hands and knees.  Vegeta snorted derisively at him as Kori wiped the sweat from her brow.  //That was close,// she thought.  She had to figure out a way to curb the violent Prince's temper somehow, before he killed someone for looking at him wrong...

Suddenly the curly-haired blonde Mark had walked in returned from the restroom.  Noting the look on both Kori and Vegeta's faces, she simply turned and walked out of the room, looking for Mark.  About 10 droids arrived after another minute, bearing a wide selection of foods, and the two hungry Saiyans dispensed formalities and started devouring the food, forgetting the tense situation that had happened only minutes before.

Melissa walked in, looking for them.  ""Hey, Mark's acting funny, someone must've scared the shit out of....""  Melissa stopped as she observed the two stuffing food into their mouths, much in the manner of ravenous wolves.

Kori stopped long enough to shrug and say, through the food in her mouth, ""Wasn't me...""

Vegeta let out the closest thing to a laugh she'd heard him produce in the short time she'd known him.  His tail swished proudly behind him, and she could swear he almost grinned...

Melissa chuckled.  ""Good.  He needs to be set straight...""  She contemplated snagging a sandwich, but thought better of it, seeing as how she might get her hand bitten off...  ""Anyways, I came up here to tell you that my dad and I can build the ship, but it's going to take about a 10 days, maybe a week if we don't sleep.""  She waited for a reaction.

Vegeta wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.  He nodded to her in approval, for he had actually expected it to take much longer.  ""Good.  As the Prince of the Saiyan race, I will, of course recompensate you and your father for your services.  Simply set a price and I will match it, to the best of my ability.""

Melissa didn't even blink.  ""Let me come with you.  That's all the payment I require.""

Vegeta's eyes nearly came out of his head.  He sputtered loudly, nearly growling.  Letting a mere human accompany them would severely impede their mobility, speed, and ability to defend themselves in battle.  He silently berated himself for offering to pay any price within his ability, for he knew that this was well within that range.  After a long inner debate, he finally conceded.  ""Fine,"" he said gruffly.  ""You may come with us.  But you must see to it that you are able to handle yourself in the environment we are traveling to.  I will not let you become a burden to my mission.""

Melissa nodded excitedly.  ""Don't worry, I can take care of myself better than you think...""

Somehow Vegeta doubted that.  Kori grinned, nearly picking Melissa up in a hug.  ""This is great,"" she said excitedly.  ""I was kind of hoping to have some companionship...""

Melissa just winked as Kori let her out of the embrace.  ""Yeah, I've always wanted to go out there on one of the ships dad and I have made.  It's kind of been my dream.""  She grinned.  ""Well, I better not waste any time, I'm gonna go get to work.  You guys can stay if you want,"" but Kori cut her off.

""I'd better get home and talk to mom about all this.  I don't know how happy she'll be that I'm leaving the planet in a little over a week,"" Kori said nervously.

""Right.  Well, I'll give you a call tonight and update you on our progress, okay?""

""Okay,"" she said, hugging her friend again.  ""Bye!""

""Bye,"" said Melissa, walking back to the lift to go down to the lab.

Kori turned to Vegeta.  ""We'd better go.""  Vegeta nodded, heading for the door.  Luckily, they did not encounter Mark on the way.  Once they were outside, Vegeta moved to pick her up again.  Kori blushed deep red, backing up, ""N-no, it's okay.  I...  Think I can fly on my own this time...""  Vegeta nodded, and almost smiled...  Almost.  Then they quickly took to the air, heading back to Kori's house.

"event","Okay, so for some reason, my body decided it would be a good idea to sleep until 3:00 pm today O_o;;;  It was probably just because I had a really long day yesterday, but for goodness sakes! I slept for 13 freaking hours!!!  Well, mom didn't seem too upset when I woke up, I guess she figured I needed my rest or something.  So I got up, and took a shower, and then dad came home and we all decided to go to the movies to see ""A Guy Thing"".  Good movie ^_^  Jason Lee humor (and yeah, okay, so I think he's a hottie), and I really like Julia Stiles, she's really funny and sarcastic and stuff ^_^  And then, since I hadn't eaten, we went to Bob Evans, and for the second night in a row I had breakfast for dinner.  But Bob Evans makes breakfast a little better than my mom. SHHHH! Don't tell her!!!  So now I'm just chilling out, doing nothing.  Well, if I think of something to say later, I'll post again...  Till next time, [i]Ciao!"

"event","*yawns* Geez, I had a busy day today...  Mom woke me up at like 7 so I could go with her to get my car registered and get the liscense plates and crap.  We ended up not leaving until like 9 cause dad misplaced the insurance cards and we had to have him fax them to us from his work.  Next we came home, got Granny and the dog, and took Donny to get groomed.  Then we ate lunch at Hunan Treasure, where I once again wowed my family with my ability to eat rice with chopsticks.  We had some time to spare afterwards, so I went over to the anime/video game store in the plaza while mom and granny went to starbucks to read (take a nap in the comfy chairs).  I had to curse my luck, though, because the manga that I've been waiting to read the 4th issue of had just sold out the previous day...  Anyways, after bumming around the store a bit, mom, Granny, and I all got our hair cut.  Afterwards, I realized I still had upwards of $20 on an Old Navy card, so we went over there and I got a zip-up hooded sweatshirt that's almost 2 sizes to big, so I could bum around the house in it.  We called to see if Donny was done being groomed yet, and they said to check back in an hour and a half, so we took a ride over to Border's, so I could use my other giftcard.  They had also run out of the 4th issue of Paradise Kiss, so instead, I got the first issue of Love Hina, and a neat little Slayers! graphic novel that looks like it'll be a lot of fun.  Finally we were able to retrieve my freshly groomed and bandanna'd retriever and return home.  Mom needed some help then, ordering large print books for herself and my grandmother online, but as a reward for helping her find them, she bought me the 2 books I needed to complete my Wolfwalker collection, so I'd say it was a fair trade.  After that, Granny and I sat down and watched my Escaflowne dvd.  Dad brought home some mediocre pizza, that we ate as the movie ended, and now I'm downstairs, escaping the family squabbles I know will eventually occur from having my mother, father, and grandmother in the same room together.  All in all, I'd say it was a pretty productive day.  Well, I feel a little sleepy, so I think I'm gonna hit the hay.  G'night, journal.... *passes out*"

"event","As they landed on the front lawn of the Griffey residence, Kori stepped quickly out of Vegeta's arms and onto her own two feet, blushing slightly.  Though she wasn't sure whether she was blushing out of embarassment from having to be carried, or because of being in such close proximity to the Saiyan Prince.  The blush did not go unnoticed, and the prince smirked quietly to himself.  //Flustered, little halfling,// he wanted to ask.  He quickly shook his head to clear it.  He had better things to do that vy for the affections of a weak half-breed.  //A weak half-breed that could very well help save the entire Saiyan race from extinction,// he reminded himself.  //And who knows? With the correct training, she could hold her own with even the toughest of warriors.//  His thoughts were cut short as a shorter human girl ran out of the gigantic house towards Kori.

""Kori, you're here!  What took so lo-"" she stopped short, seeing the bruises across Kori's face and arms, and the slash that marred her face.  ""My god, what happened?!""

Kori quickly held her hands up in an ""it's okay"" gesture. She took a breath, trying to figure out how to phrase it...  ""Um, well...""  She looked over to Vegeta.  ""Ve- I mean, Prince Vegeta and I...  sparred...""

Melissa looked over Kori, then looked over Vegeta, then back to Kori.  ""Jesus, if that's what he did to you sparring, I'd hate to think what would've happened if he actually fought you!""  She looked over Kori again, stepping closer.  ""Are you...  okay?""

Kori chuckled, smiling.  ""I'm fine.  Just a little bumped up.  Nothing I can't handle.""

Vegeta smirked inwardly, approving.  //She wears her battle scars proudly.  As a Saiyan should.//  He grimaced.  //Since when did I become so preoccupied with her behaviors?!//  He berated himself as the girls went over the past days happenings quickly.  He examined the other girl as she and Kori talked.  She was short, not as much so as Kori's mother, but visibly shorter than Kori.  Her hair was long, and tied back from her face with a band.  As he looked harder at her dark brown hair, he began to realize that it was really a deep shade of...  purple?  //These earthlings have interesting hair colorings,// he mused.  Though she did not look very strong, she was actually rather pretty.  As the girls' conversation waned into unimportant matters, he cleared his throat, reminding Kori of the reason they were really there.

""Okay,"" Melissa started, ""Let's go find dad.  He's probably tinkering in his lab...""  Melissa started leading them into the house, Kori following, and Vegeta bringing up the rear.

***

As they stepped off the lift in the basement of the mansion, Kori's eyes were greeted by what was probably the most comprehensive, technologically advanced, and...  messy... laboratory that she'd ever seen.  In fact, it was about the size of a small airplane hangar.  Computer screens lined the walls, little lights flickering and flashing everywhere, machines ticking, buzzing, and cranking away busily.  Designs cluttered the tables and desks, and most of the chairs around.  The technology was such that she'd never seen, even in some of her books.  Her long lost father's small lab paled in comparison.  She whistled low in awe and admiration.  ""Geez, Lyssa, you and your dad sure have a lot of...  um...  stuff,"" she chuckled.  Melissa just laughed in agreement.

Vegeta, though he gazed scrutinizingly at the clutter, nodded approvingly.  If there was anywhere on this planet that could build the craft they needed to get to that backwater planet Bardock had fled to, this was the place.  Vegeta stiffened warily as a pile of junk in a nearby corner began to stir.

""C-could someone give me a hand,"" said the pile.

Vegeta blinked.  Kori stifled a chuckle.  Melissa just rolled her eyes.  ""Dad, how did you get stuck in there?""

""That doesn't matter right now, honey.  The important thing is that I get out...""  The pile of junk shifted a bit, and the man grunted softly.

After Melissa and Kori shared a chuckle at Vegeta's utterly confused expression, the three of them moved quickly over to move pieces and parts of machinery off the pile.  Soon, a short, gray-haired, slightly balding man with thick silver framed glasses and a wiry moustache emerged.  He rubbed gingerly at his elbow, then sighed.  ""Thanks, kids.  I really need to do something about this place.  It's getting where I can only find things when they fall on me.""  He and the two girls laughed together.

Though Vegeta winced at the ""kids"" comment, he waited politely to be introduced, rather than scare the man off by demanding that he build his spaceship.  He didn't have to wait long, though, as Melissa quickly ceased her laughing and got down to business.  ""Daddy, um, Kori's dad was an alien from another planet, and they need to find him.  This is the Prince of that planet, Prince Vegeta, and they need you to take a look at a ship design to see if you can build it so they can go find her father.""

Kori's mouth hung open, staring at Melissa in shock at how casually she had said that all to her father.  //What the hell are you doing?!//  She tried to calm herself, hoping he'd take the information without freaking out or worse.

Vegeta didn't show any emotion but to blink.  Inwardly, he saluted the girl's straightforwardness, but questioned how well her father would take such a huge shock to his system.

Dr. Griffey blinked, and seemed to be mulling things over in his head for a few seconds.  Then he smiled.  ""Well,"" he said, turning to Kori, ""I always knew something was strange about you.  All that strength, and you supernatural speed...  And the tail...""  Kori blushed.  ""I know you tried to hide it, but I'm not quite so addlebrained as you think.  So, this ship.  You need it solely to find your father?  Or does finding her father,"" he turned to Vegeta, ""serve some higher purpose?""

Vegeta nodded honestly.  ""Our race, the Saiyans, have slowly been enslaved by a tyrant, Freeza.  We fear war with him, but her father, Bardock, may have the key to turning the tide in our favor.  I mean to seek him out and ask for him to rejoin his people, to help us free ourselves from Freeza's rule.""

""And why should I envolve Earth in your war?  What danger would I be putting the people of this planet in if I agree to help you?""

Vegeta thought for a moment.  ""You would put Earth in more danger by making my stay longer than by facilitating my leave.  The longer I am here, the more chance Freeza has to come and find me.""  He paused.  ""And would you deny a race their freedom?  Would you deny her a father?""  He gestured to Kori, waiting for the older man to respond.

Kori's heart beat hard against her chest.  It was all she could do to keep her mouth shut as she silently pleaded with her eyes for him to help.  She wanted, more than anything, to meet her father.  To know what her people were like.  To belong...

Dr. Griffey, after a long moment, nodded tersely.  ""You have me there.  Very well, I will build the ship.""  He couldn't have said much else, because Kori hugged him tightly, lifting him slightly off the ground.  Vegeta shook his head disapprovingly.  He would have to break her of that habit before reaching Vegeta-sei.  He stopped.  Was he already thinking of taking her to Vegeta-sei with him?  

""Thank you, sir!  I promise, I'll help as much as I can.  As much as you'll let me...""  She set him down, letting him out of the hug.

Dr. Griffey readjusted his glasses, catching his breath and chuckling.  ""Well, give me the design and let's see what we've got...""  Vegeta handed him the small disk/chip that held the design and they walked over to a computer to view it.  Melissa grabbed Kori's elbow and pulled her out of hearing range of the other two.

""Why didn't you tell me he was a total hottie,"" Melissa whispered excitedly.

Kori rolled her eyes, even though she blushed slightly.  ""Is that all you think of?!""

""Oh come on, you can't possibly tell me that he's not hot...""

Kori sighed...  ""Fine, yes, he is, but he's a Prince!  I'm just...  A half-breed.  I'm probably lower than pond-scum to him...""

""Oh Bullshit!  I've never seen anyone look at 'pond-scum' the way he looks at you.""

Kori blushed bright red.  She hadn't really noticed him looking at her at all.  ""I don't know Melissa.  I'm just glad he doesn't want to kill me.  Between you and me, I think if he wanted to, he could probably kill everyone on the planet.  It's kind of scary...""

Melissa shivered.  ""Shh.  Don't talk like that.""

""Melissa,"" Dr. Griffey shouted excitedly, ""Come and look at this!""

The two girls hurried over to the screen where Dr. Griffey was displaying the ship design.  Most of it was greek to Kori, but Melissa understood it perfectly.  ""Wow! That's the most advanced design I've ever seen!""

""It's the most advanced design I'VE ever seen,"" said Dr. Griffey.  ""Which is really saying something.  I've never seen a drive system like this before.  I wonder if this is your father's own design, Kori...""

Kori stared at the two in awe and maybe even a little jealousy.  She wished she could share something like that with her own father.  A low, loud rumble from behind her jerked her from her reverie.  She turned to see Vegeta, who was trying to look inconspicuous, but just as she was about to turn back around, the rumble started again, and she pinpointed the location of the sound with a chuckle.  ""Hungry,"" she asked him.  He simply nodded.  Her own stomach tugged at her consciousness as well.  ""Hey Melissa, d'you mind if we go get some food from the kitchen?""

""Go ahead, we're stocked up,"" she said, chuckling.  ""Dad and I are gonna go over this a bit more, I'll be up in a few minutes, okay?""

But Kori and Vegeta were already in the lift, getting ready to go up.  ""Okay,"" Kori shouted back as the door shut.  Melissa chuckled as the lift ascended to the main floor."

"event","Well, well...  I've got a journal I didn't remember I had.  And a good thing, too, because I like the reliability of LiveJournal as opposed to the touch-and-go feel you get with um, that other one where I have a journal under the same sn...  hehe... *ahem* Anyways, I think it's time I got reacquainted with my journal, and with anyone that might read this in the near or distant future.  And since I'm feeling humorous and reminiscent of my upbringing, I'll do this in a way that may be a little unfamiliar to some people...

Bless me journal, for I have lived.

It has been one year and five days since my last entry.  Over that time I've changed quite a bit from the green young college sophomore I was after that bowl game.  I was headed off then, to my first apartment living experience, with a man that wanted more to do with me than I with him.  I assumed that we would be roommates and good friends, where he assumed that my affection for him would grow into something further and we would pursue a romantic relationship.  Though he and I are still good enough friends, we ceased living together after that first semester.  Sometimes I think it would have been better if we had weathered that storm and kept living together.  The semester to come has probably been the low point of my life.  Not only did I take on more financial burden than I could chew with 2 new roommates that really didn't have any financial stability to speak of, but I also shirked my own financial responsibilities enough to cut so close to the edge that once I fell over there was no way out but to pull completely out of Texas Tech, and Lubbock, and retreat home.  Which is where I am right now.  College Park, MD.  Luckily, over this trying semester I managed to actually do a better job of going to class and doing my assignments than I had in the past year, so transferring into the University of Maryland was absolutely no problem to me.  Over this past semester, I've been stressed financially, emotionally, and physically, but there has been one thing...  one saving grace...  that has kept my spirits lifted enough for me to pull myself up near the end of my trials.  I met him through a coincidence(?) online, and after speaking regularly to each other online and over the phone for a couple months he drove down with a friend, near the end of my summer semester, and we met.  I could start into a flowered soliloqy about how, when I saw him for the first time as we stepped out of our cars, the heavens parted and the angels sang and rays of hope burst into my dreary life for the first time in ages.  But that wouldn't do it justice.  It's as simple and as complex and as mind-numbingly wonderful as I never imagined it could be.  We are the same.  We even have the same name.  Even though the spellings differ for the genders, the pronunciation remains the same.  But that doesn't matter.  We are the same.  And we are different.  The same to bind us together, and different enough to make every moment interesting and new and yet somehow, familiar.  We have a wonderful relationship, especially for having to spend so much time away from each other.  Having him there for me, even though he was 800 miles away, helped me through even the toughest days, when I thought I couldn't possibly make it through.  Corey, if you're reading this, I love you.

And somehow, I made it home, over hill and dale, mountain and valley, towing a uhaul behind a tiny little Honda CR-V.  What will happen now?  I'll go to U of M, take a couple of my core curriculum courses, and hopefully, if the price is right, be able to start up at Arkansas State University in the Fall (which, if you haven't figured it out yet, is where Corey is).

So do I say 4 Hail Mary's and 3 Our Father's?

No.

Instead I think I'll write a poem.

Help me find the strength
I once thought I had
So I can make it through this.

Help me find the way
To the path that once was clear
So I can make it through this.

Help me see the light, for
My sadness has blinded me.
I need to make it through this.

Stay here by my side, and
If you'll just hold my hand,
I know I can make it through this.


One good poem deserves another...

Well, I may not be so pretty
And I know that I'm not thin,
But my coversation's witty
and I'll always bring a grin.
My hair's short, like a tomboy,
My attire always plain.
But I always enjoy
life, it's never been mundane.
And oh, I've got a man that loves me,
Just the way I am.
So I'll take what I've got happily,
and the rest of you little cheerleader barbie girls can go suck spam.....








Bet you didn't see that one coming ^_^_V

Well, I'm sleepy, finally, so...  I'm out! Peace..."

Well, I'm finally back in good ol'e Lubbock, TX...  I'm actually kind of happy to be back.  The trip back was nice.  I ended up in San Antonio last wednesday, and spent the night on base.  The next day, I drove up to Copperas Cove to visit my big brother and his family.  I had a really good time with him.  Since he's out of school right now, and his wife was at work and his kids were at daycare, we got to spend a lot of time together, just the two of us.  We went shopping for a dsl/cable router, and went to see Lord of the Rings.  I also cooked for him.  That was pretty cool.  Then I drove back up to Lubbock.  Anthony and I just hung out a lot, and 2 days ago, we drove up to Ruidoso to go snowboarding.  We'd never done it before, so we spent most of our time on our asses.  I'm still kind of sore.  It's the first day of classes now, and I'm enjoying my nice lazy MWF schedule.  Pretty much all of my classes are on TR.  My week is kinda shaped like a mountain.  I stay at school later and later till wednesday, and then earlier until friday.  I'm kinda running out of stuff to talk about, so I'll get going.  I'll probably start updating every day now.  Till next time!

Peace out-

Well, a lot of stuff has happened since my last entry.  I went to the bowl game in San Antonio...  Let's recount that trip, shall we?  I got dropped off at BWI airport a little more than 3 hours prior to my flight.  I didn't have my tickets, because I had forgotten to check my jacket pocket in Lubbock, and left them in Anthony's car.  He sent them to me about a week to late, and I don't think they're going to get here even by the time I go back to Texas for the semester.  Consequently, I had to buy a 1 way ticket to get to SA, and I'm still feeling slightly sick at having that charge on my credit card.  But once I get the real ticket, I can just take it to Southwest airlines and get a refund for my 2 one way tickets that I had to buy to get from here to San Antonio and back.  Ok, so I made it to San Antonio alright.  I had a slight problem, though...  My trombone was in my car in Schertz.  So I called the person whose house I left my car at.  She couldn't help me.  Then I called my dear old friend John...  I now realize that sometimes the people you think you can count on just totally dick you in the end.  John agreed to help me, so he got on the road.  Then about ten minutes later, he called and told me ""I can't make it cause the Spurs are playing and traffic is really bad.  If I don't turn around I won't make it to Chris's on time to watch South Park.""  F**king SOUTH PARK!  What a jerk.  So I called Mr. Griffey, who is a saint here on earth, and he agreed to go get my horn and bring it to me.  He's such a nice man.  I owe him my firstborn :-P.  Well, inevitably when one problem gets solved, another one arises, so a few of my acquaintances were in the room, and asked me to go to dinner with them.  I was surprised, of course, because usually I'm not invited to stuff like that.  So I agreed, and just wanted to change my shirt.  I had just finished changing when they yelled to hurry up.  When I ran down the hall, they were nowhere in sight.  I took the elevator down to the ground floor, and I still couldn't find them.  I walked all over the hotel and still couldn't find them.  I'm kinda used to getting ditched, but that doesn't make it hurt any less.  I decided to just make the best out of my solitude and have a quiet night to myself.  I went to taco bell and got an outrageous amount of food, came back to the room, and ordered Swordfish off the movie thing.  It was actually kind of nice.  Afterwards I passed out on the bed and didn't have to get up until the middle of the day the next day.  That night I had a riverboat Battle of the Bands thing with Court Jesters.  That was a blast!  Afterward, Jason and his new roommate and I went to see Kate and Leopold.  That was a really good movie...  Funny, Romantic, a little Sci-Fi, and serious eye candy (HUGH JACKMAN!!!)...  Anyways, the next morning, it was a nice early practice, then about a 3 hour nap, and then a full band pep rally out in Alamo Plaza (that was pretty cool).  Later that night was a band one gig over at Sunset Station.  Afterwards, a bunch of us got together to go watch Ron Wilkens play at The Landing on the riverwalk.  The next day I slept in as long as I could, then jumped into my uniform and went over to play at the game.  Pregame went pretty well, it was kinda cool to see when we hit all the big sets, every time we hit one, there were about a million flashes with the cameras.  I think they took more pictures of the band than of the football game.  Halftime was great!  Our crowd response was awesome.  We really just kicked the pants of the Iwa band (the spelling error was intentional, nobody from Iowa realizes that their state has 3 syllables- I-O-WA.  To them, it's pronounced I-WA...  anyways), there was really no contest...  After the game, I was getting ready to hit the hay, when Jordan called (and it's a good thing, too, cause I had no idea when he was gonna show up to take me to the airport.)  We ended up going to see a movie...  guess which one...  Yep, it was Kate and Leopold again!  Anyways, the next morning, I got up, Jordan took me to the airport, I bought another one way ticket so I could get home, and had a nice sleepy plane trip.  When I got in, mom, granny, and I went to Arundel Mills mall, and I had a nice Crabcake sandwich for dinner (mmmmmmmm....), then we went to see a movie...  KATE AND LEOPOLD!!!  Gee, I think next time I might go see something different...  nah...  Well, now we're up to yesterday.  New year's eve day.  Nothing special really happened till the evening, we went to dinner at this steakhouse...  It was ok, but nothing spectacular.  Then we headed over to the Metro to go to the MCI center to see the Washington Wizards play the New Jersey Nets.  It was a really good game until the second half, when Michael Jordan scored a whole bunch and I got to sing ""If you're down by 20"".  Our seats were way up in the nosebleed section, but I had fun anyways.  Needless to say, our Wizards won the game.  I don't really remember the final score.  After the game, Sinbad did a comedy show to count down to the new year.  He's a funny guy, and he doesn't have to swear or be disgusting.  I respect that a lot.  So it's 2002...  Hey, our year's a palendrome...  Anyways, I had a pretty good 2001, I think.  I've matured a lot, been through a pretty bad burn, pulled myself up out of the gutter, and met some new friends.  I hope 2002 will be even better.  Tomorrow I'm coming back to Texas for the semester.  I'm really looking forward to this new semester, cause I'll finally really be out on my own.  Well, I've run out of stuff to say, and I have to start packing, so I'll update when I get back to good old Lubbock, TX...  Till then!

Well, in about 2 hours, dad's going to wake me up to leave for the airport, so I can catch my plane back to San Antonio for the Alamo Bowl (YAY!).  I tried to update my journal on Christmas Day, but the website was being screwy, so I just waited.  I feel so refreshed, though.  I was all tense, cause this thing I got for christmas isn't working, and I'm flying, so I'm stressed out.  But I just lit a few candles, and ran a really really incredibly hot bath, and stayed in there for like an hour and a half.  I feel so much better, and I smell really good, too :-D  I already packed most of my stuff, except everyone's presents, cause a couple of them I still have to wrap.  I don't really have much to say, except, see ya at the alamo bowl!

Well, forgive me for not being overly hyped and excited about it being Christmas, but it feels like just another day.  I pretty much know all the stuff I'm getting, cause I've gotten most of it already.  And I know that whole ""Christmas is deeper than presents and commercialism"" speil, so I don't want to write about that either.  I'm not upset or disillusioned, I'm just here, living my life the way I always do.  I'm glad I'm with my family.  And to the thing I'm very happy about is that we're not doing anything very special tonight.  Actually, we had a couple of Jewish people over for dinner: my dad's coworker and his daughter, who's a little older than I am.  I really enjoyed myself, and made a new friend.  I also made gimbab (sushi) for the first time, and I think it turned out well.  I'm looking forward to going to the bowl game in a couple of days, because that's when I'll really get to hang with my friends and let loose.  I think it'll feel more like Christmas than tomorrow morning, because I'll be giving out a lot of gifts to my friends.  I think I may have gone a little overboard, though, because I bought more for my friends than for my family.  I feel a little guilty about that.  But my parents didn't really want me to get a whole lot for them.  I know I probably won't be getting a lot tomorrow, either.  It doesn't bother me.  I think I just stopped caring.  I like being here, at home, with my family more than I like getting stuff that I probably won't use anyways.  My big present was that trip we just took to NYC, which was a really great present all of us got to enjoy.

I'm kind of looking forward to next semester, because I'm so sedate right now.  I feel like my life is stagnating.  I guess I just want to get back into the swing of things and rebound from last semester.  ""Jump back on the horse,"" like Mr. Lucas always tells me.  I don't know if I should say this and jinx myself, but I think I can do a lot better this semester.  Well, that last entry I wrote was so long, I think I wrote myself dry today.  I'll update tomorrow after the shredding of paper and pretending to like what you got ceremony.  

Peace out

I can't sleep.  So what am I gonna do about it?  Write until I can't keep my eyes open anymore!  I just got back from my big trip to the Big Apple, New York, New York...  Big trip...  Yeah, we were there for just over 24 hours, but we covered a lot of ground.  As we were driving on the New Jersey Turnpike, and the monstrous city came into view, the first thing I wanted to do was whistle that little warning call from West Side Story (yeah, I even left it on Jason's voicemail...). First we checked in to the luxurious (NOT) Manhattan Hotel.  I never imagined we would be able to fit 4 people on 2 full size beds into a room half the size of my former dorm room.  But we did it.  Next we went to a matinee performance of Rent!  It was incredible!  I'm still hearing La Vie Boheme and No Day But Today running through my head.  After that, it was a quick (well, not really) jaunt over to Rockefeller center, just so we could see the tree and people ice skating.  But what I didn't know was that Rockefeller Center actually had a mall in it...  So we ate dinner there.  I can't remember the name of the cafe, but it was Italian (I know this because I ate baked ziti).  It was overpriced, but it was still pretty good, and the service was excellent.  By this time my grandma was feeling pretty worn out, so we decided to take a taxi back to the hotel.  First I had to help my dad hail a taxi, cause he didn't know that if the light was off on top of the car, it was occupied, and if the light was on, it was open for business.  The cab ride reminded me of an amusement park ride, it was all padded on every side, and the driver was more agressive than the sum total of everyone driving in Lubbock combined.  Well, when we got to the hotel, I realized that I was pretty tired too, so I put on my PJ's, and my family and I watched an episode of Blind Date (funny show).  Dad kept pushing my mom to go see the Empire State Building, then I thought ""hey, why don't I go?  I know I'm tired, but I don't want to miss anything.""  So I asked them what time it was, and it was only 7:30!!!  I'm NEVER tired that early!  So I dragged myself out of bed, put on my blue jeans, and we walked over to the Empire State Building.  From the outside, it was really neat looking, cause the top 2 segments were lit up in green and red.  We had to pay money to go up in it, of course, but that didn't phase my dad any.  So we get in the elevator, and I realize: hey, I'm afraid of heights...  I wonder how high up this observation deck is...  So the elevator just keeps going...  Up to the 80th floor...  And already I'm kinda scared, and this usher points us towards ANOTHER elevator, and says ""Going up!""  I look over at my parents, horriffied.  But this one only takes us up the last 6 floors.  So we get dumped out into this cozy indoor giftshop.  I'm ok...  Then we go outside on the deck.  And I'm still ok...  And I'm getting braver, so I go over near the edge and think, ""Hey, this isn't so bad...""  And I look out, and everything is beautiful.  And then, I decide to look down.  For about a second, I look as straight down as I can, and I realize that the Macy's I'd walked through earlier is just down there, a block away and 86 stories down...  And I had the worst vertigo in my life.  But I didn't hurl!  WOOHOO!!!  After about 10 minutes, I was able to walk around on the deck, no problem.  I even payed a quarter to look out of one of those binocular things, and I could see Ground Zero and the Statue of Liberty.  It was pretty neat.  After we got down from the building, we walked over to Times Sqare and had some Starbucks, and hopped back over to the hotel for some much deserved R&R.  We woke up the next morning, showered and dressed, and headed out to find a restaurant to have a good breakfast at.  It was just a block away, and I had a pretty good 2 egg breakfast.  Not as good as IHOP, but also not as expensive, so I can't complain.  Then we checked out of the Hotel and took the West Side (story) Highway over to the southern end of the island.  We tried to find our way to the Staton Island Ferry, but all the road blockage was hard to navagate around.  So we just looked at the Statue of Liberty from where we were and headed over to China Town for some shopping.  That was pretty fun, cause I got a Dragonball Z music cd that doesn't have any english words on it other than Dragonball and We Gotta Power (final season theme song).  I also bought a bunch of stuff for other people, but I won't discuss that here because they might read about it and see what I got them, and that would just ruin the whole surprise :-P  After shopping, we ate lunch at a Vietnamese restaurant, and I had some pretty good sesame beef, and the tea was really good.  With our tummies full and our arms laden with bags of presents, we went back to the car and headed back to DC.  I really had a great time, and thanks, Mom and Dad (cause this was one of my christmas presents).

*Cue drastic topic change*

Anyways, I have been doing a lot of wondering lately, about this predicament I'm in.  Not being sure how you feel about someone is hard, especially when you're involved with them.  I want to talk about how I feel, but it's kinda hard, cause I'm not really sure what I would say.  I wonder if this person feels the same towards me as I do towards them, or if I'm just a passing amusement, just convenient...  I think I want something more out of it, but I don't know this person would feel about that.  Being away from the situation doesn't help at all.  It just makes me think harder and try to rationalize it, which I'm not reall sure I want to do.  I miss this person, a lot more than I thought I would, and even though they say they miss me, I don't know whether it's serious or in jest.  I'm strong, and I can handle however this turns out, but I really hope it turns out well, because I don't want another heart-break.  Even though I'd make it through just fine, I don't think I'd ever let myself feel anything deeper than just friendship for anyone again.  Well, I'm getting sleepy and all philosophical, so I'm gonna get going.  I'll probably put in another entry later today, but for me it'll be tomorrow, because I still haven't slept.  Hang loose, everyone, it's Christmas Eve!

Long time no see, huh?  Anyways, what I was saying was that I have a habit of starting journals, writing in them a few times, and then leaving them for about a year.  This time I didn't wait quite so long, but still, 3 months is a pretty long time.  A lot can happen in the life of a College Sophomore over the course of 3 months.  I've gained freinds, weakend ties with others, and gotten a new roommate...  I've successfully moved out of the hellhole we call Knapp Hall, and into a one bedroom apartment with my friend Anthony.  We put my bed in the living room, so now he has a couch... sort of...  Anyways, we have a new apartment lined up for when we go back for the spring semester, and I can't wait to move in.  It's 2 bedrooms, 2 baths, a nice big kitchen, a living room, a dining room, a covered patio with a storage compartment, and a fireplace...  WOOHOO!!!  It's gonna be great to live in something that resembles a home.  

Now, on to current events...  Tomorrow morning, I leave for NYC to go see RENT and do some touristy stuff with my parents and grandma.  We're only staying overnight, so we'll have to cram a bunch of stuff into a day and a half.  Oh well, I think it's better that way.  At least we won't get bored.  

Also, I can't wait to go to the Bowl Game, back in good old San Antonio!!!  First off, we're doing 2 shows instead of one and I get to play in some pep gigs.  Plus, a bunch of my friends get to come and see why I'm always bragging about the Goin' Band!  I also get to do my favorite thing in the world, and watch a few friends open presents that I got for them to see if they like it or not (giving a gift is better than giving one, cause you get to make a person happy AND feel selfless at the same time :-P  when you get a gift, you always end up with that guilty feeling that you don't deserve it... (well at least I do...))  And I get to see my new roommate Anthony, who's pretty much the most fun person I know to spend time with (besides, no one else gets our little DBZ inside jokes :-D).  Yeah, going to San Antonio, should be pretty fun.

I want to comment on a movie that I just recently saw.  It's kind of an off-the-wall musical that was adapted to the screen, called ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"".  The music is really great, and there's a song in there that tells such a great story, I almost cried (almost).  It's called ""The Origin of Love"" and I know, I'm not the one to get all sappy and stuff, but this song was really great.  The story is really great if you're not a prude.  It's about a guy who grew up in communist east berlin, and one day in his teens gets hit on by an american officer (who is also a man), and they get to know each other, and eventually the officer asks Hansel (that's the boys name) to marry him, but to do so, he has to have a sex change operation.  So he does, and it gets botched, which leaves him looking pretty deformed (hence the ""Angry Inch""), and he has a lot of trouble over in america, gets dumped by the officer, and ends up being a transvestite, and babysitting for the children of officers.  He writes awesome rock songs, too.  And he meets a boy named Tommy, with whom he falls in love, and they write songs together (but Tommy wasn't as talented, so it was mostly Hedwig/Hansel)...  When Tommy finds out about the weird deformity, he runs away and later on makes a killing singing Hedwig's songs, and becomes this huge rock sensation.  So Hedwig and a band full of immigrants that he calls ""The Angry Inch"" tour around following Tommy, trying to get the credit Hedwig deserves for writing the songs.  I won't tell you how it ends, but by now, you should be interested or appalled, either is ok...  I loved it though, and I reccommend for anyone who is cool with stuff like that to give the movie a shot.  I'm still singing the songs 2 days after I saw it, so I guess that means the music was good.  

Well, I've pretty much exhausted all the topics I could think to write about, and I have to go pack, so I guess I'll check in after my trip to NYC.  Till later!

It's been a while, hasn't it?  Well, I finally made it back to Tech.  I really missed it.  It was great to get my old marching horn out of storage and play some of the old tunes again.  Tomorrow, well, I guess today I have a gig in the morning for the opening of the new visitors center.  That should be pretty fun.  I can't wait to get back out there on the field.  The first show is supposed to be a traditional show, no coordinate sheets or anything.  That sounds pretty fun.  Can't wait!

It was also cool to see all the people I've been away from all summer.  It's nice to know people remember you.  I haven't felt very good about myself all summer, so this has been a huge self-esteem booster.  Well, I'm really tired, so I'm gonna get going.  Still got a lot of unpacking to do.  I'll get back probably later today.  Peace out!

I made it from College Park, MD to Weatherford, TX in around 25 hrs on the road, with only short breaks to eat and gas up, and one break to sleep.  I think that's pretty good time!  Now I'm at my buddy Leslie's house, and I'm gonna chill here for a couple days before going back to San Antonio to pick up my new roommate.  

I'm really looking forward to getting back to college.  I think this year's going to be a lot better than last year.  I'm definitely going to be more prepared, that's for sure.  I just hope that this year I can establish a larger group of dependable friends.  It'll be a lot easier to cope with things if I have people to turn to.  I know last year changed me a lot, because for the most part of the second semester, I was alone.  That shouldn't be the case this year.  I have my new roommate, and old highschool friend, Melissa.  I have Leslie to go to Kuk Sool with, and Jason to help keep awake when he has a big project.  I have Ross to talk to on the internet, and try to convince to go to Texas Tech.  And I know most of the time, Allie and Josh will be there if I need to talk.  I just hope that I can get through my slump in playing my trombone.  It seems like ever since I got back from that trip to england, I haven't felt good about playing or anything that has to do with my trombone.  I didn't even want to talk about it.  I'm going to talk to my old teacher when I go back to San Antonio and see if there's any advice he can give me to help me get through this.  I really hope it's not permanent.  Well, I think that's about all I've got to say right now.  I'll be back in a few days to give you an update.  Peace out!

Well, I had a pretty productive day today...  Got my car washed and cleaned out, filled the tank up, and got a kit so dad can flush out the radiator.  Then I got dad a birthday present: new biking gloves.  He turns 44 tomorrow.  Doesn't look a day over 35, I think.  Oh well...  When I got home, mom and I started sorting out my stuff, to see what I didn't really need to have with me at college.  I've pared down a lot since last year.  I got almost a whole suitcase packed.  

After that, I felt so good about getting all that stuff done, I treated myself to dozing on the couch and watching cartoons :-P  Then I got a creative spurt, and decided to write some more of my fanfic (the one I can't post cause Fanfiction.net is having technical difficulties)...  I got up to page 8.  That's a lot of writing...  8 pages of relatively nothing.  No double spaceing, 12 point font.   Hehe, just kidding.  It's not exactly PWP (plot, what plot?), but it's not like it's an epic or anything.  *sigh* I just wish I could post the damn thing and get some reviews.  Well, I'm kinda out of things to say, so I'll get going.  If anyone would like to beta-read my fic, please let me know, and I'll get it to you.  I'm open to any suggestions to make my work better.  Thanx!  Peace out!

I am in pretty good spirits today, since I got a call from my manager saying that the last two inventories I was scheduled for before I left don't really require me :-)  Then my mom and I went to breakfast at IHOP.  I love it when it's just me and my mom.  We can talk about anything, and she always has good advice for any question I ask.  Plus it's great to hear her go off on people.  She was raised in the projects, so insults come easy to her.  She's my opposite in that respect, and I think that's why I think my mom's so cool.  

Anyways, after IHOP, we went shopping on base.  I guess I didn't really realize that I had money until today, cause I was looking at this DVD player that was on sale, and I said, ""Ya know, I'd really like to have a DVD player for my dorm room...""  Mom said, ""Well, buy it!  You're working, you've got money!""  Sure enough, I had plenty of money in my wallet.  I called up my future roommate and talked it over with her.  It turns out she's getting a new TV, so it works out pretty well.  I can't wait to try out the new DVD player :-D

Then mom and I went grocery shopping.  Not an incredible amount of fun, but it was a chance to just chill and be with mom, so I was happy.  Then I came home, watched my cartoons, had dinner, and now I'm writing in my journal.  Gotta love those nice lazy days.  

*sigh* I did read one of my friends journal entries before getting on here.  He seems to feel like he's doomed to remain single forever.  I've felt the same way for most of my life.  But to him, all I can say is: don't lose heart.  Someone may already be looking at you in a different light.  I can't really think of anything else to say, but I'll come back later.  Peace out!

Well, it's been a couple of days, but there's really nothing new going on...  There's a big development in my sleep pattern, though!  I figured out that if I only sleep every other night, I actually get tired enough to actually fall asleep and stay asleep during the night.  I don't know how well this is going to work at college, though...  The lack of sleep has got me clinging desperately at the ledge of the chasm of my sanity.  I've got the ""Yellow"" running through my head...  Does anyone know how annoying that song can get?! 

""hen you have insomnia, nothing's real.  Everything's fake.  Everything's a copy of a copy of a copy.""  Oh, such true words for me.  I feel like I'm not the original me, I'm the me that's been run through the copier, making a copy of the copy, about 200 times...  Ok, I'm not gonna get all deep on ya here, journal...  *sigh* I just can't think of anything to say!  Well, maybe it'll sort itself out.  I'll come back later.  Peace out!

I got a day off today!  It was great!  I slept until around 3pm.  I'm such a sleepyhead.  

Anyways, today was really great.  I took my dog, Donny, to the vet to get his monthly allergy shot, so he stopped scratching himself, which makes everyone's life around the house easier.  Mom went down to Richmond to visit my cousin and her week-old baby, Hunter.  After I got back from the vet's it was just dad and me :-)  I watched my cartoons while he fiddled around on the computer, and then we decided to go to the mall and see Planet of the Apes.  

When we got there, all the shows were sold out until 10:40.  The stores in the mall were open till 9:30, so we figured, why not go?  We cruised the mall for a couple hours, got some Starbucks Frappucinos (YUM), and I got the two newest Dragonball Z videos (I just watched one, it's SWEET).  Then we went to the theater early to get in line, so we wouldn't have to sit apart from each other.  

The movie was GREAT!  I've never seen the original, so I really didn't know what to expect.  The costumes were AWESOME!  I love Tim Burton, and moreover, I love Danny Elfman!  The music was INCREDIBLE!  The plot had very few holes (except the end, I'm still wondering how the hell they're gonna explain that one...)  If you're wondering how it ends: everyone dies (j/k, that's an inside joke in my family).  But I have nothing but good things to say about it.  It was the best movie I've seen all summer.  Some other good ones for you, if you get to the theater and can't see Planet of the Apes: Swordfish (love Hugh Jackman), The Score (love Edward Norton), I'm still pondering whether I liked AI or not, but nevertheless, it was a great film.  My parents reccomend Legally Blonde...  I, however, am waiting till it comes out on dvd.  Anyways, I have another DBZ video waiting for me, since I'm incapable of sleep right now...  Yes, I'm still an insomniac.  I'll come back later today and update you.  Peace out!

Why the hell can't I sleep!?!?!?!?  I have to be at a sears at 7AM, and I still can't sleep!  I figured maybe writing something might help drain me, or something...  *sigh*  If anyone knows anything that can help insomnia, please, help me out, I'm begging you!!!  I've had a tough time getting a good night's sleep since I was a highschool sophomore.  But it must run in the family, cause my dad's the same way.  Oh well...  I think I'm gonna work on my fic.  It might be ready to post tomorrow.  I'll put up the url once it's posted so you can read it (please, please, please read it, I need reviews)...  Talk to you later, journal.  Peace!

Today is truly a joyous day in the Fisk household!  My dad got us a DSL line :-D  It's just too bad it came too late for me to watch my favorite cartoon online (the website on which it was posted decided to renovate itself, and when it comes back online, they're charging to watch the cartoons...)  Oh well, Que sera, sera.  I'm enjoying having a fast connection once again.  After being spoiled by the screaming ethernet connection at my dorm, coming home to a 56K modem was excruciating.  

Anyways, I've decided to post my first chapter to my very first dragonball z fanfiction within the week.  It's already finished; right now I'm just editing and working on the second chapter.  Even if you don't know much about dragonball z, I encourage you to read it once it's posted, since I really need the reviews.  I'm so nervous that people won't like it.  

Back to personal life...  Today was pretty nice.  I had to get up around 4:45, shower, eat a pop-tart, and go to work.  Luckily, I was assigned to iventory a very small store in the mall just down the road from my house, so it only lasted 3 hours.  Afterwards, I came home and went straight back to bed.  You'd be surprised how much an inventory can take out of you!  I slept until 5:00!!!  When I got up, I watched my cartoons with my grandmother, who surprisingly is really getting into them.  Mom even sat down to watch a little.  She's starting to remember the characters' names.  *sniff* I'm so proud :-P

*Sigh* Just a week and a half 'till I come back to texas...  I like being here with my parents and all, but I'm ready to see my friends.  I plan on making every moment count before I have to leave them again and go back to College.  I just hope this year will be better for me.  I've made a few resolutions...  1: I will keep my room clean.  2: I will not miss class unless I am truly incapable of getting out of bed.  3: I will practice 3 hours per day.  4: I will balance my bank account!!!  5: I will NOT MISS CLASS!!!  Wait a minute...  I think I said that one already...  Oh well.  It's a very important one.  For anyone going to college anytime soon, this is the best advice I can possibly give you.  If you follow this advice, you will most likely pass every course you take.  Are you ready?  Cause this is important...  Here it is: GO TO CLASS; DO YOUR HOMEWORK; TURN IT IN!  That's it.  If you follow that advice, you should do fine.  Well, I'm done preaching for now, but if anyone has questions about going to college, especially if you're going to be very far away from everything and everyone you know, feel free to ask me.  I'm sure I can help.  Peace out!

*Yawn* So far I've had a tough day...  I had to get up at 4:30, shower, cram some pop-tarts down my throat, and get to work by 5:30.  We inventoried a Sears today.  NOT my favorite store.  I ended up staying until 2:40.  When I got home, my mom had pity on me, and made me some lunch, then I went back to bed for an hour or so.  I would've slept longer, but I couldn't miss my cartoons!  (I'm such a kid) :-P  Anyways, my day took a turn for the better, cause watching Dragonball Z always cheers me up, even if my favorite character is getting the snot kicked out of him...  Well, it's time for dinner (yay, manwich!) so I might update you later if anything interesting happens.  Peace out!

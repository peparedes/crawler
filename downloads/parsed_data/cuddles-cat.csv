I am nervous for some reason.  I was hoping my mom would take Cassie over night so I could sleep in on Friday, but Cassie hasn't been napping when she has been over there so she might be nervous about having her for night when it is more important.  Cassie has been getting up at 6 am and with the new medicine I am on I am very sleepy. I am tired of having to get up early.  I guess we will see tomorrow."

"event","My birthday yesterday turned out pretty well.  Chris was fighting off a cold and didn't sleep well Monday night so he called in a sick day.  He let me sleep in a little.   When I got up, they gave me a hand blender for my fruit smoothies and told me they are getting me a new bike. They decorated the wrapping paper with stickers and made a banner. Then Chris went to lay down for a while.  Once Cassie and Chris woke up from their naps.  We went to Olive Garden for a late lunch/early dinner. I love their salad and breadsticks. The meal was very good and I have some leftovers to each today.  Then we went to Cold Stone Creamery for Cassie and my free birthday ice creams.  We only eat 1/2 of each and brought the left overs home for today.  I didn't want a cake because I am still trying to lose weight, of course the ice creams were pretty fattening but very yummy.   

When we got back we went to the backyard to play at the new playground that they put in a couple of weeks ago. Cassie was having fun trying to play with the older kids that were out. They were nice letting her play catch with them for the most part.  Towards the end she asked them to play with her since they had taken a break from the games they were playing and one of the boys kept tricking her. Telling her to go long and then he would go & hide.  She took it well. His friends got mad at him saying he was being mean to her.  So he threw it to her.  Then he did it again and she started to get upset so we headed home.  

Then Chris tried to give Cassie a bath, but she has a bad diaper rash so she didn't want anything to do with it but I think he got it done. Not a pleasant time with her screaming. Then he read stories and put her sown for the night.

Then we watched a dvd and relaxed until bed.  Overall I had a very nice birthday, it was nice to have Chris home, but I sat around waiting for him to make a decision if he felt up to doing anything.  I was upset during the day that my family didn't email or call during the day.  My parents called while we were out saying their days were crazy and my sister called in the evening saying her day was crazy also. So they were forgiven."

"event","Cassie had her 3 yr check up this morning.  She was very happy and smiley for Dr. S.  She is 37 inches tall 75%  and 34.7 lbs 80% so she is proportional.  He said that she is looking good.  The one area we were concerned about was her eating, but he said she is a intermittent eater, like a boa. (Eats a lot for a meal or a day and then is set for a time-barely eating for a couple of days.) He said this was fine, just that we should start her on a daily multiple vitamin. He was glad that she hasn't had anymore wheezing episodes and hopes that she has out grown that. He did say she had some fluid in her ear leftover from when she was sick, but he isn't concerned about it because he didn't tell us to do anything for it.  (I am still sick so I'm not thinking straight and didn't think to ask him about it.)

She is in a good mood. I hope she will play by herself today because I feel awful. I need to get better because we have a birthday party to go to tomorrow, and I doubt Chris would want to take her by himself since he really doesn't know everyone very well. (If I go I will just sit away from everyone so I don't get anyone sick.)"

I took Cassie outside since the weather was really nice. We went out in the morning to blow bubbles and then she wanted to go somewhere so we ran out errands. I had to go out yesterday to get stamps to send out Cassie thank you cards, get new key copies for our parents that Chris installed, x-rays of my back for my doctors appointment(I thought it was next week, but isn't until the following week).  All the running around didn't help being sick.  My mom came over so I could get the x-ray without Cassie since she freaked out with the nurses last time. I was hoping that she would stick around to take Cassie outside, but the sky looked awful and it started to drizzle. So she left and I had to take Cassie outside.  Of course, it didn't rain so she could have stayed.  After she left Cassie was demanding to go out. So we went to play at the new playground in the backyard and then more bubbles for a bit.

All the running around didn't help how I was feeling.  :(  Time to relax or as much as Cassie will let me."

"event","Friday Chris told me on his way home from work that he hurt his back somehow during the day. :(  So I started worrying about Cassie's birthday party on Saturday. My ankle is still not 100% and I didn't want to have to chase after Cassie in the pool. He stayed in bed all Saturday morning to rest his back so he could be at the party and be in the water with Cassie. So I had to deal with Cassie and get everything together for the party. Each day we had told her about her party because saying it was getting closer and that it was a swimming party which was a mistake.  Yesterday all she wanted to do was go to her party.   We had it at our local indoor pool because they take care of everything, it is very responsible priced and she loves swimming.  

I needed to make sure she took a good nap so she wasn't a grump for her party. So we went up early since she was up bright and early and very tired.  Of course she barely slept an hour and then I had to deal with her begging to go swimming when she woke up.  Of course Chris was still laying down so I needed to delay her as long as I could. We went downstairs. I had her gather some things. Then we changed into our swimsuits slowly. Finally Chris came down so she was happy to finally be going swimming. 

Overall, I think it went great.  But since Chris back was hurting him I needed to be in the water with Cassie. So I didn't get to really talk to the Mommies.  Most of the dad's were in the water with the kids.  All the kids looked like they were having a blast.   Cassie had fun she wanted to go back today for swimming.  The Swim Center Party includes hot dogs, soda, chips, ice cream and the cake. I got a few extra hot dogs so the parents could have some.  I think everyone had enough to eat.  Well, they didn't do the cake right.  I had said our theme was Rubber Duckies, the cake had Mallard Ducks on it. Everyone got a kick out of it. 

This morning Cassie woke up with a fever and runny nose.  I hope she feels better for by Tuesday her actually Birthday.  With her being sick we had to cancel our 2 playgroups this week that we are suppose to host.  Chris' back is still really bad so I couldn't sleep in and had to get up with Cassie.  I brought up her presents upstairs last night so Chris could be with her when she opened them.  Luckily she got some cool presents so she played for a while as I tried to sleep.  I am still really tired and sore.  My ankle did pretty well yesterday except when 2 kids stepped on it wrong.  So today it was very sore.   My parents got Cassie a trike so We had to go out in the windy cold weather to take a ride.  Grandpa got her a doll house, luckily it had some furniture with it, but we will have to get her some more."

Panda cubs drink milk at the Giant Panda Breeding Center in Chengdu, China Friday Feb. 9, 2007. A mini-baby boom last year has pushed up the number of pandas bred in captivity in China to 217, state media said Wednesday, Feb. 7, 2007. Some 34 pandas were born by artificial insemination in 2006 and 30 survived, both record numbers for the endangered species."

"event","I just wanted to let everyone know that Cassie has strep throat. :( When we got home from playgroup she didn't nap. She was very warm when we took her temperature 102. On thursday morning she had a temp of 103.4 with no other sympton except fever. :( I called the doctor to see if she needed to be seen, but they said she needed to have a fever for 3 days. So we got an appointment for Friday. She has strep. Hopefully no one else gets it from playgroup on wednesday, if they do I am really sorry.

Update on me: I saw the orthopedist Friday morning before Cassie's appointment, and he thinks I might have a break :( He is sending me for a MRI, but I have to wait until Tuesday or Wednesday for my insurance to approve it. :( He wants me to stay off of it again until after the MRI. :( I have been in a lot of pain, but was trying to push thru it to help with Cassie. Since Chris had a bunch of things he needed to do to accept the new job and so he could start soon. (car stuff, paperwork, security clearance and lots of phone calls) I guess I have been doing too much. Not using the crutches enough. Of course now I have to stay off of my foot and she is sick and he still has more to do. :( Hopefully the antibiotics work quickly and she feels better quickly. She is very cranky and crying when her fever is high.

Friday was not a good day for us. The next news I didn't find out until saturday, but it happened on Friday.

My dad's sister died of a heart attack Friday. She had mild heart attack in August and was and maybe hospitalized for a while and was released. She has been seeing a cardiologist since then. On wednesday she was admitted to the hospital for a medication adjustment. She was release on friday morning because she was feeling better. On friday afternoon, her neighbor came over to visit and didn't like they way she looked so called my cousin Abby. They called 911. She was taken to the hospital and sedated. She had another heart attack and they weren't able to revive her. So she died in her sleep. It is a big shock to everyone. The funeral will be on wednesday morning in New Jersey so I will be off of LJ and chat for a couple of days.

I was very close to my aunt so this is really hard for me. I used to spend weeks with her when I had school vacations either going to her or her coming to my house. 

Depending on how Cassie is feeling we will possibly see my grandfather on our way up on tuesday who doesn't have much longer to live, but he has been sick for awhile. When I talked to my mom on saturday that is who I thought she was talking about. 

I have to wait until friday for the MRI and she said it will take 2-3 hours to complete suppositively. Yuk. Then I can't have a follow up until the following Wednesday so we won't make it to another playgroup. 

I will be very glad when Chris starts working, Cassie is healthy, and my ankle is better. And we get back to a normal life."

"event","I had my appointment with the orthopedist.  He said I severly sprained my ankle which is almost worse than a break and will take a while to heal. He asked if the air split was giving me enough support. Nope. So he said he could cast it or put me in an air cast boot. I choose the boot because I could remove it to take showers. I really like showers and am used to shower every day and showering everyother day has been hard for me. But it is a pain in the butt to shower lately. The boot gives me more support and I was actually able to walk on it alittle. I go back the first week in November to check on its status and see what the next step is. 

I was in a lot of pain because they had to change the position of my foot.  But am starting to be able to walk on it some.  Thou the air blatter part broke yesterday so I had to go in to get it replaced.  

I am still losing weight. Yay!  Eventhough I am not really exercising I am still slowly losing weight from eating right. I was afraid that I would start gaining weight.

"event","We went to the follow appointment with my primary physician.  She wants me to stay off of my ankle for a week and go to get x-rays in 10 days. I need to stay off of it, put it up and ice it.  Hopefully Chris has the rest of the week off to help since he doesn't have any vacation time. (There is a sewer problem at work so the definately have today and tomorrow off.)  Cassie is too demanding to take care of when I need to stay off my foot.  The dr said a break can show up later so we will see where to go once I have the x-ray. 

I am still in pain. Plus my clumsiness doesn't help.  I need to get used to crutches again.  I have problems getting shakey and then putting my foot down. :("

"event","Saturday after dropping Cassie off at my parents house, Chris and I headed to Cumberland for a night away since my parents are going to be away for our anniversary. We stopped at a visitor center to use the bathroom and look at Sideling Hill.  I went to throw away my can and stepped off the wet curb and felt excruciating pain and a pop. I badly sprained my ankle.  It swelled up really big and was very painful so we called my parents to find the closest hospital. We situated me in the back seat with my foot on the reclined front seat with what little ice we had.  Every bump and movement hurt really bad. We ended up spending the afternoon (1-5) at Washington Hospital in Haggerstown were they x-rayed my foot and gave me an air split, crunches and prescription for pain killers.  Then we spent another 1 1/2 hrs trying to fill my prescription so I could survive the ride home, since they didn't give me any medication at the hospital and I was in a lot of pain.  At the moment I hate CVS, the first one took our prescription and then told us it would be 4 hrs. Chris said we couldn't wait that long so sent us to another one a mile away.  Drove to the second one was waiting in line and he realized they gave him back the wrong prescription.  They called the other CVS, but they couldn't find my script so we needed to go back to the first one.  They still couldn't find it when we arrived back.  Finally found it and filled it right away since they realized I must be in a lot of pain and they had messed up. I was in the car crying because I didn't know how I was going to handle Cassie when I couldn't walk without the crutches and Chris has no vacation time and I was in a lot of pain. I need to stay off of it and keep it elevated.  It is my right foot so I can't drive and probably won't be able for a while. When Chris came to the car he said not to worry about it, his dad has vacation time so he can help out.  My mom is going to come over tomorrow to help since she has off because of Yom Kippur. Tuesday FIL will come over if I need him.   Wednesday both my parents have off so hopefully they will help me.  Playgroup is suppose to have our Halloween pictures and then a good bye lunch for one of our members. I hope one of my parents can help.  One of the other moms offered to drive us, but I can't push Cassie in the stroller and she will run off if she is walking so it would be easier if one of my parent would help.

I was also upset that I messed up our short trip. Chris said he had a feeling that something would have messed up the trip-his cough or my back.  That it was ok. We picked up Outback my favorite meal and it was very yummy. We watched a movie and then went to bed.  We slept late which was nice since I was up alot because I was so uncomfortable.  We have a trip in November to look forward to that we will just have to make extra special.

I hope this injury doesn't stop me from losing weight.

And so I said she has gotten taller since her birthday party. So she says ""Friends, birthday, cake, hats, mommy hat, me hat, dadda hat, cake"" She kept repeating the words. 
So off and on this morning she mentions something about a birthday and cake
The screen door just made a noise and she said Dadda home with cake. 

She was so cute.  At Wee Friends class it was one of the little girls birthday which started her saying everything again.  Me cake, me hat, me birthday. luckily she got distracted by ring a round the rosie so she didn't start crying and insisting on cake since there wasn't any.

She has an amazing imagination.  The slides from the 2 playgrounds close to us have been removed, we don't know the reason.  Hopefully the are just upgrading them, but it has been a couple of weeks.  Anyways, Cassie came up with a story about them, I don't remember them, but it was so cute."

I feel alittle better, still have lots of sinus pressure that hurts.  And now Chris has come down with it. He doesn't have any vacation time, but had to miss today because he was feeling really bad.

This past week because I was sick didn't exercise much, but still lost 3.5 lbs I guess because when I did eat it wasn't much. I am looking forward to exercising next week to help loss more.  The websites say that I should lose 2 lbs a week so for the contest I am next week I should meet that goal of 20 lbs for 2 months, thou I am reaching it in just over 1 month. Go me!! 

I know Cassie will be excited to be able to go outside again. I am. And to be able to participate in our activities again."

I have realized that my weight has gotten out of hand and have joined a weightloss competition with my extended playgroup.  In 2 weeks I have lost 11 lbs.  I am very proud of myself, but I know it will probably slow down.  I am going to do my best to keep up and loss as much as I can.  I have cut out most soda from my life.  When I really have a craving I will have a coke zero, but mostly it is water.  Cassie and I have been going to the mall and walking.  I go around 3 or so times with her in the stroller and then I let her walk/run for a few.  I am definately getting exercise.  I have started to do other exercises for toning and lossing in other areas. We have also changed our eating.  Eating healthier. Cutting out the bad stuff. So far I am tied in pounds loss with one other mom, but everyone is doing well.

"event","<lj-cut text=""Just A Mom!!!!"">A woman, renewing her driver's license at the County Clerk's office was asked by the woman recorder to state her occupation. She hesitated, uncertain how to classify herself. ""What I mean is,"" explained the recorder, ""do you have a job or are you just a...?""

""Of course I have a job,"" snapped the woman.
""I'm a Mom.""
""We don't list 'Mom' as an occupation, ""housewife covers it,"" said the recorder emphatically.

I forgot all about her story until one day..I found myself in the same situation, this time at our own Town Hall. The Clerk was obviously a career woman, poised, efficient and possessed of a high sounding title like, ""Official Interrogator"" or ""Town Registrar.""
""What is your occupation?"" she probed.

What made me say it? I do not know. The words simply popped out.
*""I'm a Research Associate in the field of Child Development and Human Relations.""*

The clerk paused, ball-point pen frozen in midair and looked up as though she had not heard right. I repeated the title slowly emphasizing the most significant words. Then I stared with wonder as my pronouncement was written in bold, black ink on the official questionnaire.

""Might I ask,"" said the clerk with new interest, ""just what you do in your field?""

Coolly, without any trace of fluster in my voice, I heard myself reply, ""I have a continuing program of research, (what mother doesn't) in the laboratory and in the field, (normally I would have said indoors and out).
I'm working for my Masters, (the whole darned family) and already have four credits (all daughters). Of course, the job is one of the most demanding in the humanities, (any mother care to disagree?) and I often work 14 hours a day, (24 is more like it). But the job is more challenging than most run-of-the-mill careers and the rewards are more of a satisfaction rather than just money.""

There was an increasing note of respect in the clerk's voice as she completed the form, stood up and personally ushered me to the door.

As I drove into our driveway, buoyed up by my glamorous new career, I was greeted by my lab assistants -- ages 13, 7, and 3. Upstairs I could hear our new experimental model, (a 6 month old baby) in the child development program, testing out a new vocal pattern. I felt I had scored a beat on bureaucracy! And I had gone on the official records as someone more distinguished and indispensable to mankind than ""just another Mom.""
Motherhood! . What a glorious career! Especially when there's a title on the door. 

Does this make grandmothers ""Senior Research associates in the field of Child Development and Human Relations"" and great grandmothers ""Executive Senior Research Associates""? I think so!!! I also think it makes Aunts ""Associate Research Assistants.

Please send this to another Mom, Grandmother, Aunt, and other
friends you know.

May your troubles be less, your blessings be more and nothing but happiness come through your door!<<lj-cut>/"

"event","Anthrocon was a blast.  It was nice to have a break from being a Mom, but I did miss Cassie.  Normally we arrive on Wednesday or Thursday, but since <lj user=""Nonsanity""> doesn't have many days of vacations left we dropped Cassie off on thursday night and left Friday morning. We didn't leave as early as we would have liked since we were up finishing my head rewire and packing. We made good time, but just missed opening ceremonies since our room wasn't ready and the hotel lot was full.  We parked in a lot behind the convention center since we couldn't find the entrance to there garage. By the time we got back we were able to check in. Got our Super Sponsor registration bags. Stopped by OPs to say Hi and say <lj user=""KuddlePup"">. 

<lj-cut text=""Read More"">
We got to see a lot of old friends and meet some new ones. Nonsanity donated 2 Obilivion (1 PC and 1 XBox 360) to the charity auction which went for $225. (If you know who won them could let us know, he is curious). Nonsanity was asked; and wanted to be at; about 3 panels at the same time all time.  He wasn't lead on any of the panels, but asked to help. 

He did the graphics for KP's Anthropoly which was a hit again.  He threw in some of the jokes from last year and had fun with the names because he couldn't hear very well.  I did call him 2 times to correct him, but it was still funny.  It was a blast.  The prizes were great. KP did a great job.

<lj user=""2_gryphon"">'s show and <lj user=""uncleKage""> were both excellent.  And their benefit performance was a blast.  We were in the second row for most of the events, thanks to being Super Sponsors.  Kage had Peter Morwood set to sit in front of me for the Masquerade and Story Hour and I was ready to catch him if he fell backwards again, but he didn't show up. (If you were at the Anthropoly you would know what I am referring to.)  During the Masquerade they showed two <a href=""http://www.fluffandsuch.com/what.shtml"">Fluff and Such Videos</a>, Major Tom and I'm with You. Kage called Nonsanity up anytime he could(during the closing cermonies also.) And KP called him up after the second video which had a special appearance by Chuckles on stage.

Before the Charity Benefit Kage was on stage getting ready and he had a plastic bin and the person in front of us said something like ""What's in the bin?  Nonsanity or something?""  Nonsanity sat up and put his hands on their shoulders and said ""No, I am sitting behind you.""  It was so funny. Kage and 2 are great by themselves, but together they are amazing. 

We went out every night after the activities in suit.  It was a blast.  Very hot, but fun. It has been 3 years since I have been in my suit so it was fun to get back into it. I need to learn to be better at expressing emotions and things, but it was fun.  The Parade was fun, but long and hot.  We got a nice cool breeze when we were taking the group picture. 

We had dinner with <lj user=""TonyRingtail""> on Sunday.  Then attended the Dorsai's party which was lots of fun. <lj user=""filkerTom""> sang some songs and we ended up buying his cd's.  We will definately attend his concert next AC if he is there. We were sorry we missed his show. </lj-cut>

Thank you to the AC Staff you all did a terrfic job. Wish we had more time to talk to some people."

I feel bad because she enjoyed herself last year interacting with everyone, but it was a pain to have to sit in the dark after she went to bed early.  With the possibility of moving to California we didn't reserve a suite or 2 connecting rooms in the main hotel.  We got a reservation in the overflow hotel when we got back from California which would have been a pain having to walk a distance for naps and bed. My parents said we deserve a break and they are taking Cassie. We did get a reservation in the main hotel when they opened up again.  Now we can attend all the events we want and don't have to worry about cranky baby, naps or bed time.

We made costumes our first year we attended the convention. It was a last minute decision and the bodies look like pjs.  They are very loose and baggy.  I used a basic pattern and didn't fit it to our bodies. After having Cassie I haven't had the time or any clue how to adjust them. So we are asking for help to modify our bodies.

We were told they would be back at 9:30 on saturday because they were missing pieces.  They called at 10:30 saying they were on there way and were in traffic would arrive in about an hour.  They arrived at 12.  They stopped to have a lunch break which I was annoyed about, but it worked out because they had installed a 5 wire when they need a 8 wire so Chris ran to Sear to get a Fish-tape so they could have the 8 wire and not a bunch of patches. They finished at about 4. Yay!  Of course once the air is fixed the weather gets cooler.  Why couldn't we have this weather last week. It is really nice to be cold.

Unfortunately Cassie is sick also. She has a runny nose and is miserable.  :( We seem to be passing this around playgroup. Poor baby sick on her birthday. :(  Yesterday was her family birthday party at my parents house and since she had been up most of the night on Saturday night she and Chris were late so they could take a nap. (I had the least amount of sleep, but got up to get everything to my parents and get it ready) My sister was annoyed that we had to wait for Cassie and Chris to get there, but we were trying to make it so that she wasn't cranky. Everybody had fun once the birthday girl arrived and she enjoyed herself. Thou all she wanted to eat was cake and then after my nephew had a lollipop she wanted one also. Which she really enjoyed.  Then she was on a sugar high for a while and crashed hard because she was still tired. She was so cute when she saw the pile of presents. Dancing around pointing at them and then herself and then dancing around again.  For her birthday today I am just trying to keep her happy and giving her whatever she wants so she doesn't cry and make her nose run more. Chris didn't stay home today which I had asked to do so we could try and make it more special. He was a little late so we could open the few presents we had gotten her. 

Unfornately she got sick at playgroup which we seem to be passing around so some of the others are sick also.  Hopefully everyone is healthy by Saturday for the joint birthday party. I am suppose to have playgroup here this week, but with Cassie and a few others being sick I don't know what we are going to do. I have food, but I can freeze some of it for another time.  I am waiting to hear from the other moms about what there feelings are.  After Cassie goes to sleep tonight I will contnue cleaning so I will be ready if they still have it here.  Maybe we will host a sick baby playgroup, at least those from last week who were exposed to this, but then I don't want to exclude those who didn't make it last week.  But we also don't want to make anyone else sick. I will try not to worry about it.

Hopefully everyone in playgroup is healthy for Saturday's playgroup party."

"event","Chris has a hard time getting up in the morning. He alarm goes off around 8:30 every morning and if I don't hear him up and moving around I yell up to him ""Dadda are you awake?""  On Saturday Cassie and I went to ToysRUs to get some blocks my aunt sent a check for that have been out of stock and some birthday presents.  Before we went I ask Chris if he wanted me to get Chick-Fil-a for lunch and he said sure.  He was still sick so he went back to bed.  When we got back I called up to him "" Dadda Are you awake?"" My little munchkin started yelling up to him ""Dadda you awake!"" Now Cassie barely talks but she started yelling up to him.  Every few time it was understandable that she was saying ""Dadda""""awake"". The last couple of days when I yell up she will start yelling to him.  And then she does it again when she hears him coming down the stairs.  Mostly it is just her babble but everyonce in a while it sounds like real words."

"event","The Breast Cancer site is having trouble getting enough people to click on their site daily to meet their quota of donating at least one free mammogram a day to an underprivileged woman. It takes less than a minute to go to their site and click on ""donating a mammogram"" for free (pink window in the middle).

This doesn't cost you a thing. Their corporate sponsors/advertisers use the number of daily visits to donate mammogram in exchange for advertising. Here's the web site! Pass it along to people you know. http://www.thebreastcancersite.com/"

"event","I hate being sick. :(   I have caught what Cassie has a bad cold. My body is run down and is having a hard time fighting it. I am coughing, runny nose, soar throat and head ache.  Luckily Cassie is starting to feel better, but now I feel awful and don't have the energy to chase her or entertain her.  Yesterday was warm and I wanted to take her out, but I didn't want to infect anyone else if we didn't at the beginning of last week when she started getting sick. I hope we didn't. We are going to miss play group tomorrow and I was looking forward to adult communication. :(  I am suppose to have play group here next week, but I will have to see if anyone else can take it or trade weeks with me. I don't have the energy to clean and Chris has to work all weekend again. :(  Hopefully this will be the last weekend. The house really needs a good cleaning and vacuumming before anyone comes over. And I need to really clean all of Cassie's toys. I am exhausted just thinking about it.  Cassie didn't nap well today so hopefully she will go down easy tonight and sleep well.

Stay Healthy!"

"event","Cassie was sounding really bad yesterday and last night so I decide I would take her to the doctor to make sure she was doing ok and didn't have an ear infection or cough was something serious since it had been a week and she was getting worse.  Last night she was up alot, but didn't cry, thankfully.  I went up about 11:30 and she sat up, but kept laying down.  Eventhough I said I wasn't going to wait up for her to fall back to sleep, I was worried about her so I didn't. At 2am it looked like she was finally settling down so I turned off the video monitor and went to sleep.  I heard she cough on and off, but she didn't cry. Cassie is 28 lbs 2 oz. Her lungs are clear and ears aren't infected and don't have fliud. She just has a cold. He said to just give her advil or tylenol and no cough or cold medicine.  I told him the RN had told us to give her dimetapp and he said he would talk to her because it wouldn't do anything and could possible make her worse. If she starts wheezing give her breathing treatment. To watch for her signs of trouble breathing- nose flaring and big difference on chest while breathing. He also said to watch for fever and if she doesn't get better in a week to call. The last time she was seen was in September and she was just about 26 lbs so she is doing well and not gaining too much weight. He didn't say what percental she is in and I forgot to ask. He commented on how happy she is and friendly which has always been the case even when she was sickist her first year of life. 

She is finishing her lunch and then hopefully will take a nice long nap.  She is very tired and so am I."

"event","Cassie is sick :(  My mouth still hurts :( and my body is fight whatever Cassie has. She is very congested and has an awful cough. I will probably take her to the doctor tomorrow if she isn't better. I am exhausted. I tried to go to bed early last night but she was awake in her crib. She finally fell back to slept. So we didn't have to go in. I should have just gone to sleep and been woken if she needed me, but I wanted to watch and make sure she was ok. Chris made a new icon that is cute! :)  

Sad news story. Basically a whole family of adopted kids are killed in accident in Florida and students hurt in the bus that the car collided with...

"event","Today Cassie got to spend the day with Papa because my tooth chipped and was very sensitive.  Chris' insurance just changed so I needed to find a new dentist.  Luckily the dentist I called could squeeze me in. I had to gather all of Cassie's stuff and speed to my parents house to drop her and get back in barely enough time.  I ended up needing a root canal. I hate dentist.  Boy does my mouth hurt.  Luckily Cassie behaved herself.  I wasn't expecting them to go ahead with the root canal today.  I didn't have a chance to call my dad and had no clue about the time.  I arrive at the office at 11:30 and it was 1:30 when I was finished.  Cassie and Papa had a blast playing.  She eat lunch and went down without a problem and get this slept for 2 hrs. She never sleeps for that long for me.  We went up to check on her and I saw feet kicking, but it looked like she might have slept for longer she wasn't fully awake. I guess she likes to be warm and cozy.  She spilled something on her pants so he took them off and put them in the drying. He couldn't find their crib sheet so he put a flannel sheet down and turned the heat up and then put a quilt on her. He was luckily she didn't take the diaper off.  Maybe now he will feel more comfortable taking care of her. One thing, he couldn't figure out why the diaper wouldn't fit. He had it on backwards.  hehe :) But they had fun.  Of course the stupid dentist only gave me motrin to take which didn't help so I will take my last tylenol 3 and go to bed."

"event","We had a pretty good weekend, except that Chris had to go into work on Saturday, but Cassie and I went out to the playground. I changed her diaper before we left but of course right after we got to the playground she had a very poopy diaper and didn't want to go home to change it. She loved going down the slide and sending the ball we brought with us down also. She was very vocal babbling and waving and saying Hi to some kids who were watching us from their window. I finally got her to leave and to prove that we would go back I didn't take off her coat.  We went back out and stopped to talk to one of our neighbors.  Cassie spent a long time looking at her reflection in a sliding glass door that someone put out to the curb. Then we went to see if some of our neighbors were out or home who we haven't seen in a while.  They came home just when we got to their street. We played on the trike and talked.  We got to see the new baby born end of November next door to them. We played outside until Daddy got home.

Cassie and I had fun playing this morning.  Then I got to take a nap and Daddy & Cassie played. My parent's took us out to dinner to the Cheesecake Factory, yummy, for Chris' birthday. Of course my sister heard we were going so she wanted to join us. We used to all go out for birthdays, but it started to get to be too much for all of us to go. My niece and nephew don't do well at restaurants(pickey eaters and don't sit still). I thought that it would be my nephew being jealous of Cassie doing something with Nana and Papa and he wasn't. We sat at table next to each other and my niece and nephew wanted to sit with us. The wait would have been 3 hrs for party of 9 so we split between 2 tables. So they kept going back and forth between the tables.  Cassie behaved herself until they left and she wanted to go too. That started her melt down. We left as quickly as we could.  

We played with Cassie when we got home and she pushed me down on the floor and then tried to drag me across the floor laughing the whole time. Chris was trying to get her to climb or do something to him.  She would go over and I would move back close to them.  She would come back and grab my shirt and try to drag me again.  Pulling my shirt and my hair.  It was so funny. She is so cute!  So over all it was a great weekend."

"event","Friday we went to giant so I could get Cassie milk which we were out of. Cassie wanted everything so I decide I would see if we could join the cookie club.  The lady said I just had to come up and ask for a cookie they weren't doing the cards anymore. She gave me a bright red cookie that looked like a flower. I wanted to ask for just a sugar cookie, but I didn't know if I could be picky.  Well I should have been.  Cassie enjoyed it, but it was very messy.  She had red all over and towards the end she was breaking it into pieces. (I didn't realize she was dropping the pieces all over the store...sorry giant)  We got home and went for a walk to the playground.  Cassie didn't mind getting a little wet from the mist on everything.  She loved the tire swing, slide, horsey, and climbing up the ladder to the pole. (Our playground is very old and outdated. It needs to be upgraded for safety.)  She had fun.  Trying to enjoy the semi nice weather before it got too cold. We came in and I made her dinner.  She really didn't eat much. I took her up for her bath which she enjoyed and requested. She goes up the stairs and normally goes to her door and knocks on it.  All the upstairs doors are closed so the cats can't get in.  We turn on the lights in her room to start heating it up a little.  Then she grabs her towel from the bar and tries to open her door.  So we had a bath. Chris got her bath crayons which she loves, but then doesn't want to get out of the tub.  I gave her bubbles to distract her and hid the crayons.  She loves bubbles.  I got her dressed and sat down with her bottle and stories. Normally she finishes the bottle, but she only drank half.  I put her in the crib and she coughed a couple of times, but then settled down. 

I started to clean the kitchen, but decided to start the video monitor on my computer since she wasn't acting herself. I sat down to start the video and Chris called.  Cassie started coughing and then threw up.  Boy am I glad I was watching the video because we do the cry it out system so normally I wouldn't have gone to her.  I saw her throw up twice and start crying. (This was her first throw up in 1 1/2 yrs since she used to spit up every once in awhile with formula which I am thankful since I get sick easy.)  I told Chris that she threw up and I needed to go get her.  I got her out of the crib and stripped her. I brought her downstairs to calm her down and wait for Chris to get home. Chris held her while I cleaned up her crib and changed the sheets, blanket, and teddy. It was the cookie. Bright red and stinky.  Now I know to ask for a different cookie if they give her something so food colored.  I am definitely going to be more careful when giving her things with food coloring. 

She slept the rest of the night and was fine.  I was careful with what I gave her the next morning because I didn't know for sure if it was the cookie or what Chris had earlier in the week. She was fine. Since we weren't sure we missed a playgroup with our first playgroup/hospital support group, but only 4 people went. It was better to be safe and we would have been late because Cassie was still sleeping at the start. We are going to try and reschedule for another weekend.

I need to find more things Cassie likes to eat. It is getting hard to find meals for her. She is getting better at eating meat and chicken sometimes. I will stop rambling now."

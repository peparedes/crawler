christmas shopping trip with Alex &amp; Lauren. Who do you hate Lauren?
BRIAN DENNY?!?!?! heh. we're weird. we also hate his bandmates. <br>
HFS Highlights:<br>
-I didn't die.<br>
-Mikey had fun after Breaking Benjamin left. They were horrible. No stage presence what-so-ever.<br>
-Chevelle! omg, me and sam rocked so hard, man. as lame as it sounds, we rocked out with our socks out.<br>
-Crowd surfing is so much fun. i thought i was going to die but i
didnt. Jehan and Chris lifted me up once or twice and threw me onto the
crowd. It was very invigorating.<br>
- Mosh pits are stupid, pointless,and scary.<br>
-Franz Ferdinand and The Killers were superb! The lead singer of the Killers seemed like a bit of an ass. Eh, he's hot, it's ok.<br>
-Lead singer of Franz is hothothot!!!<br>
-We met these 2 kids, Melanie and Paul. Melanie was the ideal girl for
Jehan. Cute, witty, beautiful, and just....perfect. We didnt know how
old she was. She was 15. He was soooo sad. She looked like 18. Her
brother was 16 and very hot, but J was really down in the dumps today.
He said if she were older, he would easily be able to fall in love with
someone like that. We forgot to get their phone numbers, too. A
terrible thing. I feel really bad for him.<br>
-Good Charlotte is the worst band to ever be created. ewwwww. they were
horrible. Chris hit the lead singer with a piece of ice and J hit the
bassist. ahahah.<br>
- Jimmy Eat World and My Chemical Romance were pretty good, as well. We
missed Keane. I kinda wanted to hear them/him/it/whatever.<br>
-The epitome of good music = Velevet Revolver. Boy can ole Scottie wiggle it!<br>
- My ass got grabbed so many times when we were crowd surfing. heh heh<br>
-Me and Sam both almost hit Chris in the face with our butts. He looked
up and thought ""hey! i know those asses!"". Silly Chris. (Chris &amp;
Sam 12-4-04)<br>
-I had a spec-freaking-tacular night and i plan on going to HFS this summer. <br>
<br>

She basically blames Ann for the whole thing just becasue she brought it. Even though there was only a little bit of&nbsp; liquid in the bottle, we got in a bit of trouble. I'm just not allowed to go on AIM until Thursday. My mom had trusted Sam more than Ann because she barely knew Ann and now she wants Sam to prove that she can be trusted again. Sam has built up alot of respect for my mom. This is definitely a good thing, I think.&nbsp; Well I have to go, but leave me a reassuring message if possible. More later.</P>

I got sort of emotional because today i found out that my aunt ann has uterin cancer. not kewl. but my tears soon left since he asked me out, officially. we went to take Alix (Sam's sister)&nbsp;and Chris (DeHanas) to MBP from the mall. After that, we went to petsmart and got Chris' baby sharks and his paycheck. we got it cashed, got some burger king and rented a movie. we went to go and get ""Taking Lives"" with Angelina Jolie cus sam says the sex scene was realllllly hot. lmao. But, yeah....we totally picked up the wrong movie. we got ""Taking Sides"". Damn the Blockbuster!!!! ahahaha. Well...we just parted and then Sam/Chris went to his room adn made outand me and mikey just stayed and hung out downstairs. we watched the tribute concert to Ray Charles. It was beautiful. We just talked for a while...heh heh....;-). he told me i was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. i wanted to AWWWWWWW, but i refrained. it was the best evening i have had in a long time. i have not felt that safe with someone so fast in my life. i know he is never going to hurt me. Alix hit her lip on chris' tooth and her lip bled on the way home when sam had to stop and since it was manual and she sucks at driving manuals, it burned rubber and made alix's head fly at chris' while they were kissing. SOOOOOOOOOOOO funny. Sam and Chris are so sweet and passionate and lovely. i hope she stays happy with him. i still love our double dating (real dating) loveliness. *romantic sigh thing*</P>

<P>There were TONS of sexy guys there but the one at the Pizza De Napoli was uber super hot. I gave beth two dollars to go over and start talking to him.

I want a boyfriend. I really do. I want someone i can rely on and talk to about anything. And to kiss. Kissing is fun. </P>
<P>Anyways back to the Renn Fest...Kiefer walked around with Angela for a while...he likes her...how weird/bad/icky/oy vay. We saw him a few times..nothing special. Me, Beth and Kim were eventually the only ones left and we met up with J (my brother) my mom, and my dad. The old folks went home and J walked around with us. We found Amanda Hile and she came along with us and we went to ride the elephants while J and Kim went to get food. Kim hit on my brother so fucking much. lol. it was hilarious. She kept poking his nipple rings. He felt rather insecure, i think. The line was too long to ride the elephants so we called J and found him and Kim again. Beth described him as looking good in his ""emo hotness"" ahahaha. he does look emo now. his hair is uber short and he has geek glasses and gauged ears. mine are gauged but i don't look nearly as emo as him. lol. </P>
<P>I was sporting an ultra sexy hair wreath, mind you. ULTRA SEXY!!! But yes, i tried on a corset and put it on backwards. god damn it was so funny. After all this, J went back with Donna and Sean and some other people and we smuggled fries on the bus. Beth stole 2 hair garland things; it was great fun. I'll post about the bus rides later. Oh jeez. </P>
<P>leave me one if you aren't a <FONT color=#009900>backstabbing cunt</FONT>!!!&nbsp;</P>"

"event","<P>Just got back from Tech Day. It's always boring but today we were working on barking for our ""trees"" lol. They always look funny. oh well. But CJ gave me a ride home which was nice and fun....not. just a short quiet ride home. It was amazing that he didnt kill me. And last night i went to MBP. </P>
<P>I met this guy with a really long black trenchcoat. super uber hot.&nbsp;he gave me some <FONT color=#cc33cc>trix</FONT> <FONT color=#ff6666>cereal</FONT>. mmmm trix. silly me. but yes. he went over to Kima's and talked her through a bad time after torturing her and I at MBP. i gave him my #...supposedly <FONT color=#999999>he's going to call</FONT>. oh, and here's a picture of maddie and my shoes. its looks like the same person with different pants standing on the opposite sides of the camera at the same time. hella kool. Maddie is a sweetheart. so is beth. I hope the shit with beth and christine cools down soon. but it was an ok day, and now i must shower and go see the play ""Meshuga Nuns"". Tomorrow I am going to the Rennaissance Festival with my Advanced Acting class. lovely, i say. </P>
<P>For Alex #1 I got a new LJ user picture...kim must hate it...hence the <FONT color=#009900>something corporate</FONT> reference. oh well. don't really care. :-) u know i luv you, Kim, in a nonlesbian way, of course.</P>

I've gotten pissed at everyone for no reason alot this week. I'm not even PMSing! god. im weird anyways, I'm going to go to MBP for the first time in like 2 months, tonight. That should be interesting. Maybe i'll meet someone. a beautiful someone. someone that makes me happier than my current state.

"event","im going to try that whole 2-4-6-8 thing....

so i decided to keep a journal about it and about my progress

i really wish i had a scale in my house that would make everything soo much easier.
but since i dont i guess im going to have to play it by ear and just notice if i loose any weight..

todays my first day so wish me luck... i can only have 44 cals for dinner cause i already had 140 by 12:30 wich isnt bad considering the days half over and a cup of spinach is only like 10 so i know ill be fine :]"

"event","i hate this its always something....

i remember back when i was younger i was so skinny. i dont undstand how it all changed.

my boyfriend is anorexic i suppose that doesnt really help me. but i hate my self.

all summer i havent worn a bathing suit once because i dont want anyone to see what i have to see when i put it on. 

im gross some people are ment to be thin and others are ment to be fat and they look good fat.. but not me im supposed to be thin not in the middle. 5'4'' and 113 is not a normal thing. 

im so glad i no longer have p.e. i dont have to swim in front of people anymore or be the only person with a t shirt on to hide my massive hips. i hate my hips. theyre huge. and i cant do anything about it."

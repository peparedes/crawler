"event","andrea is sleeping on my bed next to me and i don't care how many times i've said it before, but she is the most beautiful girl ever when she sleeps...or when she's awake...i thought she started talking to me but she was talking in her sleep...couldn't quite tell what she said, something about get out of my way or something...lol...quite funny
i work tuesday,wednesday,thursday, and saturday...and thursday is the lucky day i finally get that tube taken out...i'm going to be in so much pain though, i hope they refill my prescription a few times in the near future cuz i am seriously getting immune to painkillers...i went a day without them hoping they would work the next, and even with taking twice the usual amount i take at one time 3x2=6, i didn't feel any of the pain decrease, i'm seriously starting to believe that pot is the only thing that helps a great deal..ah well what the fuck am i supposed to do?
the next thing is morphine or demarol and i don't quite believe i could get a rx for them...i especially don't like sticking needles into myself, i'd have to get my honey to do it...alright it's going on 1:30 so i think i'll cuddle up to my honey for a little while before i have to take her home...
peace out"

"event","so i'm sitting here at my computer and my stomach is
fucking hurting really badly...i kinda woke up a little early cuz my honey
kept making noises and it eventually brought me out of my wonderful
slumber...and usually when i wake up, that's it i'm up for good....
and now i have to deal with all this pain. not fun.
i'm sad for my honey cuz her sister and her dad went to the dog
show without her...i feel the need to take her out to do something else
but it's sucks when you don't have any money and your car's a piece of shit
that can't go past 40 mph or it starts shaking uncontrollably...so i have to
think of something to do around here that she would like...
and the weather sucks and it's supposed to suck  until like wednesday
and thursday, but then it's supposed to rain...so i can't really plan out any
outside activities too much...i took andrea to the spillway to watch the
sun set but we were to cold to stay the whole time...which sucks cuz i thought
that would be great to watch a blazing orange and red sunset with barely any
clouds in the way...oh well, we'll just wait for a better day to do it...
now that my honey wants to start doing stuff more often i do, it just sucks cuz
of the reasons i stated earlier....my car, money and the weather....but i'll
try to figure out something in the meantime...and also it makes me uncomfortable
and unmotivated when my stomach hurts, especially when nothing helps the pain...
i dunno i'm gonna continue to think about this stuff and i guess start my day...
peace out"

"event","so i'm sitting in my room watching married with children...

i just recently had ""surgery"" as the doctors called it....but the operation
was called a sostycopy(something like that) they stuck a camera ona long tube
up my urethra, through my bladder and up to my left kidney...they took specific
pictures and x-rays to figure out exactly what they need to do about it...they
thought that yesterday might be the last day i have these problems if everything
went great...but it didn't...my doctor wanted to stick a small pin into my calceal
diverticulum sac, which holds wastes and calcium diposits, to get to the kidney
stone that's inside it, and hopefully in the end lasering it into small pieces so
i could pass it through a stint...and even though they couldn't do that, they put a stint in me anyways...(a stent or a stint)....and that's a tube that runs from the
penis up through the bladder into the kidneys, and i guess it's supposed to protect
me from infections as the blood passes through my urine...and let me tell you it's
the worst pain i've ever felt when i have to urinate...it hurts worse than when i
had to go to the emergency room....so it's definitely hard to take when i have to go....mostly blood comes out and it never feels like i'm done but i just have to stop at certain points when it hurts too much...so i put a ice pack on it and take a bunch of pain killers and just hope it feels better everytime it happens.
i guess the next step is to cute a hole in my back to get to my kidney to try to take out the sac and kidney stone, which actually is kind of a blood clot as well, so i just hope they don't fuck up cuz i guess i could die or something (from what they're telling me) 
besides that stuff my kidney does hurt constantly, as well as the whole left side of my abdomen and pancreas....and lately i've been having worse migraines than i usually have...so anyways i'm just in a lot of pain all the time and it's so much fun!!!

my girlfriend got me a job at burger king and i'm just so relieved that at least i'll have something...i've been looking for a job for so long i'll take anything i can get...and i'm just so grateful that my honey did that for me, i just hope i don't fuck up too much...as long as they put me in the kitchen i think i'll be fine...it's just if they put me on drive thru or front cash i seriously don't know if i'll be able to handle it...like i think i might try to choke someone over the counter or through the window if they give me any shit...and then i'll get fired and my honey might be held responsible for that so i just hope it doesn't come to that...even though i won't be making much money, i'm hoping to get a second job delivering newspapers in the morning or something...i need to get some car insurance, pay off my debt with my dad, save money, buy a new car, go to school and buy everything i possibly can for my girlfriend...cuz she deserves the whole world
and i'm gonna try my hardest to make that happen....
anyways, i guess i have quite a busy time ahead of me, and i just hope everything will work out for the best...i hope everyone's doin alright out there...be grateful for your health...

"event","i always wonder when, how, and even where i ever went wrong... 
to sum up my life in two words subtracted by andrea, you would have
the expression called a ""fuck up"". i constantly fuck up just about
everything i do all the time....for example, how i'm in debt and
everytime i've been given odd decent amounts of money...instead of
saving it i would always spend it...either on myself or the people around
me...i didn't even pay for my fucking car insurance cuz i didn't know
and when i found out i had already spent the 550 dollars my dad gave
me for christmas or whatever...my point is i always fuck up with money.
i had a decent job at sveden house making tons of money that i didn't
even need then that i would defininetly need now, but i quit that job,
twice, because they were making me work 50 to 60 hours a week during 
school....and now i can't even find one single job and now i have to
go to the fucking employment agencies to get a temporary job...always
because i fuck up with keeping jobs or stuff of that nature...
i have all these medical problems like the calyceal diverticulum in
my kidney (a small sac that retains bodily wastes that are normally
excreted through the urine), and inside that i have a kidney stone
that seems to be getting larger by the week...and how soon i'll need
to have surgery to avoid losing my kidney....how these things could
have been taken care of earlier, like a year ago when they first happened,
if i could have just made an extra effort into getting tests done sooner
and quicker, and actually had the money for it, i might not be as sick as
i am today...i could be healthy today, not in debt, have a good paying job,
be saving money, spending money on andrea, helping my dad more, not in
constant pain, not taking pain killers, not smoking so much weed(for the pain),
and just have some assurance in what i'm doing, where i'm going and how
i'm doing it....and for all that i am a fuck up...cuz i fucked it all up
way too early...i should have listened a little better and got stuff done
quicker...i don't know, but just all that, and all the effect it has on me,
makes me extremely depressed...i think of all the good times i had, right
during the same time i was fucking myself over for the future...that's why
i hate bringing up the past and thinking about it, you can think of some
really great memories, but if you look hard enough and think about it hard
enough, sometimes you may have been just fucking yourself over
i am a fuck up
do yourself a favor...(don't be like me)"

when we've been together for most of the day
and when it's time to finally say goodnight or
goodbye why is it always so hard to do so?
when i don't receive a phone call from you
i get so sad and worried that something could
have happened to you...and i need to get to the
bottom of it right away...
i can't understand why i'm nothing without you
but then i always know the reason why...
because your everything and anything to me...
your my whole life...and when you say things that
make me look bad or things that make me sad or
jealous makes me want to kill the jealousee and
kill myself afterwards...when you say or do things
that make me sad i wonder why it is and why it
happened...and when we get into arguments or
fights i always try to resolve it as quickly as
possible but it never happens that way...and that
i really don't know why....and when you do
so much for me and i do nothing for you makes me
that much more sad and upset everytime you do
something for me again...and when i always try
to do so much for you but it never really seems
like i'm getting recognition for it...like i
really feel that i did something wonderful and
nice...but then it doesn't feel that way after
i do..i don't know why....it's not like you don't
tell me that you love whatever i did for you or
it doesn't make you happy...i just don't know for
sure....i guess sometimes i really don't feel like
i'm quite enough...but i really try to be...
and i don't understand why you would actually want
some guy to dance almost completely naked all over
you...and it's not even me....and when you say so
many other people are cute and handsome and hot,
it makes me feel like i'm just another one of those
people, and not myself, a perfect counterpart and
soulmate for you...and i love how i look at other
girls and women and i never think that their actually
pretty or attractive...and i never look at them like
i used to before i met you....and i love how i love
everything about you, mentally and physically, and
just about every thing you do(except for the 
things that make me sad) and how i would never ever
find someone as wonderful and beautiful and so
right for me as you....and how i would kill myself
if i had to live without you....and how you always 
make me happy even if it doesn't seem like i am
or when i am depressed...no matter how sad or
depressed i get you still make me happier than
anything....and your the only thing that makes me
happy one bit and stays that way....and i especially
love how you love me and i love you...and how we're
soulmates and we're spending the rest of our lives
together....with all these wonderful reasons i love
you and i always want to be with you...it gives me
the perfect reasons to be jealous or sad about
certain things you do....and when i totally erased
my past before you and regret everything i did that didn't
involve you...and i just wish that you could understand
that and put away those feelings that make you sad
about what i did in the past...because if you think
about it...i wasn't with you then, and now i am and
look how much better of a person you made me into...
that should make everything turn into a clean slate
up until when we first got together....
and i really hate how i make you upset and sad at
times...and i just want to do everything in my power
to make it better...and since i'm totally honest
in that and all that i've said...it should be known
that we both should know that i would never ever want
to make you sad or upset, no matter how sad or upset
you made me....and i think maybe i should just stop
writing before i start making no sense at all
i love you honey...and no one or anything will take
that away from us...not even death...."

"event","In my opinion, I believe that the u.s. and the people in it would
do a lot better if we were all libertarian, or at least if the
government was. For all those who do not know what libertarianism
is, please see note at bottom. In my case, the reason I would
want this most would be because it would be legal to smoke weed and
sell it and all that stuff. I use medicinal marijuana for my medical 
problems and feel that it really does help with pain and certain disorders,
because I know from experience. So, if drugs were sold legally, there 
would be no fear of being arrested; for those drug or medicinal 
drug users out there, this would be heaven. And all those that
never wanted anything to do with drugs in the beginning could stay
that way....because you can't infringe on anyone else's rights, which
means you would actually have to ask permission before say, smoking 
a joint or shooting up in front of them. So it wouldn't necessarily
make more people do drugs, I know plenty of people that have tried
drugs and never wanted to do them again just because it wasn't for them
and it wasn't their thing. You could do anything you wanted to inside your
home and your property, and only have to obey the rights of other people and 
other establishments. 

And drugs are not the only thing that would be effected either, there are many
others that would take months to write about so I'll just give my regards
to my second reason I would want this; If anarchy shall never befall
the u.s. I think that libertarianism would be the next best thing
because of the such limited use of government. The only thing we would 
need the government for was to serve and protect us with the same law
officials we have now, but with greatly changed agendas. They could only
arrest or put away someone if that someone infringed on someone else's
rights. 

Well anyways, it's nice to dream.

NOTE;
Libertarianism is a political philosophy which advocates individual rights and a limited government. Libertarians believe individuals should be free to do anything they want, so long as they do not infringe upon the equal rights of others. They further believe that the only legitimate use of force, whether public or private, is to protect those rights. For libertarians, there are no 'positive rights' (such as to food or shelter or health care), only 'negative rights' (such as to not be assaulted, abused, robbed or censored). On the Nolan Chart, libertarianism rests in the upper right quadrant, or that of high economic freedom and high personal freedom.

i wished i'd dream

i want bliss or do i really
i'm sad or am i really

i feel alive
but dead in my mind

i need peace
then why do i fight

i fear never being enough
and i'm not quite

i seem to disgust myself
without doing a thing


restless, awake, tired, sad, 
emotional, numb, happy, dead, alive,
angered, gleeful, peaceful, 
there's too many ideas and 
thoughts running through my mind

sometimes i wish i couldn't think
maybe i'd be better off as a vegetable


i wish i could die just knowing that
you love me,
some amazing creature brought forth
upon this desolate earth,
seemingly all too beautiful to ever
love someone such as myself
and it always makes me wonder

how did i become the lucky one?

and that reminds me,
i miss you so much right now"

Greed of gain is wrong

ear to the ground,
eye to the sky,
waiting for seasons to come,
leaves changing and falling,
snow flakes glistening off 
tree branches,
the warm breezes blowing during 
spring thunderstorms,
and the little bugs that light up
in far away hay fields,

where the deer prance and play,
snorting at bull frogs crossing 
the land back to their pond,

and the dream once had 
of total inheritance in peace;
haunts the evil world at it's

and i really don't know why...maybe typing about stupid shit will make me feel better or something i don't quite know...
the past week and a half or so i've been sick off and on...my baby and i were taking comtrex and man is that shit good!! i started becoming immuned to it so i just stopped taking it all together...now when i feel up to going back to work my boss is going to lansing or somewhere to watch his son play hockey...so now i have the whole weekend off...i should be happy but i'm not cuz i really need the money, 
with christmas and my girlfriend and I's anniversary coming up and all...
and i have to pay a stupid parking ticket on monday...that fucking mother fucking cop couldn't even knock on the front door and tell me to move my truck off the front lawn cuz he's a stupid asshole...
i think i should buff up and become a bodyguard...i always wanted to be a professional hitman but it looks like i can't do that now...there's just something about killing people for money i dunno what it is...
i'm quite bored right now but i think i'm going to play some gta3 to calm my nerves a little...
my fucking steering gear broke off the other day and fell forward while i was driving, i was just lucky that i was turning in a parking lot cuz if i was out in traffic, i would have been fucked...i had to get it towed back to the house we're working on and my boss helped me fix it, but of course it's still fucked up...i think i should probably check it out a little today....
so new years coming up...wooooo...i'm just excited to get drunk and shoot off fireworks...and then go over my honeys' house and party and what not...
i hope people will be considerate when partying over her house...by cleaning up their shit and what not....
we got new windows on our house and we'll be painting and getting new carpet soon also, so i guess that's sort of cool....
there's a lot of people i'd like to kill in the world...
ummmm

So today was a long fucking day. I'm tired and I'm gonna fucking sleep
even if I have to take a bunch of sedatives! For fuck sake I need to
relax for a little while. I need to rest my head on something and sleep
away my life. I feel buried. Work seemed to take forever and my stomach
hurt the whole fucking time. I have to clean the doctor's office later
too and that sucks ass. 
- I need more money
- I need to sleep
- I need another job
- I want to be stoned
- I kinda am
- But I can get more
  stoned
- I'm done
- Maybe I'm done
  forever.
- Just maybe.

Since I have my credit back now, I need to make sure I
graduate and shit. Then I need to go to a good trade
school and find an apprenticeship job. But I need money
to do this, and my only one job at Hodell's isn't bringing
enough doe to my hands....so i don't know what I'm supposed
to do. I need a second job, I need to get out of debt, I need
a lot of money, and most of all, I need to straighten my life
out a great deal. So, I'm sure most ev'ry body that's gradutin'
feelin' like this, huh bubba? 
I dunno but when shit happens, it better be some good GRADE A 
shit were talkin about.
Yeah, so when life doesn't suck for a second,
let me know so I can put a smile on my face,
and laugh and act like a fool.
I want to go back to being a toys r' us kid...
So I don't have to deal with life right now.
I wanna take a break but I ain't got no
time left...so what to do?
I wish I could stop time and go rob
a bank and get away scott free..
and not have to worry about anything.
And I wanna say ""Fuck off!"" to everything,
and ""let me be""."

Last night was crazy. My computer wouldn't load up for awhile, so I had to have a technician talk to me and tell me how to delete my whole operating system (os)
!!!!! So I had to start all over like when you first get it from the factory. It's a brand new computer now and it didn't cost a cent!! I'm fucking happy cuz I had like 32.000 files on Kazaa and I couldn't delete them. So fuck yeah!!!! And it's running all fast too and I have all my memory back. Yup. So that's all that really happened lately. I seen a donkey takin' a wiss on the side of the road today around Blossom Heath. It was funny...I thought it was fake but I looked at it more closely and his leg was slightly lifted and it was just pissing. Yeah. Now I'm sitting here debating what to do next cuz there's so much shit I can do now. And my baby is looking all cute lying next to me. We've got into a lot of arguments lately, but I still love her more than ever!
Here as she sits next to me getting mad because I won't come cuddle with her, I see the rest of my life and how it's going to be. And as long as she's in it, it will be perfect."

"event","A dream shattered with one breath. Tell what
it was that one night that snuck up on you
in the dark. Does your mind play tricks on you?
Do you see things that normally shouldn't be
there? Does the pain ever go away? Can you see
the dark side? Follow me into your eternal
destiny. Continue the journey by stepping through
the cellar door into an unknown, unholy place.
Where bloody corpses are scattered among every 
wall and evil instinct controls the minds of
the people that should so mis-unfortunately walk
through the passageway between light and dark.
Chose the dark and follow closer still. Follow me
through the vines that strangle on cue, when they
sense the presence of living flesh. Stay to the 
right where they can't reach you. You'll be safe with 
me. Take care while leaving your old life behind and
take glory in the new horrific person you've turned
into. Kill everything that moves. The voices won't
stop until I do. Killed 22 nuns and a priest on
lunch break. Suprised by how much of that religious
bacteria I could hold down without throwing it back up.
Nothing like eating ""The Last dinner"". I'm satisfied
anyways. I don't believe those holy rollers have
anything to say, as are they now my stool specimen.
I'll do what I want, when I want.
I'll kill you now,
I'll kill you later.
She's kinda nice,
Tho I hate 'er.
I'll rip out her eyes
And piss in the hollow 
crevice's."

"event","yeah so the weekend was alright...went and seen a stupid movie with my honeyyyy.....saturday went out to her sisters
and i drank too fast...so fuck my fucking pills - you don't
let me act like my regular self. did some other stuff....and
now it's our anniversary cuz it's past twelve o'clock. i fell
asleep earlier and just now woke up....and i gotta figure out
some way to teach my girlfriend how to call my house...i never
thought it could be this hard?!? i dunno. and i gotta teach her how to drive...maybe not soon...but soon enough...maybe when you get back from jamaica honey....
so many things i've meant to do...so many things i haven't done...so many things i don't wanna do...so where should i start? i remember i wrote a really fucking long journal in here like a week ago and it erased when i tried to save it.
fucks that? i spent an hour writing down everything to have it just drift away....maybe it was better that way....but i
won't fucking know now will i? i wanna see my grrrl right now. i'm thinking about breaking in her house just to see her.
but her dogs will probably attack me...not that i care about that...easy price to pay....i just have respect for the other people there that are most likely sleeping. so now i have nothing to do for quite awhile becuz i can't fall back asleep.
i guess i'll play gta3 until i get drowsy again...and by that time it will be time to get ready for stupid fucking school.
i'm so glad we have a short week and allll that time off.
i lost credit in one of my classes...so now i have to appeal it. and if i don't get it back...looks like i won't be graduating anytime soon. so fuck alll that i'm out."

"event","i came upon a midsummer night dream
where it's warm outside and there's no
snow anywhere. i but had a glance of this
and it faded under a blanket of white.
the ice shimmers off the pavement where
death can come quickly...we can survive 
only by what we know. 
succumb to the nightfall and
sleep through endless horrors,
and it still can't feed the desire
to kill at will.
clouds fill the skies 
the moon provides the light
but still nothing makes it
seem right. 
devastated,
disturbed,
crazed,
despondent.
mellow days don't feel real.
nothing feels real."

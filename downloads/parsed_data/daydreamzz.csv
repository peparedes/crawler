"event","As you can see, i changed the look of my livejournal. Like the new style?? of course you do. well nothing interesting going on 2day. i'm in study...it's last period...i wanna go home. I have a game at SHA 2night and i don't feel like going. I STILL have to finish that stupid book huck finn. but at least we don't have to write an essay on it any more. I know you're probably sick of hearing about my partay but i don't care...my list keeps getting longer and longer but i can't take that many people. and i want at least one guy my age to come but it would help if i actually knew one. ok well anyway, mom keeps saying ""why don't you invite this person?"" and ""what about this person?"" She says i can only invite 7 people but she keeps telling me more people to invite. She did have a good idea to invite Kimmy (a friend of the family who is exactly 6 months younger than me). I thought that was cool. So now my list consists of Anto, Reese, Laura, maybe Kate, maybe Amanda, kimmy, and some other people that i'm not sure of yet ,and of course my family. Oh well, i have lots of time to think about it since i want to go in the summer when we won't be freezing to death. Oh yeah and for places to go when we are there, i scratched off the museum from the list cause mom said it was too expensive and that it would be boring. Times Square is definitly on my list cause that place is soooo cool at night and that is where Planet Hollywood is. Central park is also nice but mom and dad said no carriage rides cause they are too expensive. Dude, it's MY 16TH BIRTHDAY...what they can't spare some money!! it's like they want to get off cheap or something. I mean if i wanted a car for my birthday, which i don't, that would cost way more. I don't see the point of getting a car for your 16th cause you can't even drive it for like a year, and that's if you pass the test. 
Yesterday was soooo depressing. I went home, locked myself in my room, played some music, and cried. No one even noticed i was gone. I don't know why i was so sad, but i haven't cried in a while so maybe i was due or something. Everytime i have plans for the weekend, something always has to screw them up. Like this weekend, i wanted to do something with my friends or go over jen's or WHATEVER...i just wanna get out of the house...but no...we gotta do something saturday and sunday is like a special mass thingy at church or something. Oh yeah... my mom informed me this morning that i probably won't be going back to SHA next year. The tuition is more than $8000 next year!!! we had a hard enough time this year trying to manage all of our money and have enough for me to go to school and tuition this year isn't even near $8000. I mean i don't really like SHA, but i'm comfortable here. Almost everyone here bitches about how much SHA sucks. We'll it's not that bad. It's not great either but oh well. gtg bye"

Anyway...yeah i stayed home from school today...what a major mistake!!! but it's not my fault the car didn't start...yeah well, i have to finish the book for english and do the questions - not fun. but i am glad that the computer is working. this weekend it kept freezing and we'd have to turn it off and stuff. And i've been researching my b-day partay still...i think i'm gonna stick with planet Hollywood. but i don't know what we're gonna do when in NYC. Museum? Shopping? Eating? Central park? i have no idea, but it's a while away anyway. But i'm not sure if i mentioned this before but i am going to ocean city this summer!!! i'm sooo excited.. i can't wait for the boardwalk...the amusement parks...the go-karts...the beaches and pools...the Club...the shopping!!! Oh, i'm ecstatic!! and we're going with some family friends that have kids around my age so we can roam the city by ourselves. I wanted to bring a friend but we already made reservations.

"event","ok... my title for this entry has absolutely nothing to do with what i'm writing...i'm in a random mood. Today at lunch must have been the hardest i've laughed in a long time. i'm supposed to be reading the rest of huckleberry finn (i'm on chapter 9 out of like 36 chapters...oh and it's supposed to be done by 2morrow)but i really don't feel like reading. i hat being forced to read stuff. i like reading my own stuff on my own time when I feel like it. EWWW...i had wendy's tonight. i'm not normally picky about what i eat but this stuff was icky. it tasted really funky...ewwww. watch, now i'm gonna get food poisoning and die. so-long cruel world....and on my gravestone it will read ""here lies the body of the beloved Binx...yeah, that girl."" - so poetic isn't it. Randomness...lately i've noticed that i am much more observant. Like in spiderman 2, i noticed that 1- there is way too much screaming and 2- in the scene on the train, the lady holding the baby is holding a purple blanket then when that camera flashes back to her, she is holding a gray blanket then a purple one again. (you're thinking ""who really cares?"" right?)i've noticed other stuff too lately. i'm just weird and random like that. gtg. I <3 U."

"event","Today does not feel like friday. I only went to school for 2 days this week. Midtermz next week...that sucks. but 2morrow i'm going over jen's house. i'm really excited about that. i'm starting to plan my b-day in NYC. I hope it actually happens. Watch... i'll probablly have this whole thing planned and it will never happen. That will suck.
lately, with it being all depressing outside and stuff, i've been thinking about summer vaction. I wanna go to a nice warm beach soooo bad. Last year we went to Disney and Universal. that was cool and all but i'm a beach girl. I need the sun's rays and the rolling waves. The year before Disney we went to Wildwood. That was fun cause we went with another family that had kids me mike and kate's age. It was cool but i miss Ocean City in Maryland. I love our hotel and the boardwalk and EVERYTHING!!! i love the shops, the amusement parks, the go-kart racing, the days spent pool-side, the days spent soaking up the sun on the beach. I love the boogie-baording, and watching the dolphins jump out of the water early in the morning. I love having something to do but having nothing that i HAVE to do...if that makes sense. I love going out to dinner every night. I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT!!!!i wanna go to ocean city soooo bad. It would be sooo cool if i could bring my friends there in the summer...i have always wanted to do that. but i doubt my mom and dad would ever let that happen becausethen mike and kate will beg to have their friends go.
that's all i have to write for now....<3"

"event","Today was ok. I went to school, had a chemistry test, and it went by pretty fast. But then after school i had cheerleading. that was ok too except my left base hurt her wrist. other than that, it was fine. But then, after practice, was when i was left alone..... At first my mom wasn't able to pick me up so i asked reese if she could. But then My mom's plans changed and she could pick me up. So after practice, reese left, and i turned on my phone to find a missed call. When i checked my voice mail i found out that reese was supposed to take me home because her mom called my mom and worked everything out. Well it was too late. i tried calling reese's cell and her house but i couldn't get in touch with her. She left me. It wasn't her fault but i was mad and alone.Age offered for me to go over her house but i said that i would be ok. Eventually mom came and picked me up - an hour after practice! I was ssooo cold and everyone left already. And the doors to the gym were closed!!! i was, like, almost crying. oh well, next time some one else is gonna pick me up, i'm gonna make sure the plans are clear.

"event","This weekend went by soooo fast. Friday, i went over reese's house right after school. after that we went for a walk around milford which was really cool. we saw 2 waterfalls that were so pretty. and we also got attacked by geese....THAT WAS SOOO SCARY. then we went to the mall to get emma a gift. there we met tommy and i saw anto. i haven't seen either of them in such a long time. then we went to the party (if u can even call it that)...it was soooo boring. i would of had more fun staring at a toaster for 4 hours! there was some weird people there, and i have a feeling certain ""friends"" of mine think i'm a loser. i mean...i know i'm not the greatest or smartest person in the world but i know when someone is being sarcastic towards me. oh well, i'll just try to be nice to them. i hate that about me...if some one is mean to me i do nothing about it. i burry it deep within me and the only thing i can do is be ""nice"". i need like the 411 on how to be bitchy. oh well... getting back to the story...after the ""party"" we went back to reese's house and chilled. that was like the best part of the whole night. then the next day ihad to wake up early and go the jenny's house. i went to her spanish class and we were like an hour late...but it was no biggy. then we went shopping the rest of the day. we were on a quest for the ultimate wreath and fake christmas tree. we ended up getting the wreath but we also got this sorry looking tree. it looks like a stick with green pipe cleaners attached. but alls it needs is a little love (and an extreme make-over). then the next day (today) i came back home and now i'm writting this. at 3:30 i have to go to my brother's basketball game. yep... that's about it. ttyl"

My confirmation is monday night. i'm not nervouse or excited cause i really don't know what to expect. Saturday is reese's partay. i'm excited bout that. i don't know how many people she invited or who, but i hope i know other people there cause if i don't, then i'll feel really uncomfortable. yeah.....um....in other news i got sls cheerleading monday after school, and got off from cheerleading for 2 week for ND. i hope the girls at sls don't suck again this year. Like, most of them knew what to do, it was just the timing in the cheers and the sharpness, not to mention the fact that none of them wanted to be there. we had girls coming late, girls leaving early, some not showing up to practices, some not showing up for games, some not showing up for anything, some complaining that they didn't want to do half-time. O and the classic fights about who is calling who what. It was really annoying last year. This year hopefully it will be better. 
I also got my report card yesterday. i was nervous cause i knew i didn't do as well as i could have this quarter, but my gpa wasn't that bad. i got a 3.86. i was soooo glad cause it is still considered high honors. YEAH. yup...gtg read the scarlet letter....toodles."

only about 5 more days till HALLOWEEN!!!!BOOOOO! yeah...um....i'm going as a gothic/dead fairy/ fallen angel thingy. the costume is sort of stupid but i couldn't make up my mind this year about what i wanted to be. Friday we get to wear our costumes but mine isn't ""SHAppropriate"" so i have to buy something else to wear Friday. Sophomores also got a half day Friday which is fine except that no one else gets out early so we would either have to wait on the bus until everyone else gets out or we'll have to wait around the school forever and in our costumes too.

Because, i had to go to open house - where sha ropes in new victims and their parents, and convinces them that this school is the best in the whole wide world, but really their just interested in sucking every last cent out of their prey's over-sized pockets. But this year, for incoming freshmen, not only do they have to pay thousands of dollars, they are making them buy new laptops too. I mean sure that's cool and all but 1) it costs $2,000, and 2) I WANT A LAPTOP!!!! they sould make everyone get one except i don't want ot spend money. Other than that, i didn't do much at the open house besides eat cookies....yum. oh yeak, i did some cheerleading too. that was ok but whatever. 
ND lost yesterday, i don't know the final score but we lost. 
Nothing really exciting happened today in my life. So thats it i guess. 
much luv...

"event","THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY!!!!! wow, what a week. Yesterday at cheerleading practice, i learned how to cradle. it was all good for a while until i was thrown up and wasn't caught. One of my bases caught one side of me, but i rolled over on my other side and hit the ground. I felt bad and shocked but when i realized i was on the ground, the first thing i did was ask the other base if she was ok. Then every came over to me and ask if i was ok. I was ok but when everyone came over, i started crying. It didn't really hurt, but i was shocked. I got some ice for my shoulder, but i'm fine now. I'm a little afraid to go up again but i'll do it anyway. And this morning, the base that caught one side of me came in my homeroom to see if i was ok, and at lunch my coach ask me if i was ok too. I thought that was nice of them to ask me. 
Nothing else really exciting happened today. ND is playing Shelton (i think) tonight. i'll let u now how it goes.

"event","Mmmkay so I'm really sick of things. I'm really sick of me treating everyone like they're amazing and pretty much giving anything for them, then them not giving me anything. I'm not talking materialistic either. I could care less if I have new pants, or some shirts. What I do care about is how people treat me. I've been friends with some people since 5th grade, and they still treat me like crap. It was my friends birthday today and I love her. I had a bunch of fun, I really did. But all my other friends went all out for her, they gave her all the attention, and just did everything they could for her. But what did they do for my birthday? Nothing. We sat inside the school and ate. My best friend got me a bag of skittles and that was the biggest present I got the whole time. I wouldn't care if anyone besides her had even acknowledged that it was my birthday. And then it seems like I've been dropping friends like flies. It seems like a lot of people that I really care about, and that I thought cared about me are leaving me. I'm feeling the worst I have in a long time, and no one is there. I feel like I'm not worth having people stay around. Soo that's me. And I had to say something somewhere."

"event","<center>OK so today I really didn't feel like going to school. I had a hard day yesterday and just couldn't handle it. SO I told my mom that and she let me stay home, I just need to take care of the dog. That's what I'm doing right now. It felt really good to get some extra, much needed sleep and just kick it at home. I've just had a really relaxing day. No pressure, or stress at all. I think everyone should take a day like this off. Although I think I might be taking a few too many lately. I've got like 10 absences in my first period like 8 or 9 in my second period and like 5 or 6 in the rest. It's not really effecting my grade that much though. I just want to say that I love local bands. I love it when I find a really rockin band that is local. I've got quiet a few local bands that I like a lot more then the more famous stuff right now. Like Take the Blame, it's an all female group and they're amazing. I saw them in concert a while back and the drum blew my mind away. http://www.myspace.com/taketheblamepdx check them out. Also Pom Pom Meltdown. They're really good. http://www.myspace.com/pompommeltdown check em out too. haha I sound like a band manager trying to promote there band but I just love music, it's what keeps me going. And so I love to share music with people. My favorite by far though would have to be Swan Island. It's a group of gay women, that totally rock! The drummer is my drum instructor, and she's just wow she's an amazing drummer! They're all amazing. Again check 'em out at http://www.myspace.com/swanisland
well that's my day :]"

"event","<center> <font color=blue>Ok so since I haven't done anything with my live journal in a long time I thought I'd write something right now. I've been feeling like shit about myself for the past week. Pretty much everything that's happened so far this week has made me feel like shit. I don't feel like I'm completely worthy of all the love I get from my amazing friends, but that's there choice. So I fall in really deep like with this one girl, I know you can tell it's gonna be horrible from here on. I start to really like this girl and she starts to tell me she really likes me too. We start getting more cuddly, and a lot closer emotionally and physically. So then all of a sudden it stops. I don't see her as often, and when I do we're not as close. So I begin to feel like the second girl, the back up one, the one that she can always count on being there. Yeah makes me feel like shit. Fun, I know. So I talk to her about it today. All she says is that she cares about me a lot, she never meant to hurt me, but that since there is an age gap that she's too freaked out about nothing can ever happen. Through out this whole time I hear from people, ""So when are you guys gonna start going out? You'd be so cute together."" So I got my hopes up all high, just to be smashed again. Yeah that's how I feel. Plus with the stuff going on with my parents I feel like I'm always second. Never quiet good enough for anything. BUUTTT that's just me. How are you doing?

Kelli was my valentine and she was the bestest valentine I could ever ask for! She gave me a rose and a stuffed doggy! :] It totally made my day too. That girl is amazing and can always make me smile! Then my big sis (Cole)gave me her rainbow stud wrist band, even though it's not big it meant a lot to me. That girl looks after me no matter what and I love her more then the world. I gave Tiff this hat that I bought for her. I worked for my mom to get $30 just for her. And I spent all the money I earned to get her that hat. I wanted her to be my valentine more then anything, but I couldn't bring myself to ask her. She means the world to me, and I realize that now. Lil' T can make the worst of days seem like the best to me, and I think I might actually have to admit that I'm in love. But yeah so for valentines day I gave Tiff her hat, and then hung out over and her and Coles house with a bunch of people for a while. Even though the begining of the day wasn't the best it ended up to be the best day of my life (so far). A day isn't horrible until it's over, because there is always time for the day to get better. :]

by the light that shown soo bright.

Your the guy that any girl
would be lucky to have
and for sometime
you were mine.

When you were near
I never had a fear.
I thought you'd protect me from pain.
When in truth you were the cause for it all.

The first time we kissed,
was at a concert.
You were rocking to the band
and I thought you'd always be mine.

Pain, hate, and deseat
were your Christmas gifts to me.
I cryed untill I couldn't see
but then was the time when I truely saw
how much pain you were in.
Realizing that this was a false love
that was killing you inside.
I had to forget you,
but how could I when you were 
the first guy to love me back?

I couldn't for soo long,
forget your touch,
how badly I needed you.
But now I realize it wasn't you,
it was the love that I needed.

Indeed you broke my heart,
broke it into pieces.
But I see you needed to

 

Similes of my life

I'm like an ogre in a fairy tale,
and this fairy tale is life.
I'm like a man, that just doesn't
just doesn't wanna marry his wife.
I'm the odd one out,
the one that never fits in. <----chorus

Some people think I'm nice,
others think I eat to much rice.
Some people think I'm a slut,
but,
they got me all wrong.

I have no real friends,
no one to defend me,
against the pain that they cause,
against all the things they say.

I've been to 5 schools,
and I'm only in 8th grade.
I work a job but I barely get paid.
I've been moving since I was 7,
but sometimes I wish I was in heaven.

It's been soo hard,
not saying it was bad.
But I've grown up so much.
I don't feel like a kid.

Chorus x2

Hurt <--- Really short

Hurt is when you find the guy your in love with
but he dumps you for the girl he's in love with.

Hurt, is when you try soo hard but still get bad grades.

Hurt, is when you think someones changed when all 
they've done is disquise it.

Hurt is when you give so much love
but never get any back."

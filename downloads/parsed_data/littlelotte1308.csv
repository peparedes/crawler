"event","So I definitely have the worst luck in the world.  For those of you who haven't heard, Bobby hit my car in the parking lot after the play.  It's really not that bad, just scraped paint and one broken light, and obviously I have experience with the whole driving-while-distracted thing, and I completely forgive him, but still.  Two accidents in less than a year.  

On a lighter note, the play was fantastic, especially the second act."

"event","So this situation with my sister and her homework is getting more than a little ridiculous. I know it's really none of my business, but it just bothers me so much. I'm one of those people who never cheats. I can probably count on one hand the number of times I have ever copied my homework from someone else, and no one else has ever done my work for me. But Ariel... my mother literally sits and does her math homework at least a couple of times a week. There's a different excuse every time. Tonight, it was because she misssed two days of school and ""there's no way she could ever finish all of this homework in one night"". First of all, she's a freshman. She shouldn't have that much homework to begin with. I never had consistent homework every night until this year. Second of all, ""in one night"" means so that she can go to bed by 9:15. I haven't gone to bed that early since last school year! If she's going to take hard classes, she needs to be able to handle the workload, because ninth grade is by far the easiest year. I tell her and my mom this and they just ignore it. Today I said, ""what's she going to do in college?"" The reply to that was, ""she won't be taking classes like this in college"". We were talking about geometry. This whole thing is so against everything that I believe in and, what's more, my dad was a teacher for like 16 years and he's not doing anything about it. Sorry for boring anyone who took the time to read this, but things like this just annoy me to no end."

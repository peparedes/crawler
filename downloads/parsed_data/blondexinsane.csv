tony looks like a treeeeeeeeeeee lol jessica
life is so stressful
and joshey woshey is a dead black man
OMFG I LOST MY CELL PHONE@!!!!!!!!
AHHHHHHHH IM SO MAD
 ima go




This poem that i write you
is not the normal kind
its just a simple poem
to get things off my mind
the boy i know and loved
haunts me everyday
i cant fall asleep at night
i cant get away
i claim i hate the boy i loved
and never wish to see his face
but infact the truth is
without him im a disgrace
i die to be near him
just one last time
although i wish he was gone
and never entered my mind
sometimes i wish we never met
we never became friends
if only that were true
thats not what happened in the end
the end is pretty basic
we were torn apart
he left me with a friendship
i left him with a broken heart

you know who you are"

"event","i have desided that i want jessicas mom. or romi's. but jessicas more. shes fuck!ng failing pe and her mom still lets her date and talk on the phone all she wants. and her mom actually likes me. there. sigh i am done.


the scars that you will never see
on my poor little wrists
are scabby and jagged
not cared for or bandaged
the blood runs free
out of my tortured body
in a way i am sorry for it
it must go through what my soul decides
my body is a doll in which i am in charge
i cut it and bruise it
that is my pleasure
my obsession
to feel the physical pain
that distracts me from the real pain
that i feel inside
it numbs me for what i live for
like every other being....death
it prepares me for what i will face
you don't pay attention when i am so obviosly in pain
i sulk around gloomily day after day
rubbing my sore wrists and flaunting them in front of you
you notice nothing
you're unaware that i torture myself each night when i shut my door
if you really did care
you would have noticed already
and that is all i need...
Just to be noticed."

"event","i hate my mom. big time.

im still pissed at my dad for not letting me go to battle of the bands but whatever... i can always ignore them and make them feel like sh!t... that always works.

we argue to much for me.
i cant take all this pain
the stress continues to pile on my shoulders
i think ive gone insane

i want to take a gun
and point it at my head
id pull the trigger really quick
and then I'd be dead.

i think I want to slit my wrists
i bet that feels good!
i want to die a slow, painful death
i thought u understood.

now i want to overdose,
i have a bunch of pills.
ill be trippin for awhile,
then i will become ill

maybe i should hang myself
i know the perfect tree
thatd look great on the front page paper,
girl hangs herself, 12, johnson, paulina
im so sick of fighting
i really want to die
i want to take back the fake smiles
And the real tears I cried.

i just want the old me back,
i want these painsoaked tears to dry.
i love you all, I really do.
but tonites my suicide"

"event","Someone please help me,
Im falling again;
And i can no longer see.

You said you would always be there,
So ... Why did you leave?
You said that you care.

But, I guess my problems are just to much for you,
Even though you still claim, 
""Thats not true!""

Now i guess this is the end,
Because im now through,
I have no more words to send.

And now, I pick up the knife,
And give my wrist one last slice,
Because tonight i will end my life.

today sucked and im tired.... ugh i wanna throw up"

im soo sick today i think i want to make myself throw up.... jelly knows why...... i got my cell phone back kuz some dude that works for my mom had to use it for their new show and got in major trouble kuz he used 2,007 minutes on my phone in 3 flippin weeks!!!!!! hes a freak and i keep getting all these weird phone calls and IM SICK ahhhhhh.... i want it to enDD!!!!!!
heres a poem....:

as i ball my hand into a fist 

im gonna slit my wrist

no one cares to hear my cries

no one would care if i were to die

i am me  

i am who i am

but thats still not enough i still have to pretend

just because im not a follower

doesnt mean im not human

i still feel  hurt i still feel pain

when i hear u say things about me i go home n cut 

silently

and shut the door behind me

how would u feel if u said the last thing to put 

me ova the edge

its called suicide 

u live or u die

if u commit to the shit 

i bet thats the one time i could make u cry 

is if u were always mean and you  were the 

reason a note was my last goodbye!!

Natalie just kept saying random and stupid things to me on the bus, it was so jokes. ""Look! Katiee a police car?!"" - ""OMG - wait, why do I care?"". We're stupid. ahaha, I love friends."

"event","Alright, so I'm really into these things called 'books' right now. I've read like 5 of them in the past 2 weeks. And I think I want more. I know this is a bad habit and I really have to control myself, and I say I can, but really I can't...I just keep turning the page. Then I think about all the money I'm wasting by buying these things, gosh I'm stupid. But I just can't stop. I sometimes think about telling my mom about my umm ""problem"", but I don't know how she would react, so I can't bring myself to tell her, I mean...what would she think of me?! Maybe when I snick to lowest low, like buying a 'hardcover' I'll snap out of it. Until' then, I have no idea where my educated life will lead me...

(was that just not the stupidest thing I've ever posted.)

Yesterday I went to Sherway for my first time since I was like 2...or maybe 5..or 10? Whatever that's clearly besides the point. So I went to Sherway with on of my bestest and well...we spent a 'wee' too much money. But that's ok; my mom thinks I only spent 40. I'd have to say, the biggest joke of the day was walking into Holt Renfue (sp?) and finding a ponytail maker on sale for...

45 DOLLARS!

Honestly, it was a normal black ponytail maker with some brown circle on it, what the fuck is so terribly special about that?! 

other then my stupid ballet exam coming up, the rest (or whats left) of the summer is going to be pretty sweet; there are some shows coming up that I really want to go to and PAULINSKA is coming home soon!"

"event","I would have never guessed that a coldsore could pervent you form doing so much...


...oh was I wrong.

Miss Natalie Musial prooved me very wrong. Last friday poor Natalie got a coldsore. How tragic (seriously). She just couldn't go on. First off, she needed her cream. Oh yes, the cream was definatly needed. So to get the cream she had a plan; she would call her mother during her fourth period lunch and ask her to bring her home. And of course she couldn't ride home on the bus when she had this coldsore...it was too big according to her.

(btw, you couldn't see it at all)

Sadly her mother didn't pick up the phone and Natalie would have to wait until' she was home to get the cream. On the bus ride home Natalie remember she had Veronicas hot tub party that same night. She then made an important anouncement. She probably couldn't go in the hot tub becaues of the coldsore. She was then told that she could go in the hot tub as long as she didn't kiss anyone, which wouldn't be a problem seeing as it was an all girl thing. What a relief. But wait there's more, she then remembered something else very important. She had a dance performance that weekend. But how could she possible dance with this coldsore?!?! Apprently no one would want to watch the performance because of her coldsore. How heartbreaking. But don't worry, we then told her that we could barely see anything while we were sitting beside her. Finally it was time to get off the bus for Natalie, but she had to make sure that her mother was parked at her bus stop because she could simply not walk home with a coldsore. That would be way too risky of course...plus she needed her cream as fast as possible, duh.

You never would have thought that a coldsore could cause so much problems. But oh yes it can. 

(Natalie you hilarious, I elect you funniest girl with an invisble coldsore.)"

well, what has happened since the last time i wrote on livejournal? Oh i'm sick and when i speak you will hear 'dead-man-horse-chicken-scratchy' noises.
yukky.
i miss my other friends. 
but i do have some AWESOME friends at holy name, and i wouldn't trade you guys for the world. i l&hearts;ve you natalie, veronica, cathy and emma.
[OH WE APPARENTLY CHANGED OUR CHARACTER EVENT FOR IMPROV? EXCITING!]

OH ANOTHER AWESOME SUPER THING WHICH HAPPENED TODAY!

An a'ccapella jazz group came to our school and we got to watch them perform, god they were hilarious. we died. twice. natalie wanted to hug them. veronica already had their CD. 
Oh lord and when one of the group members asked cathy a question her facce was pricless. 
and me and emma discovered Dylan, from the band looked like Jack form Will and Grace.


OH OSCAR PARTY ON SUNDAY.
must dress fancy.
i'm excited!

OH EVEN MORE EXCITING NEWS!
there was a supply teacher at our school a couple of weeks ago, and me and my friends at lunch started talking to him by telling him he looked like Jerry SEINFELD, and then we said Ray Ramono, and he's said ""Oh great, as you keep staring you keep coming up with uglier people that i look like."" so anyways, he gave us gum and he was super funny. AND then today WHILE I WAS AT MY GRANDMAS i see him in the mail room.  HE APPARENTLY LIVES IN MY GRANDMAS building. holy shit.
so as soon as i saw him i kinda yelled at him, IN A HAPPY MANNER, and then called natalie and we freaked out.

god it was funny.

life is sweet, like a poptart.

ps: i kept smelling something funny all day, natalie says its because i'm sick...i don't see her with a doctors badge!

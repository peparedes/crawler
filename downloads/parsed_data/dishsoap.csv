"event","Things here are good. I'm really tired because I was at the Alix Olson show last night! It was really good, except that people were talking through a lot of performances before hers. Finally, Doria Roberts, who is another fav performer of mine, said something very eloquently about how we were lucky to have a space for women and that we should be using that space to respect the performers, not to act like it was some kind of punk-rock show. (She didn't say the punk part..she said something about performers deserving that space, too...but people acted like the music was background noise!) So that was good. People were still kind of sucky, though....I could tell Alix Olson was off, probably from the talking. At one point these two people were having a whole conversation right off-stage while she was performing and she stopped dead in the midle of the poem, went over and said something to them, and then resumed where she left off. It was great that she did it in her cute Alix Olson way, but it was fucked that people were so disrespectful. Especially for that kind of line-up at such a good price! 

Anyway..it was great to see Leslie Feinberg, too. I realized that I have now met just about every one of my sheroes and heroes...crazy, huh?! Also, I discovered this women, Ellis, whose CD I bought...she was really funny and nice and I love her sound. She is very folkie and really down to earth..I was like, ""can you sign my disc?"" like the nerd that I am and she was totally flattered and cool about it. I think that that's just as much a part of good art as the art itself. Alix is always nice, but even she has this attitude like she knows just how great she is. Ellis was totally like someone you could hang out with and be friends and just kinda make music. Not like ""my music is brilliant art!"" She's cute, too! 

I took a taxi home from the show and that was almost the highlight of my evening. The driver's name was Zal and he was an immigrant from Africa. We had a whole conversation about the work that I do and how he just thought that racism was the way that it is...not that there are people who are refusing to accept it. I gave him a $3 tip on a $5 ride. He thanked me, and I told him he deserved it (which he did! Can you believe what it would be like to have to chauffer unappreciateive people around all day for $5.15/hr before taxes??) and he said that nobody had ever told him that before. 

What a fucked-up world we live in. He offered to wait until I got in the door and I totally thanked him. He didn't have to do that, he's probably not supposed to, but it made me feel like I had a friend. I'm just glad that he knows that he has a friend, too, and that he is allowed to feel like he is not getting what he deserves. 

Work is going really well...I am totally on top of my deadlines despite all these complications, so it feels good to feel effecient!I'm almost done with all the background details so I'm going to be talking to a lot of really interesting, cool people! Hopefully things will turn out well and I can use the model that I've built for other stuff. It feels good to build something, you know?"

"event","Things here are great! Work has picked up and it's going along well. I'm pretty much settled in to everything and feling good about stuff. I'm getting really excited about Ladyfest!! 

Today I was talking to Kris about assorted stuff...sex, etc, being one of the topics and my housemate, Roy, overheard me and now I think he thinks I'm some kind of sex fanatic...oh well. To make it worse I was playing Alix O and he walked in on ""Cunt Cuntry"" or something equally as....expressive. But, we've been getting along OK and he offered to check out bicycles with me if I decided to get one, so that's good! Nicole, my other housemate, is in CA visiting friends for two weeks, so things are pretty quiet around here. 

I spent the weekend up at my Aunt's house in the mountains which was really beautiful! Other than that things aren't extremely exciting. I really want to do some paper mache, but I need masking tape first so I have to remember that. I think Ladyfest will be a lot of fun and I am hoping to make some connections with people so I have friends to hang with outside of my housemates. Things are way different than I thouh they'd be, but I'm still psyched to be here!! 

Anyway, I think that's it for now....more next time!"

"event","Ahh, another post....

Let's see...I am all settled in my house. Both of my housemates are Canadian so I fear I am going to get back to CA speaking Canadia. Like Lauren! I like everyone here a lot..my housemates rock and we live in this awesome neighborhood where the neighbors are all friendly. We spend the evenings hanging out with the neighbors and talking about random stuff. Nicole is really friendly and totally on the same page as I am ethically...and Roy is kind of on the opposite end from both of us but he is nice and seems interested in having conversations. I think I annoy him a little bit, more than Nicole, at least, but what conservative person don't I annoy? 

I started my job and I'm having a little trouble settling in, but I think it will be OK. Everyone is kind of working on different things and not too interested in being friendly, for the most part, so it's kind of weird. I sort of sit in my office attempting to stay out of everyone's way and working....well, trying to work: my boss kind of seems to expect that I know what he's looking for even though he hasn't exactly given me clear structure of what I'm supposed to be doing. I have a meeting with him on Friday, though, and I think things will get better. 

I am getting to be kind of friends with the tech guy...(I know that calling him ""tech guy""  is horrible but I can't spell his name and I don't want to botch it up!) He is really neat and he's got the best sense of humor and this warmness about him! He is currently studying to be a Dr. and he is a refugee from Afghanistan so it's totally interesting to talk to him. I think that I'll invite him over for tea or something one day. Other than that there's something I'm unsure about with the people I work with. My boss, Bill, is really nice, though..and our office manager is also very hospitable, but not someone I could see hanging out and getting close to. Who knows, though! 

I wanted to go to a meeting at Rainbow Alley, Denver's Queer Youth drop-in center, but I was so tired and hungry by the time that I got down there that all I wanted to do was go home. I will try another day. I just wasn't quite feeling up for meeting a bunch more new people.

Other than that things are good...I'm looking forward to getting more into work and, hopefully, getting closer to my co-workers. I do miss my old job where I know that I am good at what I do and, no matter how bad of a day I'm having, I can go back to the office knowing that the people that I work with are my friends. And, of course, I miss my family and my friendies, but that should go without saying! I am still psyched to be here and enjoying myself, though. Next week is Ladyfest Out West so I'm psyched about that...Alix Olson, here I come!!"

"event","Hi Friends!!

Well...I thought that instead of e-mailing everyone with the nitty gritty excitement and/or details of my life, I would post it here. TADA!! This way, you can read at your own leisure (and risk!) and even, for the brave, post comments. There are all kinds of things that I could tell you, but I am on someone else's very slow computer so I will wait until Ms. Magnum Opus (otherwise known as my laptop) is hooked up to the in-ter-net to write in legnth about the raunchy happenings in the life of Maayan. 

Inthe meantime: I arrived in Boulder with few complications and have spent these past days living ""the life"" with my grandparents. Tomorrow I am moving to Denver to live in a pre-19th century row house in the center of, what used to be, the ""ghetto."" (No more Larkfield for me!) My grandmother regards me as her current ""project"" in which she can fuss over. She has made sure to tell every one of her JAP-ie (Jewish American Princess)friends  about what a dump I'm living in and how worrying about my being here is taking years off of her life. I have promised to wear a whistle at all times in case I am attacked. Someone might want my multi-purpose Victronox bag, afterall --my prized posession. 

I am both nervous and excited about moving: my grandparents' apartment is painted entirely in a terracotta-salmon color. My grandfather is a retired engineer gone psychologist, so the color is supposed to be calming --I think that if I have to stare at the walls anymore I will go crazy. Secondly, if it's not green, leafy, and without taste, they don't eat it. That is an exagerration, but not by much. They are self-improvement addicts and, after 17 years, have not yet discovered that some people like how they are. My grandparents are, however, very loving and generous people who I have inherited many wonderful traits from. Though, some traits I think I would go postal trying to put up with myself. 

I am nervous about Denver because just today I read an extensive article in ""The Westword"", Denver's progressive, artsy paper, about the freaks and addicts that tantalize passengers on the city busses. It documented all kinds of crime and creepiness that happens at all hours through public transportation. Heroine addicts and homeless people...self-titled gurus, leprechauns (sp??)... -It was very funny until I realized that, as of tomorrow, I will be one of those passengers. AHHH!! That whistle thing isn't so funny anymore. 

Well, I am being taken out to dinner so I must go. More later! XOXO"

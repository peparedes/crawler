"event","<P>Sunday, my birthday, Conner wakes up at the butt crack of dawn (8:30am) and proceeds to eat 7 peanut butter cookies for his breakfast. Then, he eats a bowl of cereal because he's still hungry. </P>
<P><BR>I hear the boys just as they're finishing their cereal and I wake Pat up. Pat wakes up and feels like crapt (massive headache, nausia, etc.) and is a lump on the couch in about 10 minutes. </P>
<P><BR>Meanwhile, I'm in the bathroom putting my eyes (contacts) in and I can hear Conner all way way from his room to ours and he's saying, ""Suck my Dick!"" over and over. I leave our bedroom and just stare down the hall towards Conner's room. Tyler comes out of his room and looks at me and I say, ""Yeah, I heard it."" Pat is out in the living room being a zombie and didn't hear a word of it. Apparently he tuned it all out. </P>
<P><BR>I told him, ""Well, I heard the phrase 'Suck my dick!' more than I cared to and if you don't do something about it I will and it's not going to be pretty."" Then I turned around and closed the door to our bedroom. </P>
<P><BR>I asked Conner to please stop talking so rudely because I didn't want to spend my birthday like that. He ignored me and Pat when he echoed what I said. </P>
<P><BR>Needless to say, between Conner's attitude, Tyler's yelling at the video game he was playing and Pat being out of commission . . . my birthday morning was horrible. </P>
<P><BR>Pat eventually moved into the bedroom to lay down. From then until 11:50am when I finally got dressed and cleaned up the kitchen from my solo breakfast, the yelling and shouting and rude behavior didn't stop. </P>
<P><BR>So, I told Pat that as soon as I was ready, I was going to leave because I couldn't take it any more. </P>
<P><BR>Before I left, I confronted Conner and asked him how many cookies he at and eventually got it out of him. I told him that he just lost his right to anything sweet (this included chocolate milk, pop and anything else) until Tuesday. </P>
<P><BR>And then I left. </P>
<P><BR>I filled up on the cheapest gas I could find in a 10 minute radius, picked up at $1 chicken sandwich &amp; drink from McDonald's and found a parking lot and read my book for an hour. </P>
<P><BR>Fast forward to Monday . . . we're having hamburgers and home made french fries and the boys are bickering back and forth at the dinner table. This happens every night at dinner and I'm getting fed up. </P>
<P><BR>Last night at dinner. I make my first pot roast and it turns out okay except the gravy is a little salty. No biggie we all survived. However, the fighting between the boys is wearing on me and I was very close to throwing it in and eating by myself in the living room. Instead I said to Pat, ""Maybe you should come home, make dinner and then have them ruin it for a change."" </P>
<P><BR>I was quite pissed by then but he just looked at me and said, ""Huh?"" </P>
<P><BR>I just took a deep breath and then said, ""They fight at the table every night for dinner. I'm sick of it. So maybe <STRONG>you </STRONG>should make dinner after you get home from work and let them ruin dinner."" </P>
<P><BR>Later, after Pat took Conner to the store to find some more items for his Halloween costume (which I thought he shouldn't have done because his attitude was horrible) things were quiet. Tyler did his homework and then when they came back, it started all over again. </P>
<P><BR>I was reading my book on the couch and Pat sat down next to me to watch some TV. A couple of minutes later, Conner comes and sits down next to Pat and he's playing with gum. ""Why did you buy him gum? It's just going to end up on the floor again and I'm going to step in it, again."" </P>
<P><BR>Then, the attitude started again and eventually he went into Tyler's room and left every single thing that ran on electricity, turned on. </P>
<P><BR>By then, I had had enough and retreated to the bedroom and planned on staying in there for the rest of the evening. But not before I turned off everything in Conner's room. </P>
<P><BR>I've told them, if I find it and it's on when you haven't been in your room for more than 10 minutes it's getting turned off whether they saved their game or not. And, 20 minutes later, Conner came out and had a fit and started throwing things in his room. </P>
<P><BR>Pat went in and then told me why he was upset and the words, ""Oh well..."" came out of my mouth. </P>
<P><BR>About 30 minutes later, Pat comes in and asks if I'm going to stay in here all night. I said yes and he said that he didn't want me to be upset. </P>
<P><BR>Well, it's kinda hard to not be upset when those two are acting up and ignoring me and Pat and doing whatever they want. So, to save my sanity I left their presence and retreated to the one place that's mine. He said that he gets upset when I'm upset and I said, ""Well, I'm sorry but that's just how it is. They act like shits and get out of control, I'm not going to sit around and watch it happen."" </P>
<P><BR>So, for the past three days and nights I've had enough. I have no more patience for their bad behavior and it's taking everything I have to keep myself from yelling at them. </P>
<P><BR>Just last night, Conner had another fit about me throwing away the pumpkin seeds. When I informed him that I won't bake them (they're in the fridge right now) until he can consistantly be have for more than 30 minutes at a time. He yelled, ""Well thanks for telling me now!"" I just shruged and said, ""Oh well,"" and walked away. </P>
<P><BR>It hasn't been very long since we've all been here (only a month and a half) but I'm slowly losing it . . . </P>"

"event","<P>Well, Pat talked to another woman at the apartment complex and asked some more questions and they talked for a few minutes. He called me afterwards and said that we're okay and that we don't have anything to worry about. She said that we shouldn't fret over small things like that. </P>
<P>There are only a few things that I can't do until I'm added to the lease:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Can't change my mailing address</LI>
<LI>Can't park in front of the apartment</LI>
<LI>Can't call in maintenance issues with the apartment</LI>
<LI>Can't have a key to the mailbox</LI></UL>
<P>But I think that Pat might work around that one and just have a copy made for me anyway. </P>
<P>So, that's the short of it and we're both relieved beyond belief.</P>

"event","<P><STRONG><U>Friday </U></STRONG><BR>Exhaustion. Pure exhaustion. I stayed home and watch my Sci-Fi Friday TV and talked to Pat for over an hour afterwards. He finds out that his ""miracle worker"" lady his parents have been raving about has nothing good to tell him. The best she can get for him is $74,000 towards a house. There is nothing in this county (other than a trailer ina trailer park) available, and liveable, for less than $100,000. So, we've decided to look at renting something for a year and hopefully the situation will be better a year from now and we can get some more finances and other things to look better as well. </P>
<P><STRONG><U>Saturday</U></STRONG> <BR>Had an okay day until 1pm and then had a breakdown. I spoke to Pat and the wanted to try and do something wit me and the boys but with the cast a lot of things are out for me. So, I told him, ""Just do something with the boys and get some quality time together and call me later."" He says he'll call the movie theater and see if they can make arrangements for me and my cast and then call me later. </P>
<P>I get a call around 5:15pm and he tells me that the movie theater said no-go because anything extra (to prop my foot up on) would be considered a fire hazzard. I kinda knew it so I wasn't surprised by their answer. So, he asks me, ""What do you want to do?"" I've been having a semi-bad ""I feel like shit and utterly useless"" day so having him ask me that just sent me over the edge. I basically said, ""If I knew what to do I'd be the first one to tell you. But I""m pretty limited in what I can do because I have to prop my foot up or else my toes and my leg will swell. So, to put it nicely, 'I'm fucked!' is my situation."" </P>
<P>We talk some more and I try and tell him, that there's nothing I can really do other than be a bump on a log because of my current cast-status. I can't handle it any more and I'm crying like crazy and say, ""I gotta go, bye"" and then hang up on him. </P>
<P>I spent the next hour crying and hobbling to the bathroom and then another hour in the recliner feeling sorry for myself. </P>
<P>I finally get an appetite for something to eat around 7:15 so I give him a call and tell him that I'm feeling better and that I'll be over with something to eat soon. </P>
<P>So, I eat my dinner (chicken sandwich and fries) then we head upstairs (with no a/c or fan) and watch Sin City. </P>
<P>We putter around for awhile and the boys behave themselves pretty well and then we head for bed a little after 11pm but it's not even 20 minutes later when I have another bought and end up crying and Pat's asking, ""What did I do?"" Somewhere between sobs and sniffling I tell him that it's nothing to do with him but that I feel so utterly useless and that it's 8 weeks worth of frustration just coming to the surface and I can't hold it back any more. So, he does the good boyfriend thing and just cuddles me and tells me that he hates to see me so upset and that if he could, he'd fix everything for me. </P>
<P>Takes me about 20 minutes to calm down and then somewhere around there it's lights out because I don't remember anything. </P>
<P><STRONG><U>Sunday </U></STRONG><BR>7:30am wake-up call from Pat when he crawls back in bed but I don't mind. It gives us some ""alone time"" in bed before we head upstairs an hour later to get a start on our day. </P>
<P>We have breakfast then between all the chaos that are the boys, we finally head out al ittle after 1pm to check out 2 rental houses and an apartment complex that has a 3-bedroom unit available. </P>
<P><STRONG><A href=""http://www.realtor.com/Prop/1050108599"">House #1</A></STRONG><BR>Crossed off the list. It looks ""okay"" on the outside and a total pig-sty inside. Someone is obviously living in there (sign on the door says to watch out for cats when you opent he door) and there are dirty clothes and shoes and dirty pots/pans all over the place. They're asking for $900/month and want $137,000 for the house itself. Next! </P>
<P><STRONG><A href=""http://www.realtor.com/Prop/1050153933"">House #2</A></STRONG> <BR>Might be a possibility. 900-ish sq. feet. 1 car detached garage. 3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, finished basement. New vinyl siding and what seems like freshly painted trim. No door or doorwall leading to the backyard...front and side doors. The windows look really old and to be made of aluminum. This has a big question mark on it right now. The rent would be $950/month. </P>
<P><STRONG>Apartment Complex 1.</STRONG> Three bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 100-1200 sq. ft. The property is very nice and the oldest units are 8 years old. The 3 bedroom unit is the only one that'll be available soon but there is a 2 bedroom until that we're going to check out tomorrow after work (they're almost identical except for the 3rd bedroom) to get a feel for it and get a better look at the entire complex. Rent would be around $1025/month but for all the extra room it would be worth it. Pat's father said he'd help chip in for the security deposit and some rent money for awhile while our expenses are tight. Only thing with this is, if we decided we want to be here and we're approved, we have 7 days to move in. </P>

"event","<P>Sunday morning as everyone (but Pat &amp; myself) got ready to head out the door for their vacation up north, I got a big surprise.</P>
<P>Everyone was outside loading up the truck and then as I'm starting to make my way to the stairs to go up and then outside to see everyone off, in comes Conner and he races down the stairs, hugs me and says goodbye. I hug him back tell him to have fun but to also be good. He says ""Okay"" and then races back up the stairs.</P>
<P>Before I can move, Tyler is down the stairs and gives me a hug and tells me goodbye too. I hug him back, say, ""Have a good time but try and listen to your grandpa, okay?"" He smiles, says, ""Thanks and I will"" and then races back outside.</P>
<P>So . . . I got hugs from both of the boys&nbsp;even though I found out that Marty had to prod them to come down. He told them, ""She can't come up here as easily as you can go down there.""&nbsp; But that's okay. The fact that they did it and hugged me without hesitation (especially Tyler since he doesn't hug me as often as Conner does) was very sweet.</P>

"event","<SPAN class=postlistpostbody>So, most of you know that Pat has asked me to go with him and the boys when he moves (I told him that I would but that I won't put my name on the mortgage unless our names match). He said ""No problem."" <BR><BR>That was about a month ago. <BR><BR>Fastforward to Saturday night. We're sitting at a table with his parents (playing Euchre; Marty and I kicked Pat &amp; Barb's butts!) and his mom says: ""Those pots and pans I ordered will be in soon. But if you're not getting them until you're outta here."" <BR><BR>I laugh and proceed to trump her card and she yells at me, ""You PITA!"" <BR><BR>Then she says to Pat, ""If you don't then they'll just sit here."" <BR><BR>Marty says, ""Oh no they're not. You're not keeping more junk in this house!"" <BR><BR>Barb says, ""Fine, then I'll just have to give them away. Maybe a wedding present."" <BR><BR>Marty says, ""Who's getting married? Sheila doesn't need any thing because John'll buy it for her."" <BR><BR>Barb laughs and says, ""Well, maybe Pat."" <BR><BR>Pat's dealing cards and says, ""One thing at a time here...there's a way of doing things and an order that needs to be followed."" <BR><BR>I think he was going to say, ""I need a house first,"" but he didn't say anything else after that. <BR><BR>Barb and Marty laugh and she says, ""Well, you better hurry up because they're coming and I want to get rid of these couches too!"" <BR><BR>I just smiled, laughed and kept my mouth shut. <BR><BR>The topic of marriage and engagements has come up before so I know that Pat is the kind of guy who likes to plan this type of thing all on his own and that he doesn't like to be pushed. No problem. I don't want to know when it's coming anyway. That's where all the emotion is anyway. <BR><BR>Ya know what I mean? <BR><BR>Anyway . . . I just wanted to post this wee, little revelation that allowed a small peak into his brain where the big M is concerned. <IMG alt=posticon src=""http://img.runboard.com/img/default_post_icons/happy.gif""></SPAN>"

<P><FONT color=#6600cc>I brought over the maps I made for Pat so he can see where&nbsp;family (his and&nbsp;mine),&nbsp;his place of work and mine all are geographically. We talked shortly about the new area I scoped out (Ferndale/Royal Oak) and there are a lot of available houses (more than in our neck of the woods) for under $100,000. But, he's pretty set on stayin in the same area so he can get help from his dad and brothers. I told him that I was looking at a location that wouldn't be too hard on either of us for going to/from work but he didn't like it. Oh well, I tried. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc><STRONG>Saturday</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>I left the house early for my Dr. appointment then went home and crashed for a bit (very tired) then took a shower and crashed again. It was almost 4pm by the time I got up (again) and dried my hair (it was 1/2 dry) and packed a back for the rest of the weekend with Pat. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>We ended up getting a movie but didn't watch it and Sheila came over and the four of us (including Barb) stayed up until almost midnight playing Euchre. We didn't get anywhere near the movie.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc><STRONG>Sunday </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>A very slow day. Pat and I didn't get out of bed until almost 10am . . . a new record for either of us. By the time we had breakfast, showered and were ready to go anywhere, it was almost 1pm. Sheila volunteered to take the boys to the driving range (golf) but she had the Vette and could only take one. So, all five of us end up at the driving range.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc size=3>Pat has brought up the idea of letting Tyler (he'll be 13 next May) try his hand at being a Caddy at one of the local golf courses next summer. </FONT><FONT color=#6600cc size=3>Tyler has no ""work ethic"" (he can't take out the trash on a weekly basis) what so ever and needs, in a bad way, to learn that most people work hard for their money and that money just doesn't keep coming out of your pockets when you want it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc size=3>Tyler has recently said that he wants to try golf now (Pat is having more money nightmares) but has absolutely no desire to take any golf lessons. He thinks he can just go out there and do his thing and be okay. He's also not one to take constructive criticism very well. Pat tried to give him pointers on how to stand and swing the club yesterday (at the driving range) and Tyler just blew up at him and said, ""Gee thanks for letting me know how stupid I am dad!"" and threw down his club and sat down on the divider. Pat just rolled his eyes, said, ""I'm only trying to help you improve but if you want to do it your way, be my gues,"" and walked back over to sit down next to me.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc><FONT size=3>So, I'll have to revisit this&nbsp;next summer and see if it goes anywhere.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>We stop at the store on the way back to the house so Pat can pick up his lunch meat (he'll only eat Kowalski Bologna and no other kind of bologna). </FONT></P><FONT color=#6600cc>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>Conner immediately kicks off his shoes and leaves them where I can trip over therem. So, I tell him, ""Get down here and put these shoes where they're supposed to go.""&nbsp; He huffs and says, ""Oh my god! They're not in the way.""&nbsp; I've had it by then and say, ""Don't you 'Oh my God' me. Get down here and put them away."" He huffs some more but comes down and puts them away. I almost smacked my own hand over my mouth when I said, ""Don't you 'Oh my God' me."" <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_ZSYYYYYYYYUS"" target=_blank><IMG alt=""Oh Jeez"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_13_3.gif"" border=0></A></FONT></P>
<P>After that, Pat heads out to cut the lawn while I bum it on the couch and put my foot back up (it was feeling a little swollen again). I had a half sandwich (using his bologna, hehe) while he was outside and read a bit of my book at the counter as well. He takes a break to come in for lunch (always ice cold milk and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on the weekends) then goes back outside to fnish up. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>About 3:30 Pat asks if I want to go to the movies and I say, ""Of course,"" so we then planned on the 4:45 showing of The Fantastic Four and head out. Before we left the house Pat told them, ""If you're hungry now, eat a little something here because you're not going to get anything other than something to drink while we're there. Do you understand me?""&nbsp; Of course they both had a mini-fit but we left anyway. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>The boys were talking about goig to see Rebound and I just cringed in my seat. Pat dropped me off at the door so I wouldn't have to walk across the parking lot and I headed in. I waited a minute and when I still saw them circling around, I walked up to the counter and bought 4 tickets for The Fantastic Four. Yeah, it might've been kinda crappy of me to do, but I wasn't about to sit through Rebound if I had anything to say about it. They walked up to me just as I was getting my change back (I ended up paying for the tickets, but no biggie). Then, they headed straight for the concession stand and I said, ""I'm going to go in and sit down,"" while they looked for a short line to get their icee's (frozen coke). 10 minutes later, they come in with icee's and Pat has a medium bag of pop corn which he gave Conner about 1/4 of in a separate bag. Meanwhile, Tyler is still moaning about not being able to get some candy. And he's still moaning about it when we leave the theater and we're discussing what to have for dinner. ""If you had let me get some candy I wouldn't be so hungry now!"" he's practically yelling. I told him, ""You had a chicken thigh before we left so you shouldn't be nearly as hungry as you're claiming to be."" He got snotty and said, ""Just because no one else is doesn't meant that I'm not!""</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>We're still discussing what to have for dinner and Pat asks them what they want. Sloppy Joe's is Tyler's response and Conner says, ""Whatever.""&nbsp; Pat and Tyler go into Kroger while Conner and I stay in the car. It takes them about 10 minutes to buy 3 items and Pat forgets to buy french fries. After we're on the road, I can hear Tyler's lips smacking and say, ""What are you eating?"" I look at Pat and he says, ""It's just Mike &amp; Ikes.""&nbsp; I just give him a look and he get's defensive, ""What?!?""&nbsp; I just look at him and say, ""Never mind. I'm not going to say anything,"" and then turn my head to look out the window. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>Back at the house I end up cooking some potato wedges along with the sloppy joe's&nbsp; and the boys are getting ready to head outside. Meanwhile, Tyler is still munching on the box of candy and I said, ""Stop eating those! We'll be having dinner in about 20-25 minutes!"" Tyler laughs and says, ""Just one more!"" and then Pat yells at him from the grill. I just stand at the stove and shake my head. Why can't Pat see that he's just letting them do whatever they want?&nbsp; **sigh**</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>10 minutes later, Pat and I are talking in the kitchen when&nbsp;there's some kind of commotion at the front door and then Conner is diving down the stairs with all his goalie pads and skates still on, his feet/skates going all over the wall as he dives down the stairs. I shout, ""Hey, what's going on?!?"" and Pat yells at Conner about having all his stuff on while in the house. Meanwhile, Conner is hiding behind Pat and here comes Tyler after him. Apparently, Tyler was shooting the buck at Conner extra high and Conner got fed up with it and stopped what he was doing. That's when Tyler started after him and Conner fled into the house. Conner stripped all his stuff off and left it in the kitchen and then pouted. Tyler starts after him again when Conner tries to sneak past him, and puts him in a head lock and then tries to push him into the ground. Pat tears them apart and makes Tyler go outside. All the while, Tyler is laughing at Conner. Conner takes his gear and puts it away in the garage and then heads upstairs. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>There's about 10 more minutes of peace when Conner comes back downstairs, holding his right shoulder and crying. Apparently, Tyler came back in the house, went upstairs, and pushed Conner into something and took the memory card out of the GameCube. Pat knows that Conner's memory card was in there earlier this morning and now it's missing and Tyler claims that he doesn't know where it is. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>This kind of shit happens all the time and yet, Pat doesn't really do much about it. I understand his frustration. Barb undermines him constantly because she won't agree to follow along with the rules/restrictions that Pat sets on the boys. He can't ground them because Barb'll push them outside after 15 minutes because they're bugging her.&nbsp; <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_ZSYYYYYYYYUS"" target=_blank><IMG alt=Dismay src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_6_102.gif"" border=0></A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>Pat cannot get out and into a house or condo soon enough . . . and since I'll be living there, Pat and I will most definately have to be on the same page when it comes to the boys. When I use my, ""I'm not kidding,"" voice with the boys, they may huff about it, they they end up doing what I tell them to do. And, when I ask for help (especially when I can't walk quite right) I always use ""please help me"" and say ""thank you"" when we're done. It's cool and they always say, ""Sure,"" when I ask. So, we'll see how things are once everything is squared away and we're all in one place with no one else around. I get the feeling that the phrase, ""She's strict"" will be soon replaced with something a bit more mean. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>Oh well, them's the breaks. I only put up with so much from the boys and they pretty much know when I've had enough and not to tick me off. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>Okay, I'm rambling now and not making much sense of anything now so I'll end this here.</FONT></P>"

<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Brandy:</STRONG> </FONT><FONT color=#000000>YAHOO!!!!!&nbsp; You go girl!!!&nbsp; About damn time that Pat got off his ass and stopped taking you for granted!!&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I really like Pat, I just hate to see it when he asumes things about your relationship.&nbsp; (But who doesn't hate that about any of their friends and families ralationships?!)&nbsp; Wooo Hooo!!&nbsp; Bianca's Shackin' Up!!&nbsp; You Slut! <IMG src=""http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/03.gif"">&nbsp; You know I love you!</FONT></P>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000>Congrats to you both!!!&nbsp; Maybe by Christmas we'll be seeing a ring on your finger?!</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000>
<DIV><FONT color=#000099 size=3>Hey, he's a guy and he just assumes things. That's how he is. But, I do keep reminding him that I don't assume anything about anything so he shouldn't assume anything about me either. <IMG src=""http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/18.gif"">&nbsp;Hey, no slut callin'!&nbsp;<IMG src=""http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/18.gif"">&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000099 size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000099 size=3>As for a ring, Chris (here at work) said the same thing to me. ""Make him get you some bling-bling girl.""</FONT></DIV></FONT></DIV>
<P><FONT color=#000000>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Jill:</STRONG> </FONT><FONT color=#000000>All I have to say at this point is CONGRATULATIONS!!!!&nbsp; How exciting that not only is Pat taking the initiative and really moving on things finally, but that he wants you to be a part of it all.&nbsp; It's a huge step, and I know the two of you will make&nbsp;the decision that is right for you all.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;think choosing not to&nbsp;discuss things with your mom and Chuck at this point is the wise thing to do.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000>I am very happy for you!&nbsp; What a wonderful development.&nbsp; Obviously keep us posted on how things develop!</FONT><FONT color=#000000><BR></DIV></FONT>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000>Hugs!!!!&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000099 size=3>Hey girlie! </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000099 size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000099><FONT size=3>Yeah, that appears to be the overall reaction to the news. A mutual friend of ours said, ""It's about DAMN TIME!""</FONT>&nbsp; <IMG src=""http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/18.gif""><IMG src=""http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/18.gif""></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000099></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000099 size=3>I will most definately keep you all up to date on what happens.</FONT></DIV></DIV>
<P><FONT color=#000000>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Shelly:</STRONG>&nbsp; </FONT><FONT color=#000000>:) I know it'll all work out well for you guys. Seems like things have been heading in this direction for some time now anyways. It's good to know he's thinking it too, since men are so terrible at communicating these things! haha<BR><BR>As far as the boys.... ugh! How do ya handle something like that? It's gotta crush Pat to hear his kids say ""we're poor"" when Pat's worked so hard all this time to provide for them in the way that their Mother CLEARLY doesn't want to be bothered with. And all the<BR>time making sacrifices for them. </FONT></P>
<P><BR><FONT color=#000000>But they're kids and they won't ever understand that until they're out on their own someday having to struggle along. Hopefully then they'll appreciate all Pat's done for them. </FONT></P>
<DIV><FONT color=#000099 size=3>Communication and Pat don't go so well together. I have to ask him about certain things (like how it went with the doctor {for Conner} or the Mortgage guys) or else he won't tell me anything. Men. <IMG src=""http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/25.gif""></FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000099 size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000099 size=3>As for the boys and the ""we're poor"" thing. It's nothing new. They've used that many a time when Pat's told them it was a tight week and that they couldn't go do something. I've told him, ""Just tell them that yes, I'm more strapped for money than your friends parents but I do the best I can."" But he won't. Don't worry though, I will. I have no problem telling them how things are. I even use the, ""You may not understand it now, but you will in a few years and then you'll come back and apologize to your dad.""</FONT></DIV>
<P><FONT color=#000000>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Tonya:</STRONG> </FONT><FONT color=#000000>About damn time!!! Yay you guys! :D</FONT></P><FONT color=#000000>
<DIV><FONT color=#000099><IMG src=""http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/18.gif"">&nbsp;&nbsp; You crack me up.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000099></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000099>Hey, he's a slow mover . . . what can I say? </FONT><BR></DIV></FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Belle: </STRONG></FONT>Wow! Reading between the lines . . . I'd say super cool, neat-o! <BR></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Minde:</STRONG> </FONT><FONT color=#000000>Wow!!!!&nbsp; I don't know what else to say but WOW! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Me too . . . that's how I felt after I hung up the phone last night. LOL</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Charyl:</STRONG> </FONT><FONT color=#000000>That's cool!&nbsp; But tell that man he needs to communicate more.&nbsp; That&nbsp; would've drove me crazy.&nbsp; :)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><FONT color=#000099>I'm trying! He's gotten better at it since we've been together. I still have my work cut out for me though. ;)</FONT><BR></P></FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000000>Diane: </FONT></STRONG><FONT color=#000000>It sounds like things are going in the right direction.&nbsp; I'm sure you're excited but yet nervous.&nbsp; It's a big step.</FONT></P>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000>You might want to start looking with him.&nbsp; There are so many things to look at when buying a house and the two of you will be able to ""weed"" things out.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000>Is this Pat's first home?&nbsp; They have special rates for first time home buyers. The housing market has slowed down so he may be able to put in a much lower bid and have it accepted.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000>From experience: </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT color=#000000>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go thru the listing and see what you can live with or without&nbsp;from your list ""Things you want in a home""</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never let realtor get you to put an offer in right away</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a big step and it's very easy to get caught up in all the&nbsp;excitement</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take your time&nbsp;then when all is done, Enjoy the new home!</FONT></DIV>

<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Wow ...big step huh? Are you breathing okay? LOL {{{{{HUGS}}}}}</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Yeah, I'm breathing okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_ZSYYYYYYYYUS"" target=_blank><FONT color=#000099><IMG alt=Happy src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_1_3v.gif"" border=0></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>When I hung up the phone last night, I just kinda stood there and&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_ZSYYYYYYYYUS"" target=_blank><FONT color=#000000><FONT color=#000099><IMG alt=Buggin src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/10/10_1_5.gif"" border=0></FONT><BR></FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Apart from probably feeling overwhelmed by it, how do you feel about it?</STRONG> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Well, aside from the huge overwhelming feeling and wee bit of shock . . . I'm okay. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>I was kinda freaking out a little bit yesterday around 3pm but it wore off and then my brain started working over time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>It'll be a first for me. Growing up, it was mom, me &amp; sis and then dad. So, I've never been in a household where I was the minority gender. It'll definately be a whole new world that'll open up to my eyes. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>I'm already telling them, ""Shut off the light please,"" because they don't know how to shut off lights. Yeah the grumble about it but they still do it. So, I'm not too worried about asking them to do things for me and not having them listen to me. We've spent enough time together for them to know that I'm not someone you can walk all over. I've told&nbsp;YSS that I would have no problem&nbsp;taking him to school in his underwear because he refused to get dressed. I've got the ""I'm not kidding"" look down pat. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>So, as the time draws closer and I'm sure the anxiety will grow I'm sure I'll feel like I'm losing my mind but I think it's something that's ""good"" for me and for DSO &amp; the boys.

<P><FONT color=#000099>You know, just about every other person has asked me something similar to that.

<P><FONT color=#000099>Yeah...it's gonna be weird.<BR><BR>This is the 2nd biggest thing to happen to me (the 1st being my dad passing awy). <BR><BR>I think I was in shock last night after I hung up the phone. But now, I think I'm starting to freak out and I feel weird. Not bad weird, but weird.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Happy for you.&nbsp; It's a big life-changing moment but if you break it down it isn't so scary. You're just moving in with new roommates, ones you know. That's all. And one of them can service you on a much more regular basis. Plus the extra income will help with all those &nbsp; ""unneeded"" things, which will earn eternal gratitude. </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Yeah, roommates who are all of the opposite gender. I've never been ""out numbered"" before so this'll be something new for me. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Lots of big life changing events suck and can be terrible. You've been through those. Try taking a leap this time on something that is better. This is a growth opportunity. Things can be rough but no matter how you look at it, they will be better.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Yeah, I think I came to realise that some time last night as I was trying to get to sleep. <IMG src=""http://www.xsorbit.com/httpimages/smiley.gif""></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>As far as the credit thing, Just do it all with him initially and then, depending on how things develop and progress, add your name later. It's been done before.</STRONG> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Well, seeing as I'm in the ""repairing my credit"" stage (I had to get a cosigner for my &lt;$10k car loan) I don't think the mortgage guy will recommend that I be put on along with Pat. Maybe later on down the road when my car payments are near the end (I've only just dipped into my 60 months) and my credit card debt is paid off (I'm 3/4 paid off, it's slow but it's getting there each month) I'm sure my rating will improve and then maybe we can add my name like you said. Maybe after I get a ring? <IMG src=""http://www.xsorbit.com/httpimages/wink.gif""> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><STRONG>Hey B, this is great! Good for you! I mean, you'll be closer to the ones you love, and you'll save money too. Of course, this is a big move (pardon the pun) so you have to be sure of what you're doing. It's ok to freak out a bit. But think things through, don't rush them, and if you think that moving in together is the right thing for all of you right now, then go for it!</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000><FONT color=#000099>Oh believe me, I've thought about a lot of things over the past 24 hours. <BR><BR>When the talk about getting a house started picking up again, I wasn't sure where I might fit into their lives once they moved. I've even had dreams about Pat getting a house without telling me, moving everything in, and then inviting me over just to see my reaction. Of course, I woke up pissed beyond belief but when I told him about it, he laughed and said he pretty much had the same dream about 3 weeks prior to that. Aside from that and talking about where he might want to move, we haven't talked about it.<BR><BR>So, when he asked me to go with him when the time came, it was a shock also a little relieving. I probably would've brought up the, ""So, where do I fit in your life now?"" question; it just might've taken me a little time to work up the nerve to ask it. It was a big, six week fight with myself to tell him that I loved him, so I'm sure it would've been just as long to work up the nerve to ask him that question as well. </FONT><BR><BR><STRONG>Does this mean that I can finally send you the blender now? <IMG src=""http://www.xsorbit.com/httpimages/grin.gif""> </STRONG></FONT></P>

"event","<P>Well, there's been talk about Pat finding a house for himself and the boys for almost a year now and as of this week, he's finally taken a head dive into it. He took off Monday and Tuesday of this week to get things started (made calls and drove around to look at neighborhoods). Monday was a phone-ringing-off-the-hook day for him and he couldn't wait to get out of the house for a little while (hockey game; they lost). </P>
<P>So, on the drive to his game, I asked him how things went and what he's thinking and he tells me but only after I pry it out of him. Then I tell him, ""I forsee longer drives in my future."" He looks over at me and says, ""Huh?""&nbsp; I want to sigh but don't, so I say, ""It already takes me an hour to get from work to your parents place and about 20-25 mintues from my house to there. I don't think you'll be moving any closer to where I am so I think I'll be driving more."" He didn't say anything after that, so I just turned my head and looked out the window since we were almost there.</P>
<P>That was Monday night.</P>
<P>Yesterday,&nbsp;after I get out of work, I send him&nbsp;a text message and ask him how things went during the day. He text's me back, telling me he'll call after dinner (which ends up being around 8pm). So, we talk some about the headway he's made on the loan approvals. So far, he's been told that he's qualified for a $100,000 FHA loan . . . as well as a $130,000 30-year fixed rate loan . . . from two different companies. </P>
<P>We talk some more and then he tells me that he was trying to show&nbsp;the boys&nbsp;a house on their way back from Ms. Daisy's and couldn't remember where it was. He also had a talk with them about how things will change when they move. Buying the necessities will take presidence over smaller ""want"" items that the boys want. This means going to WCA for skateboarding, going to movies, Of course, this was met with, ""So, what you're saying is we're gonna be poor."" This is their standard line when Pat tells them that he can't afford to buy them everything they want. I told Pat, ""If they say that, then say, 'Yes, we're poor when it comes to buying things that none of us need.'""&nbsp;&nbsp;<A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_ZSYYYYYYYYUS"" target=_blank></A>&nbsp;He won't of course, but hey, I'd have no problem doing it.</P>
<P>Then he tells me about houses he was looking at online and how many rooms and whatnot and the prices. Then I tell him that just because it says 2 bedrooms doesn't mean that's all there is. There could very well be&nbsp;a room that could be converted into a bedroom. Then he says, ""So what do you have to say about all of this? You've been kinda quiet about all of it."" I paused and then said, ""Well, you never asked me. I'm not going to just assume anything and put my nose where it doesn't belong."" He laughed and said, ""I know but I was thinking that if you could come with me it might be easier for all of us and you could get out of your mom's house too."" </P>
<P>I kinda balked at that because this is the first he's ever hinted at it. Then he says, ""When you said all that stuff yesterday about having a longer drive I didn't know what you were thinking."" I laughed and said, ""That's because you never asked me."" </P>
<P>We talk about it some more and then he says, ""Well, you still haven't answered my question."" I sighed and said, ""I'd like to but I don't want to hurt your chances [because of my credit rating] of getting a better deal."" </P>
<P>So, basically it all comes down to my saying ""Yes"" to moving in with him and the boys. <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_ZSYYYYYYYYUS"" target=_blank><IMG alt=Spinnng src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_13_16v.gif"" border=0></A></P>"

<P><FONT color=#000099>Well, the talking has started again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Saturday night Marty &amp; Barb start bringing it up again and my mom is hinting at wanting to give Pat things in our house because she wants to get rid of it in order to get new stuff. Mom's literally trying to shove stuff off on him. <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_ZSYYYYYYYYUS"" target=_blank><IMG alt=Lol src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/29/29_1_9.gif"" border=0></A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Pat's talking about taking 1-3 days off so he can go and talk to some Mortage people because the first guy he talked to was no help. He&nbsp;said, ""So, how much can you afford?"" Which was kinda stupid...aren't they supposed to tell you how much you can afford? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Anyway, like I said . . . talk about getting a house has started again and I'm trying my best to let him know that limiting himself to one school district isn't a good idea. He's very concerned about moving to an area that'll make his drive to work longer (it's only 30 minutes right now). But, I keep telling him, ""But what if everything that's available in the area you want is out of your price range?"" </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>So, we'll see how things go I suppose.</FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>&nbsp;I know it's been a while since I updated this particular journal, but, here it is!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>The boys are finished with school and they're on their 2nd week of vacation now. They spend Tuesday-Thursday with Ms. Daisy (a friend of their Aunt Sheila) since both of them refuse to go to day camp, especially Tyler (12). And, of course, anything Tyler won't do, Conner (9) won't do either.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>This past Saturday, we all attended a birthday party for my sister's nephew (her husband's nephew) and while we were having dinner, I looked over at Tyler and said, ""Oh my God Tyler, you're getting leg hair!""&nbsp; He kinda looked at me and blushed a little bit but said, ""Yeah,"" with a little smile. Then Pat said, ""Then you'll get arm pit hair and facial hair and ..."" he couldn't finish because he was laughing. </FONT><FONT color=#00008b size=3>Tyler blushed a bit but laughed his butt off at the idea of facial hair on himself. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>I'm 5' 4/5"" and he's gaining (Pat is 6'1"" but the boys' mother is 5'2"") so who knows how much more he has to grow. So, the onset of puberty is definately on course with Tyler. Pat said, ""Pretty soon he'll be stinkin'!""&nbsp; I laughed and said, ""It's already started. His hockey clothes are disgusting.""&nbsp; Pat nodded in agreement and Tyler gave me a little pout&nbsp; but then grinned.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>I'm beginning to think that maybe a little bit of this puberty is rubbing off on Conner. Or maybe it's the fact that Tyler is kinda ""leaving him behind"" as he plays with his friends? I'm not sure if it's one or the other or a little bit of both. All I know is, Conner's a shy kid and he's spending more and more time at home, by himself, when Tyler is down at the corner or two houses down playing with friends. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>It's not that Conner doesn't know these kids so he doesn't go an play with them. I think it's a bit of that, ""you're just the younger brother so we don't want you around"" thing. But Conner doesn't really just go away. Mostly, he'll try and act older or badder/like a tough guy and then when the older kids don't buy it, they belittle him and the comes home sulking. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>There aren't many boys on their street that are his age (even though the gap is only 2 year between him and the youngest of the olde rkids) and he doesn't like to play with girls (who are next door and down at the corner; sisters of the boys at the corner). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>We try and tell him that if he plays nice with the rest of the boys then maybe he'll be more accepted by them and they won't shoo him him so fast. But, he gets angry when they ignore him so then he thinks that if he acts up, they'll pay attention to him and then forget that they were ignoring him and then he can join in. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>You can only tell him so many times that what he's doing isn't working but he won't listen to Pat or myself either when we try and offer suggestions. So, we're kind of at an impass right now but hopefully as the summer goes on, Conner'll get better at this.</FONT></P>"

"event","<P>I hadn't realized that it's been this long since I've updated this particular journal (over 2 months).</P>
<P>Anyway, I thought I'd update and say that I survived Christmas and that the boys got me a gift this year (body wash and body lotion Reindeer Set&nbsp;from Bath &amp; Body Works). </P>
<P>New Year's Eve we stayed in and celebrated with the boys, Barb and Sheila &amp; John.</P>
<P>January was pretty uneventful and February, so far, has been pretty good as well.</P>
<P>Pat and I made another Super Bowl bet, and I lost (again). **sigh**</P>
<P>Valentine's Day, we're both pretty poor so we didn't go out. He cooked dinner (steaks) and we got each other cards and watched a bit of TV. </P>
<P>One small thing has been happening though. Every Friday &amp; Saturday night I sleep over and then head home after breakfast. It's quite a nice thing and allows for a little more time to spend with Pat without me having to drive home in the middle of the night. It also lets the boys have more time with me in the morning so we can get used to each other.</P>
<P>In April, Barb will be heading to Florida for a month so Pat's going to need help getting the boys off to school so there's a possibility of me staying at the house for&nbsp;almost a month (I'm still going to Indianapolis for 5 days in April) to help him out. Since my work schedule has changed (I have to work 8:30-5:00) it kind of works out with the boys schedules so Tyler isn't alone for very long in the morning (if he's alone at all) and I can drop Conner off at S.A.C. in the mornings for about 30 minutes before school starts.&nbsp; So, we'll see how that develops.</P>
<P>For now, that's about it.</P>"

"event","<P>It kinda started on Saturday night...</P>
<P>Pat, Conner and I were the only ones at the house and Pat was going to order pizza. So, Conner and I started to play a new&nbsp;game that I&nbsp;had gotten for my b-day (Hoopla). We continued to play while Pat left to pick up the pizza. We finished just after he returned.</P>
<P>Conner was lovin' it....so much that we played the game 5 times in a row (4 times after dinner). Then, it was about 9pm and he needed to go to bed. He wasn't happy about that, but I told him that I was tired and that if we had time tomorrow, we'd play. He still didn't like it, but he went up to bed.</P>
<P>Then, Sunday was so crazy and we were in and out of the house most of the day....we didn't have time. He went up to bed upset. Before I left, I went upstairs to tell him I'd come over early on Monday so we could play before Pat's game....and he was passed out. So, I told Pat to tell him when he got home from school.</P>
<P>I brought over 2 different games (Sequence and Rummykub) and the four of us ended up playing Sequence (Conner &amp; I vs Pat &amp; Tyler). Conner and I kicked butt. </P>
<P>Then, on Tuesday....when we got back from Conner's practice, he asked if we could play and I told him if he finished his homework and got ready for bed, I'd have time for 1 game before I had to go home. </P>
<P>So,&nbsp; I sat on the couch and read my book while he did his thing and Pat made lunches. After he was done he sat down on the couch next to me, asked me what I was reading and then asked me what it was about. I told him (vaguely) and he said, ""Oh, cool. Can we play now?""&nbsp;Tyler was downstairs working on some kind of report and wouldn't be finished for awhile, so we played without him (just Conner and I). We played Sequence (since that's the only one I brought in with me) and he kicked my butt! </P>
<P>Then, I left to go home.</P>
<P>Last night, it was Tyler's game and I told them, if they wanted to play, they had to behave on the way home, get their homework done and be ready for bed.&nbsp;That didn't happen...they fought after we stopped at CVS so Pat could pick up some bread &amp; milk. </P>
<P>Conner mentioned something about ""Oh great, if you [he meant Tyler] don't stop, then we won't be able to play that game when we get home!""</P>
<P>I told them, ""No, it's too late for that. You both blew it a minute ago when you couldn't keep your hands to yourselves.""</P>
<P>Conner yelled, ""Great Tyler!"" and then hit him.&nbsp; </P>
<P>When we got back to the house, I gathered up my things and prepared to go home. Pat asked me why I was leaving and I said, ""I was only going to stay [tonight] so we could get in one game with the boy and since they messed that up, I'm going home.""</P>
<P>I think Pat would've liked for me to stay a little longer, but I told the boys that if they didn't behave, we weren't going to play and that I'd go home. So, I thought that keeping my word [to the boys that night] was more important than having me hover around Pat while he got things ready for the next day.</P>
<P>But, even with all the negative things, one good thing has come out of it:&nbsp;Conner and I are getting along much better now. The night the two of us (Conner and I) played, he brought down Monopoly and asked me if I'd play with him. That was a first. But, I told him that I didn't have a lot of time, so I'd go and get Sequence out of my car and we'd play one game. </P>
<P>They both (Conner &amp; Tyler) want to do things with Pat and I, but there's not much they can do. But when it comes to games (board and card) it's something we can find that we all can do together. I know they crave it...they ask all the time.&nbsp;So, by trying to involve them in small activities with Pat and I . . . I think that's a move in the right direction. </P>"

<P><FONT size=2><FONT color=darkblue>They're both&nbsp;on, constantly, about going to ""the store"" so dad or grandma can buy them something. </FONT><FONT color=darkblue>This ranged from a skateboard (which he ended up getting from grandma but did not deserve) for Tyler to these ""AirSoft"" guns {they shoot small plastic pellets} that they both want because the boys who live on the street all have them. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=darkblue size=2>It was the AirSoft guns first . . . so I've heard talk about these things for almost 5 weeks now. The neighbor boys to the right got theirs first and of course all the other boys on the street flocked over to play with them. The day I pulled into the driveway and saw&nbsp;Brian (neighbor boy) shooting at empty pop cans, I knew we all were in for a new ""thing"" the boys would be wanting. I was not looking forward to it. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>As I predicted, the asking started about 2 hours later. It wouldn't have been so bad if the asking had been once or twice a day . . . but it turned into 5-10 times a day and sometimes they'd argue with Pat for 15 minutes and not let the conversation drop. I so wanted to say something, but I didn't; I kept my mouth shut.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=darkblue size=2>The asking for these things went on for two weeks . . . then one of the boys at the end of the street got a new skateboard. He told Tyler that it was a ""real skateboard, not a fake one like you can find at K-Mart or Target.""&nbsp; I know what you're thinking because I thought it too, ""What's a <EM>fake</EM> skateboard?"" According to the kids, a <EM>real skateboard</EM> is one in which you buy the wheels, trucks and board/plank separate and then put it together. Of course, these <EM>real skateboards</EM> aren't cheap. The boards start at $20-ish and go up....the same for the wheels and trucks (the parts that the wheels are attached to and then attached to the bottom of the board). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>So, the asking for a new skateboard (a real one!) started and lasted for about two weeks. The AirSoft guns were quickly forgotten with the newest obsession.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=darkblue><FONT size=2>About a week and a half later, Tyler ended up with a $150-ish skateboard from grandma.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_ZSzeb02822"" target=_blank><FONT size=2><IMG alt=""Shock 2"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_6_103.gif"" border=0></FONT></A><FONT size=2>&nbsp; Pat was not pleased. </FONT><A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_ZSzeb02822"" target=_blank><FONT size=2><IMG alt=Pissed src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_2_211.gif"" border=0></FONT></A><FONT size=2>The kicker...by the time he got home and found out about this . . . the wheels were already marked up and the board had scuffs on it; it wasn't returnable at that point (he had called on it already). </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=darkblue><FONT size=2>Pat, once again, told his mother to stop buying the boys things. It doesn't sit well with him and it won't sit well with the other grandkids either when they find out (and it ticked off grandpa too, big time). Hopefully, she'll stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_ZSzeb02822"" target=_blank><FONT size=2><IMG alt=""Fingers Crossed"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/12_3_46.gif"" border=0></FONT></A><FONT size=2>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>So, now (last week)&nbsp;that Tyler has the new skateboard and is out on it constantly he and Conner have gone back to their whiney ""I want!"" mode. Pat wasn't putting up with it and as a result, they&nbsp;have both started to act up, severely.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>Sassy back-talk, rude behavior, fighting and hitting each other constantly, etc. They can't be left alone (unless they're with friends, then they don't fight) because they can't keep their hands off each other. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>Last Wednesday&nbsp;we all were on our way home from one of Tyler's&nbsp;and after getting about 10 minutes down the road, all hell broke loose. Tyler was throwing Conner's pencils out the window and smacking him with a&nbsp;ruler. I took the ruler when Conner yanked it away from Tyler; but it didn't stop there. The yelling and screaming just went up in volume. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>Pat pulled the car over at the next parking lot. Needless to say, it wasn't pretty and my head started to throb. After a minute or two, Pat put the car in gear and we were on our way again. Ten minutes later, Pat almost had to pull the car over again. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b><FONT size=2>He took Tyler's skateboard from him for two days (locked it up in his car) and forbid them from going back out to play&nbsp;for the rest of the evening (it was 6pm). They both whined and complained about that and started up again and stomped into the house.&nbsp; </FONT><A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001_ZSzeb02822"" target=_blank><FONT size=2><IMG alt=""Stop The Insanity"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/23/23_29_111.gif"" border=0></FONT></A></P></FONT>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>Pat asked me why I put up with it and why I stick around. I told him, ""Unless they improve, I won't be back on Friday for anything but your sister's birthday.""&nbsp; He hugged me and told me that he understood. We said our good night's and I went home.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>We ended up going to dinner that Friday for his sister's birthday and Tyler was being a little crapper. He was moody and wouldn't talk to anyone. He then started back up with the AirSoft thing again and wouldn't stop. I think the week ended up getting to both of them because they were both quiet on the way home and went to bed with relatively little problem.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>The rest of the (this past) weekend was a semi-nightmare. The boys spent the day with Pat's other sister and ended up spending the night. Sunday, however, was horrid. I can't even begin to know where to start on that. Let's just say that Conner was so horrible it was almost scary. I left for home at 8pm that night.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>Monday night, Pat had a late game and the boys were acting up, again. They had to be dropped off to where grandma was currently at since she wasn't due to be home until a little after 9pm and we couldn't take them with us (we wouldn't be back to the house until almost midnight). Needless to say, we finally got them ready to go and left the house 10 minutes after Pat wanted to leave. By the time we got back to the house (it was 11:40pm) and Conner was still awake. Pat went up and said good night to them and by the time he came back down, I was ready for bed and trying to sleep (getting up at 5:30am is too early for me to go back home so I crashed there). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>Yesterday, the boys were so-so except for the ride to Conner's game. Tyler was being a little snot and I could feel a headache coming on. Ten minutes into the ride, Tyler brings up the AirSoft guns again. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>It goes on and on and on and on and on and on . . . I thought a broken record was playing.&nbsp; He kept it up during the game as well. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b><FONT size=2>On the way home, both boys were trying to convince Pat that he had promised to buy them the things. Pat wasn't biting; he refused to talk about it any more. <FONT color=#00008b>Pat has told them that he won't buy these things for them because he feels that they don't need them and it's just an accident waiting to happen. Thankfully, grandma and grandpa agree. So, unless he caves in (and I see him starting to) the boys won't be getting these non-toys. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>This didn't stop the boys from talking any more; they kept right on talking and wouldn't stop. I couldn't take it any more. I chimed in.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>I asked them both if they knew why their dad didn't want them to have these things. They answered me and then went right into, ""But so-and-so have them and their mom thinks it's okay!""&nbsp; I almost hurt my eyes due to rolling them so hard.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>I told them, ""The&nbsp;Bolland's have their own rules for their kids. Your dad has rules for you and they're not going to mach what they&nbsp;have. Your dad has told you why he doesn't want you to have these things. You have to accept that."" &nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>From the backseat I heard Conner mutter, ""No, we don't."" and then it was quite for the rest of the trip home. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>I should've said, ""You may not like it, but you have to accept it. It's part of growning up and acting responsible."" Tyler is constantly talking about being treated like an older kid, but won't give on his attitude. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>When we got back to the house things were okay for about 30 minutes. They were all washed up for bed and we were going to start <STRONG>Miracle</STRONG> (hockey movie) and then finish it the next night. We didn't get past the first 15 minutes before Conner had a hissy fit. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=2>I got up from the couch, put my jacket on and said good night to Pat. Conner took off because he knew he was going to be in trouble (they always get a ""talking to"" when I leave early like this) and Pat walked me to the door where we said our good night's and I left.</FONT></P>"

"event","<P>I've&nbsp;had a <EM>semi-shocking</EM> moment recently and I completely forgot to write it down. </P>
<P>About two weeks ago, I almost saw Conner&nbsp;&amp; Brian (and a friend of his) almost get run over by a car on my way over to the house one evening. I was about 30 feet away from turning onto the court and I could see another car coming from the opposite direction so I slowed down and turned on my blinker. About 10 seconds after that, I saw Conner (riding the bike) and Brian (being pulled from behind while wearing rollerblades) crusing down the court . . . heading straight for the oncoming car. The car didn't see them, it was dusk and I barely saw the boys myself, and wasn't slowing down. I rolled down my window and yelled at the boys to stop but they didn't. I honked my horn and the car slowed as it approached the court entrance and swerved to the right and avoided the boys. </P>
<P>I moved my car up towards the boys, rolled down the window to ask them what the hell they were thinking. I all but yelled at them and asked them why they didn't stop&nbsp;and got a bunch of (almost) 9-year-old ""blah blah blah"" from each of them. Conner eventually told me that he couldn't have stopped in time (he was peddling too fast) and he would've crashed into the street and hurt himself. </P>
<P>I asked him why he didn't steer his bike towards the grass then and he said, ""Because I didn't want to. Besides, the car wasn't any where near us!"" and then the two of them took off again. </P>
<P>I was flabbergasted! I know that he actually thought the car wouldn't have hit him or Brian.</P>
<P>I tried to shake it off and drove to the house. When I pulled into the driveway I took a moment to calm down before getting out of my car. By then Conner and Brian were back on the street near the house and goofing around. I told Conner and Brian that since it was getting dark out that maybe it was a good idea for them to come inside. Of course they ignored me and took off again.</P>
<P>Pat was messing around on his mom's computer in the living room an I told him what happened. Then I told him to call them both in and talk to them because they were at the end of the street again, messing around.</P>
<P>Pat called them both inside, and questioned them about what happened. When Conner tried to tell him that the car was too far away I stopped him. He didn't like that and got really upset. Again, I asked him why he didn't steer off towards the grass and he gave the same excuse. I reminded him and Brian that their little bodies wouldn't make it out very well if the car had hit them; that we'd all be at the hospital now waiting to see if they would be okay.</P>
<P>They just ignored me and Conner started yelling at Pat. I couldn't take it any more so I went downstairs. I was pacing around and Pat finally came downstairs a minute later. </P>
<P>I heard the front door open again and I asked him who was going outside. He told me that all of them (Tyler and Grant too) were going outside. Oh, I almost lost it. I couldn't believe he was letting any of them out when you could barely see outside. </P>
<P>He said, ""They'll be back in, in a moment anyway, so there's no harm."" He walked over to me and kissed the side of my head and&nbsp;apologized for putting me in ""mom mode"" as soon as I arrived. <BR><BR>That . . . was a semi-schocker! <IMG alt="""" src=""http://www.robkamphausen.com/ubbthreads/images/graemlins/confused.gif""> </P>"

"event","<P><FONT size=4>I'd love to have Pat take everything that's ""fun"" oriented out of their room and leave them with their beds and school items. Then, let them spend all their time (when they're not having a meal or doing homework) up there and seeing how it really feels to ""have nothing."" <BR><BR>That is the biggest thing with them. They'll actually stand there and say directly to Pat, ""So, what you're saying is that we're poor and we can't afford to have it!"" Or they'll say, ""My GoooooooooooooD! We can't have anything!/We don't have anything!""&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Pat's not poor, but things are tight where money is concerned and the boys just don't understand. They still have no concept of money and how things add up on a daily/weekly/monthly/yearly basis. <BR><BR>Trying to reason with an 11 year old and a soon to be 9 year old is impossible. I try my best, since I seem to be the only one who can talk to the boys without raising my voice at all (Pat's guilty of this, and tends to be ""fast to yell""). I can get through to them for a little while, but it just never seems to stick.<BR><BR>I think they need something drastic to make it stick. Being in Jr. High (Tyler) and still whining and acting like a 5 year old isn't acceptable and doesn't bode well for the future. I worry about him getting into a lot of trouble down the line because he can't take a ""No"" from anyone without complaining, a lot.</FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>As of last week, week #1 for the boys, Conner hates his teacher. ""She's mean!"" he says. Supposedly, she makes them ""do a lot of work"" and they're not allowed to have Trapper Keepers this year because they won't fit in the desks they have in their room. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>It seems that Tyler is still having a problem being organized and turning in forms to/from his teachers to Pat. Last week, the first week of classes, Tyler misplaced two different forms (one for Gym and one for Band) and cannot participate until both have been turned in to the teacher.&nbsp;Monday night he was trying to convince Pat&nbsp;to just write a note with all kinds of medical information on it so he could participate in his Gym class. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>We tried to explain to Tyler that the school sends home the same forms for everyone for a reason and that having Pat write a substitue probably wouldn't work.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>At this point, Tyler was convinced that he'd be banned from Gym for the rest of the semester and that it was all Pat's fault. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>Later, as I'm helping Pat get the boys lunches ready, I see a bunch of papers at the bottom of Tyler's backpack. I get them out and see that they're some kind of <EM>worksheet</EM> for three different classes. The folders he was given to keep these kinds of papers were empty (thus the papers being on the bottom of the bag under the books, where they were shoved).&nbsp; I smoothed out the papers and clipped them to the bunch of folders with a gentle reminder (complete with smiley faces) for Tyler to keep his papers in the folders so they'd stay nice &amp; neat. I also suggested that maybe he should label each folder with the class &amp; teacher name to help him keep his classes straight. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>I don't know if he took my suggestions or not, but I'll find out on Friday, or tonight when we talk.</FONT></P>

"event","<P>Tyler was away for most of the weekend. Originally, I was going to take Tyler &amp; Conner out shopping for Pat's birthday (to have them pick out something to give to him from them, with me paying). </P>
<P>However, Tyler's friend Hunter invited him over for Saturday and most of Sunday (which turned into all of Sunday) so it was just Conner &amp; I on our little shopping expedition early Saturday afternoon.</P>
<P>Fastforward to about 9PM on Sunday evening. Barb, Pat &amp; I are sitting down to enjoy a game of Phase 10 when Barb asks Tyler if he has any money left over (she gave him some for the air show so he wouldn't have to mooch off of Hunter's father). He proudly said that he had $12 dollars left . . . and then asked if he could keep it all. </P>
<P>When Barb said, ""How about you keep $2 and give me back $10."" </P>
<P>Oh, well, Tyler didn't like that and proceeded to pout and get very mouthy. He was very rude to Barb and proceeded to slam around things. </P>
<P>I probably shouldn't have said anything but I couldn't help it. I called out his name and said, very calmly, ""Tyler, she asked for it back. You shouldn't have to be asked more than once."" </P>
<P>Well, he didn't like that. He was standing just outside the bathroom door and he slammed the door to the bathroom and stayed in there for a few minutes. When he came out, he went upstairs and then came back down with it. He walked over to the table and slammed the money down in front of Barb and yelled, ""Here's your stupid money"" and then ran upstairs again. </P>
<P>Earlier, he tried to justify his keeping the money, ""I could've told you that I spent it all and just kept it!""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We figured that he had ""big plans"" for that $12 and didn't want to give it back. </P>
<P>We&nbsp;didn't see him again all night.</P>"

<P><FONT color=#000099>Now, Pat only has 9 more vacation days left for the year (he's used up 11 already) so taking another full day will kind of hurt. He already has to take a half-day to take Conner to the doctor at 1:30pm.</FONT></P>

Got to spend some ""sleep time"" with Pat . . . i.e. tried to get him relaxed enough so he'd fall asleep. I rubbed and stroked his back for about an hour but he was still too wound up to sleep. So, I just cuddled into his back and before you know it, he was out. However, when I moved to get up, he woke up. So I said my ""Good night, love you"" he was awake enough to ask me questions about the next day. **sigh** Next time I guess.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#333399><STRONG><FONT size=4><U>Friday Evening</U>:</FONT></STRONG> I stopped to pick up a double cheeseburger for Pat so he could eat something before we left for Augie's (Jen &amp; Clint's vow ceremony). The drive down was so smooth, it was almost scary. There was hardly any traffic on South I-75 . . . I thought I was driving in the Twilight Zone. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#333399>The ceremony was short and cute and the sun was just perfect.Very nice vows were exchanged. It was very nice. <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><IMG alt=Hearts src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/228.gif"" border=0></A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#333399>Also . . . since the boys were away at a ""24+ hour sleep over"" for one of the boys down the street, we&nbsp;had no worries about getting home at a certain time. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#333399>It was an interesting night, to say the least, and since I was driving, Pat was able to let loose and really enjoy himself. So much so, that by the time we move inside (it got cold outside after 9pm) he couldn't&nbsp;keep his hands away from my backside. He kept trying to spank me and as a result, the top of my butt was quite warm by 12:30am or so . . . and he got caught (usually he's sneaky about things like that) by more than one person and was told to, ""Wait 'til you get home for that stuff!"" <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><IMG alt=""Laughing Baby"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/15/15_5_7.gif"" border=0></A>&nbsp;Pat also had a hard time keeping his hand from the inside of my skirt . . . the backside of it anyway. His hands kept traveling down the back of my skirt to play with my underwear or to&nbsp;try and smack a bit lower on my butt. Once, when I told him, ""Hey now, you better be careful,"" he sat down on a nearby stool and sulked . . . just like Conner does. It was so cute. I went over, stood between his legs and put his face between my hands and said, ""Aww poor baby..."" and kissed him on the lips quickly. Before you knew it, hands were on my butt and he's trying to gyrate while still on the stool! <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><IMG alt=""Shock 2"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_6_103.gif"" border=0></A>&nbsp; </FONT><FONT color=#333399>I also got quite a few, albeit, quick open-mouthed kisses as well.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#333399>I tell ya . . . when the man drinks a little bit, he's sure not stingy with the affection. And I have to say, I loved every minute of it. It's always nice to get the ego stroked in public now and again. <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><IMG alt=""Couple 2"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/227.gif"" border=0></A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#333399>We left around 1:30am and were back at the house a little after 2:00am. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#333399>He was in a big rush because before I knew it, he was kicking off his boxer-briefs and diving into the bed totally nekkid. When I said, ""kicking off"", I mean ""kicking off"". I think I just stood there and watched him. It was amazing. I had never seen him do such a thing before. It was amazing. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#333399>Needless to say . . . I decided to throw things off a bit and climbed into bed on the opposite side. He wrapped his arms around me and we slept face-to-face with his chin just above my boobs. A little while later, I got hot, so I tried to move so I could lay flat on my back, but he wasn't having any of that. He made this strange, ""uh-uh!"" sound and kinda burried his face between my boobs and then fastened his mouth onto the side of my right boob. When I tried to pull away, he started to suck on my skin. I moved back in so he'd let up, and he did. I waited a moment and then tried again . . . but he sucked and pulled this time. Oye! I tried it three more times before I gave up. He just wasn't letting me move. Now, I've never nursed a baby, but I tell ya, he sure was acting like one . . . only he wasn't aiming for the nipple! <IMG alt=""Laughing Baby"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/15/15_5_7.gif"" border=0></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#333399>Some time later that night I got up for my normal ""middle of the night bathroom break"" and when I came back, I climbed back into bed on the normal side (for his bed, not mine) and went back to sleep. Some time around 7:30am I got up to go to the bathroom again and about an hour later, Pat started playing with me to get some action going. Needless to say, Morning Sex is a fantastic way to start a Saturday. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#333399><STRONG><FONT size=4><U>Saturday</U>:</FONT></STRONG> We finally got up around 9:30am or so and had breakfast about 30 minutes later and then I headed home to shower and do some more things at home before I'd come back over later. </P>
<P>It was in the shower that I realized that Pat had left a present for me on my right boob . . . a slight hickey. Oye! I kinda chuckled and decided that I was going to rub it in to him later that he gave me a hickey . . . he's always told me that they're nasty and he doesn't give them. </P>
<P>The day was kinda slow. His parents were away at the McGill's and Sheila came back to the house a little before dinner (we at around 5pm) and then John arrived a couple of hours later.</P>
<P>The boys were hardly home the entire day . . . they still played down the street, but we weren't complaining. We finally got our things ready and were off for the fireworks a little after 9pm. The boys decided to drive with Sheila and John (which was very surprising). But when we arrived to the spot to watch the fireworks, we were informed that the boys had to be split up on the way back to the house, or ride with us . . . they were acting like little shits apparently. **sigh**</P>
<P>The boys couldn't keep their mouths shut the entire time and I was just exhausted. I laid down on the blanket and waited for the show to start. Pat kept checking on me to make sure I wasn't asleep but by the time the show&nbsp; was over, I was ready for bed. Pat commented on it later when we went down to go to sleep. </P>
<P>We cuddled the entire time and I went home very late/early in the morning. </P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=4><U>Sunday</U>:</FONT></STRONG> A semi-slow day and Pat &amp; the boys were coming to pick me up on the way to Sam &amp; Stephanie's place in Lapeer for a small 4th of July party. The boys were surprisingly well behaved on the ride up there ('bout 45 mintues) and at Sam's place too. <BR><BR>We stopped at Kevin &amp; Barb's place to check out the animals (sheep, goats and horses) and the boys got a kick out of the sheep because their ""Baa!"" sounded like&nbsp;a human trying to immitate the sound. <BR><BR>On the way home, Tyler stuck his head out the window and freaked Pat &amp; I out . . . and then Conner tried to do the same thing. I think Pat almost pulled the car over to throttle them both . . .</P>
<P>When we got to our house, we pulled up behind mom &amp; Chuck and Ron &amp; Brenda (uncle &amp; aunt). We chatted for a few minutes then they headed home. Mom invited the boys in the back yard to see the fish (Koi) and then they were investigating the big pond and discovered that there were tons of frogs around. </P>
<P>I followed Pat &amp; the boys to the house in my car. Pat pulled in to one place that was selling fireworks and bought some for the boys. We lit them off for the boys and then were in bed around 1am after&nbsp;playing a game of cards with Barb.</P>
<P>Again, Pat kicked off his boxerbriefs and dove into bed. Again, more cuddling all night. For some reason, it was extra warm down there and even the fan wasn't helping. I was basically laying there, completely uncovered trying to get some cool air on my back. And then, Pat starts playing with my butt. I have no idea what time it is, sometime around 5:30am or so maybe, and I'm groggy and semi-aroused. He keeps this up for about 10 minutes and before you know it, oh yeah, I'm rarin' to go and he stops. </P>
<P>So, I figure, fair is fair, and then I go to work on him. I get him very worked up to the point where he's making sounds; usually he's pretty quite when we're fooling around.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm all worked up and sweaty and comepletely exhausted before I'm anywhere near done, so I climb off him and invite him to have his way with me . . . and it works. <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><IMG alt=""She Devil"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/15/15_1_65v.gif"" border=0></A>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So, I head home around 6:30 or so. It was a glorious morning until the cramps kicked in and I felt like I was gonna die. <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><IMG alt=""Dramatic Death"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/15/15_6_25.gif"" border=0></A></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=4><U>Monday</U>:</FONT></STRONG> I spent most of the morning in bed trying to relax and over come the cramps an nausia from the beginning of my period. By the time Pat called around 1:00pm and I told him what was up, he said, ""Did we kick start it this morning or what?"" and then laughed. I said, ""Sure, laugh when I feel like I'm gonna puke my brains out."" He stopped and said, ""Are you okay."" I paused a minute and then said, ""Yeah, I'm fine; I took some drugs so I'm waiting for them to kick in. I'll be fine.""</P>
<P>And I was much better about 90 minutes later. It was a pretty uneventful day. I arrived around 4pm and it was just he and I and we spent most of the day watching TV on the couch together and I ribbed him smore more about the ""hickey"" on my boob and he finally admitted that, maybe he did it, but he sure didn't remember doing it. *hehe*</P></FONT>"

I have Friday off (for the holiday) so I might watch the boys for a little while before they head to the party (which is down the street) and then go home to get ready for Jen & Clint's Vow Renewal Ceremony (7pm) later that night and then come back to the house. 

So, as a result, I might end up staying at the house on Thursday night (so I can be there when the boys get up).</P>
<P><STRONG>Next Week:</STRONG> My sister's wedding is on the 10th and Pat &amp; I will be leaving for that on the 9th. As of yesterday, I found out that the boys will be joining Barb &amp; Marty for an entire week while Marty is out of town on a job (they'll be staying at a hotel). So, they'll be leaving some time on the 8th and I'll be staying at the house with Pat because we'll be leaving in the morning on the 9th and back on the 11th sometime in the late afternoon/early evening. </P>
<P><STRONG>The Following Week:</STRONG> The boys will still be with Barb &amp; Marty so the house will be quite empty and my own house will be very odd (Ivane won't be there any more). Since the house will be quite empty, I'm going to try and plant the seed/idea into Pat's brain that maybe I can stay over a few nights during the week so we can have some ""us time"" while the boys are gone. I'll start that tonight to and from his playoff game. </P>"

"event","<P>I had printed out some stuff for Pat on ""Staying Home Alone"" with the hopes that he'd go over the article with Tyler to show him the kinds of things he needs to be able to do in order to be left home by himself (completely alone) for short periods of time (30 minutes to an hour).</P>
<P>So, as I'm driving down the main road in the subdivision, I see some kids walking down the street and as I get closer, I see that two of them are Tyler and Conner. When I'm almost on top of them I can see these huge tears falling down Conner's face and Tyler has his arm around him as they're walking. I stopped the car quickly&nbsp;and open the door to&nbsp;ask them what's the matter. Before I can get out of the car, Tyler's already reaching for the door behind mine while he tells me that Conner fell off his bike. At this point, I see blood on Conner's elbow and I tell him to get in and I'll drive him home. Tyler tells me that he'll bring Conner's bike home with him later. </P>
<P>Tyler closes the door to the backseat and I reach in the glove box for a napkin to hand to Conner so he can sop up some of the blood on his elbow. </P>
<P>I can tell you that I had no intention of seeing this kind of thing when I was just dropping off some papers at the house for Pat. So, it was a shock to see. </P>
<P>So, as we're going down the street, I ask Conner if he hurt himself anywhere else and he said he scraped his knee a little bit and one palm. I asked him if they were bleeding and he said no. By that time, we were in the drive way and I was calling for Pat as soon as we stepped in the door. </P>
<P>Conner got cleaned up and ended up with a nice 2-inch scrap on the outside of this elbow (which is now scabbed over and he's already picked at it) and flinched at the peroxide I told Pat to dump on the scrape. He did the same to his palm since there was a little dirt in the scrape, but nothing like his elbow. </P>
<P>Conner took off for the main level as soon as that was done and then I asked Pat how Conner's knee was. He said, ""I don't know, is there something wrong with it?"" </P>
<P>I said, ""He told me he scraped it when he fell but that it wasn't bleeding. I didn't get a look at it though."" </P>
<P>Pat said, ""He didn't tell me anything.""</P>
<P>I laughed and then called to Conner to let me look at his knee. It was nothing, just a little bit of skin rolled up and it wasn't even pink or irritated looking. I gave him the okay and he was back outside again. However, since there was no one around, he was back inside and at the counter working on some activity book. </P>
<P>I said my goodbye's to Pat (he was in the middle of making dinner) and then I said goodbye to Conner. He looked up and said, ""Where are you going?"" </P>
<P>""I'm going home. I need to have my dinner and do some things at home,"" I told him. </P>
<P>""Oh, okay,"" he said.</P>
<P>It was an interesting 15 minutes to say the least. </P>"

"event","<P>Well, it looks like the boys will only be going to Camp for two days this week. The family who lives on the corner (just moved in within the last few months) invited the boys to a birthday party for one of their six children for this coming Friday/Saturday. </P>
<P>This invitation came to the house on Thursday evening (last week) and ever since, the boys have been playing over there with the rest of the kids who live on the street. It's amazing to see. When I drove by&nbsp;on Friday on my way to the house, they were all clustered on a corner of the yard, totally engrossed with what the mother was saying. I waved but everyone was completely oblivious. </P>
<P>The boys had already had dinner so they weren't back to the house until . . . get this . . . a little after 9:30pm! Saturday, it was a repeat only they didn't get home until a little after 10pm! Last night, they were home around 9:30pm because the kids had to go in to bed around 9:00pm but they played next door @ David's for another 30 minutes before coming in for the night. </P>
<P>This is the first time, ever, that the boys have ever stayed out of the house for more than a couple of hours at a time. Before this past weekend, the boys were in and out of the house constantly. Other than eatting (and once, they ate down the street) the boys have been outside constantly and it's been amazing. </P>
<P>I, and everyone else, just hope that they continue to get along with the kids on the corner well after this 24-hour birthday party is over. <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><IMG alt=Prayer src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/17/17_1_10.gif"" border=0></A></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#000099>Pat had his last <EM>regular season </EM>game last night (and it was an early game) so I headed over after work for dinner. Things were okay until just after dinner, and then the proverbial shit hit the fan.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Since the boys are finished with school, Pat thought about trying to take the boys with us again but that was before we all found out that parts of the lawn in the backyard were now silver, along with various parts of some trees and the water in the bird bath/fountain. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Marty wasn't happy, especially with the fountain. Apparently, someone took the spray can, and sprayed the water in the fountain silver. Conner and Brian (1 boy from next door) were playing with the paint and Conner professed to not knowing who did it. It was either Brian or himself and he wouldn't admit to anything. The paint was put away somewhere in the garage and someone had to take it out and again, no one would admit to doing it. The boys and their friends just take things out of the garage (tools, pain, etc.) and use them whenever they want without thinking . . . and that's what happened with the paint yesterday.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>So, it was chaos for a little while and I just sat there and let it happen. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Talking to Barb, I found out that Conner had been <EM>Extra Special</EM> (horrible attitude) that morning and it drove her nuts. So, she told Pat that he had to take the boys with us to the game. Pat told her that after the way they behaved the last time, they didn't deserve to go. Marty backed Pat up on that (I ended up coming back to the house with Marty because the boys were driving me crazy and I couldn't take it any more). I told them, ""Let them come along, but don't let them skate since they can't listen to anyone and pack up their gear when they're told to.""</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Pat looked at me like I was crazy. ""Have them go and not let them skate?""</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>""Yes,"" I said. ""If they can't listen and be ready to go when they're asked, then they don't deserve to skate."" </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Marty said he'd write up a contract for the boys to sign with stipulations for going tonight. The words, ""never, never go again"" were used and the boys had to&nbsp;read the contract and explained to Marty what it meant before they signed it. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Pat said, ""I sure hope they know what they're signing...""</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>I kept my mouth shut. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>The night went well, and when Marty and the boys got there (they left are Pat and myself) and were putting on their skates, Marty offered to help Conner with his skates. Conner said, ""No, Bianca tightens my skates."" </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>That was a shocker. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>I was sitting at the top of the bleachers and they were at the bottom, so I said, ""Is that what you want?"" and it was, so I went down there to do it . . . and I got a ""Thank you"" too. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>I think I almost keeled over in shock.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Anyway, it was a good night and I'll add more about what happened after we got back to the house because it was very amusing.</FONT></P>"

So, he had to do the run around (while at work) to get things faxed in on Monday. </FONT><FONT color=#00008b size=3>Since the director didn't get back to him on Friday, he's not able to send the boys in for camp this week as all the days left this week are completely booked (they only take 30 kids a day). </FONT><FONT color=#00008b size=3>However, starting next week the boys will be going Wednesday through Friday, all day long. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>When Pat told the boys that they had to clean out their backpacks so he could throw them in the washer for next week for Camp, Conner said, ""I don't wanna go to Camp!""&nbsp; Pat &amp; I just looked at each other and then Pat said, ""I'm sorry but I haven't found a babysitter, so you have to go to Camp.""</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>Of course Conner started to put (he's 8) and then Pat added, ""This will give you the opportunity to meet other kids.""</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>Conner's very worried about who will be there and asked if the kids would be from his school. Pat told him there might be a few kids from his school. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>I told him that Day Camp would introduce him to new activities and then he can find out (for himself) what he likes and doesn't like. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>But Conner is such a worry wart . . . he's so sure he's going to hate it. He's already telling us that he doesn't want to go swimming because he hates it.

<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>I've been on him, subtly, to get with it and find info on camps or private day care . . . but here it is, June 8th and he still has nothing lined up. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>**sigh**</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>Apparently, back in April, Tyler brought home some kind of paper about the State Assisted camps for single parents . . . and he never gave it to Pat.

<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>The schools in the area are running him in circles and shuffling him off from phone number to phone number.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>Today, I surfed the Web a bit and found (on Michigan's Website)&nbsp;information on&nbsp;some local Day Care providers not too far from his house. They're certified by the State (I printed out their license and any other information the State had on them) and are up to date and still active.

<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>They're all within 10-15 minutes of the house and have restrictions on the age of kids (just the number of kids they'd watch each day). </FONT></P>

"event","Well, things were going well for a Monday.

Pat's team won their hockey game (and he scored 2 goals) and the boys kept themselves occupied the whole time and were going back home with Marty who came to the game to watch.

That last part was the plan as we all left the house.

It all fell apart with 6 minutes left in the game. Tyler and Conner were told to come off the rink (they were skating with a group of kids on the smaller rink) and get ready to go. They chose to ignore Marty and before you know it, Pat's game was over and the boys were just getting off the rink. I went over to see Pat and congratulate him on his two goals before he went into the locker room to change. Conner came over and told Marty he was ready for his bottle of pop now. Marty told him he wasn't going to get one because he took too long to get off the rink. Of course, he assumed that he was going to get one so he skated off all ticked off.

It proceeded to go downhill from there. 

I didn't want to get involved with it all, so I slowly made my way towards the entry way to wait for Pat. I had entertained the thought of telling Pat to stay in the locker room until the coast was clear and the boys had made it out the door with Marty, but I didn't.

As the chaos slowly built, Conner made his way to the same area I was but stayed closer to the door leading outside. When Marty finally made it over he just kinda shook his head at me and I said, ""This happens every single time they come here."" He said, ""Yeah,"" and walked over to Conner. He said something to Conner and Conner replied and included a hand gesture, which might or might not have been his middle finger up in the air; I don't know because I didn't see it. I've never known Marty to exagerate over something like that, so Conner got a smackf upside the back of his head for flipping his grandpa off. 

By this time, Tyler's arrived and threw the bag and his hockey stick down and collapsed onto a chair. 

Marty tries to talk and tell both of the boys why he's upset with them, but they're ignoring him. Now, Pat's come out of the locker room and I just look at him and shake my head sadly. He asks why they're still here and then I tell him that they're both acting like little shits.

Eventually we make it outside and Pat tells the boys that one of them has to ride with grandpa. Tyler immediately says, ""I'm not riding with him!"" and Conner yells, ""I'm not going!"" 

Needless to say, this is causing quite a scene and Pat tells Tyler to knock it off or he'll really be sorry when he gets home. 

They tone it down a bit but they don't let up. They're both back at the car and still complaining. I get inside and buckle myself in and wait. 

Conner climbs in the car and Tyler is right behind him. They're still arguing about who's going to ride with Marty and it's getting louder by the minute. 

I can't take it any more and I don't want to listen to them fight on the way back to the house. So, I take matters into my own hands and say, ""Fine, I'll go ride with grandpa"" and I get out of the car and make my way over to Marty's truck. Pat sees me get out of the car and says, ""What are you doing?""

I told him that I was going to ride back to the house with Marty and he says, ""No, you're not.""

I just looked at him and said, ""Yes, I am"" and went over to the truck, opened the door and got in. I told Marty that we could go and we took off.

We talked about the boys on the way home and then about Barb getting a new car if she turns her Grand Am in before June 1st. 

Pat beat us home and Tim & Sandy were already there (it was their 1st wedding anniversary). Pat was unloading the back of the car and I asked him why they didn't take their stuff in. He told me that he talked to both of them, but mainly Tyler, on the way home and then he said, ""And then he had the balls to ask me if he could go fishing with Tim. Tonight.""  

I tell ya, those two boys have guts for things like that, but when it comes to taking responsibility to do things on their own (brushing teeth, getting dressed, etc.) they can't do anything without help or just assume that someone will tell them ""No"" and sulk before they even contemplate asking anything.

I pick up the boys bag and follow Pat into the house, but before I can get in the door there's Conner. He's coming at me and before I know it, I'm being hugged around my hips and he says, ""I'm sorry we made you leave and go ride with grandpa."" I didn't know what to say, so I just patted him on the head and he took off back inside. 

We made it inside and said hello to Tim and Sandie and I sat myself down at the counter in the kitchen. 

When Tyler came down, Pat was standing to my left and Barb was in front of me on the next stool. I got a hug from him and the same line about being sorry for making me leave and ride with Marty. 

This time, I was semi-ready to say something. I can't remember exactly what I said, but it did involve some of the following, ""I accept your apology"" and ""You need to listen to your dad and grandpa more often so no one gets upset."" 

Now, I don't know if any of that was good or called for, but I'm not going to lie to the kid. 

*sigh*

Boys are so very difficult . . . a lot of the time."

<P><STRONG><FONT size=4><U>Saturday</U>:</FONT></STRONG> Hectic day getting ready for Shelly's wedding. Made it back over to Pat's around 1:30pm to do my hair and finish getting ready. Pat was having a helluva time with the steamer and his jacket so I messed around with that for a while and end up sweating. Ick. We were finally ready to leave, and turns out we rushed ourselves by a good hour and ended up having a couple of drinks at Mr. B's to pass the time. The wedding was very nice and the rain held off just long enough. Pat had a decent time I think; he certainly didn't look too uncomfortable. In fact, he was quite ""naughty"" and cracking quite a few jokes (to me) the entire night. We didn't get to dance (I got entire too sweating from doing the hustle so I was done for the night) but I still had a good time.</P>
<P>When we got back to the house, (adult) people were still up and Sheila's current <EM>boyfriend</EM> was due to come over at any time (it was almost 11pm by then). Pat took a quick detour downstairs and when I went to check on him, he was face down on his bead with his tie off and shirt unbuttoned a little bit. I crawled over and said something teasing to him and kissed him on the face and the next thing I knew I was on the bed and we were kissing. Love it when things like that happen. Then, of course, someone calls for him upstairs so he gets up and then says, ""Woah, down boy!"" and is laughing. I can see his <STRONG>excitement</STRONG> is very evident and I chuckle. I kiss him on the lips and say, ""I'll see ya upstairs"" and flash my dress at him and race out the door.</P>
<P>A little later, we end up playing cards and we're playing until 1am. Pat and I retired and went down to bed . . . and proceeded to have an hour of sexual fun before we're both exhausted. For some reason, my boobs (and nipples) were extremely sensitive and he picked up on that and as a result I almost flew off the bed quite a few times and still had plenty of that left over for the following day (had to tape up the nips because they were extra sensitive and they were driving me crazy).</P>
<P>It was storming pretty bad around 3am and the boys ended up pounding on the door, wanting in because they were scared. By the time Pat got up and found his robe, they were up on the couch with grandpa and were going to stay there. I had gotten dressed and took one look out there and said, ""I'm not driving home in that"" and went back downstairs to go to sleep and Pat followed.</P>
<P>I left for home around 7am with quite a few kisses from Pat before I got out of bed.</P>"

"event","I was watching <i>Extreme Makeover: Home Edition</i> over at Pat's last night. In this episode, the family lost the father to cancer. Well, when the family saw the new oak tree that was planted in the front yard, in memory of their father, most of them cried...and I got a little teary-eyed myself because I can relate.

Well, the boys were sitting at the counter (behind me and the couch) and they both started saying things like, ""Oh, how touching..."" but real smarmy and sarcastic.

Then, later, they show a part of the house that has pictures of all 9 children and the mom & dad and a candle display...the family started crying again...it was all very touching for the last 20 minutes of the show.

At that point, both boys start making fun of the family because they're crying.

I was going to say something to them, but I didn't trust myself, so I just sat there and tried not to cry but that didn't work. So, I went to the bathroom, blew my nose and tried to wash my face. When I came out, I put my shoes on and got my things ready to go home.

I know they have an idea that making fun of others like that isn't right. I do know that they probably don't know anything about my dad, so that's why I didn't say anything (and haven't many times).

As I was gathering my stuff, Pat came up behind me and asked me if they were running me off again. I just shook my head and took for the stairs; he followed me because he could hear me snuffling because my nose was starting to run again.

So, he asks me if it was the tv show or the boys that upset me and I said it was both, but that I was trying really hard not to blame the boys because I'm PMSing very badly.

He didn't say anything while I cried but he said he'd talk to them. Then, Conner came upstairs and said, ""Bye! Bye!"" in a sing-songy, high voice and kept saying it. I didn't want him to see that I was crying so I turned and Pat turned with me and then told Conner he was being very rude and to go upstairs to bed. 

Conner wasn't having it and just stayed on the upper set of (leading to the bedrooms & bathroom) and kept saying ""Bye! Bye!""

So, I said good night to Pat, told him I'd call him tomorrow. He asked me several times if I was going to be okay and that he was sorry I felt so bad. He wiped the tears from my eyes (2 more got out before I could stop it), told me he loved me and that he'll see me tomorrow (hockey game for him).

I was going to stay until 10, but that wasn't going to happen. I was too upset and it was better that I leave....especially with the boys starting to get cranky.

I'll find out what happened when I see Pat later today.

I'm still kinda upset by it and I'm thinking about avoiding going inside the house tonight. That I'll just go over when it's time for him to leave so I don't have to go in."

"event","<P>Well, I worked on the charts for Tyler &amp; Conner again while I was at work today. I tweaked 'em a bit and added in signatures for the boys and Pat. I'll copy &amp; paste it in here tomorrow to show off my work. </P>
<P>So, hopefully he'll be able to use them when he gets them. I mailed them to him since I wasn't sure if his e-mail was up an running or not.&nbsp; I told him about it when I called him tonight. He laughed when I told him that I had worked on the chart and that he'd have it tomorrow or Wednesday. But I told him, I just want to help because the boys are getting out of hand and it won't get better unless he takes steps to correct it and do it now.</P>
<P>So, when he gets the charts, I hope he'll let me know and then we can talk about it. </P>
<P>I included a short letter sharing my thoughts on the chart and how I think it'll help both of the boys and himself get into a routine as well as let the boys know he's serious about their behavior. It's my hope that tying in the chart with the boys allowance will be a good motivator for the boys (and Pat) to see this through.</P>
<P>I also found out that Conner's next appointment with the doctor isn't this Friday but the Friday before Tyler's birthday (May 14th). Pat's going to be talking with the doctor about the Strattera (it's not working and it's been more than 6 weeks). </P>
<P>I reminded him to try and write down things that Conner does so he can give it to the doctor to help him/her (can't remember which it is) see how his behavior changes from day-to-day. I don't know if Pat will do it, but I really think it would help in the long run.</P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#3333ff><FONT size=4><STRONG><U>Friday</U>:</STRONG> </FONT></FONT>It was pretty uneventful. We hung out, played cards and the boys were in bed fairly early and easily for a change. We're up until midnight or so and then turn in for the evening. </P>
<P>We were both pretty tired, so we just cuddled and fell asleep. </P>
<P><lj-cut></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff size=4><U>Saturday</U>:</FONT></STRONG> Pat and I had a little ""morning fun"" and then got up a little after 7am. I hopped in the shower while Pat puttered around downstairs before he could get&nbsp;a shower in downstairs. By the time I got&nbsp;out of the bathroom upstairs (with velcro curlers in my hair) he had showered &amp; dressed and was having coffee. </P>
<P>As soon as he saw me he said, ""Don't you look lovely."" </P>
<P>I laughed and said, ""You like my curlers huh?"" </P>
<P>He laughed and said, ""You going to leave those in all morning?""&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>I laughed and said, ""Do you want me to? I can you know..."" </P>
<P>He looked semi-horrified so I laughed. I reassured him that I'd take them out before we left.</P>
<P>The morning was quite bad as far as the boys were concerned. They didn't want to do anything. First off, Conner sees me in my curlers and says, ""You look weird."" So, I&nbsp;say, ""Well, thanks!"" and finish cooking my eggs. &nbsp;</P>
<P>Conner was just going non-stop and Tyler was egging him on. Conner's pill hadn't kicked in yet and it wasn't pretty. The next thing you know, Conner is yelling at Tyler about killing him and then goes to grab a knif from the drawer. Pat runs over and grabs it from him and sits Conner down at the counter and talks to him. Tyler is on the other side of the counter now, hiding behind the couch. I'm just sitting at the table near the sliding door and doing my best to not say anything since the situation isn't the best right now and my voice doesn't need to be added to the mix.</P>
<P>After that calmed down a little bit, Pat went upstairs to check on something and Tyler came out from behind the couch and sat in the rocker next to the stairs. Conner immediately started up again and I asked him to please calm down. He brought up hurting Tyler again for getting him in trouble and I saw him get up and go towards the utensils again. I asked him to please not do anything. I repeated myself, but didn't yell. I could see him standing in front of the drawer and then he walked away and sat at the counter. </P>
<P>Pat came back down and I finished putting my make-up on at the table. After that, I went outside to talk with Marty and let Pat and the boys get their things together.</P>
<P>So, I was outside talking with Marty for about 10 minutes and then finally they start to come out. Conner is acting up again and Pat asks him, ""Are you trying to drive her away?"" as he points to me. Conner shrugs and says, ""Maybe, I don't know."" </P>
<P>Pat just shakes his head and says, ""Get in the car,"" and goes back into the house for some more things. &nbsp;</P>
<P>When we were getting in the car, Conner was sitting in the middle. Because they were still fighting, I told him that no one could sit in the middle because no one deserved to. He complained but Pat backed me up so Conner scooted over.</P>
<P>We eventually got on our way around 9:20 or so and the boys calmed down in the car.</P>
<P>Conner took out some of his aggression during his game and got a penalty for it, but by the time his game was over, he was relatively calm. </P>
<P>We left and went for an early lunch (11:30) and Conner refused to eat. So, all he had was something to drink while the rest of us ate. And since he had no food, he wasn't allowed to play with Tyler's toy (in his kids meal) and didn't like that. </P>
<P>Things went well, until after Tyler's game. His team lost and he was very upset (they lost to the 0-4 team). He complained and blamed everything on everyone else. When Pat and I tried to give him a few pointers (he wasn't passing the puck when there was an opening) and he got upset. He kept saying that we were telling him he was playing wrong and that he was stupid. We tried to tell him that we just wanted to help him and his team by letting him know what he could do to help his game and that he's not a bad player. </P>
<P>But it wasn't working.&nbsp;Everything we said was taken the wrong way and he just became more and more upset. </P>
<P>And when we pulled into the Kroger parking lot, he whined, ""Oh my&nbsp;God dad! Are you addicted to this place?!"" </P>
<P>I just shook my head and got out of the car. </P>
<P>Tyler was still whining and Pat told him that we were here to pick up something for dinner and that he didn't want to be here either, but if we weren't we wouldn't be having dinner. </P>
<P>I told Tyler, ""When you guys get your own refrigerator, then your dad won't have to keep coming to the grocery store all the time."" That shut him up.</P>
<P>So, we finally get the shopping done and are heading back home. Things go okay then and Pat and I&nbsp;catch the Red Wings &amp; Pistons games on TV before dinner. </P>
<P>We get out early for a 7:30 movie and the boys promised Marty that they'd get ready for bed and be good. Pat told them that they better not be up when we get back or they'd be in trouble. </P>
<P>So, Pat and I see <STRONG>13 Going on 30</STRONG> (my choice) and we're back at the house a little before 10pm. The power cable to the house still hadn't been fixed (a branch fell on it earlier in the afternoon) so the power was still surging in the house. Around 10:30 and Detroit Edison truck finally pulls up and lets us know that the power may dim further or shut off but if it does it'll only be for a minute or two while they fix the support cable. </P>
<P>Pat goes upstairs to check on the boys and Conner is still awake. He's playing his gameboy by the lamp and Tyler is fast asleep. He let's Conner know what's going on so he doesn't freak out if the lights go off (he's terrified of the dark) and then he comes back downstairs. </P>
<P>Ten minutes goes by and Pat and I are watching out the front window when part of the lights in the house go off. I kinda laugh and then Conner starts to freak out. I tell him that all the lights aren't out, so if he wants to, he can walk down the hall and come stay with us downstairs. It's pitch black in his room and he starts crying for Pat. Pat tries to get him to come down but he won't move and gets Pat to go in and get him. Finally, they come down and Conner's wiping his eyes. We head downstairs where the lights are still on and he calms down. We're down there for a few minutes and then we go back up to see if we can see the guys out the front window. The lights come back on and then the lights that were on before go out so the other half of the house is dark and Marty is in the bathroom in the dark now. </P>
<P>A minute later all the lights come back on and we can hear the truck outside move. So, we assure Conner that the lights won't be going off again tonight and he goes back up to his bed after Pat says ""good night"" to him again. After that, the three of us play a game of cards and then head off to bed. </P>
<P>After the day we both had, we needed some ""us time"" to release some tension and just be with each other. So, there was a lot of touching and stroking and just softness. Like I said, it was something we both needed and soon after we both were asleep.</P>
<P>I woke up around 3:30am and headed home shortly after that.</P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff><FONT size=4><STRONG><U>Sunday</U>:</STRONG> </FONT></FONT>I make it back over to the house around 12:45pm with plenty of time before leaving for Tyler's 2pm game.&nbsp; </P>
<P>It was Tyler's turn to act up so I won't get into that. But I'll just say that we made it there with a few minutes to spare and had to sit on&nbsp;a section of the bleachers where we couldn't see the rink too well.</P>
<P>Tyler had a rough game, they lost to the first place team. He didn't want to talk about it and made it very clear to us. </P>
<P>The boys had to take showers because Pat needed to cut their hair (it was looking pretty ragged) and that took about 90 minutes because they were fussing. I almost fell asleep on the couch twice while this was going on. Watching a NASCAR race didn't help to keep me awake either though.</P>
<P>The rest of the day went okay and things were good all the way up until the end of dinner. Again, they were acting up and didn't want to eat all of their dinner. But Pat, Sheila&nbsp;and I told them, if they didn't eat then they'd be going to bed early. Pat&nbsp;set the timer to two minutes and told them they had to have their plates clean or they'd get ready for bed. They pused it as far as they could, but they finished everything. By this time it's a little after 7pm and it had taken them 45 minutes to eat a small plate of food. </P>
<P>Things got worse from there. Pat, myself, Sheila and Marty tried to play Euchre but the boys kept acting up. We got one game out of the way (Pat and I won) but it was during the 2nd game that things really got out of hand. </P>
<P>Tyler was doing things to bug Sheila on purpose and laughing about it. He kept it up and was finally told to go up to his room if he couldn't be quiet. Then, while they were up stairs, he was egging Conner on and before you knew it both of them were acting up and things were being thrown around up there. </P>
<P>While Pat was up there, I contemplated leaving and heading home. Things didn't seem to be getting better and I didn't need to be around for this. </P>
<P>Pat finally came down after 5 minutes and we played some more. Then there was a loud thud. Pat ignored it and then there was pounding on the floor in their room. Sheila went up there and when she got there, Tyler had Conner pinned to the bed and had a pillow over his face. </P>
<P>So, Sheila carried Conner back down with her and put him on the couch. He curled up on the couch and was quiet for the rest of the time.</P>
<P>A minute later, Tyler tried to come down and when he wasn't allowed to, he demanded that Conner come back upstairs. Pat went back upstairs to talk to him and then it was quiet for the rest of the night. He went to couch to check on Conner and to make sure he was okay and then came back to the table to finish our game. </P>
<P>So, when the game was finally done, I said my good bye's to Sheila and Marty before heading upstairs with Pat.</P>
<P>As we were saying our good bye/night at the front door, Pat asked me if&nbsp;I was okay (considering the boys were quite horrible for the past few hours). I told him I was okay and gave him a kiss on the cheek. He leaned down, hugged me a bit tighter and said, ""At least you didn't leave."" I kinda laughed a little and said, ""Oh, I thought about it.""&nbsp; He turned his head in towards my neck and said, ""If you had, I really would've torn into them about it."" That made me feel good. </P>"

"event","<P>Well, I talked to Pat last night and inquired how early the boys went to bed (due to their behavior the night before). He said they'd been ""in bed"" since 9 o'clock. It was semi-impressive but they should be up in their room, IMHO, around 8:30 to settle down and then ""lights off"" at 9pm.&nbsp; </P>
<P>But, since they usually don't get to their room (for the past 6+ months) until almost 9:30-10:00, 9 o'clock was definately an improvement.</P>
<P>However, after being on the phone with him for about 6 minutes, Conner was down in Pat's room saying, ""I wanted to say 'good night' and give you a hug."" He pulls that stunt all the time when he doesn't want to be in his room. It only flys on Saturday night if we're still at the house and haven't gone out for the evening.</P>
<P>So we talk about some minor things that happened (or didn't happen) during the day and wouldn't you know it, Conner is back down in Pat's room. </P>
<P>I know he's only 8, but I think he's too <EM>clingy</EM> for his own good. Tyler's going to be at a new school next year (going into middle school) and he's not a very social boy. He doesn't like to play with the kids on his street unless he really, really, really wants to. If Tyler goes to a friend's or spends the night somewhere, Conner will not go outside to play (with his own things or with any of the neighbor kids). </P>
<P>Anyway, I'm rambling...</P>
<P>As we're saying ""good night"" I tell him that he's got to be strong and be mean. He's too nice to them. </P>
<P>Yes, he tells me that they already think he's mean, even when he's not. I get that. But I also told him that he needs to get over his guilt and just be mean. He's their father and not their friend. </P>
<P>Then he said this, ""They'll have no one to turn to if I turn up the meanness.""</P>
<P>I paused for a minute and then said, ""When you guys get your own place, they will have no one (else) to turn to when you tell them how things are. You need to get them used to that idea now. Grandma &amp;&nbsp;Grandpa and Aunt Sheila won't always be around to try and help them get their way. You need to get them used to the idea of what you say 'goes' and that's it.""</P>
<P>He was quiet for a minute and then said, ""I know.""</P>
<P>We talked a little more about the boys and then said our <EM>Good night</EM>'s and <EM>Love you</EM>'s.</P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=darkblue size=3>Boy oh boy would I have loved to be a fly on the wall at Pat's house last night. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>I finally called over to Pat's&nbsp;around 9:30 last night since he told me that he was going to try and call me ""early"" and he hadn't called yet.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>The first words out of his mouth were, ""It's finally calmed down here. I was going to give it a couple more minutes and then call you."" </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>""Oh really?"" was my reply.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>""Yeah, I even have my cell phone ear-piece plugged into the house phone so I can talk hands free,"" Pat said, and he sounded quite proud too. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>So, I inquired about what was going on and it revolved around <EM>homework not being done </EM>and the <EM>fit</EM> that followed when Pat busted both boys for lying to him about homework. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>Apparently, he had asked them (before dinner) if they had any homework, and they both told Pat ""No."" Usually, this is the case (the boys almost always get most of their work done while at school) but apparently, not last night. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>As Pat is getting things ready for school the next day, he checks their planners/binders and lookie, lookie . . . they both have homework to do. Busted!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>So now, both boys are now sitting at the counter, trying to do their work. A few minutes later, Conner throws a fit and says (I'm paraphrasing), ""I can't do it! It's stupid!"" He gets up off his stool and proceeds to have a raging fit. It's about time for his evening pill. He takes it, but it's a little later than usual and he's having a melt down. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>So, by the time I eventually called over around 9:30, both boys were up in bed and had been there for about 20 minutes, which is the earliest I've <STRONG>ever</STRONG> seen/heard of&nbsp;them in bed during the week. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>A few minutes into our conversation, Pat had to go upstairs to their room (and I heard the whole thing on the other end of the phone) and the following&nbsp;came out of his mouth (again, I'm pharaphrasing): </FONT><FONT color=#00008b size=3><STRONG>""I told you, the more you mess around the earlier you're gonna go to bed! Each time I hear something from up here, you're going to bed 30 minutes early the next night. If it get's bad, I'll take Tyler out of here and put him downstairs on the couch and then you&nbsp;will be here all by yourself.""</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>Neither of them liked that. They hate sleeping alone in their room and most nights, you'll find one of them in the other's bed because they hate being alone. But at the same time, they can't keep from fighting with each other. It's an odd cycle they have with each other.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>If I could've shouted for joy, I would've. But I kept my mouth shut.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#00008b size=3>I just hope Pat means it this time.&nbsp;<A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><IMG alt=""Fingers Crossed"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/12_3_46.gif"" border=0></A>&nbsp;</FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#3366ff><STRONG><FONT size=5><U>Friday</U>:</FONT></STRONG> </FONT>Went over early for dinner before Tyler's practice. That practice&nbsp;was a complete and utter waste of time since there were only 6 kids {less than half the team} who showed up. Pat &amp; I had both been suffering headaches that day. I took something after we got back from Tyler's practice but Pat didn't take anything until much later (just before going to bed). As a result, when we crawled into bed, he rolled over, wrapped an arm around me and said, ""So, are we getting frisky later?"" </P>
<P>I told him if his head wasn't bothering him too much, sure. But if not, I didn't want to make it worse (the last time we did, he ended up being very ill about 3 hours later). So, we fell asleep and the next thing I knew, it was 4:50am and I had to leave. He was a little disappointed (because his headache was gone) but that's what happens when I pass out from being tired too.&nbsp;<A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><IMG alt=""Winky 2"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_4_106.gif"" border=0></A></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff><FONT size=5><STRONG><U>Saturday</U>:</STRONG> </FONT></FONT>Had Sarah's Bridal Shower to&nbsp;go to at Noon so it was a fairly rushed time after I finally got into the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't get home until about 2:30 and had been home for about 5 minutes when Pat called. It's like the man has some kind of ESP or something and knows when I've just walked in the door or am in the bathroom. </P>
<P>I headed over there between the 1st and 2nd periods of the hockey game (had to change clothes &amp; pack a bag for Sunday &amp; bring an extra change of clothes for later that night) since there was no way I could be ready to go in 15 minutes (before the game started). Mike was bringing over the kids so they were outside for most of the day. </P>
<P><A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank></A>&nbsp;We played Euchre and Mike &amp; I lost to Pat and his dad. That sucked. After dinner, we were going to play another round, but then people started taking off for unknown areas of the house/yard and I got tired of waiting. So, I went upstairs and proceeded to do my hair for the evening. I was back about 30 minutes later and Mike &amp; Marty had been waiting for about 10 minutes (but Pat still wasn't there). They gave me a hard time, but I told them, ""You two left first and when neither of you came back after 10 mintues, I went and did my hair."" </P>
<P>They pretty much shut up with that. The rest of the evening went okay and Pat and I headed out the door around 8:30. We stayed at the bar until about 11:30 and then headed back since we had to be up early for his game the next morning.</P>
<P>I'm pretty sure Pat make up for the previous night's <EM>lack of lovin'</EM> because he had me so worked up I hardly noticed when he changed from one form of sex to the other.&nbsp; <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><IMG alt=""Couple In Bed"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/11/11_2_101.gif"" border=0></A></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5><FONT color=#3366ff><U>Sunday</U>: </FONT></FONT></STRONG>Woke up around 7am and had a shower &amp; breakfast before we headed out. It was already quite warm at 8am and it was supposed to get warmer as the day went on. Mike brought his kids with him because Michelle was out of town, so I watched them during the game. Mason (he's 4)spent the entire time running away from me, except when it came to the vending machine and his chips. MaKenna (she's 6) talked my ear off the entire time. The guys lost, so they're done for now. Pat doesn't know if he wants to play again this next season, or if he'll take a break. </P>
<P>After we got back to the house, we found out that the boys had just woken up and it was almost 10:30! It's very rare for both of them to sleep so late. But I headed home, I needed to do some laundry for the coming week and told Pat to call me when he knew what was going on.</P>
<P>I ended up over there after the 1st period of the basketball game was over. I had a crisis with the dryer (it was trying to eat one of my bras, so I spent time getting it out) and he commented on Sheila and Marty that I was late. I told him that a bra was in need of saving and that was priority over being on time. </P>
<P>So, we hung out and played two games of Euchre. Pat &amp; I won one and Sheila &amp; Marty won one. We were going to play one more after dinner to settle it. Dinner went fine. </P>
<P>We had gotten into the last card game for the night and were almost finished when Marty noticed that the new neighbors were outside talking with some of the other neighbors. So, he got up and went to his truck so they would see him and call him over to talk. Twenty minutes passed and he still hadn't come back. Then Pat disappears upstairs. So, Sheila and I are waiting (and watching a movie) for about 30 minutes before I go up the stairs. I see Pat, sitting at the computer and he's setting up Tyler with an e-mail account. He told me this when I asked him what was going on. Tyler wasn't even there next to him. So, when he told me, I just said, ""Whatever,"" and turned around and walked back down the stairs. </P>
<P>I got back to the table and told Sheila that we were finished. I was tired of waiting for them and then I cleared off the table and put the cards away. As I was putting the cards away, Pat tried to explain himself (from upstairs) and then I said, pretty loudly,&nbsp;""Well, it was nice of you to let us know what you were doing! It wasn't that hard you know!""&nbsp; Sheila just kinda looked at me and then smiled. </P>
<P>After I put the cards away, we sat there and watched the rest of the movie. Pat came down a few minutes later and I wouldn't look at him. I kept my chair turned toward the TV and ignored him. When I finally turned and looked at him, he said, ""I don't want you to be mad."" </P>
<P>I said, ""It's too late for that. I'm more irritated than mad though."" He didn't say anything and then he was called away for something. </P>
<P>Marty finally came in a little after that and wanted to know where the cards were. After Sheila and I told him why we quit, he got a little vocal and said that we didn't have to do that. We told him that wasn't the point. Both he and Pat had been rude and we weren't going to put up with it. He didn't say anything after that.</P>
<P>I took that opportunity to go into the bathroom to give myself a moment because I was afraid I was going to cry. I could feel the tears briming. I didn't cry though. I blinked those away and blew my nose.</P>
<P>By the time I came out of the bathroom, Pat was back downstairs and I had to&nbsp;walk by him to get by. He asked me what was going on, and I just shrugged and went to the couch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>I was sitting on the end of the couch when he came back downstairs. So he sat down on the arm, put his arm around me and asked, ""Are you still going to be crabby?""</P>
<P>I said, ""I might."" He started to say something but then I looked up at him and said, ""You started this.""&nbsp; He said that he was sorry and that he had a lot on his mind. I told him that, that was still no excuse. He then asked me what I wanted to do, but then chaos broke out upstairs and he had to check it out.</P>
<P>By the time he came back down I had moved over on the couch becasue I didn't want him to sit to the side/in front of me. So, if he wanted to sit on the couch with me, he had to sit next to the arm and let me lean into him. I figured it was a very subtle way of telling him that he owed me some time and he better give it to me. </P>
<P>I got it too. About 90 minutes of it. We saw the end of <EM>Extreme Makeover: Home Edition</EM> and then all of <EM>Alias</EM>.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Sandie and Time came over just before Alias started so I said ""hello"" to them (but no hugs) because I was still a little irritated with Pat when they came over. But, when I was saying my goodbyes, everyone got hugs because my irritation had slowly disappeared over the course of an hour. </P>
<P>Pat and I said our goodbye's at the door but he kept prolonging it with something he forgot to mention (about three times). So, he got more kisses than normal but I had to leave becasue it was 10:10 and I was exhausted. <BR><A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb034"" target=_blank><IMG src=""http://www.smileycentral.com/sig.jsp?pc=ZSzeb034"" border=0></A></P>"

<P>So, if you're looking for an update, sorry...there won't be one for that week. </P>"

"event","<P>The boys (especially Conner) were in rare form Monday night when I made it over to the house a little after 7pm. Pat was still trying to get things done for the next morning (for the boys and himself) so I sat at the table with Barb and Tyler while he ran around getting things done.</P>
<P>I saw a <A href=""http://www.jessicalondon.com/jessicalondon/product/product.asp?pf_id=38922&amp;dept_id=936&amp;rootdept=630&amp;parent_id=&amp;"">cute bathing suit</A> that I might get so I copied down the web site to look it up later. </P>
<P>The last 30 minutes before we left for his game were pretty bad. They were acting up and I thought Pat was gonna blow a gasket or something. He threatened the boys that if he heard anything bad when he came home, they'd get something else taken away (he took away their gameboys again on Saturday). He also said that if they were awake by the time we got back,&nbsp;<A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank></A>&nbsp;they'd be in serious trouble and he'd have to think about their punishment. </P>
<P>When we got to the JCC Pat made a quick stop in the bathroom. When he came back, he ran into one of the guys on his team and they were talking back (to me and Pat's bag) together. Pat grabbed his gear and started walking away. No ""bye"" from him and not even enough time for me to wish him luck. I felt that <EM>irritation</EM> coming back. I threw up my hands and said, ""Well, <STRONG>bye!</STRONG>"" and started walking towards the bleachers. I didn't look back, but I heard him say, ""Bye!"" to me. </P>
<P>Men! <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><IMG alt=Dismay src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_6_102.gif"" border=0></A></P>
<P>So, I make my way to my usual spot on the bleachers and settle down with my book and read. A little while later, I feel someone poking at my back through the fence. I look down around my right shoulder, but I can't see anything. I look around the other side and see Pat. He apologized for blowing me off earlier. </P>
<P>I milked this for all it was worth. I used a lot of ""Uh-huh"" and ""Yeah, sure"" and ""Yeah, sure you did"" on him while I keep reading my book. He apologized for sounding like Conner with his ""Bye!"" earlier and I gave him another ""Uh-huh."" He skated off and finished warming up. </P>
<P>They won, so they'll be playing again April 18th for their first play-off game. </P>
<P>After we got in the car, he leaned over, kissed me on the cheek and apologized again. He said that he had a brain fart and that he was sorry. I kinda laughed, called him, ""Brain Fart Boy"" and kissed him on the cheek. </P>
<P>Then I gave him a hard time about opening windows and the sunroof (because he was hot and I wasn't). He would've suffered if I told him not to crack the sunroof or the windows. So, I knew then, that he was sorry for what happened earlier. So, I opened the sunroof and told him that we needed to get back.</P>
<P>We got back to the house and the boys had been asleep for about two hours. </P>
<P>As we were saying our goodbyes at the house, I got a long hug and quite a few kisses. </P>
<P>I called him Brain Fart Boy as I walked out the front door and towards my car. He asked me if he was going to use that again, and I told him that I was going to use it all week . . . milk it for all it's worth. He laughed. </P>
<P>I kept the part about it making me feel better, to myself.</P>"

"event","<P>I was still kind of smarting over what happened on Friday night and my throat was still bothering me as well. So, I didn't talk to anyone all morning and still didn't talk to anyone until some time around 2pm when Pat called.</P>
<P>He asked me what my plan for the rest of the day was and I told him, ""I don't know. I hadn't really thought about it."" I only half listened to him as I watched the Wings game on TV. He then asked me what I was doing, and I told him, ""Watching the game."" </P>
<P>He was quiet for a minute or two and then asked, ""Are you feeling better?""</P>
<P>I was feeling better, physically, but emotionally, I was still a bit irritated at him. But, I swallowed it and told him I was fine. After all, if I let the irritation build, it'd get out of control. Not a good thing. So, I tell Pat that I'll call him sometime during the 2nd &amp; 3rd periods of the game to let him know what's up and we say goodbye for now.</P>
<P>Fastforward to the middle of the 2nd period and I send him a text message (instead of calling) to save my voice, telling him that I'll head over after the 2nd period is over. </P>
<P>A little while later, I get one back telling me that he plans on running to the store to pick up things for dinner so I should call him before I leave the house. </P>
<P>So, a little after 3pm I give him a call and he's just about to head out the door to the store. I tell him I have an errand to run myself so I'll head to the house after I'm done with that.</P>
<P>I make my stops and then head to the house . . . and beat them there. So, I gather some things to be thrown out, and put them in an extra bag I happen to have in the car and they pull in the driveway as I'm doing this. I finish up and get out of the car just as Pat's taking things out of the car to head inside.</P>
<P>I get a kiss hello and a quick, half hug as his other arm is full and we go in. The boys take off, no ""hi"" or ""hello"" from either of them and we don't see them again until dinner's ready. </P>
<P>Pat's very picky about what he eats, so after going out for 15 months, I have yet to cook anything for him. Yes, he's <STRONG>that</STRONG> picky. </P>
<P>After dinner, to kill some time, Pat and I watch <EM>Sweet Home Alabama</EM> while we wait for Barb and Marty to come home. We've a date to go see <EM>Jersey Girl</EM> at the local theater (my choice since his last choice sucked). </P>
<P>Of course, I cry when Melanie (Reese Witherspoon's character) goes to the Coon Dog grave yard to see the dog she and Jake had when she still lived there.

<P>After getting back to the house we headed down to his room and since I was in a better mood, I set to scratching his back (which I know he loves). A little while into it, he lifts up an arm and tries to scratch my back. I laugh and he sits up and gently pushes me down so he can scratch my back. Of course, that doesn't last very long and soon I have kisses trailing up and down my back and he's using the hair on his chin to tickle my lower back before he kisses it. </P>
<P>Needless to say, he proceeds to lavish attention on me and it's a blissful 30 minutes and half of my hair is soaked. <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><IMG alt=""Couple In Bed"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/11/11_2_101.gif"" border=0></A></P>
<P>When we're done, I move lower on the bed to try and cool myself down. We talk softly for a little while and just before I'm ready to move up the bed, I tap him on the chest and tell him to ""Come here."" He does but I tell him, ""Come here, closer.""</P>
<P>He does, and when he's finally face to face with me, I kiss him and say, ""I love you."" I can see him smile in the faint light and he tells me that he loves me and then I crawl up and we cuddle before falling asleep. </P>
<P>I wake up some time around 2:30 and head home.</P>"

"event","Usually Friday nights, Pat and I stay in and just kinda veg out. Normally, that's just fine with me.

However, I've been kinda under the weather lately (last few weeks with sinus issues) and just the other night, I was telling Pat how I wish he'd be able to come over here (to my house) once in awhile so we could just relax here, on my couch. Not feeling 100%, I kinda would've liked to have him come and see me for a change. [Pat has only been to my house three times, the boys hate coming over because it's ""so boring"".] Pat knows this, especially after I bought it up the other night. So, you'd think it would be fresh in his mind.

It turns out that Conner had a birthday/slumber party to go to last night (which I already knew about). Later, Tyler asks Pat if he can go to a friend's house for awhile. I'm on the phone with Pat when this latter part is happening so I figured we'd get a few hours of quiet without either kid at home.

By the time I have dinner and pick up my own drinks (they have nothing caffeine free at their place) and call to let him know I'm on my way, it's almost 7:30. 

After I've been there for about an hour, I ask Pat when Tyler is coming back. He says, ""Oh, he's not. He ended up sending the night at his friend's house."" Pat neglected to tell me this when I called to let him know I was on my way. We're in the middle of a card game with his parents, so I don't say anything (it also hurts like hell to talk too much with my sore throat).

By a little after 11:00 I'm pooped and ready to go. So, I put my shoes and jacket on, fairly quickly, and grab my stuff to head out the door. We say our goodbyes/good nights at the door and then the tears start to fall. 

I tell Pat that I have to go because I don't want to be there when the tears really start to fall. He sees the tears, asks me what's wrong and when I tell him I'm having a huge case of the <i>poor me's</i> he just kinda stands there. I remind him that dealing with my sinuses and a sore throat for three weeks hasn't exactly been easy on me. Between all the meds I got last week (at the doctor), work and lousy sleep, I'm exhausted. 

Yeah, I get a long hug, and he just stands there with his arms around me, but he's clueless. He asks me if I really need to go, that if I do, he's going to be ""all alone."" That just did it. I peeled his arms off me and said, ""Oh please. I don't want to hear that."" 

I'm too tired to fight so I just kiss him on the cheek, tell him I love him and go out the door with tears running down my face. 

Now, I know he probably had <b>no clue</b> as to everything that's bothering me. But I was extremely irritated that he didn't tell me that the boys would be gone all night. If I had known, I would've asked him to come over to my house.

But, I never got the opportunity to do so.

<i>*sigh*</i>

I'm still a little upset about it and it's not really that much of a big deal, so I'm upset with myself too. 

<i>*sigh*</i>

Being semi-sick sucks. 

I haven't spoken to anyone yet today (trying to save my voice) but I needed to get it out."

<P>Pat decided that he'd try taking both boys tonight and see how they'd do. Things weren't going very well before we even left the garage. It seemed to take them forever to get their seat belts on. That should've been the first indication that things wouldn't be going very well. The ride to JCC was okay, but the boys were buzzin' in their seats. </P>
<P>Once there, Pat gave them their stuff to carry in and it was a mad rush for the door (you'd think they were gonna freeze or something) and then Tyler slammed himself into the door on purpose. He did this because he had his skates on already and proclaimed, to everyone who could hear, ""I can't stop! I can't stop! Conner, open the door! Open the door!"" Of course, Conner wasn't fast enough, and he plowed himself right into the left door. <EM>*sigh*</EM>&nbsp; </P>
<P>I wished Pat ""Good Luck"" once we were inside and headed straight for the bathroom since my stomach wasn't feeling too hot. When I came out, the boys bag was underneath the rear of the bleachers (an open area where a lot of people stow their gear bags) and skating around the other set of bleachers. So, I bought myself a bottle of Powerade (figured it was a good idea since I was feeling a little icky) and then climbed the bleachers to get myself a seat.</P>
<P>About two minutes later, I hear Conner call me from the floor and ask, ""Bianca, did dad give you any money for us?"" I tell him ""No,"" and he's a bit miffed and then skates off to tell Tyler they don't have any money. The&nbsp;<A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank></A>&nbsp;game starts and five minutes go by and I don't see them, but I can hear them. That's when my stomach decides to make itself known again, and that it's not happy. So, I'm off again to the bathroom and this time, I'm gone for about 15 minutes. </P>
<P>By the time I come back, the first period is over and the 2nd has started. I'm about 5 feet from the bathroom and my phone rings, it's BK and we talk for almost 20 minutes and I finally make my way out back to the bleachers.&nbsp;I see&nbsp;Barb &amp; Marty are there when I clear the double doors . And what are they doing? Oh, they're getting something for Tyler and Conner from the vending machines. <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><IMG alt=Dismay src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/4/4_6_102.gif"" border=0></A>&nbsp;Yes, they are the grandparents, but after the way the boys are, you'd think they'd know better and just not buy them anything; period.</P>
<P>About five minutes after that, I'm off the phone with BK and back into watching the game. </P>
<P>A few minutes later, the chaos slowly starts to build. Conner begins to sass everyone and Tyler turns into a pretty insane goofball. All I'll say is, ""It wasn't pretty."" Those last 25 minutes weren't very nice.</P>
<P>So, once the game was over, I gathered my things and headed to the small set of bleachers nearest the door.&nbsp; A couple of minutes later, the boys make their way over to me and&nbsp;Conner's dragging the bag behind him. He stops, with the bag right in front of me and says, ""Tyler keeps making me take the bag!"" I look up from my book and say, ""That's not my problem,"" and then go back to reading. I could see Conner out of the corner of my eye and I think that took him back a little bit. Next, he says, ""It's not my problem either!"" and then hauls the bag to the side of the bleachers. Tyler comes over and wants to know where the puck is. They've lost it somewhere.</P>
<P>Marty and Barb come over to say&nbsp;Goodbye and convince the boys to go back and look around for their puck. Once they come back with it, they say Goodbye and headed home. Since they had their puck back, they wanted to skate around some more before Pat came out. I just mentally shook my head over this, since it's already been about 5 minutes since Pat went into the locker room. </P>
<P>When Pat makes his way over to me, the boys down by the furthest set of bleachers. Pat looks down at me and asks me if I'm ready to go, I say ""yes"" and then Pat yells, ""Let's go! I told you guys to be ready and waiting for me when I got out here! Let's go.""</P>
<P>Pat hitched his bag over his shoulder and said, ""Let's go,"" to me and we left for the car.&nbsp; We could see the boys scrambling to get their things together and make it back to their bag. </P>
<P>Pat and I are in the car waiting, with the rear door up and open for them to load their stuff in the back. You can hear the boys coming because they're making a huge racket. Conner is screaming that he can't find his gameboy and that Tyler made him leave it back inside the building. He climbed in the car and refused to move, but he kept on screaming. He started to tear apart the bag while Pat and Tyler went back inside to look for the gameboy. </P>
<P>They come back to the car, the gameboy nowhere to be found. Conner is still screaming and then he says that he found the gameboy in the bag. Now, Pat's more than irritated and Tyler is yelling about being made to go back into the building to look for something that wasn't really lost. </P>
<P>The ride home was horrid. The yelling and screaming continued.&nbsp;Pat took both gameboys from them after Tyler hit Conner in the head with his gameboy. By the time we got to the house, the boys had calmed down a bit and were actually laughing. </P>
<P>Pat took his stuff from the back of the car and headed in. He told the boys to take their stuff in the house and straight up to their room. Tyler took his stick and went straight in. Conner was still in the car messing around and I told him to hurry up because it was late; then I went inside. I left the door open and the lights on in the garage because I know Conner's still afraid of the dark. </P>
<P>I make my way downstairs and go to the bathroom (all this drinking makes my bladder feel very small). Then next thing I know, Conner slams into the house and stomps down the stairs and launches himself into a chair at the table. He's yelling and crying the whole time about how his dad obviously doesn't care about him and that he was just left in the garage where anyone could've come and killed him. And that if he had been killed that Pat wouldn't care. </P>
<P>Pat went straight outside, took the remaining stuff upstairs and then came back downstairs. Barb is trying to get Conner to calm down, but it's not working. I keep myself at the kitchen counter and just sit and listen.</P>
<P>This ordeal goes on for about 20 minutes and somehow, Pat manages to get the boys ready for bed in the process. He comes down to see me and I make my exit. </P>
<P>Pat asked me, ""Why do they act like that?"" </P>
<P>I just wrapped my arms around him, hugged him and said, ""Because they can. They do it because they know they can.""</P>
<P>He looked down at me and said, ""Huh?""</P>
<P>So, I repeated myself, gave him a kiss, said goodnight &amp; ""I love you"" and went home.</P>"

Pat asked me if it was okay if Tyler came along, I just shrugged&nbsp;<A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank></A>&nbsp;my shoulders and said ""Sure.""&nbsp; Marty showed up a little while after the game started and Tyler pretty much kept to himself and just skated around. Once, he sat near me on the bleachers, but I think that was mainly because there was a small group of kids around that night and they were having&nbsp;a good time with each other and Tyler was by himself. Of course, his sitting didn't last for long and then he was gone again. </P>
<P>My sinuses were still kicking my ass so I was semi-miserable and my cheering and yelling at the game didn't help my throat at all. </P>
<P>Tyler, again, wasn't ready by the time Pat came out of the locker room and I just waited for the shoe to drop; but it never did.&nbsp; <EM>*sigh*</EM>&nbsp; The ride home was pretty uneventfull so thank God for small favors. </P>
<P>So, it was a relatively calm night and Pat &amp; I said our good night's and I love you's in <EM>quiet</EM> for a change. </P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=5><STRONG>March 16 - Tuesday: </STRONG><FONT color=#000000 size=3>I wasn't sure if I was going to make it to Conner's game (6:00) or not because I was meeting Ivane (my younger sister)&nbsp;at Bella's Bridal to be measured for dresses (her wedding). So, I had originally told Pat that I probably wouldn't be able to make it. However, we were finished just a little after 5:00 and I was already half-way to Novi so I picked up a little something for myself (female in nature) and headed over. I was quite early, so I bought an icee and a Snickers bar to tide me over for dinner, dug out my book&nbsp;and waited for Pat and the boys to show up for the game. They were running late and didn't walk in the door until almost 10 minutes 'til game time. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=5><FONT color=#000000 size=3>When they came around the bleachers, Pat saw me he was clearly surprised to see me. I got my kiss <EM>hello</EM> and then he said to Conner, ""Look who's here!"" Conner just looked at me and then dug right into his bag for his gear. No ""hi"" or anything from him. That hurt. Pat asked me why&nbsp;I was there so I filled him in. I asked where Tyler was and he said, ""He didn't want to come and when I asked him why, he said, 'He didn't come to mine so I'm not going to his!'"" I tell ya, if it's not one thing, it's another with those two. <EM>*sigh*</EM></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>After the game, since Pat and I had taken the following day off work, I was going to meet them back at the house and hang out for a while. </P>
<P>I beat them both back to the house by about five minutes, which was surprising to me, but hey, not the first time that's happened. So, I basically just hung out there for awhile, and we played cards with Barb and Marty after the boys went to bed (no mishaps this time, thank God). We finally settled on me coming back over around 10:00 the next morning, so I headed home a little after 11:30. I definately had to rest up for the next day.</P>
<P><FONT color=#009900 size=5><STRONG><A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank></A>&nbsp;March 17 - Wednesday: </STRONG><A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><STRONG><IMG alt=""Happy St. Patty"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/8/8_9_1.gif"" border=0 s Day?></STRONG></A>&nbsp;<FONT color=#000000 size=3>I was up 20 minutes early and I still didn't have extra time. Curling my hair with a curling iron is a major pain in the ass, but if I do it right, it'll last all day long. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P>I ring the door bell and how does he answer the door . . . in jeans and bare feet. My God, he looked soooooooo hot. I'm pretty sure he could read the <A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb001"" target=_blank><IMG alt=""I Want You"" src=""http://smileys.smileycentral.com/cat/23/23_11_15.gif"" border=0></A>&nbsp;that was written all over my face. And at that point, I was cursing the fact that I had started my period the day before. So, I just settled for the kiss at the door and a quick wiff of his neck before he headed down to his room to finish dressing. </P>
<P>I had meant to stop at the ATM and pick up some cash for the day, but was feeling rushed and didn't make it. So, Pat and I settled on me picking up the lunch tab and he'd get everything else. It worked out since lunch cost almost as much as the rest of the day. </P>
<P>It was a good time and it's always good to see Jennifer when she's in town. She also informed us that when Clint gets back from Afganistan and they're back in Michigan, that they're going to renew their vows and make it a huge party and we're all invited. So, this should happen some time in July or August. I just hope I'm around for it because I'd really hate to miss it.</P>
<P>Barb calls around 6:30 and wants to know when we'll be back to the house. We take that as our cue to gather things up and head out soon. So, to save time, we stop by McDonald's and pick up something to eat so she doesn't go crazy. And, when we get back to the house and they see we have a McDonald's bag, they rag on Pat because he didn't take me out to dinner. Huh? She drops a big hint that she's waiting for us to come back and then gives us a hard time because we go to McDonald's instead. I don't get it. </P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=5><STRONG>March 18 - Thursday: </STRONG><FONT color=#000000 size=3>Not much really went on other than me going to the doctor after work because this sinus issue is really kicking my ass. So, I leave there with four different perscriptions as well as a shot in the ass. Of course, I had to open my mouth and tell mom that I went to the doctor and then she proceeds to rip into me and say everything, just short of calling me stupid. Yeah, that makes a person feel good. So, by the time I talk to Pat that night, I'm feeling like shit and need someone to make me feel better. He does a good job of getting me to forget about my troubles with my mom. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=5><STRONG>March 19 - Friday: </STRONG><FONT color=#000000 size=3>We don't have anything planned for the evening so we just planned on&nbsp;hanging out. Mom proceeds, again, to give me a hard time and pressed me to stay home. All I wanted to do, was cuddle with my boyfriend. That's not much to ask for and the only way I can get that, early in the evening, is to go over there and see him. So, I went. I got my time with Pat that I needed, and some post-sex&nbsp;cuddling. I really just needed to be held and Pat picked up on that, I told him about the most recent ""session"" with my mom earlier and he knew that I wasn't exactly feeling too chipper. So, I got what I needed. Later, since I couldn't sleep at all, I left for home around 1:30.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=5><STRONG>March 20 - Saturday: </STRONG><FONT color=#000000 size=3>I&nbsp;skipped Tyler's 4:00 game so I could stay home and rest&nbsp;before Mike &amp; Michelle's party later that night. The morning was pure hell. I seriously contemplated&nbsp;not going but because they needed a certain amount of people there (it was a Euchre party) my not going would screw things up. So, I sucked it up and make sure I had plenty&nbsp;to drink and keep my throat dry. &nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Again, I had another ""thing"" with mom. So, I left the house being very, very irritated. This time, it was because I was going to spend maybe $7 at this party and gambling. $7 is a helluva lot cheaper than going out to dinner or to a movie and I'd be inside the whole time and not out at a bar. This whole thing wasn't starting out very well and I hate being ticked off when I'm trying to have a good time. </P>
<P>I&nbsp;only saw Pat twice (at the same table) but it was a decent time. I was very tired by the time we left (some time around 11:30). The boys went up to bed and Pat &amp; I went to his room to relax and watch the end of the hockey game. </P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=5><STRONG>March 21 - Sunday: </STRONG><FONT color=#000000 size=3>I had Shelly's Bridal Shower to go to at 1:00 and I seriously needed to do laundry (down to the last of my wearable wardrobe) so I&nbsp;wouldn't be going over to Pat's at all.&nbsp;He called around 2:00 just after I got home from the shower&nbsp;and he was ready to head out and get the boys new shoes (they had ruined their shoes playing in the dirt pile next door, which they were told not to play in). He asked if I had finished with all my things and if I was going to come over or not. I told him I had just gotten back from the shower and just started laundry so it was doubtful that I'd be coming over. So, he told me to call if I got bored and that he'd talk to me later. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000>There was more to the conversation, and Pat did explain to Tyler that he did care for him and his brother; and that, that was why he has them with him and does what he can for them. Tyler then tried to say that their mother&nbsp;cares more for them (he and his brother) than Pat and the rest of the family does. Pat had to remind him that their mother&nbsp;doesn't see them any more (her choice) and that they're lucky if she calls once every two to three months. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>This whole thing stems from the fact that he expects to have everything he thinks he deserves and should have it now or, worst case, the very next day (which I'll get to tomorrow when I update the rest of the weekend).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Anyway, after Pat recounted the happenings upstairs and went back up there to speak with Tyler, I went outside to start my car. I so didn't need to be around for whatever else might happen that night and at that point, it was only 7:30pm. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Pat came back downstairs a couple of minutes later and I informed him that I had started my car and I'd be heading home soon.

<P><FONT color=#000000>I got a hug, which was very much appreciated and then he walked me outside so we could say our goodbye's privately (the temperature, bone chilling, kept it short and sweet). </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>I'll see him tomorrow when I come over to meet up with him to go to his hockey game later in the evening. Maybe on the ride over I'll talk to him and see how his talk with Tyler (he told me he was going to speak with him before the boys went to bed tonight) went. </FONT></P>

We had talked about going out to see a movie, but that all depended on when they got back from dinner. Barb and Marty got back a little after 8:00 and then about 30 mintues later, Tim and Sandie walked in.</P>

<P>I can hear the sounds of feet going up and down the stairs and moving about, but it's fairly quiet (this goes on for about 30 minutes) so I keep going about my business.. I finally get him to the point where he's caught up with me and then I hear a loud boom (someone skipped the last few steps and ""landed"" on the floor) followed by another one and then one of the boys started yelling. </P>
<P>I know it's a lost cause at this point. I sigh heavily and roll away and face the wall. I have to admit, I'm not exactly the happiest person right then but I figured I should collect myself before I started crying (being this close to starting my period has my emotions being very, very touchy). I guess Pat heard me sniffle, because he rolled over and pressed himself into my back and wrapped an arm around me. I got about a good 30 seconds out of that before more hell started breaking loose upstairs. Pat got out of bed, put a robe on and went up to investigate. </P>
<P>I got dressed (t-shirt and shorts) and headed upstairs after I had composed myself. I took my cold medication and sat down at the table to read my book (Reunion in Death). Marty comes in and tells me what fun stuff he found in the upper level bathroom: pee, all over the floor and it had been there all night. When he inquired to all three boys, who had done it (he wasn't going to punish any of them, he just wanted to know) Tyler burst into tears because he assumed that he was being blamed for it. One thing about Tyler; when he gets blamed for something he hasn't done, he cries. When he has done it, he gets quiet and doesn't talk.</P>
<P>Conner was just being a little hellion. The doctor started him on Straterra on Friday (he started Friday night), but it's going to take quite a few weeks before a difference is noticed. So, Conner had his breakfast alone (Tyler and Hunter would eat later) at the counter and then was let back upstairs to get dressed. </P>
<P>I won't go into more detail, but suffice it to say that it was a very long morning before we left for hockey, and that was only 90 minutes. I had, had my fill of Tyler and Conner's attitudes and ignoring Pat to last me the rest of the entire day.</P>
<P>Conner's team won their first game, and Conner made his first goal. Tyler's team wasn't as fortunate. They lost but their team still had a little celebration (cake and juice boxes). </P>
<P>We got back to the house a little before 1:00 but I had to go and run some errands, so I didn't stick around. I think Pat knew I was close to my ""limit"" with the boys, so he kissed me goodbye and told me he'd call me later. So, I took off and ran my errands before going home to get some more things done there and then start to get ready for later that night.<A href=""http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb028"" target=_blank><IMG src=""http://www.smileycentral.com/sig.jsp?pc=ZSzeb028"" border=0></A></P>
<P>For some reason, my ""irked feeling"" towards the boys hadn't gone away by the time I got back to Pat's around 5:00. It wasn't too bad, but I think that's because the boys were ""doing their own thing"" and not pestering anyone.</P>
<P>So, I hang out for awhile and then about 6:00 it didn't look like we were going to be eating until 7:00 or so, so I headed upstairs to do my hair (takes me about 45 minutes). And, of course, about half-way through, I can hear them downstairs and they're eating. No biggie, but I always feel a little akward when I sit at the counter by myself and eat. So, I finish with my hair about 7:15 and make myself a sandwich.</P>
<P>One irkesome thing here: No comments from Pat about my <i>curly</i> hair. Now, every time I go over there (usually on a Sunday) with super-straight hair, he comments on it; every single time. So, I figured, since I was upstairs doing my hair (and he came in twice to ""check on me"") he'd say something about it. But does he? Nope. *sigh* Pat goes back downstairs after checking on me, to see if I'd eaten anything, and changes clothes and does whatever else he needs to do to get ready.</P>
<P>My sandwich now finished, I head to the bathroom to do my make-up and check on the hair. It doesn't take me long to finish up, so I plop myself into the rocker and sit by the fire and wait for Pat. He's my gague of when I go and change my clothes. So, if he's completely done, I'll go and change my clothes and then we leave. About 10 minutes later, he's back up and changed into new clothes and carrying his black shoes; he's all ready to go. So, I make my way to his room and change my own clothes.</P>
<p>At this point, I'm mentally crossing my fingers that we'll be able to get out of the house by 8:15. That's if the boys don't give Pat any trouble.</p>
<p>Yeah, that didn't happen. We didn't leave until about 8:35 or so and my ""irked"" feeling was back and even Pat was starting to get on my nerves (but it wasn't his fault).</p>
<p>He cracks a joke about my headlights and then asks, as we're almost out of the subdivision, ""I can drive if you don't want to.""</p>
<p>I look at him out of the corner of my eye and said, ""I don't care. If you want to drive, you can drive.""</p>
<p>I can feel him looking at me (I resist the urge to look at him in return) and then I can feel his hand on my right leg and he gives it a little squeeze. ""Are you okay?"" he asks.</p>
<p>I tell him that I'll be okay eventually; that I'm just very irritated. When he asks why, I tell him that it's because of the boys and their attitude that seems to be carrying on from earlier in the day. I turn my head and look at him as I say this. I reassure him that it's not him I'm irritated with (I already got over the driving thing) and that I'd be fine and not irritated in a little while. I think he was a little skeptical, but he said, ""okay."" </P>
<p>We talked about little things on the way, but nothing big. We make it to the bar a little after 9:15 and when we walk in, we think that we're good because there are a lot of empty tables. <i>That was mistake number 1.</i></p>
<p>We find out, that all six of those tables (nice, long ones) were reserved for some chick's bachelorette party. Not to mention the smaller room near the front door; most of that was reserved for that damn party too. So, there was no place to sit and this bar, it's not exactly designed for standing either.</p>
<p>We talk to Kelley (singer in the band we were there to see) for a little while and then made our way to the less crowded part of the bar; near the front door. After 20 minutes or so, Virginia walks in and we clue her in on the situation. While Pat's talking to her, I turn to the guy who's working the door and ask him if he could give us our money back since there was no place to sit. <i>That was mistake number 2.</i></p>
<p>He looked at me like I was a moron and said, ""No!"" Not just ""no,"" but ""No!""</p>
<p>Yeah, that didn't make me real happy. My temper flaired and I could just feel myself simmering. So, we stand around for a little while longer; trying to decided what we want to do instead. We do this for about 20 more minutes while we talk with Virginia about various things (turns out that Jennifer is going to come back to MI for a week). All the while, my simmering continues and keeps on rising. I feel angry tears try and break through a couple of times. Once, it did, and I took advantage of the hair and bowed my head a little bit and wiped the tears away.</p>
<p>To shorten this up a bit, we ended up leaving the bar a little after 10:00, after a waitress had come up and offered us a small table (real small) in the very back corner of the bar. She was very nice, but by that point, I was so mad, nothing would've made me want to stay there. So, I told her ""Thanks, but give it to someone else."" Pat asked me what I wanted to do, but I just said, ""I'm leaving"" and turned away and walked out the door. I slammed open the outside door and Pat was right behind me.</p>
<p>I got a, ""Take it easy missy, you'll hurt yourself,"" from him since I didn't move out of the door's way fast enough and it hit me in the arm as I was trying to get by it. For once, he had to walk fast to keep up with me. He asked me if I was going to be okay. I just shrugged and said, ""I'm so pissed off right now, so no, I'm not okay. I'll get over it though.""</p>
<p>So, we walked back to the car and got in. I let it run for a little bit since it was cold out and tried to compose myself. Pat said he'd call up Sandie and see what she and Tim were doing, but she wasn't answering her phone.</p>
<p>I was just sitting there, so Pat said, ""Why don't we start driving and head towards home and he'll try her again on the way."" So, we left the parking lot and started heading home.</p>
<p>He couldn't get ahold of Sandie and Ivane was home (Matt was studying so she was staying in). So, we decided to shoot some pool over at the Shark Club. It wasn't everyday we got out and neither of us wanted to go back to the house this early.</p>
<p>We got a table right away (which wasn't usual lately for 11pm on a Saturday night) and continued to shoot until 1am. After that, we called it a night and headed home.</p>
<p>I got some good cuddle action with Pat, I think he could tell that I needed it, and soon we were both asleep. I didn't wake up again until 5:30am when I got dressed and headed home.</p>"

"event","so lately,things have been interesting. theres someone new and we both like each other... see the thing is he wants to take things slow which i'm totally ok with but u see, if you think about it, besides the public aspect of it, whats the difference between this emotional connection and formally going out??? there are other things involved which im not putting up on the internet, but ya... i mean i dont know... i hate overthinking things but situations like this always make me think theres more to it than what someone is admitting. i mean what if he just doesnt want to make it public cuz hes embarassed of me?? what if he thinks his friends dont think i'm hot enough? pretty enough? skinny enough? funny enough? 
its depressing thinking these things but its possible... i mean everyones been somewhat ashamed to tell their friends something cuz they think it'll embarass them... but what if i am the current thing that he thinks could do that to him? now THAT would be horrible... i mean imagine if someone actually liked you but thought all this! 
*sigh* overthinking is pretty annoying... i mean it makes you always screw up a potentially good thing!!! i could be having the happiest time knowing that a guy i like actually likes me back and wants to do something about it in the future, but no, in my head i have to have a little battle about whether its really happening... i hate that!!! i hate that i cant just accept wats going on and be happy for myself once in a while!!! but thats just me and i can never really be happy... i will ALWAYS fuck up my own life"

"event","if ely doesnt go for it, i'm going for vice prez of boss for next year... the main thing that person does is semi, and i'll be the person who's been on semi committee for the longest... i was the only grade 10 on it last year and i'm back doing it again this year. I came up with this genius idea just recently to make people buy tickets and with cecilia's approval i'm going to make it happen. I really wish i had enough control to not need someone's approval on this, but ya, can't do anything about that til next year, when which i'm going to go nuts to be on boss.... hopefully i'll get on :)
w/e i'll miss a few dances, by then i'll have a g2 and i'll be able to get myself to clubs so i'm good :P

"event","Ok... maybe the true colours weren't as 'true' as i thought. We'll see how that one goes.

btw, anyone who actually reads this (although pretty much no one does :P) GO TO SEMI FORMAL!!! although no one listened to me when i said that we should have a fund raiser to lower the prices of semi tickets and now no one's buying cuz theyre too expensive... next year, i'm finding our vice prez during thesummer and getting them to sell something cold all thru the first month of school so that they can raise money to lower the semi tickets. I did the math (not thats its hard er anything... its somewhat logical) and in profits, we would need to make about $200 for every dollar we want to lower it. Thats kinda insane... but even like two dollars would make a huge difference, because when people see a four in the front of a number, they think OMFG thats expensive, but with a 3 as the first digit, people would be under the impression that it costs much less than it actually does. This would raise our sales and everyone's happy. 
My god, people should listen to me once in a while. Sure, i'm not creative, but thinking up things that can save money or make things easier... thats what i do! Being a cheapass comes in handy once in a while!!! but noooooo don't listen! and then lose money *sticks out tongue* 

w/e... next year will be different"

"event","So my day starts out with me waking up and as usual, i ly there for half an hour. Again, like every other day, i realize i'm late and spring out of bed. I run to the bathroom and get ready. 45 minutes later i emerge from my room ready to go, but i remember something from last night (nono dont think dirty). I realize that i have a math assignment i couldnt finish because barbra, adam and i didn't understand what to do. But then on a better note, i had very carefully prepared a set of ""in test notes"" for fish's test, which put me in a slightly better mood. 
I got to school and after about five minutes realized i needed to stall so that i wouldnt have to hand in my assignment. Thankfully, this was done for me when Fraschetti babbled a little and then let the vast majority of the class leave for the honour roll breakfast. There, me barbra and francine ate our stale cookies, day old muffins and airplane juice. Soon me and barbra remembered (again) that we had that math assignment so we ran back to math before anything even happened there (which apparently wasnt all that interesting and really didnt matter). We quickly asked other people how they got the answer and we wrote frantically until the announcements started.... thats when we realized we had done the question wrong and needed to redo it all. 5 minutes after everyone left, we were still stalling for time and writing insanely without him even realizing that we were doing our assignments which he asked for at the beginning of the period. We handed it in and ran off to the caf. There, nothign especially interesting happened except my drink took a life of its own and got on my audrey hepburn purse *tear* forcing me to bolt out of my seat to towards the bathroom to clean as much of it as possible. Thankfully it came off, so no one got hurt.
Next comes law, aced that test thanks to my hours of typing out all the definitions and methods in the two chapters.
Next is info tech, when which i get to be bored to tears by this 45 year old student teacher. I really think they should be setting an age limit on this. If the student teacher looks more like the teacher than the real teacher does, we know (s)he is too old. Now halfway through a boring powerpoint presentation, she gives us the best news i've heard in quite some time. THIS IS HER LAST WEEK THERE!!! no more idiotic ways of choosing groups, and proving facts. No more horribly slow answers that make you feel dumber by the time shes done. 
Lastly comes the worst economics class of my life. A certain person, who shall remain nameless, who i am forced to work with, decides to leave the class for 20 minutes when we only have one period to work on something that really cant be done in so little time. he comes back, sits down with his yearbook and continues to do nothing. eventualy the yearbook is taken from him by Mr Beswick and he takes all our information (which i happen to have brought)(no one else can spare 5 minutes of their precious time) and begins to write the most degrading, disgusting skit i've ever heard. When i dont laugh at this putrid piece of work, he begins to be increasingly more insulting. I get pissed pretty quickly and so that i dont have to kill the closest person to me, i get up and leave the class. I wander a bit and find one of my friends who is bored too and walk around for a bit. Eventually i go back, when which he's written even more of this turd, and expects me to simply accept it and recite it in front of the class. I tell him there is no way in hell i'm going to go say that, and i tell him where he can put this script of his. After 20 more minutes of his stupidity, Francine, Jamie and me leave our groups and walk to the front of the class to complain about how few braincells they seem to have. We decide that there is no way to participate, each for different reasons, and sit there and bitch for a little while. Hey, we're female, its what we do best (just kidding... no1 take offence!). 
After school comes DECA. I am quite literally the only person from my group who shows up and all the execs leave except Ely. So i'm sitting there trying to do this thing for the speech i will have to do soon, but my mind is filled with different methods in debating. Now i'm used to those by now, although i've only been in about four debates. I still know the fundamentals of their way of speaking and i try to apply this to DECA. Apparently, thats not how things work. Ely says theyre totally different styles, and learning both at the same time is pretty hard. He was on DECA first and debating second. 
Anyways i get home after this, realize i need to update adina and barbra on things with a certain person who doesnt yet have a nickname (well actually barbie, hes the one with the days...)(ev1 else, dun bother :P)
And so ends yet another boring day in the life of OWdree"

"event","You know, its weird... just as certain things resolve themselves, others mess up a bit. 
Well so a friend of mine told me that constantly telling people that i feel like i'll die alone is only making them think that i'm horribly desperate. I then realized that its not only doing that, but also making me think about the entire thing too much. So this is what i've decided to do. Let things go. Let w/e is supposed to happen happen. I'm alone now, and I'm fine with it, because now that i'm not looking for something good to come along, it has a chance to come. 
So welcome new opportunities, new ways of making myself happy. I'm ready now.

(btw, the bad thing would be a fight i had with one of my friends... but you know what? it helped me realize that theres no point to my complaining... some people have more to complain about and what i'm saying is just stupid)"

"event","well i've recently realized i use this livejournal for spilling emotion, not my feelings about specific situations therefore i've decided to give that a try and see how it will affect me. Maybe it'll help me get some things out that i only tell to two specific people.

Well lets start at the very beginning. There is one person who causes ongoing confusion for me, and tortures me emotionally. This person is one whom i share an unbelievable friendship with, one that is very hard to come across. With him i share anything from small talk about what happened during that day, to my deepest darkest secrets, to what we'll call ""benefits"". Now although this relationship may sound somewhat twisted, it really is one of the things that helps me be happy. Knowing that i can share literally everything with him is somewhat soothing. Now the situation in real life and going on in my mind that have to do with him are far too long winded and confusing to bother explaining therefore i will simply start out when i feel that there is no point to dwelling on the past, and move on. 

There are three potentials... one that we shall name mr. x, followed by mr. y and mr. z

First one that comes along is mr x., also known to many as hat. Everyone sees someone as pretty much just ""eye candy"" and not much more... well he's my eye candy. if there was one person who wasn't a celebrity who i was willing to look at for very long periods of time, i'd have to be him. Now due to his intelligence level or lack there of, i would never even consider acting upon this want. He will always remain my eyecandy, no more no less.

Next came mr y. He was an interesting case. One of my friends and i both took interest in him, and i think he was fully aware of both. After finding out that he might have a completely different third girl in mind, i decided to test things out and see what would happen. I ask him if he wanted to do something, which i think was mistaken for a friendly gesture as opposed to more. Schedules didnt match up, and i realized that certain things are worth the chase and this wasn't one of them. I quickly gave up and informed my friend that he was hers for the taking. Good luck to her, and i really hope it works out for them. They would be adorable together. 

And finally, my current consideration, mr. z..... Sadly, there is a mrs. z. and i'm going to have to wait this one out. Again, i'm wondering about whether its really worth, but unlike the previous one, i haven't yet decided. Mr. z. is in a completely different group of people than i am and therefore even considering it is even harder. I'm trying to see the state of this mr/mrs z relationship to see if the wait is close to 5 minutes or 5 years. I'm not yet sure but i will soon figure it out. I'm hoping that this one will work out.... i really wish i had someone right now to distract myself from all the crappy things going on outside my lack of a love life. I think i really need a distraction and certain situations my friends are having don't seem to really cut it. 

coming soon... OWdree's decision on mr. z and further mr x watching."

"event","what is this? is it rage? anger? longing? is it a result of months of loneliness, rejection and heartbreak? what have i come to, why must i feel like this? these and other thoughts pass through my mind as i begin to experience something i hate. something i despise more than pretty much all else. one emotion that i find totally useless is jealousy.
This stupid emotion takes over people and turns them against those whole truly matter. Friends, family, enemies... they all begin to blend into one category and you feel as if there is no difference between them anymore. 

But i think another twisted emotion is hatred of a person you don't even know DUE TO JEALOUSY. i mean for example, people hate celebrities because they're prettier, richer, are going out with some celebrity of the opposite sex that they want themselves... all of these dumb reasons cause us to feel such a strong emotion towards this person whom we've never encountered ONCE in our lives. Now obviously this doesnt only work with celebrities and only celebrities. Obviously people who we see on a daily basis who we haven't even talked to work the same way. There's always always something that people have that you don't. EVen the ugly nerd had his smarts which you'll never be able to match, the stupid tall model has her beauty, and everyone has their own thing in between.

Some people consider themselves to be above jealous, and think that either they can ignore or its so suppressed that it doesn't even count. well in case they're confused, ITS HUMAN NATURE!!! no matter how sick it is, no matter how much we wish it wasn't part of us, it is. TOUGH SHIT

it's part of me too... i hate it too.... and so begins another set of horrible pathetic and agrivating months, full of loneliness..."

"event","you know, you'd think that if you had most aspects of your life where you had problems all of a sudden fix themselves, you'd be happy. you'd think you'd at leats be content or satisfied.... but no... obviously i'm a horribly messed up and sick human being because there is one aspect that i seem to see as most important... except for my friendships with people, finding someone seems to be an endless quest for me. a quest that obviously is never going to find its end any time soon. its depressing seeing all those around you find someone who they like and likes them in return. i sit and watch from the sidelines wishing someone could think of me the same way, be willing to go after me the same way.... anything really... just show some interest....

apparently i have what many ppl have called single-o-phobia... i hate being alone... it makes me feel purposeless, pathetic, and then i do stupid things to fill this void. i hate the emptiness, the longing for something to happen. its possibly worse than rejection because honestly, i dont know the cause of it. am i ugly? should i work out more?? should i try to act differently? is there something wrong with me??? why is it that everyone around me has someone but i dont???

loneliness is my worst fear, and now, i get to experience it. day in and day out."

Now, proving the fact that certain 'barbie's are always right, i'm having a case of single-o-phobia. Now although i didnt go out with any1 til grade 9, since then its been somewhat consistent. every school dance that came around, i had some guy to drag to. now all of a sudden, thers this halloween dance coming up and i realize ""hey... i'm alone for a dance... this is weird...."". A certain big brown guy would know that i constantly complain about being alone proving i have a severe case of single-o-phobia, but i honestly thought i had it somewhat under control. Although i complain a lot about it, i didnt think i cared THAT much.... but now with only two weeks left until the halloween dance, i'm beginning to realize that i was wrong...

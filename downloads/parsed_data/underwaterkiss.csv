I mean first things with Josh are better now, and I just get so happy knowing that time really does solve things. Yeah it's taken a year for us to put things in the past but I remember as if it was yesturday how bad I wanted this day to come and I never thought it would. I guess you just gotta learn to have faith and let nature take it's course. Anyways well I'm very happy Amanda is more in my life again, Natasha, and Angela too!

"event","Mike came to my house. I know what everyone's probably saying omg your weak your back together with him, but I'm not. Everyones probably mad because ""I'm soo obsessed with him"". Well I got news for you, he is my best friend, He knows me better then most of you ever will and he was a big part of my life and he always will be. We are done, but he will still always be my friend and a tiny winy bit of my heart will forever love him. 
I can't stand these immature relationships where the people stop talking and hate each other because both of you fucking know you still care about the other person. 
Both of you still know your missing that person, and both of you still know it's taking twice as long as it should of to move on because you miss them so much. 
And both of you know it hurts so bad to tell the person you love that you hate them.
Well yeah shit will be hard we'll fight, we'll be mad, but we'll be friends. Best friends. 

Don't try and give me advice, on what I should do because this is between me and mike. But what you can do is be there for me, to listen when I need a friend. Don't stereotype mike or compare us to your past relationships, cuz it's not the same.
Mike is mike and I am me. 
If you follow your heart everything will be good.
I promise."

"event","I just realized somthing, I always tried to deny. But I can't any longer, I know why things ended the way they did. Everyone that knew us over summer predicted it warned us, but did we listen? ha. It was unavoidable. And as they say once you admit what the real problem is it's the first step to moving on or such. 

Another thing I realized, the more I keep trying to forget him well thinking of forgetting him is well thinking about him. Time solves everything.

ahh relization sucks, anyways I have to wake up at 6am cuz Britt wants breakfast stupid whore haha jk I love her."

Today was a good day, Brittany and Kellee came over and it was just a talk talk talk kinda day. We took mine and britt's dog to the park and talked. Todays the start of the new beginging.

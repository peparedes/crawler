"event","My officemate made me cry. Mababaw actually. She told me, I didn't know how to cry. I'm always spending time in my own world and neglecting reality. I guess I am. Sometimes, it sucks to be in the real world. 

Crying did me a whole lot of good. I was able to release 2 days worth of frustration. I guess running away and not acknowledging my problems only makes it harder for me to face them. I'm always choosing the easy way out not knowing it will cause more complications in the end. Looking back, I guess, she made me cry for that reason. I have to face what was happening. I wouldn't learn life's lessons if I keep on ignoring them or pretending they do not exist. 

Dreaming is good as long as I go back to Earth every once in awhile. One cannot live forever floating in the clouds."

"event","bakit ganon ang mundo? just when you need everything to run as smoothly as possible, that's when everything goes horribly wrong. 

murphy's law sucks. just like my life right now. i feel like i'm being pulled into eight different directions at once. there are too many concerns and problems i just want to scream and drop everything. if only we can get a rest from living. 

i've always believed that things happen for a reason. in a way i guess, i'm being taught a valuable lesson. i just hope life's lessons need not be always hard or painful. 

when i get depressed, i look for people. i try to forget. dwelling on the stuff that makes me sad only makes me feel pathetic. too bad there never is anyone around when i need someone to talk to. i end up dwelling on my problems instead. that or eating myself senseless. nothing like chocolates and ice cream to make me feel better.

i have to learn not to rely on other people that much.

"event","I always say that Im not the marrying kind. And yet I have a fascination for wedding ceremonies. I love watching original weddings where the bride and groom say their own vows. It makes everything more special, more heartfelt. It's so nice to marry not only the guy you love but also someone who will be your bestfriend. How I wish I can have the same.

I may not be the marrying kind. But when I do get settled down, it would be with someone I can honestly spend the rest of my life with."

"event","Mababaw. But it's so hard for someone to be forced to go against what they believe just to please doddering old fools who like their instructions followed to the letter. It's so hard to go against what you know is right and what you were taught all your life as right. Pasaway sila. It's almost like going against principles. Ang hirap. Mababaw pero parang pinaparusahan ako. Hirap na hirap ako. And I have no choice but to comply. Aaaaarggghhh.

Pero pag ako ang may nakitang butas at may nakitang mali, I'm not to do anything. Hayaan ko lang kasi di nila nakita yung nakita ko. Duh? Ang ewan na mga tao. Di sila tatagal sa mga kaklase ko. Subukan lang nila humarap sa panel made up of orcom's finest. Hmph!

I'm the one doing this, I'm the one forced to do what I don't want to do. But im not supposed to think. Im just have to do what they want. I'm not to think at all aarrrrrggghhhh. Talk about torture

I'm forced to do what I hate, and while I'm being forced to do it, I'm being made fun of. And they call this my family? Id rather be an orphan. They don't understand. And they don't even try to. I'm different and they think it a laughing matter. Pathetic fools. I'm glad I'm different. I'm glad I'm not like them one bit. And I'll never be like them. Ever. I hate them."

"event","grass is just grass. it's something cows eat. but it becomes something more when it bears witness to the countless picnics, field demonstrations, soccer practices, and university fairs. 

trees are just trees. they're useful for their shade. but they become something more when they line the paths that lovers take and become shelter for friendly confidences. 

chocolates not only taste good, they make you feel good. and they're even better when given by someone who cares. 

senti mode.

i just remembered my sister's homework. ""why do trees give inspiration?"" it's not the trees per se that inspire you. it's the things you connect to trees that give inspiration. the same way that certain things become important because of the story behind them.

i love evanescence. they say what i want to say.

it' s so hard not to be understood. some may say i had a lot of practice. i'm practically known for being different... i'm weird they say. but people who are close to you, who are actually related are supposed to understand no matter what. and if they don't understand, they'll try to. aaargghhh! 

""what makes you think your problem is bigger than everybody else's?"" 
""they're mine."" 

it was posted by a friend in his blog (from ally mcbeal). somehow it made me feel better. my officemates tell me that my problems are so ""kinder"" (elementary), they wish they had my problems. they meant it as a joke but it always hurt. who would want their troubles to be considered unimportant? at least now i know it's not. no matter how petty my affairs seem in the big world, it would always be important because it is mine. 

i'm gonna study again next sem. to hell with all the complications and disapproval. my sanity is more important than any argument they can come up with. i'll be what they expect me to be. i just need a few hours for me.

thank god for the trees and the grass and that special something that makes up diliman what it is. 

thank god for bestfriends who understand and try to if they don't."

As for me, the happening only begins by then. Sad cruel world. I always told myself that it's okay. I should be after years of this. But time doesn't make it only easier. It hurts still.

i had a nice time with my friends. we had a joint overnight birthday party. it's been a while since we last saw each other and it's quite refreshing to be in the company of people my age for a change. <lj-cut text=""we watched this korean movie that made us cry.""> we watched this korean movie that made us cry. it's about this little boy who was sent to live with his grandmother for a couple of days. his grandmother lived at the top of a mountain. the boy is a brat. we all hated him. he constantly plays tricks on his grandmother. hell, the grandmother is almost bent in two. she's that old. she's also not well off. she has to sell vegetables in this far off town just so she can eat. then add the fact that she's deadf-mute and her beloved grandson things she's dumb, stupid and nutty. the boy, being raised in the city kept demanding things from his grandmother that are not only expensive but also impractical to buy given the situation his grandmother is in. he kept hurting his grandmother not only physically (pushing her, hitting her) but also emotionally. he keeps doing mean tricks to her. he hides the only pair of shoes she has, making her go down the steep and rocky mountainside barefoot. he hides the comb she uses to keep her hair up and so she has to make do with an old spoon. one time, she took her grandson to the small town where she sells her vegetables. all the money she made that day was spent on buying her grandson rubber shoes (the leather ones he use hurt his feet) and feed him at a local restaurant. and yet all her sacrifices were lost on her grandson. when they went home, he didn't want his grandmother with him on the bus because the girl he was eyeing was also on the bus. he left her there and would not even get the stuff his grandmother wanted him to at least to carry for her. the boy got home and was pissed that his grandmother took so long in getting home. he stayed at the bus station at the foot of the mountain waiting for his grandmother. the buses came and went but no grandmother. he finally saw her (i think it was already the next day). she took so long coming home because she never took a bus. she walked all the way home, in her thin, old shoes (which has been mended by her countless of times) carrying the heavy parcel she wanted her grandson to take on the bus with him. it turned out that the bus the boy didn't want his grandmother to get on was the only one that she can board. how i hated the boy then. but i was to hate him even more. the boy wanted chicken from kfc. his grandmother understood that he wanted chicken. so she sold some stuff ( i dunno if it was more vegetables or some important stuff his grandma keeps) to buy a live chicken which she boiled. the boy didn't eat the chicken and told his grandmother that she was stupid. he wanted kfc and no other chicken would do. he didn't even consider that his grandmother went out even when it was raining just to get his chicken. when he got up in the middle of the night and got hungry, he ate the chicken anyway. grandma got sick that night. by this time all of us were either crying, wanting to strangle the boy or both. the boy, feeling bad tried to prepare breakfast for his grandmother. he wasn't really bad i guess. he just had issues. he lived in the city and was suddenly left in the care of this old woman who can't hear or speak. then he met the first girl he ever liked and he wanted to be the cool boy who came from the city who could do a lot of wonderful things. he didn't want to feel anything for his grandmother and didn't want to see her as anything but the old woman in the mountain. he did feel remorse everytime he hurt her. but then he acts first before he thinks. and he's too proud to say sorry and admit that he cares for his grandmother's feelings. when a letter came rom his mother that he will be picked up in a couple of days, i guess he decided to drop all pretenses of not caring. he wanted to teach his grandmother to write so that he'll know if she's sick or if something bad happened. i guess his grandmother can read but she really could not write. his grandson got frustrated so she just told his grandmother that she send an empty letter and he'll know that she was sick. the time came for the boy to leave. he pretended that he didn't care and just handed his grandma a small wrapped package. but when the bus began to move he looked back at his grandma and made the sign language for sorry. and when the grandma opened her grandson's gift, she saw that he made her little postcards that she can send him, each having a pre-written message. she could send one if she's sick or she misses him. i wish i had a grandma too while i was growing up. </lj-cut>"

"event","Soap operas and telenovelas are testaments to the fact that life offers us a helluva lot of coincidences. Lead female turns out to be the sister of the friend of the fiancee of the lead male. Their parents used to be either mortal enemies or lovers. Every character is related to the other character in one way or the other. Relationships become an ultra complicated spiderweb. I guess it just shows that you are destined to meet the people you do meet. One will discover upon looking back that if ever you did not cross paths when you did, another instance will lead you two together. Much like serendipity. Or destiny. Whatever works.

I used to wonder what would happen if I did not meet one of my old friends. If I did not meet him, I would not be who I am today. He helped me be who I am. Pretty abstract if you think about it. But is it possible for us NOT to meet? Our parents knew each other even before we were born. They used to live in the same vicinity. They went to the same high school. I guess you could say we were destined to meet. But then, if we were to meet in one way or the other then does that mean that it was also destined that I become who I am today? If we were destined to meet particular people for us to become who we are, then does that mean who we are and what we will be is also destined? Whatever.

Okay. Too much thinking. Not good.

My life is way boring. An old schoolmate asked me how I was. And there was nothing to say. I went to work during the day and slept at night. Saturdays was for sleeping till noon (with a 30 min break for shaman king) and Sundays was for computer class. I'd try to break the monotony but what the hell, I'm too lazy to make an effort. 

Okay. I'm gonna make a new year's resolution. I'll resign first quarter of next year. Goodluck.

I'm to perform at the division christmas party. What got into me? I usually worked in the sidelines, planning, organizing but never in the limelight. Eversince I started working I have performed twice in front of a huge crowd I didn't even know. Wahahaha. It must be the start of my career in showbiz. 

At least my dreams are as entertaining and impossible as always.

""You are braver than you believe
Stronger than you seem
And smarter than you think.""

I need to remember that. It would do wonders for my self esteem.

<lj-cut text=""Forever and Ever?""> 

Pooh, there's something I have to tell you
Is it something, nice?
Not, exactly
Then it can wait
It can, for how long?
Forever and ever

Forever and ever
Is a very long time Pooh
Forever isn't long at all
When I'm with you

I wanna call your name, forever
And you will always answer, forever
And both of us will be
Forever you and me
Forever and ever

I wanna stay like this, forever
If only I could promise, forever
Then we could just be we
Forever you and me
Forever and ever

Forever and ever
Is a very long time Pooh
Forever isn't long at all, Christopher
When I'm with you

I wanna be with you, forever
I want you right here beside me, forever
One thing you should know
No matter where I go
We'll always be together
Forever and ever

</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Wherever you are...""> 

Come out moon
Come out wishing star
Come out, come out
Wherever you are

I'm out here in the dark
All alone and wide awake
Come and find me
I'm empty and I'm cold
And my heart's about to break
Come and find me
I need you to come here and find me
'Cos without you I'm totally lost
I've hung a wish on every star
It hasn't done much good so far
I can only dream of you
Wherever you are

I'll hear you laugh
I'll see you smile
I'll be with you
Just for a while

But when the morning comes
And the sun begins to rise
I will lose you
Because it's just a dream
When I open up my eyes
I will lose you
I used to believe in forever
But forever's too good to be true
I've hung a wish on every star
It hasn't done much good so far
I don't know what else to do
Except to try to dream of you
And wonder if you are dreaming too
Wherever you are

Wherever you are

</lj-cut>

I love Winnie the Pooh's Grand Adventure. *beams*"

"event","Today, my beloved cousin goes back home. But where is home? Home is where you are happy. He has never been happy there. I believe that the two months he spent here on vacation felt more like home than the three years he spent there. I feel his pain at leaving. At it hurts even more that I have to be the rational voice even though I feel exactly like he does. I want him here. I need him here. And yet I'm the one who tells him that he has to go back. It's ironic that the person who wants him here the most is also the one telling him to go.

He left and I never got to say goodbye. It hurts. I wanted to hug him and whisper just how much I'm going to miss him. I didn't get to see him off because of work. My tears began to fall as soon as I realized I cannot say goodbye. The only good thing about it is that I didn't make a fool out of myself at the airport.

When he texted me to say he was boarding the plane, I felt so alone. No more ""chuckie mornings"" and late night confidences. No more hugs. No one to wipe my tears away. No one to make me laugh when I feel like crying. Sure, there's ym and phone calls and webcam. But it can never replace having him hold me and hug me. I miss him already.

It took me years to gain whatever freedom I had. I had to sacrifice a lot of things to get where I am. It's so hard to make younger people understand that what I'm doing will eventually save their butts and allow us more freedom in the future. They tend to think only of the now. Then they hate me.

I especially liked this friend of his that reminded me of Naruto. He is a ninja wannabe that has the same interests as I do. Too bad he's way younger and he's got his heart set on someone else. Hahahaha. Pedophile tendencies.

Kidding aside, I like the guy since I somehow see myself in him. He is going through the same things I went through before. And things are even harder for him since he got additional issues to face. And he doesn't have anyone to help him. He doesn't have anyone to talk to. He keeps things to himself. He keeps pretending that everything is okay. One can't keep that kind of existence. One day, you'll just explode.

"event","I think too much sometimes. Bad.

<lj-cut text=""I..."">
I am confused. I'm not sure where my life is going.

I think of the most absurd things. i've got a weird mind.

I know that everything has a purpose. Things happen for a reason. 

I want the answers to my questions. but then, as the saying goes, just when you finally have the answers, they suddenly change the questions. 

I have to think of myself more. Ilang taon ko din napabayaan ang sarili ko.

I wish I realize what i have before i lose it. i only see the importance of something after i lose it.

I hate myself most of the time. i always mess up at the worst times. but then, as they say, you should first love yourself to be able to love others. so now, i hate the fact that i hate myself.

I miss walking around upis after classes. i miss the way the sun dances on the trees at lovers lane, skipping in the tree covered lane across upis (ala yellow brick road sa wizard of oz). i miss lunch at thadde (eating lunch standing up/without a table, exchanging tsismis, cramming homework, playing with the cats/with each other, drawing anime, playing the recorder/bamboo flute). i miss seeing everybody everyday.

I miss UP Manila, robinsons, the tambayans, the chika sessions with favorite professors, the girl talks, the sleepovers, the group works, the parties, heart to heart talks, early morning and early evening snacks... everything.

I fear being alone. i have this fear that everyone will leave me. that and heights. i hate heights.

I feel tired. parang laging kulang ang oras sa isang araw. lagi akong napapagod.

I hear voices in my head. that and music. hehehe... medyo psycho ata ako.

I crave chocolates. sobra.

I wonder why everything becomes so complicated when it isn't really. we should all be like kids. take things as it is. try not to complicate everything.

I regret letting go of some people who are worth more than the people i held on too. that's one thing i'll regret for the rest of my life. i wish i can undo some of the choices i made...

I love people. sometimes i love them too much. i also love anime and books and detective/mystery fiction and stuffed toys and bishounens and letters and surfing the net and reading/writing fanfics and a lot of other things. i love too much and it always gets me hurt in the end.

I ache whenever i see some of the stuff i keep and remember the memories that go along with them. i'm a real senti person. i cry over leaves and ribbons and pictures and old letters.

I long for happiness. when you're happy, you'll have everything even when you have nothing.

I care about a lot of things. i care about my friends, about certain beliefs i have, about a number of things. when i believe in something, i believe with all my heart.

I always try to be happy. i just hope i succeed one of these days.

I am not sure where i'm going or where my life is leading. but that's part of the wonder that is life.

I believe that dreams do come true. you just have to wish hard enough, and work hard enough. it's not one or the other but both.

I dance whenever i hear music. actually, it's more of sway than dance. i have to move whenever i hear music.

I sing when it becomes too quiet for me, or whenever i hear music. i can't sing but i love to sing.

I cry whenever i remember something real sad, whenever i'm scared. i cry when i'm real mad, when saying goodbye to someone dear.
 
I do not always like company. sometimes, it's relaxing to spend time with myself.

I fight whenever it's too much. or when i'm not in the mood. pero most of the time i'm a peace loving person.

I write when i'm happy, when i'm sad, when i'm mad. i write whenever, wherever about anything, everything.

I win this should be ""i hardly win anything"". i don't know... i just don't.

I lose the things i try so hard to keep...

I never wanted to be bad. but i am, most of the time.

I confuse things all the time. or rather, ""i'm confused most of the time"". i am. my blockmates like to call me windang coz that's what i am most of the time. 

I listen to music. to tsismis. to a lot of things. kaya lang bingi ako. *sweatdrops*

I can usually be found with people. i like hanging out with people. or under trees. or in the lobby. or somewhere high (pero i still hate heights!). 

I am scared that no one will love me.

I need someone who'll try to understand me even though he doesn't (ang important, yung ""trying"" part). i'm a person who needs understanding... kasi i'm hard to understand. (nyek! ang gulo)

I am happy that's one thing i try to tell myself all the time. ""i'm happy"". who knows, one day i just might be.

I expect a lot from myself. i just hope, i live up to my expectations. bad. pero it's better than living up to other people's expectations.

I should fix my life. it's going nowhere.
</lj-cut>

Lots of stuff come in threes. I wonder why.

<lj-cut text=""Three things..."">
THREE THINGS THAT SCARE ME: 

01 | dying with no one mourning me
02 | having someone i love die on me
03 | being a failure


THREE PEOPLE GROUPS WHO MAKE ME LAUGH: 

01 | my cousins (olee in particular -- he's such a funny guy -- have you heard of nora at ang patis story?)
02 | thadde (especially during our weird moments -- who cares kung weird tayo... masaya naman) and my other UPIS friends
03 | my blockmates (we laugh over the weirdest things... basta it's like we're having fun all the time)


THREE THINGS i LOVE: 

01 | letters from friends... long ones... it's something you can keep to remember days gone by
02 | hugs -- makes me feel loved and all warm inside
03 |  friends -- they make me happy


 THREE THINGS I HATE: 

01 | brothers that don't act like brothers (makes me wish that i have a kuya)
02 | people that judge... eh wala naman silang karapatan. they see only one side... 
03 | paradoxes -- ang hirap na nga intindihin ng mundo, lalo pang pinahirap.


THREE THINGS I DON'T UNDERSTAND: 

01 | why some people are the way they are. i don't understand how they can be like that and be allowed to live
02 | why i fall for the wrong people and let the right people go
03 | why my stuff disappears -- wala lang. nawawala na lang sila bigla. wala namang kumukuha.


THREE THINGS I WANT TO DO BEFORE I DIE: 

01 | find the ""right one""
02 | have people forgive me (for all the wrong i've done) 
03 | be able to say goodbye properly to those i love


THREE WAYS TO DESCRIBE MY PERSONALITY: 

01 | weird at laging windang
02 | hyper at bubbly
03 | inquisitive at mahilig mag-dig ng out of the way facts


THREE THINGS I CAN'T DO: 

01 | keep still (i need to move or talk, or i'll go crazy)
02 | sing... i'm tone deaf (i need someone to sing with me to produce a half way decent sound)
03 | dance (para akong posteng pinagpipilitang itumba ng hangin)

"event","I was talking with my officemate about work troubles and how normal it is for newbies like us to commit them. And what do I do as soon as we got clients? I mess up. And to make matters worse, I piss of the same client I already pissed off a couple of months ago. Aaarghhh. The woes of the working class. And that streak of bad luck persisted the whole day. 

I'm sick of what I'm doing. So why don't I leave?Because I want to make sure that when I do leave, my life will still remain on track, have a purpose and direction. I don't want to return to the limbo I was in before, adrift, floating aimlessly. I've been doing that for most of my life. No need to keep doing it."

"event","My favorite cousin will be visiting in a couple of days. I miss him so much. I adored him a lot when he was a kid. Even more so now. It seems that the distance made us even closer than before. He's the only one I can share stuff with because we understand each other completely. We went to the same school and grew up in the same environment. He's the only one who can appreciate certain sentiments I have over what other people would consider trivial. I miss him and I'm so glad he's coming home. 

Talk about mood swings.

I shouldn't be on right now. I've been going on almost every night. Bad for the eyes. But if I didn't, I'd go crazy."

"event","There's this guy that never fails to piss me off. He doesn't have to do anything special. Just the mere fact that he's living and breathing in the same space as I am gets me riled up. Aaaarghh! He's so annoying. And I'm not the only one with the same reaction towards him. Having him around ruins my mood. I'm okay as long as he keeps away. And he wont! ANNOYING! And he keeps messing up which in turn messes up MY WORK! Grrr! How I wish he'd disappear. Or I get another job. That way I'll be rid of him. Dimwit. That's exactly what he is. I have low tolerance for people who let their brains rot... what little they DO have. Aaaarhhh!!!

I'm bad. I hate very few people. But when I do, I hate them with a vengeance for no apparent reason. Too bad he got included in the elite circle. And I'm allergic to his perfume. It makes me sneeze. Another reason why he should keep himself scarce.

There. I finally got that out. I feel better."

"event","I saw a rerun of Shaman King this morning. I'm so happy I caught that particular episode because it's the first one with my beloved Horohoro in it. *sigh* He's so kawaii as always. Especially when he's all serious or real determined. I know he's got a relatively low furyoku and can be real idiotic at times. But I love him to bits and he'll always be the best for me. 

Hmm.. what is it with me and idiotic and/or insane guys?

*hears Apple-chan shouting in the distance ""It's because you're weird!*

Uh, ok. 

I love snow. Who cares if I live in the tropics? (By the way... is the Philippines a tropical country? I should've paid more attention in class instead of thinking up stories.)

I love snowboards. Especially the one that lights up, has a koropokkuru (is that the right spelling?) fused with it and is owned by a blue haired kawaii ainu.

I shouldn't have watched Shaman King again. I've been humming Trust You the whole day. People have been giving me weird looks.

Tomorrow, I go back to the routine that is my life. No anime, no daydreaming till the weekend. 

Horohoro, my overgrown dalmatian is howling at the balut vendor. Yup. Howling. No barks for the poor balut vendor. Old wives tale suggests that dogs howling means certain doom for the intended person. I'd say it's just Horohoro wanting to exercise his voice. He's still a puppy even though he's already bigger than his mother.

I wonder, does my ice shaman howl too?

Hmm. Food for thought."

"event","I'm not feeling anything today. It's as if I'm floating somewhere and separate from my body. I should be sad. I guess I am. That and disappointed. But I'm not showing signs of feeling those things. I wonder why.

My brother did a real awful thing. Something I thought he would never do. And something i know I would never do. I guess, being the big sister and remembering him as the sweet boy he once was made me think that he wont do such a thing. It's weird how love (eek! I admitted I loved him. Eww!)can make you blind to you loved one's faults. He's no saint, sure. But I never knew he was capable of something like that.

Okay. still not feeling anything. 

Must be the icecream. Hmm.. icecream with choco syrup, marshmallows and choco chips on top. Yummy.

Tomorrow is father's day. And since I'm confessing how much I love people, I guess I should say that I love my dad. I admire him for doing the things he does and hate him for being narrow minded at times. Hahaha. Pretty balanced, I should say. Sure to keep things interesting.

There's this woman and her little boy that sat beside me as I was on my way home. The little boy was only 2 years old and real adorable. He kept talking to me the whole of the trip. Kawaii! And when I had to get off, he waved and said goodbye. Real cute. I want a little boy of my own. Really. I'd love him so much. I like little boys!

Okaay. If my friends could hear me, they'd say I'm pedophile tendencies are showing again. Hahahaha. I beg to disagree. It's called maternal instinct.

So many boys so little time. I say boys regardless of age or maturity. A 25 year old guy can be a boy and a 16 year old guy can be a... a person. Get my drift?

I wonder? Is my future hubby a boy? Hmm... I hope so. If not and I was only led to think he was... there's always divorce! *maniacal laughter*"

"event","I only had three hours sleep. There's nothing like fatigue to ruin your whole day. Add to that weird occurences and annoying organisms (I won't call them people) and you get one hell of a day.

Grr.

I seriously think I'm developing a mean and sarcastic personality. And I'm not entirely to blame. Try smiling all day at people you want to strangle.

Waaah.

I like psychology. It's a nice interesting study. But psychologist wannabes that feel as if they're the be all and end all of civilization ought to be buried under ten feet of rubble. Just because they have a few units, it doesn't mean that they can poke at you and consider you a curiosity if you fall below their expectation. Duh? I have a few units myself and I don't treat other people  inferior. I have a right to be different. It doesn't make me a reject.

Even my rants don't make sense. Arggghhh!!!

Anyway, I went to this bookstore and stayed there a good solid hour. Nothing like good ole books to calm me. Then I bought this trilogy I've fallen in love with back in highschool. So now I feel better. 

I feel better. Too bad it can't make everything alright as well. <sigh> Gotta go. I have to rest. I feel like I'm coming down with something."

"event","I have decided to start a live journal. Why? Because lots of things are happening and are not happening that I want to remember everything. I need documentation in order to remember things. I haven't much of a memory. I tend to repress or alter stuff in my mind so its best if I write it down so as to not confuse myself in the future. I've got blog before. But what the hell? Live journal looks more fun than blog.

I've always complained that life sucks... mine in particular. Now I don't know why I ever thought it was when it certainly is more hellish now. I don't believe that hell is one big inferno. Well it can be if you happen to be a polar bear. I believe that hell is everything that makes you miserable, hopeless and other negative stuff. 

I'm in the stage of my life where I have to decide on a lot of things that will decide what my future will be. And it's scary. I've always been the type of person that lives in my fantasies. If the real world sucks, then I move on to another world. People seem to think that I treat serious things quite lightly. I don't seem to get affected by the stuff I experience. Maybe. But then, I never dwell on them. I escape. Not bad if you think about it. But eventually I have to go back and face reality and that's when everything becomes hell.

I want to go back to school. Everything is so much simpler then. Riding the rollercoaster that is my emotions is way easier than riding the bus of life. Eeek. What the hell am I saying? Gotta go. I'm being weird."

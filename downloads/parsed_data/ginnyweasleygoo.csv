All the hormonal bitching about rather stupid things sort of pisses me off, and i thought l'd start a new lj, seeing as l've changed so much. 
Not that the new lj is going to be all hormonal tantrum-less.. just hopefully about bigger things when i do bitch. 

I'm not gonna delete this one or anything, it'll still be there for the records. :p Like an old diary..

Anywho, i need a new name.. suggestions? I would go with the 'goosiegoo' just cos it's my.. account name thingy, and l'd like a new lj to have a name that i won't grow out of too fast... haven't grown out of goosiegoo yet.. :p

Unless i can think of something really witty. Heh. 

Anywho, i shall inform you when l've made it.. so you can all befriend me."

I was very happy. 1 band 6 and 4 band fives.. which is actually better than a lot of the brainy kids. :p Cept like Kiri and Rob. Who got 3 band 6's. *mutters*

Anyway... YAH!! The only one l was a bit angered by was English. :p I wish i'd gotten higher.. even though thats stupid. Well Zoe beat me! :p And she's the maths one.. I'm the english one. :p But still, she did very well. 2 band 6's 2 band 5's and 1 band 4. I was very happy that she got a band 6 in maths, she deserved it. And as usual our scores manage to equal out to about the same average. :p 

Anywho..

YAH!!!

I was also happy that my SC report says that l have drama for 200 hours with an A. :p Cos i got straight a's in drama..

No, no.. it's alright. I had a quite good last day of being fifteen.. until this arvo. But in gymnastics, alll year l've had those mental problems where my legs won't let me jump :p and l've really wanted to do a handspring (you know l found out that zoe thought a backward summersault was a backflip. Thats just common sense to me!) but the creepy thing about handsprings is that you have to jump..and then flllyyy, land on your hands on the mat and then land on your feet. :p Well, yes, my mind hasn't been letting me jump onto my hands cos the last time l did it l like..dived. Onto my neck. 
Anyway, so today Shaye says ""No Grace! You're going to do it! And you're going to jump and land on your hands and land on your feet!"" 

AND I DID!!! YAH!!!

I used to be able to do it.. and l can do it again! Incredible achievement for grace, mentally. 

So l decided that was a rockin' way to leave my 15 yearoldness behind, and also decided that l was growing..mentally. :p 

But then I got home. :( And Buttercup (one of the cows) has been really crappy..like hasn't been able to walk much, and dad called the vet while l was out and the vet put Buttercup down. :( And she's getting taken away tomorrow morning.. what a nice way to wake up on my birthday. I've requested that they let me sleep in until it's over. 
And I just saw Horney (don't laugh at the name.. she has horns.) sitting there..looking all alone. :( And it was saddd. The vet said she isn't very well either.. *pouts*
But they're pretty old cows.. and they've had a good life of.. eating grass... grazing.. etc.

So.. Blah.

Oh, and my camera hasn't arrived so l prob won't get to take pics on my birthday. :( But thats alright..l'll live.

"event","Rennie and Dad are back from Egypt! 
It's weird...feels like they didn't go anywhere. 
Rennie had the funniest stories about Dad.. and their tour leader, Emad seems so funny. Hes like a really..big..buff guy that was extremely competitive, and was the national champion in kick boxing and table tennis (hmm) :p but he was all ranting about hwo if anythings wrong he'll go to all lengths to fix it and being really nice. And Dad won a game of pool against him and Emad was soo mad. :p 
But Rennie was going on about how everyone really liked Rennie and Dad, but they didn't know how to react to Dad..cos he was really normal most of the time, and then he'd do something really weird. Like..they were all sitting around and someone said ""Oh, this heat is so..stupid.."" And Dad stands up really suddenly and says ""Well you know whats stupid?!!? Wearing bright purple socks under my sandals!!!"" and he takes them off and everyone laughed, and he swimmers on underneath his clothes..and he goes ""oh, like that do you!"" and takes of his pants with the swimmers underneath..and no one new he had swimmers underneath and l don't know..when rennie told it it was sooo funny...

And l think on of the funniest stories was how he was on a plane, and they give them packs with like..toothpaste, and a a toothbrush, shaving cream, etc...and he was ranting on about how he had used this shaving cream yesterday, and it wa just so refreshing..and he kept patting his face and going 'it was just so refreshing..it must have some sort of asian minerals in it...it was just so refreshing..l mean it took awhile l foam up.."" and Rennie finally took the shaving cream he was holding and looked at and goes ""oh, you thought this was so refreshing? It's toothpaste.."" and he wasn't embarrased at all, he just kept on with the refreshing.. *hysterics* *sigh* He'll never live down shaving with toothpaste...

And what was the other one rennie told me? Funny thing about Dad...sposedly he was really terrible at text messaging, and he'd go out onto the balcony of the hotel saying he was gonna send a text message, and then come back 15 minutes later asking if rennie would send it for him...

But yeah, those were most of the funny stories..

Now, for the most important part..presents! That was a joke. 

I got... this really beautiful, really thin glass perfume bottle, now l need some perfume..
2 egypt-ie necklaces, you know the ones made by..like..peasants and stuff. :p
A proper muslim woman scarf, very pretty..
Some teal beads that are awesome-o
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets in Arabic!!!!!! to start my collection! :D
Not a present..but l got an egyptian pound for getting rennies bag, and a few malaysian dollars and an american dollar..
and the best one of all..This chain, with a really beautiful..thingy no it, which has...my name engraved in HEIROGLYPHICS!!!! It's so awesome!!!  And it has a heiroglyph alphabet..must write out all your names for you.. 

EEEE!!!


Anyway, l haven't seen pictures yet, but l havce to go study. 

Woot!"

It's really sad...but l can sort of handle the thought of her passing on. What l can't handle is seeing her just lying there not being able to do anything whenever l look out the kitchen window. And l keep remembering how l was the first one to see wobbly after she was born..
I just wish everything crap would stop happening and we could go back into the happy bits.."

"event","My school is dull brained. If they think they can get me with a simple ""Oh no, we're not doing drama for yr 11 2006. Sorry, ther are only 11 people"" Get over it. Fools. I didn't even hear it from an official. Heard it from Ms Mason who was very upset about it. 
Well theres no point being upset. We are doing Yr 11 drama. 
The plan of attack goes as follows:
1. tomorrow Ms Mason talks to the principal about the matter
-if that doesn't work..-
2. Parents of as many people possible who chose drama ring up and complain about it. 
-if that doesn't work..-
3. Todd and I, and prob Rosemary go to Mr Tome and complain. If need be Todd will be on queue to cry. :p I'm not brave enough to cry. 
-if that doens't work..-
4.Then come the petitions, campaigns and protests. Badges, signs, posters, we'll try and go to the news... We say that OHS is discriminating against Drama. 

Our argument:

1. OHS should try their hardest to give us the subjects we need to persue our careers. You have unbelievable difficulty trying to get into an acting uni without HSC drama. 
2. The fact that we only have 11 students is not a good enough reason to stunt our career choices. 
3. They're running music 2 with 3 people! But they are adding it into music 1, but it still makes it more difficult than just opening drama. DISCRIMATION AGAINST DRAMA!!!
4. They're helping out canobolas by letting their phsyics students join in with ours, because canabolas doesn't have enough. and..um..they can't even give us a drama class? 
5. We have a capable teacher who WANTS to take the class.
6. Yr 12 2003 had 13 drama students. 
7. We damn well have the right to do drama!!!

Damn School."

The bow (reply) is because your comments are like gifts!!

And l'm in a bit of a drunk mood. 

When l look at the layout..it looks a bit sad/depressed..yes? well..i'm not sad/depressed. I just wanted a colour change. And l can even have a different av for every update! Woot! But the av's look sad too. :p Hmm..

"event","I got into peer support! *woots* Supposedly Mrs Paine told Mrs Lil how good l was. She's so lovely. :p So thursday and friday (syd's birthday!) l'll be at untiting church doing my peer support training. And l have to miss out on the greek banquet. :(

Umm..highlights of today? 
I'm thinking of joining as a reserve on the yr 10 debating team, even though l don't want to anymore. :p And..umm..hmm. I was joke-arguing with zoe all day. :p and ended up writing 'zoe drinks he own pee' on the desks in maths. :D

And..there were these really odd boys, you know how you do that thing where one person puts there arms behind their back, and another person stands behind them and have to be their arms? 
Well there were these two yr 11 guys, one had his arms in his jumper and the other was standing behind him with his arms through the arm holes (looked really odd) and l was walking through the yr 11 area and...they came up to me, zoe and rosemary and pointed to me, and then hugged me. And l was taken by surprise and shocked, and then he pointed in another direction and said 'leave!' so l was laughing and walking off...and then he followed me and everytime l went to laugh or talk he would touch my nose and go 'shh' - and l was cacking my self. Then he left it with 'hug me'. So l hugged him. and he told me to leave, so l left..and everyone around was hysterical, like me. it was so odd. And funny.

And, l heard off Rachel, that these 6 kinross boys caugh chlymidia of this one OHS girl. And l'm like..6 boys caught it off one girl?! What?! and supposedly it's going through kinross, canobolas, OHS and Shean, year 10-12 and some year 9's. I don't know if it's true..but its the gossip l got from Rachel. So no sleeping around!

Anyway...YAY! I don't have any tests...scheduled. They're all over for..atleast a bit! Cos l have my trials in 4 WEEKS. and it's just revision now, basically. 

Trimester ends this week..l hope l get changed english classes, which l won't be. Cos they don't change anyone..

Anywho, l best be off.

edit: 

ARGH! i Hate people!!!!! I can't believe the story rennie just told me!
Claire and Kristy, rennie's friends, were at the servo on friday night - and they saw this 13 yearold girl run past them and hide somewhere, followed by these two seventeen yearold girls..and they found her..and just grabbed her and started bashing her up! One of them was Molly from yr 11, who is a big skank..but l mean. ARgh! They were like..bashing her head into a brick wall..and broke her nose, and finally when this 13 yearold was lying in a pool of her own blood (while molly was still kicking her in the face) Claire and Kristy went to go call the police and when the police came, they ran away! And the girl looked half dead! If they had have kept on going they could have killed her! The ambulence people said she would be alright, she just lost a lot of blood...
but argh! I'm digusted, and angry and what a stupid frigging whore! 
I didn't know the girl...but it just makes me so mad that these sort of things happen! Luckily Claire and Kristy got to fill out a statement to the police..and there were heaps of witnesses...so she might get sent to juvi..forever..

Argh!"

Umm..news for today? 

Gave Lockie my number after his complaining, and I'm scared of what he's gonna send me. :p He's an odd boy. 

And..umm... we were in town and saw evan jackson and l did a majorly classy *cough* 12 o'clock! *cough* to zoe. hehehe. 

Oh, the performance was terrible! We weren't ready at all and l forgot my queue, and it was a rehearsed reading so l was sposed to have a script! So l sit there, looking at everyone as if they should talk..then look at eves script..go back to looking at people..shuffle through eves script..then finally realise my line and go ""What do we do now? [i]sorry![/i]"" to the audience. :p *bangs head on table*

But supposedly people have been telling todd to tell me 'good job' hmm.. I did not think so. Lets hope l'm over exaggerating. :p

Oh, and yesterday..Jay and Brayden have been collecting10 cent pieces for charity, so everytime l see Jay he asks me for money and l never had it. So l finally had it..and l go and do the whole 'hand shake' money thing, and he was very happy..:p and he hugs me, kisses my cheek and then LICKS MY FACE! *shudders* twas a terrible experience. *shakes head* and then he's like. ""No, I'm sorry..l won't do it again.."" And tries to hug me again. and l'm like NOO! :p

And so it ended and we all thought it was funny, but Emma puts on Stop..and everyone got in a line and started singing and doing that actions (with me blowing bubbles) and the bell had rung so everyone was waiting outside the room for rolecall, and the music was up loud so you coulkd hear it from the other side of the school and it was just sooooo fun!! everyone just knew the words and actions. 

And..umm..well. I went to the orthodontist and l only have to wear my plate half time now! yay! everyone can see my teeth at school..*celebrates* and none of the fuss of bringing my plate case everywhere. Yay-ful-ness!!

You say you want a revolution 
Well, you know 
We all want to change the world 
You tell me that it's evolution 
Well, you know 
We all want to change the world 
But when you talk about destruction 
Don't you know that you can count me out... in 
Don't you know it's gonna be all right 
Don't you know it's gonna be all right 
Don't you know it's gonna be all right 
Ah 

You say you got a real solution 
Well, you know 
We'd all love to see the plan 
You ask me for a contribution 
Well, you know 
We're doing what we can 
But when you want money 
for people with minds that hate 
All I can tell is brother you have to wait 
Don't you know it's gonna be all right 
Don't you know it's gonna be all right 
Don't you know it's gonna be all right 
Ah 

You say you'll change the constitution 
Well, you know 
We all want to change your head 
You tell me it's the institution 
Well, you know 
You better free you mind instead 
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao 
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow 
Don't you know it's gonna be all right 
Don't you know it's gonna be all right 
Don't you know it's gonna be all right 
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 
all right, all right, all right 
all right, all right, all right 
all right, all right, all right 
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 
all right, all right

"event","<P>Yay! Back with more art! I found a really great tutorial on coloring and how to do lineart for photoshop elements (which is what I have). So, I was doodling around and came across a fun image in the end (though ya know, not the greatest). But I scanned it anyway, and tried out my hand at the whole digital coloring. Um..lol... Lets just say... I'm allowed to use the excuse it was my first time. :D</P>

"event","<P>Okay, this is basically the same picture as the rose I did yesterday, except that I wasn't really liking at one petal off to the side. Thought maybe it might look better if I took it off. So here's how it looks without it. ^_^</P>

"event","<P>Hey. More practicing. So here we have rose #2. I don't think it's quite as good as the first one. But then again, I did this by just looking at a pciture of a rose. And I think that drawing something tthat's colorful is much harder when you're just using a pencil than drawing something that's in black and white because when it's in b+w you get a better sense of shading and such. But anywho, here it is.</P>

"event","<P>Ok, so here is a rose I drew just now. It isn't the greatest I'll admit, but it is my first one and I'm fairly excited. ^_^ I've decided to draw Jennifer a picture message thing for her birthday. I admit it is partially because I have no money, but also because I always prefer to give gifts that I think people will really like and Jenn is always asking me to draw her a picture. So, woo.</P>

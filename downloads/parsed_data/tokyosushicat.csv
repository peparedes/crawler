"event","How to begin.  Not an opening but a question.  How to begin?  I am lost without the trusted skills that get me through the day.  I am in a fairytale but it's real and I have everyting I want but I'm not happy yet.  why.  What's wrong.  Don't complain.  Make it work.  Be somebody, but who.  Be a point of light. and care about where to go next.  I've sort of lost my desire for anything.  Exept chocolate, thank god for that.  I pick fight with my prince just to talk in my own language.  wow.  this life is weird and everybody on TV is really weird.  Fear is totally new because I don't get nervous anymore because I'm afriad of everything all the time, even buying choclate, but I have to buy it because it's an addiction, so it's my savior and obsession. Tee hee.  I really feel like getting drunk or something, I miss doing unhealthy things.  Sigh.  I don't really have enough control overy my life to do anything unhealthy, tee hee.

I'm scared all the time and I don't know what I really want.  I'm scared all the time but I don't know what I'm scared of.  Me I guess.

Oh Well.  At least I can download Grey's Anatomy.  I guess I like that.  Maybe I just have to many expectations for myself."

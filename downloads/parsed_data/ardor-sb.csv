"event","i'm not a big fan of korean dramas, so i can count the dramas i've seen after i came here with my fingers.. however, i recently added one drama to that list, which is full house. how i watched this is funny cause i came to watch this when i visit karen's place for dinner. she's my senior labmate and chinese. after dinner she suggested to watch it together. it was true that korean dramas are famous for many asians. hihi.

anyway, i finished watching everything the day after i visited karen.. i spent the whole day starring the monitor with red eyes.. hehe. i just can't watch one and wait a week for next ones.. 

i watched the original comics, and now i understand why there was a huge debate about song hekyo's character. i also prefer the original character.. they turned the original character into a typical romance novel character.. :(

p.s. after watching it, i sometimes tie my hair to the side, and my husband asked if it's a trend these days. i asked why and he answered that he met one of his friends with his girlfriend and she had the same hair.. kuhaha. she must have seen it too."

"event","A long weekend has arrived, I mean, almost. What to do? I have a long wish list, but I guess mostly likely I'll spend most of the time reading and writing. However, I'll do make a time for a relaxing time on the beach watching dogs.. :)"

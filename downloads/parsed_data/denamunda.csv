I still hear your voice, when you sleep next to me. I still feel your touch in my dreams. Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why. Without you it's hard to survive. 

Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling and everytime we kiss I swear I could fly. Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last. Need you by my side. Cause everytime we touch, I feel this static. And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky. Can't you hear my heart beat slow. I can't let you go. Want you in my life.

Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky. They wipe away tears that I cry. The good and the bad times, we've been trough them all. You make me rise when I fall. 

Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling and everytime we kiss I swear I could fly. Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last. Need you by my side. Cause everytime we touch, I feel this static. And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky. Can't you hear my heart beat slow. I can't let you go. Want you in my life.

"event","Hmmmm whats new these days its been a while. Well lets start it off with miranda and Jimmy broke up which I find amusing and everyone knew they wouldn't work but it is funny they she didn't believe it. Jimmy is going back out with amanda now. Which is good for him he seems happy and he has free time I see him alot now. Which went from not at all when he was with miranda because I didn't want to see him at all.

Went golfing on tuesday for the first time all year it was fun me and Jimmy went out he was stoned but he played alright I won. Kyle moves to toronto on the first so he has less then a week left here which sucks alot. I will miss good old KR.

Spurs won the NBA finals which means T owes me some money. But T won't sign up with the king of iron fist tournament. But Jeff said he would. I signed up. I need to work out alot more now and I have to get paul to train me. So that I can at least compete I got 2 months to train. Should be interesting to say the least. 

Hmm not much else interesting. I kind of want to party right now but its sunday and thats more of a monday thing to do lol. Well we will see what happens. well I am out for now.

"event","Well I wrote that e-mail and yet i am back here because I don't feel like that I got everything off my chest and some other things were told to me after when i wrote the last one of these as well. So I have some stuff to write in here.

So that bad feeling did come true as it always does and shuan wants chelsey back. Now I don't blame one bit if I was in his shoes I would do the same damn thing. I hope chelsey doesn't think I am mad at her I'm not. I'm not mad at all. I am just sad that I never got another shot you know what I mean. Like I can't help it if I still love her. But I am sure shaun feels the same way and he wants to be with her I can't compete with shaun I lost last time too. Chelsey wants to be with him and that okay. I do just want her to be happy rather then myself. If he can love her one tenth of how much I do then they should be good and happy lol. 

But I just think about everything right now I just hate being hurt inside it all just doesn't feel worth it at all. I do my best and it never seems good enough for someone that I want. There is always someone better. I never get to be the better in the someone better lol. Which assuming when I think about it. I just don't even write anymore. I just give up on this stuff. There are so many things I want to write but i just don't think they are right at all. I don't even know what to do. I feel like I am just wasting my time with so many things right now.

I had something I was gonna write .........wait now I remember maybe I should take the same way as jordan maybe he thought the right way and he can't be friends with chelsey it just hurts to much. Maybe he had the right idea. I didn't think it was the right idea before but maybe he was right. I dunno but I am out.

I'm nothing in these boots, and laceless velcro shoes. There used to be a reason why. We wrote the words from across the sky. You and I will never die without a fight my suburban muse.

Thats the end of the song portion of this. I am bored and I like that song. I don't know why I just think it is a good song. Maybe just the words between the lies. I don't know why but I just have that feeling right now that something bad has happened or something is about to and it's going to make me bitter. I get that feeling every so often and something bad usually does happen. So I guess I have to wait and see what it is this time. 

I always rather interesting how things can seem so good and then just like that it was like there was nothing there at all. Well I am just so bitter write now I just don't know what to write. I dunno just alot of feelings go throw my head. Maybe I will write an e-mail I haven't done that in a while. usually gets things out there. They get my mind off things because the topic I want to write about it goes into something else and I forgot for that time being. Well I am gonna go do that then and see what comes out I just need to think of a main topic.

It's so bad I just lost my groove I need to get it back because these losses aren't even close. He beat me by like 50000 last time. I felt ashamed lol. Well I the movie was good anyway. It was funny and thats what it is all about isn't it. went back to Kr's and played some games watched ""smallville"" which was great I might add. But it is always great. I went to sleep on the ground because I am a retard and there was a couch in the other room. My neck hurt so much the next day and my arm. Damn ground *shakes fist in the air*.

Didn't do much yesterday ""worked"" had one delivery all day which was more then fine. I got to sit around I was pretty damn bored. Fucking watched miami lose by 4 which made me so mad I almost had taylor for the 4th straight year now I have to watch the rest of the playoffs to see if he owes me money again. 

Had a dream about chelsey last night and woke up with a smile pretty nice. But thats a whole new story. i like dreams that you can remember and it was actually good. Well today i might go out with T or KR and play some basketball not sure what I am gonna do. Megan told me to come get her and go see her mom. Her mom is awesome and loves me. But I don't know if I want to drive all the way to barrie and get her lol. well I am out got things to do.

"event","I must say the last 2 days have been pretty good and I haven't even done anything that special well it made me happy so I guess it was special to me lol. Yesterday I was so mad and unhappy like all day I don't even know why well the miranda thing was just the tip of the iceberg but I think I woke up in sort of a bad mood you know you have those days. But then chelsey came online and she wanted to talk on the phone and how can you be in a bad mood when you talk to chelsey on the phone? Well the answer to that is simple you can't be unhappy all you can be is happy talking to her. So basically after I talk to her and got online I was in a pretty happy mood and then I went to bed in a good mood and for some reason I think I had a dream about her because I woke up smiling and thinking about her lol.

Today is pretty boring though I just basically sat around went shopping for my mom went to the beer store. Worked which isn't much work mind you but it gives me money for doing just about nothing so I am happy with that. But the highlight of the night was the unexpected call from chelsey. Our conversations are pretty random but I never find myself wanting to get off the phone and it sucked when I did. I wanted to stay on the phone but I had to go. After all this talking to her I kind of want to see her. I dunno everytime I see her I can't help but smile and I would never want that feeling to end. As you can see I am in a pretty happy mood right now. Megan even asked me how I was and I said great. Which I never say so I must be feeling good. I am gonna be so damn bored tomorrow I got nothing to do well I never make plans in advance they are always pretty random and out of no where. I like it that way add a little excitment to life if you don't know what your going to do. I am trying to convince my mom into getting paul to take the van tomorrow so I have something to drive so I can actually go places tomorrow. But we will see what happens. I am watching some weird ass movie right now with some kids doing coke and freaking out. It pretty weird. Well I am out for now

"event","Well it's been an interesting last few days. Yesterday my family came here well until today. It was my aunt and my cousin who is the same age as me, her child and my aunts 2 kids. From the age of 1-5 I lived with that cousin kathrine. I haven't seen her much in the past 5 years though. She just had the baby and I must say the highlight of my day today was playing with that baby for like an hour. It was so much fun and the baby seemed to be just having a blast we me playing stupid games with her. She is only 6 months old and pretty cute I must say. You know that game that people do to try to hustle money out of you on the street with the ball under the cups. I was doing that with her she is quite an eye I must say she was grabing the right cup lol. Well actually she was more like hitting every cup but I had a hell of alot of fun. Made me think about how much fun a baby of my own would be. Well I don't want one now but in the future if it is anything like today it would probably be more fun because it would be my own.

Well other then that last night I went to ty's with some people. Well I drove there and drove home alone which was kind of dull lol. No one to talk too. But Ty's was fun played some poker had some good times. Killed Miranda at crazy 8 count down 2 times. Man I am just the king at that game. I played adam on the weekend at that and beat him 3 times. Undefeated lol. We payed darrell 30 dollars to fight club Jimmy keith and he did and now d has bumps all over his face and a black eye. But it was worth the watch lol.

Hmmm thats all I got to say for now. oh yeah I send thalia my picture so she can make me a drawing of me. Oh it better be good lol. I want a big head and little body riding a bike lol that would be so great. But I have seen her drawings and she has quite the talent well she does going to college for that so she should be good at it lol. Well I am out

"event","Well it's been 2 months of nothing on here which is basically because I always forget I have these things and when I want to get stuff out I kind of just leave it in when I don't have something to express myself and isn't that what it is all about getting stuff out. Well not that much that is interesting is going on. I almost did drugs almost I was tempted I must say last night alot but I held composer and stayed strong I will not lose to kyle roberts he will break before me. I refuse to lose lol. I am glad I have this holding me back at least it is something I don't want to fall into something like that. Like some of my friends that can't go very long without it. But I guess they choose how they live there life as I do.

Well I would like to say me and Jimmy are on the road to recovery. He is a good kid i don't know if i could think of him in the same way after everything not that I think of him as a bad person or even now care that he is with miranda. I think miranda was just something to by time actually now that I think of it. Like she did get my mind off things and off Chelsey for a while. But everytime I talk to chelsey it just brings back everything and I can't help it nor do I really want to. I would much rather be with someone I care about alot then be with someone because they are there.

The only thing that does suck is I want to be with Chelsey and I have no idea how she feels about me. She makes me feel amazing everytime I am around her like no one else has. I would just hope that I could give her a little bit of what she gives me everytime we are together or everytime we talk. I really hope she knows how much I care for her and will no matter what happens between I will always just want to see her happy more then my own I guess that's what you have to do sometimes for the person you care about. You let them go and hope they come back someday.

Well hmm what else I was gonna say something but I just need to remember it. I had an interesting weekend full of fun. Over the past month I have lost one friend but I hope not to lose any more lol. So I am gonna keep it cool and let things play out the way they will. My parents get home tomorrow which is okay. They leave every weekend ish so I usually get the weekend to myself. Well I am out it's getting late and I do want to sleep at an okay time tonight I am gonna try to write in here more.

Well I haven't been online much the past few days I must say I haven't really wanted to be on. I haven't felt up to it I always get this feeling when I am on just a i don't know how to decibe it. A feeling how about that just that I should be waiting for something but I could be doing other things. 

I am not in high spirits right now I feel like something bad is about to happen or is happening right now or infront of me and I am not being told something to protect the way to would feel. I know there is something. Whenever I get this feeling it is always something. Well I guess I will just have to wait and see who the first person to tell me is. I am probably not gonna be happy because I never get good news its always bad. But the sooner I find out it is always the better and I will think about that when I feel down.

Well I am out I need to think alot about what is going on.

Well tonight I am hanging out with ""The band"" or the gang or just friends if you will gonna have some fun. I garentee it lol I can't spell today. Well I believe I have fought my cold the only way I know how. As Jimmy would say coke and chips will cure you everytime. I was gonna have a few beers with him last night when he was here. But needless to say I was not up to the task but maybe tongiht maybe next weekend. maybe wednesday. Hmmm wednesday is sylvia's birthday now she gets one big sellout. But i am a nice guy and hate being mean to people. Well I will decide if i will go or not on that day because right now I have no idea.

I am kind of disappointed I didn't go to the balons last night I would have seen chelsey but i wasn't sure and I really didn't feel like driving there if on bthe chance she wasn't there then i would have had to stay and you know things get nutty lol. I don't hold myself responible for what happens when I am drinking. It was the not me it was drunk me if you have a problem I am gonna have to ask you to take it up with him.

Not what I am looking for anymore I don't know how to explain it and I just kinda want to be with chelsey if you know what I mean haha.

Well had a good day played some basketball with taylor then after we did a little slam dunk competion. I did the old Jimmy windmill rage jam. Taylor did the old 360 throw down it was good. We did a bunch of other crazy ones. It tires you out so much. I felt like I was gonna throw up. But I plan to start working out again I need to get into shape like I am not fat but I am lazy i need something to do.

Me and tony I know tony had a nice chat it was good we talked about relationships he said he was sorry about chelsey and me spliting up which was nice of him then we talked about relationships between people and he was right that when you are 16-17 you really are looking for something else in a relationship when you are 18.

You might think that they are so close they would want the same thing but I even know when I was dating megan when i was 16 and she was 18. In the start I wanted to spend time with her all the time and in the end I was just like I would rather be with my friends. Maybe that is just how it is and you grow up alot in that stort bit of time. But it is something that will happen to us all. you will want something more in your life a real long term relationship. I guess you just have to find that special person. I am not saying in all cases this is true don't call me on that haha.

Well I am tired and I want to watch the goonies so I am gonna go cya later.

""Why would a wookie, an eight foot tall wookie, want to live on Endor with a bunch of two foot tall Ewoks?"" ahhh I love it. Goodtimes. Last night went out with the kids it was fun was up until 4:30 having some goodtimes. 

My stomache still hurts alot like I woke up and all yesterday it was alot of pain. It happens you play through the pain thats just how it work. I am bored today though not much to do you know its a weekend kind of boring probably just sit on my ass. Maybe play some madden thats always a good time. 

NBA playoffs start today gonna give me something to watch should be nice.

Now as for other things I think people need to calm down a bit. Like take a deep breath maybe go out for a little walk. Clear there head a little alright you feel better haha. What happens to me is my decision maybe you are not aware of this. I have the last choice just as I gave all of yours your own. What I decide will be the best for me. I am sick and tired to trying to please people and make them happy while just letting myself get hurt. As someone would say it is to late to change the past but it is a good time to change the future.

I believe that the end more then justifies the means if you understand what that means. That means any means nessesary to work through something. I don't need anyones pitty. People to pretend like you care when you know that isn't the case. Just be yourself and things will work out one way or another.

Ahhh well now I am awake at least I was a bit tired been that alot lately.

Well the last thing is people just need to face the facts that things don't go the way you want them to go and the way you deal with that is what makes you who you are. Your reaction to tiring times or to tragity makes up who you are and the way people see you at your worst. I know the way I deal with it. Now all of you need to figure that out for yourself. Goodbye

"event","Well a couple of days ago I was thinking about things in general with people between females and males in relationships and mind you some cases this isn't true. There are some women that go the other way and some men that go the other way as well.

Let me get to the point this has to do with jealousy and mind you there is always a boarder between things which I will explain after this thought. What I see or notice is that whenever a guy gets jealous of his girlfriend with other guys and says something about it the women seems to be compelled to be angry and think of it as a very bad thing. But in the case of women being jealous of there boyfriends hanging out with certain women. If they talk to there boyfriend about it the guy seems to be more understanding of it and it sort of makes him feel loved that he knows that she cares about him to be jealous.

Thats what I kind of don't understand how can the same thing mean to different things between 2 people. The women could feel like she is being controlled by his comments. But in the guys case he feels like it is a new step in the relationship that she is able to come out and say that sort of thing.

Now where the barrier of jealousy and controlling is broken is where you tell someone they can't hang out with someone and that is 2 far for both sides. You can never tell someone who they can and cannot talk or hang out with. That is controlling someone. For both male and female that is not a good thing.

Now I was gonna say something else just give me a second haha......oh yeah now as for the controlling part I really don't think you should ever have to go to the degree of telling your boyfriend or girlfriend they can't to talk to someone. If you have told them how you feel they should in one way or another be able to take care of the problem not in the sence of just stop being friends with the person but being able to re-assure you that you have nothing to worry about. The only extreme to that is if they know something has happened between you and them. If you cheated on them and they know and they still took you back I am sorry but they have the right to tell you not to talk to that person. You cheated on him or her. You have to earn that trust back.

For my closing comments. If you are dating someone you know in the back of your mind no matter what there is at least a little jealousy for someone out there. No matter how many times you tell yourself you know you are thinking something it is just the way people are and how they will always be. I believe that it is truly a new in any relationship when you can finally get those kinds of feelings out.

Even if i am angry right now in the end I don't want it to cloud my better judgement. So I hold back and don't put how I really feel or my real thoughts. As I said you can put as many nice things as you want in here. But bad things you have to pick and choose thats how it works. Unless you are the only one reading it thats how it works. 

The only things saying how I really feel is that emotion at the bottem and that doesn't tell you much. Well on a lighter note I have been accepted to now 4 out of the 5 colleges. I will probably just go to georgian it is close and I don't have to go far to see people. Thats about all that is new. 

well I am out cya later keep it real and don't do anything I wouldn't do.

I guess everyone has there problems.

Well other then that should be a good time with the kids tomorrow. Play some games you know all the fun stuff I haven't seen tucci in a while either so its good to see the guy he is a lovable character to say the least.

"event","Well I did something thinking today and tongiht and I realized something. Love is quite the thing. Nothing like it out there. Such a great feeling. Everything doesn't seem to matter when you have it.

I thought about it for a while and it just makes things different. Even the slightest thing that wouldn't matter with other people is so much better with that special person. 

I guess thats what this is all about to find that special person that makes everything for you great. Just seeing him or her makes you smile and you never want it to end. A silence feels special and the look in there eyes make you loose yourself and wonder what is going on but you can't look away. I know this might all sound weird or like this could never happen to anyone like this. But to those people that don't know what I am talking about you haven't experenced the greatness that is love and once you have it you will know and you will never want to let it go. 

Well thats about all I have to say. Just thought I would write something nice after all the bad stuff haha cya

So yes I do feel a little aggravated right now. I don't know why I just woke up bitter. Everyday the angry is just building inside of me. can't seem to stop it. Today just seems to be one of those days. 

As Joe would say. ""It's good to see the rage and evil intentions back"" A little part of me enjoys it all back. But I thought it was all gone. Well this looks like one of those unexpected changes. But still an exceptable sitation I guess. I just need to burn it off. In the past I had ways to get it all out there. But right now its a different story. So me and joe worked out a plan. He won't know what hit him haha. 

Well other then that I can't get to sleep again because of this all I do is lie in bed and think. I thought that was gone but it comes back in situations such as these. But hey what its all good. I enjoy it most of the time. Give me a good time to think about things that i should do. Way the possiblities like a used too. Life is all about statistics you just have to figure out what one is the best choice. 

It seems like I have wrote enough for now. When I think of something else maybe I will write it in.

"event","wow got the worst advice tonight I have ever gotten ever from anyone. Which was Megan's and I quote ""Just break up with her"" What the hell is that.haha what is that solving. I don't want to break up with her. I love her do I look nuts. then she says ""If she comes back you 2 were meant to be"" and what if she doesn't then what do I do. i am not taking that chance. She hasn't even done anything wrong like common. Lets keep it on the table here people. Now if she did something then maybe you can say that. Not if she hasn't. Kids these days. Like I thank you for the ""attepted advice"". But advice should at least help out not make me more worried with the other stuff she says.

But on the lighter side sam thank you for your advice and help it means alot that you were there I didn't think you had it in you but you did and you calmed me down thank you so much you are a good friend. You moved up on the charts because of this.

Well I am out to play some loathing haha cya later

But this bull shit happens and just makes me mad all over again. Like common now. ahh I just need to talk to joe about this shit he will have some good advice so maybe I can get a grip on things because I am just gonna snap at some point. Actually this is sort of helping. I am enjoying it. This song helps too. Its good or anto let where is the asian invasion when you need the guy haha.

I will be fine in a bit. But at the momment it just seems to be getting worse and worse until I just snap AHHH. Well its all good I will get over it all and just let it be I always do I am such a push over in some cases. Well I am done this it helped a little but not enough.

Our paths they did cross now I can not say just why. We met we laughed we held on fast and then we said goodbye and who'll hear the echo's of stories never told let them in and glide until they unfold.

In my dearest memories, I see you reaching out to me. Though your gone I still belive that you can call out my name.

A voice from the past joining yours and mine, adding up the layers of harmony and so it goes on and on. Melodies of life to the sky behond the flying bird forever and behond.

So far and away see the bird as it flyies by. Gliding through the shadows of the cloud up in the sky. I've laid my memories and dreams upon those wings let them go and see what tomorrow brings. 

In my dearest memories, do you remember loving me? was it fate that brought us close and now leave me behind.

A voice from the past joining yours and mine, adding up the layers of harmony and so it goes on and on. Melodies of life to the sky behond the flying bird forever and behond.

If I should leave this lonely world behind. Your voice will still remember our melody. Now I know we'll carry on. Melodies of life come circle and grow deep in our hearts. For as long as we remember."

Well kids had a great day. Won some money, saw chelsey watch a movie. Well lets just say it was great. 

You know what is weird whenever chelsey is around I feel like such a little kid. Hmmm an example its like when you are little and you see someone and want to spend all of your time with that person because they make you happy and you show them everything. Like that its weird and I can't help it but i like the feeling that i get. Makes me really happy and loved.

I am not gonna lie to you kids I think I might have just had the best kiss of my life tonight. It was just like everything went away so nice. Nothing i could ever explain you just have to feel it. 

well kids its been fun I know I have had alot of fun. Joe and sam have fun tonight.......SINNERS. Anto have a nice trip home tomorrow if I don't get to talk to you and I love you chelsey bye bye

Had a nice chat with sam on the ride home about things. It was alright. I feel better in ways because I know things about in other ways a little worse.

I realized fully that I have nothing to worry about chelsey cheating on me. Well I knew that a while ago but never said anything. I am sure inside my heart that she would never do that to me. 

This past few days with anto I learned alot. Alot about trust and i have thought about it alot. Without trust you really have nothing. You have to trust in what you believe in. I trust chelsey, I trust my friends, with that i can't have anything bad happen to me. I realized that tonight its a great thing and I am happy about everything in my life. I have a great girlfriend and great friends. I might not say it enough but I really do love you guys thank you for always being there.

Eventually the people find out and its ten times worse then it would ahve been. Thats just how it works. thats my lesson for today. I hate liars. So if you lie I hate you.

"event","Well today was great well it started off shitty but it just got better and better. 

Woke up at little bitter seeing that the music was loud and woke me up. Yeah that was cool. Then my parents leave and tell me that kevin is watching tv don't bug him. Made me a little bitter.

But then chelsey phoned made things better just hearing her voice. Then joe phoned asked if I wanted to come over. I couldn't because chelsey was coming over and I wanted to see her. So he called back at 4 and he came over with the kids. we had some fun. 

But the best part was just seeing chelsey and her smile. So nice. We watched boondock saints as good as I remembered it. mind you I didn't watch some of the movie I would just go off sometimes and looks at her. I had seen the movie before anyway. its not like I see her everyday, which would be cool. 

well then she left made me a little sad because I miss her already but I knew she had to go home so its okay there will always be next time.

She got me this cute turtle things. Its going right beside my bed on the night stand. with the ninja turtle. They are like brother but in the black sence not in the actually brothers if you knwo what I mean. His name is carlos he is the man haha.

well and now I need some sleep tomorrow is gay sunday gotta hate sunday.

Had chelsey over it was so great. Watched 2 movies one good, one poor taste. Overworld not even a renter you want to see it go watch matrix its better. In this situation it was worth every second though.

Quite the day i must say went to barrie with tucci, kyle, and Jimmy. I didn't by anything though so kind of a big waste to go. Might by something on saturday though. But maybe for chelsey not me. I don't need anything. Kind of bored right now. Nothing really to do. Other then sit on my ass. People driving now the street I see them but they don't see me.

Wow there is no good radio stations remember that people none. I just checked got nothing but crap.

And when I came to I was on the school bus... completely nude of course... I remember one Christmas he stripped me naked and locked me out of the house jsut when the Carolers were arriving... Talk about a Merry Christmas...   Good times

I remember one time... my father came home from a night on the town which of course had turned into a week... and my Mother said, ""John, is there anything you wont drink?""... and my father shot back, ""Poison... I'm saving it for you."" (Laughing) And I and my brother who is now an alcoholic himself... just about died laughing

ahh goodtimes good times. So I had a good day talked everything out with chelsey so it seems and she doesn't seem to hate me so that a plus. We started talking about alot of stuff made me happy she seems to do that to me so thats a good thing. She is a little to hard on herself though no everything is her fault. Just feel better. I want you to be happy thats all I want. well other then that i get cable internet tomorrow should eb nice and a bug in a rug haha.

~No time to register the shame I feel as I try not to notice you and its a sad state of affairs to ignore this wrongness everywhere~

That is kind of how I feel if you understand that. Well on the bright side I did have a nice chat with joe about some stuff that was important and now I have more to talk to him about. These heart things are tasty though. I am just eatting them up haha. well now its been 24 minutes going for the record here people.

She won't tell me something that is bothering her and I am aware it is none of my business but I tell her almost everything and I expect the same back. I am sorry if I sound like an ass but thats how I am sometimes....okay most of the time.

Chelsey is good always keeping her stick on the ice if you will. Had a good talk on the phone with her she is always fun to talk to on the phone. She likes to yell though at her brother haha I am kidding her yelling is just someone talking normal it is cute.

Joe comes back this weekend hopeful I will see the guy its been a while. Got some catching up to do. 

Well my iced cream is getting melted so i must eat it.

"event","Well its been a while. I would be on msn right now but you know how cool it is haha so I am still tight and waiting for it to be awesome and let me in. Which might take a while but a while is something I got or I will go play a little SF to pass the time when my mom goes to bed. 

I had such a headache all day that seemed to get qorse as the day went on. So gay I must say. I get so bored now with nothing to do. I miss school it at least gave me something to pass the time so that i wasn't just sitting on my ass all the time. 

As my final note. This last week will be the hardest make or break here. This is where you seperate the men from the boys. 6 days left.

"event","Awww I had a super awesome day well it could have been better not to much better to say the least. Went to Adam's played a little WH it was good me and James won. Victory for the Empire. The came home and talked to chelsey for a long time.

Thing that could have been better I must say is the new england win like I know they deserved the win but I hate them so much. New England was the best team in the league so they should get it. 

What made me really happy was the fact that chelsey said that we would be together for her birthday. Like I know I feel sometimes that things might not work out because of things. But when she said that it was like everything just went away it was really nice. 

well I begin work tomorrow I have to wake up early so I need to sleep so goodnight and god speed spiderman haha"

"event","You know what this was my last day of exams and I am done school now everything is done I have nothing to worry about at all everything seems to be going great. But I don't know why but I just have this feeling something bad is about to happen something is going to change this all. Sooner then later. i don't make the rules here whenever I get this feeling it does happen. 

Now you people might say well Jimmy what do you have to worry about things are going your way. But things can change very fast I must say that one second you can be ontop of the world and the next your back at the bottom. I have had this feeling all day. Maybe it is just my mind playing tricks on me. Something it does that but I am gonna keep that eye out though."

Business tomorrow make or break here on this one either i do well and pass or I do bad and fail the class. I haven't even studied.

"event","Hey look at this I made one of these crazy sites. Actually I am just really bored so I was like hey why not make one might be fun. So here I am writing up a storm. Maybe this will be a way to get things out there for the kids.

Well today I must say was one to remember in my books a day of thinking and a day of conclusions. I think I made the right choice there is no doubt in my mind that I did the right thing.

Love is a powerful thing and you don't want anything to get in the way of that. Everything seems better when you are in love. I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. She is a great women that makes me happy everytime I talk to her or even think about her.

She has only been gone for a few minutes and i already miss her. Well this is getting long haha. 

Exam monday business if I fail the exam I fail the course. so good luck to me haha"

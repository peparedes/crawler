i havnt posted i a while and sometimes when i am reading other peoples ljs i stop and wonder why 
i wonder if i am not leaving myself enough time to well myself 
things a very interesting latley
i moved again
thats nothing unusual 
i find myself in a place that i have never been before
i wonder if it will last or if this is just my imagination playing tricks with my heart just to try and get at me one more time
i have discovered some things that i like and some things that i never want to try again
green apple cinnamon watermelon raspberry 
there are things that i wonder things that i contemplate 
i wonder if i wrote an admissions essay like this one time weather or not i would be accepted
people tell me that im great and that any where that i dont get in must be a terrible place and i would not have wanted to go there anyways just because i did not get in
but it is strange knowing that i ahve already surpassed my family 
dreams
what are they and where can they truely take us
i have dreams 
yet many tell me that to have these dreams is a false sense of hope because i can never accomplish them because of the way that i am and the very fact that i am unwilling to sell my sould just to gain them in the first place
a week has gone by 
no movie yet
no snow in the horizon of the weeks yet to come
good old newport with its sunny weather that doesnt change year round
ive been here for a long time 
wanting to get out 
getting out and then getting pulled right back in
i dont like the color white 
reminds me to much of an institution
guy got one point hugher on a test than me and then proceded to do a happy dance around the classroom
when asked what the reason for the dance was 
he said simply i beat her
someone finally did it and it was me
i wonder why this sparked so much joy into this person
i do not wish to seem snooty 
unlike my father has told me countless times
i do not wish to sound like i am full of myself either 
sometimes i wonder 
where am i going 
what battles will i face
will i triumph
or ill i die in its place"

do i really know
do i have anychoice as to what the outcome is
sometimes i wonder
sometimes i wonder if everything that is happening is happening for a reason and theni stop becasue i know that it is
but what is this reason 
what is the driving force behind all that exsits
what makes people search for love
what drives people to better themselves
what is it that makes people yearn for soemthing that they dont have
is there something out there that i am just not seeing
why have i met you 
what good will come of it
how will we change each others lives
is there some other purpose behind that is not seen
will we have any effect on each other
or is it just another step in the journey of life
do we even matter
is there any point in even considering the we 
or will you just leave me like everyone else
will you go back to her if she called
is there any true chance for us
would you turn from me if given the chance
should i give you everything or nothing
do you even want that much from me
how will i ever know if i dont ask you
but im afraid to ask
what will you think of me
will you think me weak 
are you weak
do you need me like i need soemone
is there any point or purpose for us to be together
i want to be with you but do you want to be with me
will anything have to be given up for us to be together
will you change when your around me
will you be the same around our friends
what will be"

i will be leaving soon
my uncle died the day after my grandma had a stroke
i only spent one day with a really amazing guy at camp
the guy that i love lives on the other side of the country
my phone was stolen two days before the end of school so i dont have alot of phone numbers now
i havenot been able to hang out with alot of my friends

i need another girls night

i think that it is interesting that i finally found a guy that i really like and can actually see myself with for a long time and it turns out that he lives in New Jersey.

yet i think that it is sort of better becasue this might help me break the habit of dating so many guys

i made it up to eight guys this last school year by the way if anyone wanted to know

anyways i think that it will help to tell if jacob and i are going to last becasue he is on the other side of the country but i will be going over there for christmas 

this school year schould be interesting. im killing myself with classes

I think that guys dont make sense to me alot and yet I like hanging out with them mroe then I like hanging out with girls. I dont know where i am going in the world of guys and ys it is a world of its own. 
There are some guys that I like but I think that if I try and go after them then eventually they might just go away instead of come closer, which would curse the whole plan in general. 
So what to do? That is the question at hand.
Oh ya and i got a date to prom, im going with Pascal Julietts little brother.

"event","ok so i jsut looked at my recent entry you know just sort of glancing at it and i looked at the little girl that i have whenever i put on an emotion and it is sort of funny becaseu it reminds me of the times when i have been so happy that i seem like that little girl there arnt many of those times but i think i had one the day after christmas 

growing up i never lived with my father he was always sort of there i would get a nice card from him from whatever prison he was in this time or i would get a phone call and sometimes i would see him but he would never tell me that he was going to come and then jsut never show up becaseu he had to go and meet in transit my grandma moved me to wyoming so that my mother would not be able to tell me that she was going to see me and then never show up my family is sort of strange like that so anyways that moment of actual happiness where i almost cried when i realized that it had happened it was the day after christmas and i needed to get some things for people you know last minute christmas shopping after christmas and dad was taking me he took me last year to and he goes and he wakes me up at like seven in the morning and he tells me that we have to go in order to beat the crowds and so we go to target and we are there before eight oclock and i mean i was barley awake but the thing that really made me happy was the fact that i had done something with him two years in a row and it was not going to visit him in jail or something like that this was a good thing i mean he is clean he is doing so many things that completly contradictied his former character that he has grown to be the man that he could be he started doing drugs when he was my brothers age and that is like nineteen so when the body starts to fuck itself up at that early of an age it stops growin git stops maturing it sort of stays in a stagnat position until it has room to grow again my mother started either at my age or before that and she grew up in a sheltered home in and out of insane aslyms so her mental capacity for right and wrong is comtlely childlike 

i lived with my mother until i was four at which time i was taken away when she went to jail and then i lived with my grandma until fourth grade my mother was clean and she began to grow she was dating a great guy that gave her everything that she wanted in the world then my father got out of jail and i always had this little fantasy that they would get back together event hough they did nto live together and before that i did not live with them then they finished their divorce that was seven years in the making and my current step father got out of jail upon gettin gout of jail my mother promised me that the first time he did something bad that he would be gone and during the time that we lived with him he went back to jail several times and yet even after that they still went to vegas and got married but oh she had her heroine so everything was ok then we moved out to lake elsinore and great drug capitol my brother did nto move with us but i had the strange concept in my head that i could change her that i could make everything right again so i moved with her knowing full well what she was doing i ran away several times i lived at other peoples houses i was gone for weeks at a time and she did nto even realize that i was gone i went to vegas with a friend and i came back and i went to my house and she said oh your home from school already and i told her that i had just gotten back from vegas and she said oh and went back to sleep and then i got sick i had mono and strep throat at the same time she didnt really do anything about it i was out of school for over two months it was my father who finally came up to lake elsinore and took me to the emergency room becasue i could not eat and i could not sleep very well the doctors told him that if they had waited any longer i would have been dead by now so then i got better and i tried to go back to school but it wasnt the same i had hated it before but i hated it more then so then i came back to costa mesa i practially slept for two weeks recouperating from the sickness soi moved back in with grandma and i started going to school again i loved it all over again i was with the people that i had come to love in elementary school my mother ended up loosing her house my step father went back to jail as well as my father then my dad got out and went to a half way house my father has been clean for almost three years and my mother is getting smaller becasue of the drug i dont know where she is and most of the time i dont want to know my daughter lauren her mother died she says that is is hard but then i told her that it is harder to have you mother alive and not know where she is then to have her dead becaseu then at least you dont have to always wonder weather or not she is still alive and chooses not to live 

everyone has the ability to change weather or not they persue that is what makes and devolps their character it develops the very essence of who they are my father is a man that is constantly trying to change and is trying to do the best for himself while my mother tells me one thing and then does another just like when i was little and we lived in a car and she used to tell me that we were going to go and stay at a friends house and that everything was going to be ok and then the next thing i knew she would be passed out and there was the little three year old left to take care of herself 

this post started becasue of change it did nto start or continue so that people would feel sorry for me i dont want that actually i would hate that i just want to be somewhat understood and the only way that a person can be understood is if you know about them so through this post if you have read i hope that you will understand somewhat of the actions that i take towards things in a way i am glad that i have gone trhough the things that i have becaseu it has made me the person that i am today and it has given me the drive to try and help the poeple that are in my same position my grandma always says oh no shes not going to do something like that she had enough of that in her childhood and yet grandma does not know half of what i had 

well i think that the time has come to stop the dwelling on the past and to pay attention to the present to live for today besides i may be sad about the past but i am excited about the future tomorrow is a new year and already the outcome looks bright i am happy with the things that are going on happy new year and laters.."

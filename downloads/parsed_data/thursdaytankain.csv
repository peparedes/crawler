"event","THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER
the sun was shining ont the sea 
shining with all his might
and this was odd because it was 
the middle of the night
the walrus and the carpenter
were walking close at hand
they wept like anything to see 
such quantites of sand
"" if this were only cleared away 
they said it would be grand""
""if seven maids with seven mops
swept it for half a year
do you suppose the walrus said 
that they could get it clear?""
"" i doubt it"" said the carpenter
and shed a bitter tear.
""o oysters come and walk with us!""
the walrus did beseech.
a pleasant walk a pleasant talk
along the briny beach 
we cannot do with more than four 
to give a hand to each""
four young oysters hurried up
all eagar for the treat
there coats were brushed, their faces washed
their shoes were clean and neat
and this was odd because you know
they hadnt any feet
four more oysters followed them 
and yet another four 
and thick and fast they came at last
and more and more and more
all hoping through the frothy waves
and scrambling to the shore
the walrus and the carpenter
walked a mile or so
then rested on a rock 
conveniently low
and all the oysters stood 
and waited in a row
""the time has come the walrus said 
to talk of other many things
of shoes and ships and sealing wax
of cabbages and kings
and why the sea is boiling hot
and wheather pigs have wings""
""but wait a bit the oysters said
befor our chat
for some of us ae out of breath 
and all of us are fat!""
""no hurry!"" said the carpenter 
and they thanked him much for that
""a loaf of bread the walrus said
is what we chiefly need""
pepper and vinegar besides
are very good indeed
now if your ready oysters dear
we may begin to feed
"" but not on us the oysters cried
turning a little blue
after such kindness that would be 
a dismaissal thing to do!""
"" the night is fine the walrus said
do you admire the view?
it was so kind of you to come
and you are very nice!""
"" it seems a shame the walrus said 
i deeply sympathize""
with sobs and tears he sorted out
these of the largest size
holding his pocket handkerchief
before his streaming eyes
"" o oysters said the carpenter
you've had a pleasant run
shall we be trotting home again?""
but answer there came none 
and this was scarely odd because
they had eaten every one."

"event","greetings yesterday at around one my mom decided to take my 2nd uncle and his woman to disneyland. but she said that i should tag along to like take pictures and make sure they dont get lost and fall in quicksand and  my mom has the i.q of a plant so i had to go and danny came too. it was hot and gay...mostly hot. i thought it was a little to crowded for a wednesday. anyways me and danny went on the haunted mansion the indiana jones ride (that shit was an hour wait!) there was a lot of people using that ""fast pass"" crap so they got on a hell of a lot quicker while the regular people stayed in line and watched. finally after that we decided to try that ""fast pass"" idea and we got one for thunder mountain. we went on mr. toads wild ride (to be honest its wasnt that wild..it should be renamed mr. toads mild ride) then we went back to thunder mountain. we showed our fast pass and walked past all those poor saps that had no fast pass. we waited a grand total of three minutes before we broaded the ride. that ""fast pass"" does just as it says. it passes the others really fast =) we then had to stop for some food. a got fries and he got a churro. total $5.50.how do those fuckers sleep at night. we got on gadgets go coaster and we thought roger rabbits car spin would be really good so we got in line. then that ""fast pass"" shit comes back and bites us right in the ass. it was as if everyone had one for that ride except us. while we waited this family of mexican tourist were in front of us. and to our left there was a fountain you know those fountains that you make wish and throw a penny in?
well that mexican family had this like nine year old kid who gets the bright idea 
of taking the pennies from the fountain. he starts doing this and soon his little sister his other little brother and yes even the grandma take part in the activity.they probably manage to take a good five dollars from that fountain.
me and danny start joking how all the white people threw money in there and in a matter of seven minutes the mexicans filled there pockets with it. we finally get on the ride. that shit wasnt worth the wait!! you get in a car and it spins you have to be on acid to enjoy that ride. we saw that parade and i saw ariel!!! well some chick dressed up like her..she was extremely pretty and so was the one dressed as belle. after that we met up with my mom and the other two and went on pirates of the caribean twice. and we convinced them to get on indiana jones before left. and that was it. i bought dasiy something and i tried to take this ariel pin but i just couldnt do it in front of my little brother...got to set a good example u know.that was it i wanted to get on the alice in wonderland ride but i guess that will have to wait till next time....in 2030 =P well i must retire now.bye bye"

"event","hello the spiderman movie is already out and guess who saw it?.....youll never get it..ok it was ME! yup on wednesday me and val and to a lesser extent ivan went to see the seven o clock show. we sat in the last row i had to sit next to this couple and in front of us were three gangsta chicks. all throughout the movie ivan talked. ""your losing your powers spiderman"" or ""i cant believe no one knows its him"" to make things worse he bought this icee and slurped on it till it made that noise you know that noise that tells you theres no more icee in the straw. half way through the movie one of the gangsta chicks gets fed up. she stands up and tells ivan "" can you shut the fuck up??!"" and ivan stares at her and says he can but he doesnt feel like it. shut the bitch up. then another one gets up and says shes gonna go find this lady one who works there so maybe she can kick us out. personally i think a slap on the wrist would have been sufficient. so she leaves and i decide that if she comes back with the lady and the lady wants us to leave id pretend i came alone. to convince her i would agree that ivan was being loud hey i wanted to see all of the movie and i wasnt gonna get thrown out because of his dumb ass. well the chick never found the lady and she had to sit back down. ivan continued to talk and this time louder just to piss them off even more. that was the first and last time i see a movie with him. yeah well anyways i finally talked to rodas!! =) yesterday he was online i thought the poor guy fell off the face of the earth or was eaten by a bear! but hes okay we spent some time remembering first period p.e :,) good times
then he had to leave because he claimed he had a Hot Date but i think he was just gonna get a pix of that chick and jack off....at that rate he'll never finish reading his toaster manual. oh well. as for wisconsinthug...nobodys killed him yet.
talked to him too...hmmm maybe i should give daisy a call havent talk to her in a while. well farewell i must take my leave so bye!
no more countdowns......i guess theres no point in having a live journal anymore"

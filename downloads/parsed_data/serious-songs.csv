A year or so back I was in the Russ Feingold camp, but he's announced he won't run.  I heart Obama as much as the next guy but I think he'll get shellacked on his lack of experience, especially if his opponent is John McCain.  Don't know much about Joe Biden, and that's gonna be a liability for him in a field full of so many high-profile candidates with whom voters are already very familiar.  And I -- like a lot of liberal Democrats -- was off the Hillary train long ago, though I'd of course vote for her if it came down to it.

So I say let's take a closer look at Edwards.

I know he came off as smarmy and processed in the '04 elections.  He could've swung a lot -- a LOT -- harder in his face-off with Dick Cheney in their sole debate.  But I still think the guy is the real deal.  His stump speech is really stirring -- focusing on eradicating poverty, ending global warming and pulling out of Iraq -- and I just find him generally likable.  I also think he'd have a shot in a showdown with almost any candidate the Republicans could field.

If you're so inclined, do check out <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZar5aNDDsI""><u>this speech</u></a> from a Ned Lamont rally last summer.  Skip the opening speeches and go straight to Edwards -- he starts talking about 11 and a half minutes in."

"event","Judd Gregg, Chairman of the congressional Budget Committe, wrote a letter to the NYTimes today.  In it he attempts to rebut a recent Times opinion column which took the GOP to task for its failure of a fiscal policy.  

Among Gregg's arguments:

""The issue of the deficit is primarily one of spending in entitlement accounts and of course paying the cost of the war and Katrina. You should focus on the looming crisis that will be brought on by the retirement of the baby boom generation.""

Here we have a shining example of the workings of the Republican mind.  Gregg correctly identifies some of the main causes of the deficit: ""entitlements,"" the War and Katrina (conveniently ignoring the massive Bush tax cuts for the rich, but that's another post).  But which of these should we pay attention to?  Certainly not the GOP's wasteful war of choice in Iraq, based on the supposed existence of WMD that didn't turn out to exist.  Certainly not the billions we must now plough into Katrina repairs, many of which expenditures might have been unnecessary if the GOP Bush Administration hadn't eviscerated FEMA and diverted funding away from necessary national security projects like fortifying New Orleans' levees.

No, we should focus on the liberals, and that damned Social Security of theirs that has led us to the brink of financial disaster!  Never mind that if we took the hundreds of billions we've been pouring into Iraq war and stuffed it into Social Security we could keep the program solvent for many years.  No, it is <i>unthinkable</i> that we could ever stem funding for the war.  The war is a matter ""of course.""

It's amazing to me that Republicans still think this shit holds water -- and that the party keeps hammering on Social Security ""reform"" in an election year.  Look at the polls, dude.  We like our social security.  We don't like the endless life-shredding budget-draining war.  But hey, dude, by all means, keep talking."

"event","As reported 32 minutes ago by the NyTimes... according to TIME magazine, <lj-cut text=""Tom DeLay Says He Will Give Up His Seat""><b>Tom DeLay Says He Will Give Up His Seat</b>
    By Mike Allen
    TIME Magazine

    Monday 03 April 2006

    <i>The embattled former Republican leader tells TIME that he will leave Congress and not seek reelection.</i>

    Rep. Tom DeLay, whose iron hold on the House Republicans melted as a lobbying corruption scandal engulfed the Capitol, told TIME that he will not seek reelection and will leave Congress within months. Taking defiant swipes at ""the left"" and the press, he said he feels ""liberated"" and vowed to pursue an aggressive speaking and organizing campaign aimed at promoting foster care, Republican candidates and a closer connection between religion and government.

    ""I'm going to announce tomorrow that I'm not running for reelection and that I'm going to leave Congress,"" DeLay, who turns 59 on Saturday, said during a 90-minute interview on Monday. ""I'm very much at peace with it."" He notified President Bush in the afternoon. DeLay and his wife, Christine, said they had been prepared to fight, but that he decided last Wednesday, after months of prayer and contemplation, to spare his suburban Houston district the mudfest to come. ""This had become a referendum on me,"" he said. ""So it's better for me to step aside and let it be a referendum on ideas, Republican values and what's important for this district.""

    DeLay's fall has been stunningly swift, one of the most brutal and decisive in American history. He had to give up his title of Majority Leader, the No. 2 spot in the House Republican leadership, in September when a Texas grand jury indicted him on charges of trying to evade the state's election law. So he moved out of his palatial suite in the Capitol, where he once brandished a ""No Whining"" mug during feisty weekly sessions with reporters, and moved across the street to the Cannon House Office Building, home of many freshmen.

    The surprise decision was based on the sort of ruthless calculation that had once given him unchallenged dominance of House Republicans and their wealthy friends in Washington's lobbying community: he realized he might lose in this November's election. DeLay got a scare in a Republican primary last month, and a recent poll taken by his campaign gave him a roughly 50-50 shot of winning, in an election season when Republicans need every seat they can hang onto to avoid a Democratic takeover of the House.

    ""I'm a realist. I've been around awhile. I can evaluate political situations,"" DeLay told TIME at his kitchen table in Sugar Land, a former sugar plantation in suburban Houston. Bluebonnets are blooming along the highways. ""I feel that I could have won the race. I just felt like I didn't want to risk the seat and that I can do more on the outside of the House than I can on the inside right now. I want to continue to fight for the conservative cause. I want to continue to work for a Republican majority.""

    Asked if he had done anything illegal or immoral in public office, DeLay replied curtly, ""No."" Asked if he'd done anything immoral, he said with a laugh, ""We're all sinners."" Asked what he would do differently, he said, ""Nothing."" He denied having failed to adequately supervise members of his staff, even though two of his former aides have pleaded guilty to committing crimes while on his staff. ""Two people violated my trust over 21 years,"" he said. ""I guarantee you if other offices were under the scrutiny I've been under in the last 10 years, with the Democrat Party announcing that they're going to destroy me, destroy my reputation, and that's how they're going to get rid of me, I guarantee you you're going to find, out of hundreds of people, somebody that's probably done something wrong.""

    DeLay brushed off the torrent of investigative news articles questioning the funding behind the golf, private planes and resort hotels that marked his travel at home and abroad. He even accepted a plane from R.J. Reynolds Tobacco to go to his arraignment. ""There's nothing wrong with it,"" he said. ""They had a plane available. My schedule was such that I couldn't do it commercially - that I had to get up there and then get back and do my job. And that's the only plane that was available at the time.""

    ""You can't prove to me one thing that I have done for my own personal gain,"" he added. ""Yes, I play golf. I'm very proud of the fact that I play golf. It's the only thing that I do for myself. And when you go to a country and you're there for seven days and you take an afternoon off to play golf, what does the national media write? All about the golf, not about the meeting that went to. I'm not ashamed of anything I've done. I've never done anything in my political career for my own personal gain. You can look at my bank account and my house to understand that.""

    ""I don't care what history writes, "" he continued. ""What I care about, what's important to me is who I am, what I've done and what I can accomplish in the future. What I care about it what I believe in and how I conduct myself in fighting for what I believe in.""

    Appearing relaxed despite three cups of coffee, DeLay played with his petite dogs and led a leisurely tour of his home. Upstairs, he offered a frame-by-frame description of the photos reflecting his past political clout, such as a private session on the Truman Balcony with the President and First Lady Laura Bush. The first frame marks the beginning of his arc from pest-control entrepreneur to a feared and ingenious power broker. It's the front page from a local paper, the Herald-Coaster, from 1978, proclaiming, ""DeLay Is House Winner."" That was the Texas House; voters sent him to Washington six years later, starting him on a 21-year congressional career. During the tour, he gave an indication of his early deftness at the political game when he showed off a picture of his wife, Christine, and their daughter, Danielle, with President Ronald Reagan. ""I had to withhold my vote,"" he said, ""to get my daughter's picture with Ronald Reagan as a freshman."" His wife, a formidable daily force in his office with a voice in nearly all scheduling and media decisions, pointed to a photo of former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, and noted, ""That's when we thought she was going to be conservative.""

    Putting the best face on the poll taken by his campaign, DeLay said it gave him ""a little bit better than a 50/50 chance of winning reelection."" Asked if that didn't mean that he could lose, he replied, ""Could have. There's no reason to risk a seat. This is a very strong Republican district. It's obvious to me that anybody but me running here will overwhelmingly win the seat.""

    DeLay said he is likely to leave by the end of May, depending on the Congressional schedule and finishing his work on a couple of issues. He said he will change his legal residence to his condominium in Alexandria, Va., from his modest two-story home on a golf course here in the 22nd District of Texas. ""I become ineligible to run for election if I'm not a resident of the state of Texas,"" he said, turning election law to his purposes for perhaps on last time. State Republican officials will then be able to name another Republican candidate to face Democrat Nick Lampson, a former House members who lost his seat in a redistricting engineered by DeLay.

    Lampson has made a major issue of the lobbying scandal, and his campaign home page has a petition headed, ""Tell Tom DeLay to Return the Dirty Money!,"" referring to contributions from he and his political action committees have received from disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, a one-time DeLay ally who pleaded guilty in January to three felonies, including conspiring to defraud clients and bribe public officials.

    DeLay's decision means that he no longer has to fear any further sanctions from the House ethics committee, which admonished him three times in 1994 for official conduct deemed inappropriate by members, but has been paralyzed for more than a year and has taken no action in the more recent scandal. Sources close to DeLay said he remains under investigation by the Justice Department prosecutors, who now have Abramoff's cooperation, but the lawmaker said he has nothing to fear from the feds. ""I paid lawyers to investigate me as if they were prosecuting me,"" he said. ""They found nothing. There is absolutely nothing - no connection with Jack Abramoff that is illegal, dishonest, unethical or against the House rules.""

    Richard Cullen, a former U.S. attorney who is DeLay's Washington lawyer, told TIME that in December, the lawmaker's legal team turned over to the Justice Department about 1,000 e-mails from his office computers. ""This was to show we had nothing to hide,"" Cullen said. ""They were everything we felt related to the Abramoff investigation. None are from DeLay. They're from staffers, showing their give and take with Abramoff. There was nothing that I said to myself or DeLay, wow, this is really bad for him. Prosecutors are looking to see whether anyone on the government payroll, whether a congressman or a staffer, performed official acts in return for a bribe or gratuity.""

    A Texas district attorney, Ronnie Earle of Travis County, indicted DeLay last year on money-laundering charges for transactions involving Texans for a Republican Majority (TRMPAC), a political action committee DeLay founded. Earle is a Democrat and DeLay has attacked the charges as ""a political hit job."" He says he did not personally carry out the transactions and that, in any case, they are standard practice for parties around the country. Regardless, DeLay was forced to vacate his post as majority leader because of a House Republican rule (known as ""the DeLay rule,"" because it was enacted amid concern about his legal situation) that requires a leader under indictment to step down.

    DeLay, a Baptist born in the border city of Laredo, said he ""spent a lot of time"" praying about his decision and that his personal relationship with Jesus drives his day-to-day actions. ""My faith is who I am,"" he said. When DeLay was booked on the Texas charges, he wore his Congressional I.D. pin and flashed a broad smile designed to thwart Democrats who had hoped to make wide use of an image of a glowering DeLay. ""I said a little prayer before I actually did the fingerprint thing, and the picture,"" he said. ""My prayer was basically: 'Let people see Christ through me. And let me smile.' Now, when they took the shot, from my side, I thought it was fakiest smile I'd ever given. But through the camera, it was glowing. I mean, it had the right impact. Poor old left couldn't use it at all.""

    Recently, he said, he has been hearing from many people who want his help on projects outside Congress. He said his decision was cemented by the thunderous response at a conference in Washington last Wednesday decrying the ""War on Christianity.""

    ""You talk to a lot of people, give a lot of people opportunities to give you message,"" DeLay said. ""If it's the wrong decision, doors don't open - they're closed to you, and you don't feel good about it, and you have doubts. Doors are opening already."" He said he has no plans to write a book. ""I'm not a very good writer, "" he said. In what must be a relief to his many lawyers, he said he has not kept a diary.

But never you mind.  He'll be back.  These bastards always come back.  How many Watergate operatives still work in government?  Seems like the GOP always has a place for crooks in its ranks.  And not just him.  If Santorum loses his Senate seat in Pennsylvania?  You wait and see -- he'll have some appointed federal position in a jiffy.    John Ashcroft lost his Senate seat to a dead man and a few months later he was the top prosecutor in the USA, thanks to his buddy W. 

So enjoy it for now.  Enjoy, yes indeedy.  Enjoy especially the continuing disarray this is sure to bring down upon the increasingly aimless GOP in the short term.  But the DeLays of that party are all just heads on a hydra anyway, and you can't stop hacking away at them for even a second.  Vigilance!"

My dad came into my room holding his hat
I knew he was leaving,
He sat on my bed told me ""Thanks son.
Son, I have the duty, calling on me
You and your sister be brave, my little soldier,
And don't forget all I told ya:
You're the mister of the house now remember this
And when you wake up in the morning give ya momma a kiss.""
Then I had to say goodbye...
In the morning woke momma with a kiss on each eyelid,
Even though I'm only a kid
Certain things can't be hid
Momma grabbed me
Held me like I was made of gold
But left her inner stories untold
I said, ""Momma it will be alright
When daddy comes home... 
Tonight.""

[CHORUS]

The skin under my chin is exploding again.
I'm getting stress from some other children
I'm holding it in.
We taking sides like a politician
And if i get friction we get to fighting.
I'll defend my dad he's the best of all men
and whatever he's doing he's doing the right thing.
It's frightening, but it makes me mad, 
Why do all of these people seem to hate my dad?
And if that ain't enough now i get these spots.
I go to sleep every night with my stomache in knots
And what's more, i can hear momma next door
Explore the radio for reports of war.
And all we ever seem to do is hide the tears.
Seems like daddy been gone for years.
But he was right, now i'm geared up for the fight
And he would be proud of me.
[CHORUS]


My story stops here, lets be clear.
This scenario is happening everywhere.
And you ain't going to nirvana or far-vana,
You're coming right back here to live out your karma.
With even more drama than previously.
Seriously.
Just how many centuries have we been
waiting for someone else to make us free?
And we refuse to see
that people overseas suffer just like we:
Bad leadership and egos unfettered and free
Who feed on the people they're supposed to lead
I don't need good people to pray and wait
For the lord to make it all straight.
There's only now, do it right.
'Cos I don't want your daddy 
Leaving home tonight.

[CHORUS]"

"event","AP ran an article about Feinstein's surging popularity in the wake of his call for censure of Bush.  It points up everything thhat's right with Feingold, and everything that's wrong with a good chunk of the rest of the party.

Relevant excerpts:

    <i>""These Democratic pundits are all scared of the Republican base getting energized, but they're willing to pay the price of not energizing the Democratic base,"" [Feingold] said. ""It's an overly defensive and meek approach to politics.""</i>

Hell yeah, Russ.  Preach it.  We're never gonna retake the Presidency on a platform of ""We're pussies, but at least we're not evil.""

And in any case, this is too important an issue to let political considerations get in the way.  This is a time when someone has to take a moral stand, or else allow this Administration to initiate a full-on police state.  Ah, but Feingold's fellow Dems beg to differ, according to AP:

    <i>Many also see [the Senator's] effort as a distraction at a time when the Bush administration was on the ropes over Iraq and a since-scuttled port deal.

    ""It just takes us off discussions we ought to be having in this country on issues that really matter in people's lives,"" said Rep. Sherrod Brown, a liberal Democrat from Ohio who is running for Senate.</i>

Wait, what?  The fact that the President is breaking the law in order to spy on his own citizens doesn't matter in people's lives?  I'm sorry, I'm far more worried about myself, or my almost uniformly outspokenly liberal friends,  or the millions of American activists who dare to criticize our government, getting spied upon by a paranoid Imperial President -- especially this one, the one whose Administration also insists torture is legal -- than I am about a foreign ally owning a port."

"event","I don't usually forward these things, but I'm starting to get a gnawing feeling in the pit of my gut that this wiretapping thing is the edge of really huge precipice.  I can just see the police state that arises if Bush gets away with such a flagrant violation of law and of our privacy.  It's really very scary.

So here's a MoveOn petition you can sign, urging Senate Democrats to support Russ Feingold's call for censure of the President.  As of now, no Dems have sided with him, and in fact they've kept the proposal from coming to a vote because they're scared of being labelled ""pro-terrorist"" or something.  Fuck them.

http://political.moveon.org/censure/

Even if Dems do support Feingold on this, of course, the motion won't pass in a GOP-dominated Senate.

But especially in an election year, with Presidential candidates testing the waters for a run at the white house, I think it's important that progressives make their voices heard on issues like this, so that our concerns are considered when organizations like the DNC start thinking about who to throw their support behind in 2008.

Me, I'm a Russ Feingold supporter all the way in 2008, should he choose to run.  Supporting his maverick stance against Bush and his ilk now makes it more likely that he <i>will</i> choose to run, and that he'll be taken seriously when the time comes.

I hope..."

"event","Article in today's NYTimes about ""mixed orientation"" marriages.  In other words, marriages in which one of the partners turns out to be gay.  Interesting piece... but here's one little factoid the writer just casually mentioned as though it was common knowledge:

""Such marriages are not just artifacts of the closeted 1950's. In the 16th century, Queen Anne of Denmark had eight children with King James I of England, <b>known not only for the King James Bible, but also for his devotion to male favorites, one of whom he called 'my sweet child and wife.'""</b>

What the... I mean... wait... WHA?

Are you telling me, New York Times, that the man behind the most revered Biblical translation in evangelist culture -- a translation which evangelists insist demonstrates conclusively that God Hates Fags -- <b>WAS A HOMOSEXUAL?!</b>

And this unimaginable hypocrisy hasn't been trumpted to the skies by the gay community for <i>what</i> reason???"

Bush guarantees these people -- ON TAPE -- that they will get all the federal assistance they need in the wake of the storm.

This is 19 hours before the storm hits.

As we all know, that federal assistance ends up taking days to arrive.

And four days after the storm, Bush excuses the slow federal response by saying ""I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.""

AP calls that a ""contradiction.""  I call that a LIE.  This incompetent Administration left thousands to die, victims of a disaster they had been warned might come.  Then they set up Michael Brown -- who actually tried to save some of those lives by alerting the Administration to the seriousness of the storm -- to take a fall.

It's a top headline on the WashPost frontpage, but the NYTimes inexplciably downplays the incident, and leaves it as the second headline of their ""Nation"" section.  I cannot for the life of me understand that."

BC-Katrina-Video, 1st Ld-Writethru,1,300
AP Exclusive: <b>Video shows Bush, Chertoff clearly warned before
Katrina struck</b>

By MARGARET EBRAHIM
and
JOHN SOLOMON
Associated Press Writers

      WASHINGTON (AP) - In dramatic and sometimes agonizing terms,
federal disaster officials warned President Bush and his homeland
security chief before Hurricane Katrina struck that the storm could
breach levees, put lives at risk in New Orleans' Superdome and
overwhelm rescuers, according to confidential video footage.

      Bush didn't ask a single question during the final briefing
before Katrina struck on Aug. 29, but he assured
soon-to-be-battered state officials: ""We are fully prepared.""

      The footage - along with seven days of transcripts of briefings
obtained by The Associated Press - show in excruciating detail that
while federal officials anticipated the tragedy that unfolded in
New Orleans and elsewhere along the Gulf Coast, they were fatally
slow to realize they had not mustered enough resources to deal with
the unprecedented disaster.

      Linked by secure video, Bush's confidence on Aug. 28 starkly
contrasts with the dire warnings his disaster chief and a cacophony
of federal, state and local officials provided during the four days
before the storm.

      A top hurricane expert voiced ""grave concerns"" about the
levees and then-Federal Emergency Management Agency chief Michael
Brown told the president and Homeland Security Secretary Michael
Chertoff that he feared there weren't enough disaster teams to help
evacuees at the Superdome.

      ""I'm concerned about ... their ability to respond to a
catastrophe within a catastrophe,"" Brown told his bosses the
afternoon before Katrina made landfall.

      Some of the footage and transcripts from briefings Aug. 25-31
conflicts with the defenses that federal, state and local officials
have made in trying to deflect blame and minimize the political
fallout from the failed Katrina response:

      -Homeland Security officials have said the ""fog of war""
blinded them early on to the magnitude of the disaster. But the
video and transcripts show federal and local officials discussed
threats clearly, reviewed long-made plans and understood Katrina
would wreak devastation of historic proportions. ""I'm sure it will
be the top 10 or 15 when all is said and done,"" National Hurricane
Center's Max Mayfield warned the day Katrina lashed the Gulf Coast.
      ""I don't buy the `fog of war' defense,"" Brown told the AP in
an interview Wednesday. ""It was a fog of bureaucracy.""

      -Bush declared four days after the storm, ""I don't think
anybody anticipated the breach of the levees"" that gushed deadly
flood waters into New Orleans. But the transcripts and video show
there was plenty of talk about that possibility - and Bush was
worried too.
      White House deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin, Louisiana Gov.
Kathleen Blanco and Brown discussed fears of a levee breach the day
the storm hit.
      ""I talked to the president twice today, once in Crawford and
then again on Air Force One,"" Brown said. ""He's obviously
watching the television a lot, and he had some questions about the
Dome, he's asking questions about reports of breaches.""

      -Louisiana officials angrily blamed the federal government for
not being prepared but the transcripts shows they were still
praising FEMA as the storm roared toward the Gulf Coast and even
two days afterward. ""I think a lot of the planning FEMA has done
with us the past year has really paid off,"" Col. Jeff Smith,
Louisiana's emergency preparedness deputy director, said during the
Aug. 28 briefing.

      It wasn't long before Smith and other state officials sounded
overwhelmed.

      ""We appreciate everything that you all are doing for us, and
all I would ask is that you realize that what's going on and the
sense of urgency needs to be ratcheted up,"" Smith said Aug. 30.

      Mississippi begged for more attention in that same briefing.

      ""We know that there are tens or hundreds of thousands of people
in Louisiana that need to be rescued, but we would just ask you, we
desperately need to get our share of assets because we'll have
people dying - not because of water coming up, but because we can't
get them medical treatment in our affected counties,"" said a
Mississippi state official whose name was not mentioned on the
tape.

      Video footage of the Aug. 28 briefing, the final one before
Katrina struck, showed an intense Brown voicing concerns from the
government's disaster operation center and imploring colleagues to
do whatever was necessary to help victims.

      ""We're going to need everything that we can possibly muster,
not only in this state and in the region, but the nation, to
respond to this event,"" Brown warned. He called the storm ""a bad
one, a big one"" and implored federal agencies to cut through red
tape to help people, bending rules if necessary.

      ""Go ahead and do it,"" Brown said. ""I'll figure out some way
to justify it. ... Just let them yell at me.""

      Bush appeared from a narrow, windowless room at his vacation
ranch in Texas, with his elbows on a table. Hagin was sitting
alongside him. Neither asked questions in the Aug. 28 briefing.

      ""I want to assure the folks at the state level that we are
fully prepared to not only help you during the storm, but we will
move in whatever resources and assets we have at our disposal after
the storm,"" the president said.

      A relaxed Chertoff, sporting a polo shirt, weighed in from
Washington at Homeland Security's operations center. He would later
fly to Atlanta, outside of Katrina's reach, for a bird flu event.

      One snippet captures a missed opportunity on Aug. 28 for the
government to have dispatched active-duty military troops to the
region to augment the National Guard.

      Chertoff: ""Are there any DOD assets that might be available?
Have we reached out to them?""
      Brown: ""We have DOD assets over here at EOC (emergency
operations center). They are fully engaged. And we are having those
discussions with them now.""
      Chertoff: ""Good job.""

      In fact, active duty troops weren't dispatched until days after
the storm. And many states' National Guards had yet to be deployed
to the region despite offers of assistance, and it took days before
the Pentagon deployed active-duty personnel to help overwhelmed
Guardsmen.

      The National Hurricane Center's Mayfield told the final briefing
before Katrina struck that storm models predicted minimal flooding
inside New Orleans during the hurricane but he expressed concerns
that counterclockwise winds and storm surges afterward could cause
the levees at Lake Pontchartrain to be overrun.

      ""I don't think any model can tell you with any confidence right
now whether the levees will be topped or not but that is obviously
a very, very grave concern,"" Mayfield told the briefing.

      Other officials expressed concerns about the large number of New
Orleans residents who had not evacuated.

      ""They're not taking patients out of hospitals, taking prisoners
out of prisons and they're leaving hotels open in downtown New
Orleans. So I'm very concerned about that,"" Brown said.

      Despite the concerns, it ultimately took days for search and
rescue teams to reach some hospitals and nursing homes.

      Brown also told colleagues one of his top concerns was whether
evacuees who went to the New Orleans Superdome - which became a
symbol of the failed Katrina response - would be safe and have
adequate medical care.

      ""The Superdome is about 12 feet below sea level.... I don't
know whether the roof is designed to stand, withstand a Category
Five hurricane,"" he said.

      Brown also wanted to know whether there were enough federal
medical teams in place to treat evacuees and the dead in the
Superdome.

      ""Not to be (missing) kind of gross here,"" Brown interjected,
""but I'm concerned"" about the medical and mortuary resources
""and their ability to respond to a catastrophe within a
catastrophe.""

No, motherfucker, here's a terrible cartoon:  

You start a war of choice in a powderkeg country, send in nowhere near enough troops to secure the peace or to rebuild the country after you've flattened it, then neglect to outfit the troops with enough body armor to protect them when insurgents blow their fucking limbs off with roadside bombs.  That's a sick, twisted awful cartoon.  And you've made it a reality.

Now, dear Chiefs of Staff, please shut the fuck up about an editorial cartoon that clearly expresses sympathy for the soldiers' plight... and is obviously making a point about Rumsfeld's lack thereof.  Seems to me you should be more preoccupied with somehow pulling our soldiers out of the quagmire you created."

"event","Happy voting day, my fellow Californians!  You can tell its voting day because you see lots of people hanging around polling stations, looking through their little voter guides, trying to figure out what the hell is up with the latest ballot propositions, and they all have that look on their face.  The one that's like: ""Wha?""

Yes, there is no questions that ballot measures -- conceived to make legislatures more responsive to the will of the people -- have become a bewildering political minefield that's constantly being gamed by special-interest groups.

Sadly, that's what we got.  And I find that instead of trying to glean -- from the often completely contradictory For/Against statements in the voter guide -- what the hell the ballots mean and what their actual ramifications are, it helps to turn to the reliably progressive L.A. Weekly.  They publish a list of measures, and why you should or shouldn't approve 'em.

<a href=""http://www.laweekly.com/ink/05/50/news-endorsements.php""><u>Check it out</u></a>, paying special attention to Props 78 and 79.  They're both aimed at reducing the cost of prescription drugs... except 78 is supported by pharmaceutical companies.  Guess which one has no teeth?

Have fun, and if you see me on the street today be sure and say ""hello.""  I'll be the guy with the ""I Voted"" sticker."

"event","I haven't followed recent French politics enough to fully understand everything that led to the ongoing riots throughout France.  I've spoken with several learned people who believe it was justifiable and inevitable.  That it's the government's price to pay for failing to address widespread miniority poverty, and for a deeply flawed immigration ideology that insists upon immigrants shedding their former cultural identity in the name of French ""unity.""

I believe that's all true.  But I also can't help but feel terribly saddened by it all.  And I can't help but feel that this is a far cry from France's student revolts of the sixties, to which the riots are being compared.  It seems to me the students were fighting for a better life for all of France and the world, whereas these rioters are more narrowly focused on their own misery.  That's totally understandble, but also frightening.  The rage is less directed, more inchoate.  I don't think even the rioters have any idea how their many greivances can be voiced and appeased.  I also fear that many of the organizations that may now try to speak on behalf of the rioters will be doing so to further questionable political and (more creepily) religious goals.  Moreover, in a country in which huge, peaceful strikes and demonstrations are not only a cherished, protected means of free speech, but are actually demonstrably effective in influencing public sentiment and government policy (see France's defiant stand against the Iraq war)... I feel like violence didn't have to be the answer.  

Again, that's a layman's take on the situation.  And perhaps I'm too willing to give the benefit of a doubt to a government which -- in the face of encroaching corporate capitalism -- still seems to be trying to cling to some socialist protections for its citizens.  But I'd like to point out a rather amazing three sentences from today's L.A. Times coverage:

<i>Police did not shoot back. Under strict orders from Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, the police have not fired a single shot since the riots began, Hamon said. Rioters reportedly fired on police about half a dozen times.</i>

Say what you will about the failures of the French government -- and they seem to be many -- there still seems to be a morality to the way they confront crises that we in the States might have reason to admire."

"event","... That's a neat summation of the GOP political strategy.  If an opponent exposes your weaknesses, never acknowledge them.  Never accquiesce.  Smear the opponent.  Attack <i>their</i> weaknesses.  Admit nothing.

Case in point: Tom Delay.  He makes his first appearance in a Texas court and within minutes his lawyer makes a motion for judge Bob Perkins to recuse himself from the case.  Why?  Because he's a Democrat who contributed small amounts of money to Democratic organizations and campaigns.

Arguments haven't even begun and already Delay and his lawyers are smearing, insinuating, undermining anyone who could potentially stand in judgement of them.  Now, no doubt -- as with prosecuting attorney Ronnie Earle -- there will be articles exploring the judge's background, his every donation to a Democratic or liberal cause suddenly subject to speculation.  The AP story notes that Delay ""did not speak during the brief [court] session that at times appeared more like a campaign debate than a legal proceeding.""  Silly AP!  It <i>was</i> a campaign debate!  Delay and his ilk don't give a damn about justice or morality.  Everything is an opportunity to consolidate power and crush the enemy.  Who needs a defense when you can launch an attack?

Here's the funny part: Judge Perkins has delayed court proceedings and is allowing an Administrative judge -- B.B. Shraub -- to rule on whether he should remain on the case.  Here's the Administrative judge's stats, according to the AP:

<i>Schraub, from 1989 through 2002,
contributed at least $1,500 to federal Republican campaigns,
according to disclosure reports compiled by the Center for
Responsive Politics. He donated an additional $4,900 to Texas GOP
candidates between 1998 and 2001, according to state disclosure
reports analyzed by a public interest group, Texans for Public
Justice.</i>

My guess is Schraub isn't going to interfere.  Bu even if that's the case, Delay has clearly hedged his bets with this move.  If Delay is convicted with Perkins presiding, he'll just continue to cry ""partisan smear campaign."" 

Meanwhile, please note: Big GOP Politician screams for the recusal of what he deems a politically compromised judge.  Where was Delay a year or so back, when Democrats were calling for Supreme Court Justice Scalia to recuse himself from a case after it was revealed he'd recently gone duck-hunting with one of the defendants: Dick Cheney?

[note: in an earlier version of this post I identified Perkins as an appointed federal judge, and made an argument based on that fact.  I got the detail from a short ""alert"" that has since vanished from the newswires and I can't verify if he actually was an appointed judge or an elected one.  The case is being heard in a county court so it's likely he was elected.]"

BC-DeLay Indictment, 1st Ld-Writethru,330
<b>Court issues warrant for DeLay, sets $10,000 bond</b>
Eds: ADDS 5 grafs of background
By SUZANNE GAMBOA
Associated Press Writer

      AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A Texas court issued a warrant Wednesday
for former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay to appear for booking,
where he is likely to face the fingerprinting and photo mug shot he
had hoped to avoid.
      Bail was initially set at $10,000 as a routine step before his
first court appearance on conspiracy and money laundering charges.
Travis County court officials said DeLay was ordered to appear at
the Fort Bend County jail for booking.
      The warrant was ""a matter of routine and bond will be posted,""
DeLay attorney Dick DeGuerin said.
      The lawyer declined to say when DeLay would surrender to
authorities but said the lawmaker would make his first court
appearance Friday morning.
      The charges against the Texas Republican stem from allegations
that a DeLay-founded Texas political committee funneled corporate
money into state GOP legislative races through the National
Republican Party. Texas law prohibits use of corporate money to
elect state candidates.
      DeLay is charged with conspiracy to violate state election laws
and money laundering, felony counts that triggered House Republican
rules that forced him to step aside as majority leader.
      Two separate indictments charge that DeLay and two political
associates had the money distributed to state legislative
candidates in a roundabout way - sending it from the political
action committee in Texas to the Republican National Committee in
Washington and finally back to candidates' campaigns.
      DeLay has denied wrongdoing.
      The effort had major political consequences, first by helping
Republicans take control of the Texas Legislature in the 2002
elections. The Legislature then redrew congressional boundaries
according to a DeLay-inspired plan, took command of the state's
U.S. House delegation and helped the GOP retain its U.S. House
majority."

<b>Insurgents Seize Key Town in Iraq
Al Qaeda in Iraq's Black Banner Flying From Rooftops</b>

By Ellen Knickmeyer
Washington Post Foreign Service
Monday, September 5, 2005; 1:03 PM



BAGHDAD, Sept. 5 -- Abu Musab Zarqawi's foreign-led Al Qaeda in Iraq took open control of a key western town at the Syrian border, deploying its guerrilla fighters in the streets and flying Zarqawi's black banner from rooftops, tribal leaders and other residents in the city and surrounding villages said.

A sign newly posted at the entrance of Qaim declared, ""Welcome to the Islamic Kingdom of Qaim."" A statement posted in mosques described Qaim as an ""Islamic kingdom liberated from the occupation.""

Zarqawi's fighters were killing officials and civilians seen as government-allied or anti-Islamic, witnesses, residents and others said. On Sunday, the bullet-riddled body of a woman lay in a street of Qaim. A sign left on her corpse declared, ""A prostitute who was punished.""

Zarqawi's fighters had shot to death nine men in public executions in the city center since the weekend, accusing the men of being spies and collaborators for U.S. forces, said Sheikh Nawaf Mahallawi, a leader of a Sunni Arab tribe, the Albu Mahal, that had battled the foreign fighters.

Dozens of families were fleeing Qaim daily, Mahallawi said.

""It would be insane to attack Zarqawi's people, even to shoot one bullet at them,"" Mahallawi said. ""We cannot attack them. But we will not stand still if they attack us. We hope the U.S. forces end this in the coming days. We want the city to go back to its normal situation.""

U.S. Marine spokesman Capt. Jeffrey Pool in Ramadi, capital of the western province that includes Qaim, said Marines in the area of Qaim had no word of any unusual activity in Qaim. Numerous Marines are stationed near the town, although Marines said they were not involved in recent ground fighting between pro-government tribal fighters and Zarqawi's group.

Qaim, within a few miles of the Syrian border, has been a major stronghold for insurgents ferrying fighters, weapons and money from Syria into the rest of Iraq along a network of Euphrates River towns.

Many of the towns along the river have appeared to be heavily under the insurgents' domination, despite repeated Marine offenses along the river since May. Residents and Marines have described insurgents escaping ahead of the offensives, and returning when the offensives are over.

While the stepped-up U.S. offensives have been unable to drive out insurgents permanently, the U.S. attacks are credited by some with helping disrupt insurgent networks and reduce the number of car-bombings and suicide attacks in the rest of Iraq.

U.S. Marines last week launched days of air strikes against suspected insurgent safe houses in the area, in some of the heaviest known uses of air power in recent months. A Sunni Arab tribe, the Albu Mahal tribe, simultaneously vowed to drive Zarqawi's fighters from the area, with the aid of the U.S. air strikes.

U.S. and Iraqi officials welcomed what they called signs that insurgents were losing support from their Sunni Arab base in the west.

By the weekend, however, Zarqawi's forces had fought back and taken control of Qaim, residents said. Accounts from the town described a rare, prolonged overt presence of the foreign fighters.

The Albu Mahal tribe as of Sunday remained in control of its village outside the city. However, a car bomb placed by Zarqawi's fighters in front of the home of a tribal leader, Sheikh Dhyad Ahmed, killed the sheikh and his son on Sunday, resident Mijbil Saied said.

It was unclear whether any Iraqi forces were in Qaim. A Zarqawi fighter said any Marines and Iraqi forces had left Qaim, with ""nothing left of their crosses.""

Armed insurgent fighters loyal to the Jordanian-born Zarqawi openly traveled Qaim's streets. The fighters included both Iraqis and foreigners, including Afghans The foreign-led fighters hung rooftops with Zarqawi's al-Qaeda banner of black backgrounds with a yellow sun.

Shops selling CDs, a movie theater and a women's beauty parlor were newly burned, apparently targeted by Zarqawi's group under its strict interpretation of Islamic law.

Residents said Zarqawi's fighters were killing most government workers, but had spared doctors and teachers.

Karim Hammad Karbouli, a 46-year-old resident still in Qaim, said he was waiting only for his brother to come with a pickup truck so Karbouli could load up his household and leave. Karbouli said he feared both Zarqawi's fighters and U.S. bombs.

Zarqawi's fighters had taken control of the town's hospital, one of its medical workers, Dr. Muhammed Ismail, said. The hospital's director then ordered all patients to leave, fearing the presence of Zarqawi's fighters would draw air strikes on the clinic, Ismail said.

Zarqawi fighters manned checkpoints on the four entrances to the city.

U.S. spokesman Lt. Col. Steven Boylan, in Baghdad, said that any redeployment of forces back to the United States to help with the aftermath of hurricane Katrina would not affect the U.S. ability to carry out air strikes. The Air Force announced over the weekend it was sending home 300 Air Force members whose base is in Mississippi.

Yep!  Here in this formerly secular country, a faction of the movement that destroyed the world trade center has now taken control of a town on the edge of the Syrian border and declared it ""an Islamic Kingdom.""  They're murdering the local officials and enacting their own personal brand of righteous fanatic justice on prostitutes -- by killing them.

"event","A while back I wrote, in this space, about hegemones.  Superpowers like Rome or Britain.  How they tend to rise and fall the same way over the course of history.  Main problem?  Hegemones get too big for their britches and spend more time and resources policing far-flung sections of their Empire than with maintaining the welfare of their citizens.  The U.S., I argued, might very well be entering this twilight phase of its hegemonic rule, as evidenced by the Bush Administration's last budget, which opted for increased military spending at the cost of thousands of domestic infrastructure programs. 

Here we are eight or so months later, and we're now seeing a terrible example of what happens in a hegemone in decline.

It has been known for some time that the city of New Orleans would be in deep trouble should it be hit by a major storm.  The city's Times-Picayune newspaper has <a href=""http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/090105I.shtml""><u>at least nine articles going back to 2004</u></a> in which it warns of a disaster in the making should New Orleans' subsiding levees be breached.  In 2001, <a href=""http://www.salon.com/opinion/blumenthal/2005/08/31/disaster_preparation/index_np.html""><u>The Federal Emergency Managment Association warned a New Orleans hurricane was among the three most likliest disasters to hit the U.S.A.</u></a>  More recently, Louisianan officials tried in vain to convince the federal government that the subsidances were a problem of national security proportions.

Yes, we've known these things for a long while.  So when President Bush -- yanked reluctantly from his long vacation -- said on national television today that no one had any idea the levees would break?  That was an example of either monumental cluelessness, or a lie.

Nothing was done to protect New Orleans.  Why?  Not enough money.

Somehow, though, America found plenty of money to fight Bush's war of choice in Iraq.  Billions of dollars, in fact.  We've had plenty of money with which to pay Halliburton for its ""reconstruction"" efforts in Iraq.  We've flung so much taxpayer cash into this burning quagmire in the Middle East that there wasn't enough left over to plug some holes in the walls that stood between flood waters and thousands upon thousands of Americans, and their families, and their homes.  When the final body count is tallied, no one doubts more people will have died as a result of this flood than died in the 9/11 attacks. 

I'm no isolationist.  I'm all for spending money abroad to fight injustices.  But we didn't go to Iraq to fight injustice.  We went there for oil, and politics, and so W could wreak some sort of personal vengeance.  And putting all that aside -- what is the point of fighting for justice abroad when our own country is literally falling to pieces?  An airline attendant will tell you that when an airplane cabin suddenly depressurizes, you put the oxygen mask first on yourself... and THEN on the face of the children you want to protect.  You're no good to anyone if you're suffocating.  This country has been starving for air and the Administration put the mask on Iraq.  Now our own people are literally dead in the water and we are facing the very real possibility of a national -- possibly even global -- recession, all triggered by a disaster we didn't have the cash to prepare for.

My hope is this wakes people up, and we start putting our resources where they're needed.  But with an Adminstration in power that seems amazingly eager to ignore reality even at the expense of thousands of lives, my guess is we'll continue happily speeding down the road to hegemonic ruin.  

In some ways, that's fine with me.  As I've said before -- Rome became Italy... a nice, mellow place to be once they stopped trying to rule the planet.  But what worries me is that these days, our superpower heir apparent is China.  Now, I recently went to China.  It's an amazing, wonderful place.  But it's also a country whose general recently threatened to use nukes against the U.S. in any confrontation over Taiwan, a country that generally doesn't allow its citizens to leave its borders, a country that's recently come under fire for jailing a journalist for years without charges, and a country that's polluted itself to such an incredible extent (really, I live in Los Angeles and I've <i>never</i> seen smog like Beijing smog) that migratory bird paths have been disrupted -- a major cause of the Avian flu epidemic.  In other words: as nuts as we are, we're still the best hegemonic option out there.  But if we keep gutting oursleves like this, we'll be leaving the world to a country that really isn't ready to make the planet any better."

--

<b>Reproductive rights.</b> In a brief before the Supreme Court (Rust v. Sullivan, 500 US 173, 1991), Roberts wrote:

""We continue to believe that Roe was wrongly decided and should be overruled. As more fully explained in our briefs, filed as amicus curiae, in Hodgson v. Minnesota, 110 S.

Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U.S. 416 (1983), the Court's conclusions in Roe that there is a fundamental right to an abortion and that government has no compelling interest in protecting prenatal human life throughout pregnancy find no support in the text, structure, or history of the Constitution."" 
It is likely that Roberts's own opinion on abortion and birth control will be questioned during his confirmation hearings before the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary.

<b>Enviromental regulation.</b> Roberts has often, both in his public and private work, taken a position against government environmental regulation. Roberts argued against the private citizen's right to sue the federal government for violations of environmental regulations in Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation."

Yep, it's video from yesterday's wonderful little Press Conference with Scott McClellan.  More like a press <i>evisceration,</i> actually, as the gathered reporters rip Bush's pudgy worm of a spokesman several new orifices.  

It's my favorite video ever.  

Here's a play-by-play:

McClellan opens with a solemn statement from Bush about the ten-year anniversary of the Srebenica massacre.  McClellan can't pronounce ""Srebenica"" properly.  He also mangles the names of the massacre's ringleaders.  Meanwhile Bush, in his statement, quickly spins the tragedy for political gain, implying it's a justification for his ""war"" on terrorism (writes Bush, ""[Srebenica is] a grim reminder that there are evil people who will kill the innocent without conscience or mercy""). 

Then McClellan opens the floor to questions.  And is promptly peppered with the first of what will 30-plus pointed inquiries about Karl Rove's potential criminal involvement in outing the identity of covert agent Valerie Plame.

More than that many, actually, because each reporter ends up asking and rephrasing their questions several times, in an attempt to get an actual <i>answer</i> out of McClellan.  

But McClellan's been instructed to say nothing.  He says he can't comment about ""an ongoing investigation.""  This depite the fact that he's commented about the ongoing investigation on several previous occasions.  

This only fuels the fire.  The questions keep coming.  ""You can keep asking,"" McClellan says at one point, ""But you have my answer.""

""Well, we <i>are</i> gonna keep asking,"" says one reporter, who proceeds to do just that.

""You're in tough spot here, Scott,"" says another reporter.

""Scott, this is ridiculous,"" says another.

There are few brief respites.  Like when a foreign reporter lobs a softball about the London bombings and allows McClellan to settle into the familiar old ""ongoing war on terrorism"" shpiel.  It has never sound so clearly false.  Scripted.  The evasions on Rove are going to color everything McClellan says today.

He finishes the terrorism speech.  Bang, another question about Rove.  McClellan refuses to answer.

Another foreign reporter asks about a rumored U.S. pullout from the Iraq war.  McClellan rambles about our troops ""returning home with honor.""  It's really amazing how obvious all the bullshit seems.  You can almost see McClellan's nose growing longer. 

He winds up his Iraq answer.

Bang.  Another Rove question.  McClellan says for the umpteenth time that ""No one wants to get to the bottom of this more than the President.""  But he still won't give one example of what the President is doing, has done, or will do to clear the air.

A conservative reporter asks about potential Supreme Court nominees, which McClellan also won't talk about... and then the reporter can't help but follow up with his own Karl Rove question.  He wonders if Karl will continue giving ""excellent"" policy speeches.  The other reporters actually laugh at the blatant idiot partisanship.  

And then we're back to Karl Rove questions.  ""Do you have questions on another topic?"" McClellan asks.  It's almost a plea. 

""Are you concerned that in not setting the record straight today,"" asks a reporter a minute later, ""That this could undermine the credibility of the other things you say from the podium?""  

It's the one question of the day that didn't need to be asked.  The answer was clear.

Good God, this is glorious.  Enjoy."

From the Associated Press: <lj-cut text=""House Approves Flag-Burning Amendment"">

<b>House Approves Flag-Burning Amendment</b>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
The Associated Press
Wednesday, June 22, 2005; 4:45 PM



WASHINGTON -- The House on Wednesday approved a constitutional amendment that would give Congress the power to ban desecration of the American flag, a measure that for the first time stands a chance of passing the Senate as well.

By a 286-130 vote _ eight more than needed _ House members approved the amendment after a debate over whether such a ban would uphold or run afoul of the Constitution's free-speech protections.

Approval of two-thirds of the lawmakers present was required to send the bill on to the Senate, where activists on both sides say it stands the best chance of passage in years. If the amendment is approved in that chamber by a two-thirds vote, it would then move to the states for ratification.

Supporters said the measure reflected patriotism that deepened after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and they accused detractors of being out of touch with public sentiment.

""Ask the men and women who stood on top of the (World) Trade Center,"" said Rep. Randy (Duke) Cunningham, R-Calif. ""Ask them and they will tell you: pass this amendment.""

But Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said, ""If the flag needs protection at all, it needs protection from members of Congress who value the symbol more than the freedoms that the flag represents.""

The measure was designed to overturn a 1989 decision by the Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 that flag burning was a protected free-speech right. That ruling threw out a 1968 federal statute and flag-protection laws in 48 states. The law was a response to anti-Vietnam war protesters setting fire to the American flag at their demonstrations.

The proposed one-line amendment to the Constitution reads, ""The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States."" For the language to be added to the Constitution, it must be approved not only by two-thirds of each chamber but also by 38 states within seven years.

Each time the proposed amendment has come to the House floor, it has reached the required two-thirds majority. But the measure has always died in the Senate, falling short of the 67 votes needed. The last time the Senate took up the amendment was in 2000, when it failed 63-37.

But last year's elections gave Republicans a four-seat pickup in the Senate, and now proponents and critics alike say the amendment stands within a vote or two of reaching the two-thirds requirement in that chamber.

By most counts, 65 current senators have voted for or said they intend to support the amendment, two shy of the crucial tally. More than a quarter of current senators were not members of that chamber during the last vote.

The Senate is expected to consider the measure after the July 4th holiday.

_

The amendment is H.J. Res 10.

-- </lj-cut>

The operative quote from this story:

""Supporters said the measure reflected patriotism that deepened after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and they accused detractors of being out of touch with public sentiment.""

Whoa!  Out of step with public sentiment!  This coming from Congressfollk?  So I guess this means that lawmakers are going to start paying attention to public sentiment?  Great!  

They can start by promising never to interfere in personal right-to-die cases, as they did with Terry Schiavo despite enormous opposition from nearly every segment of the public.

Then they can promise to start extricating us from the Iraq war, which a majority of the public now feels ""wasn't worth getting involved in.""

They can also move to legalize stem-cell research, also backed by a majority of Americans.

And they can stop trying to privatize Social Security, which a growing majority of the public is against despite months of concentrated effort by the GOP to convince us otheriwse.

Or wait!  Maybe these lawmakers are just hypocritical assholes wrapping themselves in the flag to distract us from the very real specters of social and economic collapse they've predicated with five years of regressive policies!

No, no, that couldn't be it."

It'll be interesting to see

a.) What prompted this admission and
b.) What this'll do to the current superheated debate about use of anonymous sources in journalism.  Everyone from the President of the United States to newspaper editors are discouraging reporters from using 'em.  Does no one recall that it was an anonymous source who facilitated the greatest journalistic coup of the century and deservedly removed a corrupt President from office?"

--

We are hours away from the vote to save the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the heat is on thanks to your efforts over the last 24 hours. A vote is expected around 1:00 PM EST and floor debate begins at 10:15 AM EST. Tune in and watch live on C-SPAN2. 

In the last 24 hours we have seen an amazing display of our johnkerry.com community's ability to quickly mobilize - and a passionate outpouring of commitment to the Arctic Refuge. And you got the attention of the Republicans too. In fact late last night Republican leaders came to the floor of the Senate to complain directly about our Citizens' Roll Call to stop this special interest giveaway.

So far, a quarter of a million citizens - more than 260,000 people, have signed our Citizens' Roll Call in support of the Cantwell-Kerry Amendment to prevent the oil drills from invading one of our greatest natural treasures. With the roll call vote in the Senate fast approaching TODAY, we must keep the pressure on - and our Citizens' Roll Call growing. 

Sign the Citizens' Roll Call today:

http://www.johnkerry.com/RollCall

With support from grassroots activists across the nation, we are running an online advertising campaign in six critical states that are home to the Republican senators who now hold the future of the Arctic Refuge in their hands.

If you haven't acted yet, please take ONE minute now to sign the roll call and, if you've already signed, use that minute to forward this message to friends and colleagues.

The vote that could decide the future of the Arctic Refuge is going down to the wire. Let's keep working until we win. Your actions today are making a critical difference. 
Sincerely,

John Kerry

P.S. If you can help fund these online ads in the decisive, closing moments of this historic environmental debate, that would be a great help.

"event","I remember my ""World Politics"" class.  I think it was sophomore year of college, 1989 or so.  Can't recall the professor's name, but one of his lessons really stuck in my head.  IT was all about the rise and fall of hegemones.

Hegemones.  Read: ""superpowers.""  They tend to collapse in predictable ways, he said.  Greece, Rome, The British Empire, all of 'em -- greatness to less-than-greatness, the same way every time.

He said the cycle tends to take about 100 years.  I remember that vividly, because I did some math in my head.  Let's see... The U.S. (arguably) rises to superpowerdom right around its entry into WWII... that gave us fifty years, probably less, before we were no longer the big man on the global campus.  Not so very long.  And we were probably already at or past our superpower prime.  All downhill from there. 

The professor also said Hegemones in decline are characterized by an expensive, expanding military... coupled with a corresponding lack of re-investment in domestic infrastructure.  While Rome's army struggled to keep the natives in its far-flung Empire from rebelling, the roads in Rome itself fell into ruin.

Well, here we are with 30-some years left in my generously-calculated life-cycle of U.S. hegemonic rule, and whaddya know, here's a headline from today's NYTimes:

<b>Bush Unveils Budget That Favors Security Over Social Spending</b> 
By DAVID STOUT  5:14 PM ET
<i>Many domestic programs would be slashed under the plan, while spending on the military and homeland security would rise.</i>

--

Sounds to me like my history professor was a real smart guy.

But hey, let's be optimistic.  Rome became Italy.  Best food on the planet.  A population that spends a lot of time sitting around enjoying coffee, wine, smokes, art and each other.  You have time and money to spend on that stuff when you're not trying to rule the fucking world."

Dear Mr. <lj user=""serious_songs"">,

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Please forgive this delayed response; it gets busy around here.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I too believe the story on the conclusion of the search for illicit weapons in Iraq should have been more prominent. My guess -- and this is strictly a guess that I haven't been able to confirm -- is that the item was hurried into the paper when the Washington Post broke the story that same day, and consequently was less detailed than it might otherwise have been. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, I don't think it belonged on Page One; Duelfer's original report, establishing the absence of WMD, was the key development here, and it received very prominent play over several days, including several appearances on Page One, when it was released last fall .
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

Yours sincerely,
Daniel Okrent
Public Editor
N.B.: Any opinions expressed here, unless otherwise indicated, are solely my own

Fair enough, I guess.  I still think it's one thing to publish a front-page story saying ""Duelfer says no WMD's in Iraq,"" and quite another to publish a story saying the Bush Administration has finally admitted as much and is bringing the search to a close.

But it's good to know there's a responsive person out there keeping an eye on things at the newspaper of record, y'know?  I doubt there's a similar position at FOX news."

<lj-cut text=""High court rules dog sniff during traffic stop OK without suspicion of drugs"">
<b>High court rules dog sniff during traffic stop OK without suspicion of drugs</b>
By HOPE YEN
Associated Press Writer
      WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court gave police broader search
powers Monday during traffic stops, ruling that <i>drug-sniffing dogs
can be used to check out motorists even if officers have no reason
to suspect they may be carrying narcotics.</i>
      In a 6-2 decision, the court sided with Illinois police who
stopped Roy Caballes in 1998 along Interstate 80 for driving 6
miles over the speed limit. Although Caballes lawfully produced his
driver's license, troopers brought over a drug dog after Caballes
seemed nervous.
      <i>Caballes argued the Fourth Amendment protects motorists from
searches such as dog sniffing, but Justice John Paul Stevens
disagreed, reasoning that <b>the privacy intrusion was minimal.</b></i>
      ""The dog sniff was performed on the exterior of respondent's
car while he was lawfully seized for a traffic violation. Any
intrusion on respondent's privacy expectations does not rise to the
level of a constitutionally cognizable infringement,"" Stevens
wrote.
      In a dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg bemoaned what she
called the broadening of police search powers, saying the use of
drug dogs will make routine traffic stops more ""adversarial."" She
was joined in her dissent in part by Justice David H. Souter.
      ""Injecting such animal into a routine traffic stop changes the
character of the encounter between the police and the motorist. The
stop becomes broader, more adversarial and (in at least some cases)
longer,"" she wrote.
      Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist did not participate in
consideration of the case.
      The case is another in a line of Supreme Court cases involving
the Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches or seizures.
      But civil liberties advocates have argued that allowing greater
police powers in this case would be more troubling. That's because
police often use traffic stops as a pretext to question motorists
about suspected illegal activity for which they have no proof.
      <i>In Caballes' case, he was pulled over for driving 71 mph on a

Bye bye, FCC Chairman Michael Powell.  Don't let the door hit you on the way out.  On second thought, let it hit you.  In the back of the head.  About a thousand times.

<b>Powell Is Stepping Down as Chairman of F.C.C.</b>
By STEPHEN LABATON and JOHN O'NEIL 
 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 - Michael K. Powell announced this afternoon that he would step down as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission in March, ending a four-year term that was marked by the tightening of standards on decency and attempts to loosen restrictions on media ownership. 

""During my tenure, we worked to get the law right in order to stimulate innovative technology that puts more power in the hands of the American people,"" Mr. Powell said in a statement on the F.C.C.'s Web site. ""Evidence of our success can be seen increasingly in the offices, the automobiles and the living rooms of the American consumer.""

Mr. Powell did not say what he would do after leaving the commission, other than ""spending some time off with my wife and two boys, before taking up my next challenge.""

Mr. Powell was appointed to the commission in 1997 by President Bill Clinton and promoted to chairman by President Bush in 2001. Associates of Mr. Powell's have reported for months that he planned to leave after the conclusion of Mr. Bush's first term. His decision to announce his retirement today was reported this morning in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal.

The replacements being considered for Mr. Powell are said by administration officials to include another Republican member of the commission, Kevin Martin; Becky Klein, a former head of the public utility commission in Texas; Patrick Wood III, the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and Michael Gallagher, head of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in the Commerce Department.

Mr. Powell, a Republican, brought an emphasis on deregulation to the commission, pushing what he described today as ""a bold and aggressive agenda.""

Under President Clinton, the commission was made up of three Democrats and two Republicans, but even in the minority, Mr. Powell was able to have a significant influence on many decisions. 

In a measure of his political adroitness, he did so without creating political opponents - a rare accomplishment in a field torn between competing industries, like long-distance and local phone carriers, or cable television and broadcasters. 

As chairman, however, he unveiled a more aggressive agenda and became the target of significant opposition, even among some of the Congressional Republicans who had been among his biggest supporters.

The most contentious issue of his term came with his proposal to relax the rules limiting how many broadcasting outlets one company could own in any given city. 

The new rules would have allowed broadcasting networks to acquire television stations that reach as many as 45 percent of the nation's viewers, up from 35 percent, and allowed a company to own up to eight radio and three TV stations, as well as a cable company, in the nation's biggest markets. 

The change was supported by big broadcasting and publishing companies and vigorously opposed by a coalition of smaller broadcasters and labor, consumer, artistic, religious and civil rights organizations. They argued that it would lead to a domination of the media by a few giant companies, stifling the chance for different points of view to be heard. Mr. Powell responded that the rise of the Internet and the multiplication of cable channels allowed for more voices to be heard than ever before. 

The proposal was passed by the commission in June 2003 along a party-line vote. 

Criticism of the move, however, crossed party lines and in September 2003 the Senate voted 55 to 40 in favor of a repeal of the rules. Twelve Republicans joined in the vote, which was seen as a personal rebuke to Mr. Powell and was only the second time the Senate had used a little-known rule to attempt, in effect, to veto an action by a regulator.

The effort failed to become law, but the rule change was blocked last year by a federal appeals court that said the commission had failed to justify the ruling. The commission can appeal the ruling or reopen hearings on the matter, but so far has not taken any action. 

Among the broader public, Mr. Powell was better known for the crackdown on indecency on the airwaves that he led after singer Janet Jackson bared a breast on live television during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004.

Over the rest of the year, the F.C.C. issued more than $7.7 million in fines, up from $48,000 in 2000. Mr. Powell praised the agency's enforcement officials for issuing the penalties, but the commission also overruled staff to broaden the indecency standard to make even a single fleeting utterance of profanity subject to sanctions. 

The crackdown was seen by the media industry as a departure from Mr. Powell. When he took over as chairman, he was seen as a defender of programming freedom, and was honored by a group supported by media companies and civil rights lawyers for his position that it was unfair to impose standards on broadcasters that their competitors in cable and satellite television did not face. 

Mr. Powell said the fines were made necessary by an ""increasing coarseness"" in programming driven by a quest for ratings, while the broadcasting community called him the most heavy-handed enforcer of speech restrictions in decades. 

Mr. Powell faced criticism from conservatives as well for not being even tougher, including from another Republican member of the commission, Kevin J. Martin. 

Mr. Martin was also behind a rare defeat for Mr. Powell, when the commission turned down his proposal in 2003 to deregulate the local telephone market. 

While Mr. Powell presided over the commission during a time of rapid technological change and regulatory turmoil, many big issues are still looming on its horizon. Industry observers say the F.C.C. is facing major decisions on telephone services over the Internet, new wireless services and high-speed Internet connections.

While many telecommunications issues do not always break down along party lines, President Bush's victory in November has led to predictions that policy makers will continue to favor the four regional Bell companies and the nation's largest media conglomerates. 

David P. Kaut, an analyst with Legg Mason, said in an e-mail message to clients that his firm does not expect any change in policy direction with Mr. Powell's departure. He said he looked for a continuation of decisions that have been ""generally in a deregulatory direction,"" except on indecency questions. 

Gene Kimmelman, a senior director for public policy at Consumers Union, said that Mr. Powell was leaving ""an enormous mess"" for whoever follows him. 

""I think he will go down in the record books as one of the poorer performers"" in the job, Mr. Kimmelman said. He pointed to a string of court decisions going against the agency, and the bipartisan opposition in Congress to what he called Mr. Powell's ""aggressive effort to allow a few companies to consolidate and dominate the media market."" 

Mr. Powell, 41, is the son of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is also stepping down from his post. The younger Mr. Powell followed his father's footsteps by joining the Army, but went to law school after being severely injured in a jeep accident in Germany. 

Before joining the commission, he worked briefly for Joel L. Klein, now the chancellor of New York City's schools and then the head of antitrust prosecution for the Justice Department in the Clinton Administration. Mr. Klein had been one of Mr. Powell's teachers at Georgetown University Law Center.

Of course, there's bad news.  To quote the Times:

""The replacements being considered for Mr. Powell are said by administration officials to include another Republican member of the commission, Kevin Martin; Becky Klein, a former head of the public utility commission in Texas; Patrick Wood III, the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and Michael Gallagher, head of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in the Commerce Department.""

Call me a cynic, but none of these folk strike me as being especially ""progessive."""

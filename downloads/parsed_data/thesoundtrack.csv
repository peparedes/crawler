converge and death threat still need masters made so those might take a little bit longer than other stuff on the list. i have a ton local bands if any of those bands want those dubs. [the fullblast, seconds to go, cursed, BSAW, boys night out, just ask me about anything else]

each show is 10$ 
you can put up to 2hours on a vhs and i'll cut you a deal
dvds only one show per dvd 10$ as well.
i might make excepts for certain shows but its a real hassle if you wanna offer up more bling i can fit 2 hours on a dvd."

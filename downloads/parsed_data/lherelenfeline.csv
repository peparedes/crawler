"event","I&#39;d been having really unpleasant digestive symptoms for the past 6 months. Summarized without too much detail, it&#39;s been half a year of nearly non stop diarrhea/ loose stool. It&#39;s not resposive tochages in diet, or over the counter medication. The only reason I&#39;ve been able to function at all, is a prescription strength anti-diarrheal pill. My PCP ran tests for parasites and bacterial infections, which turned up negative. So I finally went to a specialist who recommeded a colonoscopy. Which was yesterday.

The good news is that the pictures didn&#39;t show anything awful, which is also the bad news because I am now going to have to deal with more tests. That said, I did learn something pretty interesting about myself. 
When I was diagnosed with ADHD five years ago, I went though a bunch of different mediactions to see what would work to manage my symptoms. I tried everythign from Ritalin to the fancy non-stimulant types, and the only thing that would work was generaic ass Adderal IR (immediate release).

Back then, my provider told me that my brain chemistry could possibly settle down in a few years and I could go on the extended release version of the medication. This would of course be very welcome because frankly, I&#39;d rather take 1 pill, once a day, instead of .5 of a pill, 3x a day. Well, with the colonoscopy happening, I tried Adderall XR, and let me tell you it&#39;s still the same. I&#39;ve been unable to concentrate, jittery as hell and crving nicotine for the first time in a year. It&#39;s having the exact opposite effect of what the immediate release version does. It&#39;s taken me nearly 2 hours to get this entry drafted up, which is a pretty clear illustration that the XR aint working.

So, while my guts are in full rebellion stiil, at leats my brain chemistry has settled into a reliably stable state?
Yay me.

Oh, and I&#39;ve starte dmy own practice, but that&#39;s a different story for a different day."

The reality however is that I will vote for whoever ends up getting the nomination, even though I really would rather it not be Clinton, because as a queer person of color I have no choice.

The GOP considers me less than, would strip me of legal protections up to and including the ability to use a public loo.

<li>The Hammonds, the Oregon ranchers whose supposedly unjust setntece for multiple acts of arson and poaching is beging used as a pretext for the Bundys&#39; war games don&#39;t want them there. neither do the rest of the locals.</li>
<li>The Hammonds got the mandatory minimum for what they did and the feds let them serve the 5 year terms concurrently. Pretty dam generous for numerous acts of arson and poaching. They have reported to prison and are notinvolved in the shitshow.</li>
<li>This whole thing can be described as &quot;When mandatory minimums affect entitled white people.&quot; Where the fuck were all these people decrying the injustice of mandatory minimums when the people suffering under them were perceived as all poor ghetto black people? The 9th Circuit opinion upholding the Hammonds&#39; sentences is a freaking walk through the hair raising injustices wrought by the mandatory minimum system as it exists now.

And then there&#39;s Pennsic.
Pennsic is home. It&#39;s 2 weeks of joy and recharging amongst people I consider more or less family. I haven&#39;t been able to afford to go since 2011. In 2012 R was in school and there was no money for me to go. In 2013 I was sitting the bar exam, and there was no money for me to go because R was in school and I was looking for work. In 2014 I had just started a job, and R was in school full time so we couldn&#39;t afford it. This year, R is taking an 8 week intensive at Middlebury at the cost of 10K, and we are saving for the wedding, so again, there&#39;s no money.

At this point, I&#39;m starting to think it will never happen. And that hurts.

I get that R wants a proper wedding, with a reception and family and all that. I would be perfectly happy with an elopment.
But really, I just want to go home for 2 weeks."

"event","Dill is gone.
He passed at around sunrise on Wednesday. 
Our sweet boy hung on until we went to sleep at around 2 in the morning, and I found his body about a foot away from our bed and I got up at 6.
He was still warm. His body was normal temperature and pliable, but he was clearly not breathing.

We are both devastated.
When I was writing my previous entry, he was saying his goodbyes.

 After he came back from the vet on Monday, Dill spent time in all of his favorite spots. He was starting to refuse food, and growing weaker, but he found the strength to growl at Fuzz for getting handsy, to eat some of his fvorite junk food treats and to cuddle with us and purr. 

He gave Rodger one last night of falling asleep cuddled up with Dill under the cover. We both got our beard groomed one last time. I got to bury my nose in his fur and breathe the corn chip smell of him while he purred with all of his strenth. Dill had the deepest, loudest purr of any cat I've ever known. He purred so deep, and so loud that he vibrated with it.

On Tuesday he couldn't purr anymore. He had no strength to eat, or to lift his head for a drink of water. It was the end, we knew, and we scheduled a vet to come to our place on Wednesday evening to ease him over the Rainbow Bridge.

And as usual, Dill beat us to the punch. He was always getting off our laps just a split second before we were ready to let him off. He spared us the euthanasia process, but we weren't ready. I don't think we ever could have been. He was only 5."

We had to take him back to the vet this morning, because there was fluid in his chest again. 
That visit took up a large portion of our food budget for the month.
Our vet believes that the cause is either an extreme deterioration of his heart, or Lymphoma. At this point the focus is on palliative care, and being able to afford to euthanize him at home.


His bills have come up to over $3K, and there is likely more coming. We have maxed out the credit that is available to us, and we need help.

I personally feel like a failure for having to ask for financial help, but my partner has put together a Go Fund me page for him.

Please help if you can.

 Xmas was fab, with the exception of flu getting. And we got a potted xmas tree, so it can grow with us. 

Now I'm in bed with an electric blanket and a cat, while R cooks."

Its a unique, handmade mugI got at Pennsic the other summer.
There is no way to &quot;mistake it&quot; for a common mug.
And nobody is owning up to it.

I am pissed.

Plus I&#39;m grumpy because R is sick and kept me up mist of the night with his cough.
3 hours of sleep + stolen mug = vey pissy Ksen."

"event","This is what failure of our healthcare system looks like.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been able to go into hock to cover my teefs. This person doesn&#39;t even have that option.<br /><br /><br />Originally posted by <lj user=""editrx"" /> at <a href=""http://editrx.livejournal.com/259783.html"">The post I dread to make</a><div class=""repost""><i>(ETA: I have added jewelry to be &quot;bartered&quot; for donations at <a href=""http://editrx.livejournal.com/259940.html"">this</a> post. I will be amending that post as I get more jewelry made. Keep an eye on it, please, or just check my LJ every now and then, if you could be so kind.)</i><br /><br />------------------<br /><br />No, nobody died.<br /><br />Now that that&#39;s out of the way, here&#39;s where I make the post I&#39;ve dreaded to make. But I have to make it. I have to ask. If I don&#39;t ask (and people do or <i>don&#39;t</i> respond), then I can&#39;t say I didn&#39;t try. Right?<br /><br /><b><i>I have a medical emergency.</i></b><br /><br />It&#39;s not a pretty one. It&#39;s not even exotic. It&#39;s not a cute disease or something I&#39;m in the ICU for (yet).<br /><br />I have a tooth that&#39;s abscessed. Badly. And another that&#39;s cracked and also needs repair (and is possibly dying, too).<br /><br />The abscessed one and the one that&#39;s cracked are upper molars that I <i>knew</i> were problems, but we started the moving process, I ignored them as best I could (I slept badly these last 3 months, sucking on my teeth as I slept, and eating soft food during days) and figured when the move was done I could find a local dentist to pick up where my old one left off -- and get these suckers drilled and new fillings put in.<br /><br />But they cracked. And the one is abscessing now (my face is swollen, painful, hot, and yes, it&#39;s going up the head and down the neck -- and YES, I&#39;m on antibiotics and am scheduled to go for the root canal on Thursday, unless it gets even worse before then). The other cracked and clearly also needs a cap but also probably a root canal (they&#39;ll only know when they look closer on Thursday).<br /><br />I have no dental insurance.<br /><br />Because of the emergency nature of the abscessed tooth (root canal, temporary cap, then permanent cap, plus further close exam of the adjoining molar to determine if it just needs a cap or a root canal too), I&#39;m looking at about <b>$4,000 total for these two teeth alone</b>.<br /><br /><b>$4000 -- and the dentist requires (as I have no insurance) payment at the time of the treatment, or they won&#39;t do it. That&#39;s Thursday -- day after tomorrow.</b><br /><br />We have $1000 in the bank total, no major payments coming in from clients in the near future (NOTE TO AUTHORS: Yes, thanks for recommending us for copyediting when you can, to your publishers, but bear in mind that a single copyedit of a single book pays as much as $300. That&#39;s it. It sucks, it does. But it&#39;s the nature of the beast.) We have outstanding bills for electricity, gas, Internet -- and that&#39;s just for the new house. We&#39;re delinquent on all the bills for the old house, and the bank has started foreclosure on it, which means if it sells, we&#39;ll never see a penny. They may shut off all the utilities here, too -- we can&#39;t pay the bills as it is.<br /><br />So here I am, hat in hand.<br /><br />This will break us if I don&#39;t get some help.<br /><br />What I can do in return for any donations:<br /><br /><ul><li><i>Make you bespoke jewelry</i>: I work in sterling silver and gold, have in stock some <i>gorgeous</i> boro glass as well as semiprecious and some surprisingly beautiful glass from India, just as a few examples. Earrings, bracelets, necklaces. We can negotiate with what I have in stock here (was going to do more stuff to set up an Etsy store, but this is more important by far -- I&#39;d rather barter bespoke jewelry for the root canal...)</li><br /><li><i>Make you bespoke knitting/craft counter bracelets and/or knitting row markers</i>: examples are found <a href=""http://www.windhaven.com/bracelets"">here</a>, along with the beads I use for the counters -- I also have a more varied stock of charms than that site shows.</li><br /><li><i>Work out a barter with you as an editor, line-editor, copy editor, proofreader, or even designer/typesetter.</i> I do all of those things, and have done for over 25 years professionally for the major publishers (as well as individual authors). I can design and convert to e-books as well as work with for-print books.</li><br /><li><i>Work out a barter for my design work.</i> (See above.)</li><br /><li><i>Barter with my existing jewelry from my mother</i>: bartering with you folks is actually better than trying to sell anything for the worth of the raw gold or silver. All of this stuff has gems: diamonds, turquoise (her favorite, and there&#39;s some gorgeous stuff), rubies, you name it. My mother had an incredible collection of jewelry dating from the &#39;40s onwards. If anyone&#39;s interested in some of the pieces for a serious barter, I can photograph them.</li></ul><br /><br />There may be another barter you&#39;d like to work out -- such as a wander through my antique china collection or crystal collection (family heirlooms).<br /><br />The hat&#39;s out. I just hope some of you can help.<br /><br />Best alternative: BROADCAST THIS. Pass it along. Let people know that I&#39;ve finally hit that one medical emergency no one, no agency, no federal or state program will help me with.<br /><br />The only other option is to let the abscess run its course until I&#39;m hospitalized via the ER, and they actually remove the tooth. It&#39;s the main molar on the upper left (and it&#39;s neighbor), which would leave me with no teeth to chew against on the left side of my mouth. And did I note: I live in fear of losing my teeth -- to the point of phobia. THIS IS COMPLETELY FREAKING ME OUT. Besides, if I wait and let the abscess become that bad, there&#39;s a BIG risk of brain infection and permanent damage, as well as death.<br /><br />There has to be a better way. Help me make a better way.<br /><br /><b>Link is on my right-hand upper sidebar -- the big PAYPAL blue &amp; white button is my PayPal account. Barring that, you can Send Money via PayPal to: nhanger AT windhaven DOT com. Or write to me asking for my street address [I&#39;m a terrible person and haven&#39;t updated all that at my business domain site yet, since moving].</b><br /><br /><b>ETA: The response from you all has been amazing: donations, lots of wonderful WONDERFUL notes of kindness and love and support, sales to you all of jewelry, and requests for more jewelry, and most of all (I&#39;m repeating myself, I know), the LOVE. I&#39;m surrounded by it -- you guys are astounding. I&#39;m humbled. Thank you. Keep on boosting the signal!</b></div><br />"

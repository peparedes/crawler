"event","Haha I wish you could pick two moods at once, cause right now I'm feeling both rejected and loved. I'll just go for loved I think. : ]<br /><br />Today was great! ""Outdoor"" day with school, spending all day at a lake is always nice. I didn't expect paddling canoes to be fun, but it was awesome. REALLY tiring but awesome nevertheless. <br />I'd show pics but I'm too lazy to upload them.<br /><br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"">So Anton was being a bitch today. It was NOT my&nbsp; idea to paddle with him, the teacher&nbsp; thought it would be best since me and Emma are small and skinny and it was really windy. So he said that Martin and Anton should split up and one of them would go with me and one with Emma. SEE, NOT MY IDEA. I don't know how I ended up with him, I would much rather have gone with Martin. How can he even think about being pissy with me? Is it perhaps my fault I'm a tiny person who's never paddled canoes before? Is it my fault the teacher doesn't want me and Emma to drown?<br /><br />But whatever. I spent the day with Emma and the guys and we had a lot of fun. And then I sat with Martin on the bus home which was also great. So overall a good day. :]<br /></div><br /><br /><lj-cut></lj-cut>"

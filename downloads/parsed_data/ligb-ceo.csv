One of the most powerful Jedi of all time, you possess the best of all
worlds. Your wisdom is vast and unquestioned, and you use it for good.
You are an amazingly powerful and skilled fighter, and only use
aggressiveness for battle, and only battle when necessary. Lastly, your
sense of morality is without peer. You always do what is right, and

Saw this quiz thing somewhere, so I'm like, I'm bored I'll see which Jedi/Sith I would be.  So I'm takin' it, answerin' honestly, cuz I personally figured I'd be Luke...tempted by the Dark Side but ultimately siding with the light side of the force.  Which is cool, Luke is more than an acceptible outcome.  I can respect myself for being Luke.

And if not Luke I figure I'd be Mace, ya know, kinda showing dark side tendencies.

And then I get Yoda!  Fucking sick!

Anyways, now that i got episode 3 on DVD, i'm off to watch it, just thought I'd mention I'm yoda :-D"

"event","Haven't updated in a while, thought maybe I'd give everyone a peak into my head again...It's about time I shed a light on the dark again.

My new job is boring as hell, but its great.  I sit at a desk...a desk i don't have to share with anybody!  Yeah, well that's all on the job front.  I told you it was boring, did you think I was lying?

My car crapped out on me...AGAIN.  About $800 to fix it, I'm hoping to get it back tomorrow, after going without it for about a week.

I've been thinking about shit lately.  I'm tired.  Not like ""Oh man I need a fuckin' nap"" tired, just tired.  Tired of whats around me.  I want more than a pool hall, a movie theatre, a driving range and a bowling alley.  But what else is there?  Put shit into perspective, if I moved to fucking Italy, the first thing I'd learn how to say in Italian is ""Where's the closest pool hall, movie theatre, driving range and bowling alley?""  What can I say, I'm a simpleton.

I'm tired of being an outsider who happens to live on the inside.  I'll explain that, so that your head doesn't explode from reading that sentence.  At work, for example, everyone is like rich.  Lindenhurst/Garden City ""Hey if your not using that stick, I'd like to stick it in my ass so I stand up right at all times"" rich.  And I'm the only guy in the office.  So that means I'm sittin with what appear to be snobby girls all the time.  

<i>""I spent like $83 on a pair of shoes"" My ears perked up, because I needed to hear the next part of the sentence, ""I couldn't believe I got them for such a good price, they usually go for over $100""  I continued to listen, because surely the other conversationalist would slap that girl, something I couldn't do personally.  ""Really?"" I heard her inquire, ""I just spent about a hundred on a new bag.""

I did the math in my head twice before I opened my mouth...""Ya spen' a combined total of a hunnerd an' eighty-tree dollas on two shoes an' a pocket-book?  For dat I coulda bought a new wardrobe to las' me a yea'.""

""Did you just say 'a hunnerd and eighty-tree?'""

""You've never seen a house with bars on its windows have you?""....But when I opened my mouth it came out as ""Oh, yeah.  Heh, guess when yer whole fam'ly comes from brooklyn/queens ya pick up certain parts of the dialect by jus' bein' around 'em, ya now?  But honestly, I got 2 pairs 'a shoes.  Sneakers and funeral shoes.""</i>

Which was met by a laugh from the less rich of the group...But what does that all mean exactly?  Nothin' except that's how I feel all the time.  I just feel different.  And not always because I say ""tree"" instead of ""three"" on occation.  That's just an easy way of giving you an example.  I can't describe why I feel that way, I just sort of do.  I guess I'm just sayin fitting in more would be cool, and not just at work.  (I'll save the funny stories of work for the next entry.)

But I started to think, maybe the reason I'm still single is I'm lookin' for somebody who's just a little different.  Somebody who happens to be off the wall and not quick to judge.  Somebody like Helen was.  You probably don't know who that is.  Quick overview, went to school with her for a few semesters, she was really cool, had a boyfriend, think she's somewhere in Boston now.  Maybe ya'll wondering why if I thought she was so cool you never heard about her til now.  Short answer, I don't talk about certain things that have no reason to be brought up.  Long answer, describing why I thought she was cool would take to damn long.  Besides, she had a boyfriend, had no reason to go after her, so we were just friends.

I finally fleshed out my movie idea.  It's really good too, still needs an ending.  Endings are fucking hard.

Got an idea for a novel/short story.  It's called ""Thief""  Not sure when I'll get the chance to write it, but basically it's about a thief who lives in Vegas.  Though it's not what you think it is, and I'm undecided if casinos have anything to do with the story yet.

There's more I wanna write, but I gotta go to work, tonite I'll finish up, maybe tell one of those stories from work.  Maybe a bit more on what I've been thinking about.

"event","it's been an interesting few weeks.  i've been hurt in such a way that i couldn't actually describe it in words if i tried.

well i could do that fairly easily if i wanted to.  i could say it feels like somebody took a shotgun and shot my heart at point blank range.  i hate to sound all emo and shit, but i mean if you trust a person to be your best friend, then a certain amount of love has to be there.  i'm obviously not talkin' about ""i wanna do you on the pool table"" love, i'm talkin about that ""i want the means to destroy me to be in the hands of a person i can trust with my life"" kinda love.

but you don't expect that to be exploited.  you don't expect somebody with that kind of power to use it against you.  you can't just have that kind of power, you have to be given that kind of power.  which makes it hurt even more when it gets uses against you.  that would be like Batman teaching Dick Grayson everything he knows only for Dick to say ""by the way, I'm not gonna be Robin.  I've decided on being The Court Jester and I'm gonna hang out with The Joker and help him kill you because now I know your secrets.""

part of me knew this was coming though.  it was inevitable.  i guess these things always are.  a few months ago i would be more upset about this.  but these days i could give a rats ass about being around people or not.  i've been enjoying my solitude a lot lately.

that's not to say i don't enjoy the company of other people.  Star Wars Trivial Pursuit and Worms 3D made the past 2 nites quite fun.  And obviously to play multi-player games you need multiple people.

i now have a ""reputation"" at work.  its not much different than the one i had at Target, though I didn't know i had it at target until yesterday.  apparently i'm officially ""violent, angry, unfriendly and scary.""  we all knew that, so its no big deal.  but its like for all the times i've been in a good mood cracking jokes and enjoying myself at work i'm still the ""fucked up guy that people shy away from.""  I thought at Target i was past that.  i was there so long that even though everyone knew i was crazy, they at least saw me for being more than that.  but no, i was wrong.  i was told ""it's just not the same without you flipping out and breaking shit""

funny right?  2 years in that place and i leave behind the legacy of violence and anger.  i guess it could be worse, i could have been rememered for being a great worker...and we all know how hard i tried to NEVER work while i was there.  so yay for that...right?

but yeah, when 2 groups of people who don't ever socialize feel the same way about you...its obviously the truth.  and when people you know really well see it, then there's no arguing it.

so i could spend years...hell a lifetime...trying to figure out who i am, but i already know.  i'm the crazy son-of-a-bitch who'll just as soon kill you than tell ya the time of day.  i'm violent.  i'm angry.  i'm crazy.  i'm mean.  i'm scary.

but just once i'd like to be thought of as ""the guy who just spent all that time putting everyone ahead of him to make sure the people around him were happy.""

i've always said this and i'm saying it again.  people remember what stands out.  if 364 days a year your a great person and 1 day your angry.  they remember the angry day.

the 4-8 hours a day i'm at work, i'm pissy because BJs makes me that way.  the other 20+ hours i can be great.  but the 4-8 define me, so nobody cares about the rest of the day.

and to bring this all full circle i'll end with what brought me to writing this entry.

i was told by somebody who i loved as my best friend that i was ""too scary to be around anymore""  and i was basically told that i was like that because i was selfish.  and this was after i was flat out lied to by the same person.  and this is the person that got mad at me for not spreading the lie to benefit them....or so i was lead to believe.  and as of now, i have no reason not to believe it.  though with all my heart i'd love to be proven wrong and not have to believe it.

it takes a lot to really, truly hurt me to the point where i stop caring about the hurt and just walk away.  i've said from the beginning i can't have my feelings hurt because i've learned to ignore the few feelings i've got left.  but right about now i think i have no feelings left.  i'm just left with one burning question in my mind.

<i>why?</i>"

"event","To be completely honest, I don't even know why I'm writing this entry.  I'm not to sure people read these, and I find writing them extremely tedious.  I guess I sort of do it out of habit these days.  Oh well, whatever....

Everyone seems to be asking me the same question lately.  ""What's wrong?""  A lot of shit is fucking wrong.  Problem is, there's so much shit wrong that I can't narrow it down to the big problem.

I mean I just fucking snap at the drop of a dime these days.  I've lost all my patience for everything.  If something bothers me, everybody knows about.  It's like I don't quite care if I hurt somebody in the process or not.

And the littlest things can set me off.  One of the managers at work gave me the slightest attitude and I flipped a shit in the middle of the store.  Customers were around and everything.  Had a manager been around when I flipped I would have been fired.

And I know it was bad because the people I work with were all like ""wow, your fuckin' crazy.""  And today everyone was all like ""are you ok?  You were a bit insane last night.""

So yeah, I have these anger issues.  But the part that scares me a bit is when I'm flipping out, I feel good.  It's like I'd rather be in this mad rage than be calm.

But that's neither here nor there.

I sorta feel bad sometimes.  I mean Lisa asked what was wrong, and I sorta just jumped down her throat about it.  And she just gave me this look as if to say ""I'm disapointed.""  I dunno if that's what she wanted me to see or not, but it sure seemed that way.

And while I wanted to be like ""I can change to be happy again."" I couldn't say that.  I said ""I'd rather be angry.""  Because the truth is I'm better at being angry.

And then she asked if it was her fault...and it's not, but it got me a little bit.  People are blaming themselves for my being pissy?  What kinda shit is that?  Now I gotta feel responsible for making other people miserable.  And I know that's not what she intended for me to feel like, but I mean how else should I feel?

No, it's nobody's fault I'm the way I am.  Certain things don't help my mood, I'll admit.  And read into that as much or as little as you'd like.

I don't know a lot of stuff.  I'm admittedly not very book smart and I'm not too bright when it comes to a lot of things.  But I do know that I'm done being somebody I'm not.  I like my hat, I like my handball, I like my gloves, I like to hit things.  And yeah, I do like being funny too, I'm told I'm a funny guy.  You put all of that together, you get me.

And if people don't like that, oh well.  I can't be concerned with making everyone love me.  I'm really shocked at the amount of people I see around me who will just change like the fucking weather to impress a person.  A person you need to impress isn't worth impressing.  They should just be impressed that your being yourself.  Being yourself should be enough.

I've said it before, I'll say it again...People don't change.  We can't change ourselves because then we'd be somebody else.  All that time you spend changing to make somebody see you different fades away at the end of the night anyway.  Because when you go to sleep, the last thing you think about is something YOU want to think about.  Not what somebody else wants to think.

So it's impossible to lie to yourself about those things.  And if ya can't lie to yourself, ya shoulnd't lie to anyone else.

Well that's it for now, I've done enough whining and bitching for one night.  I just kinda hope it sheds a bit of light on things for some people, since everyone's been askin..."

"event","I expect replies.  doesn't have to be on here, but you can IM me, tell me in person or even call me.  I like IMs the best though.  this way you can't tell if i'm that mad or not.

Here's what everyone needs to understand:

she's one of my best friends and that is not changing.  Don't give me any bullshit about that.  Sure she gets mad at me sometimes, sure i get mad at her sometimes.  but ya know what, she's still my best friend.

when i'm around, don't say bad things about her.  talk nice about her.  unless of course you all like seeing me angry.  you've seen me angry, do you really want that directed towards you?

if she's around you, you don't say bad things about her.  cuz if i'm there, i'll be angrier than when you say bad things and she's not around.  and if i'm not there and i still find out, i know where all of you live.

no more saying she's gonna be the cause of any problems with any of us.  because i'll tell ya what...if it does become a problem, it won't be my fault, nor will it be her fault.  and i'm ok with saying that.  because if there hasn't been a problem yet, there is no reason for one ever.

you don't like any of that, fine.  if you all feel like i'm putting her ahead of everybody else, fine.  feel how you wanna feel.  think what you wanna think.

before you all start saying ""well everyone can say stuff about me, and we can't get mad"" or whatever, i'll tell ya this.  a lot of you guys have taken a liking to calling me stupid, and i don't say anything.  a lot of you guys chose me to be a scapegoat for problems and i don't say anything.  and go ahead and continue to do all of that, and i still won't say anything.  

but just remember, just cuz i don't go around broadcasting, i'm mentally unstable.  i just don't go to the doctor to get that fixed.  the school shrink couldn't prescribe meds and mommy and daddy didn't want to believe anything was wrong with their baby boy.  so i continue to be fucked up.  its fun really, flipping out at times because i don't like the shade of blue the sky is.  i can keep that in check though, as long as im not provoked.

i don't like fighting with my friends.  i try to avoid it at all costs.  im trying to avoid it now by saying all of this here instead of getting loud by saying it in person.  i also don't enjoy feeling like i have to choose between one friend or another.  especially in a case like this.  but they way my choice would be decided is this:  whoever doesn't make me feel like i hafta choose is who i would choose.  read into that as much or as little as you'd like.  i'm sure everyone is gonna put words in my mouth, that i never wrote down.

if you feel like saying ""fuck you, i'm playing favorites"" I'll deny that I am at all costs, but I will give you a shit load of reasons as to how i could be justified in doing so.  personally, i think i'm being fair because i'm telling everybody all of this at one time and not singling any one person out.

be angry, be pissy.  yell at me.  scream at me.  start a fight with me.  and if you don't want to talk to me anymore, let me know because  it'll save me money on christmas cards next december.

I'll start with this...I kinda sort of hurt myself today.  Not bad or nothin, but I was outside hittin' my bag and I just lost it.  I absolutely lost it.  I started throwin' wild punches as hard as I could, I was kinda sorta yellin.  And I was only using my bag gloves, so I don't have a helluva lot of support and padding on them.  So both my hands were swollen for a while both wrists are kinda sore at the moment.

The thing is I've been really good lately with my temper.  I haven't been violent or anything.  But today was just crazy.  I was fine all day up until I went outside to hit the bag and I was fine after.  But while I was hittin' it I just went crazy.

I've kinda sorta been hearin' lots of things that don't make me feel to nice inside lately.  Not like I'm being attacked or anything, but just enough stuff to make me think.  All sides of the fences really have strong opinions right now, but the thing is none of those opinions seem to coincide with mine.  Which is cool, everyone's got an opinion, I respect that.  And I can honestly say everybody has been sharing them with me respectfully, so I'm not mad.  I can't explain it, I just feel like I'm fightin' an uphill battle.  (did i butcher that badly?  Uphill battle, does that make sense?)

I've been bitten by the ""being single sucks"" bug again.  Happens every now and then.  I can deal with being single, I don't mind it.  It's not like its the worst thing in the world.  But sometimes I think it would be nice to be able to talk to somebody about things that I really wouldn't feel right talkin' to everyone else about.  I dunno, some things you can't share with the guys, but its like there's no where else to go.  And hell I can't say it wouldn't feel nice to actually be wanted for a change.  But whatever, I'll deal with it.  Like I said, not the worst thing in the world, just been on my mind lately.

This whole construction thing is killing me.  I'm up early everyday so they can work without me being in the way.  They're puttin the roof on now so I all I hear is banging.  It's just aggrivating.  I can't sleep as it is because of my insomnia, they don't help.

Work sucks.  I hate work.  I wish I didn't have to work.

You ever see a movie or hear a song or read a book and it just captures everything your feeling?  Isn't that uncanny?  At some point somebody must have been going through something nearly identical to what your going through....and they managed to cash in on it too.  But I was just listenin to the radio before and a lot of songs really just clicked with me because of the words.  Not even that I liked the song, but the words hit home.

There are a lot of people in the world, and I find that many of them suck.  But I find that many more of them think I suck.

Sometimes I sorta feel like I'm kinda pointless.  Like what do I really do?  I sort of question why I'm here, and people are always like ""that's normal"" but I can't even think of 1/4 of a reason as to why I'm still around.

This is sort of seeming like a whiney, my life sucks, woe is me entry, and it really wasn't supposed to.  I was just tryin' to kill sometime and maybe even clear my head a bit.  But when I stop and realize that people read these things I start to think that people must think I'm a bitch sometimes.  That's why I'm always tryign to be vague.  Maybe it won't sound like i'm bitching so much if you can't tell what I'm talking about.

Remember back when I used to say I'm fearless?  Part of that's still true.  I really don't get afraid, and when I do I can overcome the fear easily.  But now I know why.  It's not because I'm just Mr. No-Fear or because I'm too scool to be scared.  It's because if I'm not afraid of what's gonna happen I can do stupid things which can in turn potentially cause me some kind of harm.  And maybe I secretly want that.

I have so much more I want to say, but I'm just not saying it.  I dunno, I sort of feel like nobody even gives a shit, so why bother putting it where people can see it.  And I already know everything, so I don't hafta write it down for myself.

Have you ever tried to retrace your steps to find out what one thing could have changed everything.  Was it the first punch you threw?  First time cheating on a test?  First detention?  Something even bigger?  Maybe something smaller?  Was it more than just one thing?

OK, that's it for this entry.  If you've read the whole thing you deserve a cookie or something because it was pretty friggin long."

"event","I don't know much about a lot of things, everybody knows that.  I'm not a Mr. Know-It-All for the reason of I freely admit I don't know shit.

Give me a book, I'll read it and I'll remember what it says because I've got a good memory.  But understanding it, that's a completely different beast.

I know that 2 + 2 = 4.  But I don't understand why.  To me it only equals four because that's what I've always been told.

HOWEVER, I am ready to entertain the notion that 2 + 2 = 6.  Because if I never understood why it was 4, there's no reason it can't be 6.

If you've hung out with me, or even just talked to me, you know that I say a lot of stupid shit, and we all laugh about it.  No big deal, I say dumb things because I'm essentially a dumb guy with a few skills.

So I know that I may be wrong about a lot of stuff.

But without strokin' my own dick I can say I have a damn good sense of right and wrong.  Because that much is very true.  Because I know when something is just plain bad.  You can't justify killing a person because they had freckles and you don't like freckles.  But you can justify beating the shit out of the guy who killed the person with the freckles.


I think a lot times people mistake one feeling for another.  Hurt is confused with anger, anger confused with love, love confused with hate, hate confused with sorrow...and so on and so forth.  And I think that's because people want to see people in a certain way.

For instance you may want to think a person is good friend with you, so you confuse there insults as jokes.  But really they just want to make you feel bad.

Or you may want to think a person is totally mad at you, but in reality they're just kinda hurt about what was said.

But we see what we want to see, whether its there or not.  And that's where knowing the difference between right and wrong comes in to play.  If you the difference between right and wrong then you know when somebody is either A) Not being honest with you or B) Acting a certain way for a certain reason

And technically its best to just avoid those people.  Less aggrivation, less heart ache.  But also you don't build any character.  We are who we are because of what we've been through and what's always been around us.

And we can't change who we are.  But that doesn't mean everyone will accept your differences.  Because if that was the case we wouldn't have wars and the world would be a whole instead of a lot of little pieces.

And I know its like I'm beatin' a dead horse, but I honestly and truly just can't tolerate that kind of shit.  Because I used to be the asshole that would be like ""i'm not talking to you cuz you dress funny""  And why was I like that?  Because people used to do it to me all the time.  And then one day I said ""wait, I don't like it, so I'm not gonna do it.""  I mean that's exactly how it happened.  So I apologized to certain people, and I turned over that new leaf.

Because even though people did say shit about my weight or whatever else they had to say, I was comfortable with who I was.  And that was all the mattered.

But what really pissed me off was when I lost all the weight that I lost, people just moved on to the next fat kid in the class.  And suddenly I was an OK guy.  But what the fuck?  I was used to it, everything people said, the new fat kid wasn't.  So why not just keep picking on me for something different.  Leave everyone else out of it.

Which then caused me to flip out on the assholes, and they were like ""yeah that's cool""  Like I fit in better because I flipped out.  I couldn't win.  Because suddenly I was less different.

Thing is I still was different.  Because I still dressed differently, talked differently.  But it really didn't matter because I was close enough to the norm.

And I knew that was very wrong.  And now I talk to like 5 people from my HS because nobody else is worth it.

And now we get back to my original point of me being dumb.  Yeah I'm a dumb kinda guy because I thought things outside of HS were different.  But the truth is, its the same shit.  People still don't care about anybody but themselves, and as soon as you get upset because of hurtful words you become the bad guy.  Because obviously it's every human's god given right to dislike people because of a hat and a jacket.  And I suck because I'm denying that right.

I'm not the best guy in the world, I never would make such a claim.  But I know that I ain't a bad guy either.

And I know I'm not changing who I am so that other people will like me.  But I will hold out and hope that someday it won't matter that I'm different.  Because really, that's all that I want.  I want to not be judged based on my outside.

Sorry for the long ass rant, if you've read all of it you must be really bored, but I hope it made you think a little bit.  So that the next time you see that kid with freckles you won't kill them, but you'll see if maybe they want to grab a cup of coffee or a bite to eat."

"event","First off people don't like who I am or how I dress or how I talk or what I do and I don't give a fuck.

The fake Italian accent, the leather jacket, the leather gloves, the silver chain...yeah I've had those for years.

In HS me and my friend Karcher would sit in front of the school singin the ""Take It Back"" song.  Everybody in my HS saw me and called me PJD with that mafia-esque accent.  In fact when I run into them now they still do.

I've always liked Rocky.  Its one of the few things me and my brother have in common.  It ain't a big secret that me and him fight all the damn time.  We have nothing in common.  But we both watch those movies, we both watch The Contender, we both play the Rocky video game and we don't fight for a while.  I don't have a close knit family, even though my parents like to think we do.  I kinda like the idea of not hating my brother all the time, so sue me if we watch a movie a lot.

We used to have a punching bag in my house, it broke so we bought a new one.

I've quoted lines from movies and TV shows since forever.  Because my biggest hobbies are movies, TV and comics.  Is it strange that I quote my favorite movies more than others?

This is who I've always been, it's who I'm always going to be.  I don't need people to like me for it.

The reason I'm wearing my chain again is I don't work in the backroom of Target anymore.  I don't have to worry about breaking it.  The reason for the new leather gloves with the cut off fingers is I lost my old ones that weren't fingerless, I had these in my house and I didn't feel like buying new gloves.  I've always worn different types of hat.  Bucket hats, knit hats, baseball caps, kangols and now a fedora.  But next time ya want to write tht off as me wanting to be Rocky, why don't ya ask, because your wrong.  My grandfather used to wear fedoras all the time.  Its no big secret how close I was with my grandpa.  I spent more time with him than my parents.  I love being compared to my grandfather, so I act like him.  Oh btw, my grandfather used to be a boxer in the army and he was a ref also.  And he was a cook and a baker.  Ever wonder why I was so happy in the bakery when I first got there?

In fact he's the reason I even like boxing.  And when we were kids he used to call me the Champ of the Champions, but with his accent its sounded like ""Champeens.""  Which was the same way Mickey talked in the Rocky movies, which makes me think of my grandpa, which puts me in a better mood.

So go ahead get aggrivated at me for acting the way I've always been.  Because the PJ that everyone used to know was fake.  I acted that way because people wanted me to act a certain way.  And that's fucked up because I've never made anybody act any special way.  I know I'm a bit odd, like I don't quite belong where I live, like I should maybe have been born a few years early and maybe lived to the east a few mile overs.  I try so hard to be accepting of everybody's differences.  I don't mind hanging out with people who are different than me.  But me....everyone has a problem with.  Well maybe not everyone.

I would do anything for anybody, but its like only one or two people give a fuck about me.  

All this time I thought I knew what was going on around me, but I didn't.  The people around me did and I didn't listen.  And I'm still not gonna listen just yet.  Because if I listen then I'll never know the truth.

And I'm gonna end this journal like this...Here's your challenge: if you don't hate me after reading this, call me or IM me.  And tell me what's bothering you.  Tell me what I've done, tell me what else has happened.  And then I'll tell you whats been bothering me and everything else and perhaps after that we can go back to being friends, the way we used to be.  Or don't call or IM me, and see what happens from there.

(oh and BTW, not everybody has to call or IM me, though if I've done something to bother you by all means go ahead.  I'm not hard to approach about these things.  This is aimed towards one person in specific who I'd like to hear from, but I'd like to hear from anybody who has something they need to get off their chests.)"

"event","You can please none of the people all of the time.  Yeah, I changed the saying.  Cuz there's no fucking pleasing anybody.

You're damned if you do and damned if you don't.  Saying what people want hear makes them aggrivated because your not being honest and saying the truth pisses people off because they don't wanna hear it.

Well fuck that, I'm done.  I'm not making an effort anymore.  I'll make an effort the the people who make an effort for me.  I know Alex is gonna make that effort.  Fuck, who am I kidding, he's gonna be the first person to either call me or IM me after he reads this.

Other than that, I couldn't predict anything anymore.  I could guess, and I could guess fairly well too, but I'm not guessing in public.  I mentioned Alex because he's my best friend and I know 100% that he's gonna ask what's wrong, I could be wrong on the others.

I mean I honestly don't know what the hell people want anymore.  I know the people who are looking out for me, for my best interests.  I know the people who don't wanna see me get hurt.  And I appreciate all of you wanting to see me OK.  If you wanna know if you're one of those people, ask and I'll tell ya.  But after the past few weeks, hell months, you should already know.

But other than those select few people, I don't know shit anymore.

If I've said once, I've said a billion times, I'm a dumb guy.  I'm not stupid, I'm actually fairly smart.  But I'm dumb.  I'll do whatever people tell me because at least I know that way I'm helping somebody in some way.  But by doing that people have an easy time walking all over me.  Whatever, I don't care.  I can deal with it because I'm dumb and I never realize what's happening.  I hit things a lot and I hurt myself because I'm dumb.  I lose my temper and yell at people who I shouldn't yell at because I'm dumb.

But I ain't stupid. And I don't like being treated stupid.  Spell things out for me because I need that.  And tell me what time it is because I can't read a non-digital clock.  But don't treat me like a fucking asshole.

Cuz ya know after a while it gets irritating to forgive and forget because who forgives and forgets when I have a shit day?  Nobody, that's who.  because why am I havin' a bad day?  My life's perfect.  I get along great with my family.  And I love having everyone's shit in my room and being forced to stay in my kitchen while I'm home because everyone else is using my room.  And I love my dead-end fucking job.  I love all that, so why should I have a bad fucking day, and why should people forgive me for it?

And ya know what, every fucking person I know is gonna be all ""oh, are you ok?"" and ""I'm here for ya"" and ""Everything'll be fine in end"" because now my bad fucking mood and all my shit is out in the open.  So now the people who don't care get to act like they care.  And they leave nice comments and everybody says ""Oh look how fucking nice they care, look how concerned his friends are"" and everyone smells like roses and you can all sleep with yourselves at night, right?  Well whoopty-fucking-doo.

And now everybody is gonna be all mad because ""He's taking his anger out on us"" right?  Because what did everyone do to make me so pissed off?  And then everyone stops talking to me and waits for me to apologize and fucking crawl back into my hole and pretend everything is fine.  Well not this time.  You wanna get pissed at my bad mood, be my guest.  You don't wanna talk to me anymore, I guess that's one less person I see on the fucking weekend.

I spent 19 years and 4 months caring about how everyone else felt and I spent all of 10 minutes writing this journal to express how I felt.  Because I'm a selfish fuck who only thinks about himself.  God damn, devoting 10 minutes to myself, I should be fucking shot for being so fucking shallow.

And now I'm the bad guy again because now I'm trying to make people feel guilty and I want everyone's pity.  Well I don't want you to feel bad and I don't need your pity.  I don't need anything.  I never needed anything.  I've never even asked for anything.

It's just I can't very well wear this happy face anymore.  Cuz it's a fucking lie that I don't wanna live.  Why should I not be miserable?  Why should I pretend everthing is fine if nothing is fine?  Nobody else does.  Other people get pissed and the world knows about it.  So I'm sharing with the world everything the world shared with me.

I guess there's nothing left to say.  I figure I've already alienated myself from the rest of the world, what else is there to do.

So to whoever is now gonna stop talking to me, goodbye.  Maybe I'll see ya 'round maybe I won't.  To those who are gonna pretend to care but really don't, don't bother because I don't need your fake concern.  To those who genuinely care that something is wrong do everyone a favor and don't air it all here on a comment unless you don't know how else to find me.

And to all those who just read everything because they were bored, I hope my shitty life entertained you.  'Cause all I'm fucking good for is a laugh anyway."

Nothin's wrong.

See, thing is people think I got this problem because I feel a certain way.  It ain't a problem.  See if it was a problem I really wouldn't feel that way.  i ain't in what you would call a bad situation.  my situation is fine.

I know everybody means well but the truth is nobody is gonna change what's in my head.  truth is I don't want nobody to.

I mean lemme put it like this, most times when everybody finds the girl that they wanna be around a lot, they never even see her more than 10-15 minutes a week and thats if they see her at all.  cause life is filled with shit like that.  somethin' makes ya a bit happy, so you don't get it.  but i ain't arguin' or complainin' see cuz when i met this particular girl, i was like ""i ain't never gonna see this girl outside of work, so i ain't gonna think twice about her.""  But what happened was she became my best friend.

so why would i not be happy?  that's what people don't seem to get.  everyone says ""why?  you're gettin' nothin out of it""  blah blah blah...but the thing is they don't know.  like i said, she's my best friend.  Alex is my best friend too, but nobody ever says ""your gettin nothin out of it"" cause he's a guy.

so there it is ya know.  that's been on my head lately.  well i mean she's always in my head, i won't lie.  not too many people are anything like her.  cuz the difference between her and every other girl is, as far as i can tell, she's herself.  when i look at her, i see her.  i don't see the same things i see on TV that everyone wants to emulate.  not to mention she ain't a stick in the mud.  lotta people they don't do anything, but her...she goes out ya know, and has a good time.  guess the word is ""outgoing.""  its good.

i guess what i'm sayin' is i'm lucky that she's my friend.  i'm lucky that she doesn't hate me.  i'm lucky she realizes i'm alive.  And I know my name is only 2 letters, but I'm lucky she knows those 2 letters.

So I don't need to hear I'm gettin nothin out being her friend.  i don't need to hear i'm wastin' my time.  neither is true.

see and i know there's a good chance she's gonna read this, and i hope she don't get mad or read into it the wrong way.  i mean i normally don't say any of these things where I know she's gonna hear it or see it because i know she don't want hear those things.  so hey, im sorry if it bothers ya, but at least feel better knowin' I'm not sayin' anythin bad about ya.  it's just a lotta people been sayin' stuff to me lately and i figure if all those people read my journal they all get an explanation at once.

First, I'm not stupid.  I hate that it seems like I'm stupid.  But I'm not.  I know I'm not the most book smart guy in the world.  I'm a C student at best.  But being able to quote a book doesn't make you smart.  Anybody can tell you what page 56 of a text books says if they read the text book enough.  I'm not stupid because what I do manage to maintain I can apply to life.  So maybe I think a bit more with my heart than my head but I can use my head to tell me when my heart needs to be ignored.  And I'd rather do the right thing because it's the right thing not because its been said its the right thing.  And if your head is telling you something is right but your heart's not in it, then it isn't right.  you hafta believe in what your doing.  I'm not stupid, I just believe in what I'm doing.

Second, I don't like being questioned.  'Least not on certain things.  Feel free to tell me how you feel about what I'm doing.  I'm cool with that.  I appreciate that.  It helps see things from another perspective.  Just let me answer you back with why I'm doing what I'm doing.  And then it's cool.  Nobody is really guilty of doing that, I'm not accusing anyone.  I'm just sayin' in general that I don't like that.

Third, my mind isn't always wandering.  I haven't lost my mind.  I know exactly where it is.  I got the same thoughts and ideas in my head all of the time.  I'm not zoning out all the time like it looks, I'm thinking about the same shit I always think about.  Ha-Ha, here's where the ""me not gettin personal"" shit comes into play.  I'm not saying what I'm thinking about :-p

And finally I'm just aggrivated.  There's so much stuff I should have done differently.  Things that would put me in a better place than I'm in now.  But I never did any of that stuff.

I'm not depressed.  I'm not sad.  I'm not even angry.  I've been better, but I'm not bad.  And in a few days I'll be fine again, once I get my thoughts back in order."

"event","I'm done with livejournals.  If I put stuff on here, people will read it and I don't want them to read it with their thoughts because I have different ones.  I don't want people to think for me because I didn't spell out every little thing in the entry.

so I'm done.  If you want to know what I'm thinking or feeling, just ask.  I'll most likely not have a problem telling you.  But I'm not going to just put everything out in the open anymore.

You can check here if you want.  I may use it for other purposes.  Maybe write a funny anecdote, or recap a really good day or something.  Or complain about non-essential things like school or work.

But as for personal feelings, no.  I'm not saying what I'm thinking or what I feel.  Then nothing gets twisted or misinterpreted.

"event","Hmm.. So yesterday I found out my ex (well not my last one, but the one before that) has a girlfriend. I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach and it really actually surprised me that I cared. I thought I was already completely over it. I guess not... Oh well anyways, all I need to do is find something that will distract me from it for a while. 

On a happier note, I've been in a much better mood lately. Of course, life for the most part still sucks but I guess I'm learning to either ignore it or turn it into something better. Like I'm going to have to be a hermit for the rest of my stay here in Houston, but oh well I guess this means I'll have more time to develop some super skillllzz. 

Eh, so i was thinking... and makeup really sucks. I mean except for an eyelash curler and Burt's Bees... What more do you really need?

Well I have HOMEWORK to do now since we in fact are NOT going on retreat tomorrow and it's postponed to Valentines Day. Big freaking whoop. Oh well gotta go

Balloon Ascension Day will come again I suppose."

"event","I really want to come back to Texas. I'm kind of tired of Arkansas. I mean I love being with my dad, don't get me wrong... It's just that lately when I'm around him he kinda just makes me feel like a failure. Not purposely of course its just that he's always talking about what a good, smart girl i USED to be. Always talking about how he misses the days when I was a nerd. Well, I mean its not like I'm Miss Popularity now so I really don't see what he's talking about but anyways...

All this talk from my dad about how I could be doing much better and stuff really fucking depresses me. It makes me feel like I can't do anything right. I have been pretty much slacking off at school or whatever but ugh I don't know I've just lost all my creativity, inspiration, drive, my will to do much of anything. I don't really know why but hell its a new year thats coming so maybe shit will get better. 

I feel really selfish for wanting to finish out my junior year in Texas. But I mean moving to a different STATE and going to a brand new HIGH SCHOOL in the MIDDLE OF THE YEAR? Oh God... I remember the beginning of freshman year was the worst. But truthfully maybe the worst is over. This year has been the most difficult I've ever had. My parents got separated, my dad moves to a different state, I break up with my boyfriend of a year, my BEST FRIEND moves to a different state, I have a HUGE argument with my brother and I felt scared to live in my house for a while because of it... I'm just glad to know its over. 

I'm so tired. I'm just so tired of everything. Tired of trying. If I could I would just leave for a week. Just take a week long vacation from everything that makes me feel bad. Go to a beach or a cabin or something just get up and go. I'm not into suicide and self-mutilation and stuff like that. I can deal with my shit. I'm not a coward I don't just give up. I've heard ""Oh well fine I'll just go kill myself"" so many times from so many different people that I'm SICK of it. 

I've decided I'm taking up dancing again. Ballet I think... and bellydancing if I can. Although tap is pretty fun... Hmm I don't know. I'm gonna start writing again and I'm gonna read a hell of a lot more books that I have this year. I love books I just get lost in them. When I want to just tune the world out, I read. It's so blissful. I don't care if its fucking dorky WHATEVER. I want to travel. I have a Footprints: Guide to Spain. I've already started picking out where I wanna go haha and I know where I wanna go in Italy... Just need to find places in the UK, in France and of course Morocco.

Wellll this entry has been sufficiently depressing so I'll come back sometime next month.. hopefully I'll have happier things to write about."

"event","This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach


Yours is the first face that I saw
Think I was blind before I met you
Don't know where I am, don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go


So I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realized how I need you and I wondered if I could come home 


I remember the time you drove all night 
Just to meet me in the morning 
I thought it was strange, you said everything changed 
You felt as if you'd just woke up 


And you said, ""This is the first day of my life.
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you.
Now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you,
And I'd probably be happy.""


So if you want to be with me 
With these things there's no telling 
We'll just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck than waiting to win the lottery 
Besides, maybe this time its different, I mean I really think you like me

Everytime I watch the video I want to cry. ""I love her."" Ah. Man. Anyway, I am about to get on a plane to go to Oklahoma.. I think?? Yeah random I know but my dad is impulsive like that. He still really wants to move. I'm still not sure about moving. I mean, there's nothing really here that makes me want to stay except for you and there's only a possibility that we will end up together again because its going to take a long time and I hate my brother and he hates me and my mom just doesn't care anymore. All she cares about is getting my dad back and so she uses me to do that. I don't know. I guess I'll just see how school goes for a while. Ah I hate waiting for people to call. You should've just told me you were busy. I had to go to Barnes and Noble to get a book and I even brought my flashcards with me in case you called but you didn't.. and I'm pretty sure the mentor meeting didn't last until 10 at night. But anyway, whatever it's not like you have to call me back anymore. I mean it was for you anyway, I found the flashcards I needed I just called you cause I found more info. But whatever, that was yesterday. I'm nervous about school. God... this year is going to be difficult. I'll get through. I only have one friend who I know will not leave me no matter what and thats Gillian. Cause I would never leave her either. She's really nice. I like her a lot. I love her. I think its kinda 3rd grade to say (but not like that) but I'll say it anyway just so you don't get the wrong idea: I love her (but not like that). I don't even think you're going to read this anymore so I guess its kinda pointless since you're the only one who knows it exists... but my dad isn't here yet and I have nothing else to do. so... yeah. I got a 96 on my English final. I found out yesterday. I was pretty shocked. Oh and I saw Mrs. Kramer when I went into Mrs. Larsen's (cause Eugie was trying to get some classes changed) and Mrs. Kramer was like Oh Stephanie are you dropping AP too? and I was like yeah Im going into regular and she freaked she was like OH MY GOD. TELL ME YOURE JOKING and i was like yeah i am and she was like Oh you almost gave me a heart attack. You're one of the best writers I've had and I was like Oh well what about Miss Sarah Baker? and she was like I said you were ONE of the best, not THE best. and i was like FJDLKAJFLJF.!!! I want to be THE best. I just love English too much. Okay this is getting nerd-tastic. I'm going to go now even though I'm scared shitless about getting on that plane especially since they found like 10 planes that had possible terrorists on them recently. I'm excited. You can't bring liquids or gel on the plane anymore cause they were bringing stuff to build bombs in the bottles. Well the flight to Oklahoma is only an hour and a half so I figure, I'll be just fine. I hope. It's the airport part that I'm scared about. Ah. Oh well. 

I love you. Whoever reads this shit. I love you."

"event","So. I've been thinking... Thinking is all you do when you haven't slept a full 8 hours in a God knows how long. And... I am not sorry I had all these incredibly awkward moments over the past years. Trust me, I've had a shitload. I hate the feeling when you wish you could say just one last thing to someone just to settle something or to explain why you acted that way but... you can't cause too much time has passed and it just wouldn't make sense anymore. I always want to have the last word."

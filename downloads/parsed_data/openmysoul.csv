But on May 25, 2004, at 5:27 PM, Darian Harper Nixon was born. He weighed 8 pounds 0 ounces, and was 21 inches long. He's a very happy, very healthy little boy. ^.^

My hubby and I are staying at my mother's house until we can get our own apartment (which should be pretty soon), which is just as well, because little Darian can be a handful when he's actually awake.

Breastfeeding isn't going as smoothly as we would like for it to, so we had to give him some formula this morning to calm him down. But we're still going to work on it until we know for sure whether or not we should just switch souly to formula. My milk still hasn't come in yet, but what I do have, I don't think Darian's getting enough of, since I don't think he's been swallowing anything.

As soon as his pictures show up on the MMCS Web Nursery, I'll give a link for pictures. I don't have any on the pc right now. Sorry...

Well, I'll be going for now. It's hard for me to be sitting here right now. After I recover fully, I'll come back and let everyone know how things went in delivery and update on how things are with our little boy. 

Until next time, bye!"

"event","I have come to this conclusion: all felines are completely and utterly insane...

Rascal (my mother's cat) has just spent the last ten minutes sitting two feet away from his food dish, staring instensely at it, then finally got up and started eating!

Over at Alex's, Salem (his familiar) has decided he enjoys playing chase, as well as hide-and-seek. Oddly enough, whichever human he manages to sucker into playing with him is always ""it"". He's always the one running or hiding. It doesn't mean he always wins though! *winks*

He's realized I'm pregnant, and am having more difficulting getting around the bigger my belly gets. So whenever he's wanting me to play, he runs a lot slower, or hides higher up so I can actually catch him. Isn't that sweet?

Alex and I got married on February 4th, but we're still not living permanently together yet. I spent the last week and a half over at his family's house. The only objection I have to doing so is his mom and step-dad smoke, which makes me sick to my stomach (I'm allergic to the stuff as it is). But luckily, we got to spend the weekend without them, but on Candlemas (and Valintine's Day; same day, though), Jay was over. And spent the night. That kinda ruined it for me, as he didn't go home until fairly late Sunday night, so I didn't get to spend hardly any time truly alone with my husband. Dammit...

And with Alex's middle brother being there this weekend, it's going to be at least Monday before I even get to see my husband again... Why is it I seem to get punished and stuck here whenever Jake comes home from his dad's house for the weekend? It's not fair.

My mother's car is dead. They were supposed to have called a tow truck by now and have it towed to the shop. I don't know if they did or not, as the car died on me over at Alex's house. And since I have no way of going anywhere, I'm stuck here. I can't handle walking along side the road to Alex's house, and then there's no guarentee someone can (or will) bring me back. So I would just have to walk all the way back here... Damn, I need my own car...

We still haven't had any luck on finding Alex or me a job, though now I highly doubt I can get hired anywhere, with the baby due on May 24. As it is, I'm going to have to find a way of being in the same house with Alex and a reliable vehicle for the entire months of April and May. Hopefully we can get on the waiting list, at least, for the housing authority to try to get one of these houses here in the project, as much as I hate to have to keep living here for a few more years..."

And thank the God and Goddess that it has warmed up since last night. I can actually sleep in my own bed tonight! WOOHOO! *does the dance for joy* I had such a neck cramp this morning from sleeping on the couch. Then when mom got up, I went and stole her bed (okay, so she told me I could go and get in it if I wanted to. Do you really think I was going to dismiss that offer when I've just spent the entire night sleeping bent in half? I didn't think so).

I went with Beowulf to the pharmacy to get both of our mothers' perscriptions filled. While waiting for them to be filled (the store was very busy today), we went to The Cool Store (the only metaphysical shop in this area). And I found the perfect chalice! 

It's sterling silver, with a pentagram engraved on both sides of the cup itself. And a great find at only $16. It needs polished a bit because of all the people handling it. But it's being held right now at the store, as I didn't have the money yet. Luckily, they allow Beowulf to do that. Our blessings go out to the cashiers and owners of that store for their kindness and generosity.

Well, enough talk. I need to get to work. Procrastinating again. I know...

Before I go, though... I have a request for aiding two of the women I hold dear in their times of need. Blessings, prayers, or whatever are greatly appreciated in helping these two wonderful ladies getting better.

My mother is having problems with her hypothyroid, and now her heart as well. She has developed high blood pressure, and the doctors are having trouble getting her medication right, as well as trouble with her thyroid medication. She keeps suffering from chest pains, and I'm worried her health may worsen.

Beowulf's mother, who I also concider as a mother, is going through a lot of problems. She is scheduled for several surgeries in the next several months, including back and hip surgeries, as well as having to have her uterus removed as it is trying to push its way out on its own. She is in a great deal of pain, and may not live much longer, though she is fighting strongly to stay alive to see at least one grandchild being born.

As I said, all blessings, prayers, well wishes, etc. are greatly appreciated, no matter what your beliefs are. Thank you for your understanding."

Due to the freezing conditions, I'll be sleeping in the living room tonight.

I don't know what today has in store. I'm still all stuffy, and now very confused due to sleep deprevation. Sleep will probably remain a fleeting memory for the rest of the day until later at night, when I finally fall over form exaustion. Normally I can go three days without sleep with few worries. But that's in the summertime, and when I'm not sick. Right now I'm sick and it's freezing inside and outside. What happened to the nice warm weather we were having just last week? Oh yeah, it made me sick. Gah...

Still no sign of what my father will say (see previous post below). Of course, it's not even seven in the morning yet, so it's no wonder. I'm curious of what the possibility of breakfast would be.

He's a devoted Christian, though usually in my experience he's always been pretty closed-minded. So it surprised me when he said he had wanted to know more about the handfasting when I first brought it up. And so, after some deep concideration, I wrote the following email, strait from the heart.

It was difficult, especially when it came time to click ""Send"". But I managed it. And I feel I did the right thing. I can only hope the Goddess is with me in this... It's very hard, knowing I'll have to wait for a responce. I can't call, as it's after midnight, and tell him to check his email now.

I have a new email address. Hopefully I got yours right, so you'll actually see this. We switched over to BellSouth, since it's cheaper than EarthLink. So you need to update your address book...

Anyway, I found a webpage that describes principles the ritual of handfasting that Alex and I will be using when we are wed. There will be some differences, as every handfasting is different. We're planning on meeting with the priestess that may be performing the rite sometime in January. If you like, you're welcome to join us.

Here's the page I was telling you about: http://www.travellady.com/Issues/Issue59/wicca.htm

And yes, if you're wondering, Alex and I are both Wiccans. I had started my studies back in the seventh grade. But just to assure you, Wicca is a very positive, Earth-based religion. For the basic principles of Wicca, read this page: http://www.silverravenwolf.com/principles_of_belief_adult.htm

As it is usually the most common misunderstanding, I'm making a point of restating this particular point: 12. We do not accept the concept of ""absolute evil,"" nor do we worship any entity known as ""Satan"" or ""the Devil"" as defined by Christian Tradition. We do not seek power through the suffering of others, nor do we accept the concept that personal benefits can only be derived by denial to another.

I plan on writing an essay on Wicca and the handfasting ritual to explain things to everyone, as many of the people I hope to have attending are Christians. I know a lot of my family most likely is not going attend, which truly hurts me on the soul level. I hope you, Sandra, ""the brats"", Nena, and Pops will be an exception to that. I don't know if anyone on mom's side of the family, including mom herself, will be coming. I don't want to be alone on such a joyous occassion. I want to be able to cry tears of joy, not tears of sorrow.

If you have any questions on my beliefs, why I chose Wicca, etc., please do not hesitate to ask. I'll give you the best answer I have to offer, and if I don't know the answer, I'll try to find it. Keep in mind, many of my friends are Christian (Brittany, Robin, Riki, Chastity, and others). I'm not in any kind of cult or anything. And I feel most comfortable with this path I have chosen than with anything else life has offered me.

I tell you all this in hopes of finding acceptance. You never got the chance to really get to know me while I was growing up. And now, grown, I am able to decide on my own to be as honest with you as possible. I feel you have a right to know about my choice. I feel I have the right to be accepted for who I truly am, not for what people percieve me as. I want you to be able to actually know me now, instead of only knowing of me, as has been the case for the last eighteen years. I have always accepted your religious choices, even if I myself did not feel comfortable with them. What's right for you is right for you, just as what's right for me is right for me. I hope you feel the same way.

I hope to hear from you soon. I probably won't be able to reply in return until late tomorrow evening at the earliest, as I may be going over to Brittany's to help get a virus off her computer. As it is, I may have to reformat her computer eventually, if they have all the software disks. That's going to be...fun. *sigh* At least I'm getting plenty of experience in that.

I'll be going now. I love you, Daddy. I hope you love me enough to accept who I am.

Sincerely yours,
Alexandria

Things are looking up for me. I have found a very possible priestess for Beowulf's and my handfasting. And I may finally be able to see our dream come true of opening a metaphysical store in either Boaz or Albertville.

I finally got to talk to Lady Storm Wolf, who I discovered through Witches' Voice. As it turns out, she has the same dream. And we both have knowledges that will compliment each other's. So, it is quite possible that there will be a new store opening sometime in the future, as the only other store in our area that carries metaphysical merchendise is The Cool Store. But they don't carry as wide of a variety as they could. So there's a wide range of possibilities in opening a new store.

I ordered ""The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt"" for Beowulf, as he wanted it as soon as he saw my mom's copy laying on the table in the living room. I also ordered ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Wicca and Witchcraft"" (I couldn't resist, I swear!), ""Witch Crafting"", two two-for-in sets, ""Wicca for Life"" with ""The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-paganism"", and ""The Craft: A Witch's Book of Shadows"" with ""The Craft Companion: A Witch's Journal"", plus a three-in-one book ""Wicca"", ""Living Wicca"", and ""The Complete Book of Incense, Oils, and Brews"".

Right now, I'm reading the Idiot's Guide. It's actually a very helpful book.

"event","This is really beginning to worry me. All of my life, I have lived in the closet about almost everything: my writing, poetry, art, music, likes, dislikes, loves, losses, and beliefs. The only thing I didn't keep in was my talent for music, and it was difficult to do when I was always being praised by my band instructor.

I like a wide variety of things. I love knowing as much as I can about every subject I'm interested in. I love to listen to almost every kind of music (Country, Blue Grass, Gospel/Christian are the main exceptions). One of my favorite groups is Evanescence, even though I've only ever heard one album (Fallen). One of my favorite artists is ""Weird Al"" Yankovic. Two totally different styles. But I enjoy listening to them both. But I even get ridiculed for liking all sorts of music. Isn't that the purpose of music? To be enjoyed?

Back when I showed interest in Wicca, my mother supported me, even purchacing ""Teen Witch"" by Silver Ravenwolf for me as a gift at Yule (Christmas). Now, she just rolls her eyes and turns away, saying it's all nonsence. The rest of my family, if they found out, would probably think I was satanist or something (wouldn't be the first time...). I think I liked it better when people thought I was an atheist. At least I got left alone then... I never was an atheist. I always showed homage to my God and Goddess.

It irritates me more when I go on the internet and find that people here are still closed-minded on religion. It's truly a shame. But Wicca is one of the fasted growing religions in the U.S., and is recognised as a legal religion under the U.S. Constitution. And, at least, I'm lucky to find that handfastings are not all that uncommon or unwelcomed in Alabama: <a href=""http://www.travellady.com/Issues/Issue59/wicca.htm"">A Christian's Words on a Handfasting held in Birmingham, AL</a>.

But all the same, in the smaller cities of Alabama, like my own hometown of <a href=""http://www.boaz.net/"">Boaz, Alabama</a>, where racial and religious descrimination is still common place, I'm concerned about the well-being of my future family. Beowulf and I don't want to leave Boaz, with his mother being such bad condition. Plus, she's probably going to be the only grandparent that the children will really get to see, due to my families being so uptight about me being the only teenage girl on either side, and so automatically, I still get babied at times. Other than my nine-year-old half-sister on my father's side, I'm the only girl in my immediate family.

And so, now I speak freely of my religion only on the internet, though often going and doing research on the Craft at the local library. Surprisingly, it doesn't cause too much concern with the librarians, and there are actually a few books on Wicca there (though only a handful, especially compaired to the mass number based on other religions, mainly Christianity). But even here on the 'net, I find people are still too closed-minded.

One person who I talked with often confessed her matching beliefs to when I ranted briefly about how people are around here that if you don't practice Christianity, attend a Christian church, and attend the <i>right</i> Christian church, that you were either a satanist, or a goat-sacraficing devil-worshipping athiest (uh huh... Real bright, aren't they? And these are the adults, not the teenagers! Of course, the teenagers aren't far fome saying the same thing, though they usually include virgin-sacraficing as well). So I just don't know... Humanity is really beginning to worry me."

"event","Beowulf (I'll confess. I neglected to remember his whole magickal name...), my fiance, has a familiar. He's a black kitten named Salem. If I get the chance, I'll try to take some pictures of him. He's an adorable little fluff ball.

Salem was adopted into our family on October 31, 2003 during a celebration at my friend's house. Beowulf's ex-girlfriend had brought the poor dear to the party, starving for food, attention, and love. Beowulf and I immediately fell in love with him.

When we first took him in, we had trouble finding a place for him. Originally, we were going to have to take him to the shelter, but due to it being one in the morning, Beowulf's mother agreed to let the kitten stay for the night. That soon changed ""for a while"", and then that we could keep him there until we're ready to be on our own.

So now, Salem is a happy, healthy kitten who has been co-adopted by one of the other cats in their household, Weasle. They play and give each other baths, and are nap buddies under the Christmas tree (Beowulf's family is Christian).

And even though Salem is Beowulf's familiar, the sly thing keeps getting in my lap whenever I'm trying to study or work on ideas for my website or Book of Shadows. He's adorable when he does it too, as he stands patiently at my side until I lift my elbow for him to crawl up into my lap.

When he's just wanting attention, he'll start out by laying at the edge of my clipboard and slowly work his way to the center, stretching out so that no peice of the paper can be written on. Of course, when he wants to play, he goes strait for the pencil and tries to either steal it, eat it, or just bat it around.

With Beowulf, Salem will either start trying to play with or eat the book he's reading, or start batting and playing with his pentacle necklace. We're planning on getting a collar for him soon with a pentacle engraved on the tag, if we can find some place that will do that. If anyone knows of somewhere online, please let me know. Thanks, and blessed be!"

They're mad at me now because I wouldn't play them a song on my flute. People are <i>sleeping</i>! How can I play anything?

In other news, while looking for answers to the previous post, I came across communities concerning Otherkin, ranging from dragons, fae, elves, unicorns, vampires, and the like. Being a natural sorceress (long story; concerns Kemet), I have the ability to tell (more or less) when someone is not fully human. One of my friends is a dragon (poor thing got stuck in a rather idiotic human form), and my fiance is a vampire (which makes things all the more interesting). My Christian friend I keep refering to, well... She likes to believe she's human, but in fact she's got elven blood in her. It's clear as day stamped on her aura. I'm wondering when I should tell her...

So now, I sit and wait, wishing I could go somewhere, but I have no car of my own... A lack of funds keeps me from being able to get one, and in this small city, few places are apt to hire me. Perhaps, one day in the future, I'll rant about what I truly am...

Until then, merry part and blessed be.

"event","Okay. Now I'm beginning to wonder on just how strong of a Christian my friend really is, the more I think about it. Anyway...

My fiance, friends, and I all have a strong telepathic link with each other, and with beings from the astral planes. In this multiverse, giving a fictional character too much life suddenly means that somewhere out there in the planes, they really exsist. And this is where the problems arise...

You see, we're avid players of <i>Vampire: the Masquerade</i>, and go into great lengths in creating our characters. Well, suddenly things began to feel strange and then we weren't ourselves for short periods of time. The characters had come to live, and due to our channelling abilities, had come here. Needless to say, they were as confused as we were.

But one of my characters, Luke, a Toreador of the 5th Generation, has taken a liking to my friend. And her feelings are mutual. Which leads to her actively travelling through the astral planes during the day and night to talk to him. They've grown rather close... Too close, actually.

I'm afraid my friend is under the delusion that she's in love with Luke. The only problem is he's non-exsistant in this world, and his jealousy keeps her from trying to find a guy of her own age in this world. I've been trying to talk Luke out of continuing any relationship more than mere friends with her, but he's not cooperating (he can be as damned stubborn as any dragon or faery, that's for sure).

I'm at a lost of what to do. I'm worried about my friend, as she's not even attempting to even look towards the guys in this world, which is leading to many lesbian girls at her school to flirting with her, making her even more uncomfortable. And she seeks comfort in Luke... 

Since I often allow Luke to visit this realm via my physical form, I've grown accustomed to how his voice sounds through mine. I can mimic it flawlessly, and having created him, I know his reactions to every situation. I was thinking, if nothing else, I should perhaps ""fake it"" the next time she wants to talk to him, and explain to her that she needs to try to find love in this world.

I don't know what to do. I'm about to go seek answers from the dragons, if they'll listen. The fae are too playful around here to really give any even recognizable answers. They're always wanting me to play music for them. That's kind of difficult when everyone in the house is asleep..."

"event","Well, well, well. Looks like the quiz makers are becoming masters. They actually got it right, for a change. Amazing, really. I've never got a result that was accurate enough like this.

"event","Descrimination. That's all any of us usually recieve from anyone who is Christian. Even before I announced my faith to those in my life, I was looked down upon simply because I had pointed out very clearly that I do not believe in the aspects of Christianity. 

When they ask why... Three hour lecture on the lies the churches pass on to our youth. Yes, I know that sounds strange from an eighteen-year-old, but I'm a lot older mentally and emotionally than I am physically. Anyway, there are very few aspects of Christianity I agree with, and strangely enough, those aspects are also in Wicca. Go figure...

<hr>

While digging around in some of the LJ communities, I found a link to this article. It's things like this that makes me angry... Not at the proclaimed witch, but at the supposed Christian she's sueing.

<a href=""http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewForeignBureaus.asp?Page=%5CForeignBureaus%5Carchive%5C200311%5CFOR20031121b.html"">Witch Sues Christians Under Controversial Hate Laws</a>

<hr>

There's one thing I just can't seem to wrap my mind around. How is it you can tell a Christian that you don't believe in their God, but you're not an atheist either. I've always been more spiritual than religious anyway. That's why I turned to Wicca three years ago. But that Christian will always keep trying to convert you to their beliefs.

As this person is question is one of my dearest friends, I listen as patiently as I can, and then continue to explain that I'm different from her and that she needs to accept that. I'm never returning to Christianity, not after the problems I faced while being forced into that religion. I was just a child then. Now I'm old enough to make my own decisions, do as I please, and have whatever faith I believe in.

Well, there's my ten cents for today..."

"event","Three years ago, I had took my first steps away from Christianity and into Wicca. But the only person who supported me in this was my mother, though whenever any confrontation came up about the subject, she would abandon my efforts. I relented to the discrimination I received, and stopped practicing what I so strongly believed in. But I never stopped believing.

I look back, and realize that even then, my ties to Kemet were strong. I followed the guidance of the goddess Isis and the god Ra. They were, and still are, my allies in my search for a better life. And the other gods and goddesses of old are a great aid as well.

So now, with my fiance being a Wiccan himself, and my friends being supportive of almost everything I wish to do, I feel it is time to try again. And thus, I am returning to what I truly believe in. I am returning to the Wiccan path.

For privacy's sake, I will be going by the name of Goldyn StarWeaver. Please do not ask me for my real name, or any information about myself that I do not have in this post.

I am eighteen, female, and a resident of Alabama. I am happily engaged, though we have not decided on a date for the handfasting, as we have to find a priest and priestess first, plus aquire enough money to afford our own home.

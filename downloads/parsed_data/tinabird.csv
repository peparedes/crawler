While i was driving to local shows watching them skate and getting ice cream. Others in our class were experimenting with every drug they could get ahold of. He said matt had to move away to get away from it and hasn't heard from him since. :( Makes me sad. On a lighter note. I bought a new car! lol I'm excited to build up my credit. ok well i better go to bed. night"

This stupid thing i did tonight actualy made me feel a lot better but i feel like i should get far away from me.I decided to lerk a fb to see how him and his family were doing. I guess to put me to shame. Instead i was surprised to see he is no longer with his wife but has moved on to another girl. I almost feel sorry for her she is just about to be 22. She seems smart i know she has wanted to be with him for awhile. She was trying to be with him when me and him were togeather. Anyways, makes me feel good i was the only one he had a long relationship with that was mostly healthy. Now he is just gonna jump from person to person craving something real squeezing hard and holding tight cuz he knows he is incapable of letting it last. I know it's not me that ruined that relationship it was all him. I did learn from it and i can grow. I just hope i don't let myslef get suck back in. I have so much i can do and i know time will bring me someone who deserves me i just have to hold out and not let what i want fall to the side lines. Please please with all of me never let me be with him again."

I knew she was feeling bad but i never thought i would never see her again. I'm glad i didn't see her in the hospital with the breathing tubes and ivs in her i think i would just have that image haunt me. Instead i remember her being happy and loud and amazing. It took the whole family by surprise. It's so sad when the parents have to barry their kid. The last conversation with amber and i was one i'll remember forever. She told me ""teeny i'm so proud of you. I know your going to do great things."" I'm lucky to have such a great last memory i will cherish it forever. 

On my second note. I have found out my friend is being put on anti depressents. It doesn't shock me cuz i have a few friends who are on them. It more shocks me that i'm not on any. I mean i have days that are hard. Some how i manage to make it through them and still be pretty positive. I mean i'm constatly re evaluating how i live life and how i change the time frame in which i want to do things. But never have i thought i needed help. More than just some one to talk to. I guess i don't realize how strong i realy am. i know out of no where life will keep testing me i think with my family and amazing friends i will make it."

I figure i answer it and if you realy know me you will understand and if you don't then oh well. I have nothing to hide even if some times it may not be the best thing i have done or said i did it for a reason. Wether i was being fun or mad or scared or even crazy. I do things i do for reason and for the most part i do not regret much. I know who i am and i know in the end i'll look back and laugh and still be happy. People don't all ways like other that have nothing to hide. Often times being an open book leaves me to get hurt easy or i say too much about others and i hurt people. I don't mean to i don't do it on purpose but i figure if i have nothing to hide you should have nothing to hide. I guess some people just like things to be private. Anyways this is my last public post the rest will be for me only. I'm getting older and trying to move forward is hard when you all ways look back. I have to let go and start over i often lose my self in groups. It sad when your new friends say ""i wonder what you were like before""  i guess i notice i'm not the same and i just want to be me. And no justin me and alex are not togeather nor are we even friends.  He and i are two differnt people that keep moving in two differnt paths that we decided to give up. I guess you assume when i'm happy on here you think it's cuz of him no not the case infact i'm happy cuz of other people. I have tryed staying friends with everyone but people have moved on. I love all my BP kids ! I miss our rock band nights and i'll will all ways be fat for life lol. But now i'm done and moving on and i'll keep my memories forever.

i dunno wen your gonna get this and by the time u do it might not matter ne more.. i just really need 2 talk about this now.. or im gonna feel it all weekend. its not only about the entry, its about other things. latly ive felt so left behind in this little possi thing u kelli and callie have. i want 2 talk 2 u right now strait and i think this should stay between u and me (not showing kelli and/or callie no offense to them but we need 2 talk 2 each other bout this strait). but latly ive felt this thing from everyone. kelli and i arent getting along and callie and i arent as close as we used to b. yet all three of u guys are like, the best of friends wen im not there. and sometimes wen u talk about how much u dont like kelli and than u go off and hang out with her all the time. it hurts yo. alot of lil things are starting 2 hurt. like wen i go upstairs 2 get my stuff after scool and all u guys are all ready and than u all walk out without me. no one waits 4 me. and u sit here and say that we're best friends wen u do everything with kelli. like this party. i mean, it shouldnt bother me that much.. but it does.. im not mad about it and i no u prob didnt want 2 tell me cause this would happen. everyone was invited. everyone went. wat happened to me? and i wouldnt have been able 2 go if i was invited, cause im in ny and all, but still.. i never no wats goign on.. and everyone always has so much fun without me.. it makes me feel really bad sometimes.. i dont mean 2 feel this way if i had a choice i wouldnt, its just the fact that sometimes u tell me were best friends but than others i feel so left behind. i still concider u one of my best friends and i just wish that all of this would go away but its bothering me so much. y didnt u tell me bout the party? was i not allowed 2 no? was it some random thing? kuhn told me a few days ago that u guys were all going over 2 pats and i thought it was only u pat and kelli but it wasnt.. it was a whole party... and i mean it might have been pat but still.. please understand where im coming from. i just want 2 no wats really going on. hope u get this soon. 
love

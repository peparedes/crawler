"event","Okay...so Cape Town South Africa...haha or Cape Town Southern California.  Wow, KaapStad (its icky Afrikaans name) was quite a nice city, but so cosmopolitain, it reminded me more of California than Africa.  I'd say in general, like most other international studies, that I like Durban more than CPT (Which is interesting because almost every white south african you talk to will say cape town is the best place in all of Africa).  Durbs has so much more african flava than the designer africa of Cape Town.  This is not to say that I didn't have an amazing time, but once I post the pics (haha, I took almost 100), you'll know what I mean.

Hmm...some of the highlites of the trip - Robben Island, SA National Art Gallary, Slave Lodge Musuem, District 6 Musuem, batanical gardens, just walking around, and of course, being with Leah.  

Robben Island (the famous political prison where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned), was quite a moving experience.  You take a ferry about 20 minutes into the Atlantic Ocean (haha another ocean!!) and then get off.  The Island was so huge, much bigger than what I expected. Leah had gone to the Island with her mom when she visited CPT for the first time, so I went by myself.  I first went on a bus tour around the island and had a very interesting guide.  The Island has been used as one type of prison or another since the 17th Century.  We then went on a walking tour around the actual prison where much of the ANC leadership (and Mandela) were imprisoned for so long.  The tour guide that we had was actually a previous inmate, so as you can imagine, he was able to provide a great deal of insite and a very moving account of the struggle.  One of the most surreal, shocking, and moving moments, was when the guide pointed to me and said that where I was sitting was the exact spot of the bed in which he slept, for 12 years.  Wow...that was quite an odd feeling for me.

The National Art musuem was so, so nice and interesting.  It really reminded me of a smaller version of the Met in New York, only (obviously) more African centered. They had a huge gallary of modern pan-africanist art, which is my favorite genre of art that I have seen in SA.

The Slave Lodge Musuem had one of the most amazing exhibits that I have ever seen.  The exhibit was one put together by Archbishop Desmond Tutu (also a nobel prize winner) and featured pop culture icons and activists (Tutu, Steve Biko, MLK, Lennox Lewis, Santana and other people) with their hands and sayings about freedom, peace, and justice.  It was so cool, actuallt pretty hard to put into words, but I took some good pics that will be a bit more telling than me trying to describe it.

Other than the musuems, we had an amazing time just exploring the city.  We probobally walked about 6-7 miles a day (which was also nice because you can't really explore Durban like that), stayed in an amazing backpacker (an old victorian house restored all funky-like), and went to some really cool niteclubs and bars.  Leah was a wonderful travel partner, as we pretty much like all the exact same type of things."

"event",":::Here is a collection of random emails I have sent to people and fam:::

Well so anyhow, my last week has been quite good.  It is odd to finally settle in and have to actually do school work, but at the same time Durban is really beginning to feel like home.  So naturally, I like to now go on trips as often as possible.  I left on thursday to go to coffee bay in the Transkei (about 6 hours south of the durbs). I went with my friends leah, logan, (both from cali) and by dude Mark from the TZ (tanzania...he is prolly my best friend at the moment here...we share the swahili conection). We get to Coffee bay around 9pm that right, and naturally (oooh rural africa) there was no electicity.  We get stoned, make dinner under candle light, and drink wiskey, all with absolutly no idea of what anything is like around us.  I knew it was going to be a cool hostel when in the candle light, I see a sign that says ""Don't by zol (SA slang for weed) or mushrooms from the locals at the gate...we know where to get the good shit""  So anyhow we go to sleep and wake up in, yet again, one of the most beautiful places that I have ever seen.  Palm trees, a natural ampatheatre, a drum making workshop, and the beach, oh wow, pics will be up asap.  And another amazing things about the hostel was that, unlike the other places that I have been to that were mainly run by Europeans, this place was completely run by Xhosa's.  (An africa tribe...pronounced *click* hosa)  After we wake up, we chill for a bit, then go on a 15k hike through Xhosa villages to this place called hole in the wall.  Amazingly beautiful, and I got to jump off a 10 meter cliff into the indian ocean...awesome!!!!  After the hike, our guide took us to a shebeen, which is basically a speakeasy left over from aparthied where we drank palm wine and Xhosa beer.  And then it started to rain, real, real hard...and of course we had to ride in the back of a bakkie (pickup truck) in the african rain storm.  Also awesome.  So we get back and chill for a bit...and then find out that a traditional Xhosa full moon party was going on later that night.  Haha, and naturally I followed the advise of the sign and picked up some mushies (for 5 US bucks).  Then the party starts...huge drum circle, tons of Xhosa beer, traditional dancers, the works.  Fucking amazing.  So then I eat the mushrooms...before they kicked in, (thank god) the manager who I had made friends with ask me for some help in kicking out some drunk, racist Afrikaneers that were starting shit. Haha...me breaking up shit...doesn't matter where it is.  So they leave eventually and the party is still kicking.  Next thing I know I look at the stars and wow...haha shooting stars every fucking 2 seconds...then I realized...oh shit...it's begun.  I start playing in the drum circle, and then get the bright idea to go swimming, while stoned, drunk, and tripping...in the Indian Ocean.  So next thing I know, I'm butt ass naked swimming in the indian ocean at 2am.  It was, without a doubt, one of the most amazing experiences of my entire life.  So amazing.  Haha...I think that'll beat out most drug stories at home, by a long shot.

Hey guys...I just wanted to check in and say whats up from Durban, SA. Everything has been absolutly amazing so far...my campus is almost sickeningly beautiful... it looks like USC, UCLA, and tropical ass beautiful college.  Palm trees everywhere, main campus looks over the harbor (the largest in South Africa.)  My dorm room is nearly the size of MSU dorms and they are all singles...we share bathrooms, but thats no biggie.  And besides, my room looks over an amazing valley and I get to watch monkeys hop from tree to tree every morning.  We have a bar solely for our res hall, haha, and another bar next to the pool.  Hahaha...I swear this university encourages drinking.  The city of Durban is absolutly crazy...kinda reminds me a lil bit of the hectic areas of NYC...tons of people everywhere, street vendors, clutter...durban is almost like any big city...haha but it is also very interesting to walk down the street, or be in the mall (which is like any huge ass trendy mall) and be the only white people.  It is a very interesting experience.  The diversity here is huge...a large black, indian, and coloured (a perfectly acceptable term here...it means multiracial going back several generations) 

Haha...and going out...wow...you would never think Africa is trendy...haha...but it is trendy as fuck.  We went to this place called the Bat Centre...it is this huge performing arts venue that also has a nite club and on thursdays it is Hip Hop/ Kwaito nite.  (Kwaito is a form of SA music...kinda like hip hop and deep house together)  It was absolutly amazing...just the coolest, most artsy crowd there...and around 2am people started MCing on stage...absolutly amazing.  Haha...and you could openingly smoke weed right outisde.  Oh god...and the weed.  Haha..it is odd...it looks like crappy weed back at home...with seeds and shit...but it is absolutly amazing.  I was told by some people that they use all the hydroponic bullshit in the states to simulate the natural climate here.  By the way...you can buy it from the rastas in the marketplace...for 50 rand. 8 Bucks...for a quater ounce.  Awesome.  And it gets even better. 

Last week I decided to get the hell outta durban and explore.  I went with my friend tina...haha...to swaziland and mozambique.  Swazi was amazing...so beautiful, totally mountainous and mystical.  We stayed in a hostel (they call them backpackers) that was simply fucking amazing.  We walk in and an entire room is covered in pillows...a tropical bar, swimming pool, and some of the most amazing craziest people that I have ever met.   This Swazi guy Tabo taught us all this Zulu slang and stuff...haha then broke out the Swazi Gold...haha...even better than the stuff from the durbs. 

The next day we left for Mozambique...oh ya, we went the whole time on local transport so we were riding in mini buses (like vw buses) with 15-18 people in them plus a few like chickens.  We first stayed in Maputo (the capital) for a night.  The place was the shit...had such european flare to it...with cafes open late and artists selling their shit on the street. 

We next went to Tofu, Mozambique.  Perhaps the most beautiful fucking place on the face of the earth.  Picture the most beautiful beach you have ever seen, multiply that beauty by 10 and take away all the people.  We stayed at another backpacker there...the owner sold me a half ounce for 5 us dollars...and we jammed out on the drums while this mozambiqian guy sergio was playing guitar.  Absolutly fucking amazing.  The entire weeklong trip including transport, accomidations, food, drinks, and weed cost less than 800 rand. (150 bucks) 

Okay...now to some of the more real shit.  By this description you prolly think Southern Africa is some paradise...it is not.  The poverty is so striking.  Within 10k of my university there are shanty towns.  Not what you think of shanty towns in the movies, but real entire communities living in boxes and stuff.  That has been one of the hardest things to deal with. Being around all this amazing stuff, yet at the same time, poverty, poverty that you cannot even imagine, is so fucking close to it.  There is not really a middle class in SA...you are either rich or poor.  Straight up...and poor means really fucking poor.  And this is also not saying that all black africans are poor.  Some of the trendiest people I have ever seen live here. 

And AIDS.  The problem is so fucking big it is unimaginable.  Its not as if you notice people half dead walking down the streets...but you do start to notice a bit.  SA = 27%, Swaziland = 45%, and Mocanbique = 35%.  Those numbers speak for themselves.  And the hardest part is the problem is so fucking multileveled, it is hard to even begin to understand.  If you want to know more about it, email me. 

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Everything is, once again, going very well for me here in Durbs.  The past couple weeks have been mainly filled with a great deal of school, building up more relationships with people from all over Africa, hanging out with Leah, and having a good time in the city.  My classes are all going quite well.  My history class continues to be quite amazing as the professor is, quite possibly, the most brilliant man I have ever meet.  Brilliant, and also very cool (The other day we began signing Joni Mitchell and John Lennon when he was going on one of his socialist rampages about urbanization and the destruction of traditional lifestyles).  I have never looked forward to going to any class as much as I look forward to this one.  My developmental class is beginning to become much, much more interesting as we are almost done with all the theory, and will now move on to case studies and social experiments for the rest of the time.  Zulu is also going well, I had a test on thursday which I think I did fairly well on. 

So as I continue to learn more about South Africa and its political scene more things continue to shock, surprise, and influence my thinking.  First of all, lets take the ANC (African National Congress).  Before I came here, I always held the ANC in very, very high regard... I mean the ANC = Mandela = freedom, right?  But the sad thing, especially in regards to such a new democracy is that such mass support of the ANC has more or less turned SA into a one party system.  Mbeki won the last presidential election by like 72%, and although he is doing a fair job right now in the country (with the one large exception of denying the HIV/AIDS problem until 3 years ago), it seems as if a great deal of people vote for the ANC for what they symbolize, rather than what they do.  And like I have said before, the political parties are really almost completely divided down racial lines (although the ANC also has a small amount of white support).  This is not to marginalize the party, as if I were a citizen of South Africa, my vote would go to the ANC.  But, my friend Urshla (a Xhosa from J-burg) told me a horrific and scary story about the ANC.  During the 70's and 80's, at the height of the struggle, her father was very high up in the ANC.  She told me that her mom has letters that Mandela wrote him from when he was in prison.  He was friends with Mbeki, and basically a very powerful figure in the struggle and the construction of modern ANC ideology.  3 Years ago, he become dissatisfied with the way the ANC was going and decided to start his own political party, one with very leftist and socialist tendencies (which is increasingly popular in a country with the second largest gap between the rich and the poor in the world).  He began to get a great deal of mass support, and to make a long story short, according to Urshla, her father, 2 years ago was assassinated by the ANC.  He was shot 43 times and their house was burnt down.  However, she is an incredibly powerful African woman, who is in law school and intent on carrying on her fathers socialist legacy. She's not positive that it was the ANC that did it, but she told me she is nearly positive and after it happened, there were also news stories that suggested the ANC was behind the assassination.  Wow... 

So on to more positive things, I have been having a great time the past few days helping Leah show her mom, who came down to visit, all the cool places in Durban.  Although this completely made me miss you guys so much, (so much!) it was really fun to be able to get some of the parental vibe (believe it or not) and to be able to show someone around where you live.  I know I always say it, but Durban is really home now.  We had a nice time, her mom took us to some super nice restaurants and wined and dined us.  They left this morning to go to Cape Town and the Wine Region for a week (spring break...well fall break I guess, starts on Thursday!!!)  For the holiday, my friend Tina, mike, dave, and myself are going to Splashy Fen, a huge out door music festival...basically the bonnaroo of south africa!! (www.splashyfen.co.za)  It is in the Drakensburg moutains and should be amazing.  After the fest, I think were are going to hike for a day or two, then head back to durbs, where I am going to meet up with leah after she gets back from cape town and then we are going to go on a trip, most likely to Swaziland where we will go hiking, and possibly sleep over in a traditional Swazi village.

"event",":::Note:::This is an online version of my paper journal that I kept on my weeklong trip through the Kingdom of Swaziland and Mozambique:::

I suppose as I sit on our broken down (for the second time) Mozambiquian bus, it is time to reflect on the most amazing week of my entire 21 years of life on this earth.  We left Durban on 6 Feb 2005 ar 7am to catch a kombi (small mini-bus the size of a hippie vw bus) to the Kingdom of Swaziland (the only monarchy in Africa).  Tina and I missed our first kombi, but within an hour or so we were on one with 16 other people destined for the unknown.  The ride thru SA was fairly uneventful, but it was amazing to see the south african country side...although what we saw was nothing remarkable, it was super nice to see more than just the booming metropolis of Durban (I swear, it could be any US city).  After 2 hours, we arrived at the Swazi border...so much less pretentcious than any other border I've seen... (well, I haven't seen many...) a shack w/a couple entry forms, a few AKs, a gate, and a cold swazi orange fanta (pop). Once we entered Swaziland, the landscape dramatically changed.  No longer was I looking @ vast African plains, I was now in a mystical, mountainous, mysterous land.  It just felt, well not to use the cliche, but I will, so much more African, than what I have seen in SA.  We were in another cramped kombi until we arrived in Mbabane...which contained the craziest, most hectic marketplace imaginable.  Literally thousands of people selling everything from veggies and fruit that I have never before seen to live goats and chicken.  Crazy, so crazy.  Mbabane...the capital of Swazi land was basically the size of the coventry area of cleveland heights, yet it bustled like the heart of NYC, just with alot more soul.  After driving thru the serentity of mountains and then suddenly arriving in the madness was quite shocking, but luckily for us, a woman from the kombi that we arrived in (who spoke Saswaiti and no english) could sence our complete and utter confusion and she steered us in the right direction to a bus going to Manzini, that city that we were going to stay for the night before moving on to the Mozambiquian leg of our journey.  We got on the bus, a bit more luxurous than the kombi, which simply means no one is sitting on top of you...class time...update more soon."

I never thought that it would make you mad.  You really do mean alot to me.  I think you are smart, funny, and adorable.  I was in love with you all last semester.  And now...I messed our friendship up...all over that dumb journal entry.  I was being an asshole... but I thought you would take it just as messing with you, not as personally as you did.

I was not saying that you were dumb or anything like that.  It was not meant as a personal attack, we make fun of each other all the time.  I thought you were just going to call me an ass like u usually do and show me how wrong you think i was, and it would be over with.

"event","Ya know...I put this thing up like two hours ago and I have already gotten tons of responses.  People are such AIM voyeurs...haha...technology at its finest.

So I get an IM from a person that shall be un-named for right now.

She said: hey nice live journal

I say something in reply and get the following away message:

Auto response from **********: If i lived in 1920 id fight to vote cuz i think i should be able to.  I live in 2004 and im not fighting for drugs to be legal cuz i think they are bad mmmkay.


Obviously this young lady had absolutly no fucking idea about what it was that I was writing.  I wasn't writing about drugs being legal...fuckin A... I wasn't even really writing about the war on drugs.  Don't they teach you about metaphors in elementry school?  

According to www.dictionary.com a metaphor is : A figure of speech in which a word or phrase that ordinarily designates one thing is used to designate another.  

Well okay...my last entry was an extended metaphor.  An extended metaphor about going against social norms to create progress.  Human progress.  I am saying that it is our right, our fucking responsibility, to question our government.  If not, you are close minded...and that, is a god damn shame.  If live journals were around 200 years ago... ya never know...that same IM could be as follows:

Auto response from **********: If i lived in 1700 id fight for my independence cuz i think i should be able to.  I live in 1804 and im not fighting for niggers to have rights cuz i think they are bad mmmkay.

Or shit...put it in 2004.

Auto response from **********: If i lived in 1920 id fight to vote cuz i think i should be able to.  I live in 2004 and im not fighting for fags to be able to get married cuz i think they are bad mmmkay.


Message for *********, I am not attacking you personally by any means.  I respect your opinions, although I may not agree with them, this has nothing to do with you.  You know I dig you, I'm just proving a point.

And then you say: ""while u r fighting for the man, I'll be working for him.""

Ya know what...if that is your perogative...go for it.  Be a slave for the system.  That was like the black police man putting down apartheid protests in South Afica...hmm...makes alot of sense.  Work for what is holding you down.

But then she brought up a good point ""as long as you are a man, you are 'the man'.""  I understand what you are saying, but at the same time I'm not the one yelling and screaming about affirmative action being reverse-racism... or bitching about how I can't get a job because a minority with possibly less qualifications gets it instead of me.  I had a friend that got into Carnegie-Mellon (my top choice school)who was black, and you know what, I didn't bitch about it for one second.  Fuck it, maybe I do feel guilty for being born an average white, middle class male.  There is nothing I can do about that.  But ya know what?  I'm going to be the one fighting for those ""born"" less fortunate than me.  

I'm fucking sick of everyone bitching about reverse racism and bullshit like that when you don't even realize that automatic privileges you are given when you or born with white skin.  Todorov says that we can never really identify with ""the other,"" but fuck it, I'm at least going to try to help ""them"" in whatever way the need me to.

When you are working for the man, I'll be the one fighting for you to get paid the same amount of money as your male collegues.  

When you are working for the man, I'll be the one that is working to educate people in Africa to fight AIDS, so that the epidemic doesn't come here to the U.S. and kill you kids.  

When you are working for the man and you have the same job as your husband and you are making the same $100,000 a year...when before you would only make $80,000 per year...and can afford that nice Lexus SUV and you fuckin Louis Vitton Purse...


Then you might finally thank me, and people like me.  People that want to create progress in our society.  

People that believe that we can challenge social norms, and aren't scared to do it.

People of our generation that haven't lost the drive to truely change the world..."

"event","So I just had my meeting about racism and the war on drugs.  Wow...some people have been so trapped by the fucking man it's not even funny.  You say you won't question the law.  What the fuck...a female saying this?  Do you realize that you couldn't even fucking vote 1920??  You didn't question that?  How about seperate but equal.  Would you have not questioned the fact that black kids couldn't drink from the same water fountain as you?  Questioning the law is the most patriotic thing you can do.  And you call me a fucking ""dissenter.""  What if your precious Mike's Hard Lemonaid (which you aren't old enough to legally drink) was made illegal?  Would you question the law then?  Would you?  It is your fucking fault.  

The same kids that smoke their $50 eights out of their $400 bongs say that that the law which the punishment for crack is 900% harsher than the law for powder cocaine is not racist.   The reason that more minorities get locked up is because fucking Grosse Point kid's daddies will shell out $300 an hour for some slick ass high priced laywer...while at the same time their moms are washing down oxycotin with fucking martinis while daddy is addicted to valium and drink a triple scotch on the rocks every day after work...  But then we have some 15 year old kid in Detroit sellin dime bags on the corner to buy food for his family because his mom got evicted from her public housin cause her sister was sellin a couple rocks to support her heroine addiction which she started after her husband got locked away for 15 year for selling rocks to put her through school because of mandatory minimums.  All this 15 year old kid wants is to get out of the slums, go to college, and start a good life.  But one day he was wearing baggy pants and a FUBU jersey and gets searched by some 5-0.  Oh shit...now he can't go to college because the federal government won't give him financial aide for school because obviously he is a worthless human being.  Fuck him and his druggie ass.  That's what our government says.  What fucking hypocrisy. 

And you say that it is bad that I question our government.  Well fuck you then.  I thought our generation would be different.  It isn't.  All you god damn conservative ass holes (which you only are because of the fact mommy and daddy make alot of money and force their bullshit views down your throat) are fucking it up for people that finally think different.  But sad for us, you are the ones that will be making all the fucking money...thus running shit.  We have strayed so far from what our founders would have expected for us to be.  Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, fuck it, Locke, Hobbes, Aristotle, Plato...we can go all the way back, would be fuckin pissed at you right now.  They stood for justice, goodwill for all, and a government which respects its people...not fucking big business and the man.  What fucking hypocrisy. 

Forget ""damn the man...""  I say ""fuck em.""  Damn just isn't a strong enough word.  But I'm not saying I take our country for granted...I just think we have strayed so fucking far from where we should be it is fucking rediculous.  We have so much more than anyone else in the entire world...but our liberty and sense of justice is being flushed down the toilet just like the blunt the black kid is flushing when the fuckin 5-0 knock at his door cause he wears big pants and listens to rap music.  What fucking hypocrisy. 

But fuck it...I'll change it.  And I'm going to start working it now."

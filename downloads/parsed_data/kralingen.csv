According to Gerda's tradition, it is when you can first decorate for Christmas, so we did that this weekend.  

Today, after a lovely French toast with fruit and syrup brunch (I love our habit of one luxurious breakfast at home per weekend!) we walked into town.  We visited the Christmas market at the castle, wandered around downtown shopping and stopped on the way home to watch the fireworks (I told you this was a much bigger holiday here)."

We're not doing a great job of planning to see everyone we want to.  I'm worried that we're going to quickly end up near the end of our trip with too many people yet to see...

Sorry I've been terrible about updating this, I just do it when I feel like I have something to say..."

"event","Currently I'm teaching 10 hours a week (plus prep) and studying Swedish 22 hours a week (plus homework).  I'm fairly busy, but not breaking even.  

I'm really not sure where to go from here.  I'm worried that if I see teaching English to adults as my career here I will always be reliant on short term (4-12 week) contracts each with 2-4 hours teaching per week or so.  No security, multiple employers, no real room for advancement.  

If I go back to school for 3 years full time I would be qualified to teach in the school system here (I'd probably choose high school age) - or could even teach adult high school.  But I'm not sure that's what I want either.  And three years is a long time to be living off loans and savings...

If I'm considering going back to school then the doors are wide open to study anything.  I'd certainly want to make sure it's something that will lead directly into a career (no more general arts thank you very much) but again I haven't the foggiest what direction would be best (and palatable - I just couldn't stomach computers or business though they come with high probabilities of lucrative employment at the end...) 

I know I want a job with some activity - nothing that has me tied to a desk and a keyboard.  I also want security (not something that will be replaced by machines in 10 years) and flexible time (long vacations are important - even if I have to go without pay for that period).   Also, since we are currently living in Sweden but I don't think I want to live here forever something somewhat portable (or involving travel) would be good.  Another reason I'm hesitant to get a geographically restricted teaching degree).  I love teaching, love helping, love making the world a better place.  

I'm interested in your ideas.  Vast network of people in my life (and on the periphery) - what do you suggest I do?"

"event","So, in the past two weeks I've started both my jobs, signed up for Swedish classes and registered with the employment office.  I've also 'got' two more jobs with schools that just don't have any hours to offer me right now and just now I got an email job offer in my inbox to be a part-time examiner for Cambridge exams of English.

My job at Folkuniversitetet Uppsala is great.  The classes are nice and small (max 15 students - my biggest class is 12) and the subject matter is fairly easy (conversational English - means we can cover whatever we want to really).  Its too bad it's just 1.5 hours a night and only two nights a week, but its better than nothing.

My contract to teach Financial English to the accounting department of the giant engineering company is also going well.  We've had two of the three classes so far.  Again they're small (4-7 students) and the students are really nice.  I'm doing my best to manage the financial knowledge part (is there a difference between property and assets? What does this particular Swedish accounting term mean translate to in English?) by using online resources and a textbook the school that contracted me has provided.  

The two schools that have 'hired' me but not offered me any work are Folkuniversitetet Stockholm and another private language school - the London School of English.  Both are impressed with me it seems and will offer me work when its available in a few months time.  

I'm rather excited about this examiner job I've just been offered.  It would also be evenings it seems and probably mostly or entirely in Stockholm, but it pays better than teaching and yet there would be no prep work to do.  I'm not sure exactly what it does entail (am I just watching people answer multiple choice tests or would I be interviewing them?  OR assessing their written compositions and spoken answers?)  But we'll see where that goes.

In other news, Gerda and I are going home this weekend for the 20th anniversary celebrations at her elementary school.  It'll also be nice to see her parents again.  The train tickets only cost 164 SEK ($25) each way and the train is faster than driving!  

Gerda is enjoying her course for the most part.  There's some early mornings and some boring readings but she more often than not comes home with interesting information to share."

"event","We have returned from our trip hiking in the mountains in the north of Sweden.  You can see the photos on my google plus account (kehope).  It was fun, though my biggest complaint was that it was cold.  I'm a hot weather person - happiest over 25 C.  In the mountains it was 10-15 in the days and down to 5 or so at night (one night I noticed frost on the tent!) - this is AUGUST ladies and gentlemen...  We walked something like 65 km in 6 days.  Not too hard at all.  The trails varied from hard packed to rocky to muddy to bogs and twice we even had to take our boots off, roll up our pants and walk across rivers.  The Swedish Tourist Department has this all set up well too - they have either full out field stations (hotels really) or at least small emergency huts every 10 km or so.  There are lots of people that just hike from station to staying staying there over night and not even carrying a tent.  

Apartment
We have now moved in to our apartment in Uppsala.  We still haven't heard anything from the condo board but are hoping that since we're now living here they'll be ok with us :)  I've spent much of last week getting things for the apartment.  While we got it 'furnished' - it was only furnished for one person and rather sparsely so at that.  I've bought everything from a stepladder to a compost bin, spatulas to bed covers this week.  I've really enjoyed the chance to get out of the house, explore the town and get useful things done.  Gerda's been quite busy with school and frosh week and Janina's had a lot of studying to do.  

Uppsala
Uppsala is a pretty cool town.  Its small enough I can easily bike across it (not too different from the core of Ottawa I'd say, but without the same density of suburbs) but certainly big enough that it has everything.  Huge swaths of the town feel like they are almost nothing but apartments (and this despite the huge housing shortage!).  However, there are NO tall buildings.  This seems to be a Swedish thing in general.  We live on the 4th/5th floor of our building and that seems to be about the same height as everything is.  This means that even if you are on the edge of town you can still see the twin spires of the main cathedral since they are the tallest things anywhere.  Bikes are king here - there's really good (but not perfect) bike infrastructure here.  Bike lanes, a bike map special traffic lights and tonnes of bike racks!  However, people commonly don't seem to lock their bikes TO anything (just put the lock through the wheel) and the racks aren't designed for that either.  Everybody rides bikes to get everywhere.

Kulturnatten (The Culture Night)
This was an awesome mix of Nuit Blanche and Doors Open (for those from Toronto or otherwise familiar with those events).  This saturday, all day and all night every cultural organisation was out to show their stuff.  There were dance groups, political parties, ethnic groups, fire breathers, jousters, choirs, bands and lots of food.  Even the scouts were there (though I never found them). What's more, every museum and many public buildings were open late into the night and they were all free.  We checked out Carl Von Linnea (Linneaus)'s house and garden (he's from here), the Gustavium museum, the big cathedral, even the library (I got my library card at 10:15 pm!).  The whole of downtown was busy with people wandering about and everywhere you turned there was some other thing going on.  I was out from 5 pm to midnight and that was enough for me :)

I was signed up to go to kulturnatten with the Uppsala Expats - a meetup group I've joined online.  However, I was late and the organiser didn't return my texts so I ended up hanging out with just one other person - another girl who was also late for the meetup group.  We had a great time and I think I liked hanging with just one person better than being with a group.  

Jobs
I do have two small jobs now.  One is six half-days teaching financial English to the accounting department of a major engineering firm and the other is twelve weeks of teaching conversational English 2 hours a week.  That might increase to 8 hours if more students enroll.  Today I plan to call another 4 schools and hopefully send my resume off to them."

Her idea of paradise - and I'm going to do my best to enjoy it too :)  (You know I love camping, I just don't like being cold.)  I'll let you know how it went next week."

- finish work at Culture WOrks (writing final report cards as I write this)
- move out of our lovely apartment (Monday)
- Fly out of Canada (Thursday)
and arrive in Sweden (Friday)

Then it's off for a quick summer vacation before the real work for apartment and job hunting begins in time for ur new life to REALLY start in September.

"event","For the first time in my life I now have the big three: a job, an apartment and a significant other.  I've waited a long time for this and it feels really good.

I've been working at CultureWorks - the ESL program at UOIT - for about 6 weeks now and I am really loving it.  It's A LOT of work but its also very rewarding.

Our apartment is working out fairly well - nice neighbour upstairs, landlord seems reasonable, good space and all.  

And Gerda has a job too.  That's so important - she'd go nuts if she was just at home all day.  She's nannying for a family in Whitby - just 10km down the road from us."

"event","That's right!  I've signed up for a program at Seneca College.  I'm taking training to become a teacher of English as a Second Language (TESL).  I'm taking both the TESL 1 and TESL 2 qualifications.  TESL 1 qualifies me to teach 'abroad' and TESL 2 qualifies me to teach here in private classes and Goverment LINC (LAnguage Instruction for Newcomers to Canada) classes.  

The classes are at Newnhamn Campus - less than a 1 km from Mom's house where I'm staying now.  And I start monday at 8:55 (that's right, not 9, but 8:55) am.  I'm so excited!  

Today Gerda and I walked over to the campus to buy my books, get my student card etc...  It's so nice to have a direction again.  

In  other news, tonight we're going to see a TIFF movie.  We're going because its in Swedish and the Toronto Swedish meetup group is going."

In other news Gerda's decided to stay for at least the fall - possibly as long as May or June.  Yahoo!"

This always brings up the ever frustrating questions of how to get into the career I want.  I've been strongly leaning towards teaching English as a Second Language of some sort for over a year now but a few  key people in my life keep advising me against it - yet I have no better ideas really.  I think I'd like to teach adults/post-secondary students and I certainly want to be able to teach here, in Sweden and abroad.  Thoughts?"

We've done so much - many family and friend birthdays, a trip to the zoo, babysitting, luminato downtown, a play, job searching (I've found one for the summer - I'll be lifeguarding at a small apartment building pool), and enjoying Toronto.  We've also spent a weekend at Pathfinder camp and done a presentation for them on our work in India and on Swedish scouting.  This weekend we're going away to a very nice cottage with the girls I went to Rangers with. Will be nice to be out in the rocks and trees and water land again."

"event","Gerda comes a week from tonight!  Its so exciting :)

But in the meantime I have to keep slogging away on job applications (doing two more federal applications today) and cleaning house.  I've also been back to going to the gym regualrly since I've been back in TO and , work schedules permitting, I hope Gerda will come with me once she's here.  I've bought my membership at Oriole Community Centre and its ridiculously cheap - $36 for 3 months!  Very limited hours though - 5-9 pm five nights a week, 11 am - 2 pm tues and thurs (thats when I go) and saturday 10-1.  For now, that works for me :)

Last night was advancement for girl guides - the ceremoney when the girls who are old enough move up to the next age grouping.  I always love seeing all the girls together - ages 5-18!  You can really see the huge differences as they mature.  However its sad as there are fewer every year.  Partly this is because there are so many other demands on kids' time now than 20 or 30 years ago (more school pressure and more extra-cirriculars), partly this is due to a huge lack of public awareness of girl guides (""they still exist?!?"" or ""what's that?"") and partly this is due to a lack of adult volunteers to be leaders.  And now, I'm part of that problem - I've officially said I can't commit to being a full time leader next year.  I really hurts me - its something I really love doing - but its something I have to do to get my own life in order.  The pathfinder unit might close because of it - the other two guiders running it are also not willing to take on the full responsibilty."

"event","I have been sick - to varying degrees - since the end of March with digestive troubles.  I've seen a nurse twice.  Most recently she recommended probiotics (or something like that) so I've been taking them for four days now and it *might* be helping, but its slow progress.  The good news is I don't FEEL sick often now.  I was fine all day saturday and almost all ay today.  We'll see where this goes...

This weekend we went to Wendelsberg - a theatre college run by the temperance movement Gerda belongs to.  We were there with her theatre kids for the annual kids theatre festival.  About two hundred kids from groups like this all over Sweden performing their plays for each other, attending workshops and having fun.  It was a good time and I felt ok for most of it which was a relief.  

We contacted the migration board t oask about my visa application and were told that it could now take as long as October to come through (no fault of ours and nothing we can do about it)  - thats three months longer than we were orignailly told and it puts a huge wrench in our plans for the fall.  We're now facing a serious possibilty of spending the fall in Canada too...  No firms plan as of yet...

We're still job searching for the summer.  

I've got another possible job lead - we met a parent chaperone of the theatre group on the Wendelsberg trip who has a friend who owns a private english teaching business in Linkoping she'll connect me with.  A job in Linkping would be nice!  

Bedtime now :)"

"event","Just a quick note to let you know I'm still alive and very much enjoying my Swedish life.  I've helped at Gerda's old elementary school with her twice now.  We went skating on Sweden's deepest lake on long distance skates (not so easy to use!)  and actually now are headed up to her old college in the 'North (actally the middle) of Sweden.  We're taking two busses, a subway and a 10 hour car ride to get there today :S  We've got three movies, some MP3s and books to keep up compnay.  not to mention two of her friends in the car who he hasn't seen in 8 months.

Looking forward to meeting Gerda and her family.  Not anxious, or excited, or anything really.  I think those emotions will come in the next couple days.  Who knows where this path will lead.  I really want it to lead to something stable - relationship, job path, something.  I'm so tired of being uncertain, of floating, of having to take a paragraph to explain to people how my life is going...

"event","So, I'm not taking the CELTA course, at least not right now.  Its too expensive and its not clear it would help me get a job.  

I'm now thinking I'll go to Sweden for Feb-Mar ish to see Gerda, have some fun and lay the groundwork for looking for a job for the summer/fall.  If the schools say they'll hire me if I get the CELTA, then I'll do it when I'm back here in April.  I'd love if Gerda could come here possibly in May ish?  And then, if all goes well, I'd go back to Sweden June/July when the visa comes through?  That's the best plan I have now.

I did some preliminary research into English Schools in Sweden.  It seems there's about 8, with some having many locations others just one or two.  At least two said they were hiring, one specifically for the fall.  A number said they required candidates have EITHER a degree OR business experience OR teaching experience.  I've got at least two of those things - so that's promising!  I'll call them tomorrow morning (afternoon in Sweden).  

Also on the job hunt front I've started a three day course at the public library in Job hunting - networking, resumes, cover letters, job listings etc...  I've done one day so far and its pretty good - especially considering its free.

I may be a little crazy, this whole chapter is most unexpected and serendipitous, but its also fantastic and I'm very happy :)"

"event","ALl I want to do right now is be with Gerda, and to do that I have to go to Sweden.  

I'm super stressed about being able to afford it, and to find a job once I'm there, but I think it might just work out and I wanted to share this with someone...

I currently have $5000 in the bank.  I want to sell my laptop (bought in 2010 for $2400, never liked it, don't need it because I have my $500 netbook).  Let's say I can get $1500 for it (I'd like $2000, but I really don't know what a reasonable price is...)

That gives me $6500 to work with.

$150 - Applying for a 1 year work permit for Sweden
$500 - one way flight to sweden
$1920 - TESL (second best teaching english certification, supposedly just as good as the more expensive CELTA - $2400, but at a better school and at a better time - its in JAn so I could then spend february doing odd jobs and preparing to go)
$2300 - Minimum account balance for Sweden visa - to support myself until I find a job

Total costs  = $4865 with TESL ($5343 with CELTA) 
This allows a little breathing room - with the $5000-$6500 I have

Now for the complicated visa finagling.  Since I want to teach English I think i should request my Visa to be from August 2011-August 2012 so as to be for the entire school year.  However Gerda and I couldn't bear to  be apart until August.  I think I'll go on a tourist visa (or something else) for March-August and then have my work visa start in August. I would be searching for work in the spring, but only looking to start once my work visa started in august.  The standard tourist visa is only 3 months, but it seems it can be extended into a temporary residence permit easily.  I will double check all this with the embassy.  

OR, she could come here and we could both work until we both figure out what we want to study.  She'd have an easier time finding a job here (in Toronto, or Ottawa) than I would in Linskoping - both because its a smaller town but also because I don't speak Swedish and Gerda does speak English...).  But really where would we stay?  And do I want to commit to doing minimum wage work for a period of time?  

I'm about 75% sure me going to Sweden is the best solution for now.  I'd love to hear suggestions from all my friends and family.  I need support, love and guidance right now."

"event","So, I made it back to Toronto!  

Our last few days in Kochi were no picnic.  Gerda was sick (at one point so sick she needed to be rehydrated intravenously in hospital for a few hours) and so that's no good end to a great holiday.  However I think she's doing ok now.

We traveled back to Pune no problem.  It was good to be back at Sangam, but odd since the other CVPS weren't there, and there was always this overarching sadness since Gerda and I were both painfully aware that we were going to be parting ways soon.  

Gerda left on the 19th.  I saw her off at the Pune airport.  There were many tears, but we did it and she made it safely to Delhi and met with her family.  they're now on a whirlwind three week organised tour group tour of Northwestern India.  She'll be back in Sweden mid-January.

I left Sangam 6 pm on Dec 20th.  I was flying from Mumbai to Toronto via London - you know how London HEathrow and most of northwestern europe is paralysed with snow?  I wasn't optimistic about my travels going smoothly...

I had first a 4.5 hour drive from Pune to the Mumbai airport.  Once at the Mumbai airport I found out my Mumbai-London flight was delayed 3 hours (from 2:45 am to 5:30 am).  I considered seriously getting a refund on ym ticket and rebooking on another airline so I didn't have to fly via Europe.  However the BA rep talked me out of it and assured me there was no danger of me getting stuck in London - that Heathrow was operating at 100% capacity once again and everything was ok.  

So I spent the night in the Mumbai airport and caught my flight to London.  I slept a fair bit on that flight which helped me get onto the Toronto time zone sleep schedule - nice!  That flight landed in London at 10 am London time.  My flight out of London was at 12 noon London time and I needed 20 min to get to my new gate and 45 min for my luggage to be transferred (according to the BA agent in Mumbai).  However Heathrow is still a mess - we sat on the tarmac 2 hours waiting for a gate to de-plane at - so by the time I got off the plane it was the time my next flight was scheduled to depart!  I was hoping it would be delayed like everything else.  I ran into the airport when we finally got there and asked the first BA rep I saw about my flight.  she said ti was delayed until 12:40 and I might still make it but I should run.  So I ran through Heathrow as fast as I could - still had to go through two more security checkpoints - but I made it to the gate and onto the flight - one of the last people on the plane!  I spent all of 15 min in Heathrow airport when thousands have spent days stuck there and may not yet get where they're going by Christmas.  I feel guilty for that for sure.

The flight to Toronto was uneventful.  Upon arrival I found that my luggage hadn't made it onto the second flight - but BA assures me it will be delivered to my house here later today. 

I'm home and looking forward to Christmas - thank you Universe!"

"event","We've arrived in the last city on our south-eastern India tour - Kochi (aka Cochin).  Summary of the past few days

Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) - didn't do much.  Saw a play in Malayalam that was cool, visited the zoo.  Also got in contact with a very gregarious travel agent (he was a bit too much to take actually) who helped arrange the next few days for us. 

Nedumudi - we left Trivandrum a night early to head to a family homestay in the backwaters of Kerela.  The backwaters are hand-dredged canals used to irrigate rice fields and as a major mode of transportation in the region.  They're also beautiful!  We spent one night with a family there which was a nice break - although it was by far our most expensive night on the trip!  It was nice to just relax and to be social with other people.  To get there we took a two hour train (our last train in India - tear) and a 2.5 hour local boat through the backwaters.  That was really cool.  This boat operates like a bus stopping every few hundred meters to let people on or off.  certainly not a fast way to travel but quite memorable.  

Kumily - leaving the homestay we took a bus (40 min), another local boat (3 hrs), and another (long) bus (4.5 hours) - to get to Kumily.  Kumily is a little town next to Periyar wildlife sanctuary.  This was our chance to get out into the Indian bush and see some animals!  We stayed at the best hotel we've had yet - super comfy beds, warm running water (though not in the shower) and a view out over the sanctuary (all for just Rs 400 a night - that's like $10!)We stayed there three nights enjoying every minute.  We did a bamboo rafting trek through the sanctuary.  We walked for 1.5 hours, rafted for 1.5 hours, walked for an hour, rafted for 1.5 hours and walked for 1.5 hours.  It was relaxing and interesting, though we really didn't see much of anything in the way of wildlife. In Kumily we also saw a performance of Kathikali - the ritual dance drama of Kerela.  It was also interesting - they use a lot of eye movement and gestures to communicate - no words - though an hour was certainly enough. 

Kochi - now we are in Kochi.  We are staying in a lovely little guesthouse in the touristy old town of fort Kochi.  Today we wandered the town and saw the local sites.  This is a historically multicultural post town with Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch, British, Jewish and others living here. We saw the Chinese fishing nets, the oldest European church in India, Vasco Da Gama's house (first European to arrive in India via water).  The oddest part of the day was when we were looking at Vasco Da Gama's house where they were clearly filming something.  We asked about it and they said it was a Malayalam film (local Kerelan language) and then a man asked if we'd like to be in it.  We said they needed 5 foreigners for a scene they were doing tomorrow evening.  We'd have to dance in the background of a club/dance party scene.  We discussed it with the lady at our guesthouse and she said not to because it was at night and not in the well policed area of Fort Cochi.  We listened and were interested but after some discussion decided it was far too risky and turned down the offer.  While it would have been cool to be in a movie and nice to make some money they were going to drive us somewhere to film it, it was indoors, at night, and anything could have happened.  Still for a few hours there we considered it...

We'll be flying back to Pune on Dec 18.  Gerda and I part ways on the 19th (big tear!) and I fly home to Canada Dec 21.  See you soon!"

Goa - three days in Benaulim.  Very touristy, lovely beach.  Hassled by shop keepers and peddlars a lot.  Many, many complements on our Indian Pujabi outfits (seems most tourists dress like they're in Miama, not India).  

Karnataka - three days in the little temple town of Udupi.  Opposite of Goa - few people seemed to notice us - very few non-indian tourists.  Quite nice.  Took a night train from there - not as nice as the first one - lots more people getting on and off.  Hardly slept. 

Kerala - Indian state I've wanted to visit since I first learned about it in school in 2004.  Democratically communist, excellent track record in education (100% literacy), birth rate (dropped faster and more stedily than China with its one child policy) and women's equality.  Here we're also looking forward to a trek in the wildlife sanctuary, a night on a houseboat, perhaps another theatre play, another beach and more travelling adventures!"

"event","We are on day three of our awesome 21 day trip down the southwestern coast of India.  Today Gerda and I arrived in Madgaon/Margao - the second largest city in Goa.  From here's we'll take a short bus trip to Benaulim - a little town on the beach - to hang out for a couple days.  

We left Pune on Monday morning taking the 5 hour train to Mumbai.  In Mumbai we saw a play, walked a lot, visited 8th century Hindu caves on Elephanta Island and had dinner in a random tiny local restaurant.  We only stayed there one night.  On Tuesday after Elephanta and dinner we caught the 11pm night train to come here to Margao.  It took over 12 hours but was worth it - I love night trains!  This is only the third one I've ever taken.  Its certainly not boring - there's people selling all kinds of food (Chai, coffee, samosa, idlies, veggie cutlets, cheese sandwiches, bananas, cold drinks etc...), lots of different passengers (tourists, business people, students, families, who knows?) and I love the rocking feeling of being on a train.  I still feel the motion over an hour after we got off.  

I'm really looking forward to a relaxing couple days in the beach town of Benaulim."

"event","We only have one week left to the program.  This is very sad

I knew this was going to be too short a time when I signed up (I really wanted a one year posting) but it has flown by even faster than I had expected.  This is compounded by the fact that I feel overwhelmed with work to do (program evaluations, presentation, speech, as well as planning our December travels and figuring out what I'll do come January...), just when I'd like to spend extra time planning super special things for school and enjoying our last days in Pune.  

Today was our last day at Prayeja City - our construction site we visit on Fridays.  We started with a review of the emotions we'd been working on before diwali.  The kids had forgotten a lot but after playing some games (memory, go fish) they began to remember some or most of them.  

After this we practised writing.  For many of the kids writing their names in English is still a challenge (its their third language and their second script - they can read and write in Marathi and some Hindi).  We practised writing 'My name is' and their names on lined paper.  After they had gotten that they could take a piece of card paper and write it out on there like a poster.  We then gave them crimping scissors, glue, stickers, and markers to decorate their posters with.  Hopefully they'll take them home and put them up where they sleep so they'll remember what their name looks like in English.

After lunch we had the same boys back again (which is unusual since we normally have girls after lunch.  We think the kids are still on school holidays for Diwali which would explain why the boys stayed all day but doesn't explain where the girls were).  Since we normally re use our morning activities with the afternoon kids this put us in a bind.  We found a good solution in just letting them continue to play with the craft supplies and be creative.  They did this for about an hour just making pictures and posters and greeting cards.  They LOVED the stickers.  We also took them and the kindergartners outside to play with the parachute.   Parachute is fun but they get too crazy too fast - we had to stop a couple games because they were getting dangerous.  At the end of the day it was very hard to leave.  We had made a card for them, they had cards and messages for us.  We took lots of photos.  I'll miss those kids."

"event","Gerda and I have just returned from a fabulous holiday in Matheran.  Matheran is a tiny little town on top of some hills near Mumbai.  Its most unique feature, however, is not that its isolated by sheer cliffs from the valley below, but that motorised vehicles are not permitted in the town.  All travel is done by horse, hand pulled rickshaw or on foot.  The main activity is travelling to the viewpoints to gaze at the valleys, forests, rivers and villages below.  Some viewpoints are close to town and the farthest is no more than 3 km away.  The are numerous trails and pathways through the woods to follow to get to these viewpoints and one can spend long periods of time walking through the woods not seeing anyone else.  It was truly awesome - and a major contrast to the rest of India (and the downtown strip of Matheran itself).  The town of Matheran is a small strip of shops and restaurants with a feel similar to Niagara Falls or other tourist town; lots of lights, shops selling shoes and other leather articles, hammocks, and lots of chikki - a candy similar to peanut brittle crossedmwith sesame snaps very popular in the region.  We walked many kilometers in the woods, spent hours admiring beautiful views, and came home quite refreshed :)


Oh!  I almost forgot to mention the train ride!  To get to Matheran one first must get to Neral - the big town at the bottom of the hill.  From Neral you can either drive (or take taxi) or take the miniature train to get up to Matheran.  Matheran and Neral are only 2.5 km apart as the crow flies, however being ridiculously steep hill in between it takes 21 km of train track with something like 260 curves to get to the top.  Even so it takes this little train over 2 hours to chug up those 21 km of track.  The train is really cool though.  Its a narrow gage (2 ft wide) track and the train is only about 6 feet wide itself.  This means that often if you stick your head out the side of the train and look down you can't see the track, can't even see the ground under the track - you just see the sheer cliff down to the bottom.  Freaky, but awesome!  

We had some difficulty getting tickets to go up at first but after some persistence and luck we did get tickets, a seat and passage onto the train.  By halfway up we both had seats :)

Now its on to a few more days off before going back for our final two weeks of work (tear).  I think we're going to stay in Pune.  I've got a couple jobs to apply to, we want to see a theatre play and we've got Christmas cards to write."

"event","Last Tuesday I participated in one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen!  Laughter Yoga. (you tube it) It was a lot of fun!  We did about 20 different 'exercises' in half an hour.  everything from the 'mobile phone' ('dial' ten digits in th palm of your hand, pick up the phone and laugh!) to the motorbike (pretend to kick start it three times then 'drive' around the room laughing) to the cake (mime cutting a cake and putting a piece in everyone's mouth while, what else, laughing!)  Apparently there are hundreds of clubs in Pune alone that get up early every morning to do this :D

Last week we visited a local village about an hour away.  Shawn, the husband of Sangam's Manager, volunteers there once a week teaching English to the teachers so we took us with him.  Its an informal school for girls who have dropped out of the regular schools for one reason or another.  There's about 25 girls there all between ages 12 and 25.  We were asked to bring photos from home and so we showed them the pictures of our countries and our families.  The girls really enjoyed it.  We also learned a bit about their families (only one had pictures) and they showed us a dance.  After that we still had some time to kill so I taught them 'my paddle' in a round.  That was fun and afterwards they sang 'Row, row, row your boat' in a round which it seems they'd learned in English class.  

We visited that village again this week.  This time the girls took us on a tour of their village - about a 15 min walk from the school.  We saw the rice fields, the temples, the climbing trees (!), the well, the fruit trees (we tried tamarind - its very sour!).  Their home was mud with a metal and thatched roof.  It was the size of a large bedroom and housed 8 people.  What struck me most was there was only one tiny window - about the size of a cookie sheet - to let in light to the whole place - it was so dark!  I don't know how they cook let alone study in there.  It was really neat to see.  

On Friday after work we visited the Bharat Scouts and Guides HQ in Pune.  They have several buildings, including a gym and a large playing field.  We saw some of their program books and a few badges but they were sold out of most things.  As we were leaving the kids had arrived.  They come every evening - on weekdays they play games and do exercises and on Saturdays they do their scouting/guiding work. 

Diwali, the biggest holiday of the year, is coming up on Nov 5!  (its a bit like christmas in that its only officially one day but everyone takes more holiday than that.  Our school is closed for a week and a half.).   Since we have time off Gerda and I are going travelling.  We're going to visit the town of Matheran.  Its a small town in the hills between here and Mumbai.  Its supposed to be beautiful with many lookout points and many kilometers of hiking trails.  The best part is there are not motorised vehicles in the town.  The only way in is by a toy train and the only way around town is on foot.  We'll stay there for 4 days.  It should be lovely.  After that we're coming back to Sangam for the Wednesday since they have planned a tour of a sari factory for us.  After that we have until Monday again free and we haven't decided what we're doing with that time yet.

November is upon us.  Time has flown incredibly fast as I knew it would and we've only got a few weeks of work left.  After diwali Gerda and I only have two weeks of teaching left before the 26th, our last day.  After that we've got about three weeks of travelling to do (not really planned yet - though I know I really want to spend some time in Kerala) before her family flies in (to Delhi) on the 19th and I fly out of Mumbai on the 21st.  

This brings me to the topic of CHristmas.  Anyone with gift requests please let me know asap so I can start shopping for them (I know Heather wants a Sari - anyone else?)  ALso, family types, please start thinking of Christmas plans and let me know what days we're going to whose house etc...  Thirdly I have about 2 dozen handmade Christmas cards I've bought that I intend to mail out to all of you very soon.  Please email me your addresses before Nov 5.

"event","Yesterday we hd lunch at the hard rok cafe in Pune.  Not my first choice but others were going and I really wanted a steak.  We had some difficulty finding it - its hidden down a side road outside of town past fields of cows etc.. and inside a resort - but we got there eventually.  As we were eating our meal (mmmm...steeeaaaak) the waiter comes up and says the bartender likes my shirt.  If I would be willing to pick out any shirt in the gift shop he'd pay for it and I could give him my shirt.  The funny part is that I was wearing a Girl Guide t-shirt with the WAGGGS logo on the front and ""I'm 1 in ten million"" on the back. I took a photo of him and me with the shirts.  Anyone want a 'Hard Rock Cafe Pune"" T-shirt size large black with the words in silver rhinestones?  (a little small on me) I'll upload the photo as soon as I get a chance."

"event","This week at school we are doing a bunch of different things.  We are going to talk about Canada and Sweden - but this will have to mostly be a discussion using the teacher who's good at English to translate.  Also we thought we'd intorduce the verb 'to be' (I am, you are, she is etc...).  I tried this today.  The kids got ""I am"" and ""you are"" but they used ""she is"" the same as ""you are"".  I couldn't seem to demonstrate the difference.  I tried using names ""I am Kristen, you are Priti, she is Manasi"" but when I'd get them to try it they would always talk to the person who's name they used rather than talking to someone else so it's third person.  I then tried using standing, sitting, lying down.  having the girls in threes and having one sitting, standing and lying down.  They would then each have to say if what they were doing and what the others were doing but still they didn't seem to get the difference between you are and she is.  How frustrating.  Anyone with a better idea of how to show this is welcome to suggest it :)

This weekend we visited an old fort (it used to be seven stories tall and house 1000 people! but not is mostly ruins and rubble).  We went shopping in both Western style shops and on Laxmi road but I didn't buy anything.  We also saw Eat, Pray, Love.  I loved the book, the movie isn't nearly as good."

"event","This week in school we reviewed the themes from the past two weeks (animals and colours) and introduced the theme of shapes.  (well, only for the afternoon group, the morning group were sparse this week and needed to continue working on colours and animals anyways for the most part.).  Next week we'll work on geogrpahy and teach them a bit about other countries - including Canada and Sweden. (if you have good photos to show Canada - seasons, terrain, people, etc...) please send them to me now :)

On Wednesday we visited another organisation that CVPs sometimes work with.  It works in slum areas organising girls' groups and occasionally doing community plays on topics such as alcoholism or anemia.  

Today (friday) is the first day of the next festival.  Its called either Dassara or Navatri (or, says wikipedia a number of other names - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassera )

This festival honours a/the goddess.  In some ways all the goddessess are one and the same - and this festival is then for all of them as one - or this festival is specificaly for Durga or Laxmi - depending on who you talk to.  Yes its confusing.  So during this festival some people fast eating only root vegetables (or fruits?) to celebrate the bounty of the earth.  Another tradition is to wash and bless all the tools of work - whether they are a farmer's plow or an office worker's computer or a taxi driver's car.  This will occur on the 17th.  At Sangam everything will be cleaned and blessed on this day.  Also for this festival goddess statues are put outside.  On a certain day they are taken to the river and submerged like they did for the ganesh festival a few weeks ago.  Also involved in this festival is a lot of stick-dancing (Dandiya - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandiya ) and another kind of dancing called 'Garba'.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garba_%28dance%29 

Should be fun :)"

"event","Thursday we were called back from site at Lunchtime.  There was a major court verdict coming down that afternoon and Sangam was worried about anything happening.  Nothing did happen though - as soon as the verdict was announced it was challenged and sent up to the supreme court.  

Friday we were at the construction site again.  We're getting better at working with the preschoolers - though its still our greatest challenge.  

Saturday we did a lot of preparing for next week. we're finding preparing day by day to be quite time consuming so we're hoping this method of preparing a lot ahead of time works out.  We also took a bit of time to relax and went out for dinner.  We visited a restaurant called 'Spice Nation' just up the road in Vishrantwadi (Wadi).  We ordered the least spicy things on the menu and they were good. I'd definitely go back there :)  In the evening we watched Pretty Woman.  I'd never seen it before and quite enjoyed it, despite it being a romance.

Today we went on a trip to a local winery with the Sri Lankan group that's here.  I was a little too ill (nothing serious, not to worry) to participate in the tour but it was neat.  I had no idea there even were wineries in India!"

"event","Another day another fesitval!  

I love this country for its celebrations!  It seems at least half the time we'll be here will be one festival or another.

Today was the fifth day of the Ganesh festival and its the day Ganesh's sister(s)/Mother come.  Some people say its his sister Gauri who comes, others say its his two sisters Gauri and Laxmi.  Others say its his mother Parvati.  Either way it explains the statues of goddesses I saw for sale next to the Ganeshes.  

We visited Tarabai's home to see Gauri and Laxmi.  (Tarabai is the old woman who worked at Sangam from the day it opened until 1990 or so and still has all Sangam visitors visit her home.)  IT was a short visit but we saw the statues, chatted with Tarabai, had arti done (dots on foreheads and eating sweets for prasad) and tried the various sweets made for Gauri and Laxmi (every god has its favourite sweet :)

After dinner three of us wandered out to see what was happening in the neighbourhood.  We headed down line Bazaar and wandered into the parking lot of one apartment complex.  Peoplere were clearly out enjoying their Ganesh but there was no woman (sister mother or otherwise) with him.  We asked and they said they would be mostly in the home shrines, not out in the public one.  We chatted with the people there some more and several of them asked us to go down the street to their apartment complex to see their Ganesh and eat dinner with them.  We said we'd had dinner already but would love to see their Ganesh.  

Their Ganesh also was alone.  This was a bigger party though - probably 100 people in the parking garage eating food and chatting with loud music (Shakira's 'Africa' world cup song).  They insisted we have food - but we managed to barter it down to us sharing one place of just a very little taste of everything.  It was all good - but spicy.  I loved the dessert - pineapple corn meal prasad stuff.  They were impressed with our Hindi (had our first official lesson this morning - learned about 5 phrases) and in broken language were able to have a basic conversation.  After that they invited us to dance.  After some coaxing we got the kids to come dance with us too.  They offered to let us try the drums and the young men who normally beat them were impressed when I tried to beat them just as hard as they do :)  After about an hour we left and headed home.

On the way home we stopped and said hi to some other women.  We thought they were the family of one of the girls I know in Indira Nagar but they weren't.  They really wanted us to come to their home too!  In Canada I'd be very suspicious of any invitations to visit a person's home who I've never met but here we take them seriously!  It all feels so welcoming, so safe.  However We'd had enough Ganesh, Prasad and broken English conversations for one evening, and Gerda had to make a phone call home, so we stayed firm in declining the offer and everytually they relented and let us go :)  

I really love this frienly welcoming atmosphere.  I feel very much at home here :)"

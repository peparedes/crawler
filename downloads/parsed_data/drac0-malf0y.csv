Sad to say it but I think I've lost interest in Cho.  She's going to be in 7th year now.  That's not why I've lost interest in her.. I guess it's because I still fancy Potter way too much.  I'm a bloody poof.  Gahhhhh... 

Alright well nothing else to say, really.  A little more than a week until we all board the Hogwarts Express and go back to school.  Can't wait.. note the sarcasm.

"event","<div align=justify>Well, I guess I'll write about what happened last night.  I told Potter that I liked him, as <i>well</i> as Cho.  Ugh, out of all people I told HIM?  I told him not to tell anyone.  NOBODY IN THE WORLD.  Then I kissed him. ^_^  Wheeeee.

When we met everyone last night, the first thing Potter says to Cho is that I like her.  THEN he tells her about the kiss!  ACK!  At first Cho didn't believe him, but I told her the truth.  <b>I LIKE CHO CHANG.</b>  There, I said it.  What's WRONG with me?  First, I fall in love with a bloody GRYFFINDOR, who is my worst enemy, and then becomes my friend.  THEN, I have a crush on his GIRLFRIEND!  Father wouldn't be too pleased if he found out about this.  Especially the 'befriending Potter' part.

Later on, after Hermione and the others left, Cho dumped Harry.  Right in front of me.  I can't imagine how embarrassing that must've been.  He kept saying it was alright and that he understood, but then he RAN.  He RAN. OUT. OF. THE. ROOM.  I'm pretty sure he didn't want us to see him crying.  BUT THEN ... I asked Cho if she was going to look for guys right away.  She said, ""Yes.""  So I did the stupidest thing anyone could possibly do after my friends broke up.  I ASKED CHO OUT.  And you want to know what she said?

<i>YES.</i>

This means that she dumped Potter.  FOR ME!  =\  I dunno whether to be happy or sad about that.

Cho said that Harry and Fleur would make a good couple.  But, I know Harry wouldn't go out with that veela if his life depended on it.  I honestly feel terrible, but I'm delighted at the same time.

What, oh what to do?

Commonly known as SexGod!Draco, you are usually bisexual. You are horny as hell, and gorgeous as heaven, and you take advantage of both of these things to have sex with ten different people in one chapter of one fic. You are cheerful and very open about your lust. It is rare that a threatening Voldemort-type plotline will come into your story. And...did I say you were horny?<br>

"event","<div align=justify>Thanks to MOI, Ron Weasley has a journal.  <lj user=""r0n_weasley""> << click to see his journal.  I don't know if he's written anything.  This'll bring some joy to Potter's life, I don't doubt.  You owe me a code, Weasley.  ASAP, too.

I've gotten myself a new icon, and I'm sure it does exactly what it says.  =) That means you, Potter.  And you too, Granger.  Speaking of which ... I've found *someone* quite attractive in the last few days ( NO, IT'S NOT POTTER, although I doubt I'm over him.  LUCKY ME. ), and I think I'm begining to have a crush on that person.  Haha.  You don't know if it's a guy or girl.  AND YOU NEVER WILL!  Unless you trade me answers for sex, that is.  And donuts.  I like donuts.

"event","<div align=justify>Well, that's right, folks -- Lavender Brown has gotten a <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~lavender_br0wn"">LiveJournal</a>.  Welcome to LiveJournal, Lavender, where people share their thoughts, and tell people how sexy they are ( that's in my case ).  And, another newsflash :: Potter and Chang are going out.  Well, good for them.  Hmm.  I remember that one evening, must've been the night Harry finally told Cho how he felt, and he was sobbing on my shoulder.  Probably the best I'll ever get from him, eh?  Well, we all have hopes and dreams.  I was thinking back to our first day at Hogwarts.  I was SUCH AN ARSEHOLE.  No wonder Potter didn't accept my hand in friendship.  Now I feel <b>so damn lucky</b> to have such great friends.

I know I should really be in the Great Hall right now, eating dinner, but I sort-of lost my appetite, and I felt as though I haven't been giving the world enough luvin' to know what's going on in my life.  So, alas, here I am, typing in this fucked up journal.  How pleasant.  I sent my mum a box of chocolates from Honeydukes this morning for Mothers' Day, and she sent me a thank you letter back around lunchtime.  I love my mum, and I despise my father.  He's evil.  I know I've been bragging for who-knows-how-long about becoming a Death Eater, but now, things have changed.  I don't want that.  I don't want to hurt anyone, especially their main target: Harry.

I think I'll go upstairs now, and drown myself in a nice, warm shower.  You're invited to come if you want.

"event","<div align=justify>Sorry I haven't updated.  Lately I've been moping about, all depressed and stuff.  It's hard, you know?  To actually have feelings towards someone, still knowing it's not going to happen.  Besides that, nobody leaves me comments.  Bah.

I'm still the sexiest damn thing in Slytherin.  I'm the sexiest damn thing in Hogwarts, as well.  I love the way Cho has designed her journal -- perhaps I can bribe that muggle girl to make mine all cool and shit.

I'm off to bed.  G'nite.

"event","<div align=justify>Oh, and what a day it has been.  I hung out today with the usual gang ( Harry, Cho, Hermione, Ron; Lavender came today, too ).  Nobody really questioned my 'sexuality' today.  I'm not really embarrassed to say it anymore.  The most supportive has been Potter.  Definitely, by far.  Cho and Hermione still seem a little hesitant, but I have this feeling that Harry thinks I'm going to rape him any second or something.  Hmm, me just being my demented, paranoid self.  Whaaaatever.  Then, Ron and Cho got in a bitch-slap contest.  It was quite amusing, but it distrupted our 'wonderful' game of truth or dare.  I've come to despise the game ... it's the whole reason the world knows about my ... erm ... sexuality.  ANYWAY, moving on.

Lavender Brown decided to finally join us.  Mmhmm.  It seems the Weasley's have all dissapeared.  Ginny hasn't been around forever, and I think that Fred and George have run away to start a joke shop.  But hey, who am <b><i>I</b></i> to complain?

"event","<div align=justify>Alright.  Word's out.  Yes, I hope EVERYONE is happy now.  ARE YOU ALL HAPPY?  Good.  I'm glad I can finally go about my ways ... I dunno if the entire truth is out.  Um, this is how it started:

We ( me, Harry, Cho, and Hermione ) were playing truth or dare.  I asked Harry, and of course, being the courageous Gryffindor he is, he took dare.  So, being the stupid arsehole I am, I dared him to kiss me.  Then, well, I bet you know how the rest of the story goes.  I feel like Harry's mad at me, but I really don't know what to do.  I'm really upset.  And confused ...

I really have an urge to write something I shouldn't because then everyone will know something I don't want them to so I won't write it but I will confide it perhaps at a later time.  Adios.

I see some fellow peers of mine have already made themselves home here.  And, a <a href=""http://livejournal.com/~harry_p0tter"">certain</a> person has already started babbling on about how he hates me oh, so much.  Wonderful, isn't it?  Now I can listen to the actual thoughts and ramblings of everyone else.  Well, there's not too many people to listen to so far.  But, time will come for that.

Let's see, I've already changed the layout on this thing to green ( one of Slytherin's colors, if you haven't noticed already ), and I've changed my moods.  I've also added friends.  Now, how to get a picture of my sexy self on here ...

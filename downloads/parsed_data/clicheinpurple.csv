"event","Today is a sad day for alternative music in Sheffield.  Tonight it's the last Planet Zogg, which, after 5 years, is having venue trouble and is being squashed out of the club scene in this city by a seemingly unstoppable tide of bad taste and townification.  It is most definitely not fair.  

On the up side, the night is run by people who are passionate about the music so I doubt this will be the very last one, but it certainly is for the time being..

To be honest I don't even feel like going out really but I have to pay my respects, and there are so many people there I want to say goodbye to.  So, I'm going to drink a large amount of cider, followed by a large amount of blue rat, and get ready to jump about and generally make an exhibition of myself in public!  hehe

R.I.P. Zogg (but I have an eerie feeling some kind of spectacular messianic resurrection will happen.  Perhaps I'm being naively hopeful)..."

"event","Grrr.  I've been looking forward for bloody ages to getting my course back on track, then my tutor cancelled our meeting today so I have to wait around twiddling my thumbs for another week.  Dammit...  I've got stuff to do for my job but I need my life to have some more structure after a fairly long period of inactivity (I had nearly overworked myself into an early grave in June and thought a long break would be sensible!)  

Oh well, tis no more than a minor setback I'm sure..  

I'm getting paid in a week though, yay!  More adventures!"

"event","Yes, both of you... I seem to have somehow managed to get myself booked to dj at a night in Sheffield in a few weeks, and am looking forward to the opportunity to foist my modest record collection on an unsuspecting public!  Expect Joy Division aplenty and at least one technical 'mishap' during my set - the possibilities are endless: pint spillage, general clumsiness, electrocution...  Sheffield, you have been warned!  Hehehe"

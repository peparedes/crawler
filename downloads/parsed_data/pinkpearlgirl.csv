"event","Failing anything is what I fear most. Failing means that you aren't ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready for life and the funny thing is its been here all along. I am 19 and I keep wondering when life is going to happen but its been happening. Why is it so hard to crasp the consept that your life begins the second you are born? Why is it that most of us think that life begins when you land your first job, get married and start a family. I feel like every year I live is just to prepare for the next and so on. If I fail today, this week, this month, this year life goes on anyway. I want to know when its going to stop. When will I be able to sit back and say ""now I am satisfied, now I can live""? The truth is many of us want to know the answer to that question but its not that easy. We beat our selves up so that we are ahead of the game, so we are successful because thats what life is all about. If you fail then you are bad at the game of life; you are bad at living. But failure and success are measured in many ways. In school when you get an F then you failed. In life when you lose all of your money, cheat on your spouse,steal,kill,lie then you failed. Society creats standards of measurement.
  Today I failed. I found out that I got a 52 on my accounting test. When I failed that test I failed much more than just accounting, I failed myself. I wasn't ready. Now my grades are going to be lower, my GPA is going to drop and I will have to work that much harder to get ahead. But isn't that what life is all about? Getting ahead."

"event","so I think the last time I wrote in this thing had to be months ago... I can't believe that August is here and in just a couple of weeks I will be leaving to live in an entirely new town with only a few familiar faces to comfort me. College is a huge part of life and I don't know if I should be happy or sad, excited or scared. Everything that I know now is about to change forever and my worst fear is getting to college and wanting to nothing more than go back to what I had before and even worse what if I am the only one of my friends who feels that way? Suppose I come back from my first year at college and I am the only one who wishes that nothing had changed? I understand that it is ok to feel afraid of moving out and on with your life but there is always that doubt in the back of my mind that what I want to happen and what may actually happen could be totally different."

"event","One of the most wonderful places to ""people watch"" is a coffee shope, with a quiet setting and jazz music playing one can't help but feel inner peace and so in effect they are apt to start political and ideological and even sometimes theological discussions,but it also allows friends to sit and chat about the hot gossip and for young lovers to look deeply into eachother's eyes and wisper mawkish secrets using their lover's language. It so happend that I witnessed such happenigs as I tried hard to focus on the AP Test prep book in front of me but I couldn't resist being entertained.

  I was sitting quitely looking absently at the page in front of me when my ears wondered to the table in the corner where sat two young, no doubt Liberty Students. The couple had been looking at what seemed to be a course book, which course I am unsure but it must have been politics because the next table over an old man who to me resembled an old college professor began talking to the couple and soon they were discussing the war that President Bush declared and how he could be, in the eyes of the professor,compred to a Nazi.The girl told the professor she disagreed with his view on the point ,that Bush was not killing the Iraq citizens in the intrest of purification but that he was fighting the small pockets of terrorists. As this debate became heated and the proffessor mumbled his response I became bored and switched my interests to the young lovers sitting at the next table over. 
   The lovers were deffinatly in college but I would not be suprized if they were sophmores because they looked no older than 20, and inthraled in passion they were! Looking into eachother's eyes as if there were no tomorrow and he taking her hand as her read to her with a sweet twinkle in both their eyes, it was enough to make me sick. I thought that ""ok eithter these kids have never experienced sex, or they are really inlove"" take your pick. I had to laugh because as I looked at the guy I swear he had to be gay. I let my thoughts continue  and I began to wonder where that couple would be ten years from now, would they actually get marrie? She had the ring, but where they really in love? What if he was gay, would he finally give in to his love for men and leave his wife and kids? Maybe they don't get married. Or perhaps they havn;t had sex because they are sharing the experience on their wedding night and they get to it and its not at all what they expect, will they stay together? If the sex is bad will they want to see if its better with someone else? All of these quesions but no answers. Finally I give up and my enterest falls on the lonely bald guy sitting at the bar. He is about 45 or older , he is married and looks content with his life, there isn't much of a story here except he looks strong in his flannel button down shirt and I wonder if he is a police officer of some man of importance. He looks at me and smiles but I give no response I just continue to pretend reading. I agin switch my enterst to the couple from LU have a political discussion which I can't even begin to tell you what it was about exceot that it was coming to an end as the proffesor began to speak about God and the students begin to pack. With a few more words the professor applogies I guess because he feels guilty for being so passionate and switfty leaves. The two students are left only sitting in silence looking at eachoter wondering where the strange man came from and was he right or wrong? As the students pack thier thigs they say noghitng and leave. I too have had enough, now that the debate is over and the room hold me and the annoying lovers I take my book and leave. 
   I walk to my car just in time to see the LU students leave and I giggle and think "" people watching is probablly the most wonderful form of ebtertainment, I really must do this more offten."""

Saturday was better I went to the UVa game with the Milams and that was fun,I got to see Casey , Erik and Allison. I witnessed a little girl defending some college guys from yet another redneck. That was great , I really don't think drunk rednecks should be allowed at football games they are so gross!After the game we went to dinner at the Hardware restaurant where Megan and I investigated the pickle buffet, it was absolutely disgusting  but the dill ones were good. Then after filling our tummies we walked around the outdoor mall and admired weird yet beautiful jewlery. Nick bought a lucky buddha man for his poker games and I almost bought a necklace charm but decided that it was an impulse buy. There is something about the last summer and early fall up in C-ville that makes saturday nights so nice. I wish I could go to UVa and party with the best of them but its not for me. Hopefully I can come crash with some of my friends who end-up there. Well while I'm on the subject of college that reminds me I need to go work on my ELON application. ELON is my UVa.bye yall!"

"event","Bitches and hoes,everyone at glass is a bitch or a hoe. Haha just kidding but I bet that got your attention. Today was just like any other but since its the third six weeks teachers are testing like whooa! I hate tests they suck! I wish I was a super genius so I wouldn't have to work so much but since that isn't the case it looks like I'm gonna have to crack down and study. I had a revolution today while riding home with shuppy and that is, I'll probably never be a Doctor. One because I am too easily discouraged and with that attitude I will be weeded out of the pre-med program with the first round, second I don't really know why I want to be a doctor I know I love to help people and I find medicine very interesting but that isn't enough. Ugh there are so many things I want to do but I know I can't do them all. Oh well thats enough of pondering. Maybe I'll get lucky and marry a guy that can support me and the kids and I can run the garden club! Just kidding. chow mama!
also the best movies in the world are serendipity and under the tuscan sun"

"event","its sunday night and instead of doing my homework I'm here writing. This weekend was a strange one, why? I do not know. I do everything I normally do but for some reason it felt just a little different. Maybe its because friday night mayhem was thursday night and friday night was movie night/girls night/poker sucks night. Yea I said it , I hate poker and anyone who has a problem with it I don't care! Saturday was one of those lay around and do nothing days. You know when you wake up just in time to see the clock turn to 12:00 and then you think ah, who cares. Then you don't know what to eat because to you its breakfast but to the rest of the world its lunch and you don't know if you feel like that bowl of cereal anyway. I did actually accomplish my goal to write my college essay but at the moment I'm also procrastinating in revising it.Maybe this weekend was strange because of the weather. The trees are slowly undressing them selves and teasing those of us who refuse to let the summer go even though all hopes of getting it back are useless. I have to face it some time the summer is gone and this year I will go from senior to freshman and form child to young adult, so much change is coming and the little butterflies are causing me to worry just a tad. I can't believe that this is it. Soon I will have no time for this little journal and you the reader will have no time to read it . The thought that the moments I have been looking forward too are fast approaching is almost surreal.well I have gone on for too long good night!"

"event","Today I spent the day exploring the unknown...I walked the steps dedicated to those who lost their lives, I spelled the sweet scent of a rose and looked out upon the vast city that I call oL' lynchburg. Yes today I missed a whole day of education to learn and explore my city. Along with all my other fellow students I learned about the renovations that have already taken place and are planned to take place. After this wonderful day I went home and worked diligenlty on my studies and learned that War Vets offten write about their war experiences to inform those at home that it is uterrly pointless to fight with the lives of men. I wonder if George Bush eer read Goin after Cacciato? My guess is no but anything can happen right? Well its about 9:15 and I'm really bored.With my homework complete and no good tv shows on I have noghitn else to do but write.Its strange that this live journal thing can actually be useful.If is was still summer I would deffinaitly be out, school seems so dull and the way it controls our lives seems almost hopeless somtimes. I wake up every morning, manage to roll over to look at my alarm clock only to find that I have about 45 minutes before I have to wake up. I try my best to go back to sleep but I find myself already going through the day. I think to myself, Do I have any appointments today? I wonder how much homework I will have? What am I going to wear? After about five minutes of interigating myself and the failure of trying to get back to sleep I finally push the sheets back and curl my toes onto the carpet. I look out the wondow to decide what the attire of the day should be. My family is already awake  and I'm not hungry so I imedatly tyrn to the bathroom. After 30mins I'm ready to go and I have my keys in hand, I go to my car and turn onto Boonsboro RD. I listen to NPR and hear the radio bradcaster list the headlines and all the bad things that seem to be oevrtaking the world today. I go to school and then come home . Everyday its the same thing. I wonder when all of this will change and I can make a whole new routine..."

"event","well today hasn't been all that exciting. I went shopping this morning ,bought some perfume and some pants from American eagle and that was fun.. I looked at all the department stores for some dock siders but no one has them so I 'll probably have to order them off of the web. ummmmm.... after that I came home and just hung around , played with the kittens and watched TV. I'm a little tired so I think a nap sounds pretty good or I might give my self a pedicure /manicure. well I'm gonna go talk to yall later!"

"event","Well to start off today wasn't really all that bad. I had to get to school fairly early so I could fix my schedule but since the guidence office was out of control I didn't get to far with that. Chemistry was ok except I felt really retarded when I couldn't find X in these really simple solution problems because its been so long since I've done them. Keyboarding was amusing because Mr.Kennedy sounds like that teacher off of South Park 'umm k"" haha its great! Political science is a blast I wish all of my teachers were as enthusiastic about teaching then I would actually look forward to going to school. Hell I would probably be excited about learning. Well then the rest of the day just floated by..Im kinda sad that lunch conatins only five guys and my self, but at least one of those guys is mine so thats nice. I bet that would make for an enteresting tv show, five guys and girl in stead of just three. Yea well I've run out of awsomeness and my journal is getting boreing so I guess I'll stop here. Love yall!"

"event","ok,
  Well today I had an okay day but the fact that summer is a thing of the past kinda sucks! And not to mention that my schedule sucks and yea that needs to get changed as soon as possible. And many thanks to chelsea for helping me put together my live journal because as we all know I'm computer and technologically impaired....  Well then I ended the day off with some tasty DQ hoping to get back a little bit of the summer that was so unjustly taken from me. GGRR but you know its our senior year and we should enjoy because these times will never come around again. So out with the books, sharpen those pencils and hang all the tressel signs you can, and whoo hoo for seniors. This year is all ours and I'm gonna take it for granted.I don't know about you but I'm gonna go to all the Football games, dances, functions, BYOB parties, ""capture the flag"" and wood gatherings as I can get to! yea except for the beach of course beacuse that place sketches me out, you know the one."

"event","god damn im getting fucking pissed. oh well if i own a pair of converse hi tops. oh fucking well. i like them, i love the color blue. and wat do ya know they are blue. So a lot of people own a pair of them oh well, a lot of people are wearing etnies. fucking etnies. they are skater shoes basically but oh well if people like them they can wear them not have other fuckin people make fun of them just because they fuckin own a pair of them. god damn it. 

shoes are fucking shoes. i love my blue shoes but i dont need fucking people tellin me what i can and can not wear just because a lot of other people own the same brand. cause it puts me down. 

why must u people put people down?? why?? do you think your better?? do you think your stronger?? is that one person not cool enough?? are they not up to your standards?? well fuck you! grow up people. 

PEOPLE SHOULD JUST GROW THE FUCK UP AND LIVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES. STOP PAYING ATTENTION WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE WEARING, ESPEICALLY THEIR SHOES! OR ANYTHING! 

also one more thing, stop yelin at people just because you tihnk they changed when your the one who changed the most. actually you changed into the person you always made fun of and didnt want to be but now you are. fuck you."

i wanted to fucking hang out with titus so bad it isnt even funny. i havnt seen him in so long and i thought it would be awesome ot see tonight but no jill had to make me fuckin run to the fuckin car and made me leave and then titus i guess couldnt find the house. hes one of my best friends, hes an awesome kid but god damn it. i just want ot fucking cry.

i thought birthdays are suppose to be fun but i guessed wrong. they turn out wrong and make yo uwant to tear your heart out and cry. i wanted to be with my friends and have a great time but no. everything went wrong. i should of just stayed home but i didnt. 


the one time titus was here in ohio and i couldnt even see him on my birthday or any day of the week. i feel like a stupid bitch and i should. i know i am everyone thinks it. 

is it wrong to want to feel loved? i guess so becuz everyone seems to want to leave me in the dirt. 

Jill is all upset and shit well fuck it its my fucking birthday and she thinks shes upset, she invited her own friends and i couldnt get ahold of dustin to coem with me becuz he was somewhere, dont know where, and none of my friends came, my only friends were sonia and kenny and well sonia's boyfriend was cool, he didnt try to make me feel like shit. all she wants is fuckin attention, well fuck it, stop trying to get people's attention jill and just be yourself instead of tryin to out do me. like i was drinkin all night and jill had ""fake shots"" me and sonia didnt want her drunk due to the last time she was so sonia kept givin her drinks with water in them and she thinks shes tipsy and stoned. whatever she had 3 hits off of a bowl, shes fine. i ddint have any but sonia kept givin me more and more drinks and the guys gave me more, so yeah. im the messed up one but im fine though, i can do everything fine. 

well im out, no one cares, so fuck it. no one comment alright, doesnt seem like u guys care so oh well.

HIGHLIGHT OF MY DAY: GETTING TO SEE NEIL! HES FUCKING AWESOME! I WANT TO HANG WITH HIM! I THINK SEEING NEIL AND TALKIN TO HIM MADE MY DAY BECUZ HE ACTUALLY SEEMED LIKE HE CARED TO TALK TO ME, EVERYONE JUST SCARED ME AND WELL I DONT KNOW . . . . except neva, i love you neva!"

Friday night after the stupid football game I went ot spend time with Nate but it didn't seem like he wanted to be with me, he somewhat ignored me. Saturday was the all day band thing nad that sucked majorly and after that I went home to the bitch. On the way home fro mthe band thing I found out that all my mom says about me to her friends and the family is nothing but bad things about me. Then sunday I went with Jill to her boyfriend's house and met Dustin and his friend Erik. Erik is cool but werid. Well Jill got a phone call from Nate saying him and her had to talk and to bring me. I got scared becuz I knew what it as so I made Jill ride a bike up to the skatepark where he was and I was walking there slowly with Dustin, Erik, Crystal, and my sister Amber. Next thing you know you see Jill coming flying past me pissed as fuck. I knew it. She told me what he said and I went into depressed mode. Erik and Dustin went to go and talk to him and they came back unharmed, thank god. 

why must I always fall for the ones that I know that will just hurt me in the end. there have been three guys in my life that made my life worth living, only one though I fell in love with. I starting to fall in love with Nate but now it is no more. Tater gave me a hug ot try and cheer me and Cliff told me to just say I'm dating the owner of a tatoo place but I told him he was too old. They let me chill there for a while. They are so cool. Tater is going to pierce my belly button when I turn 16. Which I will be in 3 weeks. 

well I'm out, I'm tired of crying and im tried of being hurt all the damn time by everyone except for a selected few. I'm leaving pretty soon, not sure yet, but soon."

Well she told my mom and my mom got in a pissy mood and started ot yell at me and Jill and then kept looking at me saying ""Where are the smokes Savana?"" Eventually I took the blame because Jill is going through a rough time and shes needs to be out of the house ot be ok. Well When I tried ot take a shower last night my mom kept walking in on me, 3 times she did it, she thought i was smoking, and at one point she goes ""I smell smoke, where is it savana?"" I told her ot get out of the bathroom I'm trying ot take a shower. I wasn't even smoking but she thought I was. So she grounded me becaus she thought she smelled smoke. I guess she forgot she smokes too and she just had a smoke in her hand when she walked in. I felt so fucking violated when she kept walking in on me in the bathroom. Next time she does that I'm going to lose it, shes gonna regret it. I took the blame for something I didn't do to be nice because I didn't care if I got in trouble, I cleaned my house spotless, did laundry and now im ungrounded but then I got grounded again because my mom thought she smelled smoke while I was taking a shower! Fuck her! Fuck her! Fuck my whole god damn family. I love Jill to death and that's it! everyone else. Go burn in hell!

Well it's offical as soon as I get my fucking car running I'm leaving my fucking house. I'm fed up with them. My parents think I'm the worse kid there is, my brother doesn't pay any attention to me, my little sister gaby keeps getting me in trouble for things I dont do, and my other sister amber i love her to death but she wants me to get in trouble, she thinks everything I do is wrong and that I should be punished for everything when she does half the shit I do too. Fuck this family. Fuck everything. Even my god damn friends are leaving me. I have no one and no on fucking cares. AHHHH!

I'm out and hopefully get in a good mood oh wait I can't I'm going home to the biggest bitch alive, my mom. I have ot clean her room, my little sister gaby's room, and mine and also I gotta clean all the bathrooms in order to be ungrounded.

The death of matt of not cool at all. He was friends with Nate and Jill knew hi, pretty well too. They both cried and I cried when we found out the news. What a dangerous thing to do. Drinking and driving is not what you want to do, it kills and injures people you know or dont know. 

its funny on how people could know people and don't relise how much they care about someone until they are gone, i never knew him but I know if I lost someone who I knew I would just want to shoot myself. Damien has several accounts on him from what I heard, he is being charged for underage drinking, drinking and driving, and murder. I hope he learns his lesson, I dont now if they were friends but he deserves to get punished for what he did.

i've been with nate a lot. i love him so much. i was with him today. it was funny actually because him and todd wanted to go skateboarding and it was dark so we went and they could hardly see so it was funny watching them fall on there asses. then we left and messed around in front of Cici's pizza. we were waitin for Jill to get off work. oh man Todd and Nate are going to be makin a jackass movie, the shit they do is so hilarious. you guys would be rolling if you see what they do. Todd really hurt himself though but he just got up and walked it off. sucha tough guy! lol

well besides the fact that my mom is a bitch. im getting sick again. well im in a lot of pain so i try to just lay down and that just makes it worse. i got cheered up though. Nate came over last night after he got done with work and stayed by me til midnight. he made me feel better. i love him so.

my throat is swollen
my glands are sticking out so far that they are even with my face

"event","omg im getting fucking sick again. damn it. the stupid thing is its only my right side of my thorat that is severely swollowen. The left side is fine but damn the pain is shooting right up to my ear and my face. my right cheek is starting to go numb. how i hate this, i wish i werent alive. maybe the reason im getting so sick is because no one likes me.

i have 5 or 6 people who i can count as my real friends. the rest just shut me out, like my family. oh well. can't control that. life goes on . . . 

well im sittin here holding ice to my neck to try and see if the swelling will go down because medicine dont work for me and neither do pain killers.

well i spent all day with my man (lol). i love him so. he actually puts up with my mom. go him. i cant even be in the same room with her more then 3 mins without fighting with her. then again he has to be nice in order for my mom to let him come over. lets see he came to my house and we ate dinner there and then he took me to Cici's pizza to eat there and then later around 10 he took me, jill, sonya, and todd to denny's. so i had 3 dinners. how crazy. then we watched a movie at my house and he iddnt leave til like 1am. oh well. he tried to make my throat feel better. how sweet

well im out. peace all. good night"

lately my days have been very bad but i always get happy. I got rid of that stupid fucker named matt who i was dating. appartently he used me and i want to kick his ass so bad. I have new boyfriend now. hehe his name is nate. im so happy with him. for once i think i can say that. i mean i was happy before once but im happy once again. 

well i walked up to Cici's pizza yesterday because me and jill were waiting for Nate to get off work so we can hang. While we were waiting they fed me free food. yay! i always get free food there just becuz everyone i know works there. so yay! Nate finally got off work and went to his house for while and picked up his ""brother"" todd (TJ). Then we headed to the skatepark. After the skatepark we went to his house to watch the football game and then headed to my house to have a fire. something very bad happened at my house but its all good now, the person is ok.

well i finally found out how my mom feels about me. She told me stright up to my face in front of my entire ""family"". And then she did it again while my friends were over. In basic terms to make it easy she things im SHIT, SELFISH, AND A WASTE OF TIME! i started to ball my eyes out. i ran out of my house and into my woods. Jill let me cry on her. If it wasnt for Jill i dont think i would be here right now. shes everything to me right now. I know i used to hate her but we had a very long talk and since then we ere best friends, more then best friends. we stick up for each other and do everything possiable to make each other. like last night i kept crying because my throat hurt so bad so Jill kept wakin up and trying ot make me feel better. 

well im out! I love you all. COMMENT FOOLS! LOL"

"event","my day had its way downs and its little ups.
i went for a walk and headed towards jake's house but no one would answered the door so i walked again to the skate park. i hung out with some people. they were cool.

there is this little 11 year old that is wicked awesome. he was better then like a lot of people. haha and this other kid had like duck tape all over his board because it was falling apart ((i think he needs a new board . . haha))

then my sister, donna, and my cousin came to the skate park and we hung there for a few hours. it was grand but yet it was bad because my stupid little sister and my cousin wouldnt leave and i wanted thme to because they were being annoying as fuck. we eventually left.

i went home for a couple hours and called my boyfriend to see is he wanted to go to family days to watch the fireworks, he goes ""i dont feel like going anywhere"" so i go find and he says i got bitchy. ok fine whatever. i call him again and he was at the store getting something and i asked him one more time if he would please come up, he goes ""I REALLY DONT FEEL LIKE GOING ANYWHERE"" and then i said fine good bye. when earlier we were suppose to go ot the movies but never went. hmmm i do a bunch of shit for him but yet he cant even go to family days with me to watch the fireworks. hes startin to treat me like shit and im about to set him striaght.

we went to family days and i found brittany. BRITTANY YOU ARE THE GREATEST! YOU MADE ME HAPPY! she got a bunch of that glowy shit on my arms and i accidnetly swollowed the stuff. it tasted like shit. brittany got it all over her hands, she said it felt funny. hmmm well it started to down pour and it was fun. me and donna went running through the rain and after it stopped the firworks started and it was good. it calmed me down but yet made me sad. i always wanted to go see fireworks with my boyfriend. i think fireworks are romantic and totally awesome. but my boyfriend is being dumb.

well now im here and talking to brittany online. well im out!"

I spent the night over my boyfriends house and well at first it wasnt good because something was bothering him and he didnt want ot talk about it so later he went to work and I hung out with his bro and lil sis. they are awesome people. around 11:20 he gets back home and has his friend Chewy spend the night too. Chewy is cool. Well it was all good again. We played cards. I lost super badly, so badly it wasn't even funny. We were playing poker, and i will never play poker again with them because I swear they must cheat or something. well i stayed up til 6 in the morning with chewy, matt fell asleep around like 3 or 4. so it was all good. i woke around noon today and had to go home, as soon as i got home i slept and slept some more. haha fun stuff. now im sittin here with donna and donnie because matt is at work by now. hopefully my mom will let me go outside.

everyone is leavin for band camp and im not allowed to go because my mom said no because i was sick. have fun everyone! enjoy!

Neva I am your friend too. I never said anything bad about you behind your back, I think your wicked cool. People are physco, they always are.

<P><EM><FONT size=2>thursday night i spent the night at my boyfriends house. me and him laid in his bed for 3 hours watching movies. he eventually fell asleep because his mom gave him sleeping pills because he hurt his knee on the trampalene. i went upstairs to go to sleep. i woke up and my throat was hurting and i iwas a little light headed. i didint think anything of it so me and my boyfriend sat on the couch and watched TV and ate breakfast. eventually he had to leave fore work and me and his sister went to the car show. well when i was at the car show i started to feel really bad. i called my mom ot come nad pick me up. by the time we&nbsp;got home it slammed me, hard. &nbsp;i got out of the car and couldnt even walk. i was beat red. Jill and donna (boyfriend's sis) helped into the hosue and sat me down. i was beat red, high fever, throat swollen, severely light headed, couldnt e een move, weak. everything. my aunt comes over and she goes its no big deal just lay her down in bed and take her to the doctor in the morning. my mom goes ok so i try to get up but lose my balance nad fall so my sister and donna had to help me up the stairs. they lay me down in bed. i wake up and my dad gets home and looks at me and goes ""WHY DIDNT YOU GUYS TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL LAST NIGHT??"" my mom just looked at him. so they took me to the doctors. my dad had to carry me because i couldnt walk. i get inside and the doctor takes one look at me and just goes ""take her ot the hosptial."" so they take me ot the hosptial. </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT size=2>at the hospital: they take me right away and put me in a ER room. they do all the normal stuff and my temp was 102.7. i guess that is bad. they hook me up to a iv and that hurt like a bitch because they screwed up. well then they drew blood from me. after that i got a catscan. 3 hours later i got all the results back and they said everything was neg. but i was really sick and they wanted to fin out what was wrong with me so they saids they were goin to give me a spinal tap. well the told me i was goin to be asleep for it but they lied. i was wide awake and felt all 8 long ass needles go into my back. they messed up, just let you know. so my mom comes running in because she hears me screaming and crying and tells them to stop. they stop and take me me up to my new room. i wake up to 3 nurses and&nbsp; a doctor. they told i wasnt allowed ot eat and that i wwas severely sick. (NO DUH!) &nbsp;so i could hardly talk now, i couldn't move, it hrt to swollow and i was starving. saturday came along and i was still in the hosptial they&nbsp;now said i could eat but only liquids. so basically chicken brooth. gross shit. they also told me during the night i was sweating and my temp. got as high as 104. so they put ice on me and a wet cloth and the blankets off of me. the brougt my tem,p down to 102. so they said that was good enough. then they basically just kkept me on the iv thingy and gave me medicine through it all weekend and i left today. (sunday). they told me im not allowed to eat hard food and it must be soft because the back of my throat is still swollen. so im not goin to band camp! or band all week. or ANYWHERE! but people are gonna come here.</FONT></EM></P>

<P>i met this guy named christopher. i know i have a boyfriend and all but there is something really different about this kid i met. he lives in geneva. i met him once last year and fell for him. i saw him again yesterday and the day before. we hung out and oh man, it just felt so i dont know how to put it. he actualy listens to me and tells me he likes me. hes not one of those guys who just meet girls to have sex or just like make put and leave. no this one likes to talk and play games and shit and listen ot me and i listen to him. i think im falling for him and i dont want to. im going ot be breaking up with my boyfriend shortly but god i dont want to get hurt. even though i really like him. when i was dancing with him (a slow song) i felt like i could be there forever. i didnt want to leave from that spot. it was like heaven. after the song he gave me a great big hug and his mom made him leave because it was like an hour and half drive back to his house so yeah. </P>
<P>Brittany your a crazy one, all them guys who like you. your just hot stuff there. lol </P>

Came home from camp got into a fight with my folks and then found out that I have 2 growths in my knee and so now i have to go get a bunch of cat scans and x-rays of it to see how bad they are. what fun huh. Hospitals are stupid I swear. Then I went on a walk wiyj Tiffany but no one was home so I said fuck it and came home. I hate this soo much! 

Sitting here at my house all alone it feels like. Even though there are 2 other people here I feel all alone. No one here to hold me or talk to me. I miss the ones I love but I don't know what to do anymore. I miss everything that was good to me but eveything that was good turned into something bad. I never had the perfect thing that would last. It's always been like something evil and horriable and at the end I cry because I get all depressed and sad because nothing goes right for me. Its all evil. People think they understand and they say they will always be there for me but they lie. They say it to make them look good. I wish I could run away and disappear forever. To a place where no one has never heard of and start a new life there. To leave my horriable past behind and start a new. So much pain if built into me and so much stress I cant take it anymore. I'm always cring and i wish i weren't. The tears constantly falling making me sad just hurt more and more. I wanna hurt myself but would good would that do, nothing. I feel so rotten and ugly. So much things bottled up inside of me making me decay and hoping to die. I hardly eat now. All I do is walk and walk and walk. I wish I could be happy, is that so hard. I guess so.

I wish someone would cheer me up but no one comes here, no one sees me. I'm not that important to anymore so oh well. I guess I'll just be alone and be all by myself. oh well is what i say.

I kept getting into fights with my mom and dad. I would just walk off. I hung out with this kid named James the whole time. Him and his family made me feel better. They made me happy. 

I've been soo depressed lately. I hate it. I dont understand. I feel like no one appeciates me or anything. I try so hard to be nice and see everyone but it never works. I never get what no matter how hard I try. It just keeps going down hill. I have soo much stuff built up inside of me and I cant take it anymore. I just wanan buckle down and cry. I can't wait til my 16th birthday when I get my car. I'm leaving this shitty town. I have somewhere to live too. I just need a car to get there. No one will miss me. so yeah. I think only a couple of people care about me and that Brittany and my friend James at camp. It's funny how things happen.

How they have to steal things from me and lie and tell them everything I say. Well Fuck you all who has done it! I try so fucking hard to be nice and not hurt people. I try so fucking hard not to be mean and not be rude. But people still find a way to make me feel like shit. Telling what to do and telling me what I can't do. I have to be the most responsiable person in my god damn house but no one fucking wants me too so they try to push me to the limit. Well fuck them and their little lives. The only good thing that happened today was that I quit my job. Sure I won't have a job for a while but I don't care. </EM></P>
<P><EM>I want to die. I'm leaving for a week or two for camp and I""m not going ot be able to see anyone. No one is going to miss because no one fucking loves me.

It will be the best day of my life. well I'm out.</EM></P>

"event","Today was interesting! Brittany came over and me and her and jill walked to stacies house. What a fun that was walking our fat asses thre. haha We know how Frogger feels like now. haha

After that we went to Dunkin Donuts and forced Brittany to have some ice cream. By this time Jill has left us because I told her to leave and go to John's because I wanted to hang with Brittany and Stacie. Later on in the day After being stalked by lil kids lol. We went to the china place ot eat. Let me tell ya Chop Sticks are funny.

I fnally learned how to use chop sticks but Brittany Stacie well that was a different story. haha I told them ""Just stab the food with it and eat it before it slides off."" lol What great fun. I tried to show them how to use them but it just wasnt good enough. haha

Well went around the block when we left and saw George and his cousin we stopped them and they went with us to the skate park because I had to go there to meet Jill up there. We got there and I didnt even go near Jill until George and his cousin left. Hung out with her and then I got a ride by some strange guy to the greens and then walked to stacie's from there. 

Well me and Stacie decide to pay Jake a visit. He's sooo cool. Wish I could hang out with him a lot more. Hes the greatest. haha Went back to Stacie's and grabbed her. We decide to walk ot Jessica Kotecki's house. Before we left we grabbed a few eggs. lol You can figure out what we did with them in your own head. haha Eggs are a funny thing at night when they land and leave egg stuff all over. haha

We get to Jessica and got a ride back to my house. So now I have Stacie and Jessica spending the night. The funny thing is I could of been out later because my brother told me midnight but he aint even home yet. So we are doing whatever the fuck we want to so its fun. TOday had to be a blast. I got to see people, hang out with the coolest people in the world and met some new people. what fun. 

You know how they tell you not to get in cars with strangers . . . well I don't listen. I hopped into a car with this kid named Brandon who likes to jack off every night and says I flash a guy who is invisbale every night. What a strange kid. oh well. I didnt have to walk did I. haha no!

"event","Today had to be the best day of my summer. My day went from shitty to awesome in the matter of one day. yeah! Shall I recap. 

Brittany came over today and we decided to go on a walk. We got a ride to tops and walked from there. On the way to George's house there were these 3 guys riding bikes and they were stalking me and Brittany asking us questions. They told Brittany she had a nice ass! haha. We walked to george's hosue to stop by and say hi. Chris and Pitts were there. It was cool. George is a clean freak. Later while we were there Steve came and picked them up and we left. Apparently he got stung by a bee. Well when they left we went to Stacie's house but no one would answer, we just stood there and kept callin her name but she wouldn't respond so we left to go to Neva's house well we stook a pit stop at Amy's house because Brittany wanted to see her. So we did. Later we walked to Neva's house and got lost. We were in the wrong circle. haha. We eventually found her house and went in. Neva is cool. She gave us like a tour of her house. Bam is hott!! haha We went outside and the newspaper guy was out there. Kyle Gotshcall, with him was Neil and some other guy. They started to throw newspapers at neva and then at us. It was the attack of the killer newspapers. Then they took all the newspapers back and wouldnt give one to Neva. Neva goes ""where's my paper?"" So they spun back around and threw the paper at the middle of the circle. Poor Neva she got the torn paper. Well me and Britt had to go back to my house and it was like a 2 hour walk so Neva offered us a ride home. Thank you Neva, we appeciate it but we are sorry if you got in trouble for us being there. We are sorry. We love you. Well we got back ot my hosue and watched a movie. Then she left. 

It was a wicked cool day! I've been soo down because I've had a shitty summer but I had an awesome day. yeah! Also got ot see someone I wanted to see in a long time. go me! well I'm out. I'll update later!

I LOVE YOU NEVA!! YOUR THE GREATEST!! YOU ARE TOO BRITTANY!! THANKS FOR MAKING MY DAY FUN!!!"

I have to run tomorrow and I don't want to. My knee hurts so bad! I fucked it up. I got some x-rays of it but I won't get the results until like 3 days. I think Tuesday after I'm done running the damn 24 relay thing I might walk up to the greens and say hi to everyone. 

Well Friday was aweful. My parents got into a fight and some how it involed me. They kept screaming and yelling about me and how everything wasn't right. I got so upset that I just up and left. I walked to my aunt's because I had no shoes on and it was the shortest distance. I was so upset. I wanted to walk to someone's house but I didn't think he was home. It was aweful. They used the word 'divorce' and other stuff. I really don't want to say anything else.

Sittign here with all my problems. My mom is in bed rest because she just had surgery and nothing is going well. Shes in constant pain and no one is able to help her. The hospital has done all they could do for her and no one can help her anymore. She had this disease since i was 4 years old and it keeps gettign worse. She cant have anymore help on her. All they can give her is stronger and stronger pain killers. The pain killers drug her up and then she gets all bitchy and gets pissed at me for no reason. She treats me like shit nad stuff but treats Jill like shes the best child in the world. She thinks Jill can do no wrong. Jill is a sex-o-holic, smokes, drinks, does drugs, always getting me into trouble. Trying ot sneak around. Yelling at my sisters trying to make them feel sorry for her. I'm tired of this. Shes gotta learn things are better now and that she should just grow and learn that nothing is going to go good for her if she keeps this shit up. I will kick her ass if she keeps doing this shit. I'm a good girl. I don't smoke, I don't do drugs, I don't drink, and I DIFFENTLY DON'T CHEAT ON MY BOYFRIENDS LIKE SHE DOES!! I'm tired of this. Too many people are looking into my past and wont get out. Non-stop with the past. saying things like 'oh your goning ot get hooked back up with george again."" and i just say no because because me and him are not. me and hm are friends nad i wish people would relise that. another thign people will say ""your a bad kid, stop lying."" or ""your no angel"" or ""you always cheat on your boyfriends"". I'm sorry but I dont cheat on my boyfriends, i never have and never will. I don't believe in cheating, i dont think its right. I never have. I wish people would relise that but they don't. Yeah we are young but we are not stupid!!! Sometimes I wish people would stop saying the word love. THey don't know what the word love means. They never will. I know what love is because I feel it for someone right now and i always will. Even though me and him are not together anymore and are just friends now doesnt mean i dont feel the same way i do for him the very first day me and him kissed. I love hi mand i alwasy will but right now we are just friends. I love him but he doesnt love me so that means we are friends. it hurts me to see him with other girls but what am i suppose to do? nothing. I just help him. thats all. I miss shaun a lot, i don't love him, i just like him a lot. He made me happy and treated me soo well and i dont understand why he had to go and beleive those stories about me. They weren't true. They will never be true. God. I wish he would just relise that. I miss him soo much. I have too much stress on myself. I""m always constantly coming home cleaning my house, taking care of my mom and family. Doing laundry and on top of that i have a job that im the best worker there and only gettin paid $5 an hour. Also I'm trying ot see my friends but it is so hard. When i was in school I tried my best to keep my grades up. I could of done better but I didnt because I had too mcuh on my mind. I wish I could help myself because a more better person. People tell me i shouldn't be trusted and that im useless. My parents tell me I'm a useless son of a bitch and that im lazy. They say they cant trust me because they say im too comfortable around guys and that they know me. They say i do things with guys. They think i have sex and i dont. I'm a fucking virgin. All these bad thoughts in my head are not helping me. I'm constantly helping my friends and making them happy tryin to be there for their every move, every tear. I want to make everyone happy but its just sooo hard. I appeciate all my friends trying to make me happy and they do a great job but it doesnt get rid of my problems. I'm tired of all the lies and im tired of all of this stress. I just want to die. I'm an emoitional person and I can't take this. I didnt have the best child hood growing up because  didn't have many friends, I was a loner but now i have friends but my friends keep stabbing m in the back except for some. Thank you for the ones who didnt. All this stress and all these tears will be stopping soon because soon i wont be here anymore. Until then I will keep crying until I'm truely happy again like i was before but until then. Good bye.

well that was just some of my stress but the rest you dont want to know and i hope you never know. I don't want anyone's help. I know I ask for it but I don't want it. I want to become a stronger person and by doing that I need to be independent so thanks for everything guys but so now on I'm independent. Thanks for everything. 

Remeber I'm here for all you guys, if you ever need someone to talk to or need someone to cry on I'm only a call away. I'm here for everyone amd I want to help you all. I love you all.

[Disclaimer: LOTS of spoilers for Tsukihime for those who still haven't played it or don't want to know what happens.]

<lj-cut text=""Why app Kohaku in the first place? Aka: Kohaku Panic!"">
So.

I was in living in Japan as an exchange student, December of 2005.  I had three characters at cfud, Bob the Angry Flower, and Uotani Arisa and Sohma Yuki from Furuba, I was on a big Fruits Basket kick.

Meanwhile, I managed to meet <lj user=""constant_craver""> and we made a round of the various shops, restaurants, and Game Centers.  Game Centers being like arcades in America, but have the advantage of: 1. GOOD variety of games, and 2. Relative cheap costs. (About 30 cents a pop, 75 cents if you're unlucky. XD)

And, one of the first games pointed out to me was this relatively recent release: <i>Melty Blood.</i>  A fighting game based on a hentai game I had heard of but knew nothing about, with about 14 good balanced characters.  We played for a bit where I got beat rather badly.

And, one 'character' really stood out to me: a tag-team of two twin maids.  One trying very hard to look proper in a western Maid dress (Hisui), and one looking rather cheerful and upbeat (Kohaku).  They stood out because I had discussed the possibility of a Fruits Basket based fighting game with <lj user=""constant_craver"">, and how if Honda Tohru was a character, all of her 'attacks' would have to be using items related to cleaning and cooking, and they'd have to do little to no damage. And, that was basically what summed up the attacks of the two maid sisters.  Hisui and Kohaku both fought wielding feather-dusters, cooking instruments, and a broom-stick.  (A demonstration of these can be found <a href=""http://k53t.hp.infoseek.co.jp/"">here</a>.  Or just do a search on youtube for ""Melty Blood,"" you'll find lots. XD)

THEN it was that <lj user=""constant_craver""> let me in on the twist revolving around the maids: ""The cheerful one is actually emotionless and sorta-evil.  The other quiet one is actually good and has emotions.""

First thing I got back to my then 'home' was to look up everything I could find about Tsukihime and Melty Blood, which was really, at the time, very little.  All I could find was: ""...in a twist of irony, it is actually Hisui who has emotions and Kohaku who is emotionless.  Hisui buries her emotions, while Kohaku's emotions are broken, her smiles all facades.""

A good round of buying up doujin and <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/max3075/top.htm"">web site</a> searching later, I knew basically the entire plot proper. And I realized that all of the people I had on my list of possible apps were either: 1. Smiling, evil assassins with broken emotions (Seta Soujirou, from RuroKen), 2. Cute girls who were hiding the fact they were evil beneath a facade of cuteness (Momo from Project Justice/Rival Schools), or people who were just either cute or evil in general.

Then I realized: ""Kohaku fits all of the basic archetypes of everyone I was considering apping... I'll never run out of ideas for her! She's three basic types of characters in one! :O!""

AND, I worked on the app, probably the hardest I EVER have.  And got in. Hooray. XD
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Kohaku&#39;s Development at Camp, the early days vs. now."">
When Kohaku first got to camp, she was a little more openly crazy.  She cooked Bad Things for people, poisoned or outright killed one or two, and was generally pinging everyone's ""weird"" radar without doing anything outright suspicious or dangerous.  Meanwhile, I was buying and reading a lot of doujin for more random ideas.

Overall, playing her hasn't changed *too* much. The biggest difference is that: in the early days, Kohaku was alone.  No one knew her, no one trusted her more than you would normally trust a cute girl, and she did not really have a reason to show her evil side.  The only one who 'found out' her facade were Death and Delirium, and no one else really got close.

Thus, early at camp? Kohaku was DESPERATE to get close to people, for her own safety, and the possibility of manipulating them.  Though Kohaku was a lone-canoner, one of her main considerations has always been that Tohno Akiha, her mistress, close friend/confidant, and target of revenge, would come to camp.  When that happened, she would have to return to being a Tohno Family maid, not a character who made fake-smiles and waited on people to keep busy, but as someone with real obligations, and someone who would really test her deception skills again.  Before that happened, she would need to know everything she could about camp and have some allies to fall back on.

One of the first people that caught her eye was <lj user=""as_apple_pie"">. Light had been playing the ""I'm perfectly nice and normal :)"" card a lot, and then when Light bit at an opportunity to use her, Kohaku pulled a SWITCHAROO on Light and made him her boyfriend, both took away the general impression they'd be able to use the other somehow, maybe.

Some other notable relationships were Kohaku with the Mess Hall people, especially Minagawa and convincing Izumi to let her onto the normal staff.  When Jun (from Minagawa's canon) also showed up at camp, there was a fun bit where he sent her to the hospital, which somehow became a very good ice breaker for them both.

But, time passed, Jun and Light both left camp, and Kohaku's most stable position was as a camp cook.  Seta Soujirou eventually came to camp as well, and they entered a (sorta) similar relationship of both trying to use the other, the main difference with the Kohaku/Light thing being that it never approached anything 'romantic,' and they both figured out their 'true natures'. (Or at least, Kohaku presented another view of herself beyond as a cute maid, for those reading ahead.)

But the real turning point was...
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""The real turning point! Old sisters and new sisters!"">
About half a year ago as of this writing, in mid-November or so, Kohaku's twin sister Hisui entered camp.  Suddenly, Kohaku's whole outlook on camp begins to change.

First, Hisui indirectly informs Kohaku that time was not passing normally for them, meaning Hisui had <i>not</i> been stuck all alone in a mansion for several months, and one angry mistress and worried male protagonist were not wondering where she was.  Kohaku's first reaction was to play this off as ""Oh, I just arrived too! Where are we?"", which she managed to maintain for a little while. It also meant that Kohaku had a *real* objective she could dedicate herself to: ""Protect Hisui-chan.""

Meanwhile, through coincidence, and a lot of thread jumping, Kohaku formed a relationship with cute younger pink-haired girl: Anita King.  Though at first the relationship was purely to reinforce her status as a 'cute, older-sister' type, eventually it was revealed Anita-chan had powers of her own: the ability to control and manipulate paper.  And then when she (AND Minagawa-sama) demonstrated she(/they) was(/were) willing to protect Kohaku when she was attacked by Kunou-as-Happosai...

Kohaku knew, even if an angry Akiha-sama were to appear at camp, she would not suddenly disappear into the night.  She had two people who would willingly fight for her while she could maintain her aura of innocence, and this was reinforced even more when Kohaku made Anita her 'third sister'.  Meanwhile, though camp was becoming more and more crowded, Hisui-chan would also be there for her, both as support, and as her mirror-image who would absorb all of the normal 'suspicion'.  One girl claiming to be a maid and focusing on maid-like duties might ping a normal person's ""something's off"" sense, but with Hisui who was even more dedicated, not so much.

Light-san's return also surprised Kohaku in that it was not like Kyon's; when Kyon came back, he didn't remember anything, and their relationship didn't move past a first meeting.  So when Light came back remembering all of camp, Kohaku was a little pressed at what to do.  On the one hand, she now had people who could protect her, but on the other hand... what would Light think if she didn't act as forward as she had been?  Ultimately, she moved to re-initiate the relationship, the main factor in her decision being: ""It's what a cute dedicated maid would do...""
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""And, a slight player/meta note:"">
One thing that also affected how I played Kohaku was that around December of 2006, I finally got the chance to play the original Tsukihime game myself.  Though I already knew the entire plot, there were more than a few details I wasn't clear about.  That and the anime and manga, while providing interesting points (the latter more than the former), did not really expand on Kohaku more than what I already knew.

But the game? Oh, it made everything *really* clear. All of a sudden, I have canon references for how Kohaku would react to almost any situation, relevant to her 'true nature' or not, as well as even little mundane details like: ""What type of cooking is Kohaku best/worst at?""  And the not so minor detail of: ""What DO Kohaku's drugs do and how does she get people to take them?""  I was actually glad to learn a lot of what I had been working out about her and what I had guessed at was actually right, with maybe one or two discrepancies. (One discrepancy being: Kohaku never hated anyone in the Tohno family, not even Tohno Makihisa who personally raped her practically every single day of her life from when she was eight onwards. I had always assumed that she DID hate him and that her indirect killing of him was very personal, but I digress.)
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Everything you wanted to know about Kohaku in chronological, bite-sized bits."">
1. Kohaku and Hisui were both orphans, adopted by the Tohno family at an early age and set to work to become maids.  Kohaku was the older sister, and rather shy. She stated about herself later: ""I never understood why people smiled, or frowned, or could ever discover the meaning behind it.""
2. Kohaku is at some point, designated to become 'used' by Tohno Makihisa so he can stave off his own dehumanization with her power.  He knows he's going to destroy her utterly, but knows he will go insane if he doesn't.  This culminates with him raping her on her eighth birthday.
3. Hisui remains energetic and cheerful, and Kohaku becomes more and more distant.  It's unknown if they ever even talk to each other.
4. Nanaya Shiki is brought to the house.  Kohaku watches him from the window of Makihisa's room, but never actually meets him. She feels a certain emotion looking at him and his silent invitation to come out and play when he watches her at the window.  This changes when Kohaku watches Shiki save Tohno Akiha's life by protecting her from Tohno SHIKI and getting killed in the process. Surprisingly, her emotion now is one of hate directed towards him.  She later states: ""I don't know... I guess I was just taking it out on someone.  But I watched that boy, who lost everything to this family, protect this girl who was not at all related to him, and I wondered: ""Why did he do that?""  Why... was there someone he valued more than his own life? But if he could do that... why didn't he ever help me? Why was I surrounded by evil people? Why couldn't they have been kind, like that boy?""
5. Without knowing why, Kohaku met Shiki and gave him one of her only possessions: a white ribbon. She makes him promise to give it back to her, indirectly begging him: ""Please come back.""
6. Hisui and Kohaku's personality switches are almost complete: Kohaku has lost all sense of her inner self from going through her torture every day, losing herself in the delusion that ""I'm a doll... so I don't feel pain or have any other human concerns. I can become whatever I want if I wear the right clothes and act the right way.""  Meanwhile, young-Hisui (appeared to) have the type of personality that wanted to be happy, even if something was potentially wrong.  But, when she finally learns the truth about what her sister is going through, as well as watching one of her best friends die in front of her, she becomes depressed and horribly lonely.
7. Kohaku tells Hisui: ""Don't worry, Hisui-chan.  I'll take over your role for now.  I'll give it back when you can be cheerful again.""  This <i>frightens</i> Hisui, who thinks she should shake off her emo immediately, but she sees Kohaku doing her chores, acting very cheerful and happy.  She recognizes it's an act, but also observes that getting to act out the role and be cheerful is bringing her some happiness, so she doesn't have either the heart or the will to go back.

This makes clear Kohaku's primary motivation: she's a schemer, but she also is someone who genuinely wants to have fun with people, and be happy.  She herself feels she's lost the ability to know what happiness is, but acting it out makes her feel better in some little way.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Previous thread summation. Aka: Why Kohaku is the real main character of Tsukihime."">
The game makes it clear when you complete her story: Kohaku is a 'propman'.  Shiki experiences horrible dreams and visions throughout all of the story branches of Tsukihime, and they can all be traced somehow back to Kohaku.  In fact, the entire reason the story even begins is the result of Kohaku's doing.  Shiki comes back to the mansion because his 'father' Tohno Makihisa died.  And a killer stalks the streets at night, filling the role of the 'main villain' of the story.  BOTH of these crucial plot points, regardless of the route you take, are the result of Kohaku's actions.  She is, essentially, why the story even happens in the first place.

Yet at the same time, she's not really a villain.  Or at least not a villain like the rest of the villains in Tsukihime are villains. She doesn't attack people who are weaker than her, she doesn't even WANT to do anything she has been doing.  She makes it very clear: ""I felt nothing towards Makihisa, nor did I hate the Tohno children.  But I had to do something... so I thought: 'What would a normal person do in this situation?'""  Meaning, revenge, to Kohaku, was not personal, or vindictive, but another role for her to play, as much as being kind to people and laughing with them was.  In this sense, no one at camp has really seen her 'true self...' even Soujirou who she admitted: ""Hiding behind a guise of innocence... I intend to take revenge, or die trying.""
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Lengths Kohaku will go, and not go, to accomplish her goals."">
Kohaku has a few basic boundaries when it comes to what she will do.  But also has some concerning what she won't do.
Most obvious is regarding Hisui-chan.  Kohaku suffered in Hisui-chan's place, so if Hisui was to become 'dirty', all of it will have been for nothing.  It's implied in canon (and most doujin have it as fanon,) that when Kohaku let's Tohno SHIKI out on the town to kill, she requests he not harm Hisui.  This is also evident in the Hisui True Ending: when Kohaku confesses she is responsible for everything, she's the reason the entire family killed each other, she adds: ""Oh, but Hisui-chan never knew anything, so don't worry.  She was clean until the end.""

The EXCEPTION to this, is that Kohaku does implicitly manipulate Hisui as a means of protecting her own secret when she still needed to.  When Shiki first returns to the mansion, he is not sure if Hisui was the original owner of the white ribbon.  In the Kohaku path, Hisui is able to answer some questions Shiki asks her regarding it... but the only way she would know would be if Kohaku told her. Furthermore, there are times when Kohaku will impersonate Hisui to either feed Shiki medicine, or lead him somewhere without drawing suspicion to herself. Thus, though Kohaku will readily take advantage of Hisui indirectly, there is a clear line between what Kohaku will and won't do.  If it would potentially traumatize or make Hisui appear to be 'corrupt', it's out of the question.  But temporary, minor things that only serve to misdirect are fine.

Another interesting thing about Kohaku: she has almost no regard for her own life. She kills herself with hardly a thought, piercing her heart with a knife, and calmly states she's neither sad nor afraid.  Nor does she try to dodge when someone tries to attack her after her plans all come together.  She will lie and manipulate and do whatever she must to bring her revenge about and delay suspicion of her, but ultimately?  If someone threatened her life, she would not truly care about death <i>in and of itself</i>, but only sofar it'd prevent her from accomplishing something.  This similarly applies to threats of pain: pain is nothing to Kohaku, and she doesn't even feel it.  This is to the point Shiki has to tell her to go bandage herself when she cuts herself cooking so badly that blood is flowing freely.

(I'm emphasizing this last point more for camp than to make a canon point: <i>threatening Kohaku with death or torture will not work.</i> Not just because of the moogles, but because she doesn't view herself as a 'living thing' anymore.)

Other than this, Kohaku has no basic qualms about doing anything to accomplish her goals. Kill people, poison people, drug people, betray those who love or are otherwise close to her... She won't be taunting people about how she betrayed them, but if it'll help her, she'll do it.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""A note about the No Sex rule."">
The No Sex rule is both an immense blessing, and a bit of a limiter for Kohaku. On the one hand, it means she can't be used as she was at the mansion, even if Tohno SHIKI was to show up at camp, or someone was to discover what her power is.  But on the other, it means that if she did want to give someone her power, she'd have to either get them to suck her blood, or get them to receive it in another way.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Final note. Aka, Operation: Kohaku Panic."">
If we were to enter a cfud world where characters with hidden secrets have them all blabbed tomorrow, and camp somehow came to regard Kohaku as a deceiving, murderous person, then all would not be lost. Kohaku has one last plan if it ever comes to that: ordering Mecha-Hisui to grab her, and then drive them both straight into the barrier. An order she's programmed called: ""Operation: Kohaku Panic.""

Kohaku figures that either they would get through, or camp would hit her with a harsh 'status effect' as punishment, and either way she wouldn't have to think about it anymore. In terms of meta-planning though, it'd be an excuse for me to bring out Kohaku from Hisui's Good Ending: a Kohaku with... basically, amnesia. XD It'll probably never reach that point, but it does give me something to fall back on if it ever did."

<b>Goals:</b> I have a lot of IC goals!

Kohaku: Be more trusted in the mess hall.  Protect Hisui-chan from harm.  Gain/maintain the complete trust of Anita, Minagawa, and other people who would be open to helping her.  And finally, prepare for the arrival of Tohno Akiha to camp.  (Something she can do indefinitely, but, it'd be REALLY cool if someone apped Akiha. XD)

Nagato Yuki: Expand her 'network' of recruits.  Continue observing variou camp phenomenon. Above all, continue to monitor Suzumiya Haruhi and the one known as Kyon.

Bob the Angry Flower: WANT SOME <a href=""hxxp://www.angryflower.com/happin.html"">HAPPINESS?</a>

<b>Height:</b> 5' 1.4""  (156 cm)

<b>Notes for the Psychics:</b> If you have a character who can sense people's emotions, Kohaku should come off as very strange.  She exhibits no actual emotion at all, but she acts extremely cheery all the time.  And for other psychics, you may want to refer to some of my earlier posts about Kohaku's past.

<b>Cooking:</b> Kohaku is a very good cook! Professional level, even.  Her best style is French cooking, her worst is Chinese.

<b>OTHER NOTES:</b> When Kohaku is dressing up as Hisui, please do not just 'know' that she's actually Kohaku, not Hisui.  In the game, Kohaku is able to do it very well, and the only way to really know if it's Hisui or Kohaku is that Hisui refers to Kohaku as ""Nee-san,"" while Kohaku as Hisui refers to ""my sister"".  If your character can honestly put this together (I think the only way would be to spend a lot of time around Hisui AND Kohaku), or if your character is psychic/'spirit-sensing' in some way, then sure. Feel free to notice.  Just please don't yell about it publicly, tell random people, etc."

Looks: Short, but cute. Kohaku is pretty attractive for a maid.  This icon is her most ""fashioned up"" look. While not being completely flat, she doesn't have remarkable breasts either, really. (I'd guess, 30b?) 

Smarts: Kohaku has never been to any sort of formal education, but is still quite smart.  She's been trained as a doctor, and, of course, as a maid. She's a competent cook, but her household cleaning skills are lacking. It's said in canon that Kohaku's only allowed to clean the outside of the house, because if she cleaned the inside she'd only make a mess.  In terms of general intelligence, her mind is quite quick. She's always thinking of what type of impression she wants to leave a person with. 

Personality: Cute, sweet, and caring. &hearts;  At least, that's probably the personality anyone but Death and Delirium will ever get to know.  Kohaku has a side to her that's completely emotionless, with occasional flashes of rage. Even in the ending to her story where she starts to 'recover' and abandons her goal of revenge, she still says things like: ""I've been acting for so long... I don't know how to feel things for real. I might be acting even now.""  It takes her a while, but she is eventually able to smile from her heart, but that's a part of her buried deep deep down. Any marriage prospects would either have to deal with projected cute-personality Kohaku, or help her overcome her past.

Home Ec: I sorta dealt with this in the smarts section! XD  Kohaku's a very good cook.  She's able to make very complicated dishes all by herself.  Though, it is stated in canon she has some problem with Chinese dishes. (For no particular reason, apparently.)
But Kohaku is NOT good at housework. She will break things. A lot.

Combat Skills: Whoo boy... if I was going straight from Melty Blood continuity, Kohaku would be quite formidable on her own, but...

Kohaku does not try to get in direct combat with anyone and will only resort to it if she's truly desperate. (Kohaku will resort to it to protect her secrets, but NOT to protect her own life.) She has a sword hidden in her broom, which she knows how to use in a ""draw & slash"", assassin style-manner. Besides this, she has some at least preliminary knowledge of Kung Fu, but this is more for show when she's cosplaying.

Special Abilities: Kohaku is a ""thieving cat.""  Well, in Japanese, a ""thief cat"" means a cat who secretly enters a kitchen unheard, and eats all the food. But more metaphorically speaking: a person who does bad things secretly while assuming a state of innocence. Kohaku has been playing a game of hidden secrets and manipulation for a long time. Therefore, her best weapon is secretiveness and being able to be unassuming in the background, and her worst weak point is being singled out and suspected. Anyone who earns her attention (in a bad way) that doesn't watch her strictly or take her seriously will end up worse for wear... eventually.

In-laws: A very cute younger twin sister! Hisui-chan is the shy, distant one. Kohaku loves her dearly, and would die if anything happened to her. But at the same time, Hisui also enables Kohaku in a variety of ways.  Because Hisui knows, deep down, that Kohaku suffered in her place, she can't confront Kohaku about her ""act"". Furthermore, Kohaku at least subconsciously has to manipulate her sister as well, even if it's never in a bad way or that would harm her. Hisui just being there makes Kohaku look less suspicious in comparison.

Besides this, Kohaku has a former master in the form of Tohno Akiha, who is strict, cold, bossy, and wouldn't take kindly to her personal maid being married off, especially without her permission.  Beware.  Besides this, Kohaku has a secret ward who will never influence her at camp, she hopes beyond hope, and another person at her house: Tohno Shiki.

Competition: The aforementioned Tohno Shiki.  While he'd be just as likely to congratulate Kohaku and wish her all the best, it's possible Shiki has some buried feelings for Kohaku. Especially if he ever figured out the ""hidden personality"" part about her.

Finances: Kohaku does manage her own money as well as do shopping for the Tohno family, so it's assumed she's fairly competent with household economies. But Kohaku has no money.  She's a maid dependent on her family for room and board, and it's unstated what her salary is, but probably nothing more than enough to buy some personal luxuries for herself. In other words: hope you have a place to live, or don't mind becoming a fellow servant.

Sex: ...Ouch.  Assuming her false personality was up, she'd do her best to be an exciting partner... even if she got no pleasure from it.  If her history had been dealt with, then just like her buried emotions, she could learn to no longer take sex as something painful she has to put on an act to deal with.

Overall: Marriage with Kohaku would be a nice proposition, assuming you'd be willing to ignore her past, hidden personality, and could somehow get around the family of half-demons that would come looking for her.  If not, and you survived the repeated poisoning attempts and somehow got through to her, she might be able to lead a normal life after all... maybe."

"event","I happened across a serious doujin which focuses on Kohaku.  The point in the Tsukihime timeline after Makihisa dies and right before Shiki returns to the Tohno family.

Keep in mind, this isn't official canon, but it's well written, so I thought I'd at least type it up.

Don't read if you don't want all of Tsukihime spoiled. XD

"event","This post contains lots and lots of SPOILERS for all of Tsukihime.

<lj-cut text=""An essay on the two different sides to Kohaku."">
Kohaku, like most of the Tsukihime characters, has two different sides to her.

Kohaku's presented personality: A mixture of servantesque politeness and cheerfulness. The more young/energetic/cheerful the person talking to her is, the more she will be as well. On the other hand, politer, more serious types will be treated much more formally, but still with a little bit of carefree cheeryness.

Kohaku's true feelings: While she intellectually forms opinions and feels certain ways about people, Kohaku's actual personality is completely blank. Stemming from her abuse from her childhood (which is discussed in detail in prior posts,) Kohaku's emotions are broken. If she was to honestly answer someone who asked her: ""How are you feeling? Are you happy?"" she would answer: ""I can't answer that. I don't understand happiness or sadness. Kohaku is a mere doll, you see."" She isn't motivated by her feelings (though she has them), only by the plans she creates. She refers to these (to herself) as ""strings,"" saying: ""Kohaku is a mere doll. A doll can't move by itself. It needs strings, or a human to guide it."" (I may not be explaining the ""strings"" thing very well, but just think of it as a goal Kohaku has decided she needs to achieve, a central purpose that's outside of herself.)

The best example of this is Hisui's ""True"" Ending, from the Tsukihime video game.  In this outcome, Kohaku has succeeded in her revenge: the Tohno family is dead.  However, she gets discovered by Shiki after the fact, and confesses everything to him.  What she was doing, why she did it, how... everything.

However, one thing she adds is interesting, she didn't want to do it.  She never held any hatred toward the two Tohno siblings. (Presumably, she did for Makihisa, the father who actually raped her.) But, she literally had nothing else to do. To directly quote the game which illustrates this point rather well:

[Kohaku has just confessed to planning the murder of Tohno Akiha and Tohno Shiki, and that she was indirectly responsible for all the random murders happening in town.]

""But Shiki-san, I didn't hate Lady Akiha-sama or Shiki-sama. I didn't want to do this, that is also my true feelings.""

<i>""--------""

...What is she saying, after all she's done.</i>

""But, I didn't have anything else to do but that. I couldn't live without having an objective like that. A doll can't move on its own will. It needs strings to be able to act like a human.""

<i>""Even if that's true-----""

It can't be forgiven.</i>

""There isn't anything that I wished from my heart. But it's really strange. Everyone accepted my words as they were... They became serious, the mumbles of a 10 year old or so child. Aren't coincidences scary?""

Kohaku giggles.

<i>""-----Are you satisfied, Kohaku.""</i>

""I don't know. Because I'm a doll that doesn't understand happiness or sadness.""

<i>I look at Kohaku, expecting to hear that.

...The one here is a human who is just like a doll.

A girl whose emotion exhausted long ago, and nothing was left.

Telling herself that she's a doll that doesn't fell any pain. More than half of her really believes that, and so she really doesn't feel any pain.

That's why her wounds don't hurt.

That's why she didn't feel happy or sad when Shiki(2) or Akiha died.

A hollow human just manipulated by strings...</i>


Kohaku's buried personality: 
Although she doesn't consider this part of herself to exist anymore, occasionally things happen that get honest reactions from Kohaku that break through her facade.  If this happens, she'll probably either be going into hiding until the feelings die down and she can return to ""normal"", or confess everything she was doing and try to make amends... the latter only happens in Kohaku's ""Good"" ending in Tsukihime canon, but the former of going into hiding has happened two or three times at camp so far.

So, how does Kohaku generally react to things?

How to get on Kohaku's good side:
1. Kohaku likes people who respond to her politeness with kindness. And she always responds well to people who take the time to ask about her own condition. (""How are you doing, Kohaku?"" ""You want to know how I'm doing? I can't remember the last time someone asked me that! You're so nice."")

2. Anyone who tries, or offers to protect Kohaku in any way will make a big impression on her: it's one of her things. Actually saving her from danger is also a big plus.

3. Eat her cooking: It's delicious! (And sometimes poison.)

4. Offer to help with cooking or cleaning: she'll try to deny the help at first, but she does appreciate it.

5. Play along: Kohaku occasionally gets the urge to be silly: dress up as a magical girl, attempt to clean ALL of camp, sell random crap from her tent... etc. Playing along with her fantasy makes her think ""Ah, this person is fun!""

How to get on Kohaku's bad side:
1. Be a pervert. Kohaku hates perverts, especially ones with maid fetishes. (Chizuru's a partial exception... Kohaku's been reacting to her a bit better because Chizuru is both female, and hasn't done anything specifically targetted at Kohaku... yet. XD)

2. Be suspicious of her. Kohaku tends to panic/get anxious when she gets hints that people might be on to her... anyone who suspects her act for what it is will be regarded cautiously at best, and become a potential victim at worst. (This includes comments about her cooking or any medicines she makes.)

3. Be a demon. Kohaku's spent all her life working for (and working to destroy) a family of half-demons, so anyone who get identified as ""demon"" to her will be regarded with caution... and become a potential victim if Kohaku ever sees an opportunity.
(Note: No one's told Kohaku the KKM people aren't human. XD  She probably would adjust once she realized they don't kill humans though.)

How to truly shock Kohaku:
1. Tell her: ""It's okay. You don't have to pretend to laugh anymore."" Ie, Kohaku works on one solid principle: if she doesn't maintain secrecy over her goals and her motivations, she will die. (Not that she particularly fears death, but death would prevent her from accomplishing her revenge.)  Thus, someone, ANYONE, coming to her, and saying: ""I know about you... I know you're forcing yourself to laugh, to look cheerful... but it's all right.  I want to help you, and you don't have to do it anymore."" ...would shock her fundamentally.  This is a step to reaching Kohaku's ""Good"" ending in the Tsukihime game. (Though at first she tries to ignore it.)

2. Give her a white ribbon.
White ribbons are eternally linked with ""salvation"" in Kohaku's mind. She gave her white ribbon, one of the only possessions she owned, to the boy who lived at her house who was being sent away.  And when he returned, she made a ""bet"".  ""If that boy remembers it was me, and returns it, I'll stop all of my plans...""

Thus, receiving a white ribbon for any reason from anyone will at least shock her a little bit.  So far, Kurama, and Delirium-as-Delight have given her a white ribbon.  Kurama's was returned to Mecha-Hisui, because it was hers, but she kept Delight's and wears it with her special yukata.

3. Cause Kohaku to feel emotion.
I don't mean... by reading a really sad story to her, or something. But, if you're playing one of those types of characters with the literal ability to project or otherwise make people feel certain emotions, it'll freak Kohaku out if she gets hit by it. (For example: Delirium, as Delight, had Kohaku feel a real experience of delight.)
Why? Because in Kohaku's mind, she's a doll. Dolls don't have emotions, even if they smile or act sad.  Being made to feel something she can't deny will at least make Kohaku panic.

How to gain Kohaku's trust.
By trust, I mean get her to reveal part of her plans/real motivations and NOT either immediately kill herself or the person she's revealing it to.

1. Agree to maintain secrecy.
Fairly basic, if someone finds something of Kohaku out and announces they plan to keep pursueing the issue... Well, there's simply no helping the matter, is there? (Sorry, Izumi. XD)

2. Don't judge.
Kohaku thinks and knows what she's doing is wrong, but anyone who feels likely is clearly going to be an obstacle, even if they agree to keep it a secret.

3. Be in a position to help her.
Kohaku hasn't really thought of the proposition of anyone really HONESTLY helping her achieve her revenge, but if someone equally twisted listened to her story and offered to help in some way, she'd be overjoyed.

So far, the only people who could be said to have gained Kohaku's trust are Death and Delirium, who both embody world concepts and so fulfill 1 and 2 rather well.

One final note about Kohaku in general:
Tsukihime is a canon with a LOT of strong/immortal/god-moder characters in it.  Shiki can kill ANYTHING, animate or inanimate.  Arcueid is normally ultra powerful, and even in the weakened state she's in after Shiki ""kills"" her is able to hold her own against equally powerful vampires.  Akiha similarly has the power to imprisonand kill things with her half-demonic powers...

Thus, Kohaku (and Hisui)... are kinda weird, the only humans with powers that don't even let them participate in direct combat.

That said, Kohaku comes off as once of the strongest characters in the series. XD  To paraphrase: ""The stronger a person, the more simple their thinking."" Kohaku is not strong.  She's barely 5' 1"", has no extra-human powers, and bleeds easily. But it's because of that she honed her deception skills to their max.  Even if there were things she couldn't hide, she basically gets away with everything, regardless of what ending in Tsukihime you reach.

There's an unofficial side story that illustrates this point pretty well that I'll post a little later.

1. Basic Stats:

Kohaku
Age: 18
Birthdate: March 12th
Race: Human
Gender: Female
Height: A little under 5'1""  (156 cm)
Weight: 95 lbs.  (43 kg)
Blood type: B
Occupation: Oriental-style maid for the rich Tohno Family.

2. Canon Information:

<b>Tsukihime</b>

From App: Kohaku is the older half of twin sisters who act as maids for the rich Tohno family. At first glance, Kohaku is cheerful, and very upbeat. Always speaking cutely, and happily attending to her work with a smile. ...But the truth is, this is all a facade. Her smiles and good cheer are completely false emotions, hiding a deep obsession with revenge against the family she serves. The reasons being that she was abused by them when she was a child living there. Kohaku has no qualms with using any means to achieve her goals, including poisoning, controlling others through the use of hallucinogens (which she knows how to create because of her training as a doctor), intentionally deceiving those who would be kind to her, giving people the means to kill others, provoking others into killing, etc. (The one exception is using her sister, Hisui, who she wants to keep apart from all of her madness.) Deep down though, she's not a truly evil person. But she's been deceiving herself and others for such a long time, she knows no other way to live.

She wears an oriental style kimono, and is rarely seen without her traditional Japanese broom in her hand (partially because she hides a sword in it).

Miscellaneous Factoids:
-When it comes to her skill at actual housework, she's good at cooking, but bad at cleaning. (She's only allowed to clean the outside of the house, because if she cleaned the inside, she'd just make a mess.)
-Scored second in the most recent popularity contest for her canon! (Considering she's actually a minor character, this is unexpected!)
-Her secret hobby is playing video games.
-Her formal duties as a maid at the house she works are to take care of the cooking and attend to Tohno Akiha.
-Kohaku and her sister aren't even allowed to leave the house of their own free will. (They do receive a salary, free room and board, and some time to themselves at the house, though.)

Real, Actual Backstory: I think I covered most of it in Kohaku's timeline and other writeups, but...

Kohaku (and her sister Hisui) were both orphans taken in by the Tohno Family.  This was not out of the kindness on behalf of the Tohno Family, but the fact that they both had special abilities they were born with that the Tohno Family needed. To back up for a second, the Tohno Family is a family of demon hybrids.  However, demon blood doesn't mix very well with human blood, and if the half of them that's demon overpowers the half of human, they lose their human consciousness and start killing everything in sight.  This was beginning to happen to the master of the Tohno Family, but he could slow the process with the help of Kohaku (or Hisui). Their power involved the ability to give another person ""energy"", make them more powerful, healthier, better able, etc.  However, in order to use this power, Kohaku (or Hisui) would have to share body fluids with the person they wanted to give energy to.  (Sharing blood is a possibility, but the link becomes strongest through sexual intercourse.)  When they were young, Kohaku was shy, while Hisui was energetic, so Kohaku was chosen to have it happen to her because it seemed less likely she'd resist.  Of course, being raped would devastate anyone emotionally, and Kohaku was no exception.  In order to deal with the pain, she started telling herself: ""This isn't happening to me... I'm just a doll.  A doll doesn't have any feelings... it just accepts what happens to it.  So, no matter what happens, it won't hurt...""

Since Kohaku accepted it and was able to ""adapt"", Hisui was never harmed.  However, Kohaku was getting more and more wrapped in her delusion as the years went by.  At first she thought she and Hisui would be able to find some way to escape, but when it was clear that was impossible, her biggest hope became: ""The master of the Tohno Family is old... he'll have to die eventually.""

While that was true, eventually Kohaku became to be used the same way by the son, and she realized her abuse would never end.  What could she do to escape her situation?  The answer came to her: ""The entire Tohno Family simply has to go away...""  

Of course, she could never hope to accomplish such a thing if anyone found out she was doing it.  (Normal humans could never hope to kill a demon-hybrid, to put it mildly.)  So, she worked quietly.  Kohaku and her sister were trained to be maids for the family, and Kohaku had full control of the meals.  It was easy to slip some poison into the family's food, and their conditions worsened.  There's three outcomes that can occur in the game: (highlight to see)

<font color=""white"">1. Kohaku achieves her revenge: everyone in the Tohno Family dies except for her and her sister. (And the main character you play as, Tohno Shiki.)  However, having completed her revenge, she couldn't find anything else to live for, and so killed herself.  (""I'm just a doll... a doll needs strings or a person to guide it in order to move... now that my revenge is done, I looked for new strings, but I just couldn't find any..."")

2. Tohno Shiki confesses his love for her and gives Kohaku new hope for living: she gives up her goal of revenge.  Of course, she nearly gets killed by the surviving Tohno Akiha, who realized what she was doing. But in the end, everyone's still alive, and Kohaku has gone to work for another family (where she's occasionally visited by Shiki). 

3. Kohaku's actions take a back seat to the other happenings going on, and the game ends without her story being resolved.</font>

3. Skills and Powers:

Kohaku is a Synchronizer, meaning she has the ability to give another person ""energy"" (make them stronger, healthier, etc.) if she shares body fluids with them.  After the exchange, she has to maintain relatively close proximity with the person to maintain the connection, but otherwise there's no limit to this ability.

Besides this, Kohaku is a competent maid, doctor, and mechanic (enough to build her own robot at any rate).  She can (and does) also make a variety of poisons and medicines from seemingly common ingredients.

...she does also have a sword hidden in her broom, which she knows how to use.

4. Quick List of Friends and Foes:
(Strictly canon right now. Spoilers/detailed info whited out.)

Friends: 
Tohno Shiki: The main character of the game. (Whose decisions are controlled by you.)  Kohaku treats him in a friendly manner, agreeing to call him ""Shiki-san"" instead of ""Shiki-sama,"" and accepting his help with the cooking when he offers.  Shiki thinks of her as a cheerful (if a little nosy) maid, and a good friend.  <font color=""white"">Shiki has no idea what her past has been like, and he at first thinks she was the energetic girl who invited him to play in the backyward when they were young (as opposed to the shy girl, watching at the window).  Kohaku does know Shiki's backstory though, and that he's not really related to the Tohno's, but was from a family of demon hunters that were wiped out by the Tohno family when he was young, and after, they brought him to the house, sans memories.</font>

Hisui: Kohaku's dear sister! They're very close, but Kohaku is definitely the more outgoing of the two.  Hisui seems almost emotionless in comparison, only doing what's asked of her. They get along very well, of course. In contrast to Kohaku, Hisui' official duties include taking care of the cleaning, and attending to Tohno Shiki. <font color=""white"">Hisui is actually the one of the two who has emotions, but she keeps them all inside. Hisui used to be cheerful, but when she found out her sister had been raped, she became silent and withdrawn.  At the same time, Kohaku became more cheerful.  Hisui suspected Kohaku was just acting, but didn't want to risk upsetting her.  The end result: Hisui and Kohaku switched places from how their personalities were when they were young. Hisui never knew Kohaku had been planning all of the bad occurrances that had been happening around the house.</font>

Foes:
Tohno SHIKI (Different kanji used for his name from the previous Tohno Shiki, a different chracter): Kohaku's ward who she's responsible for.  <font color=""white"">Throughout the game, SHIKI is the one responsible for killing random people in town.  But he only does this because Kohaku poisons him to make him go crazy.  He never even realizes it... it's a little sad.</font>

Tohno Akiha: Somewhere between friend and foe for Kohaku. Despite being nearly the same age as Kohaku, she's the 'master' of the Tohno Family, and can be very strict with her dealings with the maids.  Kohaku regards her with healthy caution as she does her daily tasks. <font color=""white"">When Akiha realized Kohaku was being raped by her father for her power, she talked him into stopping, freeing her from his abuse.  This move shocked Kohaku, but didn't alter her plans for revenge.  In truth, Akiha did feel sorry for Kohaku, but she also knows Kohaku is planning something, so they have a very strange relationship.</font>

Acquaintances:
Ciel: A girl from Shiki's school who is quite strict, but has a weakness for curry. (It's her favorite food, and she's easily bribed with it.) <font color=""white"">Kohaku would have no idea as to Ciel's real nature.</font>

Arcueid Brunestud: A vampire princess Shiki somehow managed to make the acquaintance of Shiki.  Cute, and nice enough.  <font color=""white"">Kohaku would know Shiki killed Arcueid, as Kohaku was the one who cleaned the blood off his clothes after it happened and carried him back to the house.</font>

CAMP RELATIONSHIP LIST COMING SOON! (maybe)"

"event","As a ""choose your own adventure""-ish game character, Kohaku has a lot of potentiality when it comes to what to draw from.  There're three main sources:

1. Tsukihime - the main game, and its many story branches.  There're five different ""routes"" you can take in the game, representing the five different girls.  And they all have two endings each. (Except for Kohaku, who has one, and Akiha, who has three.) There's also the anime and manga for Tsukihime, but the anime/manga is just like the game, only it only follows one path, with a few changes to make the story progress a little smoother. Thus, for consideration of the serious ""main canon,"" it's okay to just pay attention to the main game and not so much to the anime or manga, because the game has the story shown in the manga and also four other ones. 

The main game also includes Kagetsu Touya, a 'sequel' which doesn't really have too much of a main plot, but reveals a lot of side stories about the various characters. (Though these aren't all serious, so they have to be taken with a bit of salt.)

(I should also point out that unlike most japanese ""dating games"" where the story usually only follows the girl you're focusing on, different stories can reveal different things about any of the girls. Thus, I couldn't simply say this Kohaku is from the branch where you get her ending.)

2. Melty Blood - the fighting game ""sequel"" which is a continuation one year after the main story.  It's unlike Kagetsu Touya in that it actually is a serious story with a plot.  Not only does it introduce new characters, it also gives a lot of fighting skills to all the characters, even those who didn't have any before. XD

3. Doujin - Tsukihime has a LOT of (non-h) fan doujin for it.  It numbers in the fifties or so in terms of just sheer volumes, considering all the publishers who make them.  They're gag doujin for the most part, but they occasionally have a cute idea or something interesting, and they're sold in real stores, so I decided to use them too. XD
<lj-cut>
<b>Kohaku</b>
(Stealing Excel's bicanon subcategories to start...)

<b>Intelligence:</b>
1. Kohaku has a lot of biological, medicine book learning because she was trained to be a doctor.  She creates various medicines, poisons, and other substances with unique effects. (Such as her poison that gives a person suggestive dreams and lets her whisper what she wants them to feel while they sleep.)  However, Kohaku does have sorta ditzy, clueless moments as well. (When Shiki complains about hearing dogs last night, Kohaku asks him if he had a ""Wan Wan Panic."" (Bow Wow Panic, a name of an old japanese video game. XD) She's also trained to represent ""eastern"" culture in her home, and is a very good chef.  Of course, where she really shines is in her ability to plan and con and keep it a secret from everyone, even the people she lives day to day with and her own sister.  (Akiha's probably the only one who ever gets the idea that Kohaku's primary motivation is revenge, but either she doesn't understand the scope of it (and thus ignores it), or she thinks she'll be able to dispose of Kohaku once she no longer needs her.

2. Hisui and Kohaku have the option of fighting as a team, and if you watch their interactions, it's clear Kohaku is the ""brains"" of the group, as she leads them around, decides what to do next, etc.

3. Kohaku doesn't only know a lot about biology, but robotics as well.  As evidenced by her creation of Mecha Hisui, her robot version of her sister.

Overall: I have my suspicions the ditzy moments are more subterfuge than honest ""Oh! Time to do something retarded"" moments. But besides that, Kohaku has all of her biological, robotic, and culinary knowledge.

<b>Fun/Hobbies:</b>
1. The maid sisters (Kohaku and Hisui) never even leave the house by their own free will. Never the less, Kohaku has a few hobbies.  One of them is video games.  She hides a playstation2 in her room from Akiha (the girl who's master of the house).  Her favorite games are Bloody Roar, Grand Theft Auto, and Paperboy. She's quite skilled, enough to beat most opponents without taking a hit.
Kohaku ALSO has an almost scary hobby of cosplaying.  Her main costume is:
Broom Girl Magical Amber - her witch's uniform cosplay.  She actually refers to herself by this name and even acts a little like a magical girl. ""Broom Girl Magical Amber is here to protect the house from perverts like you!""
And her more special costume:
Mister Chin: Blue china dress cosplay. Why 'Mister'?  It is a mystery.

2. Her cosplay costumes are actual special moves in the game. XD

3. Her Mister Chin cosplay is that of a spy/villain from Kung Fu movies.  While wearing the costume, she practices some kung fu, and then whips out a cell phone, saying: ""Yes, boss.  Leave the police who'll be following us to me.  The Hong Kong mafia will tie up the entire interpol syndicate with our hold on the narcotics black market."" (Of course, it's all fantasy, but considering Kohaku does poison people in the main game, it's sorta scary. XD)

Overall: Nothing to be harmed by including all of it, I think.

<b>Fighting Ability:</b>
1. Kohaku has basically no fighting ability. She relies on manipulation and subterfuge and is able to fool people who're much stronger than her.  The closest we get to seeing her wield a weapon is one ending where she stabs herself to commit suicide.  Although, there IS an ending where Kohaku goes off to fight Akiha.  Akiha has her demon powers fully activated, and is fully pissed at Kohaku by this time.  Kohaku had to have *some* sort of fight plan there, but not sure what it could be. (Didn't have to be a good one, as Akiha does string her up in that ending.)

2. Kohaku fights with this broom she carries around.  Her broom hides a SWORD in it, which she uses battou-jutsu style. (For those who haven't seen Rurouni Kenshin: 'battou-jutsu' is holding a sword in its sheath, and drawing it out and attacking in one instant, and then sheathing it again when done.  Kohaku uses this, as there's no point when you play her that she just holds the sword out and attacks with it.  It's an assassin's attack, and I think really says something about her character.)  Besides this, she can also straight out inject people with 'medicines' she's made, and has some knowledge of Kung Fu.

3. The fights Kohaku gets into last about five seconds.  Ie, they're all her stabbing people in the back when they aren't expecting it.

Overall: I think the game has enough leeway to allow Melty Blood capable Kohaku, so I'm going with that. (She has her broom-sword, at least.)  But that Kohaku has fighting ability will be a closely kept secret.

<b>Supernatural Ability:</b>
1. Kohaku is a completely normal human except for her Synchronization ability, where she can give another person energy through transfer of bodily fluids.  This power is what caused her to be raped for her ability and made her what she is today. Other than that, unless she has some other latent demon-hunting power that's yet to show itself, nothing else about Kohaku (or Hisui) is supernatural.

2. Kohaku gets the ability to fly through the air for a few seconds with her broom while in her Magical Amber cosplay.  (And the ability to change her clothes in one motion, and to pull out needles and the 16 ton weights out of nowhere.)  She also has ""magical gardening"" as a weapon, where she tosses out a plotted plant which attacks for her.

3. Nothing too different from 1 and 2, except the effects of Kohaku's drugs get a little more implausible. (Kohaku making a drug to make people two stories tall, for example.)

Overall: I thought including the ""gardening"" and flying powers she has in the Melty Blood game would be pushing it, so I'm keeping it at the level of the original Tsukihime: Kohaku has her synchronization ability, but that's it. (Although I reserve the right to do crazy things with Kohaku's medicine eventually. XD)

<b>Sexuality:</b>
1. Sex is something Kohaku has to do when people want her power. Ie, she has big issues. (she doesn't particularly act repressed in normal situations though.)
Besides the main sex scenes when the main character chooses Kohaku in the game, there's also a side story where Hisui and Kohaku have sex.  But I have no idea what the details are or if it even tries to be partially serious. <b>UPDATE: The sidestory is not serious at all, and is basically just a reason to include more h-images.</b>

2. N/a. Fighting game, afterall.

3. Kohaku has an obsession with Hisui that ranges from cute sisterly devotion to... just unhealthy. XD (Incestuous tones in a hentai game? GASP AND SHOCK!)  Kohaku is also a bit of a perv, she has porn/hentai magazines that range from lolicon to huge breast fetishes.

Overall: Regarding Hisui: keeping it in the spectrum of ""borderline strange sisterly devotion.""

<b>Mecha Hisui:</b>
Her own section!
1. She doesn't exist. :( I don't even think there's a side story about her.

2. She's her own character, but she's not in the main storyline.  One of the stages is called ""Kohaku's Laboratory,"" a big manufacturing facility with a big banner that reads ""KOHAKU"" and lines and rows of Mecha Hisuis.  Mecha Hisui only listens to Kohaku, but does recognize the actual Hisui when she sees her too. She's also damn powerful, she has more weapons than I can count, at least. (Including: jet packs, rockets, a laser crossbow, a flame crossbow, lasers from her eyes, bombs, the ability to stretch her arms ""inspector gadget"" style, a huge CHAINSAW, a hyper powered rocket pack, etc etc!  She might as well be Inspector Gadget for all the stuff she has.)

3. Quite a few stories about Mecha Hisui being part of the normal family life are there.  There's one story where the real Hisui accidentally breaks Mecha Hisui, then wears a mask and masquerades as her for a while.  Besides this, Mecha Hisui just generally speaks in monotones and responds to commands, occasionally misinterpreting them or just making dumb mistakes for comedy relief.  There's at least one story that has Mecha Hisui as not having any will of her own, just being something Kohaku controls with a remote.

Overall: Mecha Hisui is at camp, but Kohaku had to build her.  No more will run around unless Kohaku gets more materials to work with. XD Mecha Hisui has no real personality beyond ""talk like a computer"", so I went with it.

<b>Kohaku's Con Game:</b>
1. This is the one thing Kohaku excels at more than any other character in the series, the ability to fool the people around her and hide her desire for revenge under her facade of happiness, even from her own twin sister and those she lives with day to day. (Akiha's probably the only one who ever gets the idea that Kohaku's primary motivation is revenge, but either she doesn't understand the scope of it [and thus ignores it], or she thinks she'll be able to dispose of Kohaku once she no longer needs her.)  The only time Shiki catches on is after it happens, when Kohaku confesses the entire thing blind to him.

2. Kohaku is defined as a ""trick"" character and she does have lots of tricky moves. XD

3. In most doujin, apparently the fact Kohaku does her best to poison people is common knowledge. :O  And yet, life just goes on, no confrontation about it... it's kinda weird. XD

Overall: If the truth about Kohaku ever did come out, I'd HOPE it wouldn't just be used for comedy relief. XD;  Still brainstorming for what maybe to do when it happens. (If it ever does.)
</lj-cut>

...And more as I think of them. I'll add updates sooner or later!

"event","Here's a short timeline of Kohaku's life.  Up to the point she gets pulled from the Tsukihime timeline and taken to campfuckudie.  Reveals a bit about Tsukihime as well as what ""point"" Kohaku is from.

Contains LOTS of spoilers.

<lj-cut>
Lexicon:

Synchronization: Kohaku and Hisui's bloodline power that they were born with.  The power to give others 'energy' to make them perform better and feel better despite ailments. In order to establish the connection with someone, Kohaku or Hisui need to share body fluids with that person.  Sucking blood is a possibility, but sexual intercourse establishes the strongest connection.

Reversing: The process where a demon-human hybrid's blood becomes more demon than human, resulting in them losing human consciousness and attacking everything in sight.  It's possible to recover from this after it happens... at least for a little while.

SHIKI vs. Shiki: In Japanese, these names are written with different kanji, so no one is confused even though they're pronounced the same way.  But to clarify as I wrote here, Shiki is the main hero, while SHIKI is the other SHIKI with the same name who appears as a plot twist later. Hopefully it's not too confusing.

1. March 12th: Kohaku and Hisui are born.  Kohaku is born first, earning her the right to be called ""neesan"" by Hisui forever.  There is no information about their birth family, except that it was related to a family of demon hunters called the Fujyou.  Kohaku and Hisui were both a rare case where they received the power of ""synchronization"" from that family through their bloodline, though their parents were only marginally related.

2. After #1, unknown: Kohaku and Hisui's parents die somehow, and Kohaku and Hisui are both orphans. Kohaku states in the game later than they never even knew what their parents looked like.

3. After #1: Kohaku and Hisui are taken to live with the Tohno family, which consists of Tohno Makihisa, the father and head of the family, Tohno Akiha, who is about the same age as Kohaku and Hisui, and the real Tohno SHIKI.  They are probably about six or seven years old at this point.

4. After #3, March 12th, Kohaku and Hisui's eighth birthday: Makihisa starts to use Kohaku to stave off his reversing. That is, he begins raping her for her power.  He chooses her because she is shy while Hisui is energetic, and thus she's less likely to resist.  No one but Kohaku and him know about it. Kohaku becomes more distant, and eventually learns to cope with the pain by telling herself: ""This isn't me.  I'm a mere doll... a doll can't feel any pain.""  To bring in a quote directly from the game, which Kohaku writes in her diary:

<i>""...That's why I should just turn into a doll.
My body will slowly stop making pulses.
Blood vessels will become a single tube.
Blood disappearing, like vapor.
My heart and everything becoming sculptures that only have a shape.
See, that's why it will no longer
hurt...""</i>

Makihisa also considers doing the same to Hisui because as a child, Kohaku is insufficient by herself.  But Kohaku wants to protect Hisui and tells him: ""Please, you can use me freely... so please, don't hurt Hisui.""  He agrees, partly from shame and partly from desire to keep as few people as possible knowing.

4. After #2: the Tohno family raids and kills the Nanaya clan of demon hunters.  The only survivor is a boy about seven years old, who Makihisa decides to spare because his name is also ""Shiki"" like his own son's.

5. After #4, Unknown: Nanaya Shiki comes to live with the Tohno family (he may or may not have had his memories of his previous family erased, not sure).  He's considered a brother by Akiha, and probably by SHIKI too. Hisui often comes to his room, begging him to come play, and they escape outside for a while.  During these times, Kohaku is always silently watching from the window.  But she never joins them.  She later remarked it seemed that Shiki and Hisui were in a completely different world, and that she could never be a part of it.

6. After #5: SHIKI reverses, and attempts to kill Akiha, but Shiki steps in and saves her, and he's killed instead.  Akiha saves Shiki's life after he dies without realizing it by taking his life into her own.  Shiki is sent to the hospital, but only after he has his memory erased of both the incident and SHIKI, so he's told he was involved in a car accident.  Regardless of whatever tampering with his memory might've been done before, Shiki has no memory of SHIKI and has no doubt that he's really Tohno Shiki, Akiha's true brother, by now. Shiki is about eight years old.

7. After #6: Shiki discovers his eyes of mystic death perception, meets his sensei, etc. etc.

8. After #7, some time in spring: Shiki returns to the Tohno family, but this is only temporary as Makihisa chooses to send him to a relative family.  Neither Akiha nor Hisui knows about this, but Kohaku overhears Makihisa talking about it. She barely knows what to do, but she goes to see him.  They meet under a tree in the front yard, and Kohaku gives Shiki a white ribbon she had, one of her, if not her only possessions.  She's asks him to please return it to her one day.  She later says: ""The one thing I wondered, was why... why was I stuck being surrounded by evil people?  Why couldn't they have been nice, like that boy?""

9. After #8: Tohno Shiki leaves to live with the Arima family.  He'll live there for eight years in a quiet existence before Makihisa dies and he comes back to the Tohno manor.

10. After #6: Makihisa cannot bring himself to kill his own son, Tohno SHIKI, and has him chained in a guest house away from the normal house, and Kohaku is assigned to take care of him. The result is SHIKI begins using Kohaku similar to how Makihisa did.

11. After #6: Hisui and Kohaku are trained to be maids for the family.  Kohaku is also given training to be a doctor by Jinan Sougen, the Tohno family doctor, personal doctor to Tohno Shiki. Kohaku becomes Makihisa's personal doctor.

12. After #10: Kohaku, her last emotion torn out by SHIKI, begins to think: ""How can I escape this situation?""  She comes up with an answer: ""The entire Tohno family just has to go away..."" After realizing this, she laughs, for the first time in ages.

13. After #12: Kohaku let's SHIKI drink her blood whenever he wants, and just accepts him, telling him he's fine the way he is.  She also starts feeding him hallucinogens that put him into a suggestive state.

14. After #13: Kohaku tells Akiha to look into Makihisa's room at night. She discovers Makihisa is raping Kohaku, and forces him to stop. (Not by force, she just pursues the issue until he agrees.) Kohaku is a bit surprised that Akiha frees her from him, but continues her plans for revenge. (Kohaku is about 13 at this point, so it's about five years after Shiki has gone to the Arima family.)

15. After #13: Hisui has become silent, partially because of depression of the events that led to Shiki being sent away, and also because she too finds out what was happening to Kohaku. (Exactly how isn't said, I don't think.)  Kohaku decides to switch places with her, and puts on a cheery disposition. (""When this doll is smiling, people treat it a little bit more tenderly.  So I'll always be smiling."")  Hisui is so grateful to see Kohaku acting happy that she never attempts to go back to acting how she previously did, for fear that it would make Kohaku change back too. (In other words, even if Kohaku might've been acting, Hisui was grateful her sister at least appeared happy and didn't want to chance jeopardising it in any way.)  If Akiha notices this change, she either doesn't care, or doesn't have the time to care enough to do anything about it.

16. After #15: Kohaku whispers ""kill Makihisa"" to SHIKI when he's in his drugged state, and so he does. Makihisa doesn't survive because he's weakened from his deteriorating condition, and the fact Kohaku was also poisoning his food. Shiki is about 16 at this point, and Kohaku 17 so it's only a little bit before the game timeline begins.

17. After #16: Akiha takes over the Tohno family.  SHIKI is still confined to being caged in an unused guest house. Akiha fires all the maids in the house except for Hisui and Kohaku.

18. After #17: Akiha begins using Kohaku for her ability.  They don't have sex, but Akiha drinks Kohaku's blood and receives the power that way. This continues up to and throughout the game.  Besides making Akiha stronger, it's also making her demon blood stronger, thus increasing the likeliness she'll reverse as well. This is Kohaku's plan.

19. After #17: Akiha orders Shiki back to the mansion to live with them.  Shiki leaves the Arima family and returns to the Tohno family.

20. After #19: Upon hearing Shiki is coming back to the mansion, Kohaku makes a bet with herself.  If Shiki remembers it was Kohaku who gave him the ribbon and returns it to her, despite that Hisui and her switched personalities, she'll stop all of her plans for revenge.  She remarks later in the game: ""You were the only one that really scared me, Shiki-san.  Watching you from that window, I felt something.  I knew that feeling might turn me back into a human, and I was scared."" 

21. After #19: Shiki returns to the Tohno family and is reacquainted with his sister, and Hisui and Kohaku, who he remembers as ""one of them was energetic and we played a lot, the other was shy and watched from the window...""

THE TSUKIHIME GAME BEGINS

22. After #21: Kohaku gives Shiki a knife with the emblem ""Nanaya.""  She tells him it's a gift sent from the Arima family, but she actually found it among Makihisa's private things. (This happens regardless of what path you take in the game.)

23. After #21: Kohaku begins poisoning Shiki with the same hallucinogens she's feeding SHIKI, making him see dreams of him murdering people and thinking he likes to kill. (This also happens regardless of what path you take in the game, but in some paths it's more emphasized than others.)

24. After #21: Shiki talks to Hisui about returning the white ribbon to her, since she's the shy one.  She doesn't know what he's talking about. (Appears in quite a few plotlines, unless Shiki just completely ignores the maids.)

25. After #24: Kohaku briefs Hisui about the ribbon, including what color it was and the promise to return it, so that she's able to play along and doesn't make it obvious to Shiki that they ""switched places.""  Hisui agrees to act.  (Note: This isn't actually shown in the game, but given the only possible way Shiki finds out that the ribbon was Kohaku's is when he catches Hisui in a lie about it, it *had* to happen.  Nothing else makes sense.  And Hisui had to on some level agree to play along with the subterfuge too.)

KOHAKU COMES TO CAMPFUCKUDIE!

...And that's where I consider Kohaku is from, timeline wise.

If anyone has any questions or wants anything clarified, feel free to comment.  It's easy to lose track of Tsukihime sometimes because there're so many possible outcomes."

"event","RE: Kohaku-rper's Tsukihime canon character app wishlist!

That is, this is a listing of the Tsukihime characters I'd really like to see at camp, and the various reasons why. :D
<lj-cut>
In no particular order:

<b>Tohno Shiki:</b> Does this need explaining?  He's the protagonist of the story, and he actually has an pretty interesting personality enough to make him interesting at camp on his own, I think.  It might be a hard app, though, unless you had an idea on how to make his 'eyes of death' ability funny.

If a Shiki ever showed up at camp, Kohaku would at least try to tend to his every need. (She may or may not begin poisoning him again. Though probably would. XD) Shiki would be the one and only character who could make Kohaku drop her facade as well, so him just being there would help open up parts of her personality.

<b>Hisui:</b> Kohaku's beloved sister Hisui. Hisui is shy, polite, devoted, and easily the most 'normal' of all the Tsukihime main characters.  She might not be fun at camp on her own, I admit, because although she has emotions, she almost always keeps them in reserve and never really lets them be known. (And I don't think she has the personality to start working like a maid for other people like Kohaku has been doing since she got to camp.)  However, with Kohaku here as well, it'd be much more interesting. XD

Truth be told, I was thinking of apping her myself, but I decided against it as the sheer playercest would kill me ded.  But, Hisui being at camp would enable Kohaku in a lot of ways.  Hisui's personality is the sheer opposite of Kohaku's, so it'd help make her brightness even more apparent by comparison.  Kohaku would also be able to force Hisui into helping her poison/get revenge on people from time to time I think.

<b>Tohno Akiha:</b> Shiki's sister, and one of the three main heroines.  Another character who'd probably be hard to have at camp on her own, because her personality is also very reserved and detached from people she doesn't know.  But her powers would open a number of possibilities for interaction, I think.

And regarding how she would be with Kohaku also here, this would be interesting!  Rather than enabling Kohaku (like Hisui) or showing more sides of Kohaku (like Shiki), Akiha being at camp would actually make Kohaku a little more on guard (she's the only one besides Hisui who knows somethings wrong with Kohaku).  She'd of course quit her freelance maid work and go back to working for her, so she'd also have something to do.  She'd have to work hard to keep a balance between her plans for revenge and keeping Akiha's suspicions of her down.

<b>Arcueid Brunestud:</b> It might be difficult to have Arcuied at camp without a Shiki.  Or without a Roa to fight.  She'd need something to fixate on, quick, or she might just get bored. ""Zombies? Yeah, downed a hundred of them by breathing. *Ho hum*""

Arcueid would be one of the few people Kohaku wouldn't know how to regard, really.  She knows she's powerful, and thus couldn't be manipulated by normal means, but she's also rather naive at the same time.  An interesting thing to be around, at any rate.

<b>Ciel:</b> Ciel's personality is difficult.  She'd be torn between wanting to kill all of the demons and giving people advice, I think. XD;  It'd be interesting to have her here though, for sheer ""warrior nun"" value.

I don't think Kohaku knows Ciel's identity, so she'd probably regard her as Shiki's selfish older classmate (who wants to keep him at the tea ceremony club all day and night).

<b>Aozaki Aoko:</b> I still think she'd make an awesome counselor, but it'd be really hard to app her.  She's one of those characters who is like ""I'm completely normal with a completely normal personality! ...and I happen to be one of the five surviving magicians left in the world.  Ha."" Tsukihime has a lot of those. XD

Kohaku wouldn't even know her, they might not even realize they're from the same universe unless Shiki got mentioned.

-The end (for now)"

"event","In an attempt to get more people <s>hooked</s> familiar with the canon Kohaku's from, here's a spoiler-free overview of the first game.  Nothing will be spoiled here that isn't spoiled in like, the first volume of the manga. XD;

All of this is a general addition/rewrite to my first canon writeup, found <a href=http://community.livejournal.com/campersfuckoff/431196.html>here</a>.

<lj-cut text=""The prologue and general set up."">
Tsukihime begins with Tohno Shiki, the son in the rich Tohno family, waking up in a hospital when he's about 7 or 8 or so. He's told he was in a car accident and almost died, it's a miracle he's still alive. Shiki can barely listen, whatever he looks at has these deep, dark scratches in it, like scribbling on a paper. The doctor's face has it, the bed has it, the table has it... everything. 

Curious, he eventually tries cutting along the lines. It didn't matter if he used a knife or a piece of paper, if it was able to fit in those lines, he could completely destroy anything by cutting them.  A table falls apart.  Then a bed.  Shiki is asked how on Earth he did such a thing, but all he can explain is it was because of those dark lines.

He's kept at the hospital, but eventually he gets fed up and runs away to a nearby field, where he just sits and rests in the sun. He meets a woman, named Aozaki Aoko. They talk, and he eventually explains his power to her, and that he gets sick even looking at anything now. She says she can do something about that, and gives him a pair of glasses. He tries them on, and the lines disappear. The glasses block out the lines while he's wearing them. Shiki is grateful, but doesn't understand how she could have something such as that. She reveals she's obviously not just some normal woman, she's a sorceress. (One of five people in the world who can use 'true' magic.) And then, she leaves Shiki, with the advice that he should become a fine man, because his ability can be used for good or evil.

After this, Shiki is sent, by his father's decision, to live with the Arima family, who're loosely related to their own. After about eight years, his father dies, and he returns home. To the big Tohno mansion, to live with his sister (a girl almost his age named Akiha), and the twin Tohno maids that're also almost the same age: Hisui and Kohaku.
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""The Important Characters""><b>The Important Characters:</b>

<b>Tohno Shiki</b>: Having gained a startling ability to see 'lines' which cause the death of whatever he cuts, Shiki tries his best to lead an ordinary life.  Despite his power, he rarely if ever uses it, and has a strong sense of right and wrong. He's said to be partially suffering from anemia, probably also gained from the time he almost died in a car crash. (It's jokingly said that Shiki is a lot like Keitaro from Love Hina, if only he went crazy and started knifing people. XD) He has a serious personality, but there's a part to him that's very upbeat and optimistic about the world as well.  He figures it's hard to hate life when you've come so close to death before.

<b>Arcueid Brunestone</b>: A girl Shiki passes by on his way home from school one day.  Strangely, he's drawn, as if commanded, into following her.  He trails her back to her apartment building, waits until they're out of sight, and then kills her.  She's throughly cut into seventeen separate pieces by the time he's finished. Strangely, this does not affect her too badly, as she meets Tohno Shiki the next day, asking him why he felt the need to kill her.
...Turns out, Arcueid is a Vampire Princess, and she can't die (at least not that easily). She has a very playful personality, and forces Shiki into helping her fight other crazy-vampires in exchange for weakening her.  Her quote: ""I'll make you take responsibility for killing me!""

<b>Ciel</b>: Ciel is Shiki's sempai at school.  She sits and eats lunch with him and his friends everyday.  She has a number of odd hobbies: she's the president (and only member!) of the school Tea Ceremony Club, she has a fondness for cosplay, and she *loves* anything having to do with curry.  She eats curry rice every meal.  There does seem to be some mystery about her... when Shiki meets her one day, he finds it difficult to remember who she is. At least, until she gives him a strong stare in the eyes.

<b>Tohno Akiha</b>: Shiki's sister.  A girl raised very strictly to become prim and proper.  She regards Shiki sweetly (if a bit jealously), but she can be quite stern when dealing with outsiders or her two maids.  She goes to a private girl's school, and is technically the Master of the family since their father died.  She tries not to let on, but she's very concerned over her flat chest...

<b>Hisui</b>: One of the two maids at the Tohno house.  Hisui is polite, shy, and good at cleaning, but bad at cooking. She remembers Shiki from when they were children, though is slow to talk to him, keeping distance between them.  Despite this, she is quite devoted: she personally waits from the time Shiki leaves for school until the time he comes home, just to welcome him back.  She does the same when Shiki wakes up in the morning... is it devotion or obsession?

<b>Kohaku</b>: The other maid at the Tohno house.  There were more servants until recently, but after Shiki and Akiha's father died, Akiha made the decision to fire all of the staff except for Hisui and Kohaku.  In contrast to Hisui, Kohaku is good at cooking, but bad at cleaning.  She's also much more cheerful and open than her sister. Always having a smile on her face, and happily calls Shiki ""Shiki-san"" instead of ""Shiki-sama"" when he asks (unlike Hisui).  She has a special garden where she grows her own personal ingredients for the evening menu, but she won't let anyone see it...

<b>Yumiduka Satsuki</b>: Almost a minor character, Satsuki is a classmate of Shiki's he's known since middle school. She was trapped in a locked shed with some friends, until Shiki cut the lock (with his ability) and freed them.  From that time, they've been friends.  She secretly has a crush on Shiki, but is happy to just walk home with him occasionally...

<b>Aozaki Aoko</b>: The older woman Shiki meets when he's young.  She seems friendly at first, but she actually has a rather rough personality.  She hates her name, because it sounds like ""Blue Blue"" (in Japanese, ""ao"" means ""blue"").  When she tells this to Shiki, he decides to call her ""sensei.""  After they part, he never refers to anyone else as ""sensei"" besides her, a sign of how much he respects her.  She seemingly always has a suitcase with her, and is always traveling somewhere...  Shiki hopes they'll meet again, but he hasn't seen her since he was eight.
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""A note about Tsukihime""><b>A note about Tsukihime:</b>
Tsukihime was originally a Doujin game.

What's a doujin game? It's (usually) a hentai game, released by fans, for other fans to buy. They don't tend to be very popular, but Tsukihime was an overwhelming exception. The depth of the story and the characters was easily as good as something a professional company could make, and Tsukihime quickly became the most popular doujin game of all time. From the original game, Tsukihime has since gotten a lot of side stories and continuations written for it, numerous fan doujin, and the group of people that originally made it have since become their own professional company. Tsukihime also has its own fighting game (called: Melty Blood), and the story was adapted to an anime (though fans tend to agree the anime really wasn't very good). It also currently has a manga series still progressing as well (which fans are agreeing is much better than the anime was at following the story).

However, even if you watch the anime or read the manga, it's difficult to understand all of Tsukihime, because it was originally a dating/hentai game, and those games have a lot of different story paths/branches so that unless you play through it and do different things every time, you won't understand the entire story. :O

...Fortunately, it's possible to just read the summations/walkthrough for the game. XD

"event","[OOC Note: I'd like to point out, that I made a mistake when I sent this in.  Kohaku's blood type is actually type B, not A. :O]



<b>Character:</b> Kohaku
<b>Series:</b> <a
href=http://www.geocities.com/max3075/top.htm>Tsukihime</a>
<b>Character Age:</b> 18
<i><font size=""-2"">Canon: Kohaku is the older half of twin sisters who act as maids for the rich Tohno family.  At first glance, Kohaku is cheerful, and very upbeat.  Always speaking cutely, and happily attending to her work with a smile. ...But the truth is, this is all a facade. Her smiles and good cheer are completely false emotions, hiding a deep obsession with revenge against the family she serves. The reasons being that she was abused by them when she was a child living there.  Kohaku has no qualms with using any means to achieve her goals, including poisoning, controlling others through the use of hallucinogens (which she knows how to create because of her training as a doctor), intentionally deceiving those who would be kind to her, giving people the means to kill others, provoking others into killing, etc. (The one exception is using her sister, Hisui, who she wants to keep apart from all of her madness.) Deep down though, she's not a truly evil person.  But she's been deceiving herself and others for such a long time, she knows no other way to live.
 
She wears an oriental style kimono, and is rarely seen without her traditional Japanese broom in her hand (partially because she hides a sword in it).</font></i>
 
<b>Sample Post: </b>
Gooooooood evening, cute ladies and elegant gentlemen!  This maid is humbly referred to as Kohaku!  I'm eighteen years old, my blood type is type A, and my hobby is video games (my favorite is House of the Dead... don't tell anyone!!).  My skills are cooking, cleaning, and anything related to traditional Japanese culture. If you need a koto player, origami lesson, tea ceremony mistress, or <s>hara kiri</s> go partner, look no further!  Please be nice to me!
 
I can see I arrived none too soon.  How messy!  Torsos, limbs, and intestines... oh my! And that's just the kitchen! This cute and devoted maid doesn't know where to begin! But, hmm... Maybe...
 
That's not blood all over the floor... it's spilled red wine!  And those entrails someone could carelessly trip and fall in to?  It's all the cooking ingredients I've been buying today!  A-ha ha... my arms were so tired from carrying them such a long way, I spilled such a large amount of them!  But even if it's spoiled already, I know the perfect herbs that'll mask the taste, and with so much food in stock, everyone will be eating happily for months!  Kohaku is too smart! <font color=""red"">&hearts;</font>
 
Ara-ra? Elegant Gentleman, sir, don't you know better than to come in doors without wiping your feet? You're only tracking in more red wine! My broom will always have that flavor at this rate! You've made me so mad! Uwaaaah!
 
...Falling-apart Gentleman?  There's no need to lose your head over something so simple as a slap to the face.  Men should take the traditional feminine punishment with a smile!  A maid's cooking area is very delicate, after all, and if anyone were allowed to just disturb all of the cooking utensils I had set out to use, I'd never be able to stop cleaning--  Headless Gentleman, sir! By all accounts, shouldn't your head being separated from your body have killed you by now? It's very rude to ignore a decapitation, even unintentional!
 
...Ah, could it possibly be, this camp has something of a <i>Zombie Panic?</i>
 
Oh, what a beautifully complicated problem for this maid to deal with! I can expand my repertoire from dealing with virtual to real life <i>Zombie Madness!</i> (This cute maid has a killer aim, you know!)  Uwee hee!  I'm going to have so much to do here, almost as much back at home! But first, that recipe-- Put the delicious meat on the board... meat tastes so much better after it's tenderized!  Ooh, don't forget to make a sauce...
 
Kohaku's Pot Roast Surprise, with tangy red wine sauce (type O, I think), will be ready at 6:00 pm!  Don't miss the nice dinner I'm cooking for all of you! <font color=""red"">&hearts;</font>"

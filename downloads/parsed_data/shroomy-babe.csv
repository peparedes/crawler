"event","so yeah i never took another test but o well. im going to be leaving town in a few days ill be gone for a few weeks i just need to break away from all this drama and bullshit that surrounds me everywhere i just cant break free of it. At last im finally free to see the world and to bring down chaos to this miserable planet hahahaha j/k or am i? hhmm makes you wonder huh im mean really whats going to happen to this planet in the next couple of years, some ppl beleive that its going to end in the year 2012 and yes its true i will be the bringer of destruction muuuahahahaha anywayz dont mind me there so yeahall this chaos thats already happening the hurricanes and the storms and the strange weather.  Ok have any of you seen Day after tommorrow- might i say a great film a little exagerated but yeah thats about it. Think about that happening but over a course af a few years and you get the future actually its already starting to happen and its a little late but for the most part everything should be right on schedule.  I guess we all find out the hard way and im sure nasa and the rest of the fucking stupid government they like to leave things out when they speak to the public but we are all going to die if we dont get off this planet.  well ill talk more about it later i gotta get back to work so keep an open mind buh bye

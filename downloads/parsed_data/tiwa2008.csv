"event","so some of us went to see the history movie last night haha yeah okay it was a really good and well made movie, but you deff get why its rated R haha the violent parts are like beyond...

i felt like a little kid at a scary movie haha my hands were like over my eyes with little gaps between my fingers so im still looking, but barely haha yeah zito was laughing at me at times...

one part... was SOOOOOO gross it was like eeewwwww and i was like omfg and even zito was like holy hell... it was like people will all the insides out and like they didn't have skin it was disgusting and then he asks me if the people were american or japenese... yeah like i was even looking...

before the movie was pretty fun... miller, larry, ryder, brad, ricky, and i went to mary's house but ricky had to leave

mary and i played larry and brad in fuseball... we DOMINATED three games in a row! haha it was simply amazing...i scored as goaly haha it was pretty amazing, but mary made a lot of the goals cuz she's just that good... brad was good at aufense haha we tried to keep the little ball away from him cuz if he had it there was no way you could block it

it was a fun time, but now its homework time... which sucks"

he was like my dad in the winter... i spent more time with him than with my family during the season and now he's going to brooklyn

I always loved blackwell and williams going in the gym together... being like HAHA WE'RE GUNNA DOMINATE YOU cuz they're big and are like freaking 2 feet bigger than any other coach...

he was the reason i always felt safe...

so many good memories over the years...

haven't cried in two years and i cried twice today... thats crazy.. shelby's seen me cry 4 times in the like 14 years i've known her and two of them were today

haha at the end of the day shelby and i were standing in the gym hall crying and like all the bball guyz went by haha...
jonny gave us a big hug
larry hugged/patted each of us
santino tried to make us feel better by joking and making funny faces haha it kinda worked
like 5 of them said that blackwell wasn't dying he was just moving away
and then we got many sympathetic looks
williams gave us big hugs... thank god he's not leaving!

at break when shelby and i were really crying in his office with the guyz, jon balderston, and thomas they were allllll staring at us... haha they'd seen shelby cry but they'd never seen me cry


today was a pretty shit day

"event","June 21 was a day that i'm sure 6 of us will never forget...shelby's sweet 16 of course! shaina and I had been planning her surprise since january when we first stepped into becca's oh so fabulous limo! We knew her parents wouldn't get her a limo so we decided to! well a couple days before the big event it seemed like everything was falling apart... we didn't have a limo, shaina's mom wouldn't pay, my mom wasn't home, josh didn't have a credit card, cory and josh were complaining about the cost. cory was trying to get a deal on a limo, and we didn't know if larry could come. Shaina and I both broke down and were crying because we'd tried so hard. She had to go to weggies for some things and then cody was going there so I said i'd try another limo company...Excel was a whole lot cheaper than S&S and everyone was happy with the amount they were gonig to have to pay. Even josh and cory stopped complaining and we found out LARRY COULD COME!

We had our ""fam"" (cory, larry, shaina, and I) and josh come to shaina's house for the limo ride and then we would be taken to shelby's for the big surprise. I had called mr hill many a times to make sure he knew and so did mrs. hill what the hills had forgotten to tell the rest of the fam that yes josh was indeed coming... josh had told shelby that he couldn't come because he had soccer (my idea haha) Shelby had gotten mad at us because we were always texting and calling each other... she accused us of cheating on her haha but it was all clear to her later.

When we were almost at shelby's house we made josh get out and hide behind a bush and then cory, larry, shaina and I watched as shelby came out the door and looked like she was about to pee her pants... well shaina and I watched haha we made the two boyz duck down... cory didn't stay down though... he sat up and looked at larry and then screamed ""LARRY'S TRYING TO GIVE HIMSELF HEAD!"" hahaha gotta love brothers... Shel entered the limo and then told shaina and I that she thought we were trying to get josh outa soccer and we said we were sorry and we couldn't. We then got into the limo and turned the corner to find josh shelby looked like she was gunna pee her pants again and screamed. It was the best eveerrrr

we took her out for ice cream in canandaigua...shaina and i paid.

Cory and Larry were acting soooo gay it was hilarious! it was a little more than ""brotherly love"", but it was really funny... josh even started playing a long after awhile, but shelby's cousin tyler ... well i think he's scarred for life now haha

It was all together a very fun night!


I've been in virginia since the 22nd til yesterday. We went to my dad's younger brother first...we watched a lot of movies. I never knew how much I love the movie what a girl wants! Oliver James is hott and HE SINGS! i'm in love haha

We then went to my mom's younger brother's house. My two cousins Kristylee(older) and Carrielynn( younger)  are gorgeous...can't lie...  the older one won homecoming queen and miss virginia high and the younger one won prom queen... I got to try on their dresses that they'd won! the older one had been in all sorts of beauty comps so they had like 30 dresses! I got to take 2 home! my aunt says I can keep them! I'm all set for prom!! haha I'm excited! I have a dress and a date...im set! haha now all i have to do is plan it with shaina, dillon, and olivia! haha and of course.... mr cruz

But my heart was lying
I'm not a child any longer
I am stroooongerrrr

Here's where I stand,

Help me, to move on but please don't tell me how
I'm on my way, I'm moving out

~hmm talkin about fri. it was santino makes fun of akira day... haha during 3rd, break, 8th, and 9th...i think he mighta mentioned it after the game, but i wasn't really paying attention haha... here are some examples...

""HE LOOKS RETARDED!! take it off! it makes him look retarded!!! u deff spent a lot more time on nicks... UR SLACKING ON UR MANAGING DUTIES!! IM TELLING!!!"" - santino

after i take it off... ""wat should i put?!"" - me   ""put YAY ETHAN!"" - santino.... haha wow...

at break i was asking brad if larry was gunna come to school cuz i'd talked to him the night before and he said that he would...haha this was santino's response to my question...""he was going to, but then i told him how horrible the card is that u made for ethan and he didn't wanna come anymore...""

then thomas started making fun of the pic too and i told them he was doin ball drills and santino goes... no he's not HOLDING the ball he's DROPPING the ball... ya its not my fault i only had one pic left on the carmera and thats wat he happened to b doing!! haha

after math thomas and santino started to make fun of me YET AGAIN because i was tellin sam about how im stupid and to shoot me now cuz i figured out the problem on the math test and then didn't do the last step

finally shaina caitlin mary brie and i were sittin on one side of the lounge and santino thomas and ricky were on the other side and ricky goes... this is the NONproblem side... and they started saying wat all our problems were and for me santino goes MAKING A BAD CARD FOR ETHAN!!

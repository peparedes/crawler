     The world forgetting, by the world forgot.
     Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!

I love Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  I watched it twice over the weekend, and tonight i was happy that Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry won the oscar for best original screenplay. yess. I also went to see Finding Neverland this weekend (by myself, because I'm a loser) and i thought that Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet did a wonderful job.  It was a cute and sad movie and i enjoyed it. :-) So that's about it.  My parents will be getting back from Las Vegas tomorrow night and i have to go pick them up at the airport...yay.  This bird that we recently got is evil and i want to let him fly away outside...... goodnight"

"event","I just finished watching ""Pretty in Pink"" starring Molly Ringwald, James Spader (sexy), Jon Cryer (cute), and Andrew McCarthy (i think thats his name). I love 80s movies. I just bought it today at Best Buy for ten dollars. I want to watch it again RIGHT NOW!...but it's late and I should be getting to bed if I want to get up at nine tomorrow and watch Regis and Kelly (because Sarah Michelle Gellar, aka Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is going to be on the show...) ahh. I also bought a Bright Eyes CD and The Killers CD, Hot Fuss. I really like the Killers, yes I do.  yep. 

Tomorrow I'm going to Madison to visit Lenny!!! ""I'm so excited"" as I always am, so yeah, it's going to be a fun time.  One last fun time before I go back to school...not looking forward to it, but there's nothing I can do, so oh well.  I got my books today--very heavy.  yes.  

I'm going to sleep now...hopefully.  Tomorrow is going to be so much fun..."

"event","Today I rode with Lenny and his parents to take him back to Madison :-(  I don't want classes to start, it's too cold to walk outside to class....brrr.  Anyway, tomorrow I have to go to the high school and Stevens Point and have them send my transcripts to Madison--I hope i get in! I'm already excited to have my own (kinda) apartment and all that fun stuff.  Yep.  I'll have to admit that I'll probably be homesick for awhile, but it has to be done.  My aunt brought her puppy over tonight and I think it's really cute (my mom thinks its ugly) but it's only 3 months old and its fuzzy and brown and white with floppy ears.  It looks like a baby Sugar, but it's some other kind of dog..idk. 
      I hope I can get a good-paying full-time job this summer.  I'm hoping to get a job at Fulton, in Mosinee. My shift would be from 6am to 2pm every weekday--pretty early, but I would have my afternoons and nights free, so that's a plus.  And I think it pays nine dollars starting, or maybe more?  I want to make a lot of money this summer so I'll have money saved up to pay all my housing next year (if I get into Madison) Which I figure will need to be about $5,000...which there's no way I'll make that much, but yeah, i have a lot in my checking acct. still so i'll make it. yep im going to sleep now..."

"event","I haven't applied to Madison yet, and the deadline is February 1st.  I already feel like I'm not going to get in, and I'm really mad at myself for not applying sooner.  I tried typing my ""personal letter"" part of my application online, and it's all shit.  I can't write it.  Whatever I write sounds phony or lame.  I'm so frustrated right now because of this.  I have to get this application sent in tomorrow, I'm sick of putting it off.  I really want to get in next year, and I kinda need to know if I'm accepted or not before summer, so I know if I need to find a place to live next year.  So much pressure.  This whole college thing is frightening--all that knowledge I need to consume...So much competition, I hate it. I need some help and I think that Lenny should help me--at least help me get one good starting paragraph.  I just really need to get this done.  I also have to call Stevens Point and find out how I send my transcripts to Madison, if I can do it online, and how all that crap works.  Ick.  
   I'm really sick of winter.  I wish it was summer and this horrible upcoming semester was over with.  

...oh and lenny, I think you should find your cell phone now :-)"

"event","I finally made lenny shower-he hasn't showered in 3 days and that's kinda gross. I don't want to go back to school, I'm never going to get up that early, I can barely get up at 10--and I have 8am chem labs on Mondays, so I'll probably be getting up at 630 or something like that. yuck.  anyway, this semester is going to be hard, with me having 5 classes and 17 credits. yuck."

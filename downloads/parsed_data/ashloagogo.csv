"event","When I was little, I never really thought about it. We were all little and innocent and weren't faced with anything worth asking : What Would Jesus Do? Now, I realize that I'm asking myself this more and more. I'm faced with more challenges in my faith. I question things that I've believed my entire life! Then I&nbsp;realize that it all boils down to one question: What would Jesus do?"

I'm in love. I met someone on the tailend of the last girl and she's blwom me away like no one before. She means everything to me. 

My schoolwork has taken priority over my life like never before. I'm actually loving what I am learning. I want to add a Philosophy minor. It'll be alot of work but I'm genuinly excited about it. 

I'm one year from graduating and it's scary to think about all I have to do over the next year. I've decided on Law School/ M.A. program so I can one day go on to be a professor. This thought excites me.

I keep drifting toward being an atheist and it's an interesting sensation.

well I'll update more but for now this is good."

Resting on the shoulders of your name.
Do you see the truth through all their lies?
Do you see the world through troubled eyes?
And if you want to talk about it anymore,
Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.

I have seen birth. I have seen death.
Lived to see a lover's final breath.
Do you see my guilt? Should I feel fright?
Is the fire of hesitation burning bright?
And if you want to talk about it once again,
On you I depend. I'll cry on your shoulder.
You're a friend.

You and I have been through many things.
I'll hold on to your heart.
I wouldn't cry for anything,
But don't go tearing your life apart.

I have seen fear. I have seen faith.
Seen the look of anger on your face.
And if you want to talk about what will be,
Come and sit with me, and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.
And if you want to talk about it anymore,
Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend."

I need a job, money is sparse.

I need to get the good grades.

I need to cut back on the extra curricular acctivivies I think. I wanna slow the drinking down and work out more too. 

I its a new year and a new semester, I'm allowed to lie to myself.

I'm know what I need to do with the girl. Be her friend and not act like an idiot (beyond what she is used to) 

All in all its good to be back. I missed my friends and I missed being in class.

Here to a good year."

"event","Tears and Rain
By James Blunt

How I wish I could surrender my soul;
Shed the clothes that become my skin;
See the liar that burns within my needing.
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold.
How I wish I had screamed out loud,
Instead I've found no meaning.

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain.

How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind;
Hold memory close at hand,
Help me understand the years.
How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.
How I wish I would save my soul.
I'm so cold from fear.

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
Far, far away; find comfort in pain.
All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.
It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain."

"event","For the past weeks I have been silently hinting that I have had feelings for someone and I was going to try something.

I'm not going to say who, that person knows and I think in the end is what I wanted. 

I gambled and I didn't lose per se. I just didn't win. The week before break I was working on three things, finals, a poem and a letter. 
I got done with finals early.

I've never more energy into two peices of paper in my life. The poem was first, it had to convey what I felt. It had to let her know exactly what she was to me and most importantly I just think she needed to get something written about her that was inspired by her beauty.

The letter was something similar. It basically conveyed how I felt and what she meant to me. It was me venting in a sense and lord knows I needed it, but goddamn if I have ever written something more heartfelt. I haven't. I put every ounce of positive energy I could into that letter, I rewrote it seven times. every word had to be perfect and say it purely and honestly. I have never been more honest.

The act of handing someone a piece of paper that bares your soul to them, opening yourself like that... I have never been as terrified.

She has written me since and we have talked. She appreciated how I felt but cannot return the feelings. I know things could of gone better but atleast I have not entirely ruined what we did have. Who knows. I will this coming semester."

<br><br>
You prefer your romance and love to wild and daring rather than typical
or boring, you would rather pursue than be pursued and, when it comes
to physical love, your satisfaction comes more from providing a
wonderful time to your partner than simply seeking your own.
<br><br>
This places you in the Lover Style of: <b>The Liberated Lover</b>.
<br><br>The Liberated Lover is a wonderful Lover Style, and forms the
kind of free-thinking, sexually-exciting, self-confident lover that
society once condemned but that a liberal-mind cherishes and exults.
The Liberated Lover is a treasure to find, though it can sometimes be
difficult to do so because they are often already engaged in
relationships or are in high-demand if ""in the market.""
<br><br>In terms of physical love, the Liberated Lover is possibly the
most thrilling and demanding of all, with the one potential drawback
being that it is possible to feel 'overmatched' at times by their
prowess and selfless giving. Given trust and understanding, and the
right lover, the Liberated Lover can be a delight in bed.
<br><br>
Best Compatibility can probably be found with: The Exotic Lover (most of all) or the Carnal Lover, or the Suave Lover.
<br><br>
Congratulations!

I on the other hand did just fine. I was obviously not thinking straight because I tossed my keys to Luke and ran off with the boys, fun times.

I've been slacking on the writing in the journal, helps me keep sane I guess, even though I'd hardly call my life difficult right now. Maybe that explains the whole lack of writing. I guess thats good.

Takin life easy when I know I should be workin alittle harder but I just can't give too much of a shit right now. I guess I have to start worrying about lawschool here pretty soon, I've decided to go that route because I will make the most money, and I want money so I can have a family that will never worry about money. Take the significant other to places she'd wanna go, Paris, Italy, and mayb China that'd be nice. I wanna travel more and more, I wanna be able to take my Mom out to nice restaruants.

I guess if I wanna do all those things I need to get working on my homework, so I can get to Lawschool.

There's strange thoughts in my brain, I don't know what to think.
You get what you should pay for, 
But what are my intentions with this...

I need a hopeful smile,
I need a heartbeat,
I miss a heartbreak,
I miss what I wasn't,

It's snowing in Omaha, and nothing is the same.
Theres pains I remember, smiles I forgot.
I miss you, I wonder what you think of me..

I wish it was a small world,
Cuz I dream about a girl a star away,
I'm finding I can always hear the wind blow when I feel lonely for the guitar, 

I guess it's time to put my head down,
Cuz the cold make me so tired,
I need a heartbeat, 
I really need a heartbeat...."

"event","I am doing all these quizzes for a reason, I am trying to figure me out. Ok, so the zombie one was all for me but still these quizzes (pathetically enough) help me see how I percieve myself.

More than one really close friend has told me that I do not have a ""type"" of woman that interests me. That is not an incorrect observation. I wonder if that is bad. A good friend of mine has told me that isn't, yet it seems to annoy others.

Honestly it doesnt always bother me, but I am not the guy who dates women because I can no matter what people think. I am and have always been able to find the beauty in a woman. They are the most amazing creatures, and I think they are the best thing on this planet. I don't think women know how wonderful they are.

I am a romantic but it seems to die alittle more inside me everyday. I'm not going all emo (yes I am) but it is how I feel. 

I am sorry to every girl I've gone out with and broken up with. I believe they are good wonderful people, but I was not the man for them because I was not willing to give the what they deserved because I was not willing to give that part of myself to them. I wanted to date all of them because they were fun/cute and made me smile. I never looked past that, I didn't get together with someone because I planned on marrying them, my problem is I start to think about it, realize I dont want to marry them and end it because I don't want to waste there time and mine. I've hurt people that didn't deserve it, and I will not forgive myself for it.

I just want love and it is so hard for me to allow it into my life anymore. I dont want to get hurt. A wiser person than I said I have to be willing to get hurt to fall in love, one day maybe Ill grow up and allow that.

I wan't to figure this out before I Hhurt someone who is becoming increasingly (nothing major yet) important in my life.

<TD>Leader of the Gauls, a chieftain of the Arverni. He was the leader of the great revolt against the Romans in 52 BC. Julius Caesar, upon hearing of the trouble, rushed to put it down. Vercingetorix was, however, an able leader and adopted the policy of retreating to heavy, natural fortifications and burning the Gallic towns to keep the Roman soldiers from living off the land. Caesar and his chief lieutenant Labienus lost in minor engagements, but when Vercingetorix shut himself up in Alesia and summoned all his Gallic allies to attack the besieging Romans, the true brilliance of Caesar appeared. He defeated the Gallic relieving force and took the fortress. Vercingetorix was captured and, after gracing Caesar's triumphal return to Rome, was put to death. </TD></TR>

<P>You seem to enjoy big eyes, small other features, and a sexy demeanor. I actually skewed Keira toward <B style=""COLOR: #ff7e7e"">cute</B> in the test, due to the specific pic, but generally she's pretty <B style=""COLOR: #cc0000"">sexy</B> indeed.

I came back to some sad news. Well not really sad but it makes me kinda.. no it makes me sad it does. I thought someone might of been able to overlook something, something that I couldnt be and she couldnt. She hasnt said anything but maybe she will. I dunno, makes me feel really lonely right now for some reason even though there is nothing to feel lonely about. Maybe there is. I will never be able to comprehend Religion.

Another note I dont feel lonely now that I think about it. I have a kindred spirit, no I'm not with said person but it is nice to hear someone say they are similar to you. That someone thinks and feels like you. I dunno if thats good but it makes me less... alone? 

I am trying not to dissect this, any of this. I'm honestly to busy to care, but it doesnt make me think about it any less.

Atleast I have God??

I dunno."

I feel that writing in my journal may reveal more than I care to people. I don't know why but I've been more ande more reserved with my emotions. I think I am afraid of getting hurt more than I have been in awhile. Perhaps it is because I am interested in someone. I dunno. I can't read her and it is driving me crazy. I can usually tell what people are feeling and thinking but not this one. maybe thats what I need, if she even returns the feeling. 

I want love but I don't. I want to have a wife but I want to love her. I want my degree, and I want to be rich. I think what I mainly want is to be happy.

I think I'm forgetting what it is that made me happy.

<TR>
<TD>You are the Smartass! You are rational, extroverted, brutal, and arrogant. You probably consider people who are emotional and gentle to be big pussies who are obviously in lesser stature than you. You have many flaws, despite your seeming intelligence and cool-headedness. For instance, you aren't very nice. In fact, you're probably an asshole. And you are conceited and self-centered. Not only that, but you are very loud and vocal about all this, seeing as how you are extroverted. There is no better way to describe you than as a ""smartass"", I'm afraid. Perhaps just ""ass"" would do, too. But that's a little less literary and descriptive. At any rate, your main personality defect is the fact that you are self-centered, mean, uncaring, and brutally logical. 
<P>
<P><B>To put it less negatively:</B> 
<P><I>1. You are more RATIONAL than intuitive. 
<P>2. You are more EXTROVERTED than introverted. 
<P>3. You are more BRUTAL than gentle. 
<P>4. You are more ARROGANT than humble.</I> 
<P>
<P><B>Compatibility:</B>

<P>* 
<P>* 
<P><I>If you scored near fifty percent for a certain trait (42%-58%), you could very well go either way. For example, someone with 42% Extroversion is slightly leaning towards being an introvert, but is close enough to being an extrovert to be classified that way as well.

Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times but somehow
I want more

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile

"event","It has been entirely too long since I've made an entry. This helps me with stress and getting my thoughts in order. That describe why I have been this way for awhile. I have not been opening up to people. I have been somewhat detached, even moreso when I was dating Rhea. I find that I just don't care anymore. 

A student on campus was trying to do something good by trying to have students Speak out for those who couldnt. It is usually something I can get behind but lately I'm so dissillusioned with everything I can't muster up any real emotion toward it.

The only thing making me happy right now is studying. I am also looking forward to Thanksgiving break. I need to see my stinktwon friends. I can be apathetic and still have fun. 

My grades are terrible this semester, I got a C + on a world history test. I got back a test in Public Policy to find I have gotten yet another B in this class, I am disgusted with my peformance. I have too many obligations and I am not focused.

I have been drinking entirely too much for my taste. I used to do it once a week at most, now I've drank three times in the last 7 days, two of which I got trashed. I had fun but I just wonder if I'm taking a path that will end up screwing me up. 

I have worked out extensively for the first time. I got in a full body work out, legs, arms, abs. I feel good about it. I be fucking sore tomarrow but I don't care. There still is time for me to stop this odd downward spiral I seem to be taking. 

For the first time in awhile I'm not proud of who I am. I'm not confident anymore. I know the only person doing this to me is me. So I turn it around and stop bitching. I'm working out, stop the drinking for awhile. Get to work on the grades especially. Things will be good, I just need to keep at it.

Maybe I need Jesus or Allah....Bhudda?"

"event","It has definatly been awhile.

I am basically wasting as much time as possible before I get down and study. 

Today was a busy day. The Advocates are getting close to there first presentation with Dr. Leeper. I am getting more and more stressed about it because it's really important to me that this succeeds.  I dunno why I just am in this mindset that I cannot take the dissapointment.

I believe this to go back to my relationship life, or lack there of. Not that I am looking, I have found a qoute that rings true though. ""Looking back on all your failed relationships, the one thing they have in common is you."" I wonder and worry about the next relationship and feel that it will fail as all the others have. Yes I am definatly setting myself up for dissapointment. I feel dissapointed in myself that I cannot have a successful relationship, it is somewhat bothering to me. I find myself envious of those that have had a relationship longer than 5 months, this is silly of course but I feel like venting.

I can't even remember love making me feel good. It just brings anger anymore, I think I never even gave myself the chance to enjoy the feeling knowing that the love will not work, or I am just far too impatient. I don't know what to do. The more I feel this the angrier I am getting. The worst thing is I'm letting this get in the way of far more important things such as school and finding a job. 

I think I should say something because it needs to be discussed. If I do it may ruin everything and change things for the worst. I am letting it eat at me but maybe this is better. I know she knows. She's ignoring it, in either an attempt to make things better or to make sure everything doesnt get ruined. This is hell."

I am unsure of how to proceed because I havent been like this in forever. I cannot tell anyone because if I do it will ruin everything. It's really not that bad, but considering my past I wish it wasn't this way. 

I know for the first time how I really feel, and it will probly end poorly. I'd say I need a drink but I know I don't. In fact I don't wanna drink for awhile. 

I wonder if I'm trying to run from my problem, it is not something I do usually. Is this really as serious as I am making it out to be? 

I probly need a grilfriend, that usually distracts me for a couple months. I would just end up where I was though...

My life is a goddamn contradiction. 

I'll tell you what though. I don't like secrets. The funny thing is I hide them constantly. This one lasted about a day before it blew up in my face multiple times. Many were mad, including a close friend who had nothing to do with it. Understand this, I don't include people who don't need to know espcially when I was told not to, more secrets. I don't want anyone else to suffer drama, its not necissary. I know what is necissary and what isn't. I don't do things to be a jerk, you wanna trust me? Trust me on this. 

Don't be mistaken on this, I'm not mad at anyone outside myself. You did nothing wrong. You cared and thats admirable. Just know I am a harsh person, I'm not proud of it but its me. You'll learn in time, if you don't want to be my friend because of it? Fine. You'll be better off anyways. Don't make me bring out my bad side.

I do this because someone I care greatly about is threatend, I will not tolerate this person having anymore shit thrown at them. Don't make me take sides, you'll only lose."

I got to see people I like, hung out with Clark alittle while and he is feeling better. Apparently people are dating I didn't know where dating but thats fine. It's good for them and none of my business. Luke and I wrote a decent column out of thin air. I like it I do.

Downside is I had to drive to Omaha around dusk and I am the worst night driver if no one is with me. I have a tendency to fall asleep, but this time I did ok. Nodded off once, stopped at a gas station and bought some NO-Doze. My aunt is no longer mad at me, she had her beloved dog put to sleep and now all she is doing is crying. I'm no good at helping people when they are like that. Case in point one of my friends was in a mood tonight. I don't handle it well when people take out there moods on others, I was the brunt of this and was handling it ok because that person didn't know I was about to verballly decapatate them. Not that I'm sure I could ever bring myself to do this to this person but still. I somewhat yelled on msn but they apologized anyways. For some reason it didn't feel like enough, which is me being bitchy and an unforgiving prick (ask Clark!!)

I don't want to start this cycle again, in reality I just want to date someone, not seriously but a date. I wouldnt be against dating multiple women, it would probly do me good. But how do you go about asking out a friend or two for just a date? Hmmmm, I think it would be weird. I suggested it to Kate in passing, and I have no feelings for Kate I just thought it would be fun. She thought it would be to weird. I think she is right. So do I ask one of my other female friends? Maybe someone I am familiar with enough but not friends. I don't want to go around asking every girl I know, I'm not desperate.

Better Days


And you ask me what I want this year
And I try to make this kind and clear
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days
Cuz I don't need boxes wrapped in strings
And desire and love and empty things
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

So take these words
And sing out loud
Cuz everyone is forgiven now
Cuz tonight's the night the world begins again

And it's someplace simple where we could live
And something only you can give
And thats faith and trust and peace while we're alive
And the one poor child that saved this world
And there's 10 million more who probably could
If we all just stopped and said a prayer for them

So take these words
And sing out loud
Cuz everyone is forgiven now
Cuz tonight's the night the world begins again

I wish everyone was loved tonight
And somehow stop this fight
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

So take these words
And sing out loud
Cuz everyone is forgiven now
Cuz tonight's the night the world begins again

""I just felt like running"" Yeah I got my toenails painted, and then I put on Clarks pants and glasses and ran around like an idiot. Everyone laughed so its all good. I like to  make people laugh, I especially like to make girls laugh. I love a womans laugh I think it is the prettiest and sexiest sound in the world. Hmmm. I think I will enjoy being single for awhile. I havent done that and maybe I should. I can enjoy pretty faces without feeling guilty. I can hang out with someone and not worry if I make someone jealous. I can also tend to be less selfish when I'm single because I don't concentrate on one person. I also don't have a person that I am paticularly interested in right now either. It is kind of like being free I guess.
But I do feel alittle bit lonely I think. I like that I guess, I appreciate people more that way. Perhaps the loneliness comes from the fact that I can't seem to find that ""one"". I know I don't give girls a chance but In all reality I would know if I want to be with someone. That one of my ""talents"" I think. 
But how to choose someone? I can't just say I have a good time with her, because then I'd have a list as long as my leg of girls I have a good time with. Pretty faces don't help but almost all my freinds tha are girls are pretty. So should I just be more selective? Clark would say yes, but I don't think I would want to be where he is right now. I think it should be someone I'm not friesnds with, someone who shares many common interests perhaps. I dunno. I don't think I'm gonna worry about it, I'm still running around in Clarks pants in my mind. 

But always a thought."

"event","Well everyone I've run across today seems to be having problems. I worry most about the ones I know are pushing what they're feeling down. That worries me when peole do that. But then again I'm at the point of not caring for some of them (not ALL mind you). Some people know what they need to do but can't because of what they feel, and that seems to be the main problem actually. I havent felt like that in so long I think I forgot what it feels like. I'm not complaining actually because I hated it. Hmmm, there's alittle insight into what they are feeling I guess. 
too bad.."

"event","Some know, some don't. Rhea and I have ended our relationship. It sucks because I realized today that I believe I have been giving away small pieces of my heart everytime  i break it off with someone. The good thing is Rhea is awesome, we talked to today and I believe I have a friend. That is good. The bad thing is I keep doing this. I do this so much, people joke about it and I do to...But I am setting myself up for failure from the get go. No one will ever be good enough because i will not let them be. I never ever give them the chance, and at this rate there will not be any women left to date. I hear I'll find someone, and I believe I will. Four months later I will dump them. 

Along time ago I was in love more than I ever thought capable. It made me want to be a better person and achieve greatness all for this woman. I would of done anything, and I mean anything for this woman. I became the worst person anyone could ever know, and all because of love. I hated myself because of it in the end. Now I cannot trust love or anyone I can potentially love. I'll never give myself the chance to be hurt like that again... I'm not saying I am conciously doing it, its like alcholism, I can't help it. I trick myself into thinkin it won't work and magically it doesnt. 

Maybe I know what I want all along, and thats the problem."

"event","A long day has ended finally. I did what I had convinced myself I needed to do. Now I am alone, which I guess was the plan. I hate myself for any hurt I caused Rhea, even though she smiled and hugged me. She is awesome.
IF I am lucky we will be friends for along time to come. 

I guess that is all I have to say about that..."

"event","We're gonna recap Friday first. We went out and had a ball at the bar. Clark gor wasted, 9 pitchers of beer will do that, plus shots. Who know how many, he kept giving out different numbers. Aime got drunk, Rhea got drunk and Racheal ""won"" the drunk contest by getting more wasted than everyone. I was buzzing nicely as well.  Good times, everyone was down there. Had trouble sleeping, didn't fall asleep until around 4ish. Did things I wasn't proud of. 

Most fractured Saturday ever. I got two hours of sleep the night before, woke up at 6:45 and drove to USD to take a practice LSAT. FUCK, the LSAT is a bitch. I kept wanting to have an anerism. But God just wouldnt let me. Hung over (alittle, its worse with less sleep) exhausted, and beating myself up inside all the while trying to plow through this monstrosity called the LSAT. It was free and did not include the writing portion...They drag you through 3 hours of testing, fry your brains and THEN expect you to write something. ASSHOLES. I do believe though if I was under better circumstances and I also have a year until I do actually take the real test, I think I will do good. I have a taste now.

In other things.... I just won't post anything until I resolve/figure out what I need to do. I have to play the asshole and do what I am getting so bad at. I hate hurting people, especially good ones."

"event","We got Aime DRUNK. Funny stuff. Much funnier because I don't feel I have to babysit her, there were like 10 people watching her, including Rhea. Aime helped me ot with Rhea when Rhea had her big 21 so the favor was returned.

Anyways good night."

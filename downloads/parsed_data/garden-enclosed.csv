"event","I haven't been updating this journal, and it has been preying on my mind.  I'd plead bad health, but that has been only part of it.  The biggest part was that until I processed some <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/7326.html"">ongoing angst</a>, I couldn't even <i>think</i> about my garden, much less write about it.

I'm torn on how to handle the ongoing weed-whacking issue.  It seems like I just barely nurse the plants back to health before they're cut down again.  Part of me says to just give up on the wildflowers -- that its cruel to the plants to keep giving them hope and then killing them off.  And part of me wants to put up a sign saying to leave my plants alone.  

The thing is that I have repeatedly spoken with my landlady about this, and I can't decide if the weed whacking is the result of passive-aggressive bitchery, or if she just doesn't care enough to tell the yard guy.  If it is the first, there isn't much I can do about it.  If it is the second, <a href=""http://www.yougrowgirl.com/thedirt/2007/07/19/please-dont-destroy-my-garden-no-more/#more-912"">putting up a sign</a> (in both English and Spanish) saying that these are <i>flowers</i>, not weeds, and to please leave them alone, might just do the trick.  The thing that makes me lean toward the latter idea is that, when the plants begin to bud or reach a certain size, they seem to be safe while everything around them gets cut down.

Any advice? What do you think -- shall I put up a sign, or give up the ghost?"

"event","Dear landlady,

I know this is hardly a new refrain, but please do not instruct the yard guy to <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/4801.html"">weed whack my wildflowers</a>.  I asked you last year.  I asked you earlier this year.  And now I have concluded that you're just ignoring me.  You've said that you ""like the color"" the wildflowers bring -- well, the color doesn't happen <i>when you kill the plants</i>.  I hate to use logic on you, but thats just the way it is.  If you don't want the wildflowers there, then you should tell me that, instead of passive-aggressively trying to kill them.


No Love,


Me


I know I'm not the only one to have dealt with <a href=""http://www.yougrowgirl.com/thedirt/2008/06/04/the-one-where-i-got-my-heart-broken-again/"">a plant destroying landlord</a>, but it feels like it takes a chunk out of my heart every time it happens.  And every time, I give a little more thought to just giving up on the wildflowers."

"event","I have had people ask about the state of my garden this year, and I am woefully behind in making an update.  <lj-cut text=""So this is a photo-heavy and somewhat long entry"">

To remind you all of <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/garden2.jpg"">my space</a>, it is basically a sideyard, bounded by a <i>very ugly</i> fence on one side and the side of the house on the other.  It is a fairly sunny space, and the area that isn't the path is this ugly, ugly light gray gravel that is pretty much designed to reflect the sunlight onto the wall of the house (which is <i>delightful</i> in the Southern California summertime, let me tell you).  This image is accurate in terms of dimension, but the small Sago palm in along the wall in the image has been taken out, but the small paved ""trash can area"" (ugh!) near the gate is still there.

Along the fence side of the garden, I have planted lantana and creeping fig to try and cover up the gravel and thus keep some of the heat out of the house  It is doing pretty well:

<br><center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/LantanaFig.jpg""></center><br>

I have also planted some hosta and random bulbs in amongst the plants on that side.  The calla lilies are coming up rather nicely:

<br><center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/Callas.jpg""></center><br>

But generally, my garden is a container garden, and it is mostly arranged along the wall of the house.  I have quite a number of geraniums (the red and white are looking tatty at the moment, so no pics of them right now), but my Martha Washington geraniums are blooming really well at the moment.

<br><center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/MWGeraniums.jpg""></center><br>

I actually have two Martha Washingtons -- both white and purple.  I put them at opposite endsd of the garden, and I think they bring a nice symmetry to it.

<br><center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/Geranium2.jpg""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/Geranium1.jpg""></center><br>

Aside from my geraniums I have other plants.  My favorites at the moment are my two (identical) containers of strawberries:

<br><center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/Strawberries.jpg""></center><br>

You can see one of my scented geraniums in the background of that photo.  I got the berries on clearance at Target, and I spent $6 for 30 plants.  They are doing quite well -- putting out new leaves and even some runners, but I have yet to see any blossoms yet.  Nice as the plants are, they are in my garden for the fruit.  Any advice on making them bloom?

My Aloe are also going great guns.  When I wasn't looking, one of them went and had a cluster of baby aloe:

<br><center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/BabyAloe.jpg""></center><br>

I have decided to try for a scented garden this year, so I have jasmine (and a very ghetto looking scaffolding for it to climb on:

<br><center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/Scaffolding.jpg""></center><br>

Since the star jasmine doesn't bloom as long as I'd like, I planted a potato flower vine plant in with them, to keep things looking all blossom-y and pretty all spring and summer.

<br><center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/PotatoVine.jpg""></center><br>

To keep up with the scented theme, I have planted sweet alyssum all around the garden.  I have both the white and the midnight purple varietals.

<br><center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/Alyssum.jpg""></center><br>

The wildflower garden is doing nicely, too.  The Copa de Oro Poppies seem to really like the rocky little slope they're on.

<br><center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/CalPoppies.jpg""></center><br>

The rest of the garden has a lot of daisies and marigolds in it.  The red poppies that did so well last year aren't really in evidence this year, but maybe they are just late.

"event","Wow --- I hadn't realized that it had been so long since I updated this journal.  I guess I got burnt out after the <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/5730.html"">fiasco with the roses</a>.  I'm still gardening, though.  My <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/5002.html"">wildflower garden</a> is doing nicely -- after people finally learned that the plants were there intentionally, and were not to be pulled up, weed-whacked or otherwise maligned.  I'll have to get some pictures up to show you.

This year, I have given up on planting most food plants -- my <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/5482.html""> experiments with tomatoes</a> have not turned out very well.  I'm going mostly for a scent garden this year, planting <a href=""http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/230/index.html"">alyssum</a> (in both white and blue/purple varieties), <a href=""http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/55230/"">star jasmine</a>, <a href=""http://www.discoverplants.com/plant-types/shrubs-and-bushes/gardenia/gardening.php"">gardenia</a> and <a href=""http://www.thegardenhelper.com/Lathyrus.htm"">sweet peas</a>.  I'm going to try and shade the side of house for this summer with <a href=""http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/893/"">moonflower</a> and <a href=""http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/774/"">nicotiana</a>, to try and keep some of the heat away.

I already had lavender plants, of both the <a href=""http://www.thegardenhelper.com/Lavandula.html"">English</a> and <a hef=""http://www.mountainvalleygrowers.com/lavdentata.htm"">French</a> varieties -- I may have to add some <a href=""http://www.mountainvalleygrowers.com/lavstochas.htm"">Spanish</a> Lavender to my collection as well.  I think my lavender plants may need to be repotted, though -- they seem to want more scope to grow in.  I have plenty of 12 inch pots, but I think I need some deeper ones.  I'll have to go check out craigslist or something.

The <a href=""http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/2029/"">creeping fig</a> and <a href=""http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/578/"">white lantana</a> are doing fine -- and covering the ugly gravel quite nicely.  I planted some hosta, calla lilies and tulips in among them, and I can see green shoots coming up, so they are coming up, too.  The grasshoppers chewed the bejeezus out of the hosta last year, so I wasn't sure if it would come back -- thankfully, it seems to be.  And of course, I have my collection of various geraniums -- both scented and plain.  This is the ideal location for them, and I have a decent variety (some bought, some gotten by swiping cuttings and rooting them -- hmmm, another post in the making).

It isn't <i>all</i> decorative this year, though.  I got some <a href=""http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/plant.asp?code=N160"">Ft. Laramie</a> varietal strawberries; an ever-bearing self-pollinator -- which means that I can get strawberries all year round and I don't have to worry about the flowers turning into fruit.  It is a hardy varietal that can stand drastic changes in temperature, which makes it popular in the northern part of the US.  However, that characteristic can serve it well in a coastal area, so it is popular in this area, too.  We'll see how those do."

"event","My tomato plant has <a href=""http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/r783101711.html"">Bacterial</a> <a href=""http://vric.ucdavis.edu/veginfo/commodity/tomato/bacspeck.html"">Spot</a>.  I had been worried about its lack of growth, and then it began to get spots on its lower leaves (right where it gets splashed when I water it), leading to yellowing.  I looked it up and, sure enough, I have a sick plant.

So I clipped off the infected leaves, gave the plant a vitamin boost, and sprayed it with an infusion of garlic and milk (and some insecticidal soap to help it stick to the plant) -- so hopefully that'll help it with the bacterial spot, as well as with any fungi or viruses that get any opportunistic ideas.

*sigh*  I know there is still hope, but I had been so looking forward to eating lots of nice, flavorful tomatoes this summer.  Now that is in doubt -- and the plant isn't as big as I had anticipated, either, so there won't be as many of them.

I hope it doesn't spread to either the eggplant or the peppers (which also got vitamins and spray)."

"event","Evidently, <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/4801.html"">spraying milk on the fussy goddamn hybrid tea roses</a> is not acceptable to our neighbor (and landlady's mother).  Never mind that the roses are planted in such a way as to invite powdery mildew infestation, and never mind that those roses are prone to such things anyway.  Milk is <i>food</i>, you understand, and that is why there are insects eating the rose leaves.  (Never mind that there were insects eating the roses before I ever got there with my home remedies)

Everything I do in that stupid rose bed is criticized. I wouldn't have chosen such insipid flowers, and I sure wouldn't have chosen anything as high maintenance as hybrid teas (<i>scentless</i> hybrid teas, too!), but they are there and so I take care of them -- only to be nitpicked at every time I turn around!  If I deadhead the roses, I'm ""killing the flowers"", but if I don't the busybody neighbor (not the landlady's mother, but her friend) comes over and does it for me because R (the landlady's mother) ""deserves pretty flowers"" (gee -- patronizing much?).  When I water, I'm likely to get scolded because the sound of the running water ""is disturbing"", but if I try to time my watering so that nobody is around to be disturbed, then R never sees me watering, and I get well-meaning but insipid, simplistic lectures about ""how roses need to drink, too"".  

It's like being nibbled to death by ducks -- every time I turn around (and no matter what I do), I have somebody making some minor critique of me.  And none of them are enough, individually, to justify me blowing my top, but taken as a whole, they are enough to make me want to take a flamethrower to the whole damn yard!  Especially since <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/1721.html"">""I'll recoup you, no problem""</a> turned into <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/1952.html"">""I'm not going to subsidize your hobby, and why isn't caring for the rose bed enough for you anyway?""</a>  She shoved their care off on me, but nitpicks every time I do the least little thing!

I really, really regret having ""care of the front lawn"" as part of our duties in the lease.  If we stay here, I think I'm going to have to have those duties taken out of the lease.  I refuse to be held responsible for the well-being of plants that the landlady won't let me care for.  One or two suggestions is one thing, but this is like the death of a thousand cuts!"

"event","Dear Lawn Guy,

You seem like a perfectly nice person and all, so I know you aren't doing this on purpose to annoy me, but <i>please</i> refrain from pulling up my wildflowers.  Yes, I know they are planted in gravel -- I planted them there.  They are just now beginning to recover from the <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/4801.html"">weed whacking</a> you gave them a few weeks ago.  It may not be your idea of what a flower bed ought to look like, but I work with what I've got, and actually, I kind of like the result.  Please leave them alone.

Love,

Me

*Sigh*  I spend a lot of time hand-weeding that bed to pull up the real weeds (which he ignored in his last go-round with that bed), and watering it and generally taking care of it.  I wasn't thrilled when the landlady decided to cover that part of the yard with cheap (ugly) crushed granite gravel, but she didn't consult me.  And I am <i>not</i> moving a sideyard full of gravel in order to make a traditional-looking flower bed, either.  The marigolds and poppies seem to be coming up through the gravel just fine (and I sprinkled some more seed around to cover the bare patches left by his unfortunately mistaken weeding -- with our long growing season, it should come up and be okay), and hopefully some other things there will bloom soon, too.  I like my wildflower garden, and I wish people would leave it alone."

"event","Well, the <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/3208.html"">wildflowers in the gravel bed</a> are finally beginning to bud and bloom.  Frankly, I would have expected this a month or so earlier, but their progress certainly wasn't helped by the ""helpfulness"" of the guy who cuts the lawn -- who evidently decided that they were weeds and consequently decided to take the whacker to them about three weeks ago.  And then about six weeks ago, the elderly mother of our landlady decided that the seedlings were weeds and started pulling them.  Half of the wildflower bed is still noticeably thin.  God save my garden from the helpfulness of others!  Anyway, I shook some replacement seed over the bare areas, and hopefully it will come up and fill in the bare patches.  Wildflowers are noticeably hardy -- and I guess springing back from a bout with the weed whacker proves it.

The annoying <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/2268.html"">hybrid tea roses</a> in the front yard are having a case of powdery mildew (again), and may be seeing the beginnings of an aphid infestation (again).  I went to spray milk on them, in order to kill the mildew, but about halfway through, the #@*$&%! sprayer broke.  So I perfunctorally drizzled the rest about and gave up.  I'll get to the rest of it later in the week, when I'm feeling more tolerant of the fussiness of that particular family of roses."

"event","Well, I finally finished my planting <font size=1>(this round of it, anyway -- I'm hoping to plant some flowers in a month or so)</font>.  I planted three long planters of <a href=""http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/2005/2-23-2005/carrots.html"">Short n' Sweet Carrots</a>, and some <a href=""http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/hil/hil-8018.html"">green bunching onions</a> in the pots with my peppers (<a href=""http://www.fiery-foods.com/dave/ancho.html"">ancho</a> and <a href=""http://www.parkseed.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?storeId=10101&catalogId=10101&langId=-1&mainPage=prod2working&ItemId=5270&PrevMainPage=advsearchresults&scChannel=Vegetables%20AS&SearchText=p16.v231;s1.Pepper&OfferCode=T1H"">anaheim</a>) and tomatoes (<a href=""http://www.victoryseeds.com/information/craig_brandywine.html"">red brandywine</a>), so as to discourage incursions of undesireable critters.  I'll probably be planting chives and/or garlic among the roses at a later date toward the same end (fussy damn <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/2268.html"">hybrid teas</a> attract every bug in the neighborhood). I already planted lemon, cinnamon and sweet basil.  The sweet basil is beginning to peek up, as are the tomatoes.  I'm impatient to see everything sprout -- the basil, the peppers, the carrots.  For me, waiting is the hardest part of gardening.

To soothe my impatience, I've been looking at <font size=1>(more)</font> seed catalogs.  The side of the house with the garden gets the afternoon sun, and in the summer, it is going to heat up like a stove (and the inside of the house will be the kettle) unless I put some green on it.  But the landlady put that awful weed-prevention plastic fabric down, and then gravel over it, so the ground underneath is, well, awful.  That's why the vast majority of my garden is in pots.  And we're broke, so the pots are all cheap plastic from the dollar store.  But because we're broke, the electric bill during the summer isn't something I want to contemplate unless I shade that wall.  I'd like to grow something fragrant; like <a href=""http://www.thegardenhelper.com/Lathyrus.htm"">sweet peas</a> with four o' clocks in front of them (I'd have to move the pots a bit to accommodate it, but I could manage), but to get them to climb up the wall, I'll need enough <a href=""http://www.austinwholesaledecking.com/lattice/"">lattice trellis</a> for them to climb all across the wall.  They need good soil (which, due to the afore mentioned garden-fabric-and-gravel monstrosity is not readily available), but if I could scare up 3 or so 20-inch containers, I could grow them that way.  In fact, I'd love to, but for the problem of being broke -- and that leads to a vicious cycle (viz. the summer electric bill portion above).  So, short of getting lucky and finding someone giving lattice panels away on craigslist, I'm up a creek."

"event","Back when I was looking for <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/3208.html"">colored calla lilies to plant</a>, I went to the local Smith & Hawken store.  I was loosely familiar with their <a href=""http://www.smithandhawken.com/catalog/category.jsp?categoryId=cat40145"">web catalog</a>, and reasoned that, though they are somewhat elitist, that would make them more likely to carry exotic, unusual versions of things -- albeit at a markup.  But since I was only looking to buy two calla lily bulbs, I jaunted on down there, figuring that it was worth taking a look. Boy, was I ever wrong!

I got to the store (in a suitably upscale part of town), and proceeded to look for my calla lilies.  I couldn't find any!  In fact, the only <i>plants</i> I could at all find were a supply of amaryllis bulbs (artfully displayed next to <a href=""http://www.smithandhawken.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=prod275500&categoryId=cat240034p"">hand-blown specialty forcing vases</a>), a tub full of bamboo, and one purple phalaenopsis orchid on a stand next to the cash register.  The rest of the store was taken up with accessories for what I can only call ""the garden lifestyle"".  

The store was a welter of <a href=""http://www.smithandhawken.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=prod84464&categoryId=cat140050p"">wrought-iron garden edging</a>, <a href=""http://www.smithandhawken.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=prod400042p&categoryId=cat120251#section_desc"">topiary forms</a>, and <a href=""http://www.smithandhawken.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=prod22855&categoryId=cat170280"">solar-powered  grill lamps</a>.  Everything assumed that you already had a beautifully designed and maintained garden, and merely needed certain genteel accouterments in order to fully enjoy it.  No dirtying of the hands for the Smith & Hawken crowd! -- even the few plants they did stock didn't actually require soil or planting.  The most strenuous task that a purely Smith & Hawken gardener might contemplate would be the well-bred snipping of a few flowers with one's <a href=""http://www.smithandhawken.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=prod74503&categoryId=cat120313"">Swiss-made pruning shears</a> (formerly available only to horticulturalists, don't you know?). You could get reproduction Victorian terrariums, but no plants to live in them.  I don't know what Smith & Hawken stores are selling, but it certainly isn't <i>gardening</i>, so much as it is some kind of fantasy of garden life.

And frankly, I find this a bit creepy.  I don't entertain la-di-da fantasies of quasi-feudal sumptuality in my garden.  I grow plants.  I grow them because they smell nice, look attractive or taste good.  I grow them because there is no flavor like that of homegrown strawberries.  I grow them because I can't find lime basil at the supermarket for less than I would make by selling an internal organ.  I grow them because <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/3208.html"">the gravel bed I would otherwise be stuck with</a> is ugly and would reflect heat into the house.  I grow them because it makes me feel connected to my grandmothers, because the smell of moonflowers outside my window on a summer night is divine, and because the exertion of gardening feels clean and virtuous.  I may not throw parties there, but if you ask to see my garden, I'll gladly show you around (and if my garden gets out of hand, I may leave a bag of tomatoes on your front porch, ring the bell and run). Gardening requires dirt and sweat, but the rewards -- both tangible and intangible, are amazing.  I imagine that (at least for me) substituting the ""garden lifestyle"" for actual gardening wouldn't be much different in result from the elegant, languid, surreal ennui depicted in <a href=""http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/10/marienbad.html"">Last Year at Marienbad</a>.  There is a lack of reality that warps the psyche, but just enough reference to reality (or what seems like reality) so as to be both dissatisfying and disorienting.

I'm not saying that I'd never buy anything from Smith & Hawken (those wrought-iron trellises and Victorian terrariums did look awfully pretty), so much as I find the overriding theme of the place -- the symbol of what it stands for -- not only distasteful, but eerie in the extreme.

If you want a hand-turned <a href=""http://www.smithandhawken.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=prod23007&categoryId=cat240097p#section_desc"">lawn bowling game</a>, grilling planks for <a href=""http://www.smithandhawken.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=prod54500&categoryId=cat170280"">Infus(ing) salmon, chicken, vegetables, and other grilled foods with the smoky essence of cedar or maple</a>, or a fluted <a href=""http://www.smithandhawken.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=prod250064p&categoryId=cat170280"">copper beverage bucket</a>, then Smith & Hawken is the place for you.  Me?  I'd rather get my hands dirty in the garden."

Excerpt:
The spectacular bloom of a magnolia may be a very common sight in gardens but in the wild, it is a different story.

A new report has found that over half the world's magnolia species are facing extinction in their forest habitats....  Threats to their existence include the destruction of habitat to make way for agriculture, and over-exploitation.

************************************
The <a href=""http://www.bgci.org/conservation/magnolia_red_list/"">Red List of Magnoliaceae</a> was published on April 2 by <a href=""http://www.bgci.org/"">Botanic Gardens Conservation International</a> and <a href=""http://www.fauna-flora.org/"">Fauna and Flora International</a>. It identifies 131 wild magnolia species as being in danger of extinction, (mostly in Asia, Europe, the southern US, Central America and South America). There are 245 species of magnolia worldwide.

If you're like me, you read about this kind of thing with a feeling of helpless horror -- it is awful, certainly, but what can I do about it?  Well, conservation efforts such as those made famous in the United States are good examples of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-situ_conservation""><i>in situ</i> conservation</a>.  And these are amazingly valuable -- preserving, as they do, a species in its natural situation.  But <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex-situ_conservation""><i>ex situ</i> conservation</a> efforts are also important.  The best known of these are seed banks and the <a href=""http://cres.sandiegozoo.org/projects/gr_frozen_zoo.html"">San Diego Zoo's ""frozen zoo""</a>.  With plants, <a href=""http://www.bgci.org/conservation/botanic_conservation/"">botanical gardens</a> often function as <i>ex situ</i> <a href=""http://www.bgci.org/botanic_gardens/bgs_in_conservation/"">conservation centers</a>.  Now, people often think <a href=""http://www.nybg.org/"">big</a> when they think of botanical gardens, but really, the vast majority of botanical gardens in the world are <a href=""http://www.millergarden.org/index.htm"">small and local</a> -- but they are no less precious for that.  And while getting involved with a <a href=""http://www.botanic-garden.ox.ac.uk/"">famous</a> or <a href=""http://www.huntington.org/BotanicalDiv/HEHBotanicalHome.html"">prestigous</a> botanical garden may be both difficult and intimidating, <a href=""http://www.botanic.org/Volunteer_Program.asp"">becoming involved</a> with a <a href=""http://www.botanic.org/"">local botanical garden</a> is almost as easy as finding water while falling out of a boat.  And since magnolias are generally <a href=""http://www.usna.usda.gov/Gardens/faqs/magnoliafaq2.html"">easy to care for</a>, it seems to me that gardeners and botanical gardens in magnolia-friendly climates could do a lot worse than to plant and care for specimens of endangered magnolias.  For example, the <i>Magnolia portoricensis</i> is native to Puerto Rico, and the <a href=""http://montosogardens.com/"">Montoso Gardens</a> have <a href=""http://montosogardens.com/magnoliaceae.htm"">already begun to preserve it</a> in this way.  The <i>Magnolia macrophylla</i> subspecies <i>ashei</i> (aka <i>Magnolia ashei</i>) is noted in the Red List as being vulnerable -- it is a native of Florida, and it can actually be <a href=""http://www.pineridgegardens.com/2003Tree_2.htm"">bought as a seedling from the Pine Ridge Gardens Catalog</a>.  There isn't any reason why botanical gardens (and skilled home gardeners) in Florida couldn't begin to do the same.  It would take knowledge and skill, but there are knowledgeable, skilled gardeners who, by pooling their efforts and resources, could really make a difference to these trees.

We aren't helpless.  We can press for conservation efforts on a national and global scale, and we can get our hands dirty on a local scale, and through local organizations.  It may take both kinds of effort in order to make a difference, but we <i>can</i> do it."

"event","For lack of being able to afford real trellis, I faked one up, using 6ft stakes and fishing twine.  It'll do -- at least for the creeping fig to climb up, at any rate.  Among the creeping fig, I planted <a href=""http://www.hostapatch.com/pimages/Zagers_white_edge.jpg"">white edged hostas</a> and calla lilies in various colors (<a href=""http://www.peoriagardens.com/images/specialty/CallaLilyAmethyst.jpg"">Amethyst</a>, <a href=""http://www.peoriagardens.com/images/specialty/CallaLilyGolden.jpg"">Golden chalice</a>, <a href=""http://www.lakesidecallas.com/images/spring%20white%2007-06-04-s.jpg"">Classic white</a>, and <a href=""http://www.pacificcallas.com/Callafornia%20Callas%20Large%20Pictures/Pacific%20Callas%20Variety%20Pink%20Rehmannii.jpg"">Pink Rehmannii</a>).  I have them arranged with the pink on the ends, and then, moving toward the center, the white, yellow and purple.  
<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/garden7.jpg""></center>
I'm not sure how it'll turn out, but if I decide I don't like it, I won't be hard to dig up the plants and replant them in the fall.  The one I'm not sure about is the yellow -- all the other colors are sort of gentle and subtle, and I worry that the yellow will be out of place.  Oh well -- I guess I'll just wait and see.  I also put some solar powered lights along the path for safety -- that side yard gets very dark at night, and going to retrieve things from the dryer in the dark can be dangerous.

In other news, the <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/3208.html"">wildflowers in the gravel bed</a> seem to be sprouting.  So that's good.  Hopefully soon that bed will be more attractive than just an expanse of cheap crushed granite."

"event","So after all of my previous hemming and hawing, I have finally begun actually planting in the garden.  My plan has been modified (yet again) so that it will look like this:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/garden6.jpg"">

I planted the <a href=""http://davesgarden.com/pf/go/2029/"">creeping fig</a> on Sunday and I put some posts in along the ugly fence (with the help of my sweet hubby).  As soon as the ground the posts are sunk in dries a bit, I'm going to string fishing line between them to make a kind of cheap-o trellis (because a real trellis -- even the splintery redwood kind -- is just not in the budget in the quantities I'd need.  Getting a couple for the peppers and tomatoes is another story, though -- that shouldn't be a problem.) for the creeping fig to grow on -- and hopefully that'll cover up the hideous fence.

I'm up in the air about the star jasmine.  Maybe I'll put moonflower there instead.

I'm going to sprinkle the seeds of <a href=""http://davesgarden.com/pf/go/253/index.html"">viola</a>, <a href=""http://www.yardener.com/Impatiens.html"">impatiens</a>, <a href=""http://davesgarden.com/pf/go/186/"">bachelors' buttons</a> and <a href=""http://davesgarden.com/pf/go/230/index.html"">alyssum</a> in front of the creeping fig, so it isn't just bare, ugly gravel.  For the callas, I'm thinking perhaps a pale tinted type (as opposed to pure white or ivory) like the <a href=""http://www.pacificcallas.com/CallalilyPeachChiffonbulbs.htm"">peach chiffon</a> variety.  I definitely want to get a green and white variegated hosta like <a href=""http://hostapatch.com/pimages/antioch.jpg"">antioch</a> or <a href=""http://hostapatch.com/pimages/Independence.jpg"">independence</a>.

I'll be growing <a href=""http://www.victoryseeds.com/information/craig_brandywine.html"">brandywine tomatoes</a>, and <a href=""http://www.fiery-foods.com/dave/ancho.html"">ancho</a> and <a href=""http://www.parkseed.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?storeId=10101&catalogId=10101&langId=-1&mainPage=prod2working&ItemId=5270&PrevMainPage=advsearchresults&scChannel=Vegetables%20AS&SearchText=p16.v231;s1.Pepper&OfferCode=T1H"">anaheim</a> peppers.  I'll be growing lemon, cinnamon and regular basil as well, and a mix of sunflowers in the corner.

As for the bare, ugly gravel outside the gate, I'm seriously contemplating scattering some wildflower seeds and compost over it all, spraying it to wash the seeds and soil down between the rocks, and just see what grows up through it.  Maybe I'll put some rosemary up against the fence, by the gate.  Something has to be done about it -- that bed is ugly as sin, and during the summer, it'll just reflect the heat (which is no small matter down here in southern California)."

"event","Ok, I think I have the layout of the sunny side of the garden finalized.  Everywhere there is a yellow line in this image, I intend to put up a trellis of some kind so that the vine-y plants can grow on it.  The tomatoes and peppers need support, the ugly, ugly fence on the right needs to be covered, and I adore morning glories -- so I'm going to grow them in a way that they will be contained (and not eat the house), but that I can still enjoy them.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/garden5.jpg"">

One of the things that inspired this design was the idea of a 'salsa garden' -- the idea that by just walking out the door, my husband and I could harvest the fixings for homemade salsa.  The garden just doesn't have enough room to grow all the ingredients for salsa (say, the onions and garlic), so some of the ingredients will still have to be store bought.  But onions, for one, keep forever and are cheap, so I'm fairly happy with the modified salsa garden.  I'll have cilantro and  a few different kinds of basil (and rosemary in the front yard) and mexican oregano to give the vegetables some zing.  And of course there will be strawberries (I love strawberries).

But I have also worked in some purely pretty elements, too.  The sunflowers are big and bulky enough (since I'll be growing a couple different heights as well as shasta daisies) to act as a 'gatekeeper' into the back yard itself -- a function that will be improved if I can manage to plant a tree across the path from them.  There will be morning glories and one or two geraniums (scented geraniums, I hope!) near the gate.  And on the right side of the yard will be clematis and moonflower vining over that ugly, ugly fence to make it lovely instead.  I'm still looking at things to grow on the shady side -- it seems that most of the plants I have an affinity for are sun-dwellers, or that the spring is the wrong time of year to plant them.  I think that in the fall, I'll plant some iris there, but maybe I'll do some hostas and mint in the interim.  We'll see.

As you can tell, I'm using the existing gravel as a design element to separate beds.  I want the ""paths"" of rock to sort of flow -- to not be all straight lines and right angles, but to surround and protect the beds in a curving, organic sort of manner."

"event","I haven't spoken of our front yard in this journal yet.  That is largely because it is already established.  It is the usual front lawn with foundation plantings (rather uninteresting, IMHO, but not egregiously bad either.  The landlady planted some roses in the foundation plantings for her mother (who lives in a separate apartment added onto our house).  The landlady's mother loves the roses (and there is no way on earth I'm going to rip out those thorn monsters) so the roses are going to stay.  It occurs to me that the yard encapsulates two biases of mine about lawns and about roses.

I know there are some people who are <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/life/2002/2002-04-12-landscaping.htm"">vehemently anti-lawn</a>, and while I am sympathetic to and even agree with <a href=""http://www.foodnotlawns.com/lawns_to_gardens.html"">their points</a> (lawns <i>do</i> take a lot of water, which is a problem in dry environments, <a href=""http://www.nwf.org/backyard/cutlawn.cfm"">Americans use an insanely high level of synthetic fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides and petroleum-powered appliances in order to keep our lawn looking like a green carpet rather than actual grass</a>, not to mention the myriad problems of monoculture), my first issue with lawns is that I don't really understand why most people have them.  

I understand the desire for a lawn if one has kids, plays croquet on a regular basis or basically has an actual reason that having an encompassing soft herbaceous carpet is desirable (that being said, I think it is incumbent upon the croquet-players-with-children to choose a turf species that is suitable to their environment and doesn't require extreme measures to keep it healthy).  But it seems to me that most Americans who have lawns don't use them for anything.  Take front lawns -- they are almost entirely unused.  So why do people have them?  Because everyone else in their neighborhood has them.  People spend insane amounts of time, money and mental effort (not to mention <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/05/national/05LAWN.html?ex=1169528400&en=418956fac29ddb36&ei=5070"">water</a>, chemicals, and the <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/otaq/consumer/f98025a.pdf"">pollution of gasoline powered lawn equipment</a>) in order to be like everyone else.  Is it just me, or is this eerily reminiscent of the 8th grade?  You can wax choleric about <a href=""http://www.yougrowgirl.com/explore/panic.php"">postwar conformity</a> or the imitation of the <a href=""http://evolvethought.blogspot.com/2006/05/evolution-of-lawns.html"">English aristocracy's country estates</a> -- and you may very well be correct.  But the threshold question for me is ""why bother?""  And I really don't have a very good answer.  I'd rather have a yard full of wildflowers or tomatoes and melons than fussy grass that needs coaxing to look pretty, but sends its suckers all over creation -- including into my flower beds.  Talk about more trouble than its worth!

As for the roses -- well, I have a soft spot in my heart for roses, since my grandmother was a rose hybridizer who sold her creations to rose sellers such as <a href=""http://www.jacksonandperkins.com/"">Jackson & Perkins</a>.  The thing is, she always separated her roses -- those that were for work and those that were for love.  For a little while now, Americans have had a love affair with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Tea"">hybrid tea rose family</a>.  When you go to a nursery and buy a rose bush to plant in your yard, I'll bet dollars to doughnuts that the rose you buy is a hybrid tea.  In fact, odds are good that the nursery won't stock any roses <i>but</i> hybrid teas.  These, because of their popularity, were my grandmother's 'work roses'.  I, personally, am more than a bit mystified as to why they are so popular.  Many of them are scentless, and they can be darned fussy in the garden.  They like lots of water, but don't like to sit in wet soil -- they are the floral incarnation of the fussy aunt who just can't be made happy.  That (and this is just a personal bias), they often have aesthetically cacophonous names like ""<a href=""http://www.rose-roses.com/roseimages/hybridteas/HotPewter1.jpg"">Hot Pewter</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.growquest.com/Chrysler_Imperial_003.jpg"">Chrysler Imperial</a>"".  Those names seem like nasty tricks to play on unsuspecting flowers.  Moreover, hybrid teas are all just variations on a theme -- long stemmed and similarly shaped, basically color and the presence of fragrance are the only variables.  Some are bushier and some are climbers, of course, but the flowers themselves are the big-box stores of the floral world.

This is depressing to me because there is such a wonderful variety of rose families out there.  There are the beautifully scented <a href=""http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/engl/Rosa_dam.html"">Damask Roses</a>, the medieval favorite <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Rose"">Gallica Roses</a> (which are hardy and content to grow in a wide range of conditions), the ruffly, easy-going <a href=""http://www.ars.org/About_Roses/ogrs_centifolia.htm"">Centrifolia</a> (which has lovely mid-green foliage in addition to its lush blooms), and the drought-tolerant <a href=""http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/consumer/factsheets/annuals/portulaca_grandiflora.html"">Moss Roses</a>.  There are <a href=""http://www.gardenmob.com/blog1/2006/08/23/bourbon-rose-souvenir-de-la-malmaison/"">Bourbon roses</a> with swirly petals, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_chinensis"">China roses</a>, and the (non-hybrid) <a href=""http://www.rdrop.com/~paul/teas/index.html"">Tea roses</a> with their delicate scent and spiral petals.  There is a plethora of these so-called ""old roses"" out there -- the ones my grandmother grew for love of the scent and beauty of the plant.  With so many lovely, vibrant and hardy choices (leaving aside their histories, which can also be intensely interesting) out there, the extreme predominance of the mass-produced, fussy hybrid tea rose is utterly baffling to me.  

But the hybrid teas are what grow in front of the house, and so they are what I'll tend.  Our landlord's mother is a sweet lady, and she loves those roses -- and they have managed to survive in the face of <a href=""http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7427.html"">snails</a>, <a href=""http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/MG006"">leaf miners</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitefly"">whitefly</a> and a biblically-proportioned plague of <a href=""http://lakewhatcom.wsu.edu/gardenkit/UnWantedPests/Aphid.htm"">rose aphids</a> (uck!) -- so perhaps they aren't as fragile as the hybrid tea reputation would suggest.  So today I sprayed them with insecticidal soap, removed the pest-harboring mulch, and mixed in some bone meal.  Soon, I'll apply <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neem_oil#Uses"">neem oil</a>, and  <a href=""http://www.seedsofchange.com/enewsletter/issue_55/companion_planting.asp"">interplant</a> some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_carrot"">Queen Anne's Lace</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentha_%C3%97_piperita"">peppermint</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennyroyal"">pennyroyal</a> (to discourage future infestations), and re-mulch it.  But if I had a magic wand, I'd sure turn those hybrid teas into damasks, bourbons, gallicas or real tea roses."

"event","Well, the landlady turned her coat.  Her <a href=""http://garden-enclosed.livejournal.com/530.html"">""I'll recoup you"" policy</a> turned into a subtly self-righteous attitude of ""I'm not going to subsidize <i>your</i> hobby"".  I would have been totally fine with her if she had never brought it up, but going back on her word really gets my goat!  She even had the nerve to say that she thought that providing me with <i>her</i> bed of roses to tend (a misplaced, badly planned bed of snail-chewed, mildew infested roses, of a variety that I find insipid and annoying) would be enough to satisfy me.  

And it looks as though going out and buying bedding plants is simply not in the budget.  For a little while, I was quite bummed out, because I thought that we just couldn't afford to have a garden.  However, I have been looking at seed and <a href=""http://toptropicals.com/people/seeds/htm/peat.htm"">peat pellet</a> prices (under $2 for an envelope of seeds, and under $5 for a package of 25 peat pellets), and it may yet be possible (I'll have to check and be sure, since blowing the budget would really suck, but I think a $25 initial budget could be wangled).  It'll take more time for the plants to get lush and lovely, but for heaven's sake it is <i>January</i> -- starting plants from seed at this point is hardly late.  In fact, it'll probably be a month or so before I start wanting to start seeds, anyway.

However, this means that the plans I have made so far are pretty well shot (I'm sure that one can grow jasmine from seed, but I have never heard of it done -- and I have had no luck with growing it from cuttings).  The herbs and tomatoes can stay, and I can get geranium cuttings from my grandmother (and by snitching as the neighbors trim theirs).  Lemongrass can be obtained from the supermarket and grown from a cutting that way.  But my vague plans for succulents around the sago palm and the jasmine and shade-happy plants I had identified are pretty well out of the question (unless I can swipe or buy cheaply <a href={http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedum"">Sedum</a> and/or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echeveria"">Echeveria</a> plants -- I wonder if I could get them to grow from cuttings.  They say it is possible, but I have never done it, and my 'grow from cutting' skills are rather hit-or-miss).  *sigh*  Well, I guess it is back to the drawing board to see what I can grow from seed that likes the shade (or partial shade)."

"event","OK -- I have contacted my landlady, and she has agreed to recoup me any funds (under a certain amount) that I spend this month on the garden.  I need to get some insecticidal soap to kill the aphids on the roses in the front, but aside from that, I can put that money toward the garden i the side yard.  Here is the layout as I have envisioned it so far:

<a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/gardenlayout1.jpg""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/gardenlayout1SM.jpg""></a>

As you can see, I have the lemongrass and the jasmine (though I'm still contemplating morning glories there instead) in the same place as before.  All I have added is two trellises with tomato plants and a section for an herb garden (cinnamon basil -- yummy!).  I'm thinking of putting in some succulents around the sago palm, and some geraniums (maybe even scented geraniums) toward the gate.  So I have a rough draft of the sunny side.  Now, I'm moving on to the shady side.

I'm thinking of planting Mexican Oregano (<a href=""http://www.californiagardens.com/Plant_Pages/poliomintha_longifolia.htm"">Poliomintha longifolia</a>), Bush Violet (<a href=""http://www.californiagardens.com/Plant_Pages/barleria_obtusa.htm"">Barleria obtusa</a>) and Christmas Ferns (<a href=""http://davesgarden.com/pf/go/384/index.html"">Polystichum acrostichoides</a>), and perhaps some Plantain Lily (<a href=""http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/1000/1239.html"">hostas</a>) and Busy Lizzie (<a href=""http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/plant.asp?code=A586"">Impatiens walleriana</a>) as well.  I'm worried that maybe the Plantain Lily will want too much water --  I don't want to have one of those gardens that is utterly unsuited to the place it is in.  San Diego is a fairly dry place, and while I don't want to go utterly desert-like, I would like to remain in keeping with a mild to low water use policy, at least for the decorative plants; herbs and vegetables are a bit different.  Because I can eat what they produce, it doesn't seem so frivolous to give them more water.  Of course I don't want to plant extreme water-guzzlers there, either -- they just get a bit more wiggle room in terms of water consumption.

The design question that has me fretting is this:  what to plant at the end of the path, where the side yard turns toward the main part of the back yard (where the purple squares are)?  I want to put something there that signifies some kind of transition to a different place, but I don't want to put up a gate or a privet hedge or do anything that actually cuts off space.  I guess I want a gate keeper without the gate.  It can be on one or both sides of the path, though if it is going to be on only one side, it had probably the side across from the wall of the house. I'm thinking that maybe a citrus tree or an avocado tree in a pot might make a good transition.  After all, this is turning out to be a very Southern California-style garden, and putting in one of those trees (especially in a <a href=""http://bluepoppygarden.com/images/cat/OrangePot1189002580.jpg"">terra cotta orange pot</a>) is a very Southern California type of touch.  Since citrus is more shade and cold tolerant than avocado, I'm leaning a bit toward that option, but oh, wouldn't hubby dear just love to be able to just walk out the door and gather tomatoes and avocados for his burrito fixings?  Maybe avocado would be the happier choice.  I'll have to give it some thought."

"event","One of the books I have been reading suggests that it is particularly important to create a sense of movement and discovery in a small garden -- that is, that a garden (especially if space is limited), will be somewhat boring if you can take it all in at one glance.  Given the constraints of my space -- a long alley with a path down the middle -- creating that sense of movement and discovery is going to be one of my particular challenges.  But I think I have hit upon a potential solution (or a part of one, anyway).  I'm thinking that I may be able to take advantage of the fact that the path has a slight curve to it by planting a clump of ornamental grass along the rise of the curve (somewhere in the green spot in the graphic below).  The grass will overhang the path just slightly, and be tall enough (4-5 ft or so tall) to obscure the direction the path takes.  I'm thinking of <a href=""http://davesgarden.com/pf/go/283/"">Lemongrass (<i>Cymbopogon citratus</i>)</a>. On a more feathery note, there is always <a href=""http://www.desert-tropicals.com/Plants/Poaceae/Muhlenbergia_dumosa.html"">Bamboo Muhly (<i>Muhlenbergia dumosa</i>)</a>.

I'll have to give it some thought, but I am tending toward the lemongrass, just because I love the idea of making a scented garden, and I was thinking of planting some herbs on the sunny side of the garden, anyway.  The lemongrass would fit right in!

"event","My husband and I just moved into a little house with a yard, which gives me the ability to really indulge my desire to garden.

I had a little balcony garden in our last apartment -- but between being unfamiliar with the climate in that city (and the plants that would do well in that hot, muggy environment), and the postage stamp-sized space, I never really felt like my itch to garden was really scratched.

Of course, every space comes with its own challenges, and my new yard is no exception.  My current canvas is the side yard -- a long, narrow space with one side that gets a lot of sun, another side that gets a lot of shade, and a side fence that is so darned ugly, that my first order of business is going to be figuring out something that will hide it.  These images are scale renderings of the yard, with the shadows set for 1pm in late December. The arc by the gate shows where the gate sweeps when it opens.

<center><b>Looking toward the fence</b></center>
<a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/garden1lg.jpg""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/garden1.jpg""></a><p>

<center><b>With dimensions labeled</b></center>
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/sweet_byrd/garden/garden2.jpg""><p>


Another challenge that the space presents is that grey rectangle that is next to the path and gate -- that is where the garbage and recycling bins live (and must continue to live).  So in addition to screening the ugly fence, I need to screen the garbage cans.  Right now, I'm tentatively thinking about growing morning glories or jasmine vines over the lot of them 

That black blotch near the third window isn't the chalk outline of a giant starfish -- it is a Sago palm, and, at least at this point, needs to be worked into my garden plans (whatever they end up being).  But considering the fence, the garbage and the extremes of sun and shade, the Sago palm is the least of my worries."

<i>""Opposition MP Chiam See Tong suggested NS for female citizens for one year from age 18, with basic military training for three months and nursing training for the remaining months.

 He believes the training will help women cope with life better and they can fill the vacancies in the hospitals if they do switch to full-time nursing.

 But it was his next statement which drew some smiles from the audience.

 'It's also a way for them to embrace motherhood and be a good housewife... Our girls will not object to one year.

 <b>'They get to mix with guys and are in better positions to find boyfriends and husbands,' he joked</b>, to some wry smiles from the audience at yesterday's budget debate.""</i>

The recent gems thrown out in Parliament (including the 'childbirth as national responsibility' bit) make me so fucking embarrassed to be Singaporean.

IMHO, compulsory national service has produced many operationally-ready lean mean fighting machines, but also just as many half-fuck foot soldiers. (My take on the situation from living with an air force <i>encik</i>, and after having had to sit through way too many NS-related conversations - for 2.5 years of every poor Singapore bloke's life, that's the main gist of what they talk about. If you think I'm wrong, feel free to give me your take.)

With that in mind, must we really spend millions of taxpayer dollars to train legions of bobo nurses too? It's a <b>vocation</b> for crying aloud, how many patients do they want to kill under the 'care' of half-fuck nurses with ONE YEAR worth of training?!

In the unlikely event that this should come to pass, I hope Mr Chiam See Tong's future nursing home is staffed with plenty of female NS trainees. (Hur hur.)"

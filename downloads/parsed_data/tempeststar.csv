I'm afraid my inability to control the way i feel is going to hurt my relationship with my own baby. I am not ready for this i had things i wanted to do before i had a kid and i didn't get any of it done. I'm afraid i won't be able to control that resentment. The worst part of it is he's coming at thhis for a whole diffrent place. he's had a good part of his life to do the things he wanted. In that respect i think he is more ready then i can ever be at this time. And i think i resent him some for that as well but also regret the loss of our just being a couple for awhile before being saddled with a child. I will be burdened from now on with someone i have to take care of and i haven't even finished myself yet.

I make all the money and don't have a penny for me after all the bills are done. I don't even have any money for food or gas really but neither of those are luxuries. I bought this stupid place trying to make the best move i could for us but maybe it was a mistake. I would have alot more free money if we had just rent some 2 bedroom pos. This is so aggrivating cause i make a lot of money if things had gone as i wanted i would have saved all this year and would have had alot put away before buying a place and then settle in for kids but it didn't and i am not sure how i can keep it all together. The majority of my maternity leave is only half pay and we can't pay all the bills when i get full pay. His dinky job only make enough to cover his bills. I am just drowning and there is no way out. The only thing i have left is anger and fear and resentment. None of theses things did i ever want towards my own child. When people say congradulations aboutbeing pregnant i just want to cry and faking happiness is just making me sick.

I just want to scream. And talking to him is like talking to a brick. He says he wants to talk but i say stuff and he says nothing in return or things that are completely useless. It's so damn aggrivating! He says he tries but saying half hearted it'll get better is NOT trying nor is it helping. It is lible to get him assualted."

We are having a girl... or so the the person tells me. I wouldn't be able to tell for those crazy ultrasound pics.

It's sunday now and i have moved all i own to my new house. I think i will be unpacking for days. My parents came to help out. My mom is the best at unpacking and organizing. I am so glad she came or i would still have more boxes then i do have kicking around. She also bought us our very own washer and dryer which gets deliver on thursday. YAY non more laundry mat!

Sad thing is I only slept for a few hours last night. It's so damn quiet out here compared to the busy street in lowell where i used to live. I am not complaining. It'll just take some time to get used to not hearing the neighbor's music, the car at the stop light and the endless stream of emergency viechles."

Everything is moving so fast and i feel i have no contorl not even over my own body. I think i want to eat somehting a few bites in i have to stop. Tommorow i am going house hunting as i got my pre-approval form the mortgage company this week. Rather own then rent any fucking more. The chanllenge finding what i need/want in the time frame i need to. It's a lot added with the not feeling myself, it's a little overwhelming. Alot people ask me if i am going to take my lip piercings out. I have said no thus far but they say i will once the baby gets a hold of them. That would be a real fun emergency room trip beacuase my baby ripped my lip open by pulling out my piercing. I already had to take out my belly piercing. With loosing so much of myself, am i prepared to sacrifice this bit more? You know i thought i would be more ready for this. GReanted it was not planed but i get the feeling even if it was it would still be overwhelming, add buying a place (if i can find one) and it's stress city as well as my jab being the first and only female in my division in this department. Thankfully i have a week's vacation after friday happens. I was supposed to go to florida but i will just proboly be bored out of my mind but it's a week away form work and few things are that precious."

I gave more blood then i ever have before and i loathe the evil needles. Sadly i am going to have to take out my belly ring, i love that piercing.  I still sometimes can not believe i am going to be a mom. I wanted to be but i had planed on a year or so form now. There are lots of things to do and little time to do them.

I started the new job in my company and got my first pay check which i must say is pretty damn sweet! My wolf and are are very happy and doing very well. I met his whole family and his sister and her girlfriend just love me. I have them caling me to come hang out wiht them. It's nice to feel so completely wanted by them. They seem more like a family then the one i knew and it's easy to relax around them. All of them are away this week due to work and i already miss them and him. The winter is going to be rough one but if we can stand it, i think it will all just work out. I am looking foreward to our trip to florida trip in october. It's going to be a lot of work but fun too. I am working the nascar with them in july which will be intresting I am sure. The winter when they will be gone the whole time concerns me some but it's still a ways off and i am trying not to worry too much ahead of time. Goddess knows i will be on  a plan south any weekend i can afford to go, granted work doesn't fuck me with a weekend shift. WE have a lot of plans and i hope we can pull some of them off.

"event","So it was definetly fun and amusing. Never got to dance around a fire at any other event i have been to. Although larper is a larper is a larper. It's funny no matter what the game, the style of people doesn't change. There was it's intrinsic drama but since i realy knew no one and nothing about anyhitng so it left me be. Sadly the drama i did see makes me trepidous about continuing. I hate drama! I am so tired of it and go to great lengths to avoid it when it involves myself. 

I really did have a fun dancing and hanging out, which was most of what i did. I got drunk, I danced, I smoked, I slept, I hung out. Quite honestly i would proboly have been pretty bored if it wasn't for the people i came with and the fire dancing. I was really sad to come back to reality on a whole. The wolf and I had a really good time. Some intresting conversations and alot of time with one another. Hopefully i am not the only one to think so. It would be so nice if life were as simple as that. 

As the real world crashes back, so does the concerns and the stupidity of all this shit. There are a few things that i am concerned with but i can only wait to see what shall come of that. Work sucked ass today. I am still waitiing to hear on the tech job that i could throw a rock form here to hit.I am still very tired from the weekend but tiredness seems to be a constant stat i can't shake.

I watched this really sappy movie earlier and there was this song in it and the refrain just caught me. I looked up the lyrics and really like the whole song, so here it is:

Can I ask you a question please
Promise you won't laugh at me
Honestly I'm standing here
Afraid I'll be betrayed.
As twisted as it seems, I only fear love when it's in my dreams
So let the morning light come in and let the darkness fade away
Chorus:
Can you turn my black roses red?
Can you turn my black roses red?

Drowning in my loneliness
How long must I hold my breath
So much emptiness inside I could fill the deepest sea
I reach to the sky as the moon looks on
One last year has come and gonne
It's time to let your love rain down on me

Can you turn my black roses red? (x3)
Cuz 
I'm feelin like I'll blame it on love (x6)

Can you turn my black roses red? (x3)
Cuz I'm feelin like I'll blame in on love
I'm feeling like I'll blame it on love"

Life is... diffrent, intresting, very busy.

I don't know what to think so i try not to, about anyhting. I have a ton to do to be ready for creathorn. A much awaited weekend of debautchery, fun and gaming. I think i ahve almost everyhting i need bought. I still ahve alot to be ready and all i ahve left is tommorow night. Then wednesday is fight practice wiht new purddy arrows a sexy man is making for me. Then thursday in early out then off for the extra long weekend. I am still trepidous about returning to larping but so many people i know will be there plus if i don't have fun there is always the night time activities to amuse me. Creathorn should be good. How good? Remains to be seen.

I guess my earlier rant was foolish because a few days after she came home they broke up for their own reasons. Funnier yet he got my lj and read said post and we talked about it today while we were outside of walmart. I said ""well you were driving me insane"" and this old lady laughs. She said ""i am not laughing at you just guy girl stuff."" She was right tho, it is sorta funny and he was driving me insane that day. He and i have been spending alot of good time together. I enjoy his company and things are good. He needs someone to listen and i ahve someone to counsel. For the first time in a long time i feel less than useless and there are a few other perks. *wink* Yes i have my fears and worries. Would i be me without them? But truth be told they are not really bothering me. I am having fun and as long as that remains the case, why worry!

"event","I always seem to get myself in the most intresting of places. I am not sure yet if it is a bad one or a good one. Time will tell on that account but what i do know is that it has been fun. That may change tommorow or not at all. We're back to the issue of time. I hate having to wait on other people to know if my life will go kiltering off or remain in the state of which i like it at the moment.

The more we talk, the more we speak, I feel as if the good times are over and it's time to wake up. I have no one to blame but myself for getting into this but I had ever so much fun. It's my up and down nature pulling me apart. I wish to remain positive but doubt has me in a strangle hold. Fear is my dibilitator and she has already raised her head. Last week i began wiht such a great mood and this week i begin with a sinking feeling.

One can hope for the better but the worst is what we usally get. 

Is it wrong to want to feel like you matter? I mean honestly i knew i was the other woman before we started but it was in motion long before i knew that. Her coming home brings it into stark reality. It was easy to pretend when she was away. I am not sure when it became a certainty between us but it just felt right. We barely talked only a few shouted conversations in a noisy club but my body knew before you ever touched it that i would let you. I think it was that long drive and that nice talk but going in to that day my body knew, my mind was slow to catch on.

This is harder for me then you but I am strong. 

It is easier to deal wiht things when you have people to tlak them out with. However anyone should know if i am resorting to this loathed site, that there is no one. I have precious few tot lak to and this sadens me most of all. Not like they could have prevented what i did or will do but it's nice to have someone to talk to about it. 

Blah this came out all doom and gloom, when i am aprehensive but not overly upset, yet. I guess i just had to get the negative out so i didn't keep it in and worry away at it all day. Fuck that you know me, i'll worry at it all day either way. I need to relax about some things more often.

Look Some morbid poetry! We haven't seen that in awhile from me. Some music i was listening to caught my imagination.

I sacrifice myself with every waking breath and all i recieve are ashes. 
Their taste so bitter and hard to swallow.
Do you see the blood on my face, does it even matter?
The tears I shed for you will be witnessed by none.
Take away the vesiage of strength is to rip a person asunder.
Peel away the walls and their is nothing left to hide.
Sense of self is all we have, to barter with whom we choose.
I'll paint myself a shade of grey and fade into the shadow.
To seek a place to ease the discomfort and wile away the hurt."

"event","My resolution this year is to go back to school. I know i need to and i am just wasting time not taking the time to do that. I have my doubts but i need to do this. I am afraid as my job is stressful i am not sure i will be able to handle the added stress of courses. It's not like i can quit and go back to school full time. I have things i have to pay. My mother told me I should take an online course and prove i am commited to this. If i do well she will help me pay for some course, which would be a big help. I have never taken an online course before but it seems the most flexible way to work around my life. However the way my schedule is i would have the time to take a morning class or 2 once at a college once my new schedule starts, although the schedule is not set in stone they can change them if they do not work they way the company needs hours.

Here is my issue: 
I was looking online for classes but find not may offer the degree i want online. UML i was looking at as i live in town and could maybe take real courses later offers BA of liberal arts with a psychology concentration. Not exactly what i want, also will take a very long time. Actually taking real classes would be optimal but my track record with that was abysmal when i had the chance. http://continuinged.uml.edu

However there is another more specialized school which only does online classes, that has a major that really intrests me. It is Clayton college for natural health. The offer degrees in natural health and all kinds thing wiht classes that all intrest me. I had given thought to take some courses there once i got a BA in psychology but online it will take much much longer then i would like. http://www.ccnh.edu

I guess my delema is I am really intrested in both psychology and the nartural health. Do i take more specialized classes that all seem intresting? Or do i try courses at Umass that has requirements with things i hate? I am not sure how good a job i could get with either and both colleges do offer help to find work. 


So for those of my friend who do still take the time to pop by and see if i bother to write in months your thoughts on this would be most welcome."

Transport Provided to Anywhere - Room Desperately Needed! (For the Animal Victims of Katrina) 
There is transportation provided, with people ready and waiting, for upwards of 200 dogs and 150 cats so far rescued from the devastation of hurricane Katrina. What these animals need is a place to go. Kennels, boarding, vets offices, shelters with any extra space, foster homes and rescues. Even one or two open kennels would greatly help. 

From what we know, all animals have been vaccinated and are in good health considering the conditions. There are dogs and cats of every breed and size. Some are in groups of two, three or four, hailing from the same family, while some are solitary. ANY KENNEL SPACE AVAILABLE CAN CERTAINLY BE USED. These drivers are willing to move these animals ANYWHERE they need to go. Absolutely anywhere. 

The current safe houses for these animals are being inundated and some of these pets will have to be euthanized if they are not moved to make room for the incoming animals. 

Please feel free to pass on this information everywhere. Every forum, every list, every community. 

REMEMBER THESE ANIMALS WILL BE TRANSPORTED TO YOU. 

If you know anyone, anywhere, that is willing to take in even one cat or dog, please have them contact Lynda at the information provided below. 

They are also asking for ANY kind of donations for the animals - money, food, bedding, water, etc.

I worked, what joy then went to the fing RMV (cuz they suck). Then had some food and drinks wiht friends. I got a few b-day calls from the friends who remembered. All and all it was decent day which i can't turn my nose up at since my b-day tend to suck. I am throwing the after party for the club i go to tommorw night. Figured it was easier then having a big party tonight. Not to mention my roomate fucked me on rent so i could not afford the expense. Hopefully a few people will come chill tommorow. I get to get up to get my state inspection tommorow.

Honestly as shocked as i am to admit i ahve a fairly positive mood going. Normally i get the b-day depression. I think it may have soemthign to do wiht what i could call my b-day present i got early. It is oh so nice to have someone to hurt. I could not ask for a funner toy. *EG* I am letting things flow for now and seeing what turns up but i am content wiht myself for once. Yeah my life is nto how i want it and i am alone but who knows what'll happen.

Alright my quasi optimism is scaring me. I am just not horribly depressed at the moment but in writing here makes it seem more happy then it is. I am just going with the flow cuz nothing i can do right now will change it all that much.

I think that is all i have right. Going to toss on some happy bunny underpants (a b-day gift which rocks) then curl up in my bed."

I am not sure why i keep playing this game. The fun went out of it a long time ago. I am constanly alone and more often miserable, there seems to be no relief in sight. For all things appear to have changed for me, all go on wiht their turns but i remain. Everything is shifting around me but i seem to be stuck on the same square. I am tired of hurting, of wondering and of hoping. The dice never seem to fall right for me. I am tired of beign at the mercy of other people. I hate how some people can make me feel worse about myself with out trying, how they can make me seem like a whining child just wanting a moments time. I have no depedable person to share my burdens with, or likealbe soul to eliviate some fustrstion with. This appears to be my lot in the world to be miserable and often lonely even in company of people. So I will bare what i must and rage when i can but mostly take it in and suffer in silence because it's all i can seem to do anymore. I can not seem to change it no matter how hard i try, so let it consume me and be done with it."

Ever notice how no one ever uses the names of actual people, just nicknames or vauge references. well, unless they truly hate the person and then you see them plastering their info to the world but not always. LJ is truly amusing and yet utterly ingenious.

i find it funny how a few bad words, a less then perfect conversation, a lack luster day or just plain feeling lousy will tear apart months of foreward progress. It can strip all that time of good feeling and happy days and make them meaningless. I guess it's true you know you are alive cuz it hurts. You think you have changed you go through so much and yet some simple things makes the pyramid collapse. Then you realize the reason is you built it upside down. Why is it we always build ourself up first with the the things that will turn to dust under the weight of more substancial substance? Why do we start at the top and build up thinking this time maybe it won't topple? why is the road we know we should be on so clearly seen but we can never find it?

Life i suppose is full of theses amusing surprises i suppose. So many people don't know how to help themselves without hurting or putting others below themselves. Gotta be the me first give me give me attitude we have got here. No one seems to matter but ourselves. When you give others take but they never stop to help fill you up. They never seem to undestand that plight of the soul weary. 

Soul weary... no there is a phrase and a concept to ponder. I have voiced enough existential thought for today, so let us stop here and ponder that."

"event","Well i gladly had a chance to have the conversation i had been wanting to have over the weekend. The answer is what i expected and completely understandable, just not what i had hoped for. Oh well, things will continue as they are and I am fine wiht it. All and all tho my weekend was good, spent time a with my friends and generally had a good tome doing nothing in particular. I didn't really want to come home tonight but promised mom i would be here when she gets out of work. I have had work off since fri and will not work again till wens, it kinda seems like a mini vaca or somehting. it was nice to chill and not go home, i haven't done that since i came back and I guess I forgot what it was like to not have a parent around. The only down side is lack of shower gear that is yours, as you always like you shower, shampoo and soap stuff best. Heh, that's the virgo in me talking. Like i said tho all things totaled i had a good weekend and enjoyed the timw ith my friends.

I dunno i am in a good mood and i hope the feeling lasts the week but the chances are slim. However right now i am going to get some sleep in my bed with my kitty, unless he attacks me which is more likely."

"event","it's 4 am and i ahve been trying to sleep for hours without sucess and i ahve a migrane, my whole body aches and i am just generally spiteful. so in my desperation i turn to my lj as there are thing i have beeen meaning to write in here and apprently i have all the time in the world.

The reason i say shocking but my mentality of late and the things that have come out of my mouth would shock those who know me and fill my best firned's mouth wiht words of praise. So shocking in a good way my dear firends not in the scandelous way i am sure you all think of me in. This occured form me when i was reiterating my disintrest to someone who wanted to persue me. so, let me preface this story wiht how i am feeling lately. I am very lonely, i miss having some one to be with. I am tired of the games people play and i am fustrated about meeting people but don't really want to meet anymore. I want somehting i can not fully explain, i want a grown-up relationship. i want someone who has his own life and i have mine. enough i ramble those who have tlkaed to me lately have heard all this. I just want something to put it in it's simplest terms.

So to the story, i told this person as well as another few in the last month. there is ONE person i am intrested in persueing and i do not want to be distrated by you or anyhting else. It's totally crazy i know. I don;t even think i have a snowball chance wiht this person, but i don't want anything else to get in the way. For the first time in my life i have one pospect on my plate and i am fine wiht that. i really wish i knew where i stood with him, i plan to sit down and talk wiht him and say things i need to asap. I know he has a complicated life and i would just be ok being a small part in it. I am nto looking for anyhting major wiht him, just something. I know i may be setting myself up for major failure but i am tired of fucking around, in as many ways you can mean that. I dunno he makes me nervous and happy and scared and special if he just pays attention to me. it has been a really long time since i have been a scared about a person. normally i know who they are, where they go, their firneds, what to expect and i don;t, i really don't. Yes i have known this person for a while not well just as someone i say hi to when i see them but i don't know. I wouldn't say the l word at all, it's just something i cna't put my finger on, could be big time lust for all i know but the point is i ahve turned down every person, every oppertunity that has come my way since i have come back. It's totally crazy and by goddess i know it, exspecially with what i know is going on with him and i am in for fall but for once i am not scared of being scared.

i had another convo wiht a diffrent firned tonight, hope he doesn't mind me quoting. He said he liked himself and i said no you don't because you harm yourself, you can't like yourself if you do that. to this he replied well my reson for change is gone and i said yo have to do it for yourself. It's so very true, i am tried of being the person people say i am. i am just plain tired of that life. I am tired of sleeping wiht guys who won't even consider having a relationship wiht me. I tired of that fucked up game. I know it seems like i am doing that for this guy but i'm most certainly not. I know there are other girls he sleeps wiht and like i said maybe it's a pipe dream but i making this change for me. I am cutting out the distrations, i said no to them before they even started because I do not want to be sidetracked form what i am after. If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. i will be depressed for awhile ofcourse and then i will go out there and try to meet someone new. however it's obvious i will have to go outside my ususal circles to do so.

I don't know i think i may be completely nuts putting all my eggs in one basket. i as much as anyone know how bad this could all turn out but what if it doesn't? would you listen to me! i sound so fucked. i wish i were on somehting right now it may explain all this. I dunno maybe my time away gave me perspctive, maybe the incident a few months back really ripped something apart in my head. i don;t know maybe it's being back here or the hell i ahve been going through the last few weeks. yes i want to be touched, i want to loose myslef but not as much as i need to strong for once, to not give in cuz it's expected. I fear my years of weakness will make it too easy to fail in what i set before myself or rejection will cause me to give up or maybe i am just blustering here.

so here is what i say to make myself feel better: i have hope that things go well, i have experience that tells me they will not, i have knoweledge of the situation, i have the ablilty to take protect myself and i have open eyes to see the reality before me. This might be my craziest entry yet or quite possibly the sanest. i am not sure if it's the rampant pain in my body the late hour or somehting else but time will tell on this one. so back into the breach once more friends and let it end wiht hope because wiht out it all is lost unto the waves of never ending fears.

""I asked myself 'was I content,'
with the world that I once cherished?
did it bring me to this darkened place
to comtemplate my perfect future
I will not stand nor utter words against 
this tide of hate
losing site of what and who I was again"""

"event","i have been meaning to for so long write an entry here that i no longer know what to say anymore. it's rather silly but i'm all nervous and indecisive what to put down here in words. so many things have happened, some good some bad but all and all life is it's abismal self. actually it could be a smige worse then normal. I had a good evening but now i am home and feeling... well i dunno how i am feeling, kinda down but i ahve been this way most of the week. I have quite a few things on my mind. One of them is very fustrating as i need some advice and i know no one capable of giving me good impartial advice. it's such a silly delema really but i dunno i just need help, like a girl's advice or a good guy's point of view on the matter. *sigh* it all comes down to trust and i have few friends worthy of that designation. it's not some of their fault as some of my newer friends i do not know well enough to share somethings with but it make me feel bad.

I wish i could drag myself out of this slump i am in. things just seem to be pouring down on me and they shouldn't be. I should be in a better mood. I have a job, for now even if it blows. it's money, right? that is what i keep trying to tell myself. obviously that tactic is not working very well. I want to buy myself something i ahve been wanting but everything i really want is expensive. I was kinda hoping i would have had the money for a good digital cam to take pics at the festival.

I have been reading this amazing book Dean Koontz: The Taking. If ya liek horror read it, in fact read any of his books i have not read on yet i do not like. I am looking foreward to getting to the end of this current one. In fact i am amazed i have not completed it sooner as it is very hard to put down. I have much more to say and yet nothing at all. so i shall leave you wiht this T.S. Elliot quote that Koontz uses alot in the book the taking.

8 Days left of work and 14 more days here

But why is it when things get so bad we rutrn to the old things? 
Like my LJ, i know i should write in it more faithfully to keep myself in check with myself but my complaint form earlier still stands. The whole people i do not want reading my LJ do but i lothe to do private entries.

But confussed does not cover it for me, everyhting is so complicated and stress abounds... with the whole moving, job quiting, trying find a new job and not suceeding, guys, friends, gaming and the constant driving back and forth. Also, all the internal personal shit connectinged with all that stuff and the stress and change.

I am a mess. I am afraid all the good progress i made up here will be lost by my returning into a horrid situation i went running form over a year and a half ago. *sigh* Can not believe i am going to go live at my rent's for as little time as possible, no more then 3 month I hope. On the up side i have a fiend i can stay with during august for a bit.

I guess we shall see what happens cuz that is all i can do."

"event","Almost a month into the new year and i haven't written a word... not even an end year sum up or a new year hopeful. I think maybe because i lack the way to describe how i feel and my life is uber boring. I hate to endlessly bitch but do when i must but how do you really describe those intense feelings you barely comprhend, they just seem to be. Then again i change my mind so often soemtimes i loose track of me. Also, truth be told there are a few people how have this link that i am then pleased about and i feel vulnerable to bear all that's goign on because unwanted reapetion of my personal bitch session is a risk. Ironically, every time i think to wirte i come up empty and a few time when i didn't i was unwilling due to above said reason. I have alot of balls in the air and maybe i feel if i keep it all to myslef i can keep the momentum up but it's kicking my ass trying to be miss socialite all weekend cuz i work all week. Having 2 days to pack in all the fun for the rest of the week is not fun. I have booked myself up wiht games and barely have time to relax or date this new very cool guy i met.

*sigh* I have made on decisiion tho for this new year. I want my socail life back!!! I have started applying to jobs and will move asap or if i must wait till my lease is up. I want to move now but i can only justify it if i have a job to go straight into. I am dead set in this decision, I will even be willing to return to my parent's house temporarily and for those of you who know me that is a big deal. It just goes to show how deperate I am. I mean is it wrong to want to go out once in awhile??? I don't think so and i want to be closer to my friends. I want to be able to hang out and not do anyhting. I want people who will actually be able to visit me and not drive about an hour to have to do so. 

If i could move right now, I would be happier but we will see what happens next. Things really suck right now but they could be getting better. I won't say I am hopefully but i am not sure what i am. Things are up in the air and maybe they will land me in a better situation but it will definately change by august."

She was very ill, even still it was very sad. I dodn't think that sadness has let me. Nothing else bad has happened but that cloud of doom seems all too close still. I have alot of things on my min and plate and i don't know what to do with any of it. I don't want to tlka to anyone anout it but had a bit spill out when i was tlkaing earlier and am annoyed wiht it because i can not fully discuss every aspect of my life with any one person. The onl;y person i can tlka the most free wiht, i really don;t want to tlka to about this and keep biting his head off every tiem i try and i'm constantly calling back to apologise for being nasty. Life is hard for me right now and i eternally feel the panic rise in the back of my mind. I am truly isolated up here and the longer the stay the more i pull away because everyone carries on. I am faced wiht the fact that certain individuals are moving and soem of that is hard. Althoguh how shoudl i expect things to be when i annouce one weekend i am moving and do it the next day. It's becoming more and more clear i can not ahve both worlds. Emotions wants and need are ripping my head apart and everyhting that seemed simple, always get so complicated. I have one new firned here and a few aquantences. I am supposed to go to turkey day desert thursday evening at his house but i don;t know abotu meeting more peopel up here. I am nervous wiht current devlopements and wish things were more certainw iht everything. *sigh*"

Not sure i shoudl ahve done it but I didn't want to stay and all the alkiehal is out of my system. (yes, i know i spelt it wrong)Currently i am quite fried and typing is so hard. I have tons of shit to say but it no come out right. I took me besty firned out for b-day dinner but his present did not arrive in time. I am saddened for i know he will enjoy it greatly. Then i went ot the party... let me tell ys woo fun times. For those of you who couldn't tell, that was just sarcasim. It wasn't bad it was just blah so i had a few drinks and then got blazed. All i really wanted was to get laid but there was no hope of that. And guyy i had been sleeping wiht showed up with his x-gf now gf again and that was akward and they took my x-bf wiht them to hang out. 

I must tell you this thought... you only ever really want sex when you are alone and can't get any. 

It's a sad fact of life and i ahte it and all of you having some. Rarr! I'm so fucked up and driving made me uber paranoid. I want to sleep but i feel compelled to think. Damn insomnia id taking it's toll for letting me sleep as much as i did last week. 

I think the whole reason the party wasn't so good for me, was that i didn't want to see some people. I wanted to see some but on a whole it's hard cuz it remind me of all that i gave and what i am missing. It';s very hard for me. 

I worked 63 hours this week!!!!

I have never worked so much at one time in my entire life. I need a better job! I need to have a life even if it's a small one. I feel like i am doing slave labor, instead of living. All work and no play will make steph an axe weilding psychopath. I should stop before i hurt myself... this is takign too much effort or soemthing. yeah or something. I think i will crawl up to the room here that used to be mine. someone pick me up a life when the head to the corner store."

I don't know where i fit in and i am constantly striving but nothing up here can help me with that. Sometimes you just need to be by yourself, but it really sucks to feel truly lonely. There is no help for it when you intentionally or unitentionally isolate yourself. Although i almost feel i have isolated me from myself. I know somehting is wrong, know it completely but be damned if i know what it is. I know this sounds ridiculous but it's not for you, it's for me.Either something so miniscule it has been ove rlooked but the cascade has created soemthing bigger, or soemthing so cataclimic that i have yet to understand the scope. Lost, but not in this new place about myself. This place is just desolate and i am alone because there are none like me at work and only a glimmer of hope i have meet someone close enough to me, that i will not feel completely alone up here. *sigh* it';s too hard to phrase and i find myself questioning. I have made a new firned up here and for that i am greatful all else just is."

Did some chores around the house and yes that means dishes, i know you all are amazed
Found out there is a D&D game that runs every other sat at a local gaming store, met them this evening... seem very cool and they have room in the game. so all i ahve to do is get the 3.5 stuff necessary to get a character together. this makes me happy so when i start having no life because of work, atleast every other week i will have something social and close by to do.
Checked out the gym i was thinking about joining, but no membership staff was there... lame
Had chinese food with my rents
Already up too late... i need to sleep earlier on the weekends, this is silly
Had no phone calls today... been pretty quiet
I think i am beging to adjust, doesn't mean i liek it tho. just tired of all the driving and money it takes
tomorow lazy days with the exception of returning the movies i rented or maybe i will do that monday
I think i might sleep or run the risk by downloading stuff from kazaa"

I am unsure if i said things i shouldn't have or were too hastey saturday night, just because i was upset and unsatisfied by the way i was comforted earlier in the week. I should have kept my head about myself instead of rambeling for hours saying things that now leave a starnge emptiness. I could have gotten soon what i think i wanted earlier. Then again whenever i get things of that nature i destroy them and they are better left as they are even if their state is confusing and potentially akward. The while thing makes my head hurt because there are mnay x facors involved. I am terrified to make the wrong decision but i want to make the one that is best for me for my own reasons, not anyone else's. That's how i ended up here in my own fucking hell.

"event","1- What do you hate about yourself?
My lack of direction, ambition, want, whatever you call it. I have seemed to stalled out somewhere and can't quite get the motor running again. I do have asperations but the road seems to go nowhere anymore and only in bouts of ranting or fustration do i say i want to get there. I used to have drive and now i can't even finish college, how pathetic! I am doing a tedious job i don't like instead of presuing somehting better.

2- What do you love about yourself?
That I am capable of intelligent thought and not a simpering moron like all too many. That philosphy and existential thought are not foriegn concepts to me. That debating to sunrise over somehting i am passionate about is not a waste of time. That i am slowing becoming unafraid to be whoever i am and if you don't like me; fuck you, someone else will.

3- What is your greatest secret wish?
To have absolute faith in something... not always questioning it and probing it till i have smashed it in search of it's meaning. And if i ever reach that peak of enlightenment to not be afraid and run from it.


4- What are your feelings twords avacados?
Love em! you can't have guacamole with out them. 

5- What is the one question you wish you could ask all of your friends?
I have yet to find an answer to this last one... unless, come vist me? I'm so lonely here in bumfuck working all the time and being alone wiht nothing to do and no free time. Not my best thought put inot it but it is really seperating my real firneds from everyone else. Those who make the effort to visit or go out wiht me when i ask is nice, it's really showing their true colors on the one who don't. Granted there are exceptions to this liek Z (love you hun) who is far away and can't get out too much but i know she wants to and will when she can.

Now with the hatey rant form earlier and this bout wiht honesty... that concludes our broadcast day. GO TO BED!"

"event","well i have discovered one thing from my new job....

Too much introspection is bad.

I am left all day wiht my cds i have gone through dozens of time, my repetitive work and nothing but my wandering mind to occupy me. This is a bad thing. I start thinking about things some good some bad but i have no one to talk to. I don't really relate to anyone in my area. They are all similar, loud gossipy and crude. I""m not sure anyone there would know philosophy or existential thought if the concept bit them on their ass. So me alone internalize all the profound thought to th boring mudane one i have on a daily basis. Letting me stew in my own juices for those who know me only leads to trouble... very typical virgo here when it comes to over analizing. Like for instance this little tid bit. I am not really sure how i came to this conclusion... well amybe i am. The person I am dating told me over a month ago that he was afraid i would leave him for my x. Now said x is banging awya on his x in tronto and quite out of the pictrue... nasty falling out and qusi reconciliation (not really but we can be civil) as some may know. Somehow i ahve managed to turn that thought on it's self. I am stuck here in bumfuck and have no one else, bored and alon all the time unless i travel down there to him or my firneds (most of which are carless). He's planning on taking courses in the fall and proboly find a new job. Now with the course maybe a new job, firned and the club i know he will find someone else and now i am the one feeling liek i will be left cuz he'll be busy and i will be alone. Pretty silly huh? One of the many twisted thing i have cum up with over the last 2 weeks our so.

This job retards my intillect. I want to just get the money i need to take my trip i ahve longed for, but here's the rub... if i go and i like it i am uncertain i will return. Foolish pipe dream, i know but i am not ruling anyhting out at this point. I want to be happy and miserable and working a job that makes me feel less because bubbly airheads who spend all their money on clothes win the bosses favor over people who are nto afraid to be themselves. Simpering morons the lot of em! I wish i atleast had a firned... this is the first place i ahven't had soemone else on my side but i think i am only learning that is hwo it'll be form here on out. I only have myself to depend on for certain... everything else is subject to change at any time. 

Hope is for those who have some, realism keeps everything in perspective."

Silly quizes. Anyway... It's tough come back here to my place all alone when i had a good weekend being social. I do feel like a smuck tho cuz i left my poor little kitty home alone all weekned. I feel horrible. When i got home i had to break in cuz the fucking lock wassticking and try as i may, it would not open for me. i hate keys and doors for that matter. 

As a whole i had a very good weekend. I went to the tenth aniversary of hell. Granted i got there at 11:45 had to drive two hours changed in the parking garage and ran down the street but i made it. It was fun, would have been bettter if i could have gotten there earlier. Saturday was really good tho. I went and got my nails done and cut my hair and almost dyed it a purpley black while i was at it. (I may still in a week or 2) Then i went to a party down south of boston. There were a bunch of manray peopl and i had a good time meeting them and chatting. the sad part is i had to drive and everyone else was blitzed. Then today i went out wiht my dad for lunch and then gamed. Now i am home and happy to be wiht my kitty but sad cuz it's hard to leave and be alone wiht no one to call up and have just come over. I hate being far away. Sadness. 

I have to work tommorow and that makes me more sad. I'm also pretty sleepy. I think i am starting to not make sense and i will go. One last thing tho. The count down has begun!!!!

22 days till my birthday!!!

I know it will suck since most of my birthdays do and i'll proboly won't be able too have get together or outing wiht my firends. They are all busy and my birthday is on a monday. On the plus side i got my rents gift already. they gave it to me when i moved. it's a black leather recliner. It's so comfy. Now all i need is soul calibur 2 and i will be a happy girl. 

Here's to the last important birthday I""ll have and hoping it won't suck. I""m just glad i had a pretty good weekend."

"event","Today was crazy. 
I went to Berwick to see an aprtment my mom saw earlier this week for me. It was huge and decent and in a good area for a good price. They asked me if i liked it i said yes and the next thing i knew i was signing a lease on the spot and was handed the keys to the door and told i could move in as soon as i want. Talk about blowing your mind... I was not expecting it to happen so fast. I kept waffeling on moiving but no i have no choice. Nothing to do but pack oh and tell my roomate.

Then i came home took a quick shower, had a nice meal. Then ran back out the door to go see Lacuna Coil. Mind you i ahve only had 3 hours of sleep today. It was a rocky drive but when we got there things were cool. Ran into alot of people i didn't think would be there. Amanda asked me if i was going to her party and we chatted for abit. Must remeber to call and get direction form her. Then Lacuna coil took the stage and i got odwn firnt and by the end was quite close to the stage. I was bruised and battered but it was awesome. I am uncertain breathing will not be less than painful for ahwile. The i camped out up stairs and waited for type-o to finish. I feel asleep cuz there music is not to my liking and after being nearly crushed i was exhausted.

So tommorw means claning and packing and a unfun conversation if he's even home but if he's not i have a day to myself and those are enjoyable. Just me and my kitty... soon to be me and my kitties as tigger will come to live wiht us when i get situated.

there is so much to do...but sleep first, the rest will follow in time."

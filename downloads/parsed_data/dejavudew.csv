"event","So, the wife and I went to see Terminator: Salvation last night. All in all, I think it was alright. I enjoyed the first 1/2 to 3/4 and then the end kinda fell apart for me. Spoilers and ranting below.

Looking forward to seeing Star Trek and Drag Me To Hell.

Why does this franchise insist that the super-advanced AI that became self-aware and nearly destroyed humanity is also completely inept? Are they trying to say something about humanity or can the writers not keep a coherent idea going for very long? Just in case it really is the case that the AI actually cannot figure these things out on it's own, I've decided to provide some helpful tips for our future overlords:

<ul>
<li>If you're trying to kill John Connor, and you have you big metallic hand around his throat, crush it. Don't try to strangle him.</li>
<li>If you're trying to kill John Conner, and you have Kyle Reece, just kill him. And don't get creative about it either. Just take care of business like the methodical killing machine you are.</li>
<li>While I'm on the subject, if you're trying to make Kyle Reece into an infiltrator robot, kill him first. Clearly he doesn't have to be alive to become one. I don't care if it's harder. You're a nuclear powered machine. You have loads of time and you're in the future.</li>
<li>Don't let John Connor escape without at least trying to catch him. Just because he blows a hole in a wall and jumps through it doesn't mean you can't follow him. You're ambulatory and can clearly jump. Just because you look like a naked man doesn't mean it will make you gay.</li>
<li>Don't give away secrets that undermine your plans. I mean, it's like this AI never watched movies. Why tell him where the chip is or that you played him? I don't care if it means you get to be Helena Bonham Carter. Quote Fight Club instead!</li>
</ul>

There were some other obscenely stupid things that were done for plot reasons. I don't care if a Terminator saves you from almost certain rape and murder, he's clearly trying to infiltrate your base and you have gone most of your life fighting the bastards. Why would you break one loose? Maybe you wouldn't kill it, but you wouldn't let it go either.

Beyond that, it felt to me that the movie was really about the hybrid character and somebody said, ""You can't have a Terminator movie without John Connor. People want to see John Connor. Add more John Connor!"" The original script was probably better (I hope) because the main character, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), was fairly interesting. And so they went off and invented John Connor and a pregnant wife into the mix. And then the same asshole said, ""What is this movie about? How will people understand that the theme is about the human heart and mind?"" So, the writer, exasperated and down to the wire, screamed, ""Fuck it!"" and added 15 minutes of really bad heart metaphors at the end. And the producer said it was good.

Overall, the movie was alright. I liked seeing different types of terminators for different types of jobs and how vast the world had grown. The artistic vision seemed incredible to me and very consistent with prior versions. The wife took this as a way of making more sellable toys, but, even if she's right (and she <em>always</em> is), I enjoyed it.

I decided I wanted to read each document and understand it. One of my favorite bits of contract language was in the Deed of Trust and I'm now tempted to go try and learn a little about the history of that paragraph. The Deed of Trust ultimately states what can happen if the Lender doesn't get paid (i.e. hire big, scary Italians and what exactly they're allowed to break). This part is in bold in the contract, but I changed that to show exactly what I found so amusing.

<blockquote>
If Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender or Trustee shall give notice of the time, place and terms of sale by posting and filing the notice at least 21 days prior to sale as provided by Applicable Law. Lender shall mail a copy of the notice to Borrower in the manner prescribed by Applicable Law. Sales shall be made at public vendue. The sale must begin at the time stated in the notice of sale or not later than three hours after that time and between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. <strong>on the first Tuesday of that month</strong>.
</blockquote>

Apparently, the day has something to do with whether or not the court will be able ot be around for the ""vendue"". Also, it turns out that ""vendue"" is a real word (yeah, nobody typoed that one) that means ""auction"".

The most amazing thing about those forms was what they didn't (or probably couldn't) say. ""Applicable Law"" trumps everything and I, amonst most everyone else, have no idea what bearing ""Applicable Law"" has on the contract. And since none of us are prescient, noone knows what ""Applicable Law"" will have on the contract later. So, I'm thinking, ""Let's pass some laws that let me keep the house without having to pay the Lender. Oh hey! That's how that bailout thing works."" ;)"

Other things I didn't know about were also problematic. So, it's a good thing I'm not your home inspector (or my home inspector, for that matter). Dan Tucker is a freaking dynamo when it comes to this sort of thing (just in case anyone's looking for a house in BCS).

In it's current state, the house is livable and would probably just need some regular minor repairs for awhile. Personally, I'd rather not wait for the house to sink into the ground while the roof flies off (although I think insurance would probably cover the roof). Instead, we're going to get some estimates on repairs the house would need and try to renegotiate the contract. We have until the 24th before we're out of our option period."

One of my favorites is:

<blockquote>""This is one of the better books I've read all in caps on the subject. I am thankful that Amazon has given voice that so many crazy people shouting at traffic don't have. 

I was initially concerned due to the disclaimer ""THIS BOOK MAY BE REVISED: BECAUSE OF COMPUTER DICTATORS"" and worry for the safety of the author. Has the robot uprising/rapture begun? No need to worry, the message is to not use birth control and seek repentance, in that order? I will try it both ways and see if the sex is hotter, or the repentance. Based on the results I would like the challenge the author to a karate match and we will see who is filled with the Holy Spirit.""</blockquote>

"event","Our strategy worked! We paid a little more for the house than asking (~$5k), but it still seemed like a fair price for the home. The contract is really just awaiting a signature and we'll start inspections next week. 

The house itself is a 4 bed/2 bath on an acre in College Station. It's relatively close to work and the neighborhood is fairly woodsy without really causing you to be lightyears away from civilization (or city sewage). This would also make us the poor folk in the neighborhood as some of the houses there have sold for $400k (and we are nowhere near that number). I think it's a nice house to live in and a nice investment property as well -- I mean, it sold in 2 days on the market, so we're excited with this one.

There were some unusual things about this particular contract. The main one is that she doesn't want to move out until June because she's getting married. So we had a couple of options here. One would have been to close in June, but the issue there is that she could change her mind before closing (and carry a hefty penalty for doing so) or intrest rates could go back up (they're at a nice low number right now). You can lock in an interest rate for an extended period of time, but it costs extra money (I think either .5 or 1 point). Another option, which we went with, would be to take ownership of the home and then rent the house back out to her. We didn't negotiate an ""at-cost"" rent, but it's pretty close. The difference in price wouldn't be enough for us to have to worry about 2 housing payments and should let us keep a low interest rate. I got an estimate this morning that used 5.125%. Compare that to the 6.25% I was looking at a year ago and the monthly payments are significantly different."

Personally, I blame MySpace.

Some fun facts about this:
<ul>
<li>Websites are still stupid about passwords. Even bank websites. It's pretty crappy when gmail and hotmail let me set stronger passwords than, say, most of the banking institutions I deal with. A 10 character password is not nearly as secure as the 20 character passwords I have in mind. The ability to use the full ASCII charset means it's harder for brute force and approximation methods to work well. I'd rather not get my bank and credit accounts hacked alongside my email, thankyouverymuch.</li>
<li>Websites are incredibly inconsistent about the passwords they allow. Some allow symbols. Some don't. Some add a small level of dictionary protection (only two words, in the example I found. You're retarded for thinking that only blocking ""password"" and your bank's name is going to secure your website.).</li>
<li>Websites are completely incompetant about their restrictions on passwords. Take this little gem ""It can't contain two separated numbers (i.e., Abc12ef34 would be invalid)"". GRAAAAHHH!!!</li>

"event","So, in .NET 2.0, you <em>still</em> can't serialize a TimeSpan (which is stupid because you can certainly parse them from a string and format one into a string). There are a series of workaround for this, my favorite being to use ToString and TimeSpan.Parse() on a string property that you don't intend on using. So, I thought I'd get clever and try something like the following.

<pre>
private TimeSpan? _testTimeout;

[XmlElement(""testTimeout""), 
Obsolete(""Do not reference this property. Use TestTimeout instead."", true)]
public string TestTimeoutSerializer
{
   get { return (_testTimeout.HasValue) ? _testTimeout.ToString() : null; }
   set { _testTimeout = (value != null) ? TimeSpan.Parse(value) : (TimeSpan?)null; }
}
		
[XmlIgnore()]
public TimeSpan TestTimeout
{
   get { return _testTimeout ?? TimeSpan.Zero; }
   set { _testTimeout = value; }
}
</pre>The beauty here would be that anyone that decided to actually refer to TestTimeoutSerializer would get a nasty compiler message and have to change their code (which is great because you don't want people touching the property). AND, it would still serialize to a string.

Well guess what? XmlSerializer is smarter than you (well, me, anyway). It doesn't want to serialize an obsolete property. Why would it? IT'S O-B-S-O-L-E-T-E, STUPID! ::sigh:: Being insulted by an API isn't my idea of a good time. 

Sure, I could fire up PostSharp and add the serializable stuff after the fact. I could possibly even solve this with extension methods -- I have no idea, I've never used them. But, really, I just want the serialization bug fixed. It just seems...so...basic and such a useful feature. Why hide behind serializing ints which you're supposed to magically know are ""in seconds"" even though the configuration element simply says ""Timeout"". Sure, there's documentation and experienced developers know the units of most things off-hand, but, surely, Microsoft can do better than that.

Also, check out the setter for TestTimeoutSerializer, notably, ""(TimeSpan?)null"". So far as I can tell, it's completely necessary. Why? TimeSpan.Parse returns a TimeSpan and it isn't compatible with a null. But, somehow, TimeSpan? is compatible with a TimeSpan. Neither should matter because the types should be implicitly converting towards the TimeSpan? and not the first argument in the list. I suppose I could have also casted the TimeSpan.Parse into a TimeSpan?, but I think that's equally ridiculous. And when <em>was</em> the last time you explicitly cast a null to something anyway. <em>This particular nothing would have been a TimeSpan if it weren't, well, nothing.</em>

So, here's hoping that they spend the small amount of time it would take to fix this crap before the next version."

"event","So, we found another house that we're happy with, but the major issue with it is that we think it's priced $50k too much -- it needs a new roof, kitchen renovation, electrical renovation (to a fully-grounded system), bathroom renovations, etc for it's current price-point to make sense. It's part of an estate and both of the inheritors live out of state (one is currently out of the country). We tried to low-ball them, slightly,. to get them to drop the price some and it kindof worked. The price would still have to drop another $25k. The real problem there is that we now don't have a lot of room for back-and-forth negotiation (meaning, we'd only be willing to go up on our initial bid $15k max, so we can't exactly meet in the middle of their counter and any bump on our part would be relatively small or would immediately push us right next to our ""walk-away"" price). So, we're waiting a week or so and then will respond to their counter-bid, likely with a slightly higher bid. We can always wait.

The psychology of all of this really facinates me, just like it did when I was buying a car. With a car, the sellers didn't have emotional baggage about the car, so I guess it was a little easier. In this case, it's annoying because I think it means we won't buy the house. The price is too high (which is why it hasn't already sold) and it's going to take a lot of convincing for them to drop it down. And by ""convincing"", I mean playing a series of psychological games in order to manipulate them into doing what we want. They had it appraised, but we think that it is, at best, what the bank would be willing to take a risk on (in terms of a loan) and not the market value of the house. We're basically telling them that their parent's home, likely their childhood home, isn't worth what the appraiser they hired is telling them it's worth."

Cujo, The Green Mile, The Tommyknockers, Carrie, The Dark Tower, the book about the killer car, and so on. My love for King's work mostly involved loads of ahort stories, some medium-sized stories (ala Four Seasons) with the occasional novel (The Stand, The Eyes of the Dragon (eh), and Salem's Lot).

Misery is supposed to be King's best work. So, I read it. Finally. And I'm left feeling a little wierd about it. First, I reeeealy want to sit down and write something. Not a blog entry or an essay on some philosophical or programming issue, but some crazy work of fiction (which would undoubtedly suck). The book, and if you haven't read it, you should, involves writing and being a writer heavily. It also involves a crazy ex-nurse named Annie Wilkes (and I really want to see Kathy Bates play her in the movie). In that, and the other themes, it's a wonderful story. I think you really see his writing muscle perform some wonderful tasks.

But, it wasn't till towards the end that I really got ""pulled in"" and started to enjoy the story. Oddly enough, I hate most endings and I thought this one not only ended well but stuck with me. Maybe it's because I was a little too uncultured and didn't recognize the reference to Arabian Nights.

"event","Well, we inspected the house on E. 30th and, in spite of the previous inspection and the comments on the sellers disclosure, we found deteriorating asbestos insulation on the pipes inside of the walls. So, that turned out to be a deal-killer (as you might imagine). We probably could have talked them down into a price range that made sense, but we just don't have the startup capital to deal with asbestos abatement.

On the plus side, now I know what to look for (white powdery stuff).

It seems like we never quite make it past the initial inspection. Maybe next time."

"event","I'm not particularly timely in posting about this, in part because I'm honestly surpised that California passed it. If you haven't heard, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8_(2008)"">proposition 8</a> redefines marriage in California to exist only between a man and a woman.

Also it was surprising to me that so many people outside of California tried to get involved. Bryan/College Station didn't get <em>nearly</em> that sort of attention for it's propositions (and we're talking money for the library, folks). My own jealousy aside, I get the attention on proposition 8, but I really don't understand what it has to do with, say, Utah or the people living in it. Is it just a ""one-step closer"" kinda thing? I guess the abolition of polygamy in order to gain statehood helped to let them approve of such a law.

<lj-cut>

Emotions run pretty high on this. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HpTBF6EfxY"">Keith Olberman</a> made a typical emotional plea against those that voted for proposition 8. Personally, I don't like it when journalists try to play my emotions or otherwise look like they're going to cry when a situation doesn't effect them. (I'm also not a fan.) Given that my sister-in-law is a gay Californian, I can see why she might be upset over it. It impacts her life and impacts my family. I'm going to ignore those arguments (because I'm a soulless bastard, obviously).

Unfortunately, I don't think there are good statistics on this one-way or the other. Take the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/photo_search.php?oid=84999030353&view=all"">charts and graphs</a> an high-school friend of mind posted on the facebook group (coincidentally, the reason I remembered about it and decided to post). Not a single one of those slides accomodates ""intact married homosexuals"". In fact, it's comparing marriage vs. cohabitation vs. divorce vs. single parent. You might be thinking ""aha! cohabitation!"", but there's no qualifier there about whether it's a heterosexual couple or a homosexual couple. In effect, they have nothing to do with proposition 8 (sorry Dustin). But even if they did, it's a difficult argument to make because I think there's very little statistical evidence (in the US, at least) that allows us to compare identical types of marriages between same-sex and different-sex couples. Maybe in 20 years thanks to Massachusets.

As far as I can tell, this is essentially a religious argument turned into a political one and I have never really understood it. Take <a href=""http://www.antiochian.org/node/18321"">this letter by the Orthodox bishops in California</a>. There are several main concerns here. 1.) If I have to call it marriage, how do I spread the truth of my belief and practice it publicly? 2.) We're doing well as a country because, in part, we're basically founded on Christian principles. If you change that, you'll screw us all. 3.) Marriage is sacred.

1.) This, I think, is the bigger issue. The church is constantly vigilant about terminology because even subtle changes in meaning can have drastic theological impact and social shifts in meaning mean a heck of a lot more work in evangelism. The trinity is a good example. Marriage is no different. The church will have to continually solve this problem the way it always has. Rail against new definitions, add qualifiers to their words, and create a new vernacular. Call it a ""church marriage"" or a ""sanctified"" or ""holy"" marriage.

2.) Whether or not I agree with this point is irrelevant, but it ultimately depends on us adhering to those principles for the argument to be correct. I don't think this legislation would change that. In fact, we could have no laws and still abide by those principles.

3.) Holy matrimony is sacred. I'm not sure what the state does really is sacred. When Brook and I were getting married, our priest explained that the church was recognizing our marriage. The government does the same thing, but per its own standards. And those standards are not always in line with the Orthodox church. So, I wouldn't really think that a non-church wedding would be sacred. Emotionally important to the people involved, possibly, but not sacred. All the more reason to protect marriage inside of the church.

So, why is legal recognition (on this issue) such a big deal?

"event","So, we got pre-approved for $30-40k more mortgage than we wanted (and the lender said we could get more but didn't press it since she knows we're not interested). Beforehand, we got a good faith estimate on the loan and the monthly payment was initially a little shocking. I had to make a budget to get over the difference between our current budget in a cheap apartment and one that involves a house. But we're solid without stretching, so that's good.

So, looks like we might turn into homeowners soon. We're going to take another look at the house we like on Monday and, if all goes well, make them an offer. If inspections and any other negotiations go well after that, we could pull it off in the next few months.

So far, we've seen a nice, normal house, a nice old home (1900s) with a kitchen problem, and a potentially nice old home (1950s) in disrepair whose owners are asking at least $30k too much (or need to perform at least $30k more in work first). 

We also went to another house that turned out to be under contract. Seems like every time we start doing this, we run into at least one house that goes under contract and doesn't have its status updated to reflect it. That house might have some foundation issues from some things I saw while I walked around outside, so probably no big loss there."

"event","A few things up front.

First, this is about everything you'd expect it to be. It could make a good late-night rental when you're willing to laugh at something trying to take itself seriuosly. Mark Wahlberg is terrible. The heroes are invincible. Ballistics gets thrown out the window (we'll get to this). I laughed through most of the movie (and then more talking about it afterwards).

Second, this movie makes that SNL skit about Mark Wahlberg talking to animals look hillarious (prior to watching the movie, I just didn't get it).

Third, if Bruce Campbell or Nathan Fillion had been cast as the lead (and maybe a different director that would have a vision of Bruce Campbell or Nathan Fillion as Max Payne), this would have been a phenomenal movie. I guess even Bruce has standards.

Apparently, this wasn't at all true to the game, save for one really terrible scene. I never played Max Payne, so what do I know. The scene, however, has Max standing in a warehouse. At this point, everything goes slow motion. An armed thug runs into the warehouse on a balcony behind Max, kneels, and starts firing. Max, armed with a pump-shotgun, leaps backwards and fires over his head 3 times, killing the thug. Of course, the thug completely misses ""our hero"" and, instead, hits vials of blue liquid that are on the side of Max that then shatter and throw the liquid everywhere. The bullet-time effect and exploding blue liquid is all very pretty until you realize that the bullets the thug is shooting should be coming from *behind* Max and not from the side of him.

However, I imagine the game had a relatively invincible Max Payne, just like the movie. One that could take a shotgun blast from 2 feet away and still run around like nothing happened (except that his leather jacket now has tiny holes in it with no blood coming out). I also imagine the people shooting at you were relatively inept and would miss with ridiculous accuracy. So ridiculous, that you could take out a cadre of sub-machine gun wielding, bulletproof armor-wearing ""security guards"" with a single pistol that you're firing over your back (not even looking) while running through a building with a bunch of glass windows."

"event","Well, I watched about as much as I could/wanted to. Here we go.

Biden won. He knows how to debate.

Palin did pretty well for her. Her advisors finally came through during that debate cram on McCain's ranch. It's pretty sad when success in a debate only means not failing though. She's not very good at dodging (or answering) questions that don't directly tow the line and I suspect that's a result of her coaches trying to get her to not fail. She needs to stop ""flirting with the camera"" (all that winking she kept doing was really annoying). She needs to work on her tone of voice. She sounds nervous -- who wouldn't be (oh yeah, any other polician) -- and angry. It makes her sound kind of like a child, especially when you compare it to Biden. 

Luckily for her, this is the only VP debate during this election. Now, if she can just fix her interviewing skills...

[Edit: Ooohh. Palin just got a point (on challenging a fact about whether or not a commander said something). Congrats! (However, please stop smiling while he speaks. Yes, you should be proud that you got him, but the smile makes it look bad.)]

[Edit 2: Unfortunately, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/08/afghanistan.surge/index.html"">her counter to his fact was false</a>.]"

"event","Anyone else supremely pissed off about this? 

The financial world has tons of risky opportunities and noone knows this better than the financial institutions providing them. They royally screwed themselves (and us with them) through more than questionable money-making schemes. And the institutions we're bailing out made tons of money off of this over the years (and spent it all).

And, I'm not sure it really accomplishes what we want (although I don't know anything about economics). Seems to me that housing prices should drop and that a market-based solution makes sense. If it means that banks aren't willing to give out loans, so be it. Isn't that what we want? We can't base our entire financial future on heavy risks and inflated prices due to the risks we had to take to get them.

On the flip-side, it's sad that people got caught up in this so heavily (around 3.5 million people) and I think programs that potentially help them keep their homes (at increased cost -- why not refinance a 30yr into a 45yr) would probably be wise from an economical, and potentially social (e.g. decreasing in crime), standpoint.

Personally, I'm less concerned about the ""it's not fair!"" or ""why can't I get bailed out too?"" arguments because I'm not a petulant child. I don't think fairness enters into it -- although I would like to see some more egregious violators charged with something. At this point, it's an economic (and behavioral) issue. How do we navigate the economy back in the correct direction without opening a ""get out of jail free"" card to jerks that want to abuse the future system for their own gain?

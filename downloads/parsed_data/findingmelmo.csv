I'm trapped, and somehow my will to pin myself&nbsp;down into the&nbsp;dirt and rubble&nbsp;is greater than that which compells me to let go of the past, of him.

I&nbsp;don't want to forget him. He was my first love, my first roomate and second cooperating household/family, and&nbsp;the first I&nbsp;gave my body to with my whole self. He's the only man who has ever brought me flowers, made me heartfelt cards, and indulged in my hello kitty fascination with me. He is the only man who has ever loved me.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don't want to remember either because thinking of good memeories only makes me think of all that I&nbsp;did to help destroy the relationship.&nbsp;Guilt ensues."

"event","I&nbsp;have this false sense that I&nbsp;am the center of the earth, and that I&nbsp;have the power to let everyone down. Hah. I&nbsp;need to stray from my dependence on others' happiness, and quit letting it effect my own so much to the pint where I&nbsp;become a nervous, bumbling wreck.&nbsp;

So, I'm not going out west and towing someone else's crap to CA even though I've been saying &quot;Don't worry, I've got it covered. This will definately happen no matter what.&quot; for the last 6 weeks. She's a grandma who moved out to CA without much notice to be with her sick mother. She is awaiting her grandchild's baby things. I&nbsp;promised her she could count on me. I&nbsp;feel obligated to this promise even though I&nbsp;have never seen her in my life, and only talked to her half a dozen times. I&nbsp;REHA -EEEEEALLY don't want to make that contradictory phone call to explain that I&nbsp;am full of shit.&nbsp;

Okay, so it's not my fault directly, but rather, indirectly for counting on this trip with help from an undependable person--my former roommate who had been gone boozing on Beaver Island all summer collecting unemployment, who had agreed upon the trip eagerly, but had put little if any effort into planning with me. We were going to use her car since it has a hitch, and she wanted to see the Grand Canyon while I&nbsp;retrieved my stuff from storage in Tempe, and she wanted to stop in Texas along the way to visit a good friend of hers. We were going to be reimbursed by Ann, the friendly grandmother who wanted her stuff delivered from MI for the trip there. Pretty sweet huh? All good and dandy. Except for she is a lying, manipulative, back-stabbing, coward. I&nbsp;found this out Sep 30, the day before rent was due and I&nbsp;got an icky feeling in my stomach and the urge to call her to see the status on rent. She had been gone a lot, like I&nbsp;said, and she wanted to have someone take over her room for October because she found a cheaper place in Charlevoix with another friend. I&nbsp;was of the understanding that, you know, like the lease says, um, that she would pay rent if she did not find someone to replace her (of which responsibility she tried to pawn off on me...?). I&nbsp;had considered that she might just skip town, but I&nbsp;wanted to trust her. I&nbsp;guess it was the lack of communication of any kind that tipped me off, but I&nbsp;didn't want to believe that someone who I&nbsp;had grown so close to, respected, and trusted so much over the past year, could be capable of that kind of&nbsp; negligence towards a friend. I&nbsp;was wrong. She packed up her stuff, and I&nbsp;wouldn't have know she was even moving if I&nbsp;hadn't called that day. She could of, and she probably planned like the coward she is, to simply grab her stuff an run without word. I&nbsp;mean, she DID do a great job of hiding the fact that she didn't have enough money until the very last second...or rather had taken the money she says she didn't have, but really&nbsp; DID have, and gave it to someone else for a different place to stay. &quot;I&nbsp;don't have the money,&quot; she says. &quot;Ummmm, I'll be evicted, Andrea,&quot; I&nbsp;say. And she thinks I&nbsp;have the money to pay HER rent alongside mine, HER&nbsp;late fees, our other shared fees, and what we will inevitable be charged for all the damage done to the apt? Or even if she thought I&nbsp;would take after her and be stupid or irresponsible enough let my credit and my rental history go to shit only to get sued by the Arbors, she would just leave me with no place to live? Fuck that. 

I've decided that this journal entry is going to be the way I&nbsp;tell her that she is getting sued, not by the Arbors, but by me for her half of all the expenses. I&nbsp;hope she looks forward to having one less friend in the world, and waaaay more expense than she bargained for. Savor the court fees, you childish, heartless bitch. :) Only wittle babies avoid their problems in such a manner. 

Or maybe I'll just catch her by surprise when she recieves the court documents after expecting that she can leave me with all the expense and stress with no consequences. 

So anyway, I&nbsp;have to call Ann and explain this to her. Gah. AND I&nbsp;have to figure out a way to pay all of this rent and try to avoid a late fee. ANd I&nbsp;have an exam on Monday.&nbsp; And I&nbsp;am just freaking out. I've never sued anyone before, and I&nbsp;never want to have to do this again in my lifetime. I&nbsp;need to do this, and yet, I&nbsp;still can't help but feel shitty about the way this ended up. Revenge is not that sweet, not at all, but it's less bitter than feeling helpless with physical and mental burden and pinned down by betrayal. At least, if anything, this is proactive. And I&nbsp;need to stick up for myself."

So, instead of finishing Twilight, I&nbsp;started reading like three books at once...I&nbsp;don't think that counts...however, I'm going to finish it. I&nbsp;retract my previous statement on the last entry. Indeed I&nbsp;am a horny, sexually repressed, teenager at heart, and I&nbsp;do in fact masturbate to the book like everyone else.

AND, I&nbsp;actually have gotten off my ass more frequently to exercise. I&nbsp;enjoy it, but am looking for some good workout music. Sometimes I&nbsp;listen to techno or heavy metal, but I&nbsp;always get strange looks, which annoys and disrupts my workout, I&nbsp;have to listen to it really loud because the eliptical squeaks. I don't know how much weight I&nbsp;have lost because I&nbsp;don't have a scale.

ALSO, the weather the last few days has been great!&nbsp;Reading in the sun is the best. I'm gonna pick up some mineral based sunscreen tomorrow because it reflects all rays, not just the one's that burn you to tell you you've had too much. 

I'm just going to end it, 'cuz I'm tired."

Week 1
1)&nbsp;Lose 3 lbs or more
2)&nbsp;Talk to councilors about interests, set up an apt to talk to someone in that field
3)&nbsp;Finish reading Twilight, start another book


To lose the three pounds,&nbsp; I&nbsp;must start replacing diet soda with water, sleeping and using the computer less, walking to work, exercising, and making better eating decisions. I&nbsp;should start packing my lunch for work. 

On Monday I&nbsp;will print out some resumes at the school for job applications and talk to a councilor about my interest in biological research and the environment. Hopefully I&nbsp;can get some contacts from the councilor and get some direction.

I'm sick of starting books and not finishing them. Twilight is ok, but I'll be damned if I&nbsp;don't finish it!

I&nbsp;will report with an update.

So anywho, I'm possibly going dancing tonight!&nbsp;I&nbsp;love it! And I&nbsp;am meeting a hot lesbian girl (strictly platonic)&nbsp; who moved here with her gf from Cali recently. I'm uber excited&nbsp; for meeting someone who is also newer to the area and looking for friends. She posted an add on craigslist :)

He was not there, and I&nbsp;got a weird look, but the manager agreed to take the stinky jacket and give it to him later. I&nbsp;grabbed a diet pepsi, feeling like I&nbsp;got a load off my mind, and I&nbsp;drove home. I&nbsp;was glad to get rid of that thing, lurking like a ghost. On the same plane of thought, I&nbsp;also deleted his and his brother AJ's number so I&nbsp;would not have to see them in my contact list anymore.

I&nbsp;had a good talk with my aunt about it all, and she seems to understand having experienced similar relationships with jackasses, and she encouraged me to get past this blow to the ego. So that is what I&nbsp;did to get past it...no calling for an explanation or to resolve things, just getting rid of any evidence. I&nbsp;am learning that not everything has an evident ending, sometimes I&nbsp;have to end things without verbal truncation.

"event","I&nbsp;was simply looking for interesting people who wanted to talk late at night while I&nbsp;couldn't (and can never) sleep. Damnit, I&nbsp;always seem to develope feelings for people I&nbsp;have not actually met...I&nbsp;think it's a combination of the fantasy and the simulated closeness one feels from feeling comfortable sharing tmi...I'm a sucker for people who open up, and that tends to happen with the whole anonymity factor.&nbsp; 

He finishes my sentences, is highly intuitive and conscious to social nuances, shares my major concerns and empathizes with my experiences and thoughts, shares the same phylosophies I&nbsp;hold to be true, has an earily similar sarcastic/corny/quirky sense of humour (which I&nbsp;find hard to find) and we both offer encouragement and advice. And I&nbsp;know he feels something special with me too. And on top if it all, he seems to understand me. It's not just agreeing...he phrases my thoughts better than I&nbsp;can phrase them myself...and english is his second langauge. Basically, he is like me with a penis and a German accent, except he is a little less daydreamy, and he is more directed/ established in life. I&nbsp;am more resilient, however, and my dreams when put into action are very powerful. We both tend too think too much or over-analyze things.

He streams music for me that fits the mood of our conversations (mostly VNV Nation, Depeche Mode, Chris Isaak, NIN, Eric Clapton, various techno/trance/oldies) , collects music and online book&nbsp; files to send to me, looks for me online, and like to talk to me via microphone while I&nbsp;type on aim. He is fond of tea (which I&nbsp;find very charming w/ him always pausing our conversations to brew another pot of tea), like me is not sure he wants kids because of a need for movement and independence, and is motivated by change like traveling. He is sort of sharing my lonliness and confusion right now, which we seam to help ease in one another. He also shares my intensity and passion. 

Alas, it happened once before with Danny who lived over 2000 miles away (not exactly the same of course), and I&nbsp;just had to top that one and fall for a 22 year-old man who work for the German military in Berlin. Now, before you go on thinking, &quot;Hasn't this bitch learned ANYTHING?!&quot;, I&nbsp;know nothing is going to come of it. I'm not moving to Germany. He's not moving here. I'm&nbsp; not going to take photos of us and put it into those &quot;make me a baby&quot; programs to see how sickeningly cute our offspring would be...it's just, I&nbsp;need to figure out how to find this shit where I&nbsp;am...and it's almost an analogy for anything in life whether it be about relationships or anything else...you have to find what you need where you are; look for the happiness where you are. Because ultimately, if you can't be semi-happy in one place, it probably has to do with yourself, and simply another location is going to do little to help you.&nbsp; &quot;I&nbsp;can't take to the sky before I&nbsp;like it on the ground.&quot;

I&nbsp;mean, there's got to be similar, understanding gentlemen within a decent distance somewhere around here. The hard part is looking, because I&nbsp;hate it, and I simply won't do it. Instead, I&nbsp; have to keep on and&nbsp; be open and patient until it comes to me.

I'm supposed to be happy because my 21st birthday is in 2 days...and all I&nbsp;can do is just yawn, sigh, and go back to sleep. For a while now, I've been having this intuitive sense that a metaphorical wall of spikes like the one in that Indiana Jones movie is slowly but surely baring down on me, reminding me with a deafening rumble every second of the day. Is that what a panic attack feels like? Only dilluted enough that it last the entire day.

I'm still mourning the loss of Danny, there are no friends to distract me as they are all becoming fucking rocket scientists or brain surgeons off at a far away University (and the telly is not enough!), and I&nbsp;have the added pressure of trying to dissect myself and figure out what in the hell I want to do with myself for the next 5-10 years. 

1)&nbsp;Fucking lonely
2) Fucking lonely
3) Nervous and unsure of my future, watching my better friends and loved ones &quot;skate&quot; on by (not to imply it is easier for them, but sometimes it can feel that way because I&nbsp;feel so inadequit)
4) Disbelief in finding any sort of good mate, and resentment/disgust towards the opposite sex in general
5) Fucking lonely
6) Fucking lonely
7) Feeling guilty for being such an idiot


My self-esteem was based on my partner (Danny) for 4 years, I think because I&nbsp;had been so wounded by other men and I was too young at 16 to know better when I&nbsp;got w/ him. I&nbsp;thought that since he was older,&nbsp; he could protect me from hurt inflicted by bad encounters w/ men and my parents who had abandoned me by kicking me out of the house. I&nbsp;trusted in that based on his age and his hollow words (because him being online to talk with me was the only consistent thing I&nbsp;could cling to), well at least inflated words which probably had good intentions at the time. I am mostly at fault almost more so than he is because I put too much faith into a fantasy I created in my head. I'm not saying our whole relationship was a lie, there was some true love there (and some great times), yet my expectations were too high, and he has too many problems of his own that I discovered while in AZ (most of it later on into the relationship). And even when I discovered that he couldn't give me what I&nbsp;needed, that there was a lot more to him than just the good things I&nbsp;had seen in the breif visits and the words online, I&nbsp;tried to extract them from him. Then when I couldn't extract them directly, I&nbsp;started giving too much of myself to him so he could see how much I&nbsp;loved him, how much I&nbsp;was sacrificing, what a stupid, pathtic &quot;bleeding-heart&quot; I was... and maybe change his mind. Maybe he will change his mind about not wanting to marry or have kids (not that I&nbsp;wanted them anytime soon, but I didn't want to rule out the possibility for in the future entirely). Maybe he will want me physically again. Maybe he will stop looking for intimate emotional support from other women which should have been shared with me. Maybe he will be&nbsp; excited to see me instead of take me for granted and sit on the computer all day saying that we are &quot;always together.&quot; Maybe I can make him happy and be his saving grace. Once I do that, he'll surely love me back and show it. 

Love, lonliness, and ignorance make one a fool. A fool I am. I&nbsp;was holding on so tight to that relationship, so sure he could not hurt me because I&nbsp;had tried my hardest to show my affection and be a spectacular girlfriend. Maybe I could make him feel my love and he would respond to it. I gave him chance after chance after chance after chance. I&nbsp;felt the relationship deteriorating, and I&nbsp;would inquire about the issues we were having only to either have the issues denied altogether or made to seem less serious then they actually were. I&nbsp;asked him outright if he wanted to leave because I could sense his resentment towards me &quot;making&quot; him move out w/ me into a not so wonderful, stressful life...a poor adult life. He would never be open and honest with me about those particular feelings! I&nbsp;believe it was because he did not want to hurt me...but Jesus, it's 10 times worse now. Alll I&nbsp;wanted from him near the end, was not his romantic love that I finally accepted I could not receive from him ever, but simply blatant, concise, honesty! I knew half the shit, but I wanted to hear it from him...to be treated like a respected adult so it could have ended as gracefully as possible for a break-up. The most hurtful part was that. It did not end on an honest note; he lied to me to the very end. I&nbsp;got no relief, and I&nbsp;deserved at least that, damnit! 

LESSON&nbsp;LEARNED: YOU&nbsp;CANNOT&nbsp;TAKE&nbsp;ANYTHING&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;SOMEONE&nbsp;THAT&nbsp;THEY&nbsp;ARE&nbsp;UNWILLING/UNABLE&nbsp;TO&nbsp;GIVE. Not love, not truth, not security, not sex, not a phone call, not a fucking piece of gum...not anything. It's not going to happen if it hasn't happened already! Just ride on by.

Why did I&nbsp;see the times where he disrespected me, disowned me, and took me for granted and waste so much time staying all the while riding the bus to bring him lunch at work and trying to make him happy in whatever way I&nbsp;could.? Because I&nbsp;felt it but I&nbsp;wanted him&nbsp; to&nbsp; tell me himself, not push me away in hopes I&nbsp;would end it.&nbsp;  Because I&nbsp;love him. I&nbsp;love a sneaky, passive, deceiving, fake of a man. Adolescent w/ adult charm who says he want one thing but really wants another. He's&nbsp; fatal because he seems like one of the best, most caring human beings you will ever meet. And I&nbsp;still love him. Why?&nbsp;<br /><br />He still wants to be friends!?!?!?? Would he REALLY treat a friend like that!?!? WHAT&nbsp;A&nbsp;GODDAMN&nbsp;JOKE! POS! And yet, I&nbsp;still want him in my life!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH! *beats head against nearest wall*<br /><br />Oh my God, it hurts. And there's nothing I&nbsp;can do. <br /><br />I&nbsp;was told today that grieving comes in waves.

Why do I&nbsp;like you so much, and trust you with my feeling so much when I&nbsp;don't even know you...at all.&nbsp;Why do I&nbsp;think about you in this &quot;reality&quot; my mind creates as much as the virtual reality? It's all electric signals, isn't it? Are they so different? Maybe the Matrix is a reality and we sit in adjacent bubbles of the mulcified dead, our heads connected to the control center like an ipod connects to a PC. Maybe there is no Germany, no United States of America, no Atlantic ocean. 

Why do I&nbsp;NEED you when you have so litte that is tangible to give? Even emotion is stinted, misinterpreted,&nbsp;and destorted within this virtual world. But somehow it is not cheapened, but the point sharpened lik a lead pencil. My imagination is powerful. I&nbsp;know this because of my dreams.

Because. I&nbsp;imagine that behind every litte smilyface you type in response to my comments, is a little smirk with a head nod looking at me amusedly, black eyes glittering, and not a comment at all. The quiet seduces me; the comfort suffocates me into an eased state of mind. Dumbed down. But willingly, almost desperately. I&nbsp;submit to you and show you my belly like a sleek&nbsp;feline. I&nbsp;feel your eyes when you talk to me. 

You appreciate me, need ME even in a way because you look for me. You stay up all night for me and stream music for me, talk to me. You let me talk while you take it in. You spin things in a positive direction and express a pseudo-paternal care for me which I&nbsp;find endearing and extremely sexy. I&nbsp;know you like me, but you don't say it like I&nbsp;do...don't roll over on your back and expose yout heart to my claw. I&nbsp;have claws, but they are only used in another type of carnal activity, so don't you worry. I&nbsp;want&nbsp; that, but at the same time I&nbsp;would resent it. I&nbsp;want someone stronger than me. The talldarkandhandsome,&nbsp;silent, strong&nbsp; type. Like you. I&nbsp;like you. I&nbsp;respect you. I&nbsp;want to fuck you. The end."

I&nbsp;can't&nbsp; hear his voice on a phone even, and he doesn't have time for me. Or won't make time. 

It seems to me he is putting the relationship on pause like he would a a video game. I&nbsp;said communication was make or break, and he decided on the latter because he can't handle the long distance and the stress of worrying about making me happy, finances, and classes. He want to focus on his education right now alone, and not be in a relationship at all for the time being. It seems smart. Really, but my brain doesn't seem to be able to reason with my broken and disfigured excuse for a heart. Just Shards. It screams and echoes in dullness of my body cavity. And it's just too much to take with none of my friends around, no phone to call, and nothing of significant value to distract myself with. It's funny how sorrow makes important, sunny things like school or progress in general seem dreary and unpressing.Another distortion of the heart.

Another fucking emo post. I&nbsp;feel like I'm regressing. Or not moving forward. Treading water, but my lungs are slowly filling up with searing salt water. And now I&nbsp;don't even have him to help me through it. 

Maybe things would be better if I&nbsp;had someone to hold me. Not judge or offer advice, but just hold me crying and close to their chest like a child. Because that's what I&nbsp;feel like. My god, is this how I'm going to end this? Yep."

Speaking of avoiding certain people: here's just one example of a guy I&nbsp;have been trying to hang out with for a while (who I've known for years) who is kind of an unsure of himself, unresponsive, and a passive-aggressive dick in all respects lately , but this was the last straw.

Me: &quot;Yeah, I'm going to try to get into Munsen because it will look really great on my resume, and I&nbsp;don't care what I&nbsp;do to start out.&quot;
Him:&nbsp; &quot;Pshhhh, yeah right. That place is impossible to get into.&quot;
Me: &quot;Well, I'll just have to be persistent with my applying.&quot; 
To end the conversation, he says this in a sarcastic, taunting tone. I&nbsp;can almost see him smirking on the other end of the line.
Him: &quot; Let me know when you get into Munsen.

Seriously, you can dismiss me, lie to me, use me (or so it seems I'll tolerate it to a certain degree)...whatever, BUT&nbsp;DON'T&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;EVER&nbsp;TELL&nbsp;ME&nbsp;I&nbsp;CAN'T&nbsp;DO&nbsp;SOMETHING.

I&nbsp;think people like this are already dead inside and are unneccessarily occupying space on earth because they have failed so many times in everything.

All my other classes suffered because I&nbsp;procrastinated on this paper that is worth 20%&nbsp;of my sociology grade. I&nbsp;actually didn't procrastinate as much as it seems because I&nbsp;actually thought it was due Thursday. I&nbsp;didn't find out it was due today until a couple of days ago. I&nbsp;missed all my classes today, and now I&nbsp;will be behind. Things are not going well. I'm pissed that I am doing not great in classes, I&nbsp;can't support myself off of the hours I&nbsp;am getting at work, that I've been eating like crap and not working out, and that I&nbsp;don't know what's going on w/ Danny and I&nbsp;and why he is so unresponsive lately. That's the kicker and I&nbsp;think I am letting it effect all the shit I&nbsp;just mentioned. I've never been in a relationship this serious, and I&nbsp;feel myself spiraling at it's (seeming)&nbsp;demise. Like I&nbsp;said, I&nbsp;haven't been able to get him to communicate, so I&nbsp;have no idea what is going on. Putting this frankly, rejection sucks. 

K, I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;need to start getting up early and going to bed early to keep myself from waiting around for Dan. Maybe I&nbsp;won't be inclined to sit around and think of him. I&nbsp;need to stay busy and make myself feel beautiful I&nbsp;guess. I&nbsp;HATE getting up early, but I&nbsp;hate going crazy too, so it's kind of a toss up. Hmmmmm being tired and pissed of for insane? Eh.

So, I'll finish laundry tonight, dry it, and fold it. Then I'll go to bed.

10:30 go to post office and change address
11:00 cancel appointment for Thursday

It crossed my mind occasionally.&nbsp;In contrast Iremember being 16 and thinking, &quot;I&nbsp;can't wait to document this in my livejournal! (Yeah, I was one of the nerdy people)&quot; Wow maybe I&nbsp;was just more zestful when I&nbsp;was younger, and maybe this whole getting older thing is getting to me. Or maybe it's time for a new unegocentric (word?)&nbsp;focus on my lj? They didn't call it livediary for a reason. Ha!<br /><br />I&nbsp;don't neccessarily want to make tis a strictly political journal, though, that being the first subject that crossed my mind. And anyway, the political is so personal it would end up being about me anyway. I&nbsp;guess maybe i just used to think I was hot shit and so I&nbsp;wrote about everything, and now well, ugh adulthood and monotany kind of stifle my creative, manic side. mania is awesome, btw.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />AND, a lot of the people I found so interesting on lj, have neglected their vertual goldfish too. Like, right now, who am I really writing this to? Myself, well yeah, myself of course. Kim?&nbsp;Yeah, probably. Casey will most likely stumble upon this at some point. Maybe <lj user=""randomposting"">&nbsp;, but that's about all. There used to be Johnny, Evan, Pete, Cody, Eric,Ashley,sometimes my cousin Eli would make some anon comments to my lj's. Morgan too.&nbsp; There used to be my boyfriend too, until he started backing away from the online profile and journaling world. And he really has. He has a myspace but it is so keenly monitered by hin that you can't post anything. He doesn't really tell about himself at all. Sometimes I&nbsp;wonder what scared him away. He's closing up, and not the same person I met online four years ago. Or maybe he is just closing up to me. And now this entry turns into how much I miss him, and my confusion towards his dismissive behavior. I&nbsp;wish he would let me know what is going on, because I am always here to listen and love, even if it's not always sunshine and rose petals. I wish he still had a livejournal so I could at least know what's going on in his life. He's a wonderful person, so this&nbsp; is new to me. Perplexing. <br /><br />And occasionally, i can't help but blame myself for moving away. Maybe it was naive of me to think he would be okay with it, although he said he was. In some ways, Iam still a little hopeful girl. And, not completely changing the subject, AZ spunds wonderful right now. it's a brisk and windy 31 degrees F accompanied by an exilerating whirlwind of sleet. Ouch, my freezing,bone-cold fingers. It's cloudy to boot. The sunshine that is probably semi-intesne in AZ right now sounds delish. I&nbsp;kind of miss AZ. And the mountains. <br /><br />So my roommates and I took in Tara because she was kicked out of the Goodwill homeless shelter. She's a friend of Andrea's. I&nbsp;refuse to complain about her, though&nbsp; I am very tempted. We'll see how long I can refrain. She sleeps on our couch.<br /><br />Toodles!<br /><br /><br />"

I&nbsp;am very curious to follow what he does for this country, with our help of course, in the coming years. Mother Nature seems to feel it too, because the weather has been gorgeous yesterday and today. Here at least. Change in gov't; change in the seasons.

Time to bid Bush and Cheney fairwell, dig ourselves out, and clean up, guys. 

I&nbsp;believe the only way we will get the results we want is to stay informed and involved in what little ways we can. I&nbsp;am not saying Obama is going to fix everything, and there are some things I&nbsp;disagree with him on. There are just too many issues, too many problems, too many controversies, and a limited amount of time and currency. He is only one man and his cabinet.&nbsp; We have to actively participate too. All we can ask for is improvement, and with him I&nbsp;think we can all achieve that in our economics in generel, our social services, our foreign policy and relations, our environment,&nbsp; our national defense and homeland security agenda,&nbsp; and our futures as a whole.

Rambling. Soooooooooooo, I feel pretty good for three reasons: 1) I have intoxicants rushing through my bloodstream. 2) I&nbsp;got to harrass a bunch of my childhood neighbors, and 3) I&nbsp;totally have the H-O-T's for Barack Obama. I&nbsp;say that's pretty sufficient reason!

I spent the night driving my father around my area, mostly Lake Ann and Interlochen so we could gage some statistics for the Democratic Headquarters here in Beulah. We also reminded people to get out and Barack the vote, if indeed it did apply. 

OH&nbsp;NO&nbsp;MOMENT&nbsp;OF&nbsp;CLARITY *chugsssssssss*

It's amazing how politics seem to draw people together or create a crater of a divide. In this case, we mostly encountered strong or leaning democrats, so there wasn't too much negativity. Instead of feeling interrupted, most actually greeted us with smiles and exuberant expressions such as &quot;YEAH, I'm voting for Barack, and i can't wait!&quot; Obviosuly, it wasn't an accurate cross section of an average communtiy (since it was more about reinsurring the count of people w/ democratic voting histories and independents) but nonetheless, it was a fun experience. Tomorrow I&nbsp;will be harrassing people 100ft away from teh voting booths. God I love democracy."

I sincerely thought she was gone forever. I even thought she was probably dead because she's so small and timid, and she got loose in an area where she had never been before the first day she was in MI. As soon as I was at m y Aunt's house and I couldn't find her after a few hours, I knew in my heart she was gone. I mean, how could I find her if I lived 5 hours north of the area? They always tell you, go into the humane societies yourself because you can't rely on just calling. I figured even if she did survive the wooded area with lots of predators and highways, that she would be too timid to let someone catch her. But, I made 5 color copies of a really detailed reward poster w/ my aunt's number, hung them up in a vet clinic across the street, a local grocery store, a post office, a community center, and the EZ Mart gas station. After I got home, I called all the vet offices and humane societies w/ in a ten mile radius just to get their fax numbers. I faxed the poster into about 15 different places in case someone would come across it. I even put an add out on the local radio station and that ran for a week or so. I don't know how many times I called the Lenewee Count Humane Society...ugh. And they were usually really rude. But yesterday I got an email from my step mom saying that my aunt had called about a man finding Lorna! She is staying w/ my aunt and uncle until I can make it to Clinton, near Ann Arbor.

Apparently, Lorna was hanging around the EZ Mart gas station living off scraps of food and most likely garbage. I have not seen her yet, of course, but my aunt says she doesn't look malnourished. 

I'm really glad my work wasn't for nothing, and SUPREMELY UTTERLY ECSTATIC that Lorna is safe and sound, and THAT I HAVE HER BACK! I wonder if the poster would have gotten the man's attention if there weren't a huge reward sign in dark red print. Haha, anyway, I plan on thanking him rather generously for going through the effort. And my aunt and uncle have been more than cooperative. I'm SO happy!

"event","Back in MI. Pretty confused, and deadlines are past for school and such. I still have to sign up. Geeze. Tomorrow? Tomorrow. 

The apt is super small for the price. I feel a little ripped off. The whole place is over $1000 for what seems like a small room (the kitchen and ""living room"" combined) and three closets attached (the closets being the bedrooms), especialy mine. Mine could fit a queen sized bed...if that's literally all I wanted in my room, didn't want to open my closets or my door fully, and decided it would be cool to hop into my room on the bed (since there would be no extra room for walking into my room.) Also, the complex advertised a dining room. Where the fuck is the dining room area? Outside?

The paint is shitty and all scratched up from past movers. There are lots of stains on the carpets. The carpet is coming up at the seams because the maintainance is too lazy to put covers over the transition from the cheap-ass carpet to the cheap-ass linoleum in the bathrooms and kitchen. Two bathrooms sounds nice for three people, but the girl with the master bedroom pretty much owns it since it is connected to hers alone, and Charotty (sp?) and I have to share one that is only a little bit smaller than my room. This morning I had to pee so bad, but I had to wait for what seemed like hours for her to get ready for work in there. I don't blame her really, yet it sucks to feel like you're going to piss yourself for that long. I've never had my OWN bathroom or anything, yet I wasn't sharing it with a girl my own age either. 

Speaking or urine, The walls are so thin, you can hear people pissing in the upstairs apt. Well, no. But pretty darn close. 

If I had the power to price this place, I would say around $750-$800 /month would be tolerable given the use of the fitness center. It is so small, that even that is stretching it, though. Maybe the price is based on location. It is very close to the mall and other shopping plazas...NMC too. But shit, Dan's nephew could have done a more careful job building a replica out of play dough. I guess they were more concerned about the quantity of money they would be making sooner than later, and the lesser quantity of money they would be spending to throw these things up with quality taking a back seat. 

And the golf course they boasted? The area is a&nbsp; little bigger than a standard bath tub. WTF. I probably would not have chosen this place had I been able to see it first. Whatever. The selling point was the workout area. 

WHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

My cats are here, though. And they're doing well. They'd be doing better if they weren't in the window drawing attention of unknowing management, though. 

I don't really like it here, but I like the people for the most part, so I guess I'll settle. And I hate my room. What else is a girl to do?

"event","Today was my last day of work! I've been there for almost 2 years. Huh. I will miss some of the people though.
Tomorrow my father is signing MY lease. My name. With my signature. lol. 

""Mel, you have to swear it was you who signed it.""

Who am I going to tell? Oh, yeah. All of you on livejournal ;) 

This is kind of ironic because my dad is dead against me staying at the apartment of my choice because I am kind of getting ripped off. Plus, he thinks that a dorm would be good for me. He wants me to experience the ""real"" college life. What, dad, you mean like the ones in the movies? So many college students live off campus. And who's to say I won't have the opportunity to live in college housing communities again? For CHRISAKE, Danny is going to be experiencing the ""real"" college ideal here soon for his senior year! I am happy for him. He already emailed his roommate with a little prodding from me to introduce himselff, break the ice, and possibly find out about him. Still no word from Spencer Chamberlain. That's his cohabitant's name. It sounds kind of British. 

For the last few nights I've been feeling quite sorry for myself. I'll be missing Danny, and I know how painful distance can be, especially after living together. Also, the prospect of a non-existant sex life sucks. Lol, but not as much as just plain missing his company and his sweet face. But anyway, last night I was worrying so much about his impending absence (and of course my other endeavors) that I couldn't sleep. Suddenly a strange calm came over me. This calm was provoked by a very odd, out-of-the-blue thought.&nbsp; And it happened after hours of tossing and turning. I thought, ""If soldiers' wives/fiances/significant others can cope with absences of 1, 2, 3 or more years of distance and the heartache that accompanies it, I can surely deal."" Weird, huh? But there is truth to it. I do not have to wonder if Danny will be okay';I know he will be more than okay with new friends and&nbsp; a degree getting closer and close to those sweet palms of his. I know he will have cheaper health care through a school program. I know he will get to enjoy a new and very different setting than the city he says he despises. I can get through it because I have my friends and family. I have school (I will be doing more than full time to keep scholarship w/ Maricopa County and to meet more people and do hobby classes like pottery at Northwestern Community College) to keep me and my cycling mind occupied. Likewise, I'll have a job, but hopefully not too many hours. And as always, lol, I'll have my cats to comfort me at night, and some new roomies to hang out with. Hopefully they won't make fun of me too badly for liking The Real World. :) In addition to all of these comforts and distractions, I will try to see Danny as much as possible. I plan on seeing him three times just during the school year alone~October, winter break, and spring break (Woo, I'll be 21!) I wonder how I'll break it to my job(/s?)...I really don't care. I'll just quit them if they say I can't go. For once I can do this because the only expenses I have to worry about are my car insurance, gas, car loan, groceries, and cell phone bill ($300-$350/ month), and I can save that in advance. The rest comes from my student expenses fund. Then, Dan says he will come and stay with me during the summer. He may then fulfill his student teaching in MI. I truly, truly hope so. In reality, I'll&nbsp; be seeing him roughly every three months. He'll be absent a total of 9 or 10 months until May/June. Not bad. And knowing that I cannot control everything despite my plans for the next year, I can take solace in coping mechanisms I can control. If I feel extremely down, I will work out in the gym or sketch a bit. Or write in livejournal?

All that nonsense aside, I am very happy to (not) be signing that lease because it seems like an adventure. I can't wait to meet my roommates. They seem very nice. And school as well, will be nice to get back to!

"event","So, I'm going back to MI soon. In like 18 days or less ( I still have not purchased the plane ticket). Possibly 16 days. Hmmm, I've been here for so long. I don't neccessarily want to say I'm sad, it's just weird after being here for two years this past July. Maybe I am kinds sad. I'm really sad about leaving Danny. Really sad. I'm really anxious about putting in my two weeks (which I do today), cancelling SRP,&nbsp; moving all my stuff, selling the last of my school books and misc. stuff, getting the cats fixed (we have to make apts after the 11th to use the free vouchers we applied for) and scheduling separate dates for their check ups (which have to be within 10 days of takeoff to be valid documentation of their health), waiting for my dad to check on the apartment to make sure I'm not getting screwed by people on craigslist I dont know, signing a lease for said apartment, getting transcripts sent&nbsp; from South Mt. CC (where I have to go sell remaining books) to Northwest MI University to complete admissions, sign up for classes, and finally move all my stuff into a new place with new people. I have to run all the errands with no car. I also have to come up with all the money for this...bills for this month and cost&nbsp; of flying cats and cat exams and carriers ect HERE, rent for part of this month and next month THERE, and MY JOB IS CUTTING HOURS.

OKAY, SERIOUSLY I HAVE 4 FOUR-HOUR SHIFTS THIS WEEK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm not kidding. And last week was only a little better. Just a tad.

Time crunch for sure. And most of it is my falt. Trouble with my dad and step mom have caused my decision of what I am doing to change several times until I just decided I had to get my own place to not have to be in their company and deal with the drama recently. I have been looking on craigslist for months, but&nbsp; many will not take cats or are in BFE nowhere. I was exremely lucky to find this place, although I do pay the same amount for a smaller room. Oh, well...Also, it's hard choosing between friends/family and a lover (at least temporarily). But it doesn't help that I have like 7 days to get my cats fixed and get health documentation because the vouchers don't work until the 11th of this month. God..........

On another note, I probably have to fly out of Albuquerque or possibly Santa Fe to avoid temperatures above 85 degreessF so the cats can fly safely. There are SO MANY regulations for pets, which is good because it's not okay to put them in physical harm like that just for convenience, yet it is mind-numbingly frustrating to figure out how to deal with them, especially with the unavoidable time crunch and the climate Dan and I live in. Summer in Phoenix???? 115 degrees F. 

So my problem really? I guess that would be the cats. Sometimes i wonder why am making all of these obviously unhelpful sacrifices just to keep 3 of my cats (two with me, one with my wonderfully supportive Grandma).&nbsp; I love them, and I am scared of them being put to sleep. They are average and they are def. not cute little baby kittens. Plus I am attached. That I cannot lie about. Is it worth it, though? The decision has alienated me from my family a lot. ""Why is she bringing all of her cats? She's fucking crazy!"" 

Needless to say, the decision is the moral one, I believe; the one I feel is right in my heart. Yet, it has succeeded in making me feel ashamed of myself in my family's eyes. I can tell myself they don't understand, that they didn't&nbsp; move all the way out here to work to pay bills, not have a car, and go to school and not have time for friends, let alone making new good ones, and have a lot of miserable experiences (on top of good ones, of course), only to have 4 cats steal their hearts and offer them comfort. This still doesn't make me feel any less crazy and unrealistic. It's weird to be so divided. And it is regretful that I have to give up Abigail. When I look at her i just want to cry. I think it's the uncertainty of her future that bothers me. I can;t find a home that wants her for various reasons, and honestly I feel bad about dropping her at a shelter like so many clothes at goodwill. Sorry Abigail, it was fun while we had you, but I'm gonna recycle you now...*shudders* I feel like a bad person; doing that to someone I love. DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDX I try not to even think about it, but I know I will after the fact. Poor Abigail.

So tonight more packing is in store, and tomorrow I go to SMCC and request the transcripts and sell what books I can. I also need to make an appointment on the 10th and 11th for health check ups. I will also call tomorrow about that. Then, I will have my dad purchase I ticket out of ABQ, and the rest will fall into place with hard work. 

Ar worst? Cats don't get fixed, I sign up for late or online classes, and a lot of my stuff goes into storage until I have the $ have Danny send it to my pat in MI. The lease, the health inspections, and the ticket out of ABQ are my top priorities."

"event","Gosh, I know it's been a while, and I just had to post. 

4th of July and the 4th of July weekend was super for me! I got out early from work on Friday. Dan did too since the mall closed early that day :D
Danny and I knew his mom was not doing anything except watching Liam, Dan's nephew, and that they were staying in while Amy went out. We felt bad, so we had offered the night before to come by and cook for them in addition to taking Liam to see his first fireworks display. I was very excited to do this by the way, since I think Liam is just peachy! lol, peachy. What I mean to say, is that I have a baby crush on Liam. Everything he does (and fortunately does not do at least while I'm around) makes me smile. He's completely adorable!

Anyway, so we followed up on our promise and BBQ'd, ate dinner, and drove to the fireworks. We got a late start so we did not get into the stadium. We sat in the Target parking lot among many other families, and popped a squat on the pavement which was still hot from the days searing hot sun. I sat between Danny's legs and Liam sat between Joleen's. Danny bought me a orange Sparks alcoholic drink, and he presented it to me there in the lot. Yum! I didn't care about our location, on the contrary it sort of added to the excitement- like the scrambling anticipation.&nbsp; I hadn't seen the fireworks the year before, and so I welcomed the experience with delight and the happiness of the family togetherness. Liam, on the other hand, was scared shitless- only for the first 10 minutes though. Then he started clapping and pointing!! And the fireworks were great by the way. SO mesmerizing behing the neon Target sign. lol.

And then we dropped Liam and Dan's mom off at their house after fighting some traffic back, and took the car. We grabbed a banana split, and headed home to end a wonderful night. But the weekend had just begun. The next morning we spuratically threw some stuff in a bag to spend the night near the Grand Canyon. Road trip! It took us a while to get there. Thankfully, Danny burned some cd's entitled ""Grand Canyon Mix"" to get us through the drive. He's so thoughtful like that. 

So, we got to the toll booth, paid the $25 fee, and got a map and a 1-car pass in return. Even the drive to the canyon was enticing. There were small portions along the way. The first stop was the one with the watchtower. The watchtower was totally ignored. Immediately Dan and I decided we wanted to hike down the canyon a ways to get a better view of the Colorado River that runs through it. We hiked down so far we could no longer here the massive crowd of people along the edge fences of the canyon at all- just complete silence except for some wind and Dan's steps in front of me. The view? GORGEOUS. Nothing like it. I just sat soaking it all in from all angles, dangling my legs over the side, my camera clicking away. I could have stayed looking at that hole in the ground all day. Someday, I want to hike all the way down and back. I want to camp and make a week long trip out of it. 

Anyway, we went to several points, hiking down and up several times. It was pretty tiring, but felt invigorating. I may want to take up climbing once I get smaller, since I believe there are weight limits. We left only when it started getting dark, and unfortunately, we missed the sunset over the canyon which I had planned on seeing. We hadn't eaten all day and I was feeling sick. Instead, we ate overpriced tourist food at the final point on the south end, Canyon Village. 

Then we drove to Flagstaff and slept in the car (because I'm cheap as fuck) only to wake up early and investigate Flagstaff and neighboring towns. I wanted to go back to the GC, but we didn't have enough gas money :( Oh well, I'll save it for another time.

On top of that, I had the next two days off after we got back! 

I'm very glad Dan and I got to do this before I have to leave back to MI. We took the initiative finally (with help from Dan's mom) to leave this shitty city for a while, and it payed off. I just didn't want to go home after Dan and I had talked of going to the GC, California, Mexico etc, and not have done anything. That would have been very disappointing. I have more faith now, in our plans for future travel endeavors. 

Soooooo...great bonding weekend for sure! &lt;3"

"event","Gah, summer is nice, but at the same time it makes me feel extremely lazy nd unproductive. For instance, I should be packing my stuff for MI, but I don't know where to start. Instead, I'm on the computer uploading fashion accessories to my pupe profile. http://pupe.jp/profile/zdQNP4GX9FXW/

Basically, you upload pictures of clothes, shoes, jewelry, and other trinkets and get a currency known as ribbons in return. Usually, you also get other items to dress your pupe (doll) up. You dress her up and show off how many ribbons you have to other members. It is sort of like networking, and you can make friends with other fashionistas and check out different name brands, but mainly, it's just shallow. AND extremely addicting. You view other real life closets of people who also have pupe profiles and you can comment for ribbons as well. Hmmm...Lately, I've been uploading things so much I feel like I'm doing inventory.

It's distracting in a good and bad way. I think I just don't want to think about all the things I have to do and mostly how bad I feel about leaving Danny here. I'm scared. I hope he doesn't feel like I am abandoning him. I don't really know how to explain it. Mind ramble and ramble and rambles. 

Will it work out?
Will he really come back to MI for me?
Am I ruining his trust in me by leaving?
Am I just giving up and should I just stick it out here in AZ?
Can my wallet handle MI's shitty economy? 
Do I even really like it there?
Why am I really going home besides family?
Have I really done all this just to risk giving him (and our cats) up?

I now it's only a year, but it's a very important decision. I'm going crazy and I'm running out of time."

I eat when I can, and it's most likely crap I didn't cook, and I don't make enough time for exercise.

What's the first thing to go when you readers are busy with work and/or school or equally time-consuming responsibilities?

I doubt anyone will answer that.

All I have left to do for the last week of school, is study my ass off for the biology exam, since I am on the brink of an A and a B, write about a few more solutions on my 7-page paper on the Darfur Genocide, turn in a couple late homeworks for English, and study for the English exam.

In summary.

Sunday and Monday: Study for biology.
Tuesday: Write Darfur paper between Bio and communications.
Wednesday: Study for English exam.
Thursday: Turn in paper, take English exam, and I'm done!!!!

SO yeah, anyway. I miss artistic stuff I used to submerge myself into like sketching or poetry. For a while a drew everything. I drew my friends, my pets, my foot when I had it in a cast after sliding into first base and breaking my ankle, myself, random objects. Of course, I always had to look at the object to draw it, but I played up on the shadows. I was never one of those innate drawers who could draw from memory. I miss singing. I used to take voice lessons. I miss my piercing; they reminded me how impulsive I could be. Retarded looking or not (lip ring I got at 16, I'm talking to you). I feel free when I am impulsive because I am not restrained by anything, especially myself. I produced my own energy, void from the external presences. That's when I'm at my happiest.

Last week, I tried to recapture that brief feeling of freedom. I had some hot-pink hair dye sitting around from when I died my hair different colors every few weeks (like 2005). Of course, my hair was too dark to let it show up, but I didn't want to bleach it. I thought it would show a little, but not even a pink tint emerged. It was too light. Almost bubble-gum pink. I was tempted to eat it, but I refrained.

I think you can nurture spirituality through creativity and vice versa.

ANd like this quiz says, I am spiritual; I just hate organized religion. Organized religion stints creativity too! DO this, do that, and you'll be fine...NO, that's not what spirituality is about. Ignore the rules, do what feels right, and find it within. Spirituality should be about going within yourself and finding that creativity and that positivity. Spirituality lets you realize you are the all-powerful being, not some guy up in the clouds with a beard who smells like mothballs. 

ECK.

WHY IS NONE OF THIS RELEVANT WHEN YOU GROW UP?????? Maybe that's why I've been so crushed lately (for the last 2 years). No time for spirituality, 'cuz that doesn't get you anywhere in the career-driven world. Balls, and the need to be different don't get you anywhere in the world unless your innovative with stocks and bonds or come up with a new company logo. Fuck that. That's not creativity, because it's not spirituality and self expression.

K I'M GONNA GO BACK TO MY SHEEP AND HERD POSITION AT FRYS NOW WHERE THEY DON'T LISTEN TO A WORD OR CONCERN I SAY AND PAY ME IN PRETZEL STICKS.

Really. They even choose the cheep Fry's brand of pretzels. They're all bland. They could at least pay me in Rold Gold.  

And yes, sarcasm gets me through the day now that corporate consumers and society in general, who have no need for such silliness, have stomped on my spirituality."

"event","I feel incredibly apathetic today. I am supposed to be completing most of the things I listed late last night. It's almost 7pm, and all I've done today is wake up late, eat a shitty meal at Mcdonald's, and get a money order from Circle K to do laundry. Have I done laundry?? No. I get so mad sometimes that I have literally no days where I can feel comfortable doing nothing. It's always worry this worry that with school, work, and managing the household and all. I just want a day to blow; a day all to myself instead of having to feel guilty for being irresponsible once and a while. Can't a person live a little now and then? No, not without adverse consequences. Shit man, anyway, I'm still doing nothing knowing it's going to bite me in the ass later (like tomorrow). Now I'm just watching the Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys. I love this movie. The filming is perfect, and the story pretty damn good as well. Nice soundtrack too.

In fact, this is a movie Danny brought to MI for the first time EVER that I met him in person. He also brought the Lion King and we pretended to watch it in my room while we cuddled and become enthralled by each other's physical presence. I kind of miss that, you know. The way you feel when things are new. First-time experiences. 

That's the thing about online relationships. You experience the person (hopefully the real person) first, and the physical body second. It's almost mind-numbingly surreal; forming a strong bond before even laying eyes on a person and soaking them in or touching their hair and skin. It's great, but I would think that, normally, it probably doesn't end (or continue) the way that Danny's and my relationship has. It's been pretty good. Our relationship: awesome, but sometimes the circumstances in which we live are a little iffy and drag us down a bit. Regardless,&nbsp; I've never met anyone who understands me on the level he does, nor a person who even wants to.  He gets my humor, and not many do, and he laughs at random things I say when others would just roll their eyes. He warmly explains things to me that I should know and does not judge me. He even smiles bemusedly at my ignorances to make me feel more comfortable. He cooks for me, seeks my approval and my advice. He cherishes me, and it is visible. We are so comfortable with each other, we smile while doing nothing together: sitting at a restaurant, going for a walk, watching a movie. 

The apartment seems dingier, smaller, and more lonely without Danny here. Even with the cats, although they do help. I still look forward to him coming home from work so we can do nothing. Absolutely nothing. Together. Maybe apathy isn't so bad, as long as you have someone special to share it with.

Still, maybe some coffee would make me feel up to the task??? I can always be apathetic later. hrrrrrrrrrrrruuuumph."

"event","What do I pay...hmmm...let's see. I pay half the rent at&nbsp;$334.
Of course, then there's the&nbsp;water fee................................$7.
Then there's cable&nbsp; tv, phone, cell, internet......................$130.
energy......................................................................................$40.

so, since I am keeping the cell plan with Qwest, and it goes up to $30/m for me instead of $20 without the bundle (oh nosss), I basically need to find a place that is $480/ m or less to live at the same comfort level. I might have to take a pay cut, though at a new job. But I could do it."

"event","Ironically, today at work when I was reading a trashy magazine about a celebrity breakup, I found a worthwhile article directing me to <a href=""http://freerice.com/index.php"">this.</a><br />Expand your mind, and the tummies of some less fortunate individuals through the! It's kind of sad that it has to come down to a harmless gimmick like this in order to gain some attention, but that is no beef on the organization; it's great. And by gimmick, I don't mean anyone is being conned out of anything valuable; just their apathy. Basically, you are given a word for which you will pick a definition. It's multiple choice and adapts to your vocabulary level. Each word correctly defined earns 20 grains of rice through the United Nations World Hunger Program. It's non-profit and payed for by advertisements that you will see at the bottom of the screen on the site. <br /><br />I take that back. Only because the ""gimmick"" seems to be working. Maybe making world hunger into a game makes its demolition that much more attainable in a attention deficit disorder stricken, technology-oriented world. <br /><br />I really need to look into some community service. Something at least. <br /><br />"

"event","mmmkay, I'm getting sick and fucking tired of scrolling through posts two weeks old. SOMEONE needs to update already! You're probably thinking, ""Then why don't YOU fucking update""??!??&nbsp; I am, Bitches!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Plus,&nbsp; you try finding something meaningful to type when all you do is work, go to school, and bitch about the two!!!! 

Anyway, good news for D, though. He gets a full ride to NAU with a combination of grants and federal loans. He'll most likely be going this coming fall...which leaves me...where??? I Dunno. I'm ecstatic&nbsp; about it, though, because I love it when he's happy. 

I love reading. I do it on my breaks at work now, and people think I'm antisocial. Maybe I am. Or maybe these fictional characters are emphatically more interesting than their company. What are we really going to talk about? Oh jeez, Jerry, how's the bananas? Hey, Bill, you mop up any puke today? Sharon, I know you are old an arthritic and should be retired when Fry's overworks and underpays you, but how are you? Clay, how many hours have you spent on the computer lately and did you make time to shower? Tracie, how many guys did you show your tits to today without following through and how's the herpes medication working for you? What's the store scandal now Kathleen? I mean, I'm not really great friends with anyone in my department because, quite frankly all of them are dumb, old, boring, overly showy whorish,gossipy (IN A GROCERY STORE NOT HIGHSCHOOL ,OKAY),two-faced, crazy, or delusional. I'm just going to come out and say this: I think the majority of people who work where I work and are over 25 are losers. The woman go around spreading rumors and trying to catch innocent customers with tatoos stealing alcohol. Everyone talks about everyone. If I have a tiff with someone in the deli department, cashiers know about it the next day. GET A LIFE. WHY DO YOU OLD HENS WANT TO RETIRE AT FRYS??? All of you are obviously bored with the job or you wouldn't be so petty. God. I work with children. Or are my standards too high?? This is EXACLTY why I cannot hold a educationleess job and be sane. I need to talk to people with enough cojones to venture beyond Fry's; people who have real opinions about real things; people who push themselves. It's totally and utterly depressing for me to see so many people unhappy there with their lives and not do anything about it. STUPID STUPID STUPID.

Ugh, Kensie should be having her babayyyyyy pretty soon, or maybe she already has, or maybe she is in labor now for that matter. I'm excited to have an addition to the family anyway. His name will be (or is?) Kyle Preston Vincent! The first thing I thought was what a white name. So white. IS that weird?&nbsp; 

I've been choking down the spinach like so many hookers chocking down dicks. I don't love it too much, it's okay, but I eat it because it's so good for me. It's all waxy and rich. I like it with shrimp or tofu, though. Broccoli is a must.

 
Wow, okay, so that's my entry. I'm tired and I have to get up early for school tomorrow. Final exams and all. ew."

"event","I LOVE Sixteen Candles. That movie is uber classic, high school- inspired, chick-flick romantic comedy extraordinare! In me inspired desire for sprawling out all comfy-like on a big couch in pajamas and akwardly attempting to painting my toenails. 

Yesterday on my trip to the Desert Museum in Tucson, Liz said something pretty shocking. ""I miss high school. I loved it."" I wish I had that kind of recollect. I kind of laughed and she said ""What? Don't you miss it."" I thought about it and responded, ""No, but I wish I could go back and do things differently.""

How does someone look back on things that most others don't with a smile?&nbsp; I think it's about living in the moment, thinking about improvement and such, but not always living in the future or the past. You take more from the experience, and it's&nbsp; more apt to be a positive one that way. In high school, my mind was consumed with passed undesirable social experiences creating anxiety and resentment, experimentation with the ""right"" personality, and later on into my high school days, adjusting to s strange household and family and the infamous Danny Crockett, the man I wanted a future with so desperatley that he consumed my thoughts and my time to the point where it was a detriment to social networking and activities I would have otherwise participated in. I always thought I was wiser that most, but epiphanies like that just enumerate to the fact that&nbsp; maybe I've got a lot to learn about social psychology and self-improvement. 

Just a thought.

...........................................

Anyway, my trip to Desert Museum was awesome. I had fun with Jay, Liz, and Priscilla venturing about the desert looking at wild animals. I mean, I guess it could be compared to the zoo, but the habitat is extensively larger and in their natural habitat of the desert. I generally don't like zoos, just because they are dirty and the animals don't have very much room. Also, their habitats are extremely fake. Also, it's not just about entertainment; the caretakers have the animals' best interest in mind and there is much more to learn. They know a lot about the animals and conservation too. I want to go back. Tucson was sweet.

and...back to the movie."

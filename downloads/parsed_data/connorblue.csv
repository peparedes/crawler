"event","So after babysitting my niece all day for my sister while she was at work-she started at 5AM btw, she decides that she is going to go out to lunch with her new love interest and not let me know when I had plans of my own!  Isn't that super nice of her?  I thought so! 

Then, she gets pissed off at me for not being understanding.  I'm not understanding?  I was watching your daughter all day because you asked me to!  Yet you were inconsiderate enough to leave me in the dark so you could selfishly run off and do whatever the hell you wanted to instead of taking care of your responsibilities!!  

I'm so ANGRY! GRRR!!! =/"

"event","Summer has gone by incredibly fast!  It started off slow and then all of a sudden it is over.  I'm not very happy about that. 

I've been catching up on all of the shows I've been slacking on.  I rewatched the last season of Supernatural because no matter what I do I cannot get enough of that show EVER!  I have been watching Dexter.  Hmm I need to watch Undeclared and Justified still.  Timothy Olyphant can never be bad in my book!  I need to buy the second season of Deadwood and watch that also!  I can't wait for the new Supernatural season to start and BONES omg Bones! I'm super stoked for that.  As well as for both of those to come out on DVD.  

Lets see I'm trying to catch up on reading my fanfics.  I've caught up on most of my Sam/Gabriel ones, but my Destiel flist is still heavily in need of some hardcore reading.  

I also need to make a Barnes and Noble run for some new books and what not.  Gosh so much to do!  

Anyways I am going to try to update this a lot more often since I am horrible about it.  =["

I had calmed down for a while, but now I'm definitely back into it hahaha. 

I can't wait until the new episode OMG!! i'm so excited! 

Not to mention I'm addicted to destiel =D o_O ahhh I can't get enough.  

Alright off to try and do something productive...maybe...or maybe I will just find some good fanfic to read... Anyone have any suggestions? <3"

"event","Sometimes I wonder about people.  If you know you are doing something wrong why would you still do it?  If you know you are hurting someone, that should be reason enough for you to stop doing it, especially if it was a person you liked in any way.  

I'm not sure if showing remorse for it later is enough.  Yes, that shows you thought about it after the fact and realized that what you did was wrong and maybe you shoudn't have done it. Yet, you knew you were hurting someone the whole time and didn't do anything to fix the situation until it was over and done with and you had nothing else to do except sit there and see in retrospect what you had done.  Is it a last ditch attempt to save your conscience or is it true remorse for your previous actions?  Either way, you waited until the situation was over and you couldn't change anything anymore.

I would like to think I would never do something like that to someone. I know I'm a good person, maybe too good in other people's opinions.  I put other people in front of myself almost always. I find it genuinely hard to enjoy myself if one of my friends isn't and I can't stand it if I can't help someone if they need it or I can't fix a situation or relationship that is messed up.  I know some situations are out of my control.  

This whole situation has pretty much been out of my control.  I've tried to solve it from the beginning, but it seems like no one else cared.  Maybe I just care too much.  I don't like to feel like I have given up on someone, I have never just written someone off before.  In a way that's exactly how I feel, but when ""whatever"" is your only response to something then you clearly are not worth all of the effort I have put in.  Do you think that makes you a stronger person?  The fact that you just cut people out of your life?  I think it makes you weaker.  A coward.  You can't deal with something you run away.  You feel guilty and blame other people for things you can't take responsibility for.  That doesn't make you a man, that makes you an adolescent.  It all could have been easily solved if you would have taken two seconds, but you couldn't see it through al the fog of gossip that you kept seeing.  Your choice.

I would have hoped this wouldn't have affected so many people, but in the end i know it did.  I'm not sure I will forgive myself for some of the friendships that got ruined because of this. 

My heart was hurt, but now i know it will get better because I'm over it and am moving on."

"event","The past two days have not been much fun for me. 
Umm Wednesday night I got in a lame argument I guess you could say with my best guy friend over a girl he didn't know calling him on the phone.  If someone you don't know randomly calls you and you didn't give them your number I think that's weird.  I told him so and he got all pissy about it.  
When your best friend tells you ""I don't know what to say"" it is a little akward.  I'm not sure you should ever not know what to say to your best friend.  Am I right? 
Maybe I hold them to high on a pedestool....

Then after not talking all day Thursday-we talk everyday usually-he got mad at me again today over the DUMBEST thing ever!  He has these hats that he always wears.  Well, today I stole it and was just kinda wandering around with it talking to some people we know away from him on the other side of the room.  I walk back over to him and the group I was with before and I find out he is absolutely fuming over the fact that I had his hat.  He had been ranting to another one of our friends about it.  Yet, this whole time he never once asked me for the hat back or said anything to me about it seriously or jokingly.  I gave it back and he hasn't said anything to me the rest of the day yet.  Now, that has only been 3 hours and I am going to his soccer game in 20  minutes, but we'll see.  I just find it strange...  

These last 3 days or so have just been strange to me...our relationship seems off for some reason.  Maybe we need to take a break from each other or something.

I dunno...I just feel really lost.

Edit:
I have now gone to the game and come back and I am royally pissed.  So I go sit through his 2 hour game in cold ass weather with cold wind blowing to watch him play because no matter what has happened he is still my best friend and I am going to support him.  So all that and what happens after?  Absolutely nothing.  He walks up says ""who are you talking to"" and walks away?  What the hell is that?!  Are you kidding me?!!"

Gosh I feel like it took forever, even though I know it was only 5 months.  
Now I get to look forward to my 6 weeks-count them SIX weeks-off to do absolutely nothing except work and sleep.  
That's my plan.  
Well, and hang out with friends of course, but that's easy. 
So, this will be the first weekend in 5 months that I have had absolutely nothing school related to get done.  AWESOME! 

OK, I'm done with that haha.  If you want to check out the song Let's Pretend by MC Magic.  I can't find lyrics anywhere, but I really like the song."

Supernatural:  LOL her MySpace address.  ""Whats is that?  Some kind of porn site?""  Oh how i <3 him!  Oh wow, when the doctor lady got her leg all cut up I was like...gross.  I also adored the little Guitar Hero challege between Jared and Justin (Was that his name) from Smallville.  That was great.  

That was just freaky when the people they see start like changing or they think they are changing.  I really liked that guys paintings!  I would seriously buy someones paintings if they looked like that and they were for a reasonable price.  

I loved Sammy's little step into the circle!  So cute!    He has the best facial expressions.  I love his little conversation with Sammy about his suspicions that Papa Winchester made a deal.  Then, Dean got his theory confirmed of course, his dad did make a deal,but we knew that.  

Ahhh what was she going to tell Dean before whatever made her leave?  Holy cow I hate when that happens!  Poor Dean, I don't think I could live with that either...

WHAT THE HELL?! How are we supposed to wait a week to watch that episode?  Oh man!  IT looks so crazy good, it's not even funny! AHH!

"event","Alright here are my episode commentaries/opinions for the night.  There are definitely SPOILERS ahead: 

<lj-cut text=""Prison Break"">
Prison Break:  OK so Prison Break was the first show up.  CRAZY! Ok the whole Sarah being interogated/tortured by Kellerman....totaly waiting for someone to write the crazy darkfic about that shifting to a love affair or something.  

I LOVE LINCOLN! I definitely do!  I have always liked Dominic Purcell, but I really like Lincoln.  The way he acts with LJ his son and with Michael, I just love him.  

I totally called it when Sucre showed up to save Michael!  I was like nope it's going to be Sucre, then in he walked! Pwned. 

The preview for next week looks nuts.  How does Lincoln know it's his dad, but Michael thinks it isn't?  That doesn't make sense.  Very scary....
</lj-cut> 

Sidenote- Justice was cancelled?  Whats up with that?  I loved that show.  Kerr Smith is hot!

<lj-cut text=""Heroes"">
Heroes:  OK, Heroes was pretty good this week.  I think I liked last week's episode better, but still not too shabby.  The prisoner and Matt have the same tattoo.  They must have gotten them when they were both taken by Claire's dad.  I think?  Yea?  

My favorite characters I think are hmmm Peter, Isaac, and DL maybe.  Claire is interesting too, but I don't know how that whole situation is going to play out.  Are they going to save her in time?  Of course they will.  Have I mentioned that the whole eyes going white when they paint the future thing is awesome?  I don't know why I find that so kool...kind of like their eyes goign all black in the COvenant...definitely neat.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Studio 60"">
Studio 60:  Not a bad episode, but once again I think I liked last week's episode better.  I loved when Jeter stood up for Harry and accidently pushed the gay guy over the bush.  SO cute!  I love Danny too.  I don't really know why I just do.  

I'm kind of getting fed up with the Harry/Matt angsty drama stuff going on.  I'm hoping that is done with.  All in all a good episode.  The judge made me laugh and when the deputy ""lost"" the evidence bag I was definitely laughing! 
</lj-cut>

Well, I'm off to bed.  Be prepared for more episode commentary blogs thing-a-ma-bobbers in the future now that I'm obsessed with LiveJournal hehe."

"event","OK so I've slowly been passing the time since 5 because I am super bored.  I suppose I could do some of my reading or start on some of my school work that is actually going to be due within the next couple of weeks, but why would I want to do that?

None of my shows come on until 8 and that isn't for more than 2 more hours! Ugh I guess I am off to find something to do.  Here is my TV Schedule for the night:  Prison break at 8, Heroes at 9, and Studio 60 at 10.  Should be nice once it finally reaches 8pm!!

I think I am going to start blogging here more because I am becoming more and more addicted to livejournal it seems.  I used to just use it to read Fanfic and whatnot because I'm in a bunch of communities, but I think I'm going to start blogging here rather than Xanga.  I don't really use that much either so I'm just going to delete it.  On a side note, none of my friends in real life actually have livejournal so I'm going to have to make lots of new friends on here!  So if anyone from any of my comms or anything wants a new buddy to chat with on here let me know, I'm completely open to it!

  I just got to Arkansas after three days in the car with my parents and 2 bickering brothers next to me.  Joy.  I wouldn't really call it my ideal vacation, but hey at least I am out of my house.  Then again I like my house and my set up.  Oh well.  

The family reunion is tomorrow.  I think it will hopefully be good for my dad to see all the family he hasn't been able to for so long.  he will also have a chance to show off his four children I suppose haha.  Me being one of them.  

We head for home next Wednesday.  So I should be back home by Friday or Saturday at the very latest.  Then it is back to my routine.  i like my routine.  I think I may have a bit of OCD.  Just a tiny bit, but oh well.  

Leave me a comment if you need to get in touch!  Talk to you all soon!"

  i think i have grown out of my xanga.  plus too many people read it and i don't really like not being able to write what i really think.  so i think i shall transfer i all to here.  plus i think i just like livejournal better.  the communities are so much better.  i have been reading fan fictions after fan fictions for days now and i can't get enough.  i love it.  plus there are a million different communities i can join and feel welcome.  i love it!  i want to find a good SGA layout somewhere though.  Anyone know where I can find one?  any help would be appreciated and I want to find a good Major Lorne, Ronon, or SHeppard icon.  K I'm off on the hunt now! yay!

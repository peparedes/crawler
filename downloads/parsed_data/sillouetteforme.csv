"event","Ok first time being home since 6:40 A.M of friday. So just by what i said it was a good weekend. This is going to be long i think, sorry. 

Friday-After school and didnt end until 9 (smoking hours).
Ryan, Billy, Colin, and I were smoking at the fence so me and ryan smoked a bowl to ourselves cause it was our weed. A cop drives up the black path. He stops starts talking to us, then he says empty your pockets. Ryan has 2gs in his hand that cop doesnt notice the whole time as he searchs Ryan. The he searchs me finds nothing, But just before he gets to billy he gets another call that kids were running from the skatepark. If he searched billys bag we would have been fucked. 1g, a bowl, and it smells like straight up weed. So we really lucked out.

Saturday-We just smoked, but i was on the edge of passing out, really fun day and night.

Sunday-Band practice.

I still have a shit load of homework but i lost my bag with it all in it, so im fucked. Im gone for now, farewell meat lovers!!!<3"

A list of reasons why you left me
Out here on my own free will
Dont expect me to come running back to you 
With continuous apologizes

So just run way from here you really want to
Leave me out here on my own
No bothers to see if i am alive
No power to come back to you

In a hail of sparks you left me out with open wounds
I should thank you for the reasons i never stayed
But the one thing i never got was to be afraid of you

Im not waiting for your return
If you can find me you have every right to stay
But with a lost will and tamer who just doesnt quite
It will never work you dont know what to hit 

Your gone leaving me forever
I dont ever want you back
Nor to see your face again
Unless you give back my heart
Give back my heart to me

So just run way from here you really want to
Leave me out here on my own
No bothers to see if i am alive
No power to come back to you"

Words made in my head but dont quite reach the mouth to be said
Nothing is right nothing is wrong i dont know whats going on
But i dont care cause i got you in my arms

Help me out im feeling dizzy cant get my feet under me 
I keep stumbling over my words sorry for my shy instantses 
You dont know what to do with me, you dont know if im here for you
Or what am i doing i dont know that either 

So just sleeping in nothing the think about hoping awake next to you
Dont think less of it cause you know what i want cause all i want is to have you by my side
Watching over my every move just dont comment
Help me help me im loosing my head some loose screws all over the floor 

Dont sit there and act like you dont know me
Remember the days when we'd stare just for hours into our eyes
Hoping one would crack but nothing happened 
Instead of playing the game i got lost 

Help me out im feeling dizzy cant get my feet under me 
I keep stumbling over my words sorry for my shy instantses 
You dont know what to do with me, you dont know if im here for you
Or what am i doing i dont know that either  (3x)

No reasons to stay
Just hear for novelty purposes 
That help me pay for the human rat race

Working all night and working all day
At minimum wage 
So i can stay above the poverty line

Nothing is right with the world of tomorrow
Everything has gone out of my way
All i ever wanted and needed 
Is in one package i just have to pay

Walking away from the problems i once had
Just so they can come back to haunt me again
Some other day

Leaving my symptoms with other people now
Dont worry about it 
Just take it as a rain check

I'll come back to the day that you helped me here
To marvel the process 
That takes my problems away

Nothing is right with the world of tomorrow
Everything has gone out of my way
All i ever wanted and ever needed 
Is in one package i just have to pay

Nothing is simple
Nothing is right
Just an empty feeling
Try and sleep tonight

Leaving my symptoms with other people now
Dont worry about it 
Just take it as a rain check

I'll come back to the day that you helped me

And i have to get up everyday for the next 3 months at 6. But still its school i just want it over with, and the sooner the better. Im just not look forward to the homework. But its going to be really different cuase to many people, and im not a big talker unless you start a conversation, so troubles start there, and a lot of people just wont understand that i cant sit still so i have to move and make weird faces, Ms. Adams will understand that she had my brother.

Dont worry its not just you now
I just dont think i know how
Not to let you down 
When you think I've gone to far to stop before you found

What can i do 
To stop you from leaving me here
But its not like you really cared 
Cause you ripped my heart out and whipped it at the ground Were it lies.( C'mon C'mon)

I dont care what you say now
In my eyes you look so beautiful
Watching, waiting, looking for you when your gone to far to see
Now dont run away from me.

Just to find you i could walk the world in 80 days
Just to listening to what you have to say 
I know i wont, i know i cant, 
wait any longer now for you 

Just pull right away from me
And let me spread my brittle wings
Giving me room to leave you here
Feel so free and yet so bare

Help me soar above the rest to see
What it might not be like to be me
Things go by so fast they're just a blur
Sight gone so thin i nearly missed the point of why im here

Rather be dead then bruised or hurt
Cant find a reason to be here
Your slipping away into thin air
Want to grab you tonight and never let go

Words are tied verse for verse
My shaken love has been cursed
Feeling battered, shot and killed
Left me here with opens wounds to spill

Cuts and scrapes on my knees
Strike me down if you please
I'll come back so just wait for me

Trust me I'll help you up
Just heal my wounds and open cuts
Buts its all fighting tear for tear
When your gone and i am here

Time is lost and time is scarce
I'll take it in just to get pierced
The things i do i know I'll regret
Times like this i feel so desperate 

But past mistakes are in the past 
I'll clean the slate of broken glass,so make me start from scratch
With no markings on my back
And no deepth of when oyu look in my eyes.

Rather be dead then bruised or hurt
Cant find a reason to be here
Your slipping away into thin air
Want to grab you and hold you all night

Words are tied verse for verse
My untainted love has been cursed
Feeling battered, shot and killed
Left me here with opens wounds to spill"

Turn your back and walk away from me
You took my badge of pride now i cant see 
The pieces that are gone, the feelings that are there
Now you just left me alone and way to bare

Your coldness sent me up in a chill
Words so deadly that i think they might kill 
All feelings that are left, Cause im changing the rules
I got played like it was fucking April fools

Nothing said but everything is done
Me and you have nothing left so you shun
Upon the days that i left it all out there
Just letting you take everything i share

Went some many days with out saying i love you
I never had anytime to say or  choose
In between me and the wall of shame
You may have thought that you had me tamed

Days of dark and days of many light
All you did was really make me fight
The inner self between the things i did"

"event","Just let me die
Slow and away
Dont stop me
Its useless to stay

Not needed on land
No need for me 
Useless to most
So just let be

The touch of a saint
The heart which i need
So lie for good 
Dont let me go for now

Forgive all those who hate
Not only is it me
Just let me rollover and leave
Just to set me free

From these buckles and chains
Which hold back my wings
So let me fly away for you now
Soaring above, away and beyond

I've got the touch of a saint
A heart that i need
So let me free for good
Or just hold me down and bleed"

All my good friends move away, and it seems that nothing could get worse. Thats when i started just going for things. And i havent really looked back since. Lauren, Cody, Beth, Gage, and some others just helped me get out of that shit i was in. Thanks."

Gages car broke down at Mc D's which ended up being a good thing cause then he got off work so later that night i hung out with lauren, beth, gage, cody, adam, brian, and two other people i think. It was fun. Brain was doing the dumbist things so it was a great time. Then i spent like 3 hours with lauren cause everyone else left and i was to lazy to move, and i guess she was too. That was my weekend."

Dont look at me im in dinal
Times are hard but not the end
I'll take you with me to send

All my worries up in a roar
People stalking wont let me soar
Wings chained back so i cant fly
Let me be so i can die

Internal bleeding in my heart
Cuts that i dont know were to start
World of luck and worldof pain
Feelings driving me insane
Cant help you now your on your own
 
Let me fall and let me cry
Pick me up to say goodbye
Carry me away from here
A broke wing so i cant tear

Through the night sky
All you did was lie
So just let me be and you can find
Were you went wrong
 
Internal bleeding in my heart
Cuts that i dont know were to start
World of luck and world of pain 
Feeling driving me insane

I fall in and out of love
Your pushing, and then you shove
Thats the last time that i take these things from you


Internal bleeding in my heart
Cuts that i dont know were to start
World of luck and world of pain 
Feeling driving me insane"

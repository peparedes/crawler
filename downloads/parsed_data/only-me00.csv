"event","Divorce should be final Feb 21st. Got my nails done to pamper myself. I can't have them in the academy, but what the hell, they look nice for now. Whole day off to myself... Woot. Maybe I can catch up on some sleep. 
Had a great time on my ride along. The best one yet. Can't wait to get paid to do that. The first two were slow. First one- not many calls... second- got to witness what an intoxicated skitzo acts like, then ended up sitting at an accident scene for like 4 hours blocking traffic to make sure a power line didn't fall in the rd, b/c some drunk idiot snapped it in half and flipped his SUV. This one- was great. Here's the story- so male crack head A and male crack head B get into a lovers spat... then there's crack head C that is a neighbor that decides to sit on a car in the driveway and watch the goings on of crack heads A and B. Crack head A wasn't going to go to jail until the second time we were called to the same place, he decides to call the officer a ""dick head"". Then the cuffs appear. ""A"" then decides to be a huge baby and will not shut up... the right cuff is too tight, his wrists hurt, he just wants to go to bed, he wants a cigarette. He gets refused at the jail cause he has a cut. We sit at the hospital for 2 hours just so he can get some neosporin and a bandaid. Whilest at the hospital he will not hush, says that I'm an undercover agent and asks how long I've been watching his house. He also says that he thinks that he saw me in Playboy. Then asks if I and the officer I was with are sleeping with eachother and if we use the handcuffs. WTF? Don't do drugs... Drugs are bad.. m'kay. So I get home at 6:40 and sleep an hour then get up at 7:45 to get ready for work. It was worth it."

"event","Ok- so I'm curious by nature. I can't help it, and if I try to suppress it... It only makes it worse. I want to know why people do the things that they do, say what they do, act the way they do. Why is it that the more someone is needy or clingy, the more you don't want them? Why is it that you ""only want what you can't have""? Or, if you can have it you're too chicken shit to seize the day and go for it? 
With that being said, since the separation I have tried to make it a point to go after what I want. Those things that I was too scared to do before. Whether it was because I was scared of failing, or afraid that someone wouldn't agree with what I wanted to do- I didn't go after my dreams. You only get one shot at thsi life - right? I applied to LEX PD, I try to be a bit more blunt about what I want. I go where I want and do what I want to do. I am sick and tired of everyone looking over my shoulder and trying to put their nose in my business. It's my life- the last time I checked. I'm sailing this ship. If it capsizes- it's my fault. It's my mistake. I just want those certain individuals who think that they are co-captains in my life to back the fuck off. I'm not going to fail. The only way I will fail is if I don't get off the damn dock."

If you don't have musical talent, you've got a talent for picking out great CD's.

Music rules your life - and you've got the best MP3 collection of anyone you know.

Many guys find you intimidating, but a select few think you're the catch of a lifetime."

"event","My 4 year old says that he's Darth Vader... To everyone. He tells everyone that he's darth vader. From his teacher to the lady on the other end of the aisle in the grocery store- they all know that my son is Darth Vader. Not just that he's Darth Vader, but the whole story of Anakin Skywalker. How is it that this little person can remember the entire story line to all 6 movies- and still manages to miss the toilet when he goes potty? He can remember all the characters and the plots but can't remember where he left his shoes. About 6 months ago- he was the red power ranger, 6 months before that- spiderman, and before that he had a gig as Harry Potter. All I can do is hope that one day he will decide that ""Daniel"" is perfect in every way, and that's who he should be. In the meantime, I have to keep a stock of Star Wars fruit snacks, and star wars cereal- until the next alter-ego is chosen as a predecessor."

"event","So, I like the color pale pink, MP3's, Rock, I have two adorable little boys. I'm an ex drummer, I have a small tattoo on my right shoulder blade, my belly button is pierced, I want to be a police occifer... but what does anyone really know about me? What little bits of information do I know about my friends? I may know their birthday or favorite alcholic drink or some useless knowledge - but that doesn't mean that you really know them. Everyone only allows others to see the sides of them that they let show."

*looks around*

Because, seriously, I'm starting to think that even being a semi-murderer can't make this character more interesting for me.  =/

Plus, I've been thinking it over a lot in my head, and I'm starting to like the idea of reviving Mafalda.  All the other day I was thinking of entries I could write for her, and I think she'd be fun to play again.  I would change a few things from the Old Mafalda, of course, the things that didn't work last time.


I really need your input with this, guys.  =/


Thanks, I &hearts; you all like a fat kid &hearts;s cake with extra chocolate icing.

"event","Emmeline was worried.

<i>Something is definitely going on,</i>  She thought with a furrowed brow as she helped a Quidditch enthusiast pick out a racing broom for under thirty Galleons.  Staci hadn't returned, nor had she answered Emmeline's owl.  She still didn't know where her friend was, and it was worrying her.

""So are you going to take my money or not?""

""What?""  Emmeline said distractedly.  She blinked and looked down at the pigtailed girl standing expectantly at the register, clutching a broomstick.  The girl glared, holding out a handfull of Galleons and sickles.

""Oh-sorry,""  Emmeline apologized quickly, taking the money and handing the girl her correct change.  The pigtailed girl gave Emmeline another piercing glare, grabbing her money and counting it.

""You owe me five knuts,"" the girl said snottily.

""No, I don't,""  Emmeline replied, getting a little annoyed.  ""I gave you five knuts as your change.""

""But you were supposed to give me <i>ten</i> knuts!"" the pigtailed girl said shrilly.  ""I even <i>counted</i>!""

""No, I wasn't,""  Emmeline responded through gritted teeth.

""Yes, you were!""  The girl put her hands on her hips and gave Emmeline a bratty look, the broomstick falling to the floor.

""Fine, whatever,""  Emmeline said, frustrated, getting five knuts out of the register and handing them to the girl.  ""Happy?""

The pigtailed girl glared at Emmeline again before stomping out of the store huffily, carrying her broomstick with her.  She flung the door open right in another customer's face, who gave her a confused look before walking up to Emmeline.

Emmeline forced a smile.  ""How may I help you?"""

Do you think it would be alright if Clare/Timothy/Skye/Anna could have a fourth character?  (She asked me to ask you guys.  =D)  She's very good at keeping up even though she has a completely different time zone, and we <b>need</b> adult characters.

Please?


Do you think that some of you could either take up adult characters or get someone that would be interested in playing an adult character?

Because I'm not sure about what the rest of the adults think, but it's been getting kind of dull on the adult character front.

I suppose it's a lot my fault because I haven't been very creative with Emmeline, but there aren't very many people for her to RP with anyways.  =/  And it'd be very cool if we could get some more adult characters.


So...please consider my plea, and don't get angry at me for posting this.  It was just a small request and I'm not trying to FORCE you to take up an adult character, it would just be greatly appreciated.  =)

"event","Emmeline strolled into the pub, looking around at the chattering people and listening to the music.  A grubby-looking man was playing a piano that looked about two hundred years old, singing in a gruff but melodic voice.  She watched him for a moment, thinking.

Suddenly the man stopped playing and got up from the piano bench, pulling up his pants that had been slipping down his enormous backside.  He shouted something to the bartender and walked away from the piano, chuckling.

""I'll be back in a while...too many drinks, you know...""


Emmeline's mother had forced her to play piano when she was a young girl, and she had always hated it.  But now, as the piano sat there, the chair empty and full of opportunity, Emmeline had a strong desire to sit down and play.

She glanced over at the man.  He was heading over to the bathroom.  He would probably be in there a while, by the way he was clutching his stomach.

Emmeline looked back over at the piano.  She could almost hear a small voice calling to her, persuading her to take the chance.


Emmeline walked over to the piano and sat down, resting her fingers on the keys.  A pleasant shiver ran up her spine as she started to play, cautiously hitting the keys, trying to remember some songs she used to know.

A few heads turned to look at the newcomer who was playing.  They smiled and nodded their heads to the beat of the music.

""Sing!""  Emmeline heard a feminine voice call out.  She blushed, continuing to play, but didn't sing.  She was never really a singing person, but how would she explain that to all these people?

""Sing!  Come on, don't be shy!""  Several voices started calling out for her to sing, and some people started banging their goblets on the wooden tables, grinning and calling out.

""Sing!  Sing!""

""I'm not a singing person,"" she said with an embarrassed smile, but the customers continued to shout.

<i>Oh well...might as well make a fool of myself while I'm here...</i>


She took a deep breath, and began to sing the only song she knew the words to, playing along on the old piano.


<i>""I really can't stay - Baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away - Baby, it's cold out there
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry - Beautiful what you're hurry
And father will be pacing the floor - Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink more - put some records on while I pour...""</i>


It was completely the wrong song, especially since it was May and not December, but the customers seemed to like it anyways, by the way they were talking and nodding to the beat.

She grinned and sang with more emotion, knowing she sounded terrible but not really caring.  It was fun, and she was starting to love the attention, until...


<i>""STOP!  STOP!!  THAT'S MY PIANO YOU'RE PLAYING!""</i>


Emmeline jumped back, startled.  She turned and saw the large man running towards her, shouting, and her cheeks burned.

<i>""You dirty little b-""</i>


Before he could finish, Emmeline dashed out of the pub, determined never to do that again."

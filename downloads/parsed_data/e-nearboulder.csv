I can't believe it's been 9 months since Jon and I got married. Crazy how time flies. It's been great so far.

Jon and I had a wonderful wedding and are enjoying married life. It's hard to believe that it's been over a month already. 

I got a new job and start on 10/30. My last day at the credit union is on 10/26. It's somewhat bittersweet to be leaving a job after 6 years. I am really looking forward to starting a new chapter in my career. 

I had eye muscle surgery on Wednesday. It was a quick outpatient surgery. I am still recovering though. It's amazing how tired I get. It took a lot out of me.

I guess the extensive work that was done really took it out of me. Duh, I know. I am just getting cabin fever. First the doctor went endoscopically through my nose, but also had to make a small incision by my nose/eye socket area to correct the rest of the stuff. This whole surgery thing came about very quickly. I had my CT scan on Saturday, which is when the found they mucocele (the thing that was pushing my left eye down and out).  They figure the mucocele was an after effect of my car accident that I had when I was 16. It's been getting bigger over the years. At least it's taken car of. Once I heal up, I should be fine. I will have to get annual CT scans to make sure, but I figure that's better than my eye popping out."

Tonight I had homemade soft tacos with my mom, watched the aforementioned movie, put lotion on my dry feet, and buffed up my nails. Sometimes I am such a girl. I suppose that is normal. 

I went to Las Vegas over Columbus day weekend with a girlfriend from work. We had a good time. We did a lot of walking, hanging out by the pool, a little bit of drinking, a good amount of eating, shopping, and not much gambling. The highlight was Saturday night though. We went to the Palms to see if we could get into Rain and the Ghost Bar. The lines to get into both places were horribly long. Carly found this guy who looked important and asked him ""how does all this work?"". Basically he ended up being the right guy at the right time. He is a door host for all of the Palms clubs. He got us into the VIP line at both places. We went into Rain first. We got to go up in the VIP area, we had a bar up there with almost no lines. The dance floor was packed, but we had fun people watching. After we had our fill of Rain, we found mr. door host again and he hooked us up and got us into the Ghost Bar. This place is amazing. It has probably the best view of Vegas. It's small, and it's more of a lounge bar. It was very cool though. Sunday night we went to see Tom Jones in the Hollywood Theatre at the MGM Grand. For a 65 year old guy, he's still got a great voice and some great moves.

I also marvel at the fact that I used to be afraid of chick peas, hummus, and falafel. Now I love the last 2 very much. I actually crave them sometimes. I am so glad I am not the picky eater I used to be. 

I had a great birthday. JK took me out to dinner on Friday and we went to Le Central. We had reservations at Rioja for Saturday night. It was a cool place, good atmosphere, good service, excellent food. 

JK and I are going to Durango this coming weekend. He'll be meeting my dad for the first time. He'll be riding the Durango-Silverton train for the first time also. It will be a pretty quick trip, but it should be fun. I think JK will be asking for my dad's blessing to ask me to marry him. It's very sweet and a little old fashioned, but he feels it's the right thing to do. I am so in love with him. I know he's the one I want to grow old with."

I have this half plaster, half soft wrap thing on my wrist/arm until friday morning. I will also have my stitches removed then too. I will finally be able to take a shower without a plastic bag on my arm. :)

Saturday afternoon, I got to babysit for Jessika and Derek. Their girls, Claire and Ella, are too cute. It was only around 3.5 hours, but they were very good while mom and dad were out. JK helped because I have limited functionality with my arm. I changed one diaper and he changed the other. He was a great help. It was a good indication that he'll make a great dad someday. 

I love that JK and I talk about everything. Life, our dreams, hopes, inspirations, goals, wants, needs, and desires (to name a few). We have talked about marriage and kids too. We actually went engagement ring shopping this past weekend. He wanted to get an idea for what I would like in a ring that I will wear for the rest of my life. It's funny how my taste has changed since I actually have someone in my life that I want to grow old with. I thought I knew what I wanted in a ring when I wasn't in a relationship. The rings I love now are different than those I previously liked.

I raised $640 in donations. I got a tiny bit sunburned in places where I missed putting on sunscreen. My muscles are a bit sore, but it's an accomplished sore. I got to see some of the best mountain scenery in Colorado. I managed to ride 115 out of the 157 miles. I feel pretty good about that considering this is the first time I have attempted anything like this. I am definitely looking forward to my massage today.

We weren't even in the wedding party and they still kept us busy. After lots of drinking, partying and not sleeping over the weekend, we were ready for a vacation again. I caught the bouquet, JK caught the garter. Needless to say, we got some razzing after that. 

I am so happy. We are having so much fun together. I can really see spending the rest of my life with this man. I am so head-over-heels in love with him. He said something so very sweet to me. He said that what he wants and what he needs are finally the same thing, me. We talk about everything, we laugh, we keep each other entertained. We take care of each other, we motivate each other. It's a beautiful, fabulous thing. 

On a completely unrelated note: I think I am getting a cold. I hope not. I hate being sick, especially in the summer.

I am trying to get organized and figure out what to take with me for a 5 day trip to a wedding in Minnesota. I know what I am wearing to the wedding, that's easy. I have this really cute dress that I am wearing with fun strappy shoes. I know I will be in mid 80 degree weather with high humidity. I don't know how much formal stuff I will need. I think nice but casual stuff will probably be okay. I know I will end up taking more clothing than I need, but I want options. Are 10 outfits too many for 5 days? (No need to actually answer that.) Can I tell you how wonderful my boyfriend is? He bought my plane ticket for this trip we are taking to Minnesota. I have never had a boyfriend purchase a plane ticket or trip for me before.

It was boring, so we went to get a late dinner and then went back to his place. Before finally falling asleep, we had our overdue, important ""where do we stand, what do we want, what about sex"" talk. It went very well, I got clarification on everything that I needed to. Yay! Saturday after sleeping in a bit, we drove to Winter Park to ride the 3000 foot long alpine slide. It was a blast. We walked around town a little bit and had a late lunch before heading back to JK's place. We had a low key evening by just watching a movie and had a light dinner. Sunday afternoon I got to meet JK's family (for the first time) at a father's day celebration. I met his parents, brother and his family, sister and her family. It was a lot of fun. They were all very nice. They told him they liked me and that I am a ""keeper"". I am so happy. I really think this has great potential."

No worries until recently. I have no interest in him whatsoever. He and his wife have an open relationship. Lately he's been expressing interest in having sex with me. I told him I have no interest in that. I could never in a million years have sex with him (for a million reasons). It's just weird. A new situation for me. 

Things with JK and I are still going well. I am very happy. Saturday we went to the New Belgium brewery in Ft. Collins for a tour and a taste with a couple of his friends. It was fun. Sunday evening we met in downtown Denver for dinner and a movie. We went to see ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"". I enjoyed it, it made me laugh.

I got to take a training class through work today. It was day 1 of 2 in a course about crucial conversations. It's just interesting the timing of it. As I need to have a big important talk with JK. One I should have had with him a long time ago. We've been dating for 6 weeks now, and things are going quite well. I feel like I need a status report though. I would like to know where things are at, where they are going. We have a great time together, we talk about a lot of things. I am still enjoying getting to know him. 

Sometimes I feel like I don't know how to date. Or be in relationships. I have had quite a few. Most of them started with a physical relationship then progressed to the emotional. This seems to be new territory for me. Why am I so freaked out about getting to close to him? Why am I scared of screwing this up? Why am I being a chicken about talking to him about us?

I admire him for who he is, what he believes, and how he expresses himself. He really cares about everyone in his life. It's just great to see those qualities in someone. We are going on a road trip over Memorial Day weekend. Not sure exactly where we are going. Probably up to the mountains somewhere. At the end of June/early July we are going to Minnesota for one of his friends weddings. It should be fun. 

On a somewhat depressing note, my family and I just got my grandmother moved into an independent living apartment at the beginning of May. Turns out her dementia is more of an issue than we thought. They are making us move her out. We need to get her into an assisted living situation as soon as possible. A few problems, we haven't had enough time to get her set up with Medicaid. She owns so much stuff, which we'll now have to put most of it in storage. It's just really sad to watch her get worse every time I see her. At least her physical health is still pretty good."

I brought over a bottle of Spanish white wine, also yum. We talked a lot, ate, and watched the movie ""Spanglish"". Then the time warp hit, as it does when he and I are together. The next thing we knew it was 1 a.m. I had a 45+ minute drive, and therefore arrived home just before 2 a.m. My alarm went off at 6, and my cell phone alarm went off at 6:06 (as if 6 minutes really helps). I think I started to nod off for a second while staring at my computer screen after lunch. 

JK has a second degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do. I just get the sense that he'd kick ass for me if I needed him to.

I had a great time with jessindenver on Tuesday night. I treated us both to the Maroon 5 show. It was good fun. As much as I know it's not really very nice, it's sort of fun to make fun of people who have no concept of good fashion sense. (I know that everyone's definition of ""good"" varies.) But, seriously, what is up with the polo shirts with the collars up??? Even worse, the layered polo shirts with both collars up. 
I love the 80's really, but it's frickin' 2005. There were a lot of examples of this trend at the concert. Enough about that, it just made me laugh and shake my head in disbelief. I should probably get out more often. 

I took a personal day off of work on Wednesday and spent the day playing in Denver. I bought some cute new shoes. I had lunch with my good friend JM. I went to go visit another friend MM after lunch. That evening I had a great first date with JK. He's a friend of a friend whom I met about 5 years ago. He's smart, funny, charming, kind, and someone I find attractive. He works as an IT PM for a mortgage company. He has his own place, car and motorcycle. The one downside is that he lives on the other end of the world from me (talking about at least 45 miles and an hour or more drive time). Our date went from walking and taking to bowling a couple of games, laughing, eating dinner, walking and talking in the rain, shooting pool, sharing a bottle of wine, talking and laughing some more. We met up around 4:30 and next thing we knew, it was 11:30 p.m. We walked back to our cars holding hands. (I know, I am gushing.) It was a nice G rated date, with a nice PG kiss and hug at the end. I am seeing him again this weekend. Grin... I am trying to stay grounded about this. I am trying to have no expectations, as to not be disappointed later. I am just going to take it one date at a time and see what happens. I just wish I could contain my excitement.

He was a really good supervisor too. He had been with the organization for 9+ years. It just sucks. I saw him on Friday night for a sort of FAC/good bye thing. The first thing he asked me was how I was ""holding up"". He knows me too well. I can be a basket case sometimes. He is a trooper though, he stayed out with the party until 1:30 a.m. We went all over the place and had way too much to drink. (Well, I HAD WAY too much to drink.) Saturday morning at work was so very painful. I thought I might have to excuse myself from helping someone so I could go vomit. Fortunately, that feeling passed eventually. 

On a better note, I am really happy that MLS season is here again. I have season tickets for the Colorado Rapids. Their home opener was a tie. They were completely outplayed by FC Dallas. I still had fun, though."

Just annoying because I could feel it all day. I had a feeling I had an ear infection. Turns out I was correct. No, you don't have to be a brain surgeon. I went to the doctor, got scolded for using Q-tips, and was written an antibiotic prescription. I am mostly over my cold that lasted about 11 days. I will have about 48 hours of antibiotic overlap though. Fun stuff. 

While I was at the doctor's office, I had him check out my wrist. I thought my synovial cyst might have come back. I was right about that too. It's this little pocket of liquid that comes and goes as it pleases apparently. I had the same problem last year, and thought it was gone. Apparently the only way to really get rid of them is surgery. Of course, it is my right wrist and I am right handed. On the bright side, I can chose when I want to have the surgery and can wait however long I want. As long as the pain is not too bad. I just hope the pain stays on the light side for awhile. I have to budget for this adventure.

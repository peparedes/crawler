i'm surprised about how smoothly my life is going.
i'm also surprised how unconditionally i feel for you.

and it makes my heart feel swollen.



things haven't been bad lately, and i'm not complaining.

"event","i really, really, really wish that some of the things that are bothering me in my head would stop.
there are some things that i want to know, but it would be better if i didn't.
i feel like i'd only get my feelings hurt by knowing.
and there is also a lot of stuff that i'm wondering about, and i wish i wouldn't.
i just want it to all get out of my head and stay out.
grosssss-ness.

also, i am getting my hair dizzyed tomorrow and i'm excited :D
hopefully they'll be able to do it like i want, and it will all be wonderous.
HOPE FUL LY.

"event","my name is erin, and i miss this boy named shaun more then i would miss breathing.

he needs to come home before i stop breathing.

tuesday is so far away :(



in other news, i'm an emo fuck, and so is brian gobble.


in other, not about shaun news, i get my hair dyed and cut on tuesday.
there isn't really anything else besides the 'i miss'es to talk about,
and i don't want comments from people telling me i say that too much,
or that i can't be so sad whenever he leaves.
why the fuck not?
i am miserable without that boy here, and i don't give a fuck who knows it.
in fact, i don't give a fuck that i'm sad. i should be. my heart is in tennessee.
wah."

"event","so friday night i went and stayed at my sister's...
that whole night was pretty embarassing. shaun and i talked, though.
a lot of stuff got brought up, and it was still going through my head long after he was asleep.
he gets to me like no one ever has before... in that way that makes him on my mind perpetually.
i've never really felt for anyone what i do for him, and
i am seriously driving myself insane with these things in my head.
i feel like i just can't be close enough...
it is all so weird and confusing and i don't really know how to react.
sometimes i feel like i'm just unable to breathe.
yesterday at work, between all the questions and shoe boxes,
i was a thousand worlds away.
i just can't seem to make my head stop thinking, and it's leaving me with such a heavy heart.
it makes me think about the dream i had, and i hope it won't turn out like that.
somewhere in the back of my mind i'm still afraid it will."

"event","i feel like i am the biggest open wound right now.
like you could just see straight inside me, and read me like i am.
plain, and obvious, and unabashed.
undisguised and naked.

this is the weirdest, most full-filling feeling i've ever had in my life.
it's like my whole body is to the brim with feeling and aliveness.
i have felt so dead inside for so long, and the sun is finally peeking under this dirt covered hole.
it was so dark and quiet for so long, and now it's so alive.
i feel like i shouldn't be so trusting, because of how unpredictably things happen to me,
but when i'm looking at you, it's not like when i looked at him.
when i looked at him i smiled from time to time.
when i look at you the world fades away.
everything i know to be true is folding into a new picture,
and all of these watered down lies are blooming into gorgeous truth.
it's nothing less than strange.
and nothing far from perfect.
that's right. perfect.
and i'm keeping it."

"event","today had to be the worst day i've had in awhile. i was supposed to see shaun before work, but of course that didn't happen because of some random drama that went on for no reason. at work, which wasn't too bad, we were so bored so we sent paper airplanes over the walls into the knife shop, played card games, and made a memory deck out of journey's cards. brian called me a couple times and we played phone tag, and adele got tuna on my vegan hoodie. TUNA! it was so silly.. i also saw my friend tonight from middle school who got me into a lot of shit that fucked up my life a lot, which brought up bad memories. she said a kid i knew had died and it was because of this one boy who did some fucked up shit to me in the past. it seems like him. i'm suprised he isn't dead. at about 8:30, of course, shaun calls to tell me he's drinking tonight, which means i don't see him today, so i just went home. it figured considering how things were going. last night i said something about how i wished that i would have gotten the choice and he asked what i meant and i didn't know how to explain it, so i told him i'd tell him later when i did. i don't think i'll ever be able to say it how i feel it. brian came and kidnapped me later on and we went to walmart where i tried to smell some shampoo and shot it up my nose. it was definitely stupid and it hurts. on the way home we passed TWO humongous truckloads of chickens who were being sent of for slaughter. it was so disgusting.. i really don't think anything could be worse. brian and i sat out in his car outside my house and we talked for like an hour or two about complete nonsense, and it mostly made me feel better. it was all off subject and random.. i would really like this day to end soon. i feel so horrible today. i miss shaun something terrible, and i feel like i'm never going to be able to see him enough to where i'll be okay for the next day. it's like breathing now. ughuhguhg. love is so ridiculous, but i wouldn't change it for the world."

it seems i've come across all of zac's emails to me. 
they were all the same as his letters. I'm sorry for this and i'm sorry for that.
you were never sorry, you just kept taking and taking.
i know you well enough to know you never loved me.
i never loved you either. that was the problem. i tried and i failed.
it's because you're a fucking asshole, to be truthful. you never cared about me.
you may have at one time, but i became just like the rest of your life.
a piece of shit so fucking worthless you don't even care about it.
you were nothing but a big sorry and i'm sorry i wasted my time on you.
if it weren't for you things wouldn't be so hard for me,
but they're better now, and you've burned with all your letters.
i burned all your shit and now you're as important to me as those ashes.
not important at all. i see you staring, and i turn away.
you've made me cold and i only feel disgust towards you now. 
i hope one day you'll be so long gone from my memory
that anything i remember about you will be so tough to recall 
that i will just tell myself it must have been a dream.
a fucking nightmare.

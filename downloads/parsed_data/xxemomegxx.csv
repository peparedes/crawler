I'm in AZ. It's ok. Hot for 2 months and really nice the rest. I might move back to WA [yes, to Issaquah. I bet YoU guys miss me.. yah right]. I'm not sure if I want to move back..
It's not up to me. It's up to my dad who's an ass btw.

Update me people. I wanna know what's going on in your life. 
Even if you do hate me."

"event","so this is how it is. it hurts to lose people in life, specially those that matter. Nothing I can do though if circumstances won't allow for a remedy. I just 

graduated, and I'm going to lose people anyway. We tell each other we are going to stay in touch, reassure each other we will be here for x-mas in town, but i know 

there are some i won't ever see again. that makes me hurt and feel empty, but thats life folks, and i just need to learn to not let things affect me. i will meet new 

people and make new friends, that is my future, and that is constant, change is constant. whatever is CAN happen, WILL happen, and what isnt meant to be, you get 

my point. i have reached a milestone in my life where i leave my highschool years and start a new chapter in college. 

""In my dreams in dying all the time, and i find it kinda funny, i find it kinda sad, the dreams in which im dying, are the best i've ever had. I never meant to hurt you, i never meant to hurt you, so this is goodbye...goodbye to all of those which I had the pleasure to have known. Despite our differences, whatever they might be, you will always have a place in my heart.""  ~The Roaming Gnome aka Richard"

moving to phoenix, starting school, and my new life, on my own and hopefully full of adventures and fun stuff. besides that, what i want is to meet you wonderful people that i have come to call friends. in past months there were many of you that 

i wanted to meet and now its down to handful. among them being james and chris. jay and kurt. in that timespan, i have had falling outs with people that i trusted and come to love only to face betrayal and feeling lost. today i told james that i 

feared the day that he did the same to him and i think it hurt him. i didnt mean to, i trust the guy, heck i love the guy and come to think very highly of him. i have said it to him and others, he is like the lil brother i always wanted but 

never had, he is my rock...my anchor here on the online world. lately its hard to for me to sleep. i keep thinking about things that i shouldnt worry about. yet here i am, writing about it. ugh i must stop now! haha"

"event","terence. what can i say about the guy. things with Terence were always utter confusion, a chaotic disruption of my emotions and thoughts. @ first i thought terence was an asshole when he first made his appearance to me. after awhile i took 

it as the classic defensive strategy of us closeted non-heteros. i had done it too at one point in time. after that was over i started to fall for the guy, which for me is pretty weird cuz, i mean, im soo picky and strange in my dating rituals. up 

until that point my only real relationship was with Briana but even that was rather immature and on a lower level. the terence thing. i have no idea what it was but i think it was mostly his then-killer personality. he was such a nice fella and 

intelligent and all the things that I thought i would ever look for in a person. however in the back of my mind i NEVER intended to act upon those feelings. i did 

though, and things didnt turn out as i wished they had. too bad so sad, but thats life no? thing that kept me stuck on him is that his shyness and unwillingness for both of us to reach a standing point where we could have REAL talks never came. his 

indecision completely through me off and i tried to compensate for the awkwardness by making a complete fool of myself. when i get nervous i become a danger to myself. i ramble, i become accident prone, i panic and get light headed. that is how terence 

made me feel in those long pauses in our conversations. i think i would have moved on much sooner had terence told me how he felt and all, but him being his shy do no harm attitude couldnt do that, and i stuck to him for almost 10months. i do think 

that something pretty great came out of this though. through liking terence i grew the balls to tell many of my friends at school. ""hey, im not all that str8"". i also grew out of this self-loathing depression i was in, and it also took me out of my 

9/11 depression. I thought that i tried to do my best to help Terence, trying to talk to him, trying to get to know him. eventually i came to the conclusion that, i was truly in love with this dude, and it scared me. it still scares me, to think 

that i felt love again after briana, and it consumed me. i hate not having control of myself and one thing i could not contain was my feelings for him. my remember terence song was White Flag since the first time i heard it, but for the past 
forever i couldnt remember an instance when i listened to the song and really heard 

what it says. same goes with Miss You and Leave. i remembered all those one-sided good times i had with terence, and no matter how much i had learned to dislike him, he really touched my life and i have no way of really thanking him.

i have been sitting here for about 10minutes wondering if i should e-mail him a link to this entry, but at the same time considering editing what i wrote. i could, but i wont, for what i have written so far is my raw emotions, without any sugar coating, 

just my thoughts and honest feelings. i will e-mail him a link, but that is all i should do,  i think it would do me good to let him know that, and he might like hearing something like that."

"event","OOOOO...today was fun! after my last period i went out with my friends to Claire's. My lady friend Sandra wanted to return these earring she bought, but she didnt want to go in. She jokingly told me to do it, and i being a dork as i am, took the bag from her and went to return them. The lady looked at me weird for 

returning earrings, maybe she thought i was a drag queen. I would not make a very pretty drag queen, let alone a pretty me. (low self-esteem? nah!) afterwards we went to return another item at another store. This time she did it herself, while 

her brother and I roamed the Suit aisles. I picked out a couple and put them on including a tie and a hat. keep in mind i had green cargo pants and a shirt under the suit. i was walking around acting all prissy and gay like Justin Timberfake. 

Then I got bored, we looked for Sandra and couldnt find her. I walked over to the customer service and asked them to page her over the speakers. She got embarassed and then we went from that prank to crank calling people that we know. Keep in mind 

i made the calls and i did all the talking. ""hello, yes my friend is karpal there? karpal? oh yes very good my friend. allah needs to speak to you. allah? is that you allah? karpal you bastard, let me talk to karpal."" something around those lines. We 

had fun. Afterwards we went to McDonald's and we bought Happy Meals!! 3 18yr olds with Happy Meals. Children were eating like big macs and quarter pounders as we sat there with out cardboard boxes and lil toys. I LOVE MY TOY! Its one of those dog thingies. Its a beagle. Beagles are my favorite dogs!"

Yes I have always thought Kurt had a type of ""come-hither"" look. One of those more than average stud hot guys. Yeah so he has been cool to me since ever, even after he graduated and became an adult. Lately though, I wonder how far my feelings for Kurt go. It isn't something that bothers me just a lil wondering. I feel this way cuz I see him everywhere. NOT him but guys that look like him. I seen him in TV shows and commercials. Guys at the mall or movies or just around places. And everytime I wonder if I like Kurt. Maybe I do, and more than likely I don't, however just wondering what it would be like if I did is pretty cool. I like ""what-if"" scenarios. Kurt's a cool guy so it doesn't matter the outcome.

omg i just had a flashback people. i am going to cry like a lil bitch. i opened this e-mail. it was this animation of seashells becoming the US Seal to the tune of America the Beautiful. I remember that in sixth grade,i was in choir, (yes me!) and we had this presentation to the parents. We sang many patriotic songs including the first verse to America the Beautiful. When we started to sing that one it began to rain...HARD. Living in the valley that is expected. However the parents started to leave. Our teachers signaled to us to get off the stage they set up but we didnt move. We stayed and sang as the parents left, but some stayed and then the ones that left came back. It was awesome. We finished the song then we just stood there in the rain. No surprise that the following day half the class was out sick, and those that remained got everyone else sick. imma post this by itself."

I don't know what to do anymore. I find myself lost and unable to find my way back to myself. Almost all of my friends from Cali are gone. Briana, well ever since last year when we talked about her upstarting modeling career, we grew apart and havent talked since April of last year. Patty, Cindy, Veronica, Priscilla, Brandon, Sammy, Louie, Anthony, Drake...they are all gone. Don't know what it is, but it seems it started with me. After I moved from Cali a bunch of people headed out of our town to unimaginable places. New York, Connecticut, Virginia, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, and other states. Mass exodus of people from my place, and the people that has stayed behind, I am not exactly close to therfore we dont talk. 1 person left that i talk to and that would be Angelica. 

All I have now are my new friends here that i have known since 10th grade. Bernice, Vic, Sandra, Mary, Jade, Lina, Judith, and Andy.  

Jamie I love you and wish you the best, for you deserve nothing less then that, if you are ever in Phoenix, hit me up buddy...and just remember how our grinding song goes ""those lips and those brown eyes, and that sexy hair, i shake-shake my thing, i make the world want you, tell your boys you'll be back, i wanna see what you can do..."" and our other song from that one time after the game...""Baby don't you wanna dance up on me to another time and place oh baby don't you wanna dance up on me, leaving behind my name and age..."""

Ever since the 19th i have wanted to talk to him and see whats up. Where our friendship stood, or if it had crumbled to the effects of time and ill feelings. I guess it did. He told me today he needs a break from me. THAT pisses me off, because we NEVER talk. Only when convienant for him. Does he talk to me. I realize that most of the people that I know online/offline take me for granted. Like they can just use me when they need someone to entertain themselves with. I won't let it stand, and anyone that tries that with me WILL BE PUT IN THEIR PLACE. I dont deserve to be treated this way..."

Dawn of the Dead on Monday, friends coming over like everynight and then on Friday I ditched school with a friend and met up with two chicks. We went to the movies, watched Dawn of the Dead yet again. I say that one of the girls really tickled my fancy. Roxanne. DSL, big green eyes, smelling of Bod and Glamorous Shimmer, working the Angelina Jolie+ punk rock chick look. She seemed pretty friendly with me too. We played Pac-man in the arcades and that other game, the one where u shoot bugs or something that looks like that,I think its called Gataca. Wellz weekend sure came by fast, nothing really happening there, talked to Jamie a bit, he seems distant since last we talked, then again, he tends to do that on and off. THat was my summary of several weeks therefore i shall start a new entry now."

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff9900>...therefore&nbsp;I had left Dallas Love Field at around noon Central Time. While at the airfield my aunt gave me a lil tour of the ticket area and security screening area. Apparently my uncle and his team designed most of DLF as that airport is owned by SouthWest Airlines. They&nbsp;created the architectual designs for the ticketless travel machines&nbsp;&amp; the&nbsp;security screening area. Anywhere you travel in the&nbsp;country where there is </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>a&nbsp;SouthWest Airlines ticketless travel&nbsp;booth know&nbsp;that my uncle designed it! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Apparently there are 7 series of 737s owned by SouthWest Airlines. the 200, 300, and a few other series are operated in areas between Texan cities <FONT color=#ff0000>and neighboring airports </FONT>in surrounding states</FONT>. <FONT color=#996633>These planes are the older ones in the fleet. They are in working condition but flown for shorter distances to keep them closer to home (Dallas Love Field) for repair and what not. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#996633>p.s.&nbsp;I have flown with SouthWest Airlines since the age of&nbsp; 2, and have only been on two other Airlines.</FONT></P>

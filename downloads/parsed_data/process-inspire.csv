There is a cash bar and they have $1 Burgers light beer(i don't know how to put the .. on the top of the u).  I believe gallery crawls are the first friday of every month.  It's at the Hart Witzen gallery on 36th street.  If you go down Tryon (you go like you are going to G's shop) you will pass a white picket fence on the right and a Fish and Chicken on your left, and at the next light take a right.  Then it's on your right.  Everyone's invited!  It's a group exhibition, 11 artists, from all fields."

Th Annual is distributed to college libraries and instructors of photography, art and graphic design.  Because each annual is a limited edition, we will NOT be going to press to meet additional orders.""

I'm fucking excited!  I find out in Feb. If i made it in the top four or one of the 100 honorable mentions.  But eather way I'm in the top 5% of college photographers.  There were over 28,000 entries!  From UNCC there have been three people to ever make it as a finalist.  Devlin (who is now teaching), Daren (classmate), and Me!
If anyone wants a copy tell me it's $45.00 (I know it's expensive so I doubt n e one wants one but the offer is there)"

"event","Today in class I had a very enlightening conversation with my teacher.  It was about three hours long and it made me think of so many things in different ways.  It was amazing because we trailed off into soooo many different directions, which is pretty much the way my mind works, and apparently hers does as well.  She is also dyslexic and ADD.  Apparently it is very common for people with dyslexia to have ADD as well.  The five minutes we spent talking about suicide helped me more than the councilors or any one else has in the last year.  It made me realize a lot of things that may finally set all of this to rest so that I can move on."

"event","So last night I head home at about 1:30 or 2 am.  I get to the gate and it's fucking chained on both sides!  The only way I can get in is by walking about 600 meters to the gate where you can drive into campus edge.  I start walking there and some drunk driver almost hits me!  

I call the office today to ask if they could leave one gate unchained so those of us who have to stay on campus late don't get killed.  I was told that they are suposed to lock the gate at 12:30 since the card reader doesn't work
so basicly these fucking idiots spent money on a chain instead of sending maintnence to fix what they all ready had.  

needless to say when I went home today the gates were again locked and the security gaurd said basiclly the same fucking thing.  What is wrong with these idiots!  Why does no one have a fucking brain!

I want out of this place!  I hate these people!
I want there to be a way I can say that this is a violation of my lease.
If anyone has any ideas PLEASE HELP!"

This year they had a whole area dedicated to artists alone and they had some sort of competition between them.  They has lots of really neat things, some were very inspiring.  Also being that the heat wasn't quite as bad this year made things a lot better as well.

Maybe I'll just call tomorrow and tell them I think it's to much to have a job right now.""  Well then Brandon come up to me and says Brad said you were wanting to be a waitress, I was thinking Kim told me you wanted to be a hostess.  I then lied and said ""well it doesn't really matter, If you need hostesses more I don't mind"" although I was thinking it wouldn't last long if that were the case.

The fourth of July was great!  I went to the beach to visit my friends on the last weekend before school started.  This was a secondary plan next to the camping trip that fell through due to someone moving to Utah.  It was really nice sitting on the beach on the fourth being that it was no where near as crowded as it was the day before.  I was surprised at that.  When it got dark we thought about going down town and seeing fire works  there but decided to go for a walk down the beach.  I think this was a much better decision being that every person on the beach had brought thier hundreds of dollars worth of collections of fire works to set off on the beach.  you could look down the beach in either direction and see them going off as far as you could see.  It was so beautiful!  We sat and watched for and hour or two and then decided to leave.  I had class the next day to back to charlotte it was:(

on another note my psychology teacher is crazy.  He's funny but hard to fallow.  he talks soft quick and kinda stutters, only whole words rather than syllables."

It's been playing all kinds of crappy music and at the moment it's playing ""rambling man"".  It's some country station and it's freaking me out!  Someone is fucking with me!  The one type of music I can't stand!  The one type of music I absolutely hate!  Now it's all i get to hear.  I can't fucking sleep!"

"event","Hello Everyone!

I know this is kind of last minute, but next weekend, I will be performing in a stage production of The Hound of the Baskervilles, playing the plucky and often on stage Sir Henry Baskerville.  The run is only for one weekend, and I plead with you to come out and see the show!

Information is located at:

www.thehowlinghound.com

I have never been on stage before, and am very excited about the whole thing.  My chances of doing this again certainly increase if there is a mad crush of my ""fans"" at the ticket booth!  

Thank you in advance for your support!  hahahahaaa!!"

In other news, and please don't be angry with me for this, but I dropped another 5 pounds.   When do I start to get nervous?  I thought I would just exercise and eat right, and my body would reach a ""happy place"", but is 5'-10"" and 155 pounds too skinny?  I think I look pretty good, but these last 5 pounds went quickly.  I think starting yoga was the catalyst for the recent renewed weight loss.

So, is some kind of weight gain formula in my future?  Lasagna three times a day?  

Thanks."

"event","Hello!

NEXT year, I will turn 40. For those of you what are numerologically
inclined, this will happen on 08/08/08, which will also be a warm
friday evening in August.

I want to start planning now. I will be saving money for this event,
and wish to erect nothing short of The Party Tent in my backyard for
the coming of my 40th Birthaversary.

What I would LOVE to have happen, and thus will strive to make it so,
it to have my dearest friends and family with me on that Friday,
setting up the tent, working like busy Hobbits of the Shire (frequent
breaks, lots of drinking) to turn my backyard into a sylvan expanse
by nightfall. Once the tent is up, the lights are hung, and the
booze flowing, my select group of friends gathers beneath the tent
for laughter, firelflies, talking and perhaps singing. Fires will be
lit, giggles will be had.

The following day, the Saturday, will be the big blowout party with
everyone and their least favoured relative in attendence. That party
will be loud, crazy and messy...but all during the day, we can look
at each other and smile, warmed not only by the summer sun, but by
the memories of that more intimate night before.

What say you? Can you save the date(s)?

Robert"

We went to a lovely wedding this past weekend, up in Red Bank, NJ, where we also stopped in at Jay and Silent Bob's Secret stash.  My mommy gave me $50 bucks, she is good like that, and I spent $49.18 at the Stash.  I am sure that barely compares to you San Diego (San Diegans?)  travellers, but it was a major coup for me.

The wedding was great, and this weekend me and me froody droobs are off to the PA RennFaire.  This week will be filled with busting the garb out of mothballs and seeing what fits and what doesnt.  I love playing dress up!"

We have the FIOS television service now, in the living room and our bedroom, and it is glorious. The fellas from verizon even went so far as to install a wireless internet router for us, so we are now a WiFi hotspot or something like that. <br /><br />I made a lovely dinner for the Goodely Wyfe and her father, who was visiting and seeing the baby. Whole wheat penne, vodka sauce (from a jar, don't get too excited), sweet sausage, fresh basil and lovely shavings of pecarino romano cheese. If you ever want to impress, those fresh basil and cheese shavings added to the dish just prior to serving make all the difference. The sad thing is....the Clutterhut is currently out of wine!

Anywhoodle.  Has anyone played around with Blender software?  I love the idea of free open source computer animation software for the Apple computers.  As if I didn't have enough on my plate right now, I feel the need to create computer renderings and animations....always have.  Better late than never to explore dreams!

Its a delightful ride, all neighborhoods and paths from Silver Spring to Bethesda, about 5.5 - 6 miles each way, as the nazgul flies, and we better hope we don't have one of THEM following us!

In the mornings, i bless the fact that it is mostly downhill, and i do my best to go slow and easy, as my people, well, we sweat quite a bit.  On the way home, however, I change to shorts and a tee shirt, and push myself to race it out.  Its SO much fun, and my new exercised released endorphins keep me happy and in love with all y'all!

Whoo hoo!"

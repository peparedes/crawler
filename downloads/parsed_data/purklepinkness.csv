So here we go again! Hahaha..

Hey!
This journal is <b><span style=""color:#ff6666"">Friends Only</span></b> so if you only see this entry and would like to read the rest of this journal then.. go think about it. Is <b><span style=""color:#ff6666"">Lozza</span></b> the right journal friend for you? Will you love her forever? Once you've thought about it you'll prolly wanna <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/friends/add.bml?user=purklepinkness"">add her</a>.

Yes I do! And that's why I changed from <b>Avril</b> to <b>Rivarz</b> from <b>Weezer</b>.

So now, if anyone would like the Avril backy I had then you're welcome to it. It's just I spent ages on it and then <lj user=""powtoastman""> showed me the Rivarz backy and I was like <b>I HAVE TO HAVE THAT IN MY JOURNAL!</B>

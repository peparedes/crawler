We had a rubberband war last night and i seriously injured myself, but thats okay i figured it would happen.  Got my first paycheck now thats a good feeling.  Am spending a lot of time with my family and friends, sorority hasnt started up yet, but in two weeks it does, so that should be interesting as always.  Went to a party this past weekend, and oh man i swear it was like everyone from THS that is a year older than men...or two years older, but it was pretty sick, i had a good time dancing and what not, you know the same o same o.  Well, it was sunny today and i cleaned out my car, and put the top down!  Damn that felt good i miss the sun, it reminded me a lot of the good ol times driving around on sunny days, but i miss my friends that moved away or the ones i am not connected to anymore.  Sometimes i wish it could just be like the good ol days.  Oh Eila remember when i totally embarassed myself driving down haynams street ya, my bad, i havent heard from any of them yet, but am kinda glad cause how will i explain that one?  Allright, well i miss everyone and chelle sorry your roomies are stupid butts, nick i miss you, and eila there is an even creepier than creepy todd working at the mall.  Hope school is going well for all miss and love ya!!!!"

First I just want to thank eila for being the DD it was greatly appreciated, and Nick thank you for going to my sorority party with me, I had a really good time, and i know it wouldnt have been as good if you werent there.  I hope you had a good time, i havent really talked to you to see if you did because you never pick up, so hopefully i will hear from you soon.  I also hope you had a good time in frisco.  Marcy lol Javi's sister LOL!!!!  Well, i didnt make any new year resolutions, not even one, and that really bugs me in all honesty i should be able to at least come up with one resolution. It was hella fun hanging out with Jenna last night, you crack me up Jenna.  And can I just say that last nights dennys trip was the best one so far that i have ever had!!!  Eli is a really cool cat, lol eila do you remember the straw he made me that was great.  Oh and the mini bar in my car was good too, man eila i must say you put up with me wonderfully (is that an okay word to use right there?) I mean but i know you have to admit that you had a great time there i know you did!!!!  Well, not too sure what I am going to do tonight need to stop by my dads, wanna hang out with cliff maybe or anyone, i am down to chill i havent hung out with a lot of people in a long time, so if anyone wants to do something hit me up.  I hope that everyone has a really amazing 2005, ""Dream as if you'll live forever, live as if you'll die today"" - James Dean"

It was really amazing actually it snowed the whole time we were there, and it looked like we were in a snow globe i swear.  Eila can go into detail later if she wants but i am so tired i can barely type.  My nephews were cute as hell in the snow, and kayda bear was adorable, but too tiny to be in the snow that long.  Oh! Eila and i took a bomb ass picture together at the snow!!!  Yay for us, its on her wall if you want to see it.  
This week has been fun...Nick i will work on getting that tattoo that you suggested, and Jenny it was fun remembering suicidal fishies, eating wrappers, and what not.  
New Years should be hella fun, eila, nick and i are going to a sorority party at natalies which is one of the nicest party houses ever, it is so laguna beach.  And we have to dress cocktail attire and ya i know that we will look sexy!!  I hope that everyone has a fun, but safe new years, no drinking and driving.  
Ohhh PS Shaleen comes home soon!!!!!  YAY i loooove shaleen!!!!"

It is really nice to just call eila and be like im coming over and then get to see her in like two minutes...and i had a blast last night eila, my hand(you know what i mean), the popcorn, and falling asleep when we said we werent going to.  I missed you a lot, and thanks for always loving me even when i am not the best of friends, it really means a lot, and im sorry for not being a better friend.
Holidays are a lot harder than expected, maybe they get harder with time or age i should say.  I went to the doctor today and he shot me, but its ok it will make me healthy and better than ever!!!!!  Yay shots!!!
Umm, mama kitty is soft, chewy will get old but not crazy, and i miss shaleen and sumeet, i hope that they are having a bomb ass time.  Love all, and happy holidays!!"

I havent figured that one out yet, but I have to soon, or I might go crazy.  It has been wonderful having two of my best friends back in town.  I really do miss you guys when you arent here, things are so much more comfortable just knowing that you are in Turlock.  Thanks for putting up with me lately there has been a lot of shit going on, and I need help understanding it, and taking it in.  I know you dont know everything because I havent shared, it is just too hard for me to admit to other people what is going on, and I will tell you guys eventually, I just need to come to terms with it.  I love you guys with all of my heart.
Happy Thanksgiving to everyone, I hope you ate a lot, and got too full.  And I will see you guys tonight at Marcy's party!!!"

"event","Well, it has been a very interesting month.  I have learned a lot of things, and am going to do a lot of things different.  I had to read this book for school, and it ended up really changing the way I look at life, I would have to say that that book, and Andrew changed the way I am going to act from now on.  That might sound bad, but you know I just realized some things that I never really had before; I guess you just need someone to tell you straight up what the easy and obvious solution is.  There is just a lot going on right now, like a lot of things I dont even know who I can talk to them about.  
School is going allright I have two tests tomorrow, which wont be too fun.  Then this friday I have a funeral to go to.  One of the frat boys I know died this weekend in San Francisco, so pray for him and his family.  All in all this semester has been pretty depressing, but hopefully things will start picking up.
I am looking for a job again.  Hopefully I will get one soon, I need the money, especially if what Shaleen and I are planning is going to work out.  I hope it does, it would be nice, different, but nice.
Well, I am off to go and study over at Shaleen's house; love you all, and miss you all."

"event","Well, last Monday I decided randomly to drive down south...so i did.  I stayed with Eila Monday and Tuesday night and we had a blast.  We went to Disneyland, and I did get autographs and pictures with some of the characters there, which was sooo much fun, and we saw ladder 49 and cried like babies.  It was really nice to spend time with Eila, even if we were just doing the simple things like driving around listening to music, running through the rain while my pants were falling down even though i tightened my belt to like the 7th hole, and getting coffee and watching movies...it was really great to just be able to relax with one of my best friends again.  I had such a good time, and Eila I just want you to know how much I miss you everyday, and I cant wait for you to come home and stay for good.
Then I ventured down to San Diego to see Nick and Michelle.  I made great time getting to San Diego, so I ended up having like an hour before nick got off work, so I drove around SD thinking that that was safe enough.  And it wasnt, but i will let nick post every embarassing thing that happened to me on this trip when he posts.  But finally got together with Nick, walked around the campus, got dinner, oh and ya i know more people at SDSU then Nick does :)  saw reyni and talked for a lil bit.  Then we went to his beach house, relaxed and slept on the most comfortable bed in the world.  The next day I hung out with Michelle quite a bit, we looked at some slutty halloween costumes, tried them on and then laughed when our asses werent even covered by the outfit, went shopping with michelle bought too many things, but had a really great time.  Chelle i had a lot of fun with you this week, it was nice to spend time with you again, it felt really good, i love you hecka, and hope that the diagram i made for you or for chris helped out.  Nick, i just always have a good time with you, you crack me up.  I hope that your week wasnt too stressful with me coming, but you had no choice because i am crazy and was bound and determined to come and see you, i love you a bunch!  Thanks for putting up with me, i am sorry that i am horrible with directions.  
Allright, well Halloween was great it was really nice spending time with my family.  I really do miss them when I am away from home.  The twins were adorable they dressed as batman, and makayla was a ladybug.  I love my family so much, and am really greatful.  Hope everyone is doing well, I miss all of you and love you guys, call me if you ever wanna talk or hang out!!!!  Off to take a nap."

I get initiated this Thursday I am sooo happy I cant wait.  I love all of my new sisters sooo much, everything is cool, no drama anymore...and I love the Frat boys so much, they crack me up.  Frat party tonight, because one of our boys is leaving :(  but it is for work and it is a really good opportunity so i am proud of him.

Watched, a hella sad movie last night with some of my sisters and cried my eyes out.  But so did my sisters so it was okay.  

The twins are cuter than EVER, and they love all the girls in the sorority they flirt sooo much, it is so cute to see my twin sisters playing with my twin nephews I love it!!  And the twins also love Nick, they always want me to call him when they are with me, and then if nick doesnt answer their feelings get hurt, cause they think he doesnt want to talk to them.  Its cute though.  I am glad my nephews love Nick so much, it means a lot to me.

Hopefully I get to see my Nicky Poo this next weekend, I have been going through withdrawals...and I neeeeeed him.  So does shaleen, shaleen and i, thing one and thing two, need him.  lol well I love everyone hope you enjoyed my long post.

Gosh darn it everything bad that can happen does to me, I swear.  We painted our letters today on our booth at school, it is fun doing stuff with my new sisters, even if it is painting.  I watched The Girl Next Door last night, and even though it was basically a porno/nerd movie I really liked it and I thought it was cute.  I am kinda stressed because I have to add another class to my schedule so that I have 10 units, or otherwise I am screwed, and all I want to do lately is sleep.  My body is just so tired for some reason.  Tomorrow I get to put whip cream on my sisters' faces, which should be fun, meet some more frat boys, get my nails done, go to class, do my homework, get my book, and hopefully hopefully (everyone should pray for me) get the english class that I want.

"event","If anyone even has a little bit of love for animals in some way DO NOT GO TO THE POUND!!  Well, today after class I decided it was time for me to look for my new kitten.  I go to the pound expecting to see that one kitten and know that it is just right and that it is meant to be.  Well, every cat in that damn place is freaking cuter than cute, so goodluck just picking out one.  I petted and played with every last cat in the place, until it came down to decision time.  I did notice though that one of the cats was quieter and not so grabby as the others were, and maybe a little sad, and then when the lady that works at the pound came in we were talking about him, and she said that today he was suppose to be put to sleep.  YOU CANT SAY THAT, AND NOT EXPECT THE PERSON TO GET THE CAT.  I couldnt walk out of there knowing that if I didnt get that cat he was going to die, be killed, put to sleep as if he was nothing to the world, and no one would know about his death but me, his last chance to live.  So, I thought about it for a while, went and saw the puppies, came back into the cat area and realized that yes I had to take that cat home.  He isnt the cutest of cats, or softest, and really he isnt the one i would have chosen, but I love this maow maow and am glad that I saved his life.  By the way, his name is Boots and he is about 6 months old.  I should be getting him in a few days, he still needs his shots, and his microchip, so if anyone wants to see him just give me a call.  AND REMEMBER DO NOT VISIT THE POUND UNLESS YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT AN ANIMAL, BECAUSE YOU WILL LEAVE THERE WITH ONE WETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT."

I am afraid to let new people in, because if I do then they will too, and I dont want things to change.  It isnt just friends or situations that are changing, I am, and it is hard to explain, I feel different about a lot of things, and I miss a lot of things.
It hit me hardest today when I was listening to old voice mails, someone who I use to be so close with, is now so far away.  He said he would never change, and that we would always be friends, but he has changed and so have I.  We are still friends and still love eachother a lot, but now it seems like I only have memories.  They are bomb ass memories, but only memories.  Part of the time I wonder if it was a waste, I passed up a lot of things (mainly people) that I wish I hadnt for him, and now I dont know if I can get them back.  I suppose that I believe in fate, and destiny too much, and I am afraid that my lil fairy tale wont come true.  It is hard not knowing what is going to happen next, I wish I could skip ahead in my life story to the last chapter to see if it is a dream come true or a nightmare."

It hasn't totally hit me yet how different it is going to be, but once it does I am pretty sure there will be an emotional breakdown.  There are so many things that I owe to Nick and Eila, that I dont even know how to begin to thank them, or show them how much I love them.  They never gave up on me, and continually loved me, even when I was being outrageous or just plain out dumb.  We will always have the memories, the laughter, and the pictures(wether they are good or bad), and NO ONE will be able to replace either one of you in my life.  I will never know someone like Nick, so responsible, so loving, so girly in all the good ways, so reliable, and so nice to cuddle with(even if it is forced cuddling).  There will never be another Eila in my life, she has taken care of me like no one ever has, and to her i owe great thanks because she has kept me mentally okay, and has loved me regardless; there will never be a better slide, a better person to role onto and just lay there, and one thing that proves to me that she is a true friend she showed her nipple when mine was accidently exposed, just to make me feel better.  Thank you to both of you for everything that you have done for me, and I am sure will continue to do; because i know that friendships like these dont come around that often, and it will be hard to break them just with distance, wether you want me around or not I will be there.  I am very proud of Nick and Eila, they will do wonderful school, and I know that they will be able to handle the new environment, you guys know that I am always here for you no matter what time it is, or what day, so feel free to call, even if it is just to say hey.

And to all my friends that are staying here, I am so glad that you are, because even though we allready have a friendship I know that those friendships are going to grow stronger in the years to come.  Us Turlockians have to stick together.  Sarah I want you to know how proud I am of you for getting a job, and getting your school shit taken care of, if you need someone to talk to or you have questions just call me, I will always be there for you, no matter what you need.  Marcy, man I will miss you, I mean what we are both going to Merced damn the distance wont break our friendship either.  I am really glad that we are going to the same college, it feels so much nicer knowing that I can call you and bitch about classes, and even see you around campus, it really makes my day better.  Well, I plan on writing more later, but school beckons me, so I am off to another day of my life, and I will see you guys all on Monday!  I love you!!  Thank you for everything!"

I really love my brother and am very protective of him.  But the reception was fun, did a lot of dancing and talking.  I love to dance!!!  I wish that i was 21 and could go to clubs, I know that there are clubs for 18 year olds but they just dont seem as fun.  Me and my sister are going to have bbqs and make people dance it might be weird, but I know that deep down inside everyone wants to dance, so i figured i should help them set there dance free.

"event","So tomorrow is my first day of school, i have to be there by eight in the morning and i stay til ten at night...it should be interesting.  I am kinda nervous and i am really excited, this might sound nerdy, but it will be neat to learn again.  If anyone wants they can visit me in merced on tuesdays and thursday i have free time from ten til two on those days.

Last night was a lot of fun.  Eila, Nick and me just like the old days; watched the secret window which is a good movie, ate cake, cake batter, popcorn, and chips and salsa.  Then after Nick left we watched part of kill bill one and now i know why guys like it: hot chicks fighting eachother, death, the pussy wagon, painted on coats, eye patches, ""adult talk talk"", ""even Steven"", cartoons, etc.  I fell asleep withint the first half hour though, so i dont know if it was good.  

Nick's going away party was nice(i am going to come by your house nick and get pictures), Shaleens BBQ was bomb, i stayed up until seven in the morning!!  I cant believe that who stays up until the sun is out?  Me, Shaleen and her family.  Shaleens family is pretty awesome we had a good time laughing, dancing, talking, and doing whatever.

Well, have to get ready to go to merced and pick up my books! Fun Fun.  Love you all!!!"

I am really going to miss them, but I do hope that they have a wonderful experience and i wish them the best of luck.  It will be nice to go down south and visit everyone(Eila, Nick, Chelle, Chris),have a lot of fun, and hopefully everyone gets free long distance because I am calling A LOT!  

Julie, I cant believe you are going so far away!  But I know that you love Portugal, and you will have an amazing time there; I hope that I can come and visit you. Thank you for teaching me to love life to the fullest, to not care what other people think of you, and to love laughter.

Nessa, you are in my prayers, and I hope that you make the team, and if you dont Eila and I will make it happen :)  I love you Nessa and you have been such a wonderful inspiration, you are always loving, you dont judge, oh and hey nessa can you flex for me?  I appreciate the time God has given me to spend with you.

Heather and Nancy, I was almost going to go to Santa Barbara i mean it was very very close, but even though I didnt I hope that you guys have an awesome time there, and that God watches over you, you both are amazing people and I am glad I got to meet you guys this year.

Well, that is all the mushy stuff I can handle writing right now, I really will miss all of you, and wish you all the best of luck.  Without you guys I wouldnt be who i am today.  And I appreciate everything that I have learned from all of you.  I love you guys, and I am always here for you no matter what."

So, until next time, those are the only animals i have killed or almost killed, dont worry i will let you know if there are more."

I really want everyone to know how much i am going to miss them, and the big impact that they had on my life.  I took away something special from each of you and was very lucky to have that opportunity.  Thank you for that, thank you for the memories, the laughter, and the times to come.  Best of luck to everyone in college, and in life.  I love you.  (sorry if that is cheezy)

It feels good to be free, to have that off of me, no more fears, no more worries...just plain happiness."

Frisco was fun, but I dont know its hard sometimes...and this was one of those times.  And questions that I once had, have been answered, and this trip kind of put some missing puzzle pieces together, for decisions that I had made in the past.

Other Highlights from the Trip:
1.  ""I don't know I just do it because Jen does it""
2.  My Corvette sugar daddy
3.  Spare change for psychodelic fun
4.  And yeah, what Nick said, getting to spend time with my best friends

For the first time in a while I looked at the beautiful surroundings,and thought about what amazing things God put on this earth.  While the sun was setting about 50 dolphins had found some fish to eat like right infront of the beach house and it was so awesome...I really love the beach.  But earlier in the day a lot of chaos was going on, a little boy came to us crying and told us he was lost, so we tried to comfort him, we searched the beach, and took him to the lifeguard.  It was really sad, but eventually his aunt came looking for him, and he was safetly returned.

These past few nights have been a lot of fun: hanging out with Shaleen, hanging out with Boesky and big Boesky, and hanging out with Eila and Nick.  I really love all my friends, and you guys are incredibly fun to be with.  I can't wait to go to the Journey concert (Nick and Eila) we are going to have such a bomb ass time.

I really want everyone that is leaving to know how much i appreciated their friendship, and how much they have influenced my life, in one way or another.

Nancy, Nessa was suppose to call you and find out when you can go, or atleast do something will all of us before you leave.  I know that things are busy with packing and getting ready and all so if anyone needs help i am more than willing to help them do whatever.  I am good at packing, picking out college stuff, and other things so let me know if you need me.  I love you guys!!!  When should we go somewhere?  And when should we go?"

So before you blame anyone else or say shit about eila and me being a bad influence on her, i have never forced anyone to do anything, and if they have tried something new while being friends with me good for them atleast they did it with one of their best friends, i am not mad at you chris it is just hard to have a bunch of people talk shit about me, and then hide it, i do know that nick talks shit, he has told me straight to my face, but when people deny it such as michelle that is bitch made,  you were both over at eilas the other day and could have stayed and hung out with us, but i am sure you were too afraid of something we might do.  Friends change and people grow, just because people arent changing at the same time doesnt mean someone is always talking trash.  i am sorry that you guys got hurt  by  people speaking up and actually saying how they feel but someone has to be real and true, people cant just hide their feelings...michelle didnt you didnt so i wont and i am very proud of eila for the way that she has responded to the situation.  I know that eila and i find michelles frienship precious because michelle is very delicate, but so are we, and we can only handle so much.  I have tried to make my ammends and i have opened up and called people and apologized for what i did do in the past, it was something i had to go through and apparently i went through it without a lot of my friends.  But if you are not willing to open up and love again that is fine because i never once judged you for the whole nessa chelle thing, it just honestly hurts to see you michelle sarah and whoever the fuck else betray me.  If you have something to say to me call me fuck this bull shit i am going to be truthful from now on.  I know this isnt just about you guys talking shit about me and eila, but that is what it has turned into and that makes me sad, we all did have fun together, and things are different so instead of fighting why dont we just end it here and appreciate the frienship that we did have, and recognize that it was good.  I will take away alot from you guys and wont forget you maybe one day in the future you will be more accepting and understanding than you are now, and maybe we will be able to keep in touch.  Goodluck with life, college, love whatever it might be, goodluck and Godbless."

"event","Went to Long Beach with eila this past weekend which was fun, stayed on a haunted ship, and went to hooters.  It has been nice hanging out with Nick and Eila, so much.  But it has also been really nice spending time with my family.  I love my sister and her babies.  I found out yesterday that I am going to be the godmother of makayla, which i am very excited about.  My family is very wonderful, and I am thankful to have them.  Got up early today, and was happy waking up to one of my best friends laying right next to me, it feels good to be back in T Town.  I wish I could tell someone something, hopefully with time he will figure it out.  I do want to get a job Marcy, so i will go with you if you want me to, and I wanna go see a movie so lets all get together.  Going to go shower now.   Oh, and eila do earwigs really bite you?  (you know the pincher bugs)"

"event","Hawaii was so beautiful, i missed a couple of peeps from turlock though, and wish that they could have been there with us.  Parasailing is dangerous, the wind sucks, currents are strong, and michael is a beautiful hunk of man. I found a new love for Haagen Daz ice cream, chocolate thank you very much.  Nick, thanks for taking one for the team  ""six is my floor""  I love you so much Nicky. Lining up showing eila our asses was also fun, but accidently showing nipple made me sad lol, i am deffinetly taking memories away from this trip that I will never ever forget.  Thank you for the oppurtunity to make those memories chris, and I dont think I could have been there with a better group of people, I love all of you, and you are each wonderful in your own unique way, but we will have to go back one day so sarah can have her wedding with Gonzo, Eila and Michelle can get ""officially"" married, and Nick and I can get married...sidenote I think we will all miss taking a shit in michelle and chris' bathroom lol.  Peace out, Im tired."

"event","So what do you do when you are having the shittiest week ever?  How come my last week of high school, by the way should be one of my happiest most memorable weeks ever, sucks the biggest balls ever in the whole entire world?!!?  I dont mean to bitch or complain but if i talk to anyone about it i cry.  Today was fun went swimming with marcy, chris, jon, nessa oh and the sea horse or as nessa calls it the dragon. Got hella burnt, but im white so what do i expect?  Does anyone know what it feels like to lose someone you totally and completely love?  If so please comment and let me know how you fix it.  I want to make a post to everyone individually:

Eila-  You are the best friend that i could ever have.  Thank you for always being there for me no matter what.  I love you with all of my heart, and will miss you hella when you go to long beach even though i will probably move there with you.

Marcy- I have had so much fun with you these past few months, and i cant believe we conquered the sea horse!!!  GO US!!!!  Hey we need to do bowling together in Merced.

Nick-  Thank you for always being there for me, and loving me even when i am not there for you.  I finally realized that it sucks when someone you love so much isnt there for you when you want them to be.  I love you and will miss you hella when you go away to college, i will work on being a better friend.

Chelle-  I am upset that we are not close anymore, and it hurt me to know that you think i am a major partier and wont change, when in fact i am the same girl i use to be.  It hurts because i love you so much, and i always will, so i am sorry if i ever hurt you and i hope you forgive me and learn to love me again.

Critter-  I love ya and i will miss u hella when you go away to college.  I think you are a bomb ass mother fucker and i am glad you are with michelle you guys go great together.

Sarah-  I am sad that we arent as close anymore, and that you wont let me into your life, i love you hella and think that you are a wonderful person.  I never stopped loving you, and i hope that you will give me another chance.

Mama Jenny-  I think it is too bad that we lost touch, you really were my best friend at the time, and the memories we had i will never forget.  I just thought i would let you know how i felt since we are graduating and i might never talk to you again.  thank you for the things that you have given to me, i have learned a lot from being your friend and i took away a lot from the friendship.  I loved you."

"event","So, I never thought that I would maybe not graduate.  I stayed home from school today, and finished all of my spanish make up work, and am now trying to finish off my term paper.  Everyone is stressing out about graduation, but I know if I go to school for the rest of the year I will make it.  Cinco de mayo was hella bomb at Oscar's house last night.  The only thing that was bad was that I had to leave, oh and eila chasing me into a room that leads to nowhere.  I love that blizzard.  By the way our country kicked ass!!!  Asshole country sucks!  Allright off to do more homework, talk to ya'all later!  Oh Eila....where?.....in my ass...just chillen....in my ass."

What the hell does that mean?  And why should I read anything Gertrude Stein has ever written after having read this ridiculous excuse for an illuminating explanation?  Why am I an English major?  How is writing a sentence of that type legal in this country?  How can I finish the rest of my research from that book if the argument proceeds from that quote?  Frankly, I'm a bit terrified."

"event","If you're sick of Sufjan's words or his method of explaining his view of God, I wish you'd skip this.  For me, it's nice to be reminded of.

We have been known from the very start.  Our eye color, our hairline, our jawline, the shape of our big toe, the tone of our voice.  These things have been designed from the very beginning.

What kind of music we listen to.  The sort of skirt that looks good.  The sort of cap that fits right.  We have been make to find these things for ourselves and take them in as ours, like adopted children:  habits, hobbies, idiosyncrasies, gestures, moods, tastes, tendencies, worries.  We are all these things.  They have been put in us for good measure.

Perhaps we don't like what we see:  our shapeless hair, our loss of hair, our shoe size, our dimples, our knuckles too big, our eating habits, our disposition.  We have disclosed these things in secret, likes and dislikes, behind doors with locks, our lonely rooms, our messy desks, our empty hearts, our sudden bursts of energy, our sudden bouts of depression.

Don't worry.  Put away your mirrors and your beauty magazines and your books on tape.  There is someone right here who knows you more than you do, who is making room on the couch, who is fixing a meal, who is putting on your favorite record, who is listening intently to what you have to say, who is standing there with you, face to face, hand to hand, eye to eye, mouth to mouth.  There is no space left uncovered.

For a scriptural basis for this, Psalm 139."

"event","Susie, that was really funny.  I always like to reward to wit, so here you go.

This semester has begun with a rather rough start.  I miss Steven and Maureen a whole, whole lot.  The first day of A and S at Vanderbilt usually consists of snobby greeks who try to feign boredom as well and intensely as possible.  One girl passed a paper sharply to me without even turning her head.  I'm probably just being really sensitive.  Anyway, it's been kinda hard.  I don't have any really easy, blow-off classes this semester, so it's going to be a tuffy with 17 hours and maybe one Logic class pass/fail.  One question to anyone who knows:  If I'm planning to take the LSAT this summer yet have never learned about the different kind of fallacies and junk, do you suggest that I take a general Logic class before taking the LSAT??

I saw Don Miller last night at the Belcourt for free.  Apparently a ministry ""porterscall"" invited him to do a seminar for recording artists or something.  And the guy had so many friends that wanted to hear don that they scheduled a book signing/lecture for the belcourt.  I got there at around 6:30 (it started at 7), and they closed the doors right after my group slipped through.  They decided to set up another lecture at 9, which is neat.  He basically read through some new and old material, explaining a little about the conception of each.  He also took questions, which weren't all that notable.  He was really naturally funny and had a cute laugh.  I'll explain in more detail about what he said if anyone wants.

I'm trying to get a job, and hopefully i'll have one within the next two weeks.  I think this semester has the possibility of being really beneficial.  I am going to have take my classes seriously, and I'm having weird spiritual doubts that I hope will eventually lead to a more realistic, concrete view of how me, God, and the world fit in to my daily life.  Awesome, notice the order of those previous three things.  The world now is so different from how I think God intended it to be, and I for one think Don Miller captures the modern God and the modern Christian life quite well.  Hopefully, I can get a copy of his new book soon.

I think I'm going to do an impromptu radio show this weekend, and I'm going to get the new time for my show soon.  I'll post the times of both in case anyone is interested."

And i'm halfway thinking about thinking about taking the LSAT.  That's so crazy to me.  Don Evans here I come.  Now for my Christmas post, I'll leave these lyrics from Oh Holy Night.  I really like them.  They just seem simple and tangible, and I want to be realistic about what's really tangible to me.

Truly he taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains shall he break for the slave is our brother
and in His name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name.

"event","ok.
about el nino and christmas.  when el nino was hott, everyone blamed everything on el nino.  i remember a david letterman skit where someone blamed el nino for their car breaking down or something like that.  It seems that people love to chalk things up to the 'magic of christmas' or 'the christmas spirit.'  I think it's plain awesome and funny that people think christmas is magical.  I hope my credit card bill magically gets paid!  does that count??  and i went to the cool springs mall this past saturday, and I have never ever been to a mall as crazy as that before.  Magic, maybe.  Annoying as H-E-double hockey sticks? YES!

Not only is Christmas approaching us, but the first C in my life is quickly approaching me.  Tomorrow will be doom's day, because i have my final in conceptual physics.  I guess since I revealed that I've never gotten a C on a report cardish thing, it would be fitting to embarrass myself by telling my readership that the physics class i'm doing poorly in used to be called ""physics for poets.""  Ahhhh.

I'll be done on friday, but i still have to help maureen get her whole room unpacked.  Yikes, don't want to think about that for too long."

I dedicate the following two poems to the woman cleaning up the womens' hotty toddy potty when i was at the grove.

Let America be America again by Langston Hughes

Let America be America again.
Let it be the dream it used to be.
Let it be the pioneer on the plain
Seeking a home where he himself is free.

(America never was America to me.)

Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed--
Let it be that great strong land of love
Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme
That any man be crushed by one above.

(It never was America to me.)

O, let my land be a land where Liberty
Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,
But opportunity is real, and life is free,
Equality is in the air we breathe.

(There's never been equality for me,
Nor freedom in this ""homeland of the free."")

Say, who are you that mumbles in the dark? 
And who are you that draws your veil across the stars?

I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,
I am the Negro bearing slavery's scars.
I am the red man driven from the land,
I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek--
And finding only the same old stupid plan
Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.

I am the young man, full of strength and hope,
Tangled in that ancient endless chain
Of profit, power, gain, of grab the land!
Of grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need!
Of work the men! Of take the pay!
Of owning everything for one's own greed!

I am the farmer, bondsman to the soil.
I am the worker sold to the machine.
I am the Negro, servant to you all.
I am the people, humble, hungry, mean--
Hungry yet today despite the dream.
Beaten yet today--O, Pioneers!
I am the man who never got ahead,
The poorest worker bartered through the years.

Yet I'm the one who dreamt our basic dream
In the Old World while still a serf of kings,
Who dreamt a dream so strong, so brave, so true,
That even yet its mighty daring sings
In every brick and stone, in every furrow turned
That's made America the land it has become.
O, I'm the man who sailed those early seas
In search of what I meant to be my home--
For I'm the one who left dark Ireland's shore,
And Poland's plain, and England's grassy lea,
And torn from Black Africa's strand I came
To build a ""homeland of the free.""

The free?

Who said the free?  Not me?
Surely not me?  The millions on relief today?
The millions shot down when we strike?
The millions who have nothing for our pay?
For all the dreams we've dreamed
And all the songs we've sung
And all the hopes we've held
And all the flags we've hung,
The millions who have nothing for our pay--
Except the dream that's almost dead today.

O, let America be America again--
The land that never has been yet--
And yet must be--the land where every man is free.
The land that's mine--the poor man's, Indian's, Negro's, ME--
Who made America,
Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,
Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,
Must bring back our mighty dream again.

Sure, call me any ugly name you choose--
The steel of freedom does not stain.
From those who live like leeches on the people's lives,
We must take back our land again,
America!

O, yes,
I say it plain,
America never was America to me,
And yet I swear this oath--
America will be!

Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,
The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,
We, the people, must redeem
The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.
The mountains and the endless plain--
All, all the stretch of these great green states--
And make America again!

*************************AND**************these stars are jazzy and patriotic

Harlem by Langston Hughes

What happens to a dream deferred?

Does it dry up 
like a raisin in the sun? 
Or fester like a sore-- 
And then run? 
Does it stink like rotten meat? 
Or crust and sugar over-- 
like a syrupy sweet?

Maybe it just sags 
like a heavy load.

Or does it explode?"

""It would seem that Our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling around with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at sea. We are far too easily pleased.""  C.S. Lewis"

The third reason for studying Christian doctrine is its importance for our personal religion. For the sake of our own souls we must know the full content of the Word of God. I say that because it seems to me that many of our most pressing problems in areas of personal faith are due simply to ignorance. Problems of assurance, problems with depression and problems in coping with such traumas as bereavement often stem either from ignorance of Christian doctrine, or from a failure to apply it. The same is true of the church itself. Many of its problems are really problems in relationships, and these are often the result of a defective Christology. We simply fail to live our lives in the light of the fact that in Christ God shows Himself as the One whose nature it is to put the interests of others before His own.

This was the summer it got so hot we put a fan in each window.  At night we teamed up with the Palestenian students and stole tulips from centennial Park.  We used them as garnishes; we arranged bouquets on table ends and desktops.

We burned a wicker chair on the beach at night.  We cooked steaks and pork chops on sticks over the fire.  We went skinny-dipping.  We huddled under the towels.  We told stories about our fathers, about our first kiss, about that one uncle who was always drunk at family reunions.

We sewed shirts for our friends, with decorative borders made from ribbons, with zippers, with billowing collars, with florarl patterns.  Nothing fit right.  We went around shirtless, even the skinny ones, even the fat ones, even the ones with terrific arms and shoulders.

We took our time talking things out; we listened carefully, with a serious look.  We prayed.  We read Paul's letter to the Corinthians.  We tried very hard to understand this.

We went to a church that was in English and Spanish.  We tried very hard to understand this.

We made omelets on the weekends.  We whittled wood.  We knitted hats.  We smoked cigarettes.  We gave each other gifts.  Elaborate, handmade, complicated passive aggressive gifts.

We were afraid to be left behind.  We were afraid to be loved.  We were afraid this would come to an end, as all things do.  We sat on the couch and cried and cried and cried."

""the perfect hostess he called her (she had cried over it in her bedroom), she had the makings of the perfect hostess, he said.""

""she always had the feeling that it was very, very dangerous to live even one day.""

""she would not say of Peter, she would not say of herself, I am this, I am that.""

""How much she wanted it--that people should look pleased as she came in""

""It rasped her, though, to have stirring about in her this brutal monster!  to hear twigs cracking and feel hooves planted down in the depths of that leaf-encumbered forest, the soul; never to be content quite, or quite secure . . .""

""She could see what she lacked.  It was not beauty; it was not mind.  It was something central which permeated; something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and woman, or of women together.""

""She had once seen an old man who had dropped dead in a field--she had seen cows just after their calves were born.""

""That was her self-pointed; dart-like; definite.  That was her self when some effort, some call on her to be her self, drew the parts together, she alone knew how different, how incompatible and composed so for the world only into one centre, one diamond. . .""

""so that any one can stroll in and have a look at her where she lies with the brambles curving over her, summoned to her help the things she did;  the things she liked""
                       and finally

""They went in and out of each other's minds without any effort."""

at the blair music library, you can check out 3 cds at a time for 24 hours.  i figured they'd have some classic rock/punk crap and stuff.  i mostly wanted to see if they had any lps i liked, so i could listen to them on the record player there and study at the same time, since you can't take the records out of the library.  they look like they have alot, but i couldn't find any on ACORN that i wanted to listen to.  anyway, i ended up finding this 4 disc punk compilation put out by Rhino.  It's got some good stuff.  Hits, naturally, but it's 4 cds worth of punk songs, most of which i'm not familiar with.  then i got a new york dolls s/t cd and velvet underground ""loaded"" cd.  so i'm gonna rip them then turn them back in.  and i really have no problem with that, cause if i like them i'll buy them.  so whatever.  but i pay those jokers enough that they should be giving me those cds for free.  oh yeah, i think they have alot of current pop.

It's so compact that my color scheme looks good and stuff.  91 Magnolia is now on Wed. 6-8 following russell and whitney's show.  Sometime last semester, a middle aged man knocked on the door of a practice room i was occupying.  He asked my name and said that he'd heard me singing but never gotten a chance to stop by.  He said he liked my voice and all and asked if I was giving a recital anytime soon.  He said he was taking a songwriting class and heard me practicing, but always was in a hurry to get back to work.  Well this past week who would happen to appear but the same semi-creepy due to my extreme paranoia dude.  He said he had looked up my name on the vand. directory and called the number to ask if I could sing for some Christmas thing but he couldn't reach me.  Then he asked if could sing ballads and if i would be availabe the 30th of January.  I'm going out of town, so i said know.  he said he'd ask the same girl that ""deanna"" (the woman who teaches the songwriting class) had suggested for the Christmas program.  Anyway, I asked his name mostly out of suspicion and got his email and i gave him my email.....................and cell phone number. but i think he asked for some working number and that's the only one i have!....  OH ME OH MY I AM 
AN IDIOT!  I'm going to comb the Blair Directory to make sure there's a Deanna Somebody and I already looked up his name on google and yahoo, but I don't know what i was hoping to find.  Oh yeah, he said the christmas party was on ""the row.""  Now that's a little suspicious to me.  That was enough creepiness to last a couple of weeks.

Speaking of over-sized closets, i went to rcktwn to see fletcher and boy were there alot of lemmings seeing comeback kid/beloved/etc.  that's mean, and i guess i don't really thing that, but its' so fun to have your own style and listen to your own music without some scene telling you what to do. too bad i think so many of those guys are hot, but then that makes me sad b/c i don't want to think they are cute b/c that's not me.  i mean that scene isn't.  i guess i'm pretty regular.  am i too boring and regular?  who cares, get over yourself,'s what maureen'd say and for real do. 

got pretenders II japanese import, but not b/c it was an import.  II is ""!!"" in japanese.  or at least that's what is says on the cover.

i think i'm waiting for the sufjan stevens album to fall out of the sky or something, i should just get.  OH! and tower has so many awesome 5rc releases on cd.  i need to get a job and hit that up.

oh yeah had fun with suzanna and maggy and steven and a little bet with palmer, and fletcher played so wonderfully."

I just keep on playing musical chairs with my junk, rerouting my trash, my backpack, my towels so that they never have a permanent place to hang out.  So it also is with my bedsheets.  g'night"

"event","I've never really liked the saying, ""this is the first day of the rest of your life.""  But I do like the question, ""will today be the day that you _____?""  Though God turns bad things and makes them good, I'm sick of dealing with the consequences.  I'm sick of making excuses.  I'm sick of getting behind, and being comfortable with my reclusiveness, and not facing life head-on.  With a new semester starting tomorrow, I really want to change.  But i've always really wanted to change.  it's hard, but i'm glad i'm not the one doing it.  I want to pursue happiness like never before and find that every thing around me pleases me too little."

"event","I saw Bright Eyes, actually i would just say connor oberst, with maria taylor and family in bham last night.  This is my third time to see bright eyes and these are my thoughts on it.

Connor began the show by playing by himself.  There might as well have been 387 people on stage, b/c i saw his face probably a total of 7 times the entire night and i saw maria taylor twice.  But i guess i can't complain, for someone once let me know that i am probably legally a midget.  saweet.  No the reason i can't complain is that i had a great view all of the other times, and I really don't like staring at him and such.  it's so voyeuristic.  Speaking of voyeurism, that place was like a photo shoot the entire time.  From the moment he walked on the stage to the moment he exited after the encore, those digi came were going off like crazy, leaving me highly annoyed and seeing spots.  LIke for real, everyone was going caraazzzy with pictures.  When they all went crazy at the beginning, some ppl were yelling jokes about them being the paparazzi (sp).

now i don't feel like telling much about it.  I really liked how he kept the number from Lifted to a minimum, but glad he played ""you will.""  OH and so glad he played Arianette (sp).  Ugh that song is so moody and eerie.  Speaking of erie, that's hands down the quietest crowd i have EVER witnessed at an event like that.  IT was crazy!  It felt like reverence or a hush anticipating the revelations of genius.  It was quite unique.  He ended with kathy with a k's song, which made me so happy.  I know he would do an encore, but wanted to end the night with that song.  It could only get better if he played something else from the o holy fools split, b/c that's my favorite stuff of his to date.  It's just some aawesome stuff.  So i was so happy when he played Going for the Gold for the first encore song and was really pleased to hear him end with another of my faves, song to pass the time.  He played a couple i had never heard of, but they were so beautiful.  Tonight he was more relaxed, calmed, than i have ever seen him.  He really made music and was in the moment, i think.  I think he fed off of the silence.  IT was a great show, and i had to make peace with not being able to see anything at all, and just tried to focus on the beauty, depth, and simplicity of this all-encompassing music.

it was also good to see russell, alex, and greg.  i'm going back to school tomorrow and am a bit terrified."

"event","i didn't know stop you sobbing way a kinks song.  i think i like Chrissie Hynde singing it better.  I think it's more interesting sung from a woman's persective.  plus she's such a good vocalist.  I don't think i like live albums, that makes me feel like a prude though.  i'm sure ""prude"" doesn't make sense in that context, but it does to me.  i really want to get the sufjan stevens album.  i'm like 2000 yrs late on that, AND I LIKE IT!"

"event","some country singer redid tiny dancer, and it's simply awful.  that's all pop country singers are good for, redoing songs that don't need to be redone.  maybe that's a little harsh.  it's pretty tragic.  country music videos are the cheesiest things known to man.

i need to practice ear training but i dont want to!  I'm seeing Bright Eyes in bham this friday.  i'm afraid they'll be ppl singing along realllly loudly and i hate that.  then off to nashville on sunday i think.  then moving my stuff to another room including humongous fridge.  i don't know waht i'm gonna do about that.

i've been listening to phil collins, and man does he have some great hits.  what would the world be like without mix stations?  i really don't want to know.  it would be a dark, dark place."

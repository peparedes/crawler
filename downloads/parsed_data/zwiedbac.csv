So, i do not feel well today. I woke up, walked to school, and have gone threw all but one of my classes, and I am just sick of it all. There isnt any point in me doing all of this, none at all, i can not understand why i am doing anything, why that the same route to school everyday, why wear black clothing or worry about what color my hair is, it is freaking platnuim blonde naturally, why am i so against it? Why why why? Why can not i quit smoking, why? Why can not i quit thinking about all the things in my life that make it that much harder to wake up in the mornings. Why do i cut myself? I do not the time, patients, nor have I an awnser for it. Why do i do anything anymore, Gosh, i just want to quit it all, say goodbye to everyone, apoligize for any past indescretions in which i was to blame. Wish eeveryone a happy life, and bid them adiu, and just drop off the face of the world. Hmmm......well, i guess that is just life."

     I'm doing pretty well today. I have been having fun doing noothing. I got another ride today. it twas from a guy named Curtis, which is the guy i hang out with everyday. His car is awesome. Its an '04 VW Bug. he has a son named Onyx. Well.......wow, i really have nothing interesting to say, so i will keep rambling. I wrote a song, and i am sending it around to get feed back on it. I even have a fake band and album that it is on. The album only comes on 7"" vinyl though. So, that is the song below this post. I am a boring person. My neighbor fell out of his car, because the seat belt wrapped around his foot. I dont know how he managed that one. Ummm...........I need to kil the ""durga durga durga""....it needs to die, and that is why i am posting today. Help me kill the durga durga durga. It is an evil entity that need to be banished. Another thing that nees to die is the ""Holy Giz-Sacks of Jesus Batman, I'm gunna wank off in your mouth!"" I had thought that up in josh's car, and its taking over alot of the things i say. It is horrible. Love Your Hate. Ummm......well, I wish i had a milion dollars. GAWWWWW, make it all stop. Help Me!!!!!!!!!!

"event","Well.....i am here to update, so lets get this over with. On tuesday i was hit by a car while riding my bike to school. After asking me if i was okay, he took off, so i didnt get any info on this person. My limp has finally went away, but i have a really nasty cut on my leg. The bike is ucked fup, so i now walk to school every morning(or at least most of the way). On tuesday, i got a ride with my aunt. On wednseday(....)i got a ride with a lady who works in the computer lab here at highland(she sees me in the comp lab all the time, so she knew i was walking to school and gave me a ride.) On thurseday, i skipped school. And today(friday) a preschool bus driver saw me and gave me a ride(which was awesome!!!) but thats all the news i have for now. But i cant wait to get back to Savanna, since i missed seeing Tammy on her birthday. Hmmm.....Talk to you all later

"event","Okay, I'm here to fix a recent(well, not recent, but whatever) post of mine. First, i spelled house wrong. I had left out the ""s"" in the middle, and for that i am sorry. Secondly, i had spelled Tammy's as tammies and i apoligize for that too. Please don't hurt me Tammy, i do not wish to incure your wrath. And for anything i have spelled wrong in this post, please dont yell at me for it."

"event","So, i finally decided to update this again, even though i doubt anyone else in my friend slist does anymore, except maybe Tammy. well since my last updation, alot has happened. Well the Amber in the last thing i wrote i have gone out with......BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE!!!!!!! turns out she is a freaking psycho stalker with so many mental problems it isnt even funny. Even after i dumped her, she wouldnt stop harassing me, calling my house, going wherever i go, trying to find out about me from my relatives. Wow is she crazy. i started going to college, just like everybody else. Tammy went to NIU, and the day she left, wow, that sucked. Anna is going to New Tribes up in Wisconsin, and the day she left really sucked too, but everybody has to do these things i guess. I still see them every so often, tammy comes down almost(if not every) weekend, and Anna does come down every so often. Lamanda is going to highland with me, so i get to see her every tues. and wednes. so thats cool. Everybody is doing there own thing nowadays. Jeremiah and Jeff are senoirs in West Carroll High School. Pat and Ray are both going there too. Bethany and Brandon are still going strong as ever. But i guess i have ranted enough, so im going to stop writting now."

"event","Hey, today was pretty good, i guess. What i did wasn't what i had planned to do, but it turned out okay. After i did some stuff to finish up high school, i was 'spose to go to Anna's house and watch a movie with her, but her mom said she couldn't do that today, so i went around own on my bike until school got over, then i went to Jeremiah's house. So, the magority of the time i did hang out with Anna until Amber came over. After a while of ""playing"" trumpet, we went to Tammy's. At Tammy's house, Kevin and I played pool (we both suck) and then i came home to get Cd's. When Amber and I got back to Tammy's house, we talked about dating and how life sucks for the bettr portion of a hour. The we all went home. Thats all. Have a good night everyone."

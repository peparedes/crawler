If any of the beauties out there want to remedy this, you're welcome to come on by.  Just to warn you, I do bite a little, though not terribly hard.

With all this mistletoe around, moving us all to kiss people whether we like them or not, tonight will be dedicated to love, lust, or disgust.  I'm armed with a flute to serenade your ears with sweet soulful sounds, loin-stirring passion, or...  Well, I'm not sure it's possible for a flute to sound disgusted, but I'm willing to give it a try!

In the meantime, feel free to call in your requests, and those embarrassing stories caused by all the mistletoe.  And since love is always a gamble, let's start the night off with one half of <a href=""http://www.wonderful-music.com/midi/Casino_Duet_clarinet_sax.mid"">Casino Duet</a>."

Welcome to WBLD - your home for all the piano hits.  Your host tonight is Econtra's most handsome creature of the night.  I'm here to stir your soul and set your heart to pitter-pattering.  We'll start your night off with a bit of <i><a href=""http://classicalpiano.com/music/liszt/dansmac.mid"">Danse Macabre</i></a>.  But, by all means, call those requests in.

Sims 2 is fun, the character's facial features can be tweaked as you want.. but I got 1 frustration over one tweak: why don't they have more anime style hairs instead of dreadlocks and neatly combed hair?? 

In the end I still need a blog to release and rant out stuff. Oh well.

Kinda ... mentally tired nowadays. I feel that I spout stuff that I'd not normally do before, such as lewd jokes / comments. -_- gah."

"event","With the amount of cliques i have...

trying to list them all here...

let's see..

Kazoku clique (ppl in #kazoku), 
tenipuri clique, 
1/2 jrocker clique (jotaro, 
luel's clique (vic, leo, ying etc),
da jie's clique (nev, mana,liz etc),
MAC clique (gin, yuan, sean, andy etc),
manda and gang clique, 
brudders clique, 
wingz's clique, 
mask sista's clique, 
pichu's clique (long time no see em) , 
#gamefaqs clique,
#anime clique,
newbies clique, (from here 14 liaoz)


think that's about it...

other than... brudders, kazoku clique, i hardly reveal really intensively into my private life. I do talk to very lil ppl from outside of those 2 cliques.. as in regarding my personal stuff. 

somehow... even these 2 cliques.. my relation with them's erroding... i feel so horried... i can't talk to anyone regarding myself cos.. i'll constantly feel horrible and kept bugging that person with my problems.. up till the point where i piss that person off. i used to be like that in early pri sch... until i kept everything to myself. now i'm like that again.

my inner self tells me not to bug and irritate any more ppl, but i feel so... constricted all the time. at least saying out to certain ppl i trust makes me feel a bit better.

saw joseph at natsu matsuri that day.. had a bit of talk abt stuff.. the days where me..... him.. and alvin... we are mostly hang ard each other last time cos no other ppl are interested in model kits and such... thinking of going to alvin's place sometime during the weekends.. maybe after the MAC AGM..

i've still been feeling like shit nowadays... emotional rollercoaster... even tho everything is normal on the outside... i still feel very.. 'repressed' and stuff like such. just last week wanted to cry out so much, unable to do that. 

working at kyonichi again now.. damn busy. don't visit me during my working hours, cos i wun have time to entertain you. working more hrs in order to pay for e raw materials for the crosspunisher that avery is helping me to make.

If there's anyone willing to be my listening ear... comment on here. or something. really much thanks for all the help...

looks like the 'counsellor sen0' is in need of counselling now.. lolx the irony. 

this coming sunday need to go for checkup... check for blood disorder... thalassaemia... if minor.. then i'm just a carrier.. very unlikely i'll be major.. cos i won't be living now if i am.. need blood transfusion every 1-2 mths if i DO have.. which is almost impossible.

that's abt it.... for the flamers.. i don't give a F*** care anymore..."

wow. since quite long that i've ever blogged properly here.

ah well.

till now i still have no idea on where i'm supposed to go this weekend. as in the exact venue/ meeting time.

sometimes, i'm glad i got to know so many people. ok technically i'm glad most of the time.

but for some certain times.. i wish to holler, to be crazy, to be mad. when i tried to do that, somehow i can't do it. no matter how much i tried to force myself. all i could do is... stare blanky? stick a solemn face on my head? *shrugs*

i'm really contented nowadays. i really am.

yet there's also this... part of me crying out."

gomen miyuki.. i was not able to come down to NYP even when i had the time, cos a) my mrt card no $$ b) i only had enough shillings for bus rides. c) travelling all the way to your sch would had tire me out. ^^""


today.. woke up.. 10am. feel damn edgy. and flu-y. and still very sleepy. received leo's sms abt meeting up slightly later. ok.. then i went online for a while. took a bathe before meeting luel and leo. SK would be late, so we 3 headed for Popular first. (it's like.. i should had met them THERE instead of the mrt station. lol)

yawned uncontrollably and STILL feeling edgy.. *heng i control otherwise you won't know it's me liaoz* then we meet up with SK after luel got her sch stuff... as usual.. des students have to fork out $$ to get their materials. haizz...

went to TM's yoshinoya. i had a beef bowl with the soup. not really concious of what the rest had. rofl. then when we are heading back to TP... luel started to feel Z_z.. haha... ^^"" same for me.. but i roughly 'woke' up when i reached TP liao.

went to imouto's studio section... and drew random lousy pieces of 'artwork' with lousy proportions and whatnot. leo was feeling slpy too *think he's still a bit ill since last thurs. lol* while luel had grp proj discussion with her frens. den when it was time for her lecture me, leo and sk sat down and practically talk crap (as usual) well... not really crap la. but nothing that made a huge impact.. mostly abt self defense, training and martial art stuffs. bought an ice kopi for myself, but it din really helped in perking my brain up.

then SK went for his math tutorial.. and 10 mins later luel's lesson finish. rofl. i went ahead to have my 'dinner' of a normal portion of fried rice in des canteen. den we 3 went to swensen's to have ice cream.... shared with luel the choco thingy while leo had the banana split. haha inside got cookie~ and i totally went a bit 'ga ga' while eating. rofl.

den send leo and luel to the bus int.. lol that last part was amusing.. (leo i din touch her ah! LOL)"

"event","20 Questions to a Better Personality

Wackiness: 34/100
Rationality: 28/100
Constructiveness: 68/100
Leadership: 38/100 

You are an SECF--Sober Emotional Constructive Follower. This makes you a hippie. You are passionate about your causes and steadfast in your commitments. Once you've made up your mind, no one can convince you otherwise. Your politics are left-leaning, and your lifestyle choices decidedly temperate and chaste. 

You do tremendous work when focused, but usually you operate somewhat distracted. You blow hot and cold, and while you normally endeavor on the side of goodness and truth, you have a massive mean streak which is not to be taken lightly. You don't get mad, you get even.

Please don't get even with this web site.

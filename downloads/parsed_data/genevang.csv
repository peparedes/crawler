This is Mavis, we looked through Herman's laptop and saw this link with password saved. 
If you had been reading this, Herman had passed away. Maybe he just could not get over it as easily."

"event","As I'm writing this, the signing of the house is near. I still harbour hopes of a reconcilation but I know this is almost impossible. Until today, I do not understand why everything that I do, all the love I give in and all those care that I gave to you, in return I get such a treatment from you. I do not even have the chance to speak to you alone, for 6 years, we have been a loving couple, we see and smile at each other everytime we meet, we hold our hand tight, we give each other sweet kisses. And all that you do is listen to everyone else except me, everyone who tells you to leave me because I gamble, everyone who do not know what I have gone through. But you, you should know better than anyone in this world. I did not end up like this because I gamble, there are so many reasons which you refuse to listen, you did not give me a chance to speak to you, you just left me this way and claim that you are happier. 

Even as we are going to sign the cancellation of our house, you also want to bring your parents along, in what ways have I showed to them that I do not love you besides me being not SOKA? When you come crying to me when you quarrel with them, who convince you that they are your parents and should not hate them? Who is the one who visits them every first day of the Chinese New Year and never fail to buy mooncakes for them on festive seasons? Who is the one who takes in all the scoldings when you refuse to go home and who is the one who stays awake all night to persuade you to go home? Nobody sees all these except you Geneva, but why do you choose to treat me like how you treat all your enemies? You just avoid and make yourself lose all feelings for me, this is no way to treat a relationship Geneva, a guy who has given everything to you, and now, you just throw me into a deeper hole, a hole that I can never climb up from.


Bye Geneva."

"event","Geneva, I do not think you will see these entry, even if you do, I know you have given up all hope, given up all feelings, while I'm still stupidly hanging on to some hopes. I was wrong to be rash and ask you to leave, I thought our love was so strong that I didnt think you were serious when you said if you leave, it will be the last of us. I thought we could calm down and talk about it later. Little did I know it was to be the gravest mistake I would ever make in my life. 

I know all these words no longer mean anything to you. Try as I might, I can never speak to you in person anymore, I can never tell you how much I love you, how much I can give to have you back. When I see other ppl's gf who left them for another guy, I always tell myself it will not happen to me because Geneva loves me deeply and I love her as deeply too. But I messed it up, I made wrong choices in my life, I didn't respond to you when you were hurt. And now that you had totally lost everything for me, then I feel how important you were to me and how impossible I could leave without you.

When your mum want to slam the door against me, I realise this r/s can never be recouncile. Because no one around you will ever help me, everyone around you tells you to leave me, I want to hate everyone but I know I am the one who made you sad, very sad. But does anyone out there know how much and what I have done for you? No one can tell that to you, no one will help me tell that to you. I know I will get all sorts of abuse if I go to your house, but I was prepared, I wanted to save this r/s regardless of all the abuse, but no matter how I try, I can never see you, I can never talk to you anymore.

If ever I have the chance to have you back, I will even kneel down in front of everyone and tell them I am sorry to make you sad. They do not know how much I have given in, I will still do that to show them how important you are to me. What others think I do not care, what matters most is Geneva you, how much you are willing to trust me? Why has our r/s come to an end like this? I learnt something from this 6 years, no matter how much I have given in to someone, the love will still disappear if I do not sustain it for a second.

I can sms you that I hope you find someone better than me, but deep in my heart, I am sure I love you the most in this world. As I cry now, I swear to you even if I moved on with or without another person, you will always remain in the most important part of my life because I had given you whatever I can in my life, and I can never do that to another person anymore.

I really love you Geneva.... All my life."

I thought after a few months, the feeling will be weaker and the love will be gone. But I was wrong, the more I try to forget, the harder it is to let go, the more I want to let go, the more I miss you. I know you have let go, but I want to tell you I have not, even as I'm typing this, my tears flow down without control. I've forgotten only one thing - Happiness. I dunno what it means to be happy anymore. I had acquire a new skill, that is to cry in less than 2 seconds. All I have to do, is open my wallet look at our photo, my tears will flow. When I see your msg asking me to move on, I cry in the bus, I weep in front of everyone. The pain is so hard to take. All I ask for is one more chance from you, but I know it will not come. I can only live and pray everyday for a miracle to happen, that is how I keep myself alive everyday. I can't make myself drunk, because I know if i ever get drunk, I will end my life. The thought comes to my mind everyday, I really love you too much. No one can understand."

I miss you so much, we really can do so much together in our lives together, why do you not give us this chance to? We have come so far together. We meet with difficulties, but I always believe we can work things out together, but instead, you listen to your friends and ignore me at this most difficult times. Our lives should be decided by ourselves and not by what others say. 

After so many years, why are you not convinced how much I love you and can give to you? Why is it that nothing in our relationship is worth you giving us another chance? My heart aches everyday, every night I think of you, every night I cry to myself. Everytime you ignore my phone call, my heart sinks deeper. I really hope for one more chance Geneva. We can work together and spend the rest of our lives together, why are you so persistent this time? Why can't we work things out like what we always do? Why do you let us go through all these?

I'm willing to do anything for you, I can change to whatever you want. I told you before I will keep making myself to be the person you want, 10 years cannot, 20 years, 20 years cannot, 30 years and so on until the day I leave the world. But now, it's so pain that I really think of leaving already. Why are you so determined Dear? 

We always have each other in our heart. Can you please hear me out? Please........"

I have caused you all the sadness, and now I'm feeling it myself, you said it's too late. I'm sorry, if only I could have said all these during the time when we could still pull ourselves back.

"event","I guess it's supposed to be like that. Just that i feel that i've been suffering for very long already. Maybe my other sufferings are short-termed, hence I find this so long. Maybe my major suffering is during school, the exams, which only last at the most 2 months. Now till July is still about 4 mths away, which seems like my ""exam"" is still 4 mths to end. That's why i find it so long. 

I guess people's other sufferings are usually a long time, like some people who are struggling with terminal illness suffer for few years or few decades. So my struggles as compared to theirs is really nothing. Just that I feel dejected that after so much efforts, still progress is slow. and seem never ending.

But i'm definitely sure that one day, when i look back at these, i know that i've overcame it. I did not run away from it. I overcame it. Hence, I must definitely score victory, it is coming, spring is coming, I know it must come. Just not now. I must be patient and continue to persevere to await its arrival for me to realize that all my problems in future will be solved in the similar manner - perseverance, then await for the arrival of spring.

I can and I will definitely emerge victorious to show the validity of what I'm practicing. It's tough and painstaking. Excruciating at times even. But I must score victory. This is a golden opportunity!"

"event","Once upon a time, there lived 2 dogs, Happy & Mugen, living in a town called Tampines.

Though they are not in any way related by blood, but they live together, hence, they are like brothers. They have their usual sibling rivalry, sibling quarrel. But afterall, they are siblings right, so they still love each other. It's the zui3 ying4 xin1 ruan3 thingy.. 

One day, they had a visitor.. by the name of Bobby, a shitzu (the owner claims it's pure breed, but i think not). Bobby knew Happy long ago, because once upon a time, they were roomies at Hillview. But that was a long time ago. At first, Happy & Moo were sniffing Bobby, the newcomer. And Happy and Moo tried to do.. ahem.. the dog's thingy on poor Bobby..

However, Bobby only had eyes for Moo, and he persistently hunted Moo down wherever he went. The depressed Happy could only watch helplessly as his beloved Bobby was in love with his brother. He took a step back and hid in a corner, heartbrokened.

Now, Happy is in my house. But his heart is still at the eleventh floor. He's begging me to let him back... But we should try to let him forget about this unhappiness right... :P

I have it all in my handphone. I wish i can show you the photos. Will upload it soon once i find the stupid firelight cable!"

""Using your voice to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo will spur you to action and give you strength and vitality. It will even activate the protective forces within the universe,"" SGI President Ikeda says in his Feb. 21 address. ""By chanting for the people you meet, you are embracing them with your spirit and influencing them in a most positive way. And through such prayers, you will strengthen your ties with those people to whom you naturally feel close. Your prayers profoundly affect friends who may not embrace faith, creating heart-to-heart bonds and helping them form a connection with Buddhism.

""In Buddhism, nothing is wasted. Freely tell others about this philosophy, in your own words. It isn't necessary to cite complex theories or arcane terms. Since the Buddhist Law is inherent in your life, you don't need to be anything other than yourself. Chant about whatever your concerns are, whether they be problems you are facing, your goals, kosen-rufu or the happiness of yourself and others. Your earnest prayers will bring forth your inherent Buddhahood, enabling you to build an eternal and indestructible state of life.""

"event","Coping successfully with stress requires that we try to see ourselves in a different light. We need a deeper understanding of our truly limitless potentialities as well as our vulnerabilities, how we can develop our strengths as individuals through mutual support. 

First, establish and maintain your own goals in life. Second, live so that you are necessary to others -- such a way of life is ultimately beneficial to yourself. 

Just as physical training can bring forth the unseen capacities of our bodies and intellectual training develops our minds, our hearts can be trained and strengthened. Through the process of overcoming grief, for example, it becomes possible for us to see beyond our own sufferings and concerns to develop a more expansive and robust sense of self. This experience can inspire compassionate acts for others who have known this same pain.

Now, more than ever, we need to develop the qualities of strength, wisdom and hope as we forge expanding networks of mutual support.

In the end, the key to living in a stress-filled society lies in feeling the suffering of others as our own --in unleashing the universal human capacity for empathy. There is no need to carry the burden of a heavy heart alone."

"event","15 minutes ago, i felt terrible, i felt depressed, and was really down that i kept thinking that life is meaningless and i have nobody on earth that i can talk to about how i feel and thought that nobody can give me comfort and make me feel better if i can get to talk to them about how i feel or if someone can even bother to lend me a ear.

HOWEVER!!! 

15 minutes later, which is now, i feel extremely overjoyed and filled with zest and my chest that is so clotted up and weighed down by all my problems is finally loosened up and i can breathe properly now again, really very happy. It's a sharp contrast and i feel that life has so much meaning, life is beautiful and i can do so much more, i'm in control.

What happened in between that made the difference?

It is Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. It's so mystical. It further confirms that this law is true as i had experienced the actual proof. I only chanted for 15 minutes, and already i can feel this benefit.

So next time, geneva, if ure looking at this again in future, whatever problems u have n however down u feel, just chant. Straight away kneel down in front of the Gohonzon and chant. Definitely u can feel the difference. It is a HUMONGOUS difference. Do not hesitate and think of other solutions. Just chant.

Everything is possible through the power of the Gohonzon. And i want to always experience abundant joy even at the lowest point of my life. I must have extremely strong life force and abundant wisdom. 

YAY!"

"event","It's my first time bringing kids out to the maths-n-science trail at the airport today. I only looked after 14 kids and i already can't control them. Sigh, think i can't be a teacher already la! Mavis said i looked too kind, then how? Must be fierce to them? They r just kids leh.. According to what the Soka Kindergarten Principal say, that kids are curious n it is often the teacher that killed this natural curiousity in them. I don't wan to do that, but i also dun want them to anyhow run. sigh! My throat hurts from all the shouting, and sherylene said musn't shout to control them. Must come out with more tactics already ah!"

"event","My favourite rabbit Murphy passed away today. The clock stopped at 8.40pm, the time she passed away. It was raining when she died... even the sky cries for her. She's such a good rabbit.. gentle and girly and very pretty with long curly eyelashes and huge eyes... I've been an irresponsible owner.. It's probably my fault she passed away. I'm so guilty. I'm sorry Murphy, I really am. I do love u alot still and will always do. I will pray for u to be reborned as a human being, a NDB member. :) It must be that our karma linked that's why you were part of our family. I wish to be connected with u again in our next life. Please take care girl.. :) I will always remember how you were throughout ur life, as i've been ur care-taker since the day u were born. U r always my favourite rabbit.

She's the one in the middle, the gray one. she's the sweetest thing. my dearest murph murph.

"event","I used to think that blogs are just a way to keep track of your life. But it is until today that i realize it is also a way for OTHERS to keep track of your life. We are so cooped up with our own world and life these days that we have no time to meet people who are not in direct contact with us in our day to day life. Means, besides ur family and boyfriend and the something else ure engaged in like work or school or for me, Gakkai activities, u simply have no time to meet ppl that used to be in ur life like ur sec sch friends, ur jc friends, etc.

So since things are the way it is now, i guess i have to keep an online diary too, so that ppl who are too busy to meet me or ppl who i am too busy to meet up with to update them about my life can find out by themselves by the very technologically-savvy way of saying, ""with just a few clicks of the fingers"".

Yuppie. hehe."

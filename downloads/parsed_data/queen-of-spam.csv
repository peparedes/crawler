THIS IS MY POEM IF U DON'T LIKE IT FUCK OFF!!!!!!!!!!

nothing is really
everythings fake
no one can feel
we're all a mistake
nobody is true
we're all a lie
are personalities we out grew
are happiness is a war cry

ANOTHER POEM!!!!!

pain is all i ever feel
anger is all that i reveal
death is all i can aspire
as i reach into the fire
the demons warmth is closing in
now i know ill never win
the madness with in me is killing my brian
fear of lose im ging insane
satans power is taking over me
red is all that i can see
he took away my tortured soul
i cannot feel i am not whole

ONE MORE POEM!!!!!!!!!

i feel raped 
and abused 
kill me now 
theres nothing to loose
no reason to live
every reason to die
nothing to give
everyday i cry
my soul is gone
my body is dead
never being born
its all in my head"

You're the epitome of insane. Either you're very smart, or you're too damn stupid. The world is your playground, and everything -- and everyone -- in it is a toy for you to play with. People should be scared of you, but because you're so affable, they aren't. Tough for them.

Controlled substances and altered states of consciousness are your thing.  You'll try anything once, and most things twice. Society may look down on you, and you may get arrested every now and then, but this <b>really</b> wouldn't be a problem if they government would just get a clue and legalize everything, dammit!<br>

yeah...whats up??? im so tired. today im going to see rocky horror. SWEETNESS. ive been feeling pretty shitty lately. um its raining.

WANNA HEAR A POEM I WROTE:

i cut myself
you won't understand why
i cut myself 
i hope to die
i cut myself
the anger goes away
i cut myself
i wait for a new day
i cut myself
i go insane
i cut myself
let out all my pain
i cut myself
thats what i do 
i cut myself
because of you

HERES ANOTHER POEM I WROTE

i feel raped
and abused 
kill me now
theres nothing to loose
no reason to live
every reason to die
nothing to give
everyday i cry
you see me living here
everyones torturing me 
everything i fear
the light ill never see
my soul is done
my body is dead
never being born
its all in my head

ONE MORE POEM:

you leave and close the door
the depression comes back stronger than before
i cuddle up in a ball and cry
i pray that if i don't see you i won't die
you see its not a lie when i say i can't live without you
and it worries me to know its so true
because without you i cannot smile
and im not going to see you for a while
the world is so hard when your not near
everyones against me everting i fear
i can't stop thinking about what you are to me 
your the only one who cares the only one who makes me feel free
but everytime i see you leave
it gets harder and harder for me to breathe
and now you leave and close the door
i don't think ill live anymore

hehehehehehe doyou like my poems there so depressioning aren't they i want a smurf i need to poo. bye bye

Yoda. Jedi Master. Your word is pretty much gospel, as far as others are concerned. You stick to your roots and have a good head on your shoulders. You can always provide a good response to those in need of answers, or those who just want to talk. You may not look tough, but inside you've got more power than the majoirty of people.<br><br>

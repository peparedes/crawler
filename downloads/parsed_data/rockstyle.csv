"event","Nothing is going right today...everything irratates me...my plans..aren't going according to schedule...everything got fucked up today and I look like shit.  I didn't fix myself right today because I thought that I could go se my barber early and get back home in time to clean up...Barber not in..throws off the rest of everything I had meticuously planned today.  Now I am at work, still looking like I just woke up and I am attempting to be cheery..

"event","Ok, I am here at work..typing my first entry here in my Livejournal.  What to say, what to say.  It's pretty sunny here in my beautiful city of San Francisco, but my hands are freezing as it is fu*king cold here at my place at work.  My girlfriend *N* and I took some studio photos the other day and we received them today.  I have to say that I felt very happy with the way they came out.  I wish I could have kept all of the pictures but alas, we only could choose two.  

Next time we take pictures, I'll try and not look so damn preppy, and I will be sure to include my beautiful blue dyed hair in those future pictures.

BTW can anyone help me write some songs?"

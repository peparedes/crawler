"event","fuckin workin... school is almost over! one more test.  it's been a crazy year.  this year i would say i learned a lot and i lost a lot.  i learned lots about love and life, lost my first true love, sort of, screwed up lots of school, and its been crazy.  i can't believe that life after high school sucks this much.  i wish now more then ever that i could just replay the past 12 months and do a few things different.  i'm seriously thinking about the armed forces as a career oppurtunity.  i think what i need is a little discipline and a gun and i'll be ok.  i'd also like to assist in the death of a 'rab.  seriously though the world is a big place and who better to show it to me then the good old government.  a couple questions i have though, do they still take taxes out of your paychecks, even though you are government?  and what is the firing rate on an m16? because if its faster then my model 98 then im def joining.  oh and i hope boot camp isnt that hard.  because i'm fat.  but i think this may be a good thing for me though, even if i only stay in for a couple years i think the experience will be invaluable in the long run.  plus they have this buddy system thing where you and up to 4 friends can join together and stay together as long as possible and thats a pretty cool feature.  i hope they have lots of cool devices there because i like devices.  idk we'll see what happens.  i hope this summer kicks ass though because its been a long time since the last one.  well you guys have a good one i'm gonna go not work some more.  talk to you all later!

"event","i'm so sick of shit... i wish it were possible to just press a button and start life over from the beginning... theres so many things i would do different.  i've come to realize over the past few days that i have pretty close to zero motivation and that the only things that drive me to go through the motions and do the bare minimum are not enough.  i think its neccessary to set goals and work much harder then i have been to achieve them.  looking back, i feel like everything i have done has been half-assed or selfish and i have to change a lot of things.  i'm probably the least motivated person i know and i dont like that feeling.  i rolled through the carmel school district doing just what i had to do to get through without any troubles and now i'm paying for it.  it's not that i didnt get the knowledge that i needed its simply that now that im out in a world where you can't sweet talk a teacher into giving you just a few more days and there's no way to just not do homework and kick ass on tests and be absolutely fine.  i miss that.  and the fact that i miss that is pretty sad.  i definately could have done much better for myself if i had put just a little more time into things or just concentrated on something untill it was completely done.  it's absolutely sad that i can not excel in something unless i am really interested in it.  i wish i was interested in sports or something that way i wouldnt be such a fat ass but i had to be interested in these damn computers so now i am a fat ass and on top of that i'm struggling harder then anything to get my computer science degree but because i only fuckin focus on things i like i never can seem to pull through in anything other then my something that has the word ""computer"" in the title.  i wish i knew how to change.  change is something i've never ever been good at but i know that if i dont change now it will crush me.  i will not allow myself to be one of these god damn 30 year obese fucks living in their parents basement playing video games all day.  i have always looked down on people like that but i know for a fact that if i do not change my ways that is exactly where i am heading.  i can't let that happen to myself.  so hopefully i'll be able to turn my self around.  i plan to quit smoking, lose at least 50 pounds, and get on the dean's list at westchester.  probably not this semester, but definately for the next one.  sorry to bore you all with this pathetic story i just had to get it all out and this is a pretty decent way to do it.  thanks for listening, you guys are the best.  now im going to go get some sleep so i can wake up on time and i dont have to send poor mitch all the way to valhalla by his self.  goodnight all."

"event","hey guys its been a while so i figured i would say hey!... the past few weeks have been a hell of a rollercoaster and unfortunately a lot of it is private enough that i cant share here but what i will tell you is that on my way home my ipod played the following songs in the following order that completely sum up my past few weeks...

Eminem - Spend Some Time

Dashboard Confessional - Places You Have Come To Fear The MOst

Ludacris - Blueberry Yum Yum

Dave Mathews - Angel

it was pretty crazy the shuffle mode has never actually played 4 songs i like in order especially 4 songs with such heavy meaning ;) so yeah crazy few weeks.... i'm so sick of school i cant wait till the summer.  i seriously need to figure life out this summer... i am debating between another semester at westchester, taking a break from school and joining the coast guard (no joke) , or something new and different i havent thought of yet :) whatever i do i hope shit goes my way cuz i havent exactly tackled the past year the way i should have and i am already paying for it.  i just want to get out of this town with all its bullshit its really starting to wear on you... people never cease to suprise me and its crazy how you think things are one way but they really are horribly, horribly different.  but what can you do so is life and we have to learn to deal with it or just be stuck and ya cant be stuck cuz that would blow!  i have decided to keep my car now that i have it back from the body shop but it definately needs a little help... im thinkin a nice stock wing and some nice rims, maybe a little suspension action and it DEFINATELY could use a little boost... we'll see what this summer brings.  all i can say is that i wont be happy untill i see 14s!! well i guess thats about it... maybe i'll post a little more from now on, maybe not, we'll just have to see what happens.  so stay tuned folks! until next time..."

"event","Wow it's been a while since i posted last.  well hi everyone.  i decided this morning that i have to acquire a new mattress.  the one i have is extremely comfortable but thats the problem.  it's like too comfortable and soft and when i wake up in the morning i'm all achy.  its totally gay.  anyway.  i'm a poor fuck so everyone should give me money.  i want to buy some tech.  lou knows what im talking about.  i worked a lot of hours this week so hopefully i'll be able to get something.  i'm trying to decide if i should get a dell dj (like an ipod), a palm pilot (the palm zire 72), or a digital camera of my very own (either the canon a400 or the nikon coolpix 4100)  what do you guys think?  the palm can take pictures and play mp3s but it cant hold that many mp3s and the picture quality is bad.  and its kind of expensive.  but its a cool device none the less.  idk.  school's going pretty well this semester and im very happy about that.  i'm sick of being the douschebag that never does well in anything.  my parents have nothing to be proud of me anymore and i dont like that.   I'm kind of bummed out lately cuz kelly found out yesterday she's probably going to albany in september.  not that im not extremely happy for her because i am it's just going to suck not being able to see her whenever i want.  but whatever happens i know that we'll be ok in the end.  this keyboard has very stiff keys and it kinda hurts when you type fast.  i think i might be starting to get carpal tunnel.  i should get one of those sweet ass ergonomic keyboards.  i think im gonna go download a movie.  suscom finally took over for rcn so now our download speeds are splendiferous.  if only i knew what movie i wanted to download.  ah well.  talk to you guys later.  peace."

Well we went to the city for mike's birthday and it was a lot of fun.  i managed to burn myself 4 times throughout the night but thats ok.  the best part was when i was driving down and i managed to burn my lips.  dont ask.  all i know is that i'm never eating at mars 2112 unless my dad's paying or something.  its too damn expensive.  we were gonna go to hooters but that was too far so we didnt.  i'm working on a new website its gonna be the craziest thing i cant wait to show you guys.  oh well my fingers hurt so i'll talk to you guys later.  peace."

to take anything too seriously.*</i> <b>pinkgrlie21</b><br>
&nbsp;i think i might throw these little diddies in every now and then
cuz sometimes you just see a cool away message and i think everyone
should be able to share in their glory
anyway.
so today was a pretty cool ass day! kinda. <br>
<br>
ate dinner with the family for the first time in like 10 years... its
kind of a mandatory thing though cuz it's my brother's birthday. he had
cheesecake. how cheesy is that. everyone knows your supposed to have
like carvel cake on your birthday. what a cheeseball. anyway. so after
that kelly came over and we went to her friend adam's house in dover. i
kinda like hanging out with those kids they can be fun sometimes. not
all the time, but sometimes. <br>
<br>
i miss my friends a lot lately... we need to like play paintball or
something. we need to bring brian gmuer tho so we have someone's ass to
go ""pink seagull"" on. ah the good old days. also i need a new screen
name if anyone has some ideas just leave em. getting kind of old to be
going by the name ""freeturkeys""... it just has less and less meaning
since i havent worked at a&amp;p in quite some time. <br>
<br>
anyway back to the topic at hand. so we were at this kid adam's house
for a ""party"" BUT as we pull into the driveway his parents pull in
right in front of us. hehe i guess they were supposed to be in the city
all night or something. so the party does what any other party would do
when the parents show up... everyone went outside and they had a little
bonfire with his lawn furniture and started riding quads. my parents
would probably crucify me if i did that. some kids have all the luck.
anyway that was pretty fun but now i smell like campfire. so im going
to bed.<br>
<br>
good night."

"event","this is the future.  anyway.  hey guys!!  it stinks that lou has left!! i can't wait till that kid moves back for good... we didnt even get to get our egg sandwiches from hill and dale.  i may just have to go and eat one in his honor tomorrow!!...  i think i ate some bad honey bbq wings today, kelly's dad got them from hannafords and they sold them out of a refrigerator when they should have been frozen... so if my plan works out i will get fantastically sick and sue the shit out of hannafords, take over the whole chain, and never have to work again.  untill then, tell your friends and family that i fix computers so well i should have a statue, and not only that but i do it for a very reasonable price.  i wonder if anyone really reads this... how about this... if you are reading this leave a comment simply saying ""hi"".  i refuse to post untill i get at least 5 his so ya better do it.  livejournals are crazy man.  oh also, to the 5 people that will hopefully leave comments, tell me what you think of my color scheme.  sometimes it looks gay to me and sometimes it doesnt but im color blind anyway so it's hard to tell the difference.

peace

ps.  stay away from lotto scratch cards... me and kelly put 10 dollars in last night and bought 10 scratch cards and we just kept winning and buying more scratch cards... at one point we got up to 17 dollars but we couldnt stop there... oh no... we had to keep going and going.  by the end we had 9 dollars but instead of cashing in and taking the 50 cent each loss we decided to go for one more round.  we didnt win on a single card.  so basically we spent half an hour scratching those cards for absolutely no reason.  fuck."

"event","well its the most dreaded day of the year... my brother's birthday :-( ... anyway... whats up guys!? had a rather crazy day... my grandmother's arthritis was acting up in her knee so me and my dad had to drive down to the bronx to take her to the hospital... turns out theres a lot of other garbage i dont care to discuss going on in my family and it totally sucks.  after that me and my dad got ripped off at some unneccessarily expensive pizza place in bedford hills then went to bedford acura to look at the cars we wish we could own. dad decided on an rl, i want an rsx, and we both want a tsx to share. too bad we're both poor.  i decided tonight that the rsx is ergonomically perfect for me and that it will be my next automobile after the new civ is payed off.  my dad is getting the old civ all fixed up for my brother and i have to admit im kind of jealous.  i have a lot of memories attatched to that car and i just hope he treats it well.  its kind of sad... my dad talked to the guy at the shop and the bill is already up to 800 bucks and they still cant get the hood open.  turns out i wasnt as nice to that car as i thought i was.  there were no rear brakes left, the cv boots are ripped up, probably has tranny issues, the engine burns a little oil, and the motor mounts are just about shot... there's no filtration for the breather, the intake is held onto the manifold with duct tape, and there's no radio.  other then that it's a great car and he should feel special to drive it.  so anyway now that my tangent is over.... after that i went home and met up with kelly.  we fought a little at first but i think it was just because we were both tired... long day... then we went to sam goff's house for dinner cuz sam's leaving tomorrow to go back to school.  it was good to see that whole crew before they all scatter.. i really like those kids even if we dont hang out with em that much.  well i guess we do.  go starbucks.  anyway... after that we went back to kelly's and i watched her brother mikey for a while cuz she had to go to her aunt's and tommy wasnt home yet.... after tommy got home i came home then i played nfsu2 for a little while and now im here talking to you giving you a play by play of my day.  wow.  anyway... crazy day and i hope you all have a fantastic evening.... till nextime, peace outside."

"event","<FONT size=+1><FONT size=+1><FONT size=+1>OK </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT size=2>basically lou's dad didnt wake up untill 5 in the morning on the day of our departure. so that right there set us back about 4 hours. it turns out that florida is really far away. like 18 hours away. it sucks. it's a good thing me and lou didnt sleep that night because man, if i hadnt been able to sleep through the trip, i may have shot myself. so im back from florida. florida was cool... new york is... cold... it's been a pretty good week. it was good to see kelly i missed her so much... when i got back it was crazy. first my car's battery was dead. so i took old blue to go see her. now its about 11 at night and i have no radio. taking old blue sucks. so i get to kelly's and i am tremendously hungry and as we drive around i decided it was a good idea to go to adam's diner in wingdale. BAD IDEA... talk about a seedy place... there was this hawaiian dude wearing chef pants and a lumberjack jacket serving as the manager/chef/waiter. i had a western omelette on a roll, kelly had a bacon/egg and cheese sandwich.... they werent that good... so we're sitting there enjoying our fine cousine when all of a sudden the chef starts blasting welcome back by nas and dancing very exageratedly... then as his song finishes, this middle aged couple from massachusettes comes in and starts playing prince on the jukebox, and you could so tell that they had just come from the run down motel down the road where they had crazy passionate sex.&nbsp; so we finish our sandwiches and i drop kelly off at home.&nbsp; now im heading down rt 22 towards home when all of a sudden i see flashing red and blue lights behind me.&nbsp; this can only mean one thing.&nbsp; turns out i had 5 separate things wrong with my car that each deserved their own ticket.&nbsp; lucky for my this particular officer had had a long night and didnt feel like writing out 5 tickets so he sent me on my way....

other then that it's been a relatively mild week... i went to work one day, have been snowed in for two, and the rest of the time either hung out with kelly, ended up in the city with kelly dave and lou, or slept.&nbsp; or played nfsu2.&nbsp; and you're right i really just dont feel like typing anymore.&nbsp; so you guys have a good night and perhaps i'll post tomorrow.&nbsp; peace................

"event","Well im at lou's in florida and we are about to embark on a trip across this fat ass nation.  i really had a kickass time down here... universal is a crazy place and the rest of the state is very flat and has straight straight roads.  you see really far.  we took lots of pictures today.  i got one guy in a crown victoria.  great shot.  anyway i'm kinda scared of the impending doom that is our journey north.  mr. sabatini is coming with us.  too bad.  this will be good for me.  i cant wait to get home to see kelly as much of a good time as i had down here i miss her so much.  she means so much to me and i know i dont show it all the time as much as i should... she's the best though and i hope she knows it.    i feel bad for lou there's a lot of bs going on in his love life.  i know that everything will be ok in the end it just sucks when things get sidetracked or turned around for a while.  at least now im not alone in having sensitive feelings about a certain someone..... *cough* limo *cough*... anyway...
    anyway livejournals are pretty sweet i've always been good at spilling my mind onto paper just never really do it... sorry if shit's kinda random but hey im a random guy what can i say... i hope everything goes okay with me and kelly shit has been so fantastic lately and i hope it continues.  im so happy of my little genious (deans list x2)and i know she wont have a problem getting into the school she wants to next year even if it's gonna suck for me to watch her go... but we're young and there's so much ahead that its too tedious to concentrate on short term bullshit.   you know i really miss my family.  we have to have a family gathering soon.  anyway.  i wonder how long this trip is going to take.  i know its gonna be at least 14 hours and thats a long time but it's probably going to be more like 19.  one thing i do know is that there are 56 crackerbarrels on i-95 between here and new york.  56.  thats amazing.  im a little upset bc i've been playing need for speed underground 2 with lou since i got down here and i got pretty far but now since im going home im going to have to start at the beginning.  blows.  gay.  anyway.  talk to you guys later my fingers are beginning to hurt."

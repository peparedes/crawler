Alright, here's the best pick up I've ever heard;

So this dude I'd met, shows up at my house, right?
&He asks if I have a phone.
I Say ""Yeah. Why, do you need to use it?""
He says ""No, I was just wondering if I could have the number for it.""



Maybe you just had to have been there &known who said it.
But what's the best you've heard/used?"

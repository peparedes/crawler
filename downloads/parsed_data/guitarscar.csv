"event","it's been a while since I've written here. and so far, my life has been going pretty well, except that my hair now looks awful thanks to the stupid hairdresser who ruined it with her dangerous weapon, ie: shears. and there's some hole that's wanting to be filled. but the only person who might have filled it is lost to me. definitely. 

something Nicole S. wrote made me think about whining. yeah. sometimes I look at me and I realize I whine because I have nothing better to do. but partly because I feel a need to have something to scream about to make life un-worth struggling for so that someone will come along and make it worthwhile to struggle for. make sense?

anyway, christmas passed by in a quick blaze of people and lights and no company except the family. somehow i'm missing out on everything and some odd dream I had, a little sexually explicit, has chilled me somewhat. it's like an omen, especially when you're a bystander in the dream and the other four people are Form 2s and a storybook character. and not a particularly striking one either, Mr Banerjii. (Cat's Eyes, Margaret Atwood.) something disastrous is going to happen and shatter me and I'm not going to be able to do anything about it. someone want to listen to me rant on MSN now?

incidentally, the F2s in the dream I had are all xanga AND livejournal users (well, some who don't update on xanga or livejournal) AND two of them are from the Drama Club.

quite an omen, I must say. some longing to have it all the same way again?"

"event","i would like to clafiry - clarify something. I Did Not Tell Him. as Matt so faithfully pointed out, the email was not read. therefore, I have not told him adn he does not know.

although, a worse thought that makes me shiver is that he could have read it and passed me off as mentally incapable of anything.

the link to my english assignment still stands in the previous post, if anything. 

Nicole - I tried calling just to check the number and no one picked up. is something odd?

I like his shoulders. I might have mentioned that in Xanga. and he has nice hands. sculpted too, I might add."

I had this entry to type out, where I was so crushed and disillusioned...but I'm not so now...just a little contemplative and accepting. but, as an example..

""I can see myself now: comatose, bloated and propped up on the bed, ugly angles exposed at their worst. and you know i am unworthy.""

but I've been preparing The chronicles Of Sofia Morris for your bored entertainment.  the thing that bothers me about it is that even though I scored full marks for that project, I was probably and most definitely graded on student level, and somehow that bothers me, because i know i didn't really deserve full marks and i might've learnt more if graded on a higher level with more critical comment.

he's like...i could compare him to a movie star, one whose fans constantly surround him and i'm somewhere behind them in the middle of the crowd and wondering how i got there. it's a little like that. i don't know what gets me hooked.

i did want to write something profound and meaningful here, but it all came out wrong.

sachin asked precisely what i liked about him, and i found it was generally more superficial than most...if you want a complete list...leave me a comment...little incidentals, you know. told you i was an attention whore..

http://home.ripway.com/2004-11/200637/

select all those links with entry 1 aand all that . try reading it in order.

also -

""When I am lonely for boys it's their bodies I miss. I study their hands lifting the cigarettes in the darkness of the movie theaters, the slope of a shoulder, the angle of a hip. Looking at them sideways, I examine them in different lights. My love for them is visual: that is the part of them I would like to possess. Don't move, I think. Stay like that. Let me have that. What power they have over me is held through the eyes and when I'm tired of them it's an exhaustion partly physical, but also partly visual."" - Cat's Eye, Margaret Atwood


it might run something along the lines of that: a visual love. though it would be safe to say that personality plays quite a role in this serial drama.


but thank you for comments...thank you thank you thank you...i have all holiday to be rejected :)"

"event","<i>Degeneration<i>

November 9th, Tuesday

it's officially the holidays. already the first tendrils of boredom have crept in and sprouted a tree.

i don't understand why everyone i spoke to was so caustic and happy today. Because some time ago, I can't remember when, I forgot what happiness was. and left me with myself.

people are like seasons...they'll come and go, leaving you.

I spent today like a zombie. Walking around I sat in the front row, in front of Darryl's band, waiting for something to happen. I don't know what I wished, really, but I wished that I could find what I wanted, and thta Isa would stop singing, because the music was great without him. 

I believe I'm an attention whore. I crave so much of it because I think I don't get enough.

Television is boring. I spent two hours staring at the screen, absorbing the characters and wondering why they were so dumb. The sheer idiocy of them was truly astounding.

I've been so unhappy it's sickening. Even when I try to convince me I'm happy, under the ice is another bubbling broth of depressant...I always claimed I was apathetic, and presented this delusion to the world untainted. 
Yet when I presented this statement to the Discussion Forum in Drama Club (alas, poor Drama Club!) Ms Eunice laid that fact bare and lying, and with unblinking perspicacity branded me as..well.

""there's something that you DO care about.""

I know I care too much about _____ and that is bothering me as much as failed attempts at poetry do. ""Tom"" in the Chronicles of Sofia Morris does exist for me, as Sofia is obviously a very exaggerated, partly fictional version of me. and still more pretentious too. the irony, as continued in the Chronicles of Sofia Morris, is that he's abandoned his email, a day before Sofia sent the email. It happened, really. the relief was like a lukewarm gush of water in the shower: not shocking, but relatively disappointing. that was August, just before the holidays. and now? hitting the 6 month milestone at a langurous pace, the holidays strike.

on the whole, though, it is discouraging and disillusioning that none of my submitted poetry made it to the school magazine. no doubt the concept of *shudder* depressive, dark ""poetry"" was too much for them to handle. everything in there is funny-sarcastic, moralistic and thoughtful. there is nothing in there that has a title like ""a boring case for the psychologist"" or ""Hand Me The Fashion Magazine"", nothing that suggests negative emotions that will mess up anyone's viewpoint of Sri KDU as a jolly, wholesome school. so Mr Mark was right.

it's not officially holiday time - that's 12 am - and I'm bored stiff and miserable. a few friends've been asking me why i haven't told ____, or more accurately, confessed. why?

1. it's been (may till now)...months. with a failed attempt, would I really bother to try again when fate has thwarted me? He's just my prerequisite hell.
2. i am <b>afraid<b> of rejection. oh sure it would be excellent material for tear-clogged poetry, but no.
3. i am unworthy. looking in the mirror is helll, and it's surely no surprise to any of you. i am short..and worse..

you, you, and you. subscriptions are just a mark of courtesy that's quickly dropped. you don't really read my blogs. i'm just there as someone else on your mile-long list.

repetition has been present today of all days, and it's exhausting me."

"event","i would say much here...so much. the modem is very hot. i have nothing to say.
  

The Audience

these words on the flat-screened instrument
could belong to anyone.
that's our surreal interaction:
reduced to stark letters on online programs
veiling and shrouding emotional bombs.

you'll be doing what you do, i'm sure
i'll be here tongueing your satire
while i laugh -- still, i love your laugh better, --
at the wit which you direct this play to your own accord.

you see, i'm a marionette in your hands
playing into the story, and
observing this litany of history repeated.
i am the audience because you are dazzling,

and draw reviews of approval
faster than lightning and twice as bright.
while i continue to clap
when everyone else has gone.
 

that's all i can do...write about him and curb my tongue. i post all that on misrule, xanga. it's there for you to see. 

guess the rain's going to come down on me soon enough. i can feel the raindrops and hear them even as my fingers desperately try to drown out the sound of the ominous, hollow drops and i'll drown in a flood of emotional craze, in sleep and awake to slumber and nightmare and sleep to beguiling dreams.

there...

the sad thing about leaving drama is that i'll never see all the F2's again alltogether...and not him either..not as often, anyway..

but..

i keep your photograph/ and i know it serves me well - Seether, Broken


yes. so there we are...

because I'm broken and I'm lonesome and I don't feel right when you're gone away ...


there we go. that's life in a nutshell."

"event","it's a time of retrospection and, you know, being atrabilious, melancholy.
I really despise Tuesdays and Thursdays. I hate it. I just seem to get particularly mean/nasty/suicidal/lovestruck/melancholy on thsoe days.

fucking days, you know?

i've resorted to scraping the blade against my skin in a pathetic attempt to, you know, satisfy that stupid craving. all it's doing is giving me a fine powder off the top layer. you know, the dead skin cells.


consider:

     being kicked out of the cheerleading team. and someone else, *myrah?* didn't? i'm just too angry now. i'm just to upset. i was going to cry. 

stupid Niken. 

Nicole quit. I was going to rant and scream at her, but after being kicked out, the options of doing that are Zero. what do I do now but mope with my books and no one?

frankly, yes.

sometimes i just don't like drama. not itself itself, but the time used, being in the same room as Niken and ____. my tongue just seizes up and i can't think of anything to say. it's all wrong. everyone else looks so cozy together. that is to say, they all seem to fuckingly intune. everyone loves guitar and all that. everyone else can play better guitar, and i feel like a stupid freak in there.

stupid Matt. 

i'm not a fucking muppet...am I?

watching other people crack witty conversation with each other, with him, is kind of, you know, sheer hell. so i just walk off and stare morosely at the playground, and walk back to find everyone already inside. 

i can't get my mind off him, this, it, everything.

and i'm yelled at by my violin teacher for not practising. well, well, well, moronic old me. i never wanted to learn that stupid instrument in the first place. no matter how gorgeous, how sweetly mosquito-like that bow squeaks on the strings, much less play in a fucking concert. of course i seem easygoing. i do that to satisfy you. and YOu. and YOU. and i can't think what possessed me to say yes to my parents. and of course, if i didn't, they would have been so disappointed. i can't bear it. angry yes. disappointment no. it fucking scares me.

and you know, getting thrashed in chess by Sam is not a good wy to start a day. and again, kicked off the team. and again, getting 4 hours of sleep. and again, being callled MUPPET. and again, you know, getting homework, homework, homework. 

and you know, life is just a lie minus the f. life of course is a lie, and the f stands for 'friends' which means, none at all.

i wonder if you need friends to survive. if you didn't even know what the word meant, if you were left alone, how would you know?

please, make me happy, someone. make me a pillpusher. talk to me in the library. kill me, talk to me, bury me. get my mind off all this, him, it, his, her, mine, hers, him, that, is, all, them, they, I, me, him, him, him.

"event","first, the tragic events. i am close to having my keyboard taken away, because of my dismal exam results. yes, gloat all you want. i know you're gloating, i know you're triumphant over your results. yes, i don't give a shit for your opinion...depends who you are, you biatches.

my results are dismal. 

my life is slipping downwards.

my love life is an empty chasm. i need therapy, possibly from everyone possible.

my parents are giving me hell about the internet, and my drama.

it's very awkward casually strolling past your ex-best friend, surreptitiously avoiding eye contact and rolling your eyes each time the other speaks. also, having her little faults pointed out to me one by one, now that we've seperated. (for more information, view www.xanga.com/Heroin_e) 

so, now, let's get explicit. i am madly in love with ___. i don't know, i'm confused. but i want to type out all these colours and thoughts in my head. don't bother if you hate stuff with bad punctuation.

uneasy sensations the stiffening of the limbs when I make eye contact the sudden rigidity of my throat when I try to speak to him all these screams that could flow out of me in torrents I would love to hold him there forever in my head as a beautiful geisha boy standing there gazing into the distant soccer field the white light of the misty forbidding day shining illuminating his face hold him as a forever vision a statue of immense beauty i Want him to hold forever that picturesque stance, continue to make my heart dance with impulse and nervosity i want to say it, say it, just let time be frozen and say that 'i love you' blue lights: i love you. white lights: it's hard to pretend that i don't see him when i do i want the touch of his hand on mine. the tingling crackling air around him frightening enough the sparks he emits are awsomely seductive!..the aura, the smouldering half-smile, the slightly sadistic look in his eyes i love that."

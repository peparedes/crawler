"event","For whatever reason I only seem to update every three weeks or so, if I'm lucky. You'd think I would make more time to do this but I haven't put my journal in my thoughts too much lately because with Christmas coming and shopping and trying to find everyone's gift and everything I haven't had a lot of free time. And whatever free time I do have has been wasted sleeping or doing something useless. I guess I'm just lazy.

It's currently Haunukkah, so happy Haunukkah to everyone on my friends list who celebrates it. In fact, happy holidays to everyone for whatever you may celebrate. I love the holidays, I love seeing my family and friends and everyone I haven't seen since the last year.

Marion is here and I am happy beyond belief, I missed her so much. We went shopping and spent way too much money but it was definately worth it. One of these days we need to go boy hunting because we both need to get out and meet people. Some time before Christmas I need to go over to her house and give her and her family their presents. I hope they'll like them.

I'd better go clean my room because we have company coming later, peace out.

Oh, and I have new colors and icons. Check them out if you want to."

"event","I am a horrible best friend. I feel so bad that I haven't been around at all when Marion's been upset and I don't know. I just feel awful about it. I've just been running around and doing so much lately that I haven't had time to be online or anything like that. Before christmas I want to fly to New York so I can take you shopping though, I still owe you a shopping trip.

This update really had no point other than apologizing for being a horrible person. A real one will come eventually."

"event","Marion is here. Not here at my house, but here in Norway. It was so good to see her again, I missed her like crazy. We screamed when we saw each other and smothered each other with hugs. I think I scared Kaisa and Shawn. Oh well. Kaisa has gotten so big since I last law her I hardly even recognized her. She's looking more and more like her mommy every day. I got her <a href=""http://www.gymboree.com/shop/dept_item.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=1562895&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=1627135&bmUID=1068667300450&productSizeSelected=0"">this</a>, <a href=""http://www.gymboree.com/shop/dept_item.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=1563339&FOLDER%3C%3EbrowsePath=1627135&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=1627135&bmUID=1068667306939"">this</a>, <a href=""http://www.gymboree.com/shop/dept_item.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=1563319&FOLDER%3C%3EbrowsePath=1627135&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=1627135&bmUID=1068667406746"">this</a>, and <a href=""http://www.gymboree.com/shop/dept_item.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=1563343&FOLDER%3C%3EbrowsePath=1627135&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=1627135&bmUID=1068667473903"">these</a> for her birthday because I missed it and I wanted to get her something. I hope she likes them and wears them often. My mom has been so cute since Marion arrived, she just ran up to the door and grabbed her, making her drop everything she was holding. They stayed at my house for a couple days and then they went to her house to see her family. I hope I get to see her again before she leaves because I'll go crazy if I don't.

I think I'm coming down with a cold or something, my head is killing me and my nose and throat feel stuffed up. Getting colds all the time is one of the few things I hate about winter, that and the fact that I'm not a fan of being cold all the time.

Anyway, I'm exhausted so I'm going to try and take a nap, see you all later."

"event","My best friend is coming to Norway tomorrow I am so excited. I haven't seen her in God knows how long and I've missed her like crazy. She's bringing Kaisa and Shawn so I've been going crazy cleaning the house and preparing and all the things you need to do when visitors come over, plus convincing my parents to let them come over and not to make a big deal about it. It shouldn't be hard since they love Marion like their own daughter but they might have a problem with three extra people in the house but I don't care, I AM SO EXCITED!"

"event","I'm never sure how to introduce myself or how to make a good impression. I guess I'm just way too shy for my own good. But I'll give it my best shot anyway.

My name is Marit Larsen. I'm twenty and I'm from Norway. My best friend is Marion Ravn, she and I were in a group called M2M and we were together for years before our record label decided that we weren't selling enough records and decided to drop us from the tour that we were on with Jewel. Whatever, we're still friends and are still making music, only we're on our own and writing our own songs now. Marion's gotten a deal with Atlantic, our old company and she's going to be huge. She has the talent and the drive and she is already amazing anyway.

If you want to know more about me, I'm just an average girl who happends to have a passion for music and writing and singing. Since I was little I've always wanted to be a musician. Since M2M split up I've been writing and recording songs on my own but I don't know if I want to be worldwide famous. I like romantic walks on the beach, holding hands, and good movies and have a weakness for shopping and chocolate. 

I think that covers everything. I'm freezing so I'm off to go put on more clothes. Bye.

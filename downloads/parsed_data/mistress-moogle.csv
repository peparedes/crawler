And they all start talking with me, I just love it!<br /><br />We bought the fabulous megatron-stroller, we will rock forever with this thing!<br /><br />And I'm cheating on le boyfriend... darn... I can't quit courting Paris ^^"" <br />I do it a lot slower now but I still love this great great city!<br /><br />Ah and the ass is still growing but it's not huge yet because every two days I've got someone starting to flirt with me from behind. Ok, ok, they stop as soon as they see my huge belly but still... it's great to know that my behind is flirtable :)<br /><br />The belly now not only likes music but also likes ""the purring kitten on the belly"". I believe our daughter will be a kitten herself if Knacki teaches her how to purr so early in the belly ^^<br /><br />So the poll is about our babyname; Whaddaya think of the name ""<u><b>Scarlett</b></u>""?"

I was about 16 years old, maybe 17? If someone had told me then and there that I would be listening to Anne Clarke while showering my huge pregnant belly in my shower near Paris just before leaving for a fleamarket...

Either I would have loved to know it would all turn out this nice, either I would have been the Anne Clarke ""fuck life, fuck you""-gal :D"

I've gotten nauseous again...

I need to center myself on myself...

I have never been able to focus myself on me because I was afraid of losing all human contact. How do you keep friends when you cannot do anything more than work and sleep?"

So our kid will be born in wealth, happiness and love.

Apparently in China, parents were holding off to have kids until this year and now about EVERYONE is pregnant in China!! This'll be fun!!

Oh and the haptonomy thing! It's rocking!! It's the ""science of cuddling"" and le boyfriend and I are both professionally cuddling the baby, even now when she's still in the womb. It's quite amazing and the big advantage is that we can even move her the way we want her to move, for instance: away from a full bladder... Very whew!!

And finally, the kid LOVES Hairspray! We've been to see it twice and twice she just loved it and kicked and rolled throughout the movie. 

Yay!"

"event","Today I forgot my keys...
AND my cell phone...

So I couldn't call le boyfriend to come and rescue me...
Luckily there was msn messenger at the groceries shop next door so I could messenge a friend to call le boyfriend who then could come to help.

And when I started walking towards the subway station I also discovered that being pregnant, you cannot jump elegantly from a small border anymore. Actually, you cannot do ANYTHING elegantly anymore... For instance, the only way you can elegantly close your not-even-high-heeled-shoes is when you have an elegant boyfriend doing it for you...

Even a hormone tear-crisis in the middle of the night (""I'm uglyheeheeheeee..."", ""No-one loves meeeheeeeheeeee"", ""I can't even coohooohooohooook"" etc) isn't dramaticly elegant anymore...
Nor is laughing elegant anymore because it only makes me want to pee...
Oh and I turned into a fully aired balloon... I now fart and belch with every step I take... This is very musical but not at all elegant! It only appears useful when someone refuses to give me their seat in the subway because then I can turn on my chemical-fart-attack on them...

And making love has became a gymnastic excercice of stretching, bending and folding body parts that shouldn't need bending... I only used to stretch, fold and bend when testing Kamasutric positions, now I do it to protect my unborn child...

Life's not funny today...

HUG ME!!"

I'm so bloody bored!!!!! I can't do half the things I do normally... Biking, movies, walking, go dancing, see friends... it's all a drag.
I used to do five different things in one afternoon, now I get tired only thinking about taking the subway to Paris...

But the appartment is VERY neat!! The ironing is done, the cats fed, the bathroom cleaned twice,... I'm sure I'll become the french/belgian version of Martha Stewart if something doesn't happen quickly. I thought about sewing or knitting and I spend most of my days on the net looking for washable diapers... I have never posted this many on my LJ as the last couple of weeks...

And I only just entered my sixth month... I'm just getting started being a fat-assed whale who heaves when taking the stairs... And then, the child has to be born and then it really starts... The family life... the fear... the horror... the panick...

Pray for me sisters! Pray for me to remain me! Even with child I will be moving, dancing, biking and having the time of my life!!!

And if I turn out to be a genuine child bitch... please! PLEASE!! Come and put me out of my misery, ok?"

"event","We've found the perfect stroller!!! AND WE WANT IT!!!!<br />It's the Xplory from Stokke and it ROOOOXXX!!!!!<br /><br />It looks like a real transformer and we're going to name it Megatron if we can find it. <br /><br />The best thing about it, is that it lifts up the baby so high that she won't be inhaling the fumes from the heavily polluted Paris cars and that we won't break our backs taking her out. This is one of many reason to buy this thing. Another reasons are that it's compact, easily foldable and that it JUST PLAINLY ROOOOOX!!!!!<br /><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.stokke.com/Images/380x380/xplory_01_380x380.gif"" alt="""" /><br /><br />So now we are trying to find it in an affordable way, meaning I won't need to sell my child in order to have this stroller. If you run accross someone who has this WEEHAAA thing, please think of us!! We're doing Ebay, French, Belgian and Dutch websites but if you have any ideas on how to get this thing cheap, you will be worshipped forever :)<br />Oh, and Russel Crowe has the same stroller, now isn't that reason enough (MWAHAHAHAHAHA, just kidding ^^)<br /><br />(just for info: this is the only thing we are prepared to pay money for. All the rest will be hand-me-down, second-hand or flea-market material. We are NOT rich)<br /><br />Ok, other fat belly things<br /><br />I've been reading books, and websites, and blogs and I am now the most highly informed mother-to-be on earth. I know everything I need to know about nipples, uterus, diapers and baby sleep. And what does that give me? <br />Right... it gives me panick attacks...<br /><br />The only thing I am now convinced about is the fact that I don't know shit. I just don't know how to feed my child (on demand or on schedule, breast or bottle), how it is to give birth (at home or at the clinic, with or without drugs), how do you carry this thing (stroller, pram, carrying scarfy thing)... I don't know shit... I feel a total nitwit about nothing and everything. There is so much to know and to do to be the perfect mom!!! HOW AM I GOING TO MANAGE THIS???!!!<br />It seems so easy in the books but is it going to be this natural and this easy or are they just holding up a ""life is beautiful""-speech to sell more books and produce more babies?<br /><br />Is breastfeeding going to hurt? Am I going to poo during labour? Will I be able to trust le boyfriend enough? Will I be able to develop a healthy, structured life for this baby girl? How will I manage being separated from the outside world for two months? How will it be to go back to work afterwards? Will I have a life of my own after birth? Won't I be sad to lose my intimacy with le boyfriend to an very dependant human being? Will le boyfriend help me enough? How will I survive on sleep deprivation? How will we manage financially?<br />However is someone as emotional and sensitive, as unorganised and whimsy as me, who&nbsp; has fought so badly for her independance as I have... how is someone like me EVER going to be a worthwhile mother?<br /><br />Pregnancy is fun when you don't start to think. When you just know what you want, you act upon it and you just enjoy this little wriggling creature in your belly. But once you start to see all the things you must do in order to be a good parent... then the panick starts. Just sheer fright and panick... Everyone is dealing so well, how will I ever get there...<br /><br />Fuck...<br /><br />But luckily, sometimes I find myself again...<br /><br />I started talking with people, instead of reading books and websites. Listening to someone with a PhD on babies is one thing but listening to women who actually HAVE a child and recently gave birth is something totally different. My luck is that my friends &amp; relatives are very open and straightforward so no-one hid the truth. And you know what the truth is?<br /><br />NO ONE KNOWS SHIT!!!!!!<br />EVERYONE IS A NITWIT!!!!!!!<br /><br />How liberating is this thought?<br />Now I know that all these book are perfect, just fabulously perfect for the general child. But every child is different, every parent is different and every baby is different and I'm sure that I could fill my room with books and not having an answer to the specific question I have now. Even worse, I would feel like the worst mother on earth for not knowing the answer to that question... I know myself, I would feel guilty and panicked...<br />But now, I discovered that everyone around me just did it with their instinct. One day at a time and heck... loads of women did it before them, loads of women will do it after them and the purpose is just to survive in the most healthily possible way without hurting anyone physically or psychologically, right? I think I can do that...<br /><br />I think I'm strong enough to give birth and to be a mother. And I am extremely lucky since I can lean on le boyfriend, who's already a father! How's that?!<br /><br />The most scary thing is the loss of control. Now that I know that there is nothing to be done about that, that I will lose control over my body during childbirth and that I will not be the number one in charge of my days anymore for the first few weeks/months... I think I will be able to cope. <br />Everyone I talked about was so honest! It's great to know that they all felt like me and that it's just plain normal not to know a darn thing about it. I'll manage just fine with the people around me, with my mister boyfriend and er... you know what? I'll manage just fine with myself I think ^^<br /><br />I'm much more than I give myself credit for. I'm strong, I'm organised, since I left the roommate (brrrr), my life got really on track and I discovered (to my surprise) that I actually have a pretty well organised life. My home is great and well kept, my cats are so very well treated (says the vet) and I have never had a better relationship than the one with le boyfriend right now. My biggest problem nowadays is my loss of sleep. Oh yes and the fact that I'm pregnant one year earlier than we'd wanted to ^^""<br /><br />I'm no more stupid than the girl next door am I? So... let's just wrap that kid in bubblewrap and wish for the best :D"

"event","I'm loving evey part of the being pregnant-thing ^^
When le boyfriend and I do the pillow talk, she's moving towards his voice, it's so funny! You can actually see my belly move towards him, it's amazing! And last week, le boyfriend saw the shape of my belly change about four or five times in half an hour.

I bought my first maternity pants. Goodness!! I look better and the baby-girl is hopsing much more happily in my belly. These maternity pants give just enough support to be decently dressed but do not squish the baby. Walking feels like dancing wih the baby ^^
However, dressing yourself being pregnant should be an Olympic discipline!! Good gracious it's just impossible to wear socks, tie shoes or even pick up a kitten when pregnant. Please believe me when I tell you that I was very scared, last time I tied my shoes, that I would vomit my own baby!!

Oh and the name-game has started. Baby-girl sometimes moves when we say one name or another, and according to me it's because she LOVES the name, and according to le boyfriend it's because she hates it :D Go figure...

The only thing is that I'm kinda fed up of people telling me how to act, what to do and who I'm supposed to be during this pregnancy. This child is mine, she is ours and not that of someone else. 

Friends of mine are allowed an opinion about my belly, my giving birth or the way we are going to raise our child. Friends are concerned by us and listen to what we have to say. We communicate with friends.

But next week, I'm going back to work, to the outside world, where everyone has an opinion about ""how low I'm carrying"", ""how irresponsible and dangerous I am to give birth in my own darn living room"" and ""how silly I am about merely thinking of using non-disposable diapers"". This is MY fucking mind, MY fucking belly and OUR honey baby so back off!

Opinions are allowed, as long as they ar reasonable and as long as ours are respected as well. I'm not judging someone else on her choice of giving birth in a hospital, don't judge me about wanting to breastfeed just because ""you know better""."

It's anonymous (act of bravery) and it says funny things like ""you talk a lot but don't SAY much"" (well... du-uh!) and something about me winning over my ex being stupid (welcome to human behaviour ^^).

"event","It is always a bad idea...

... to go to the midwife when laundry day, because then, the midwife (who, of COURSE, is a man), sees you in panties with ""squeeze me"" written all over your butt

It is also a bad idea to eat at Mc Donalds before a meeting, especially when wearing white clothes and eating ketchup...

And it is utterly a bad idea to go out ""get something from the car out front"" at your brothers place. Especially when wearing nothing else but an ugly mickey-mouse nightgown just long enough to cover your mini-thong. Especially when you find the ""thing from the car"" you need at the worst of time, being when the motion-detector-lamp switches on and you are hanging with your thonged butt out of the car while a truck is driving by...

HONK HONK!!!

Sometimes these things are just a bad idea...

Edit:
I just discovered that it is a VERY bad idea to go to the vet on a Tuesday afternoon. Apparently, on Tuesday afternoons, the waiting room is just packed with old ladies and their dogs. And these dogs are either small yapping dogs or huge barking dogs. Both of the types are cat-hating dogs.
And of course... the thing you thought bringing in is a kitten of three months...

MAYHEEEEEM!!!!

These are my wishes but I do not know how to make them come true.
I don't even know how to organise a household!!

Right now I wish to clean the baby's room, make it a safe haven for her. This, I can do.
I also want to have a good everyday life. Does someone know how to deal with this latter? How do I organise a living, how do I plan the cooking, what do I need to buy and have in my fridge, how do we organise our life financially? How to survive a child while giving time to me, to our relationship, to her, whilst not forgetting my kitties?

"event","I'm four months pregnant now. End of next month we'll know the sex of the baby but in the meantime I've got lots of (un)interesting stuff to tell.

First of all, we've found ourselves a midwife. I'm almost convinced that she's going to accompany the childbirth. I still have some minor doubts but they are just minor. What's wonderful about her is that she works at a clinic not that far away from our appartment. So all the panick calls from everyone about ""aaargh you'll never get into a hospital/maternity/clinic to give birth, they are all overbooked, I'd kill myself right now if I were you"" were unnecessary. 
Some things could make me change my mind about giving birth at home: 
1. not having a baththub at home... and of course, they do have a baththub at the clinic
2. one of her colleagues does the haptonomy-thing, which is something I want to pursue.
3. this appartment is not MY place, it's rented, it's not in Belgium,... dunno
So it's good to know I'm safely enroled in a maternity clinic and to know I've got more than one option. 

Then there's the very nice ""humiliate the pregnant woman""-game. 
At the movies, when there's a premiere, as soon as the doors open, there's quite some pushing and shoving. I'm ok with that except my belly disagrees with this pushing & shoving. So I tryed to cut the waiting line. I went to the front and asked if it was ok if I got in before everyone else, with my friend. 
""Why would you be going first?""
""Well, I'm pregnant""
""That doesn't make you a handicapped"" 
""Excuse me?""
""You're not handicapped!""
""No I'm not, there's a name for what I am and that is ""pregnant"". And if you'd like to give me your name, I'll go straight to your boss telling him how you treat pregnant women. You know, the same pregnant women who buy tickets that add up to your salary. So either you let me in, either you get reprimanded by your boss.""
So he let us in...

You'll note he's not only rude to pregnant women but also to disabled people, calling them ""handicapped"". Nice huh?
BTW, the movie made up for it. Please, all go see ""Persepolis""!!

The second humiliating moment was at the local mall-supermarket (Carrefour).
We decide to take the priority-waiting line (you know, the least accessible one, the one far away from entrance and exit) to pay. Not that it's quicker, there's an equally long waiting line, but it is less crowded and noisy. So the lady at the cash register turns to us and yells ""Do you have a priority card?""
I was a bit surprised and asked her if I needed a priority card for my pregnancy (because in Belgium, in some situations, you do). After which she replies ""no you can't be here, this cashier is only for perceptible pregnancies, you don't show enough that you're pregnant so please go to another cash register."" 
You want to know something? I started to turn around for another cash register... I'm four months pregnant and it is true it doesn't show as much as some. Maybe because I'm not that large to begin with, maybe because the clothes I was wearing didn't show my belly much, but you can see that I'm pregnant. 
I felt judged, scanned like a piece of meat and humiliated in front of people I don't even know. So I turned away. Only there was another pregnant lady in front of me saying ""don't you DARE go to another cash register!""
Le boyfriend was boiling, the woman behind me was boiling, everyone was outraged. Not because she asked me a disabled/priority card but because she questioned the fact that I was pregnant.

Once we arrived at the cash register, I was a bit naughty and asked her ""is it ok? Am I fat enough for your cash register now?"" after which she started arguing again ""yes well it is my job to ask you for your disabled card and I don't want to discuss this any longer and I'm entitled to question what you tell me and yadda yadda yadda"". 
I did wish her a good day afterwards and didn't even got a ""thank you"" or nothing. 
I understand that it's Saturday afternoon, first day of the sales period. I understand that she has a crappy job at a cash register. But to me, that is no reason to be rude to people who, once again, pay for their job.
So this time I went to complain to her boss. And you know what? There was another pregnant lady (yup, France is THE pregnant country ^^) listening to me and saying that she has had the exact same problem with the exact same person. So there you go, the gal's a bitch!!!

Fuck... From what I hear from colleague pregnant women, I'm not done being judged, put down, reprimanded and even slapped at... Yay...

Oh, and the midwife did talk to me about the high level of sadism during pregnancy and it is true. Not only do I hear I should not complain, be happy and just shut the fuck up, but I also have the huge delight of hearing all kinds of horror stories about C-sections, miscarriages, episiotomies going wrong, abortion, disabled children, 48-hours-deliveries, bloodloss, sleep depravation and other gory stories. No-one ever talks about how great it is to be pregant, because it IS! I'm having fun carrying this little someone, singing to it, making it listen to Blondie, showering with it, feeling the wind, walking along the river with it, fantasizing about it,... it's really nice. And all is going for the best!!! 
The midwife told me to stop listen to these sadists, she told me ""as long as nothing is going wrong, everything is going right"", which is a very reassuring thought!!! Nothing has gone bad except the minds of these gore-people.

So let's get to business and keep having fun with my baby ^^ 

End of the blabla!"

"event","Sometimes being pregnant can give you real fun days ^^

1. The belly does get the gorgeous guy to like me!

I put on the sexy dress some days ago. The one I still fit in and in which my ass doesn't have the size of Flanders. So in the sexy dress, you can see my pregnant belly (I'm only three months and a half now). But the very good news is I still soooooooo rock in the sexy dress.
I wanted to get on the subway, which is an adventure by itself, but wich can be torture being pregnant (even in the early months). The subway arrives and the doors open. Aaah, it's a good subway: one filled with men in suits. Smiiile!!
All seven men, yup, all seven of them had a similar behavioral pattern:
1. look at my boobs
2. look at my belly
3. get out of their seat as fast as their legs can bear in order to be the knight in shining armour and help the sexy pregnant gal

Yay!!! This is fun!!!

So actually I was a little embarrassed by all these gorgeous suit-guys getting up for me so the only thing I could do was becoming red and mumbling some ""haha it's ok, hmmm hmmm heheh grumpf"" while going to the back of the subway.
But then, some stations later, some of the men had to get off the subway. So, since I had some minor belly-ache, and since it is hard on my belly to stand up in a moving object, I decided to grab hold of a freshly emptied seat. But No-Hooo! There was this blond bimbo girl who pushed me to get the only free seat available.

Sigh...

The funny part is that she started flirting with all the guys around. Only, the guys around (still being weehaa cute), saw all that happened and gave her a look of profound ""tut-tut-tut, shame on you, stealing the seat from underneath a pregnant woman's fat ass"" (you know, the condescendent look for her, the admiring look for moi, fighting subways while carrying the secret of life). The blonde bimbo tried to look arrogant and tried ignoring the looks but only looked flaming red and very uncomfortably guilty.

It gave me a big smile for the rest of the day.

2. Pregnant belly makes me travel in time

The Harry Potter train. I like Harry Potter. It's a readable book with some good stuff. I'm not a fan of it because I don't think it's very original and because I dislike the fuzz & buzz they make about it. It doesn't deserve that much noise. Roald Dahl did, Antony Horowitz did, but not Rowling. But anyhew, the Harry Potter train came to Paris. I went to have a look at it with a colleague, see if I could meet up some costumed friends.
Well... ermmmm... there was a two hour waiting line only to get on the train!!! Grrrr... I'm not the waiting line girl. Especially for something like... Hm... No, I'm not the waiting line girl. So after a few phonecalls with the friends and after a discourageing phonecall with the cousin, we wanted to leave. Just at that time, the doors opened again and this guy shouted: ""YOU, THE PREGNANT GAL! TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE!!"".
And there comes the red ""shame on my belle""-face again. But now, two hours was really too long, my colleague is a Harry Potter fan and Kirae had just joined us, feeling quite tired by this story and disappointed about missing her friends as well. So fuck it, in the future, I'll probably be the mummy somewhere in the middle of the waiting line, cursing her kids for liking this shit so this baby owes it to me and my friends to avoid two hours of unnessesary waiting in  my life! 

Yay again!

And btw: the Harry Potter train does not deserve two hours waiting line. The only way you want to go to that train is while being pregnant or while accompanying someone pregant (which is easier, because diaper-free).

Ok, so still happy bouncing around life but now with a bigger belly and bigger arse. Ah well ^^"

"event","Living in France needs quite some adjustment, especially in the medical area. In Belgium, I had this great doctor. She didn't prescribe me loads of medicines and was all about the ""listen to your body""-thing. She rulez!!!

And now here I am in France, every time I need to see a doctor, I change doctors. Everytime they just fill me with pills and blood tests and loads of medical crap that just makes them feel like experts and makes us feel like getting poorer and poorer. 

Fuck them!!
Fuck their wallet!!

You already know I refuse the episiotomy thing, and that I want to give birth at home. This makes it difficult for us to get accepted by doctors and gives us loads of discussions and judgement about how irresponsible and stupid we are.
But this only happens in France though. In Belgium, about everyone I know supports us and there is actually no discussion about it. Except for my over-worried, old-fashioned mother, basically everyone says ""giving birth at home? ok, great! so how about the wheather in Paris?""

The next battle agains the French medical world is the analysis-frenziness. All doctors want me to be tested on a monthly basis for toxoplasmosis, they want me to be tested for the Downs-syndrome and they want me to be tested for diabetes.
These are three tests we don't even DO ANYMORE in Belgium because loads of scientifical information proves that they do more harm to pregnant women and their babies than necessary, considering the odds of these illnesses even to be present!

1. toxoplasmosis
When in France, they discover that you have no antibodies against toxoplasmosis in your blood, the panic starts. First there are MONTHLY blood tests (great for someone like me who has a needle phobia and thus gives that to her child...).
You have to stop eating raw meat for the rest of your pregnancy, along with raw vegetables and mutton. You cannot come near a cat and you definitely have to STOP cleaning its litter. Also, you should avoid getting in contact with young children. You know what? You should lock yourself up in a plastic bubble alltogether!!! 
In Belgium, when they discover you are not immune to toxoplasmosis, they just give you some general advise and then leave it at that. 
About 20% of pregnant women get toxoplasmosis, and it only poses a risk during the first three months of the pregnancy.
Of these 20%, only 5% give it to their unborn child
About 2% of these 5% of 20% get a real problem. The worst problem can be blindness. It has been know that due to toxoplasmosis, a child can have problems in kidneys, blood or liver. Never is this toxoplasmosis putting the life of a child in danger.
So ok, if you can avoid these problems by following some simple rules, you should (and I do). 
But why put all this pressure on pregnant women when you see how low the percentage is of getting a non-lifethreatening disease? Why panic women during a period they should be happy and peaceful?
The first two questions everyone asks me when I'm telling I'm pregnant are the following: are you nauseous and are you immune to toxoplasmosis? First of all: how is this your business? And second of all: what the fuck are you talking about? Questions you should ask me are: are you happy and can I give you my seat? :D

2. Downs-syndrome (trisomie 9, 18, 13 or 21, parmis d'autres)
Up till now, there used to be two tests. First came a blood test and when you were in a high risk group, you had to do a amniocenthesis (yes, HAD, because it's not as if you think you'll be having a choice here, huh? Grease our wallets will ya?).
Fortunately, now, there is a new test, the ""nuchal translucency screening"" which basically means measuring the thickness of the back of the fetus' neck during a sonogram. Talk about low-risk testing!! So the good news is I'm in the very low risk group so you'd think that that's that, no? Well, in Belgium it may be but in France it isn't. ""Just to make sure"", my gyneacologist wanted me to do the blood test. And she insisted on it: ""you HAVE to do the test, and if it's positive, you HAVE to do an amniocenthesis, and if you're at risk, you HAVE to do an abortion"" 
At that point, I was already panicking, crying, shaking and all... Why? Why would I have to do these tests when it appeared I was in a low risk category? And why would I have to end my pregnancy? I have SEEN this baby on a sonogram, I have DREAMT about it, how am I supposed to live with the knowledge of me killing this being in my belly? What if I chose to raise a child with a Downs-syndrome?
In Belgium, this one nuchal test is enough. The second test, being the blood test, gives so many false positives that it is considered as more harmful than anything els! Of all the women doing an amniocenthesis after a positive blood test, 20% LOSE their baby, who - afterwards - appeared to be healthy. And it has been known that women get a positive blood test and then just lose their baby because of the stress they have been through without even doing the amniocenthesis yet!
So I can miss this panic attacls like hell and I'm not doing it.

3. Diabetes
A diabetes test should only be done when the mother has a history of diabetes in her family or if she herself weighed more than 4,5 kilo when she was born. Neither of them are the case for me so fuck their diabetes test.

Conclusion?
I'm leaving the French panic doctors for what they are. I'm going to see my very capable Belgian doctor next month and will be followed up by this new doctor I met who is very favorable for giving birth at home. I'm enroling myself in a maternity hospital about 500 m from my home in case something happens or in case I cannot give birth at home and that is that. No overmedication for me, no invading my body and the body of my baby.

HANDS OFF!!!

Oh, and just so you know? You can judge me, I don't give a fuck ^^ It's my body, our child, and I think I know what's best. And if it has Downs-syndrome, is blind and has diabetes? Well, at least it will be a very very loved child!"

"event","""Heroes"" rocks so! so! SO MUCH!!!

I just love tv-series that hold you literaly on the EDGE of your seat, yelling big reactions like ""NOOOOOOOOO"" (either in a horrified way or in an incredulous way), where you close your eyes while shouting ""BEHIND YOU!!!"" 

Aah!!!

Just GOTTA love it ^^

I've never had this much fun since the early CSI-series.

By the way, if you're looking for another good one, try ""My name is Earl"", in the more funny category."

"event","You see your friends, you take lost American tourist on a Grand Tour in Paris, you sleeeeep, you hold a ""My name is Earl-o-thon"", you watch ""Heroes"" and ""CSI"" while eating healthy food like potato chips, drinking ginger  ale, you feed the cat, you stay in your lazy clothes all day long and you realise that it has been AAAAAGES since you haven't listened to some cool music (Lily Allen & Mika) outside of your mp3-player, which pushes you to start acting silly (still in your lazy clothes and with your (terrified!!) cat as a dancing partner) dancing and singing out loud. GOD THAT FEELS GOOD!!!

And then you tease the cat, you sleep with the cat, you clip your toenails, you pet the cat, you clip his toenails, you read teenage books (the sisterhood of the travelling pants), you do a facial, you die your hair, you think about going out but never go out, you seriously consider cleaning up the place but you never...

"event","Fuck this whole ""ex-friend"" situation. 

To get this straight:
I would be posting in friends-mode if I wasn't sure of these two points:
1/ the person who's not on my friend list anymore will find a way or another to read this post even in secret mode, I want to spare her the trouble of doing like she does all the time
2/ the person in question will use this post to prove her point of me being the manipulative, lying, blablabla (I'm sure she'll lose time nosing through my friends posts again as well, trying to find more ""proof"") and will do so much more if I post in friends only
(basically: post in public = see, Moog's trying to convince the entire world of her being a naughty girl, post in private = see, Moog's trying to manipulate and pervertise all her friends)

Whatever, if she has that much time to lose over it: good for her!

About her opinion (and thus the opinion she is sending into the world ^^ ): it is not true and the best part about that is: everybody know that! 
I am not a bad person. This is the last time I will be talking about this subject, this is even the last time I will be losing my time thinking about this subject. It is 3.00 AM and I am awake thinking only one thing: ""how can someone think such nasty things about someone like me?"". And I just found the answer. The answer is that there is no answer. I am not the nasty person she is telling all that are willing to listen and are weak enough to believe. I am a good person and she is someone with a big problem. All my friends who've heard about this situation came to me and talked about their lives, their loves, their concerns... ah and yes... they also talked about: ""haha on the whole ex-friend stuff ^^"". They heard all she had to say & write about it (if they were meant to read it or not :p ), they chuckled about it and well... that was it basically, let's talk about the latest Ocean's Thirteen. That's the thing about friends: they don't need to be convinced about you being a good person since it is already obvious to them.

I'll probably see her again one of these days (or get her on the phone accidentally :D Baka! Baka! ) ah well... At least, it'll give her food to talk again :D
Except for some money, she has given me all that she could. She has given me some new friends (although they are not the ones she thinks they are), she has given me a stepping stone to move to Paris and for that I will be eternally grateful, and she has taught me to trust my gut feeling: if something feels like it's stinking... it probably stinks!

But I want to get some things straight. I am proud of who I am. I have no secrets, I adore how I dress, I am proud of all the men I have slept with, I seriously think I am blessed by life, I have style and class, my life is pretty fucking damn great (even when not sleeping at 3 AM :D ) and for the opinion she's having about me: I am impressed about the time, energy and phantasy she had to lose over all of that.

Ah and one more thing:

I AM A GODDESS
(there, now she is right: I really wrote it down at least one time in my LJ :D   )

So 3 AM gives you plenty of time to sit and think. Do affirmations, look to inspiring mini-movies (thank you T ^^), pet the cat... and set things right.
I am pregnant. This is what I have been wanting for a long time. It was not on the program this early but here we are. I am ready for this, and I know what I want. But I'm being le bitch to le boyfriend. I am so freaking scared of being in a longterm relationship and losing myself in the process that I refuse him loads of things he more than deserves. It will take time and I am getting there but I hope he is patient with me.

The biggest thing I have lost so far is Trust. Trust in myself and trust in life. I think tonight I found it back but goodness, it was a close call! I have made a whole lot of affirmations and they are good, and they are true. I like them a lot because they are very honest.

Someone posted on her LJ: ""if you know how to be single... congratulations, I don't know how to do it!"". You want to know something? Nobody knows! All people I know who are single think that one big part of their happiness will be instantly realised as soon as they will be with somebody. And you know what? It probably is! But I have to add one question to that: ""if you know how to create your own and your partner's happiness in a relationship... congratulations, I don't know how to do it!"". I have never had a good, healthy longterm relationship so it's a bit logical that I'm flipping when a new longterm relationship is presenting itself. And by the way. When you look around you: how many healthy, sincerely happy relationships do you see? How many relationships are genuinely good ones? How many have not been built on the stones of ""I don't want to be alone?""
I'm doing all in my power to make ours a GOOD one! I already know I'm asking the right questions and working on the good riddles.
I long to make him happy, I long to be happy myself, but Hell: how does this work? Where's the manual for this man? Where's the manual for us together? And by the way: I also kinda lost the manual for myself!

No wonder I have lost the manual... In six months I have found a fabulous guy, I have moved to a very nrw neighborhood surrounded with nature again, I got rid of a toxic friendship, I renegociated my job and got pregnant. Hello!!"

"event","I forgot to tell you about the great wedding we went to! The marriage of Rincewind in a little church in the dunes on Flander's coast. Wonderfull! I had a great time but ate too much ^^
The happiness of the couple is irritating! They look so good together!
You can't help but envy them ^^

The celebration was in Dutch and le boyfriend doesn't speak any Dutch so I translated the entire mess in French simultanously... Sigh... Then we went for a walk along the coast, so so sooo great! Then some shopping and on to the wedding party. We ate like Gods and met some real nice people. Everything was just perfect! I do wish them all the happiness in the world. They do deserve it and they are just so lovable!! Argh!!!

The peace and quiet went on last Monday, Easter Monday, picknick time! And since now is a period where I feel so good, finally free of loads of heavyweights, I made a wonderful picknick salad, a fruit salad and hamsushi (don't ask ^^). We were so at ease, just lying there in the grass eating, telling jokes, watching other people... 

Good times, people!

And going to the pregnancy again, I feel so blessed right now! Le boyfriend wanted to take part in the pregnancy but him being a man made that kinda difficult ^^""
Luckily there is a way: he's looking up all information about the childbirth and doctors. I know that my choices are not accepted as being the right choices but I honestly don't care. They are based on data, on stories of other women, on studies and on my personal beliefs. I want to give birth at home. I want a childbirth as natural as possible without an episiotomy and epidural shot. There are more than enough means of doing so.
But goodness am I JUDGED for this choice?!! 
About episiotomy alone: it can be necessary in certain cases but is used much too often (certainly in the US!!). It is recommended to use it on less than 10% of first time pregnancies. In France it is used in over 70% of first time pregnancies, which is appauling! The risks of tearing the skin are hightened by the procedure of episiotomy, the bloodloss can be dangerous for a woman during childbirth, the scarring can take over 15 months, wich makes a second childbirth very risky. When you let the future mother take her time to give birth, the vagina expands more than enough to let a child pass. But the problem is that hospitals are in a rush and want childbirths to be productive, so they slice open your vagina in order to let the child out more quickly. yay! Let's mutilate women in order to let the money roll in!! Long live the pharmaceutical companies!
For someone as strongly against female genital mutilation as I am, this comes in count as being one! So fuck off! No-one touches my vagina, and especially not with a KNIFE!!

Let's not even start about childbirth at home and refusing epidurals... I'm a ""bad person"" for even THINKING what I'm thinking... Yay...

But for now I'm fed up with being pregnant so I'm taking a holliday from my pregnancy ^^ I won't be thinking about it or talking about it for some days ^^ Cheers!"

Stop telling her ""well, yes, that's part of being pregnant"", ""it's going to ge a whole lot worse from here on, you know"" or ""if you don't like that, you should've thought of it sooner"" (especially if it's an accident).

No

Just take her in your arms and give her a hug. That's probably the only thing she wants. Compassion and looooaaaads of hugs.

Oh, only... try to hug her before or after she is vomiting, not during!

PS Myself: some nausea, no vomiting yet... yay!
PPS one friend of mine was vomiting so much she was almost afraid she'd vomit the baby out :D"

"event","So here we are, one friendship ruined, some friendships on serious standby, one friendship probably repaired... Tirering...
Just to let all the concerned parties know that I'm no fool, no bitch and no manipulator. I know that, all of the people I have ever been in contact with know that, so all concerned parties know that too. Fuck them!

Oh, lots of people asked me if I would keep a pregnancy blog. Well, I don't think so, I'm not into the pregnancy business. However, I'll continue this blog about my life, and well, I kinda AM pregnant so I'll probably write about it. Knowing me, I'll write too much about it :D

Let's start with the cat. My Pepsi-boy ^^ He's so fun to live with. He used to be very shy but discovers day by day that he has an entire appartment in which he can play. His favourite toys are the same as always: a worn out mouse, and plastic thingies. Sometimes he imagines himself being a wild panter but that doesn't really impress no-one except the neighbours under us who hear all the furniture move :D
He's ever so cuddly, he even sleeps in our bed! That can be a problem since he's purring all night long and keeping us awake with a vibrating bed (yes, I do know that the idea of a vibrating bed can be interesting ^^). By the way, I never knew a cat could take more space than a human being in bed... =.=
Anyways, he still misses his brother, sadly. And he does hate closed doors. He can sit in front of a closed door until you open it, just to turn around, reassured... ""phew; the door is open!""
I'm amazed at the amount of food he eats! He now only eats healthy dry fod and his body weight has changed significantly. In a positive way ^^

NIAW!!

Oh and we have a HUGE amount of television channels now. And you wouldn't believe it but the more channels you've got, the less interesting television becomes! I especially like ZEE-tv, the Indian soap channel and Al Jazeera Children, where I'm still waiting for a kill-George-Bush cartoon show...

I believe this post is turning out quite uninteresting but what the heck, I'm having a relaxing Saturday morning cleaning the flat and strolling on the computer so I don't give a damn ^^

So the belly is ok. I'm only annoyed at all the people around me who push me into being this ""happy-yay-yay-mommy""-thing, which is absolutely not my thing. I'm happy, I feel blessed and content because I feel that my life is getting better and better each day. But the pregnancy I have is like any other: it's freaky! Actually, all women I have talked about told me that they freaked out BIG TIME during their pregnancy and none of them felt like they were entitled to. As soon as they began speaking about their fears, their doubts and their concerns, everyone shut them up with a ""yes but you're having a baby, just forget about the rest, isn't it wonderful? Hallmark!! Hallmark!!"". So they kept all their concerns tucked away deeply inside their souls and the result was that they got a huge babyblues or even a postnatal depression.
A pregnancy is about happiness and sadness, about being glad and being scared. I can only assume this is normal. The positive aspects of pregnancy are over-accentuated but I don't want to forget the negative aspects of it. 
For instance, I could just sit in a park for hours just looking at people passing by, at the trees leafing, at kids playing, whatever, just being happy with my tiny tiny babybelly. But on the other hand, I feel the changes in me. I feel myself becoming someone else, my instincts change, my body changes,... all of it. I feel like losing my ME. I think the mother me will be someone entirely different than the me I am now and I have to deal with these two people now. 
There is someone new I want to welcome with my arms wide open. She looks interesting to get to know ^^.
But there is someone old that I have to say goodbye to. I'll miss her and I'll mourn her.
I'm already enjoying my body as much as possible for now. I'm trying on all my clothes I can still fit in for the moment, all the clothes I loooove to wear but will become too small in the future. I'm walking on high heels (goodness I'll miss that!!) as much as possible. I want to take nude pictures before my belly shows, I have to say goodbye to all of this.
I know I'll get something big instead but I do not want to neglect the things that will cease to exist in my life.

I feel also closely confronted to myself. The boyfriend gets sad about it because I cannot find all the words necessary to discribe all my physical & psychological feelings (if he could, he'd be pregnant in my place ^^). I just read something that makes a LOT of sense to me right now. It's an African proverb: 
""Being pregnant and giving birth are like crossing a narrow bridge. People can accompany you to the bridge. They can greet you on the other side. But you walk that bridge alone.""

But luckily, he is here ^^
Life has given us this situation and we're dealing with it together. That also is something new to me. Someone to live together with. To share with, to help, to be helped by. To listen to and to be listened by. Goodness I feel lucky to be where I am now!

I feel as complete as I never have felt before!

Love and gratitude!"

haven't used this one in a while and i felt like bitching, so this is a rant post

k, why is it that some people, when you lend them money, even if it is just a quarter, they minute they get a quarter in their possession they will run you down and make sure they give it to you.  and why the HELL is it that there are people out there who make the LENDER track them down?  when the lender/borrower are friends.

normally, i trust people.  but i had candice owing me over 100 for over a year, i ended up saying forget the ten bucks to colin for the social and since erin has written off everyone on lj and i have no clue what his number is, i'm writin off the ten bucks that HE still owes me for the social.  and then there is mandy.  almost two years and still 600 fucking dollars.  k, here is what i don't understand.  all she has to do is STOP BY MY HOUSE ON THE WAY TO WORK.  it isn't a detour or at the least it is barely one.  and yet she makes me call her continuously and make plans with her that never end up happening just so i can MAYBE get some cash from her.  i'm frustrated as all hell.  it's not like i'm demanding all 600 at once, but she has continuously told me dates that i'll be paid back on and they never come to pass.  i'm going to her work tonight. she told me she was working at 9.  it's her pay day today.  i'm going to start screaming at her if a)she's not at work or b)she had no money.

erg.

so new rules: never ask to borrow money adn if i am ever stupid enough to offer, don't accept.  be a friend not a source of extreme anger.

erg.  mandy and i should have drifted apart long ago but i am forced to continue to have contact with her because i am not giving up on that 600.  that pays for the two courses that i need to take in january.  i have 400 for books in the bank so even if i don't get a job i'm alright so long as mandy comes through, but i've been saying that for over 18 months so now what?

sometimes i wish i still was dating jon, then i could use him to break the bitch's legs.  or stab her :P

i'm so happy that gates is so good about me being the way i am.  i'm getting extremely bitchy about not being employed.  mostly i'm so annoyed because i plan stuff and then other shit comes up that wouldn't happen if i wasn't dating gates.  he has too many obligations to friends.  and now i looked at next weekend and it is THANKS-FUCKING-GIVING.  which means my plans to go to suneil's party and then take the weekend ""off"" are shot.  plus there is a bomber game on my 9 month which means that yet again gates will not bother to really go to any lengths.  i don't mind so much because i understand that he doesn't find one month a huge accomplishment, but i used to be so gung-ho about ""anniversaries"". last month we didn't do anything either.  he doesn't even get me flowers.  he ""thought about it"".  real romantic asshole. 

erg.   whatever.  i am here too much but really, i don't like being at home and if i go to school i have to go to all the trouble of packing a lunch cuz i ain't buying food.  plus i get to bake here.  i'm baking bread.  blah to eveything

"event","i can't wait!  next week i go to school.  yay!

something to focus on other thanwork and my bf.

things are going to be different now i think.  there is the very real possibility that i will only see my bf socially one day a week, and that i may only talk to him two or three other days.  i'm refusing to see him every day at work.  that's too much and way too suspicious.  

and i'd get very frustrated if i saw him everyday but was unable to touch him or be myself because i was at work.

i think this time apart will be beneficial, but i'm also a teeny bit worried.  i mean, what happens if he decides he doesn't need me around at all, not just barely?

and i guess i'm starting to worry that i don't really want him around much either.  i haven't seen him since tuesday, and yes part of the reason i've been so happy lately is that he was so good that day (for him) but mostly it's that i've been away from work and finding myself again.  i feel more myself than i have in months.  and i became someone i really didn't like while i was spending a lot of time with jon.  now that i've switched back i don't know if that will attract him or send him running, but i've got a backbone again so it's all good.


i'm looking forward to time apart, thinking that our time together will be that much more special, but what if it isnt'?  what if, after telling him that he can see me on either sat/sun, whichever he'd like, he goes and decides to hang out with his friends both those days.  what am i supposed to think then?

but that's a ways away.  who knows?  i could become blissfully happy with the new arrangement  not likely, but possible i guess.

i think i'm healthier than i've been in a while, i'm focusing on me, and my life, not so much the things in my life.  and i've made it two days in a row of very heavy home workout.  i'm even imagining some abs on my tummy !

anyhoo, my room is clean.  i FINALLY figured out how to set up my freaking bed frame, it only took me a year!  fuck i felt dumb.  oh well, now it won't break all the time now.  hopefullly.

i have even organized my desk for my three classes.  i'm ready to go, just one more week!  I'm really looking forward to it, kinda looking at it as the start of my life, for real this time. last year was a joke, it wasn't even kewl.

oh well, no regrets.  

may i just say that monistat is the grossest thing imaginable and i urge all people to avoid yeast infections like the plague.  that is all

"event","what the hell.  my sleep patterns are fucked up. 

thursday nite, slept.  i had the day off, i ended up sleeping a lot because i needed it.  when i say a lot, i mean until around 1030, then again 1-3.  then i slept at about 12, til 4.  

friday i went to work, the library  the bank, registered for classes went to meet colin, went home went out with jon.  was out til 1am.  couldn't sleep til like, 230.  woke up at 4.

when i got home at 9 this morning after going home ""sick"" (female problems) i didn't go to sleep.  i wen tout and started digging up weedes and the sidewalk out front, then i cut the grass and it STARTED RAINING.  wtf.


anyway.


i'm supposed to go to a show today bu ti won't.

i slept from 12 til about 3, then 445 til 7.  so i'm feeling a bit better.  i was in a shitty grumpy mood last nite and pissed off at jon.

went to buy a stereo, he tries to get me to buy this 400 jvc stereo,the most powerful in future shop.  um, i don't need the most powerful piece of shit out there.  i didn't like it at first glance.  done. no thanks. but then he has to go on and on with the salesperson about how great it is.  and  how i don't want to spend the money on it, and about how i'm a ""chick"" so i only care about how it looks.  then since that was out of stock, he starts talking to the salesperson about car stereo systems.  

i am fine with THIS.  i'll wait around for a half hour as he blathers on and i'll smile and nod.

then we go out to the car and he's like, ohhhhh did i spend too long talking?  all mocking and all. so i'm like, oh well, whatever.

neither of us are tired, we go to the forks.

he makes some completely chauvinistic comment about some ladies' man buying her a bike. in other words, he's got excess stupid hormones in his system.

we're down by the river and the wind is cold.  so i say, i'll trade you spots.  he's got jeans on, i've got shorts and  a tank.  he's also immune to cold and in fact, likes it.  i want him to go into the wind so it'll be blocked from me.

""cold?""

""yeah.""

""just tell yourself you're warm""


a few minutes later he tells me that his ass is sore from the rock so i say ""just tell yourself it's soft""


i wanted to go further down the path cuz a train went by and it was loud and annoyed me and i was getting a headache.  he says no.  it'll be gone soon.

then it gets high pitched and HE wants to leave so i refuse and it fucking is gone right after.

so then he's like, why don't you tell me when you're mad?  you get all sarcastic.  then he's telling me how i feel.  saying a bunch of shit.

so why is it that when we're completely alone he's good?  when any other people talk to us, he becomes an arrogant chauvinistic prick?
at least it's only with friends that i become a jerk to him, but he hates all my friends so we don't go out with them so that's done.  he talks to ANYONE and he starts treating me like some blonde village idiot.  he has no respect for me. 


and tomorrow i'll love him.  IF he shows up for the meteor shower, i have a feeling he's gonna ditch on me.  then it's done.  unless he does some crawling but he's too damn stubborn and proud to even apologize when it matters.

anyway, there's my little pet peeve for the day.

dropped my calc and my stats, i heard that the stats exam was killer.  glad i didn't waste time studying for it :P

so um, yeahhhh... iunno, jaime keeps calling me, kinda annoying but nice to have phone calls while i'm sick off my ass.  something to do.  

stupid drug ain't working, was hoping to conk out but it ain't working.  oh well.  maybe later.

took my sociology test today.  bad.  very bad.  but i'll make it up i'm sure in the next one, while i go to every class.  yesssss, every class.

i'm tempted to drop economics and take it in summer session, but i'm not sure. if i get a c i'll be fine, but if i don't, i don't know if i'll be able to register for it.  i need it by the end of june and there are two sections only.  i'm sure they'll fill up fast and i'm not sure if i can register while i'm still in it in regular session.  iunno.  i'll talk to someone or other about it.  waste of money if i do though.  who knows.


i waste a lot of money. go me.
thinking of leasing a car.  better than a loan, i don't want a loan.

iunno.  whatever.  i'll live unfortunately.

hey colin, remember, 9:30 thursday, CALL ME.  lolo
maybe earlier.  heh.  i'm gonna blow him off, we all know it.  well, we both know it.  c'mon, 28 and not even cute.  lolo.  at least darren was cute.  i should've called darren.  fuck the age difference.  oh well, my one regret over the summer :P  

erg, summer is approaching.  not looking forward to it, have to work my ass off.  and stuff.  bleah.

whatever.  my mom is anoying, she's now pressuring me to get a  car.  she expects me to be her damn bitch once i get one.  and yet, no help on payments/insurance/anything is offered.  fuck that noise.  christ she annoys me. 

oh lookee, it's colin, hi colin, i'm gonna go talk to you now

"event","well, i call up chris because to do otherwise would have made me a liar and a hypocrite.  i want him.  and i've always said, if there's anything i want bad enough then i will work my ass off to get it.  and no, i don't just mean physically want him.  

so i called him up, and there was NO ANSWER.  the desire in me was strong to take this as a fortunate intercession on Fate's part to spare me abject humiliation.  

BUT, being the glutton for punishment i am, i called him again an hour or two later and he was in the shower.  by this time you can tell i'm getting all ohhhhh shite.  but  he calls me back.

so, we chat a minute or so all ""why are you calling me and being normal after two weeks of silence"" type of awkwardness going on and then HE asks ME.  why haven't you called me in the last while?


fucking hell..... talk about being stupid.  never go out with someone just like you, it DOESN'T work.  well, it does, but it is just exasperating as all hell! :D

so yes, everything is normal.  is anyone else gettng the feeling that this situation is going to last a lot longer than may?  (when i said i'd probably be done with it, or him with me, etc.)  weird.  whatever.


anyway, go to mike's and pick up mike, who has a delicious orange juice concoction with him and is quite hilarious due to it's effects.  then pick up his friend chris.  drive them to the beach.  we go to coyote's.

we've been standing in line for about 15 minutes when mike calls me, they got kicked out.  so i'm like, mandy let's go pick them up, and she says no, tell them to come to coyote's.  so i felt bad but in truth, i didn't want to leave after standing in line so long either.  but mike and chris bussed it home so i do feel bad.  but hell, we all know i'm a bitch so i soon got over it.

we danced (well, vicki and i danced a lot, mandy not a lot because well, she was usually holding the drinks)  what kind of stupid bar doesn't allow drinks on the dance floor?!?  erg.  very annoying, ended up chugging a couple of beer to dance to good songs.  heh.  made the nite interesting though.

fleshtone rockets were playing and they surprised me by not mangling any good songs and thus being awesome! :P

so drank a bit, and then some guy was talking me up, and he offered to buy me a drink so i went with him to the bar, but on the way, i fell a couple of steps behind and this guy and his friend stopped me and said hello.  i laughed because the guy i was with (i can't for the life of me remember his name) came to stand beside me and the guy who had stopped me (the really drunk one) was all, ohhhhh, but his friend STILL tried to talk to me, so i was like, byeeeee!!


got my drink, followed guy back to where the girls were, then went to dance, came back and the guy was gone.  see, if you ask me, are you going to be here when i get back?  i will say yes, but the question annoys me so i'll wander off.  and i did.  and then the friend of the really drunk guy found me and was like, i saw you dancing earlier on the platform, i thought you were really cute.  why were you with that guy?  he's not for you.  and i was laughing inside and being nice outside, it was sooo funny!  i've never been pursued quite like that before.

so the guy tries to get me to go with him and i'm like, no you're a stranger.  and then after chatting me up and dancing and trying to kiss my neck, he asks me, ""i take it you don't have a bf?""  and i get annoyed so i'm like.  oh of course i do.  he didn't believe me.  but whatever! :P

so i eventually had to give him my number to get him to go away and whenever he's back in wpg he'll call me up.  lolo.  stupid guy.

though i think i tolerated him because he reminded me of someone else.  superficial resemblence but still, hey, i'm obsessed so what do you xpect?!


so that was the nite, and mandy picked up a guy who was okay, he seemed pretty smooth though he happened to be 28.  :S


and that was that, and tonite i'll be doing something or tother possibly do the whole movie thing, you never know

a) floral arranger/designer

b) used book store postition

c) part time receptionist at a chiro office

i'm gonna drop off/ mail resumes out tomorrow.  gosh how i hate the fact that i can't just call in sick and say, sorry joe, no work for me today, and then of course, go job hunting.  ironic eh?

i'm excited, i really really REALLY want a change.  oh gosh!  whatever shall i wear tomorrow?  oh gosh!  i also have my driving lesson!  oh gosh!  i think i should celebrate.......

hmmm, i shall think on it.


so yeah, it's weird how many familiar faces i saw while i was on the bus and they weren't.  i saw stephen, david and two other guys i should prol know their names, i saw marvin, that guy i always saw around daniel, and... yeah, that's it today.

i also saw ryan on campus, but we just smiled and nodded.  ryan has a really good smile, i never really noticed, it's infectious, y'know.  that's ryan macatangay by the way.

and andrew was nice enough to allow me to use him as a reference, made up some bullshit story about volunteering with him.  at general.  (he went to cecil)

anyway, i figure if i can always catch my buses on time after last class on m/w/f, i can devote more time to driving, thus like, from 230-330, then get dropped off at work.  cuz i get home at like, 215ish, so it could work.....  then i would be able to take the road test in a couple of weeks instead of the month or so i gave myself (if they have openings...)
so i also have to pick up my road test reciept.  fucking expensive shit this driving is, but i still want my car!

anyway, yeah, how much is a road test anyway?  60.00?
and what do i have to do to insure my car once i get it?
and what other exorbent amounts of coin do i need to spend on the damn thing?

hee hee.

so yeah. i figure i can work 23.........why the hell did i figure 23?  i should have figured 30 hours per week, not 23.  okay, so i will have lots more money than i currently thought i would.  so i am soooo quitting mcds.  i want to do it today, but i figure i will see how the other three jobs pan out, if they feel good or not, then i'll go in on wednesday adn be like, oh joe, i forgot to tell you, 

thank you for promoting me two months ago, and thanks everso much for the new name tag, the new uniform and all that training yuou gave me, but well, the thing is... 

I QUIT!!!  

so, as of october...  6th i believe, i no longer work here, sound good?  *pretty lil smile*

that's gonna be soooo fun.  damn, i shoulda quit aeons ago.  just the idea of quitting is making me so cheerful, i was smiling on and off all day.  to STRANGERS.  think the guy on the bus thought i was into him or somthing.  gazing across the aisle and then suddenly grinning at nothing, but wait, it's not nothing because there is a body across from me.  heeh heh he h

well, wish me luck!

heh heh heh.  it'd be kinda funny if i get a job right off the bat.  i mean, after all the people i know have searched lots to find one.  that'd be hilarious, i'd be like, HAH.  i rock!  plus the experience kinda helps, i GUESS. lolo.  but yeah, wish me luck!

i'm sure he's fine.

anyway, god is very bad at doing ordering.  i think i may have to take over and then leave them in chaos when i leave.  i also figure i'll leave at the END of january, not the beginning, that way i can make another grand or so.  well, theoretically.  but i really want to experience something different in the way of a summer job.  it's boring just being an assistant manager at mcds.   i mean sure, it's a respectable position and looks good on a resume, but i am so bored of always doing normal things.  i just want to do something amazing, spectacular, hell, life-threatening if it comes to that.  anybody wanna go bungee jumping?  lol, as if, i'd prol hurl and i hate puking.

anyway, as you can see i am quite awake, should be interesting to see me tomorrow.

i rollerbladed to work today.  my bike lock was cut yesterday, i think becuase i accidently locked my bike to another, but i was SURE i didn't.  oh well.  i am too cheap to buy another lock so i'll just blade and/or walk.  bus is much too expensive.  look!  look!!  i am saving money!!

and then a shark swam up to her adn bit her in half.  the vet wasn't able to fix her. mollie's dog died.

demanding voice
begging analysis

i despair of ever seeing their back
they won't leave
they won't be silent

growing in numbers, filling the page
a pencil their weapon
eraser their mortal enemy

the war is fought on snow white fields
trenches filled with words
the enemy seeks to destroy

littering the ground with forgotten souls
the words are losing
the killing complete

yet the words are always there
biding their sweet time
seeking out those trenches

you can't stop them coming, wave after wave
they roll in
impossible to halt/hinder

i wish they would stop......."

"event","well ppl, megan cried at work.  here's basically what  happened, afterhearing all ppl that day:

friday night, nice megan stays extra half hour to help brenda out cuz she's freaking out and screwed over royally.
at close, brenda decided to leave without doing close, mng or otherwise.  the place looked like shit.
CHRIS - slacker chris even told her they couldn't go because it looked like shit.  
brenda wanted to go to the bar however so she said nope, we're leaving.

sat. morn:
john is late for work, leaving christy by herself for two hours.
lynelle is next person in at quarter to nine.  john shows up around 930, starts basically doing last night's close adn cleaning the place up.
mike is also late for work and shows up around 1140.  he's on window all day, kinda a non-entity if you will.
so, i get in at quarter to 12 (start at 12) to find out all this shit, plus the fact that brenda (the cunt) called in sick. 
christy was, well infuriated, and told her she had to come in 12-5 (supposed to work 9-5).
so i get there and am told that it is gonna be my floor and i am given the safe combo.  christy leaves to pick up her dog.  mandy adn chris are both a bit late, as is the cunt brenda.  

brenda gets on the floor and stands up front.  i ask her to get on til 1, mike is on til 2, lynelle is going on break so mandy is running.  mandy is also sick, losing her voice.  brenda asks mandy to go on til 1, mandy exlplains about her voice, brenda says ""i'm sick too, i don't want to go on til"". then she asks me to go on til 1, mandy looks at me, shakes her head, goes on til 1 and i finish up and go to relieve her.  mandy refuses, stays on til 1.

so, then brenda dissappears.  she's in the back doing last night's mng close.  we ignore her, try to get things done.  the place is crazy and i'm stressing hardcore because basically everything needs to be done, and breaks need to be gotten off.  i hadn't even had a real chance to check the schedule, so as i said, i was stressing.

lynelle comes back from break and we're discussing where to put ppl.  somehow, we both forget that lynelle is on the floor so i ask brenda to run for window.  

she comes out and is like, ""there are enough ppl on the floor.  megan can i get you on window and hakim in the backend.""  really mean and stressed out like.

it's not one'o clock.  hakim starts at one.  then someone says we need ketchup filled in lobby so i call to ask john to go do it (he's cleaning out the back area).  

brenda comes back out and asks ""why isn't anyone listeneing to me??!?  do you guys need me?  or can i leave?""
somewhere in that i told her that it was my floor
anyway, i'm like, fuck this noise, i have enough to deal with without drama queen bitch royale, so very calmly i tell her, ""it's okay, go home.""

she stands there.  john starts singsonging that lobby needs to be checked cuz it's a mess.  i ask him to do it again and he flips on me.  ""blah blah blah, i do soooo much, there are lots of ppl on the floor get someone else to....etc.""
throughout all of this i repeatedly apologize to him all calm like.  john, i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm truly sorry.

fuck!

anyway, brenda dissapears again as does john, i turn to make a wrap and start crying.  i would have been fine but then lynelle came to hug me.  i can't stand ppl being nice to me.  i can' tstop crying when ppl are nice.

so mandy an d lynelle both tell me to go sit down basically get myself together, adn i go to the ladies room.

a few minutes later lynelle comes in and i find out that she tried to get john to apologize to me, he refused he flipped on her, she tried to calm him down, meanwhile swimg manager brenda was all like, he doesn't have to apologize he did blah blah blah

lynelle got upset, also started crying, said i can't deal with this and came to join me.

we calmed down a bit and went back to the restaurant, where brenda told us that we couldn't work til we talked to joe.  we got our stuff and left.  

we talked a bit an dthen we walked over to the main restaurant and talked to vlasta (joe's boss and our actual head mng, joe is acting head).  she was nice, sent us back to work, gave me the floor and had brenda work with her for the day.
after that we got things better at walmart and when erika came in she cut me first chance she got.

that was my saturday.  i think i have to work with brenda on thursday, but i work with joe on tuesday first so who knows what will happen.

sorry it was so long, had to do it this way.  need to get it all straight before joe asks.

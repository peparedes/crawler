"event","It's been a while since I have been on here! I think it's been like a year man! Well I have gone through a lot of phases, gone through some trials a tribulations. I finally realized that my best friend from high school wasn't my best friend at all, but a two faced bitch. It's hard to accept the fact that you were foolish enough to tell all your secrets and let someone know your most personal thoughts. Like that saying goes ""Fool me once shame on you! Fool me twice shame on me"" I did indeed find my true friends, they work with me and they are real and honest. It's weird how your enemies become your best friends and that's what I experienced. I saw one of my friends get married this year. I was in the wedding and it was amazing. I had a great time driving to Monterey with my sister (which is where the wedding was held)! Fuckin A' man, doin 95 mph while bumpin New Kids on the Block, what more can you ask for. And then hearing ""White Wedding"" by Billy idol while the soon the bride was riding in the car was a moment in itself! Crazy fuckin times! The theme song of the wedding ""LEAN BACK"", it was a crazy and fun time. SHIET, before that we were in VEGAS fuckin liven it up! Clubs, Casino's, Chippendales, being drunk off our fuckin ass'! Alcoholics Unite Motha Fucka! Still goin to school, still working for the state, and I have a boyfriend! Different for me. I am always single, but I love him and he's great! Well I guess I am off!"

"event","Well just when I thought I was goin to xhool for nothing I learned that I have an AA in social science and that I will be done soon with getting my AA in JOURNALISM! I am amazed, just when I thought I was pissin my life away it all starts to change. Maybe the Tarrot cards were right, maybe change is in the winds and things will start to change for the better! I need to stop being a HERMIT and be the SOCIAL BUTTERFLY I AM, whatever that means! I think I have been depressed without really knowing it, thinking I am fine and hanging put with friends, when all I really wanted to do was just be alone. I don't know what I am to do anymore, maybe I'll go to the gym, finally get my fuckin license, and move out! I need to get my life straightened out and figure out what kind of person I am. I am responsible, but I am afraid I have lost sight of who I am and wow I really got into this on my journal, something I rarely do. Well enjoy all! GOODNIGHT! <3"

 ""my eyes followed as you walked away and left me cold
i knew that this would happen as soon as i let my guard down
still i wonder where forever can be found.
its far from you, that i know.
and there is only but one eternity that i wish to see as i struggle.
searching for the place where infinity is more to me than just a dream.
someplace where grace heals her wings and envy breathes air to some
dead lungs that will never work again, never bleed again, I wont bleed again.
no. not for you.
but you gave me the key to your heart then changed the locks
if i could trade all of my heavens for one of your hells, i would.
but i guess that wouldnt matter.
im sick of competing, sick of retreating.
i proved you wrong.
regret caved my chest in and i think i mistook pain for pleasure.
nothing is as empty as the places where we used to be.
i stand alone.
our sillouhettes still linger serving only to haunt me.
insomnia has been my best friend.
who needs sleep when dreams only feed lies to the mind
i was always afraid of a death by suffocation, or any kind of slow death for that matter.
but after living through this, i guess that isnt so bad.
or is it?
I tried. Believe me, I tried.
now all is lost, for another time.
this world is cold, for another time.
i just wish that this life would end.
i just wish that this heart would mend.
it won't""

I'm alive... somehow...

Been working on my capstone project this semester. 's crazy. I'm in charge of Aerodynamics, Thermodynamics, and putting the speadsheet together... the first two're the hard parts. Rocket go up, rocket go down. Rocket eat up 6 hours of every day. @_@

I've also got a music class... silly concert reports. Dunno why they're all crammed at the END of the semester, rather than the beginning... so gosh-darn inconvenient... there's a harp recital soon that I hope I can get to. I've always loved harps...

Anyway... must get back to TPS's...

...with any luck I'll be able to get some writing done... eventually... <_<

Really.

I've been playing a bit of World of Warcraft. Funfun there... unfortunately it's not my game, so after... Monday I won't play it anymore. Night Elf Druid, yeahyeah so original I know...

Participating in a forum RP. It's fun. Not much to say there, really.

Hm... well, you can blame that on <a href=""http://s4.invisionfree.com/Captain_SNES/index.php?act=idx"">this forum right here</a>, for eating up all my 'spare' time (and a lot of time that I didn't really have to spare).

"event","<lj-cut text=""Warning, religious rant"">I'm Jewish, but reasonably acquainted with Christianity, mostly because people who know nothing about my religion have been telling me my entire life that I'm Christian. 

I'm not. I'm Messianic, and there's a distinct difference. 

But I am sort of glad that I'm not Christian. The church has been taking a lot of flak, lately, mostly because of rabid 'fundamentalists' who like to use that word because it sounds better than 'bigot' or 'hatemonger'. The real problem is not even the church itself, although it can bear a little bit of the blame. The christians I know who support such heretical ideas such as 'gay rights' and 'separation of church and state' have to deal with that part of their background. Even if people who are anti-gay or whatever are just using the religion slant to get popular support from the idiotic masses and/or to further their plans to make this country a theocracy, liberal christians still have to deal with people telling them that they're being a bad example of their religion (when, in fact, they might believe very deeply) just because they think that everybody is equal in the eyes of god. Or, worse, they have to be ashamed of their religion because of the rampant bad examples out there as of late. I'm more of an agnostic than a Jew at this point, but I think that when someone becomes ashamed of their religion it's a very sad thing, because honestly religion is not an inherently bad thing.

Most people who tell me I'm christian, I think, do so because I don't fit into any of their boxes. We're such a minority that it's like telling a Wiccan that they're pagan when indeed they may not be. They don't really care if they're right or not, and making generalizations stops them from having to think. 

And then the damn christians expect us to know the difference between a Presbyterian and an Anglican. I know that the differences might be significant (I have no idea, actually), but dear god, if you don't know what the difference between and Orthodox and a Hasidic Jew is, don't lecture me when I get Lutherans and Episcopalians confused. About the only ones I know are the Baptists, and that only because the phrase Bapti-dome stuck in my head the first time I heard it. 

(I'm not making that up, either. Apparently in Houston there is a Baptist church that is so massive it resembles a sports stadium. I don't know if the Baptists call it that, but it's a hilarious name, ne?)</lj-cut>

Nyrt. Now I get to finish my homework. Die, homework, die.

"event","It seems that every single day since the election I've heard something really sucky.

Today's tidbit: Iraqi extremists are moving to Iran. Wonderful.

Also: The likelyhood of a draft relatively soon, the continued stupidity of the Federal Marriage Amendment (damn you, bush, for stealing Fullmetal Alchemist's acronym! And for something that evil and asinine, none the less!). 

Grr.

RL is not helping my state of mind. Between class troubles and a mother who won't email be back when I tell her that I can't afford to buy food anymore, I'm feeling wonderfully abandoned by the people who brought me into this world and forced me up into this godforsaken state. 

*ahem*

I've been rewatching Fruits Basket to distract myself from the utter shit that is the world right now. God, that anime's cute. And funny. And painfully shoujo.

Kyou Kara Maou - Funny. Bad, but funny. 22 episodes, so far. 3/5, although I don't like rating shows until they're over.

Bleach - only two episodes in. The first is really cliche, but the second episodes improves the show greatly, I think.

Gankutsuou - two episodes in, and I don't know what kind of anime it's going to be. Good, if you can get used to the weird clothing pattern effect. (and hair. The hair is weirder, on some people, I think.)

Friday:
Make up test in PDE. I did so embarassingly abyssmal on the first one...
Homework due in Astro. My own fault since this is turning it in late, but nyrg.

Sunday:
Meeting with my Design group for the first time. Bastard from Robotics lab is in the group; hopefully he won't end up as team leader and the other people in the group will act as a sort of a buffer. At least we don't have to actually design anything. But we got the most boring project of them all - the plain ol' airplane. Oh well. I sorta wanted the Orinthopter. Or the UFO flying thingie. I'm just glad I didn't get the helicopter or the boomarang... the boomarang scares me, slightly.

In other news, I hope that Bleach can fill the spot of 'anime Mordain follows with a rather frighening obsession'. It's good, if kinda cliche, so far (and 'so far' is episode one). Funny in weird places.

I think I'm gonna skip commenting on FMA 51. I think other people are covering that enough, and better anyway.

In other news: All I want is FMA 51. I don't want some stupid war between fansubbers, I just want the damned episode. I don't know if I trust someone who a) has a name that makes it clear that the only reason they subbed the episode is because they dislike the group that has been subbing it and b) has no guarantee of quality, since their website was unhelpful at best. I don't want to find out about the great fansubbing rivalry of '04, I just want the episode. I'm not getting it because I actually trust Shinsen and Sonchou to do a decent job despite what they say, and I don't want to risk getting Fork-quality for the last episode of the fsking show. It's a bit important, y'know?

*ahem* 

That is all.

Edit: Actually, it's not. <lj-cut text=""Spoilers, just 'cause. Don't read 'em if you haven't seen the episode."">

Okay, first of all: Ed's attitude towards Mustang is perfect. Priceless, the one bit of humor in the episode. 

Archer: why the fuck can't you just crawl away and DIE? We'd all be much happier if you did.

Envy: I guess everyone had figured out that you were Hoenheim's son (or a failed attempt at ressurecting such), so that wasn't a surprise. The fact that you were also Dante's son is only a slightly bigger shock. And I will reiterate my opinion of you: BASTARD. FUCKER. I'd say motherfucker but I'm not sure even YOU deserve Dante... *shudder*

Rose: Did Dante lobotomize you? You seem to snap somewhat out of it when Ed is fricking LYING DEAD ON THE FLOOR, but I guess we can attribute your braindead-ness to shock, or somesuch...

Ed: Well, where do I start? You managed to die TWICE in ONE episode. Congratulations. The truth about alchemy must've hurt like a bitch, though. Particularly when the ZEPPELIN fell out of the SKY on you. Why did you hesitate...?

Hoenheim: I... I... I don't know what to say, here, which is amazing 'cause I managed to keep relatively cool towards Edward. But... this may seem stupid, but... HOW IN THE SEVEN HELLS do you know who Churchill is? O_o

Al: Again, THIS IS ALL ENVY'S FAULT. But you have one, very brief, line in the second to last episode - and this makes me very frightened. DON'T DIE AL...

Dante: Die. Just die.

Gluttony: I actually feel sorry for you... 

Roy: Well, that sucks don't it? Did you honestly think you had a chance against a homonculus, though? He's kicking your ass, ain't 'e?

Pride: You're kicking Roy's ass, and I have to hate you for it, but I have the sneaking suspicion that a little boy with a bag is going to be your downfall, 'cause everyone knows that MUSTANG CAN'T DIE. Or at least I'm clinging to the hope that he'll kill you. And I'm not sure why everyone's wigging out about you having a son - I instantly assumed he was adopted or something, or as the manga-readers say, he's actually your stepson.

Hawkeye: That was a trick, right? You are awesome as usual, even if you have like two lines.

Havoc: I love you. Have I mentioned this?

Armstrong/Fury/Farman/Havoc: Mustang's a Brigader General and Armstrong is a Lieutenant Colonel, aren't they? Why are you still using Colonel and Major? (not a mistranslation, I recognized the Japanese). Huh.

Everyone else: Um, please live. Unless I hate you, in which case die plzkthx. But I think I already covered all of those.

Marco/Hughes: You know, I can deal with you guys being dead. But Envy taking your shapes to taunt Edward - my murderous rage grows by the moment.

In general: I'm wishing I'd waited for 51 to watch this - but somehow I don't think it's going to get better. This way, I can get used to the agonizing sensation of waiting for SOMETHING to resolve for the gap between 51 and the movie. I just hope the last episode is an hour long. Please. I've heard encouraging news with regards to that, so please? Can you wrap it up satisfactorily in an hour? (of course, with the way things are you could wrap it up satisfactorily in ten minutes - Ed dies. Gluttony eats all, Dante gets the Philosopher's stone and goes on being a bitch, Mustang/Izumi/etc die horrible deaths, everyone I hate lives, etc, but if that is the case I will fly over to Japan and KILL YOU ALL.)

A few questions/hypothesies/random observations:

If Earth is on the other side of the gate, then what are the black thingies? 

If Al's body was taken by the black thingies, where the hell is it? 

At least it explains one problem with the FMA world being an alternate/future alternate version of earth: when you see the map it looks NOTHING like any continent on Earth. It's almost perfectly round, with one rather small bay at the top. I had a horrible though, though - UTTERLY MASSIVE ALCHEMY ARRAY. *cringe* Everything else I've guessed is wrong, tho', so I'm sure that is as well. 

If Al's body is on the other side of the gate, does that meant that it's just wandering around, braindead, in 1912 London? 

Are the black thingies dead people from earth? I can see why they want to get out, if their purpose in afterlife is to be used as energy for alchemy. When I consider that Ed has used Alchemy to dye his hair and dry his clothing, it kinda makes me cringe. 

Thank you. Oh, and once more:

OMGWTFBBQ. 

That episode DESERVES it. And a LOT of capitals.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Go me. Spoilers. I'm serious about the spoiler part."">Allrighty then. 

Is it just me, or did they DESTROY THE UNIVERSE by killing Luther? I liked the static. The static was a nice touch. But really, entire galaxies were vanishing. And the picture on the first CD is Fayt being deleted. Cool. After that was utter cheese (Maria/Fayt/Sophia: ""We do exist! Let's be existential about it for a while! Get it? 'Exist'ential? Oh, we crack ourselves up! 'Cause despite the fact that we're a whole lot of computer code, we exist, 'cause of the wonderful little thing called a happy ending pulled sideways out of the writer's ass!"" Cliff: ""Er?"" Peppita: ""I dun gettit."" Albel: ""Are they really that STUPID?"" Mirage: ""I'll sit over <i>here</i>."")

Luther could've been developed more. He was less of a character than the boss of SO2 (who I belive was ALSO named 'Lucifer' in the Japanese version), which is saying something. You don't even meet him until you fight him, and the character development consists of 'He's Blair's brother? Oh.' and 'Wow, he really <i>is</i> a loony. He wants to delete the Eternal Sphere. Wouldn't that be, like, his life's work? And that of many other people? Nutjob.'

The character selection was a little disappointing. No secret, nearly impossible to get characters? Aww. Not even any real choices. You got either Nel, Arbel, or Roger, and you don't get to choose, but you can get them back if you know what to do later? Pfft.

I don't understand the point of Roger's existence. His only plot that touched the main plot was in the middle of a sidequest with regards to an NPC that severed as nothing but a plot device to cause Fayt to angst. And he didn't even angst very well. Bad main character. What was I talking about again? Oh yeah, Roger. Why does he exist again?

I can't even remember the name of the last group of my party. Clair's father. Clair - Blair? A connection? Anything's possible. I didn't even meet/hear of him until he forced his way into my party, and I was so pissed 'cause it stopped me from being able to get Nel back. Gr.

My final party consisted of Fayt, Maria, and Arbel. I controlled Maria, 'cause otherwise she dieded a horrible little death. As it was, Fayt likes Explosion far too much for his rather meager MP to handle. And Arbel's just cool. Besides, he was the one of the three who 'rescued' me during that little debacle with the Vendeeni, so there. I used that party rather shortly after getting Arbel, although for a while I continued with Fayt, Cliff, and Nel.

Okay - I was highly upset about my ending.

Now I'm more upset about the game.

There's only ten endings. Fayt with one of the other nine characters, and Fayt alone. BULL! I got Fayt alone. Damnit, I *liked* SO2's seventy-something endings. I wanted that again. Gr.

For a game that boasted well-developed, lush worlds, there sure wasn't much of it. Elicoor had all of maybe 10 little fields between towns and dungons (Just enough to make traveling from one end to the other really time-consuming), Vanguard was a forest, a ruin, and a town, and Styx was two empty (other than incredibly powerful random fights) screens of desert. Gemity, Arkives, and Lost City barely qualify as places, at least useful ones, other than Gemity if you hate yourself enough to bet on the bunny races. And I do hate myself. So much. But they destroyed Earth - and if it wasn't utter anihillation it was close enough to make me happy. 

Oh wait. I get it. Peppita or Roger and Nel or Arbel. I guess that first one stops you from having too many short people in your party, and the latter just makes sense considering they hate each other's guts. Darn. I have to choose between Nel and Arbel? And you don't even get to choose. Pfffft.

I dunno. It was a decent game.

I actually liked the plot. Maybe I'm one of the few people who did. It was kinda cliche and made me laugh at inappropriate times, but I liked it. The universe as basically a gigantic online role-playing game, the main character an athletic computer gamer because of virtual reality. They know their audience, I'll say that much for them.

I didn't like how difficult it was to move between towns on Elicoor. I said this before but it deserves repeating.

The characters, in my opinion, didn't quite live up to those of Star Ocean 2. Oh, Fayt did a pretty decent Claude impression occasionally, Peppita and Precis meeting would be scary, but there wasn't anyone I liked as much as Ashton. I never, EVER, used Sophia, which probably made the game a lot harder. Maria was my healer, which isn't the most efficient way of using her. But it was nice that she could actually fight and had pretty good HP. As good as Arbel, anyway.

The healing that you could get inside of Sphere 211 was a bit creepy. I mean, to they have to really drive it in by <i>reprogramming</i> the characters to 'optimize' them - aka curing? O_o</lj-cut>

I have now officially wasted enough time typing this entry for FMA 48 to download. Apologies for wasting your time if you actually bothered reading all of that. I guess it can be for Jorge, so we can compare notes from the game.

I know I probably shouldn't, but I like Albel. He's an asshole, but I don't care anymore. ""It's not the great who are strong, it's the strong who are great."" I mean really. 

I get the windpipe and make it into a flute at the burned-out ruins of a workshop in the dungeon, where there's a monster walking about two inches away. I go to a town, but I can I make the flute in a fully functional and safe workshop? No. Of course not.

Note to self: Talk to every fuggin' NPC in the game. Grrr. Damn nun should've given me the hammers WITHOUT my having to ask -_-. (looking at it, that sentence looks incredibly stupid. But it pissed me off for hours.)

'nother note to self: Stop getting lost, idiot! (But it's so easy...)

Katie can't quite undertand how, when you get into a random fight, there's only one enemy visible when you bump into them - but within the random fight there's usually more than one. I found I couldn't explain it.

I have two parties, now: tried-and-true Fayt, Cliff, and Nel - and the surprisingly good Fayt, Maria, and Albel. I think I'm actually gonna stick with the latter... at least for now. 

Need more charas. When does Roger come back, or do I have to go get him...? And Pepitta? I had her for all of one battle! And Mirage - for god's sake stop finding excuses to not join my party! Of course you're probably level 50 or something... they <i>would</i> do that.</lj-cut>

"event","It has appeared now and then in fandom that Winry is unable to cook. I would like to point out that episode 45 proves this wrong. It doesn't confirm that her food is particularly good, but I'm sure it's at least edible. That part just made me like Winry even more, and I was already leaning in her favor. And let's not even talk about Schezika (or however you spell her name). I already adored her.

<lj-cut text=""Now, there are major spoilers here"">Um um um WHAT? Is Hoenheim dead now? Dante just <i>killed</i> him? Outright? Did I <i>miss</i> something? And also, then why is the baby still alive? I guess Hoenheim was the 'sacrifice' for seeing the gate, but still... 

Hoenheim, why do you have to die at such an inconvenient time, particularly now that we know you're not such a jackass after all? Al's body is just on the other side of the door you ought to know that you bastard. Tell him so that he can go get it back. Unless there's an eighth homonculus waiting in the wings who has Al's body (the much-speculated-about 'Truth' Al?), it should still be there, just waiting for someone to let it out. After all, Wrath talks about waiting (and growing) on the other side and not being let out until Ed opened the door, can't Al's body leave also? 

I'm guessing that, since anime!Wrath doesn't exist in the manga and manga!Wrath is anime!Pride, that Al's body will end up being Pride in the manga. Which is utterly crazy, but... 

I wonder if I'm the only one jumping at the thought that Al (or just his body...?) might come back as the new Greed. After all, it's been implied (or outright stated, I'm not sure) that the current sins are not the original ones, so there's room open for someone to fail at human transmutation and create a homonculus again. Lust's little flashbacks are confusing me a bit - do the homonculi have the soul of the person who was transmuted, or part of it, or what? Why would she have the memories?

Another note for a certain character who I <i>love</i> but want to smack right now: Al, you moron! Don't do that don't <i>do</i> that haven't you figured out that Tucker is utterly insane by now? Judging my the preview for episode 46, he's got a <i>tank</i> full of half-created chimera-Ninas. Now maybe it's just me, but that's insanely creepy.

I can't wait for the Ed-homonculi showdown. Isn't it <i>convenient</i>, though, that Dante just happens to send the three who he has, or can possibly get, a trump card against? He might not be able to get anything for Wrath, but still. I'm assuming she knows that he has the locket to paralyze Lust. Maybe it wouldn't occur to her that he could get something for Sloth (that was such a depressing scene), and it's likely she knows his connection with Wrath. But Gluttony and Envy - he has absolutely no clue where to get anything, since we are given zero hint as to their stories. 

I'll shut up now. But this episode brought up a million questions, and I won't even discuss Roy's rather suicidal stunt or the funny bits with Havok and the cute bits with Hawkeye. </lj-cut>

Just my blatherings, and a bit long. Ignore, please. Particularly if you haven't seen the episode yet.

"event","<lj-cut text=""The adventure begins..."">Taking a shower is a normal thing to do, so I desperately want to do so. I get home, with my roommate and her boyfriend, and desire one - but they (yes, they, it's a regular thing and I don't mind much. I do the same thing when given half a chance.) beat me to it. I don't mind, despite the fact that I've been averaging about 4 hours of sleep a night since Friday (it's now Tuesday/Wednesday), and I'm already feeling depressed over having my own boyfriend 1300 miles away for the next four months. So I wait. And wait. They ended up taking about an hour - to get out of the shower at about 12:30. I don't have to get up 'till 9, so it's okay. I start looking for my soap to take said shower, which ends up being a fifteen-minutes and ultimately fruitless search. Annoying, but my own fault ultimately. I determine to use shampoo, 'cause by now I just want to be clean. It's ungodly hot and humid here, and I had to walk around a _lot_ today. 

I go to take a shower, and the cold water won't turn on - the knob is loose. I remember this from before I left for summer break, and push the knob everywhich way to catch the trick but the damn thing has gotten worse. After ten minutes of cursing I finally ask the roommate's boyfriend to turn on the cold water, which he does. Okay. Everything is fine now, right? I step in, and begin adjusting the water - but it's way to hot. I turn the hot water down, and down, and... the water shuts off entirely. Damnit. So I attempt to turn it back on, and more cursing ensues (I think I curse when I get tired). Eventually my _roommate_ turns it on again for me and shows me the trick. Good, I got it. I take a shower, using shampoo for soap mind you, and it ends up being two minutes long 'cause I just want to _sleep_, damnit. So I step out - and now the cold water won't turn _off_, goddamn thing. I have to ask them which way to turn it since I've forgotten, and after yet more cursing and kicking of the tub it finally turns off. 

And thus ends my tale. It wouldn't've been so bad if I didn't have to ask my roommate(s) for help. That was just embarassing. I'm too easily embarassed, I think.

I am so tired. But after that mess, I was way to frustrated to sleep, so I vented to a friend over AIM. I am _so_ sorry, Joe!</lj-cut>

I am _such_ a spaz. And my apartment hates me.

In other news, I finally gave the next chapter of COHC to archmagesilvento to preread. It will probably be out relatively soon, depending on when I talk to him again. It's been written for months now... ^^;;; because of the wait, I'll let allow a spoiler: I think it will make Ranma/Ryouga fans quite happy...

"event","<lj-cut text=""FMA: Goodbyes"">It was saying goodbye that was always the hardest part. No matter how many times Edward visited, when he said goodbye it felt as if this was the last time. The last time he was going to see his brother's grey eyes smiling at him.

He'd already had that happen once, and fiercely wanted it to not happen again.

But he was needed in Central. He had become a National Alchemist for his own purposes, yes, and they had accomplished the impossible - but the series of events that they - no, that *he* had set into motion, Edward wasn't going to share the responsibility with his little brother, *ever* -  was bigger than them.

Edward hated it when someone called him small, but he felt truly microscopic when contemplating the levels upon levels of intrigue that he had unearthed. He knew that he could just leave it, and desperately wanted to simply say that it had nothing to do with him, but the harsh lesson of Lior left an ash-bitter taste in his mouth and he determined not to let that happen again. And it could, easily, despite the efforts of the newly-promoted General Mustang towards the contrary.

Even these visits, once a month like clockwork, threatened. Change could come so quickly...

So Edward gritted his teeth and smiled a pale shadow of a grin as he hugged his brother and left the Rockbell house, not once looking back. 

After all, if he had looked back they would've seen the tears on his cheeks. 

***

Alphonse waved despite knowing that his brother wouldn't look back. He never did - Edward always looked forward. But even before Edward had even reached the end of the walkway leading to the main path Al was forced to stop, bringing his arm down and holding it gingerly in his lap and trying not to wince in pain. 

He would never curse the body that their hard work and sacrifice had allowed him to regain, but sometimes he hated it. It was weak, so weak, and despite having almost half a year to get used to it there was something in his brain that wouldn't allow him full use of his body. Winry likened it to people who acquired automail for the first time - it often took years to be able to move the limbs properly, because no matter how advanced the technology got it wasn't natural and could never be. 

And Al hadn't said anything, but Winry had been quick to explain how Edward was the exception to the rule. Undoubtedly his youth at the time, she said - at eleven his brain had been capable of growing, of changing the instinct to work with new things. Like children picking up languages better than adults, she said.

He never asked how not having a physical brain for four years could affect things. It would only cause her more grief.

As it was, he was perfectly capable of performing most everyday tasks. He helped Winry with her work and earned the half-joking title of 'nurse', but he couldn't perform the fine tasks necessary to actually assemble and install automail. Hard work had stilled the shaking in his hands to allow him to draw perfect circles for arrays again, and he had started to accept the occasional odd job from the village.

The work had to come to him, though. He couldn't make the long walk without being carried most of the way or stopping so often that it took far too long to be practical. 

He spent a lot of time looking out the window, taking in the oddly juxtaposed smells of the outdoors and indoors - grass and flowers and the occasional whiff of freshly growing fruit mixed with oil and dust and blood, when they had a customer. But the sight of the hills made him want to run over them again like he could so vividly remember. Run down to the river and throw rocks in it again. He'd tried so many times but couldn't, not without gasping for breath after mere minutes or having his legs simply give out underneath him. 

He couldn't even wave goodbye to his brother properly. Much less keep up with his busy life in Central - not that his brother wanted him to be involved, anyway.

Goodbyes were always the worst part. He trusted his brother not to get killed but the worry lingered. Al had always been able to protect Ed before but not anymore. As a suit of armor he had been able to protect his brother, at least. And if he lost his brother, there would be no point.

No point at all.

""Damnit.""

Winry glanced at him, surprised. Alphonse Elric was not one to curse lightly or, indeed, at all. But there was understanding, too. If anyone knew it was Winry, because Edward couldn't.

""Al...?""

""I'm fine.""

""Alright."" She never questioned him. Sometimes Al wondered if he deserved that.

***

Edward chuckled, and turned the page. He'd trained himself out of motion sickness induced by reading, and pictures weren't a problem at all.

In a mere year of having Alphonse's body back, he had acquired a trove of photographs that Hughes would have approved of. The binder currently sitting in his lap was a mere sample.

The current picture that had his attention was a new one. Alphonse, hand thrust close to the camera with two fingers held up in a vee, with a grin that seemed to take up the entire  lower half of his face. The reason for his glee stood more calmly next to him, but Winry was clearly just as happy, just slightly more dazed. Her right hand gripped Al's and there was a nearly hidden but still visible glitter on her left.

Edward grinned at the picture, and said, ""You don't have to gloat,"" without a trace of actual jealousy. 

""Who's gloating?""

Edward looked up, startled, smiled, and pointed at the picture. ""V for victory? Don't you think that's a bit much?""

Al settled in the seat opposite his brother and blew quickly on the hot coffee he held to cool it. He didn't respond until he had taken a sip. ""Sorry, brother,"" he said without the slightest bit of apology in his voice. ""But I always win.""

Edward growled and chucked the album at him. Al meeped and dodged quickly, letting it bounce off of the seat next to him and thump to the floor. Al reached down to pick it up and froze, staring at the page that it had fallen open to and not moving until his fingers began to scald. 

Ed looked at his brother smugly. ""Who said that I was in the race?""

Al picked up the album. ""Bro-ther!"" he protested. ""When were you going to tell me?!""

Edward chuckled evilly, but didn't dodge fast enough to avoid an album to his face.

***

Half an hour later the two brothers and the younger's fiancee stepped off the train unto a busy platform. Ed, guided by habit, started off at his usual quick pace.

""Wait up!"" 

Ed stopped and turned, slightly annoyed at the holdup. He wanted to get home - well, to the hotel that would serve as home until they found a more permanent place to live - and he knew they did too, so what could possibly be the matter?

He slammed down on the mental complaints before they had a chance to become verbal. Al was opening his suitcase and pulling out a large swath of cloth. For a moment Ed's mind went blank as he watched his brother slide into a green cloak that was clearly designed to imitate the red one that Edward had almost forgotten about. 

Al grinned and turned around, showing off the symbol on the back.

""I thought we should match... but I like green better. Hope you don't mind."" Al looked suddenly worried, as if he thought that the color was somehow offensive to his brother.

Ed found his voice. ""No, it's fine.""

Al looked legitimately relived, which made Winry chuckle and reach up to ruffle his hair. ""I told you so. Now let's go.""

""Yeah."" Al grinned, suddenly, not the least bit self-consious, and looked up, first at the sky before his eyes settled on the skyline. He offered the city a brief wave before Ed's shout snapped him out of it, and he ran to catch up. 

Goodbyes were hard. But they didn't mean anything without a hello.

***

Slightly edited now. I hope it meshes a bit more now - giving more of a time gap between the halves helps, I think. But it's still quite a mood change...

I wanted to bring it full circle - goodbye to hello, and I liked the various small ideas that I put in those scenes, like the photographs and the coat. Oh well. I also started it sorta depressed but cheered up during the course of writing. I'm weird...

I'll leave it up to your imagination as to who Ed is with. Maybe I'll flesh this out a bit more later. </lj-cut>

I wrote this on a whim. Edited as of Sunday, August 22nd.

"event","Tampa was due for it, I suppose. I always knew it - look at a chart of recent hurricanes to hit Florida and you'll note a distinct lack of such in the region of Tampa Bay. Always considered myself lucky, but if there's one thing I believe in it's the law of averages...

<lj-cut text=""Hurricane Charley"">My parents live in Port Richey, which is about an hour north of Tampa, Florida. Hurricane Charley, which is currently category 2 (I think, the website is hard to navigate), is due to land very close by there - quite possibly within ten miles of where my parents and several of my best friends live. They're all making evacuation plans - Cocoa Beach and a friend's house in Hernando, but... gah. I'm impossibly worried. Gainesville, which is where I currently am, is going to get hit but since we're well inland it shouldn't be too bad - just a really really bad storm. Shouldn't be too bad, but Charley has the potential to be a category 4 hurricane when it hits land - to give you an idea, Hurricane Andrew was category 4... you remember, the one that destroyed large swathes of Miami in the early nineties? Either '94 or '96. But I'm going on a tangent, here. 

All I can do, right now, is sit tight up here in Gainesville and feel horribly guilty for not being there. Of course, if I was there I'd be going bonkers and probably not much help, but at least I would know more of what was going on, rather than just sitting up here worrying... argh. </lj-cut>

Ouch. Ouch ouch ouch. The plot twist at the end wasn't all that astonishing - I'd been suspicious of Dante/Lyla since the episode when Greed died, who wasn't - but still. Hoenheim is being even more confusing now. So Dante/Lyla is 'that person' (I guess... doesn't make perfect sense, but seems to be what they're trying to imply), but who's 'Hoenheim of Light'? And - they can't make a body for Al with the Philosopher's Stone? Well, that just makes me cry. Take over another body? Al wouldn't do that. However - that scene, um a couple episodes ago - when Ed touched Al and reacted so strangely - the vision went past the door, and there was some sort of figure there... maybe I'm being too optimistic and deluding myself into thinking that it looked an awful lot like Al. 

Apparently there's gonna be a movie. The website contains nothing but a picture of older!Ed (two years older... so eighteen), carefully dressed so as not to reveal if he's restored or not (and to reveal that the boy has no fasion sense when he gets older), and the 'trailer' is clips from the third opening and the show with Roy's seiyuu giving the 'touka koukan' speech from the first 40 episodes. Grr. Guess they can't reveal anything tho'... but I guess it disproves some of the pessimistic speculation that Ed is going to die at the end of the series.

Half the time I'm convinced that it's being serious then it pulls some complete bullshit like the stamp from the aquarium being some sort of identifying mark or the gem being stolen by the crazy lady, whatshername.

And it takes all the fun out of being a slasher. I mean really, it's just TOO easy. I mean Yuuri/Wolfram is just silly, and then there's Gunter/Yuuri and Konrad/Yuuri and Gwendal/Yuuri and Gwendal/Gunter and those are just the ones that are BLATANT. Poor Yuuri. And built-in fangirls who argue over the pairings. Whoever wrote this KNEW... 

Oh hell, I'll just go with a Konrad/Yuuri/Wolfram OT3 and get it OVER with. I can live with the fact that Konrad and Wolfram are brothers (well, half). Poor Gwendal will just have to deal with Gunter. Or is it Gunter having to deal with Gwenal...? Heh, I dunno.</lj-cut>

"event","Working at a library, interestingly enough, is actually getting me reading. Go figure. I've already read most of the Sandman series (by Neil Gaiman), and desperately await the rest of it to be returned; I've also read the first book of Arabian Nights (up till something like the 150th night, and then the first volume was over, and it wasn't really *that* great. The stories got repetitive.). Now I'm working on Romance of the Three Kingdoms. A good book, even if it's hard keeping all the names straight and they're spelled differently in this version (which was published in 1945). 

Yes, I'm reading it partially because of games, but the book is legitimately interesting. The plot is often hard to follow, and don't get me started on the names; remembering that Liu Pei (or Liu Bei in newer translations) is also called Yuan-te sometimes but has absolutely no relation to Yuan Shao is something I strugged with for a few pages. The copy that I downloaded on my old computer had the more familiar names only - but that version is gone now, *sniff*. 

Summer's almost over. I'm sort of looking forward to my senior year but dreading it too. Leaving Florida is always difficult, and this year isn't going to be any better. I'm also nervous about my ability to make it through the last stretch; I feel like I slipped by the past three years without really earning it. I mean, I worked my ass off but I'm not really sure I *did* anything. 

This is the first summer that I've spent somewhere other than home. The depressing part is that I miss my cats more than anything else, really. Home is just... not pleasant. My parents barely tolerate Dennis despite the fact that we're engaged (I honestly think that's the only reason they put up with him at all), and the dogs just make it positively unpleasant to be anywhere but in my room. I'm worried about not being with my cats, too... poor Scamper is *old*. I mean, seriously aged. I got her when I was in first grade... so she's about fifteen. Part Maine Coon, which is a long-lived breed, but still. Pixel died a while ago, so I know she's been lonely. And Katt, Dennis' cat (he's so original with names, I know, but technically it's after a video game character) must be bored out of her mind. She was an indoor-outdoor cat for years, and now she lives in a room, and with an old cat she doesn't get along with much. I wish I could take her to Oklahoma, but I doubt she would get along with Philbert or Moe (my roommate's cats), and I can't risk her getting outside there. I'd never find her again. 

Downloading Kyou Kara Maou, on the enthusiastic recommedation of several people. It's going slowly but hopefully it will speed up soon.

Well, I believe that it is bedtime. This 'getting up early' business doesn't suit me. I never get to talk to Joe anymore. Another thing to miss from previous summers. But maybe it's doing him some good, since he's got a girlfriend now.

One more year in Oklahoma, then I don't have to do this bullshit called 'long distance' anymore. Here's hoping for my sanity during that year...

Just gotta give it a final grammar check and send it to Joe, then it will be posted. That might take a while, but it's written, anyway. 

I also have a new installment of my arc written. I'm thinking of 'Multiplex' for the title of the arc - not sure tho'. Just trying to come up with something to call it by, rather than just 'the arc'. Unfortunately I think more people will associate the word 'multiplex' with a building than anything else...

Episode 40 of FMA was utterly amazing. <lj-cut text=""Spoilers here..."">

You know, I knew that the Fuhrer was a homonculus - or at least strongly suspected, since I'd gotten spoilers from people who'd read the manga. I hated the spoilers, but they said he was Wrath... a difference between the anime and manga, I wonder, or just faulty information? Ah well. 

Poor Martel. *sniff* But now Al knows... I think... and damn, there was just something about seeing that blood pour out of Al's armor like that. This show boggles me, sometimes.

And how many people thought that a LOT of the characters who are turning out to be important were never going to reappear again? I mean... Yoki (tho' he's dead), Lyla, Rose, Schezika (or however you spell her name)... who expected them to be so important? I was thinking that FMA had fewer important characters than a lot of animes of its length... but nope! Of course not. I love it. Now I'm just waiting for Russel and Fletcher to appear again. At least Majihal is dead.

Elysia-chan doodling on the sidewalk. Cuteness overload. I spotted an alien, godzilla, and an attempt at a transmutation array. Maybe the people who speculate that she'll become an alchemist later on are right...?

One more thing. No, really, just one. BOY can Al draw an array fast. He must've made the big one he used when fighting Kimbly through alchemy, 'cause he certainly didn't draw it during the fight. That, and watching him and Ed duke it out like that was highly amusing. 

Okay, okay, I'm done, really!

Of course, I'd rather have the episodes when it came out, but I *just* heard about Spoon fansubs, the group that is doing it this month.

I want to go to sleep and not wake up until 7am on Saturday, whereupon I will go to the airport, fly home, sleep until Monday, and be happyhappyhappy... aaaa I just want to get to Gainesville. That's all I ask... is it too much? 

I also want to write. Trying to come up with an FMA idea that doesn't suck too bad. Think I've got one, although the beginning is bleh. BLEH.

In other news... my life just got a whole lot more relaxed. I'm legitimately bored, now.

Playing D&D over the summer. And entirely unintenionally, I think my character is shaping into a female Roy Mustang. I am the saddest person alive.

<lj-cut text=""Ficcage news for the bored""> 
So, over the course of the next couple of weeks, those of you who are following my fics can look forward to: 

COHC 3.06! It's been mostly written for months. The hardest part is pulling it to a decent length and a decent ending and cleaning it up.

""Upon My Waking"" - final version. I think it's a LOT better now.

Maybe a couple more FMA fics. I might put them on my website. Garg. Right now I've got two things in the works and while the one is probably not gonna end up going anywhere, the second doesn't have such pretensions and is pure fluffy happy goodness. We need more of that, I think.
</lj-cut>

Well, I've got a review at 9pm for my final at 8am. Isn't that just WONDERFUL?

Taken from <lj user=""scimitarsmile"">

1. Shampoo:
It's green...

2. Bags:
Luggage? A tiny black one with wheels for short vacations, and an old blue and brown one for longer vacations, plus my laptop case/backpack for both...

3. T-shirts:
The same ones I've always had. They tend to be blue or grey, and several have dragons. Oh, a few ASK shirts, too, and that horribly old thing from New Orleans that I should get rid of but it's comfortable.

4. Pants:
Jeans. Typically whatever was on sale and fit me.

5. Sweaters/Jacket:
Red hoodie. 

6. Shoes:
when required: My boots. Otherwise: sandals.

7. Socks:
With my boots.

8. Toothpaste:
currently? Aquafresh.

9. Face cleanser:
um... soap?

10. Computer:
IBM Think Pad A22m... so old...

11. Wallet:
Mickey Mouse *shame* but it's a good wallet. My other ones fell apart when I was a freshman, this one is as good as new.

12. School Bags:
Black and blue Targis laptop case/backpack. It's nifty, even if half of the buckles are broken.

13. Pens:
Don't use pens much, but when I do it's usually the cheapo Bics, 'cause I lose them so easily.

14. Cellphone:
Don't have one...

15. Pizza:
Spinach Alfredo! mmmm.

16. Clock:
My tiny 5 dollar alarm clock and my computer.

17. Pillow Case/Bed sheet:
Dark blue?

18. Furnitures in your room:
Here? cheap desk/shelves from walmart and a nice dresser that I think was my roommate's grandmother's. At home in FL: an antique dresser (really really nice, big mirror and everything), a set of shelves my grandfather built for me when I was a baby, a somewhat crappy bed, an old and cheap desk, and an electric keyboard...

19. Cups/mugs:
A few plastic ones. Otherwise, I use my roommate's.

20. Sanrio characters:
No clue what this one means. Hello Kitty? I don't know.

21. Magazines:
Um... various technical magazines occasionally, I guess. I currently own a copy of some sailing magazine, but that's got a story behind it...

22. Car:
My feet.

23. Chocolate:
Mint. 

24. Candy:
York Peppermint Patties. mmmmm

25. Medicine:
None on a regular basis, just a multivitamin when I feel like it, Ibuprofen when I get a headache, and sudaphed during certain times of the year...

26. Chips:
Sour cream and onion.

27. Popcorn:
Kettle corn.

28. Motorcycle:
hehehehe. Me on a motorcyle? Yeah right.

29. Camera:
um.. whatever it is, it's in florida right now...

30. Underwear:
? um.. comfortable?

31. Cologne/Perfume:
I dunno the brand. I think it was a gift.

32. Lotion:
it smells like lavender...

33. Cigarette:
Nope.

34. Accessories:
Everpresent hair clips, and occasionally my cat-sun-moon necklace and earrings, occasionally my silver lavalier...

35. If you are a brand:
Huh?

The emotion icon was picked 'cause it seemed funny.

In other news, I have this strange urge to write FMA fanfic while listening to ""Ready Steady Go"" on repeat. What the hell? You know, for a song that I didn't like much at first, I sure am falling in love with it now. Wish I knew why.

<lj-cut text=""Ranma 1/2: Motivate Me"">
<b><i>Motivate Me</b></i>

The bed was warm, inviting, and no alarm clock in the world could possibly convince its occupant to move. What was the point anymore?

It was all useless fighting, came the grouchy thought as a hand reached out, snakelike, to grab a sheet and pull it over thin shoulders. And fighting over what? That thought made the overall mood of the moment positively rancorous.  

Fight over <i>her</i>, that was all. And not even her as a person. Just as <i>her</i>, the indefinable female, the ideal, the body, the idol. And what was it, really? Not even what they thought it was. No one knew what it was, and <i>that</i> particular thought, with the tone that combined the ethereal feminine mystery with typical grouchy teenage angst, made a chuckle bubble up, almost unwillingly, to escape the covers and hover near the ceiling uncertainly.

Awake now and not pleased over this fact, the occupant of the bed twisted, wrapping covers round and round again as if to provide an extra layer of protection. 

It was all so stupid, so juvenile. School was supposed to be a place for growth, for learning, but instead it seemed to stifle, to turn every person inside into a quivering mass of nerves and gray jelly that pretended to think.

Except that one person. The person who looked at it and took the abuse resignedly even as half the eyes there contained desire with various levels of concealment. Some were blatant, and those were regular annoyances whom everyone wished would simply go away, most of the time.

But of course, the outside world was not content to let anyone sleep, particularly not this person who had such a role to play. 

And besides, there was motivation. Of a sort.

... I still think it was sheer luck. Other results include Master, Student, Average, and Bastardization. I think 'student' is higher than 'average', which is kinda sad, really...

In other news, I still need to do my lab report and I'm editing ""Upon My Waking"" so that it's a little less painful to read. Whee! I'm also writing 'Wave', which may or may not suck. It might also be a continuing story, unlike ""Waking"", which looks like it could be continued but won't be. Hm.

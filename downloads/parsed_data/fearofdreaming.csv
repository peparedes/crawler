"event","Well this makes day 2 of my alone time away from Kent and I'm going nuts without someone here to keep me company. I hate being here at night alone it's so creepy. I've been talking to Jeff a lot he's good company but it's not as good as person to person. I'll be glad when Kent and Lydia finally come home. I go nuts and want alone time when they are here but I only like it for a little while. I would go crazy if I ever lived by myself I think. I talked to mom and dad today. Mom was a bitch as usual and dad sounded really sad. I'm guessing it's b/c tomorrow will be Erik's death day. I can't believe it's been 5 years already. There is nothing I would like more than to hug up to him and let him tell me everything is going to be okay. When everyone else made me feel like shit he was always there for me. It figures the one person in my life I could always count on had to die. Sometimes I wish I would have been there to do it with him. Him and I had talked before about killing ourselves together. At least he had Robert to go with him only Robert went a few hours ahead of him. I have so many nightmares thinking about that day. I have never walked up on a dead body before. I wonder if Erik and Robert meant to both die that night or it was an accident. It sure is odd that they both died the same night. I still wonder if I could have done more for him. Instead of running over there as soon as I heard something might be wrong I waited for a fucking cake to get done. That amount of time could have saved him. I wonder if I could have woke him up I didn't even try I just put a cold rag on his face. 

  I can still hear his heavy breathing. I can still see the blood puddling up in his mouth. I still see his body lifting off the bed each time they shocked him. I remember holding his cold hand as I waited for his end. I still see the pool of blood dried on robert's mouth, arm and floor. The awful dry heat burning our bodies. I wish I believed in an after life so I could think that I would see him again. But at least he's not having to live day by day wondering where his next meal or joint is going to come from. God I want him to hug me and kiss me on the forehead like he use to. Fuck I miss you Erik. So I feel like shit now. I'm going to stop trying to think about this. It's not good to be alone and think about death."

"event","Well Kent and I had our usual never ending arguement about affection. I just flat out told him that sometimes I don't feel like kissing him or being affectionate with him. I told him I didn't know why b/c I don't really. I still love him and I'm still attracted to him so I don't know what the deal is really. I decided I needed some time away from him to sort my mind out. Well our first day of apartness he came over to get some stuff and we talked a while. He let me know that he really did want to fix things and he told me he couldn't live without me. That surprised me b/c I thought he didn't want to be with me anymore. I thought it over and we talked some more on messenger and we decided to try and work at it some more. We both seem to want this to happen so maybe it will work. I just hope it doesn't get fucked up again. I can't handle this emotional rollercoaster crap. This kills me so much to not know what's going on. But maybe it will stick this time. I have the house to myself until Sat. so that's kind of crazy. I have never had this much alone time. I think it will do us some good though. I think friday night me kent and josh are going to hang out and do something. I know I'm not going to get drunk. I'm tired of doing that every weekend. It turns out Jeff isn't going to go see Rasputina with us. That's crappy I was looking forward to experiencing that with him. But all kinds of craziness is going on so I don't want to cause problems with anyone. Jeff came over Sunday and I had a great time hanging out with him. There's no telling when we'll get to do that again or if we ever will be able to. Kent doesn't trust him so who knows. Well I'm going to head off to bed and enjoy my lonely night of uninterrupted sleep. Maybe I'll remember to start writing in this more often."

"event","My oh my, what all has happened since I last submitted an entry? Well I have a 5 week old daughter named Lydia Abigail. Kent and I are still together but I almost left a few days ago b/c he informed me he slept with this slut right before we got married. She use to come over to hang out with him and Josh supposedly, and when they went to sleep she would crawl into his bed and try seducing him night after night and Kent allowed this. He claims they only screwed once and then he didn't let her stay over any more afterwards but how do I know? I mean he's waited until we've been married for 2 years and have a child to tell me this shit. More than likely I would have left if I had a car, money, and a place to go, at least for a little while. I'd still like to go somewhere for a short time to clear my mind of this Kent situation, my family problems, and being stressed with no sleep from Lydia. It's all crashing down really hard. Why oh why couldn't there be more lesbian/bi girls where I live so that maybe I could stop getting shit on by walking hard ons. I'm trying to just let all of this go but I feel like I shouldn't. I feel like I'm giving women a horrible image by putting up with bullshit like this. I feel so trapped, but I do love him. I wish I at least had a chick friend to talk to on the phone, or hang out with b/c all I have is Kent, a screaming baby, my 2 cats, and writing. Well Kent is at my parents house with Lydia trying to fix Felicia's computer I hope him and my mom aren't going at it. I don't think I'll ever go over there again, as long as mom is alive anyway. I guess that's that for now. Maybe I'll start writing more often."

It's just a matter of one of us making the first move to end it. But I have no where to go, and I would have to give him the baby b/c I will probably be living on the streets by the time it's born. He told me he would give me some money to help me out but I refuse to take it. He doesn't owe me anything and I dont' want to owe him anything. I want to die so badly right now. I don't even have one fucking friend I can talk to about any of this b/c I have none. That's why I'm having to type on this. Crying makes me very sleepy. I wish I wasn't so afraid of the pain of dying so I could just do it. But I'm a wuss. Well that's all that's going on basicly so I'll end here."

"event","Yesterday was mine and Kent's 2 year anniversary and all we did was fight. I cried the entire night. We have nothing in common anymore. We can't carry on a conversation about anything without disagreeing or fighting about it. It's like we don't even have anything to say to each other unless we're fighting. He has a completely different vision of our future than I do. He wants to live in a cabin in the woods for the rest of our lives. He doesn't want to work, he wants to just play guitar all day out in the woods. He wants us to have a very simple life with no bills, which means no power, cable, phone, internet, etc. But I'm not wasting my time in college for 4 years to not have anything to show for it. If I have a job I'm going to have power and other things. We've talked since we've been together about finding or building our own house and what all we were going to have done to it. Then out of no where he says we're not going to do that, we're going to live in a rotting, smelly cabin in the woods just b/c we won't have house payments. 

   Plus he doesn't want to finish college and wants to stay in haleyville and work at service zone right now, which means I wouldn't be able to finish school. We just want too many different things. If I wasn't pregnant I would pack a bag and take some money and get on a bus and just go somewhere. But now I have a child to think about so I'm screwed. I hate that it's having to be brought into this mess and this awful world. Desiree called me today and told me that her and I can get an apartment together if it doesn't work out with Kent. I don't think we could get along well enough for that. I need to just be alone somewhere. But I have no money or no car, so I'm just stuck here. If it doesn't work out with Kent I guess he'll have to keep the kid while I go live on the streets or kill myself. Those are looking to be my only options. Fuck I hate life. I wish I had the guts to just kill myself. Maybe I'll die during giving birth. Right now Kent's gone to Josh's house to smoke up and have Josh tell him how awful I am and how he doesn't need me, etc. I hate Josh. I hate everyone including myself most of all. Oh and another thing, my parents are about to lose their house if they don't come up with 1,400.00 by the 30th of this month. So mom has been calling me harrassing me about letting them borrow money from Kent. We let my dad borrow 500.00 last christmas and he still owes about 200.00. He's always going to be in debt. If he can't pay that he can't pay us. My mom hates my guts and just pisses me off except when she wants to use us then she's all lovey. It's not our problem, we didn't tell them to go use up about 5 credit cards and go into debt. God I want to die."

"event","My life is falling apart. I'm 3 months pregnant, my husband and I can't stand each other. My family is driving me insane and seem to hate me right now. I'm doing awful in school this semester. I've only been going for a month and I've already almost missed all of my sick days. I just hate going anymore. Which is weird b/c I thought for sure after I figured out my major I would have ambition to go and do well. Last night my mom called and had to make fun of the name I have picked out for my child some more. Then she tried telling me I don't care about my brother b/c I don't visit his grave on a regular basis. I cared and still care more about Erik than she could ever think of doing. She is the reason he is dead in my opinion. One of these days I'm going to get up the nerve to tell her that. I cried for a long time after she hung up. I was already depressed b/c of me and Kent being so distant and she just made me explode. I just wish everyone would leave me alone. People don't care about me, they just want to tell me what I'm doing wrong with my life. I really wish I wasn't pregnant right now. It couldn't be a worse time. I think I would try to run far away if I wasn't pregnant, where no one knows me and I can be left alone. Maybe my child will love me and care about me, at least while it's small. I'm going to try my damnest to be a great mother, and do everything my unworthy to call a mother didn't do for me. I would let her have my every last opinion and never speak to her again if it wasn't for me wanting to see Felicia and Dad. It still may happen though if she keeps it up. 

  On a different note, Kent and I went to the state fair this evening b/c I wanted some good fair food, and I didn't even get any b/c it cost so freaking much. A fucking funnel cake was $4.00 and a caramel apple was $3.00. At least I did get a sno cone. I got to pet the livestock in the petting zoo. That was the only thing I could do really. I'm usually riding every single ride there but now that I'm pregnant I don't get to have any fun. Oh and Kent and I were walking about and BAM out of no where there was my dad and Felicia. They told me they were going tomorrow and they were going to stop by and pick us up. Well they didn't even bother to come by and see us, and they weren't going to either. And my dad of all people I wouldn't have expected that from. He at least acts like he enjoys my company. I don't know what is I do to everyone that makes them hate my presence so much. Fuck them all, I've been alone my entire life and I always will be. I can only count on myself for anything. Friends and family only use and abuse you. I don't know how much longer me and Kent are going to last with us fighting every day and never touching each other. I wish I had the guts to just kill myself and end countless days of misery headed my way. Why does anyone want to live to work every day of their life away just to retire, get sick and die? We're just ants in a colony. :-("

I plan to go blow it at hot topic and thrift stores. Kent was all pissed off b/c he had to work the day he was hired but at least he's working. Josh wanted him to take him to Haleyville tonight and he was bummed about that. Josh thinks he's his fucking taxi ride. So now I'll have a lot of free time to myself since he'll be gone, so that kicks ass. I mean I love Kent and like being with him but I like alone time as well. OH yeah and Kent has decided that he doesn't mind if I get a girlfriend since I've been really interested in them lately. For some reason girls don't bother him, he doesn't consider that cheating. That's cool with me, only there isn't a big lesbian scene where I live so it will be sort of hard to find one. Oh and I went to the dr. today and I have a nice bladder infection. So I got me some fucking 50.00 antibiotics. Well I think I'll take a nap now."

Well I just look at it today and he obviously found it and smoked it all. The deal was he only smokes it when he needs it. He's never going to stop lying to me I might as well get that through my head. Last friday he left to get Josh and came back 5 hours later and didn't think I would mind b/c I don't like Josh. I said, ""Oh so you didn't think it would bother me that I didn't know where you were all day?"" And he came home stoned to add to it after he promised me he would quit doing it with him. I don't have a problem with pot unless you do it for the hell of it all of the time. He's gone with Josh right now getting stoned and when he gets home we're going to have to fight all over again. If I had a car I think I would have already left him. This is never going to stop I might as well realize that."

So he finally took all he could and let her have it right back which made her jaw fly open in shock. But it all ended after a few hours and everyone was hunky dory again. We went to the estuarium which was the only nice thing there. I loved the sea animals. I watched a giant green eel forever. Kent stole a Liter bottle of Wild Turkey from my cousin's place that we stayed at, while my dad stole a liter of Crown Royal. And we filled a 20 oz. bottle full of Absolut Vodka. He's obviously a rich man. 

  I started a diet yesterday. My goal is to lose 10-15 pounds. I'm working out and eating low fat foods. My meals are cereal, soup, and fruit mainly. I had to buy some animal crackers today though b/c I was craving some sweets. Well i guess that's it for now."

The giant cowboy belt buckle sort of scares me though along with the steel toe snake boots. It won't last long though b/c as soon as he sneezes the wrong way she'll dump him.

I know Keith gave it to that bitch April b/c she probably wanted her. I cried and cried. I loved that kitten so much. God I miss her. I want to fucking kill him sometimes. If I knew I could get away with it I would. Then again that would make kent hate me. But whatever I can't even kill an animal.

I get so tired of the arguing and me crying myself to sleep. If I had a car I would probably leave right now so we would both be happy. I mean I love him but I think he would rather be spending his college years with his friends getting stoned and drunk than have a wife right now. I understand that completely but he should have decided that before he married me. My problem is I can't leave though, I have no where to go, no money, no car. Maybe I should just kill myself and not have to worry about anything anymore. It never fails every time I let someone in my heart they just hurt me. And I can't seem to stop myself from attaching to them. Stupid emotions, why do we have them? At least he'll be gone most of the evening/night so I can chill out by myself. I wish there were people on my msn messenger list that actually talk to me b/c I could really use a friend right now. Well at least I don't have any friends to break my heart.

"event","Well I started my first day at Hardee's today. This is also my first job so of course I didn't know what to expect. I had the worst migraine ever when I got out of that place. Why did they have to put me on the fucking cash register the first day? I only screwed up 2 orders today. Kathy (satan) bitched me out b/c I was suppose to cook my own fries when the pan was empty. Like I know to do that on my first day. I mean shit I don't know anything unless they tell me. I don't want to go back already tomorrow. Its hell. My 3 hours I put in was not worth $15.75. God I've got to find another job. Mitch came in there b/c his sister was filling out an application. He cut his hair and he was dressed up and he looked very nice. He's always giving me this loving look. If he weren't such a dope head I would like him a lot more. Kent went to see ""The Animal"" tonight with Josh and his mom. I was hoping to have him caress me and make me feel better after working my ass off. Oh well, I'm not going to keep him from doing something if I'm not even going to be with him. Well I suppose that's it for now. Jesus I hope tomorrow goes better than today. But I know it won't. - NOt so Peaceful"

"event","When I wake up early in the morning, lift my head, I'm still yawning. When I'm in the middle of a dream stay in bed, float up stream. Everybody seems to think I'm lazy. I don't mind, I think they're crazy. Running everywhere at such a speed till they find there's no need. Please don't spoil my day I'm miles away. Keeping an eye on the world going by my window. Lying there for a sleepy feeling. -John Lennon

 Okay that's just how I feel today. I can't seem to get this sleepy feeling out of me. I got to see Green Day's new ""Waiting"" video last night. I always melt when I see Billie Joe. He will always be the love of my life I do believe. I would ravage him if I got to meet him. That is if his wife would leave long enough. *giggle* I also got to see Tool's ""Schism"" video. It was pretty crazy. I think the ""Sober"" video is still my favorite. I'm waiting on Kent to get off of work so I can go and do nothing at his house like always. I think I would rather be bored at my house instead of his b/c when I go somewhere else I expect to have something to do, therefore it disappoints me more. I finally got to talk to Pan today. I didn't think I was ever going to hear from him again. He tried talking me into taking a road trip with him but I don't think I like him enough to be stuck with him for a long period of time. Besides I don't want to visit the crappy united states. I want to go to Europe. I want to live in Italy. It would be so great if I could get a job that would let me travel so I didn't have to pay for it. I will end up with a shitty paying job for the rest of my life and I'll never be able to afford anything. Well anywho... I'm going to go back to sleep now while I'm waiting on Kent.-Peace.<img src=""johnbook.jpg"" width=200 height=200 alt="""">"

"event","I have had a pretty good summer so far. I've got to stay at Kent's a good deal. My mom has been really leniant with that for some reason. I'm a senior now. That's been on my mind a lot lately. I mean I know big whoop its just another year of school and then I'll be going to another school (college) so who cares. I care about the fact that it scares me that I'm having to grow up. I use to pray for this day to come. Anyway.. enough on that. I rented Gladiator finally this weekend. I love it so much. I have to buy it. Maximus is so great. 

  I'm thinking about naming my kid that. Its a bold, strong name. I think I'll name my daughter Ophelia. Then again would that be sentencing her to depression and death before she has a chance? I can't wait til I retire and move to Italy. Life will be great then. I have to suffer until then. I have finally decided that I'm going to get the faerie from the Jethro Tull ""Broadsword and the beast"" album cover tattooed on me. I want a cool feminine faerie too but I can't find one I like. They are all too cartoon looking. I'd like something sort of like a Brian Froud drawing. I don't know. Its sad that my life is so shitty I have to sit around and look for pictures to scar my body with. I feel really scared and sad right now. I think I will go cry. -not so peaceful"

"event","Oh god what a week. Suddenly my life seems to be sent to the hounds with their stomachs trembling with hunger. What am I going to do? I don't know if I can handle moving to a new school for my senior year of high school. I mean I don't really have any friends here to stay for but at least I am use to everything here. Plus I'm almost positive the school there is on the block system so I would be half credits behind in everything. Oh shit what am I going to do. If I stay here that will be one year longer that I have to stay away from Kent. I don't know if I can do that. I need him. There is just going to be so much stress doing all of this shit. I mean Kent is going to have to take me to school in the morning and go to college and then pick me up from school and we both go to work. That is just too much stress all at once for me. I'm going to have a breakdown. Plus I know Kent's mom is going to be on our asses for getting married anyway. She's already on our asses. I can't take much more of her shit as it is.

  Scott S. called me today. I haven't talked to him in like a year. I wasn't very talkative  b/c I didn't really know what to say to him. He's down for a month and then he's joining the marines. He got a $30,000 scholarship. That's good for him. Maybe he won't be such an ass afterwards. He was telling me that he doesn't believe in god and he's a witch and such. I just rolled my eyes and went along with it. First of all if he knew anything about it he would call himself a warlock instead of a witch. Plus he was saying he was going to hell and he didn't care. Well that religion doesn't really believe in heaven or hell. Anyway...I'm not in that world anymore. Although I'm reminded of it everyday b/c of my lovely karma that pays me a visit on a daily basis. I dug out my old Eve 6 tape. I haven't heard this in like 2 years. I like their new song, something about ""Here's to the night's we felt alive"" blah blah. God I'm dreading getting my senior portraits made. I hate all of this senior shit. I'm not ready to graduate and have more stress come into my life. I hope Kent doesn't turn out to be an ass in the long run and I'm going through all of this for nothing. But I know he's not or I wouldn't be going this far with it. Well I'm going to go to bed now I think. If I can stop thinking about my future long enough. -Peace"

"event","I can't believe I haven't posted since Sunday night. In a hunch I'll try to get out all of my crappy feelings of the week. Well Monday night Kent and his mom had to freak the hell out over me. That *$@#&  flat out told Kent that she hated me guts b/c I try to take him away from her or some shit. I think Kent is old enough to decide for himself what or who he wants to spend his time with. God she pisses me off. Its not just me either everyone that has had a close friendship or anything with him she gets jealous and like forbids them to come to her house. She kicked Josh out now she's working on me so he'll have no one but her. I hate it for her but she's in for a treat when we elope. I can't wait to hear the hell that's going to be unleashed from that event.

   Well she tried telling him that I couldn't come over anymore or spend the night. Kent said that I was no matter what. I still have a feeling I might not be staying with him this weekend. She told him today that she didn't have enough money in her checking account to pay for his gas to come get me anymore until he gets a job to pay for it himself. So me and him went all afternoon applying for jobs. Which I know we won't get any call backs. Well he might but I won't b/c I've never had a job and they will want experienced workers I'm sure. I hate this town so much. I wish one thing in my life could be simple. I always have the worst scenario of everything that occurs in my life. To add to it I think I'm getting another throat infection b/c my tounsils are all swollen and hurting and I think I'm allergic to latex : (    Well I guess that's all the important stuff for now. -Peace"

"event","Well I am tired as hell from walking til my bones started ripping through my skin at the zoo Saturday. For some reason the zoo was a lot more exciting when I seen it through my child eyes. The only cool thing that happened was watching the monkeys go crazy and they did this weird noise for about an hour. I watched a copperhead shed its skin. Anyway...I went to the huge ass mall in Nashville afterwards and I saw a bunch of shit I couldn't afford. That really pissed me off. I saw Green Day's two new t-shirts for the Warning album and I about had a fit. 
  Kent moved down for the summer so that's a great thing. The only problem is his mother is being a bitch already by trying to control where he goes and such. She just now made him go to Brilliant with her. Knowing her she's really taking him to another state so I can't talk to him for a long time. She enjoys torturing us like that. She hates me and I have done nothing but make her son happy. I'm sorry that he enjoys spending time with me. God, she irritates me. 
  I really don't want to live in that house with Kent b/c even though she doesn't live there she bought the place so I can't treat it like my home.  My life is going to be so shitty for the next couple of years. I wish I could at least have a friend around to talk to and such. Its awful just having your computer to keep you company at night. Maybe things will get better since Kent is back in town but his mother better not keep him from me. 
  Shit, I have to recite my speech for the wax museum tomorrow in front of everyone. I can't handle doing that. I'll panic and pass out. I hate public situations. I still don't know what I'm going to wear for a Tori outfit and I have to dress up Wed. I'm screwed. I'm sure I'll find something to put together. God, I'm going to have a heart attack tomorrow if Kent isn't home when I get home from school. I'll have anxiety all day worrying about it. Well I shall be going now to read my dear friend Jenny's journal. -Peace"

"event","I feel rather sad right now. Kent and I were discussing the whole job thing for this summer and it looks like its going to suck pretty bad. I want him to stay here with me so much. I can understand how he needs to stay up there though I suppose. I just really hope it doesn't make us grow distant. B/c we already don't see each other enough as it is. I can't handle less than I'm already getting. I'm going to flip the hell out if he gets a job and then I never see him or talk to him on the phone anymore. I just have to keep telling myself that October will be here soon. Then my life will be great finally. I don't have to be kept from my prince any longer. If anyone tries interfering I will kill them myself. There are so many concerts I'm wanting to go see right now.

   I'd like to go to the crawfish boil this weekend. I want to go see Our lady peace next month. I want to go to the warped tour in July. But guess what? I have to save every penny I get from here on out. Growing up is great. (hence the sarcasm). I can't believe In a week I'll be a senior that is so scary to me. For so long I remember seeing everyone else older than me in school and saying I can't wait til I get that big. Now that I'm that big I don't feel like I'm any older at all. It just sux really. The only great thing about it is going to be being with Kent. I really don't want to do that wax museum shit next week. I hate speaking in public. I'm pissed off at msn messenger. It decided to just delete everyone on my contact list tonight. I can't add anyone either for some reason. I guess I'll have to reinstall the stupid shit. I wish it would stop raining. I actually need a sunny day Sat. so I can go to the zoo. Well I'm going to write some poetry now. -Peace"

"event","For some reason the back of my head has been having sharp nerve pinching pains in it all day. I can't stand it. I can't even inhale deeply b/c it puts pressure on it and I want to scream. I wish Barry would stop calling me he's really starting to irritate me. He's constantly asking me to go do stuff with him outside of school. I keep having to make up things so I won't hurt his feelings. I'm sorry but I wouldn't miss Kent calling me just to hang out with him. I live for my phone calls from Kent. I hope so much that we go to the zoo this weekend. I really need to get out of this town. Plus I haven't been to the zoo since I was in kindergarten. I was so furious today when my stupid auto mechanics teacher told me I missed 11 days in his class so I couldn't exempt. We'll see about that. I WILL exempt. I really hope Kent is able to stay in town all summer. I want to spend as much time with him as possible. I wish my mom would just let me go ahead and move in with him but so much for that. My day will come soon enough I suppose. I just really hate being alone. Life just isn't fun by myself. God, now Pan is talking to me. I wish he'd make his mind up if he's going to be friends with me or not. I don't like being tossed around. If it weren't for music I don't know what I would do with myself. Tori is like the friend I never had and never will have. She never gives me any lip either. I just pop her in and listen to her advice. Why am I blabbing about this? Anywho...I need to get some quick case before the 25. I don't know how I'm going to afford Kent's b-day present I'm wanting to get him. I wish so much I could find a job around here. God there is nothing good about this shitty town. Well I will be going now to work on my project. -Peace"

"event","I really hate it when I put gel and mousse in my hair. I wash my hands and its still there. I went with Desiree this afternoon and stood by her side as she got her first tattoo. I thought it was great it made me really jealous though b/c I've been wanting one forever I just can't ever afford it. I want a faerie on my upper thigh and a sun with a face like on the Smashing Pumpkins infinite sadness c.d., on my shoulder blade. My mother irritated the shit out of me b/c she was saying she'd like to have my brother's face put on her. If he were still alive there would be no way in hell she would. Just like I'm alive and my sister is alive and she wouldn't put us on her unless we died. In my eyes that is saying I don't give a shit about you until you die. Which she didn't care about Erik until he died. She's a sad excuse for a mother. I have it recorded on cassette for her to not cry if I die before her b/c she hasn't given a damn about me while I'm alive and I don't want her acting like she does if I die. God I can't stand her. Thank god I'm moving out in October. I'm having to preregister for my classes for next year and I don't have a clue on what to take yet. I know I want to try and get all of Desiree's classes. Then again she'll just act like I'm not even there when her prep friends walk up to her. That's really sad when i've been friends with her for 8 years and and she would choose some stupid ass prep over me any day just b/c she wants to keep up a ""good"" image. I can't believe she made me move out of my locker just b/c her other friend told her I was ""weird"" and not like everyone else. I hope where ever I move to people are more like me so I can actually get along with someone. I can't talk to anyone around here. I just wish someone would listen to me. -Peace"

I'm wasting my precious time by writing here. I just need a break from thinking and I need to let my words flow. My little demon sister is screaming from the pits of hell that lie within her, she tries fighting off the parentals as they force medicine into her trembling stomach. Oh how I await the day of my leaving. My soul shall be overwhelmed with joy then. I won't know what to do with myself if I can actually be happy and free. My mother resembles Amanda from the Glass Managerie so much. No wonder Tennessee stayed drunk so much. Oh spoon man beat the rythym with my bones. Please save me. Although my friends aren't all indians. My ""friend"" was suppose to be on the net tonight to talk to me b/c he hasn't been here for me in a while. Guess what another broken promise as usual.

I am growing weary of the radio station I'm listening to so I think I'll put in my Led Zeppelin ""Physical Graffiti"" record. What has happened to music these days? Must a war occur (vietnam) in order for good music to be made again? Music use to have feeling and now its just, well....shit I guess you could call it. I feel so lonely at night. I look around me and realize that I have nothing or no one but my computer and my stereo. I feel saddened from this. Maybe in college this will change and people will be more open minded. God, how I hate xenophobic people. I really wish I had my Lilith Fair c.d. right now so I could listen to Suzanne Vega. Why must I torment myself with my own thoughts? Why must I have to write down my thoughts instead of having a friend that I could be talking to in person about these things? Oh well that's what I get for taking the ""path less taken.""

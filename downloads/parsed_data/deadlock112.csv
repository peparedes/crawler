I guess me being obliged to the restaraunt does make a deep impact of me. not being able to drive and all~ or having free time. man~ it sucks not having anything to look forward to.

so there was a few parties, and yes I did get drunk. but it was worth it. 

had a nice party at the restaraunt, they spent 1,000$ on food, almost ate all my fish at the bar. but it was worth it.

wow, looks like rib fest is comin up~ I'll be there sunday

Pricilla!!!!!! <33333333 good luck at ur prom tomorrow.

anyways~ julies dying of cancer and shes legally blind now. only a week left.................................. her message on my answering machine was overwelming.

restaraunt could be better, as usual, its kinda picking up. but not fast enough yet~ 

me and jessica broke up 2 nights ago. although it was mutual~ I still kinda worry about her, she seems a bit.., sad? with life.

so boa and some other of his friends came to my restaraunt. naturally, they were impressed.

               </3 you guys




 Nov 23, 2004

A Lakewood High School teacher who was assaulted by a student on Friday has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation into the incident.

Robert W. Britt, 35, an English teacher at the St. Petersburg school, received a letter Monday from the Pinellas school district's office of professional standards informing him that he has been suspended with pay effective Nov. 29.

""It's very hard to defend myself,"" Britt said. ""I don't know what my offense is, if anything. I was just trying to give my kids a chance to read and this happened.""

Britt, an ex-Marine who taught outside Boston for seven years before transferring to Pinellas in August, left his fifth-period English class about 11 a.m. Friday to investigate noise coming from the classroom next to his. With the teacher's approval, Britt took Tory Walker, 16, into the hallway to reprimand him.

When Walker began arguing with the teacher, Britt started to escort him to the front office. That's when things got out of hand, Britt said.

In a written statement, Britt wrote that Walker ""reached down and grabbed what appeared to be a sharp, metallic object and started to pull it out."" Britt kicked the object out of Walker's hand and his shoe ""brushed against the side"" of Walker's head. Another student picked up the object and began running, Britt wrote.

At that point, Britt said, Walker took off his belt and struck him repeatedly in the face and shoulders. Britt fled to a classroom until the school resource officer arrived.

St. Petersburg police charged Walker with battery on a School Board employee and took him to the juvenile assessment center.

Britt said he had heard nothing from the district until receiving the letter on Monday.

""The letter says allegations were made against me,"" he said. ""The letter does not say what they are.""

District officials could not be reached for comment Monday.

Lakewood principal Fred Ulrich said that Walker would ""be disciplined to the fullest extent of the code of conduct."" Ulrich said the school will review its options, but Walker ""will not be attending Lakewood High School any longer.""

The principal said he could not comment on Britt's situation.

""The investigation is being completed and a recommendation for any followup will come from the Office of Professional Standards,"" Ulrich said. ""It's been referred to them.""

"event","yeah so life blows with dear old chuck here. so i go out on a limb and tell him i like him, i finally get his viewpoint on the matter and he says he doesn't want to ruin our friendship. which i guess i could see cause were so close. and he does have this little tendency to cheat on his girlfriends and then they get all fucked up relationshipwise, but he wouldn't even tell me if he liked me. so grr... then friday he takes me to work. we walked to his house from school and he drives me to work at the appropriate time, mind you he has no liscense and he has a broken arm, well elbow. so he's driving one armed. i get out of the truck and he tells me,"" have a good day at work, I love you!"" yeah, so i've heard him say these three little words a thousand times, but it really sucked to hear him say it then especially since it was thursday he told me no dating for us. but today long three hour conversation over the phone, he asked me to marry him, ha ha ha joke. as of about two hours agao, we were officially engaged. he wants to have a dumb little wedding and all. but he first said i was his wife no questions asked and i had no choice in the matter, but i told him i had no little ring on me finger, we didn't have a wedding, and we didn't even get engaged. so he reasked me i told him no, but then gave into a yes. and he's gonna make up one of those really cheesy pet names really weird and in love people call each other, and hes gonna make sure everyone knows i'm his fiance. and blah blah blah. sucks. he doesn't want to date me, but we can be married, and he told me about a thousand times, no lie, that he loved me. and now we share stuff, its not mine or his its ours. my puppy, ours. my monmey, ours, um except not. the half of each check i'm saving for when i move out into a place of my own, hopefully a house, will be ours. he even decided when i get my room reorganized and take the bunk bed out and oput a queen/king in to take up my room, but for more people to sleep capacity, that he's gonna come over every night to sleep in my bed, but he'll be invisible to me parents, and he'll hide under the bed to help him be unseen. great huh. i have no problem with him sleeping in my bed, but i'm sure he won't want to sleep in it the way i want him to. its kinda rough to hang out with him everyday and know we can't have nothing. he's not weirded out, its like he's trying to make me like him more. trying to get me to hang out wih him more and talk to him more and write him more and so on and such. were really close, and i don't want to loose our friendship. cause he means a lot to me. silly thing him me and his best friend Aj, whom i also like, but not as much as Charlie, all have a dumb death pact, that we'll all die together, with the way they live their lives sometimes, i worry if we'll make it to our graduation. even funnier story, mom met Aj and Cjarlie, loved them, Aj kept grabbing me around the waste and holding me, wrapping his arms around me and placing his head on my shoulder, in front of my mom, and tells her i'm his girlfriend. jerk!!!! i hate him! he did this like three time in like two days not this last weekend but the one before. oh he told the people at subway as well as my mom, and the people at wendys as well as gail, and my dad. for those who know my dad canonly imagine how well my dad responded to me prying Aj off me as me and gail run to my moms truck to get away from them and then Aj shouting ""I love you girlfriend. I'll call you tonight baby."" much hate and anger rose off me padre and out upon me and gail. man oh man he threatened him, said he was ugly and that i'd have better taste. not realizing of course that Aj is erin's cousin and the son to a man my father probably knew a long time ago. oh and Aj has a girlfriend. the way the damn kid acts around me you'd think we were dating. he's always throwing his arms around me, trys to dance with me, tackles me into the grass ond such and trys and does hump my head, tells me he loves me, tells me i'm his girlfriend. and yet he has a g/f, his last one i didn't like so i didn't mind him being like that to me, but this new one, i guess is a good friend of charlies too i've heard her talk once, she seems kewl, so i don't exactly let him get away with it. but its hard when thats our friendship, the pretend oh let me hump you thing, but have no emotions like that for you. well yeah i've bitched enough. but its nice to get this off me chest."

"event","I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION LIFE SUCKS. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO OR SAY ANYMORE. EVERYTIME YOU THINK THINGS WON'T GET WORSE YOU HAPPEN TO WAKE UP EARLY ONE MORNING TO OVER HEAR YOUR MOTHER TALKING ON THE PHONE WITH YOUR DAD, TELLING HIM ABOUT WHAT THE DOCOTR TOLD HER AND HOW SCARED SHE IS, AND HOW IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE THOUGHT IT'D BE. AND YOU NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HEARING THIS CAN ONLY THINK. THEN YOU GET A CALL FROM YOUR GRANDMA ASKING TO TALK TO YOUR MOM BECAUSE SOMETHING SERIOUS HAS COME UP. WHILE YOU TRY TO STAY QUIET AS NOT TO ERIN AND IAN WHO ARE ASLEEP ON THE COUCHES. YOUR MOM FREAKS OUT. AFTER SHE GETS OFF THE PHONE SHE CALLS YOUR DAD TO TELL HIM HIS SON IS COMING HOME ANS HAS BEEN HJOMELESS FOR THREE DAYS AND HAS NO MONEY. THEN YOU GET TO HEAR ALL ABOUT HOW HIS 17 YEAR OLD WIFES PARENTS THREW HIM TO THE STREETS CAUSE THEY COULDN'T STAND HIS ""GOTH"" LOOK. BUT QUESTIONS ARISE. SEE WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED THE WEEK BEFORE, HER MOM WAS HERE IN RENO WITH HER AND HAD TO LEGALLY SIGN FOR HER TO GET MARRIED AND HAD TO LEGALLY BE THERE TO WITNESS OR WHATEVER, SO SHE KNEW HOW HE LOOKED CAUSE THEY DAY THEY GOT HITCHED HE WAS IN THE SAME CRAP HE WENT UP THERE IN. SO I'M A LITTLE CONFUED. WHICH MEANS HE LIED OR SHE LIED OR THEY BOTH LIED SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE. GRR I HATE PEOPLE. AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE GREG LEFT ME FOR WISCONSIN. BIG TEAR, I HAD HIM CALL ME JUST BEFORE HE LEFT SO I COULD SAY GOODBYE. 8:06 HEY I'M LEAVING NOW. BIG SIGH, O.K. HAVE FUN STAY SAFE. I WILL. HOW ARE YOU. O.K. GOOD. I HAVE TO GO NOW, SORRY. DON'T SWEAT IT, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND AM GONNA MISS YOU LIKE HELL. I KNOW. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH TOO. SEE SOON, I PROMISE (TEARS FALL) LOOK I'M CRYING. I'M SORRY, I KNOW YOU WILL BUT I HAVE TO GO, WISH I DIDN'T. OK, BYE. BYE. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU TOO. THAT WAS OUR LOVELY CONVERSATION. BIG TEAR. BUT HES SO SWEET HE TEXTED ME TO UPDATE ME ON HOW FAR HE GOT EACHDAY AND I GOT TO TEXT HIM FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS SATURDAY. GAVE HIM A LITTLE HOPE OF NOT BEING THE ONLY ""PUNK"" IN MADISON WISCONSIN. WHICH I HAVE TO LOOK UP TODAY. BUT HIS DAD DROPPED HIS CELL IN A SLURPEE SO HE COULDN'T TALK OR TEXT NO MORE. HE CALLED ERIN'S PHONE CAUSE HE KNOWS HER # BY HEART AND WANTED HER TO RELAY TO ME THAT HE GOT THERE SAFE AT ABOUT 10 AT NIGHT SUNDAY. I MISS HIM LOTS. I WISH I COULD HAVE GONE WITH HIM INSTEAD OF BE HERE IN THIS HELL HOLE I CALL A HOME. SATURDAY ALAN CALLED. WE TALKED FOR TWO HOURS ROUGHLY. HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE I WAS OK AND KNEW HE WASN'T IGNORING ME WHEN HE DIDN'T CALL ME BACK THE THREE DAYS I CALLED BEFORE. HE HAD TO WAIT TILL 9 SO HIS PARENTS WOULD BE IN BED, CAN'T TAK ON THE PHONE AFTER 7, WEIRD I KNOW. WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING. ABOUT GREG, CHRIS, US. THERES SO MUCH HE DIDN'T KNOW AND NEEDED FILLED IN. BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL HIM I LOVE HIM. SEEMS WEIRD TO SAY IT ESPECIALLY SINCE HE HAS A G/F!! BUT HE FINALLY DRAGGED IT OUT OF ME. AND BOY HE WAS SHOCKED. FUNNY ALL HE COULD SAY WAS HE WAS SORRY. WE TALKED ABOUT WHY WE EVER STARTED EVEN TALKING, CAUSE I HATED HIM IN THE BEGINNING. I WANTED HIM TO JUST DISAPPEAR. BUT HE GREW ON ME. AND HIS CONSTENT FAKE FLIRTING WITH ME GREW TO BECOME REAL FLIRTING AND SO ON AND SUCH. I'M SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE MUSHY CRAP. I DON'T. TALKED ABOUT HIS NEW JOB. HIS NEW CHICK. ALL HIS EXS. BUT MOSTLY US. NEITHER OF US TRUELY CAME OUT TO SAY IT OR ASK IT, BUT WE SURE WERE GONNA BE TOGETHER WHEN HIM AND WHATS HER NAME ARE OVER. ITS JUST IMPLIED. EVEN THOUGH I WAS SAYING HOW I NEEDED TO GET COMPLETELY OVER HIM, ITS STILL IMPLIED. WHICH SCARES ME. I DID WRONG. TELLING HIM I DIDN'T WANT TO DATE HIM WHEN I FOUND OUT SHE ASKED HIM OUT, MIND YOU HE DIDN'T ASK I JUST TOLD HIM. TELLING HIM I DIDN'T MIND HIM DATING HER IF HE WANTED TO. TRYING TO PROTECT MYSELF FROM FALLING IN LOVE WITH HIM. AND TELLING HIM I LOVE HIM WHEN HE HAS A G/F. EVEN IF HE DID HAVE TO HEAR IT. SADLY, I THINK ITS ACCTULLY TIME TO MOVE ON. I LOVE HIM, I CAN'T HELP THAT NOW. BUT ITS TIME TO OPEN UP AND GIVE OTHER PEOPLE A SHOT AT BREAKING ME HEART. THATS WHAT I'VE DECIDED. EVEN IF WE GO BACK TO BEING HOW WE WERE. IT WON'T LAST LONG, IT NEVER DOES. I CAN'T TAKE MUCH MORE. I DON'T WANT TO. RODEO IS GONNA BE HERE, AND FOR SOME REASON I REALLY WANT TO GO. MAYBE I'LL MAKE CHARLIE TAKE ME, SINCE HE LOVES THE RODEO. MAKE HIM BE MY SUGAR DADDY FOR ONCE, HA RIGHT. WELL YEAH I THINK I'VE PUSHED OUT ENOUGH FOR A WEEK OF NOT WRITING."

"event","so yeah haven't been here in days. and you can tell.ummm where to start, chris, my oldest brother got married tuesday night!!! to a 17 year old girl named jamie at a quick chapel place down by rainshodow and one of the washoe high schools. she's in washington right now and he will go up there to live with her on thursday. the day also when greg leaves. the day i die because greg leaves. then friday i talked to alan. told him i stopped talking to him cause i was afraid i might yell at him because i was hurt that he said yes and started dating that amanda girl. and i didn't and don't think he did anything wrong, because i told him i was o.k. with it, and i thought i would be, but smart ashley knew better and warned me. i asked if he was mad or hated me for acting kinda dumb and being kiddish like that. he said he cares about me to much to hate me or be super mad at me!!! i kinda love him, which sucks. he was afraid i stopped talking to him cause i thought that he only used me to give him head, but i knew that wasn't the case. he's still with amanda who he only sees once a week at church on monday nights. i hate that, and i'm jealous. and i'm never jealous. he told me he wasn't gonna have sex with me just because were cool again, after exchanging words about it i rememebred he still has a g/f, and told him we couldn't talk baout such things no more, he laughed and said no more sex and penis talk for you. oh and i guess the only reason i went back and apologized and tried to make a mense is because i want his penis and can't resisit the power of it!!! he he he he he he!! he wishes!!! but i did not tell him the most important thing, the thing i will haveto tell him, or at least i think i should, but i don't want to yet cause he has a chick, i love him, not full hearted, but like the half hearted semi-begining of relationship love, the kind that hurts a lot when 
you've been broken!! well yeah, i've come to terms that i like ian again. i hate that so much. because erin likes him and flirts mad core with him, i think i'm gonna tell her to stay away, not because i want something to be between us, and i don't think he likes her, its just its like a stab to the heart when i see her flirt with him and always follow him into the trailer to go talk alone or when she told him to give her a lap dance yesterday on the bus and he goes its just cause you want to see my penis and she said she did. i know she was semi serious about it, but i don't know if he knew that. and like she was takling to her friend david, and he decided to be funny and hit on me over the phone, and she goes you ever touch him and if he ever touches you i'm going after the both of you and then i'm go be with one of your friends. so i think i'll do that to her, cause i care a lot about him, and ever since he brought up the past of us, i've been pondering it a lot, and i used to think he was my world, i thought i was honestly going to be with him for forever. right amanda??? yep! well a congrats to mindy, amanda autmn, jenney, ""superman"", kori, pat(<3), aundrey, ian(you will be there), alison, and who ever else i may be forgetting."

"event","Alan has a g/f. Told him it was o.k. didn't think it'd hurt, but I cried. And regretted it just like Ashley said I would. It's funny how well she knows me. You'd think I would know more about me, but she does. I love that about her!! I love you Ashley and thanks for being by my side through all of this. It hurt. We don't talk, I feel bad cause I have nothing to say without breaking down and either crying or yelling, and he did nothing wrong in my eyes. But everyone says he did. I was told that they thought he was just using me to get what he wanted. I think in a way he was, but then again not really. He won't even talk to me, he barley even looks at me. Its hard. but its life. I think a break in the friendship is much needed! I still care a lot about him, but enough is enough Gail says. She's putting her foot down and refusing to let me ""be"" with him again. She doesn't want him near me, but I can't let her do that. Erin's going to help, she's too funny, but then again, she never liked him anyway. And he'd only pretend to like her and pretend to care. Funny how things don't work out when you try for them. But truthfully, after a week of thought (dating her since last thursday)I've come to the conclusion, its better for us to not be anything but friends. We had fun and I don't regret what I did and what we did, I wanted to date him he wasn't ready, he was ready for a g/f, and I made it clear I didn't want to be more than friends with benefits at the moment. So, what else could happen, he got an offer from an ex, I'm not gonna be the person that steps in the way and says no, especially when I have full intension of doing stuff with Rick when we met up. And I guess that's why I couldn't be with Alan as a g/f. Cause I know things would happen and I don't want to cheat and regret hurting Alan, and I don't want to regret doing things with Rick. But I also don't want to not do things with him and regret being like I like you lets go do whatever and then be like on no we can't I'm hooked up. Rick thought the whole thing was funny. I didn't tell him why I didn't want to date Alan but I know he probably knows, he's not dumb. He laughed at things that happened between me and Alan, and how Alans view on sex w/me changed when he decided he didn't want to be my first in case it was bad and I regretted it. I laughed buit respected it. Just like he respected when I said I didn't want to till I was ready. Even though he asked everyday to piss me off cause he thinks I look cute when I'm mad. 
Anyways, Ian is now a new memeber of our happy family. He lives in the trailer outside so my evil people hating dog doesn't bite him. Rude jackass, I hate when he wakes me up. Hella pissed me of monday my storming in yelling something leaving two seconds later coming back in with Frank and yelling wake up wake up wake up wake up an bunch of times and then finally lefty when I screamed at them to get out or I'd shank them both in the eye with a pen. And this morning he decides he wants to knock on my door a thousand times. I could kill him. He hits me, makes fun of me, and won't quit talking about how we used to be everytime I say I hate him. He goes that's not how you used to feel. And like last night I had my mom buy cherry coke cause it's mine and Ian's favorite I remember that from when he used to steal my cherry cokes over last summer. And I told him and asked if it was his favorite, and he goes yeah bet ya didn't know that when we were dating. I just looked at him and go no, and there was a lot of stuff I didn't know and you didn't know. And he goes yeah cause I didn't really care to. What a fucking retard. He made up the trailer all nice and stuff. He made it home. My mom, who's sick with walking nemonia, looked at it shook her head and walked away. She didn't even say he could move into it, she just said she might put him in there and he hella moved in. Got the walls and roof covered with flyers and posters and all kinds of stuff, oh and ninja turtle paper plate and napkin as well!! Got his amp and bass put where he wants it. He's a retard cause we were trying to get his amp to work, and it wouldn't and then he realized he forgot to like press something or turn something on in the back. He bass is ugly. Not a pretty guitar at all. He got a kitten from Gail and calls it mooch. But its still at Gails. So as you can tell lifes just a peach.
charlie browns cute with his hawk down and gail finally sees his cuteness. he's a retard and jacked my phone yesterday. it kept falling out of my pocket and i put it in gails purse, and she goes i'm not your bitch. charlie goes i'll be your bitch and puts it in his pocket. aww how sweet i thought. then i forgot he had it. and i saw him right before i needed to be in class. so i asked for it back he says no he'll give it to me later and takes off running. he tried calling people and texting people with my phone. I got it back after school. but not from him cause when i went up to him for it, our friend daid took it and ran off and all charlie couls say was, i would have given it to you but the fat bastard took it. I got it back. but without the help of charlie. who's hawk i still need to dye. he never calls me back when i leave him messages. he's the best to talk to on the phone. i talked to him on the bus last friday when i was sitting with alan and i felt all weird and akward, but alan didn't seem to notice. charlie was yelling at people through my phone for everyone to shut up. but he got mad at hearing them and made me call him back the second i got in the door. but he got on the phone for like an hour and a half and i couldn't get through. he thought i wouldn't call him. so when i finally got through we talked and watched t.v. together. I like talking to him, he cheers me up. he's a really great guy, and i hate how he's gotten treated here at north valleys. sucks. and he lost some new friends he made cause he dated one of them and cheated on her with her best friend, but it was all charlies fault. ya know. the girl didn't kiss him back. they only made out. and now his ex has it out for me and erin. erin not so much because they all see her as charlies cousin casue her cousin is his best friend. but we hung out with im the day he got back from being suspended for two weeks and she glared at us and followed us around. dumb bitch don't get jealous just casue you still want his nuts. and then to fucking throw bad looks his way when we went to 7 seconds. grrr... fucking every time he saw her and the rest of them doing that, he'd walk away from me and erin. I got pissed and told him you need to fucking stop being afraid or emabrassed to be around us just cause that dumb wench is here. if you don't stop, it'll be me you have to worry about. especially since i'm holding your jacket and i've given you and your friend money. so stop. he was taken back. but he stopped. then when i went to buy him a water so he'd stop jacking erin's, she went up and got in his face and went off on him and walked away. it made me mad cause she was up in his face, i know she has a right to be mad and hate him, but to be a bitch just because she's jealous of us is not right. he wouldn't say what she said. all he said was shes kinda manly and beast like. which is just like him, cause he's not a big shit talker like evryone else. well i've typed enough so later days"

We laid in his bed for a while, I wished it didn't have to end and I didn't have to go home. He's a wonderful kisser, and it was nice to lay there in his arms. I persuaded him to give me a back rub. I'd kiss him and say please then kiss him again and say please and so on and so forth!!! He's too cute about it. He did the same thing when he was asking me for something, he's too cute!! He gave a wonderful back rub!! Other stuff happened that's not need to be spilled, but it was what we needed. We really needed a day to be alone, well he brothers were home, but we weren't bothered. We talked, seriously. in a very serious manner, and what's soo great about it is he started the conversation!! I loved it!! I swear, sometimes i don't know what ever comes over me and makes me want to give up and say we need to not be anything and just leave it at that. Days like yesterday, shows me he does care and want to be with me, or at least have me around. A lot of good stuff but it was a good day and a good step in the right direction!!!"

"event","Yesterday I was in the worst mood ever. Rick, he's one of my best friend Erins friends. We talk practically everyday on the phone. Oh I love this kid. Were supposed to meet this weekend!!! I', excited I don't know how or when, I know my parents won't like me going to meet an 18 year old guy I've never met, but what they don't know won't hurt them. So yesterday, I was mad as heck, and depressed and stuff. And I was supposed to call Alan and talk to him, but I guess his phone was off, it made me mad as hell. So, I called Rick, haven't talked to him since like last thursday. So I called him up, and all I said was Rick, and he could tell by the tone of my voice I was upset, so he goes spill it. I love him!!! You could barely tell by the sound of my voice, but he could. I love how he makes me laugh. And how he cheers me up and just how cute he is. I guess hes ugly, but I don't care, I love his personality. It makes me sad that in about a month or so he's going to go to Michigan, I think that's where he'll be staitioned. Anyways he's going to military training for 9 weeks, then he's gonna be an army police officer. I'm gonna die when he leaves. He's sweet, kind of a perve, but sweet. He's funny, I told him I was gonna kick his ass, he said it'd turn him on!!! he he he he he!!! He's too cute, why does everytime I tell a guy I'm gonna kick their ass, they go careful it might turn me on?!?!?! Dirty boys. Even my not so legal boyfriend told me that when I said I'd punch him if he tried to make me eat his bogger, then he persisted to tell me it's turn him on and then I'd be in trouble then cause there'd be no hiding, I told him I'd lock my self in the bathroom, my bathroom has a lock on it. Then he said no door can hold him back. Funny kid, he's my not so legal boyfriend cause he's 18 and I'm 15, one word JAILBAIT. We're not acctually dating its just pretend. But anyways back on Rick. It's funny how he dececided we should met. I said something, and he goes spank. I laughed at him. And he goes shut up or I'll spank you, I laughed again and said I'd like to see you try. He gets all excited and says oh and open invitation? I said sure I'd like to see ya try. Then he ok. that's it were meeting this weekend!!! I said sure. i think I'll call him at break since he likes to get up at 6 am even though he doesn't have to. I made him laugh so hard it was funny, he also got a bit confused!! He did the growl/roar thing that the hult does, and I said ooooh Rick, and he goes what and starts laughing and goes wow that was akward. I laughed at him. He's to cute. A little sexual but cute. He hates it when I call him cute. But when he gets all ""fake"" mad about it, it only makes him cuter. Why is that? Why does when someone gets mad or angry, do they seem cuter??? Alan loves to just piss me off cause he thinks I'm the cutest when I'm mad. Rick like to do the same thing, but not to get me super pissed as alan does, he likes getting me mad so I'll tell him I'll kick his ass or give him a swift kick in the ass, like yesterday, he goes that's right get mad, now we can have hot passiontite angry sex!! he he he he!! What a bum. I know how much of a little school girl I sound so I'm done."

                          I'm yours, you can hold me
                          I'm empty and achin' 
                          And tumblin' and breakin'

                          Cause you don't see me
                          And you don't need me
                          And you don't love me 
                          The way I wish you would
                          The way I know you could

                          I dream a world where you understand
                          That I dream a million sleepless nights
                          Well I dream a fire when you're touching my hand
                          But it twists into smoke when I turn on the lights

                          I'm speechless and faded
                          It's too complicated
                          Is this how the book ends,
                          Nothing but good friends?

                          Cause you don't see me
                          And you don't need me
                          And you don't love me
                          The way I wish you would

                          The way I wish you would

                          This is the place in my heart
                          This is the place where I'm falling apart 
                          Isn't this just where we met
                          And is this the last chance that I'll ever get

                          I wish I was lonely
                          Instead of just only
                          Crystal and see-through
                          And not enough to you

                          Cause you don't see me
                          And you don't need me
                          And you don't love me
                          The way I wish you would

"event","Got mad at Alan yesterday. I'm sick of everyone asking why I'm ""jealous"" of him and g/f. So, I wrote  him an angry letter setting him straight. Frank thought I've finally given up and excepted I'm ""jealous"" and that I still ""like"" him. Ha he wishes. Alan wouldn't even look at me this morning when he got on the bus. Some where down deep feels bad and does wish all was back to how it should be, how it was. 
I realized something scary this morning when I was contemplating the last tow and a half weeks. Will looks like Mikey. To those who grew up with me know him and know the importance he's played in my life since we were just little kids. I couldn't figure out why I felt so safe with Will. Especially since I don't know anything about him except that's he a total flake and tweaker. He brought back a safe feeling I haven't felt in a while. I finally figured it was the safe feeling Mikey gave me, well not it exactly, but close. So, now that I'm totally taken back, I'm glade I haven't seen him since last Monday. I don't want a fake feeling. I liked him yeah, but I guess I don't expect less with all these emotions flying around because of Alan. 
Now I feel more lost than I ever have. Why do I have to be so stubborn and stupid? I'm sick of everything here. I need a long vacation. Finally convinced mom it's o.k. for me to get my permet now at 15. She thinks she's going to make me wait till I'm 18 to get my liscence. Dad thinks she's crazy and that the real reason is cause she doesn't want me getting it before dumb and dumber (frank and chris). I need a helping hand. Someone please help pull me out of my own broken heart and sorrow. Have you ever felt so alone in such a crowded place? Like my lameass school. It's funny not much of anything my friends say to cheer me up helps. I feel like their just offering their charity of lies and expressions. Such bullshit. Such bullshit."

BUT I GOT OFF THE BUS TO BE TOTALLY SURPRISED BY MY NEW SWEETHEART WILL. HE WALKED ALTHOUGH UP THE STREET TO GREET ME. I WAS SHOCKED. AFTER I GOT WHAT I NEEDED DONE, WE WERE SITTING IN THE TRAILER (FOR CAMPING BUT CHRIS G/F LIVES OUT THERE CAUSE SHE'S ALLERGIC TO OUR CATS AND DOGS)AND CHRIS MADE SURE WE WERE ALONE. WE STARTED TALKING, HE SAID I WAS BEAUTIFUL!!!!! WE STARTED MAKING OUT. WE WENT FROM SITTING ON ONE OF THE BEDS TO A LAYING DOWN POSTION. WE CUDDLED AND SAT THERE, WE ALMOST FELL ASLEEP IN EACHOTHERS ARMS. THERE WAS GROPING, WHICH SO HAPPENED TO SEND STEPHANIE(CHRIS'S G/F) BACK INTO THE HOUSE WHEN SHE CAME TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE NOTHING ""BIG"" WAS HAPPENEING. THEN ME AND STEPH WENT TO STEAD SO SHE COULD APPLY AT THIS PLACE, WE CAUGHT A RIDE DOWN THERE FROM MY FRIEND SAMANTHA. THEN WE WALKED BACK. I MUST SAY NEVER WALK FROM STEAD TO LEMMON VALLEY IN BOOTS THAT ARE NOT MEANT FOR A ""GOOD"" DISTANCE WALKING. MY FEET ARE STILL KILLING ME. WE GOT HOM AT 5:30. CHRIS AND WILL WERE IN THE TRAILER. I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE JOINING THEM SO I WAS SITTING ON THE COUCH. WILL CAME IN AND PUT A PILLOW IN HIS LAP SO I COULD LAY DOWN AND HE HELD ME AND WE JUST WATCHED T.V. WITH FRANK. THEN WE MOVED FROM THE COUCH TO BOTH LAYING DOWN ON THE LOVE SEAT. THEN WE MOVED TO A STANDING POSTION OF MOUTH NUMBING MAKINGOUT IN THE KITCHEN, THEN TO THE GARAGE FOR BETTER PRIVACY. WERE THINGS BECAME UNBOTTONED AND UNZIPPED. I SWEAR I WAS SO CLOSE TO JUAT FUCKING HIM, BUT I WAS A GOOD GIRL AND SAID NO. HE WAS FINE WITH THAT. I MUST SAY HE HAS A BIG PENIS! BUT SHHHHH!! HE'S ALSO VERY GOOD WITH HIS HANDS. BUT SHHH ON THAT TOO! IF MOM AND DAD WERE TO FIND OUT, OOOHHHH I'D BE KILLED FOR SURE. THAT'S HOW IT WORKS WHEN YOU HAVE STRICK OVER PROTECTIVE PARENTS.

In the face of shock i said yes. WHY?!?!?!?!?!?!? I now fear she will ask me to be the maid of honor, she keeps pushing the idea of needing one on me, but I keep pushing her to just pick one of her best buds.

But she still sleeps with the light on,
And she acts like its alright on,
As she smiles again,
Then her mother lies there sick with cancer,
And her friends don't understand her,
She's a question without answers,
Who feels like falling apart,
She knows she so much more than worthless,
She needs to find a puporse,
She wonders what she did to deserve this,and,

She's calling out to you,
This is a call,
This is a call out,
Cause everytime I fall down,
I reach out to you,
And I'm losing all control now,
And the hazard signs are roll out,
I'm asking you to show me what this life is all about,

And he tells everyone a story,
Cause he thinks his life is boring,
And he fights so you won't ignore him,
Cause that's his biggest fear,
And he cries,
But you rarely see him do it,
And he loves but he's scared to use it,
So he hides behind the music,
Cause he likes it that way,
And he knows he's so much more than worthless,
He needs to find a surface,
Cause he's starting to get nervous,and,

He's calling out to you,

Have you ever felt this way before,
Cause I don't want to hide here anymore,
Take me to a place where nothings wrong,
And thanks for coming shut the door,
And they say someone out there sees us,
Then if your real then save me Jesus,
Cause I've been this way for far too long,
I wasn't meant to feel alone,

And now I'm calling out to you,
This is a call,

Those are the lyrics to the song I'm listening to. I can realte to so much of it, it's scary. It also reminds me of my friend Aimee and her ex Timmy's problems. And Melinda can relate same with Ash. If you ever want to see the ""rare"" emo side of me, well here it is. It's kind of scaryy how life sends you little ""gifts"" such as this. Life's gone to hell. I hate school life, being the third wheel ain't workin' no more. Home life sucks, I hate that my older smelly brother and his girlfriend moved in. I hate having to share a room. I hate not getting privacy. I hate I have no where to escape. I hate how I'm left to pick up after everyone. Even the new memebers of our happy little home. I hate being stuck with everything. I hate it. I hate having to deal with dumb boys who play fucking dumbass games. I hate that the only escape I get is sleep. I wish I could just walk out the door and never ever come back. Ever, just walk till I have no where to walk. I hate my brother. I cut him out of my life, and now I have to bite my tounge and live with him cause he can't keep a job and afford to live on his own, and no one else will take him in cause he's a fucking mucher. I can't yell at him, so I have nothing to say to him except to quit leaving his dirty clothes all over our living room, quit lieing to my mom, quit leaviing food on our $2,000 dollar couches, take showers, put on deoderant, brush his teeth, to do something than sit on his ass playing video games all day, and so on a such. I feel like I'm his mom or something. I don't need to, but if I don't say it no one will till my mom and dad explode. I've screamed my head off, but no one heard my cry. Every angry tea has been shed, I have no more to cry. I can't even sit down and help my friends in need cause I'm stressed behond belief. I can only offer a listening ear and two phone numbers to call to spill all. How useless I am. I hate this. I don't want to be here anymore. My heart calls out for another place where I need to find. Home is not here anymore, not in my heart at least. I feel like a stranger in my own world. Amongest my own friends and family. Like I'm sitting there watching it all, from outside my body. It's toooo much. I can't take much more. I just can't."

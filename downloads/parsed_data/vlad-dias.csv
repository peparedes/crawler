"event","Hello All,
I'm back, I drank myself stupid last night. I went to the park, and we got chased by the cops, boy how fun that was. After that we went to Andrew's, they left me on the matresses he has at across the street, and my friend Tori found me in my friend Andrew's truck, how I got there, I don't know. Anyway this morning I woke up and I saw pink, then I saw thongs, a boa, girly things, and I thought Where The Fuck Am I? So I was looking around, it was about 7 and Tori said, ""Good Morning, here some tynlenol and it made my headache go away. I didn't have a clue how I got to Tori's. But I gotta go cause I have some filming to do today for our Jackass video so until next time, Remember Sex is fun and live life to the fullest.

"event","It's early, I feel miserable. I don't want to go to class but I will. I realized I always go for the girl I can never get, or the physco girl who used to say we could never be together, now wants to be with me. I am feeling really lonely. I didn't want to wake up this morning. Spring is supposed to be the time that everything is in full bloom, especially love. Love right now is being a bitch, by not let me getting it or it just doesn't want me to be happy.
Hopefully one day these dark clouds turn into sunshine in my depressing soul, and something good happens.

"event","I finally decided to update. Nothing new has changed. Just getting more lonely as the days proceed. Still longing for my angel. Last time i wrote i had a girlfriend, she cheated on me with her ex and is now engaged. It made me mad, because I know her ex beats her, but I guess she doesn't need my help.                          Until Later,

"event","I don't know where to start. Valentines' as usual sucked. I watched wrestling. I have a paper to write. I never get enough sleep. Nothing really matters right now. I have errands to run, and no-one to love. This day has to produce something good. I want to yell, but I can't. Maybe I should go, get something to eat, drink some tea, then just listen to my lounge music. I just want to do something, anything! Why is it when I fall for someone they already have someone or they're married? Better sign off before I start ranting or complaining. 
            Until either I have some better news,or a miracle happens,

"event","Monday is an hour away from being over. Classes were boring as usual. I had dinner with my sister and my mom. Just settling down for bed. Relax, something that is difficult to achieve, for me, that is. What dreams enter my head tonight? I haven't got a clue.  Will tomorrow bring sunshine or rain? Will I find the girl of my dreams or will I take my last breath? Either way, I need not to worry because tomorrow is already here, and today will always be tomorrow's yesterday.
                                   I bid you all who read this good night:

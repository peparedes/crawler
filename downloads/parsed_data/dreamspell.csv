So what's the deal with Rent (-ahem-Luke?)?  As far as I know, I'm still going early early early with Kathy and that group.  I talked to Tyler but I have to get back to him on the specifics since now Luke might be going with us....which doesn't really change anything, except whether he can go early (times 3) WITH us.

I dunno.




hm.



la la la. not much to say, I just like typing right now.  Have you ever been in a mood where you just want to type and type and type and it's just the boredom plus the action of typing that's somewhat entertaining and methodic and comforting?  yeah....

i'm tired and cold. but not too much of both. just a little. a very little. 


yeah.


my dad is being stubborn about going to Rehab (since he had heart surgery). He says it's not only because of the money (how much it costs), and that it's other things too (like he's ready to go back to work)... but i dunno.... I  just think he's being stupid about it.  He's come this far and he's just STOPPING!  I mean, just because he feels okay doesn't mean he is!  He needs to go to Rehab and just fully get recovered. gar! gah! gub! eerg.  some people, like my family. pheh!

rant? sorry.

blah. snow sucks. im in no mood excerise like i did in the summer...and i'm gaining weight because of that. man, im stupid. well, my internet addiction and my office job don't help either.

oh, not long until Gypsy (refer to entry below). Whoot!  yesssss.  I hear Brendan V. is Mama Rose's dresser.  Smartness.  I can't wait. I will probably like get someone so random and minute to dress. Although I hear that the Farm/Newsboys (not sure which group if not both), all come off at the same time at one point and all need dressers...  Luuuuuuuuke, I could be your dresser then!  We'll see! :o)

okay i should go. I could go on and on and on....but I won't. maybe later.

Don't worry.  There will be a training session for this show.  Because it is a high dresser show - Brendon VanStee is planning on doing a training session just for the dressers.
 
I don't think you need to be too concerned.  You will do just fine.

Hi, Mary Jo,
When I was talking to some of my Civic friends and after some thinking, I was concerned about the quick changes in Gypsy.  While I have some dresser experience, it's not as *extensive* as many other people's experiences. I don't want anyone to be misled that I have tons and tons of dressing experience, when it's actually minimal in comparison.  I just wanted you to know that so you have that in mind while calling people.  This worries me because I STILL want to crew this show, regardless. 
 
Talk to you soon,
Amie Bajalieh"

"event","So...what the heck?  Should I even be CREWING ""Gypsy""? It's almost all quick changes and I'm NOT one of the top dressers Civic has.  So the best dressers are Val, Kylie, Linda and Kathy and I know for sure Kathy is doing the whole run.  So, that leaves the need for at least 5 more good dressers.  Ugh.  I emailed MJ DeNolf to let her know that I have dressing experience but NOT TONS of it.   I will cry my eyes out if she says she doesn't need me to crew then.  But I had to be honest.  I never lied to her, but when she asked if I had dressing experience, I said, ""yes.""  Because I do. 

I'm worried now and I'm talking to Kathy M. who is never really reassuring about ANYTHING.  Kylie is more reassuring that she. GEEZ.

Forgot to mention, I just saw ""Spider-Man"" last night and it was AWESOME! I can't wait until the sequels come out.

Tobey was excellent as Peter/Spidey. Mad props to you, TB! You are seriously on fire!

Kirsten as MJ was of course, stellar. 

Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin was sweet, but very scary!

I think I'm a converted Spidey fan-I mean more so now, then ever! If you haven't seen, GO SEE IT! If you HAVE seen it, whatdidja think?!

Hope to hear from ya soon!

Every time I try and respond in ""Jeff""'s Xanga, my computer just feels the need to haul its fat technological boot and kick my ass off the internet.

It is a total conspiracy....something....something having to do with spies from Fiji or Russia or some place I've never been too...and probably linked to some environmental issue like...oh, I don't know...world peace or something.  I haven't put my finger on it just yet, but I'm sure the government is responsible, even if it's not the United States government.  Either that, or the ""Jostens"" people.  You know...the people who take school pictures and make class rings and caps and gowns and stuff?  I guess you had to be there, when we stood in line during graduation from GVSU and talked about how Jostens was a whole government run company...I mean, they do EVERYTHING!

"event","So, it's the 9th of April.  I'm Orthodox Christian and usually the calendar Orthodoxy goes by has the Passover land on a different date, which makes our Easter day fall anywhere between 1 to 4 weeks off from everyone else's Easter date.  About every I would day 4 years, we land on the same date.  This is that year!

So....

<marquee> <FONT SIZE=""5"">HAPPY GOOD FRIDAY!!!</FONT></MARQUEE>

Speaking of Good Friday, and Passover, and Easter which is one of the most important Christian holidays in existence, I saw the PASSION OF THE CHRIST a few weeks back.  Let me highlight the experience:

To sum it up, I haven't cried so much since my grandfather died in 2002.  

I seriously think that we take it for granted that the Bible says ""Jesus suffered for us"" and was ""beaten and scorged"" and that ""blood must be shed for our sins.""  The word ""crucifixtion"" is an extremely strong statement also, but again, especially in modern day humanity, what does that mean?  I think Mel Gibson does a great job illustrating what that suffering really means. It was so real!!!

I feel that my knowledge of the Bible helped a lot in understanding this movie.  I wasn't confused a bit with who was who and what was what and where was where.  (Yay for Bible competitions! Our church isn't regional and national titleholders for nothing!) Unfortunately, Mel's movie did nothing to really introduce who everyone was ( etc ), which stifled the experience for some. 

My cousin Darlene felt dissappointed because she didn't think the movie really converted anyone.  I don't think that was the point as much as renewing the Faith that is definitely overshadowed by more earthly pleasures.  She thought that since there was so much hype about the movie (and rightfully so) that since Mel had everyone's attention, he should've shown more, or done more to convert those who DON'T believe...like show before and after His death....like explaining the characters more...that sort of thing.

I agree though.  I think the beginning on Gethsemane was perfect, but like my friend Brian said in his journal, I didn't want it to end...I wanted to see what happened after He rose from the tomb! My brother in law Rami says that's the sign of a good performance...always leave the viewer wanting MORE!  Mel certainly did that, that's for sure."

and i officially accepted the asst. manager position for Deb Shop.  

it's like an end and a beginning.  and it's really sad.... and surreal.  Like I feel like I have made so many great friends with Civic, and somehow I also feel that I am still quite separate and nothing will change that (will it????) ....I've always felt that way though.  It's probably my own doing...the distancing I mean. Though I feel the closest to my circle of artist friends...hm....probably because I am an artist.  

I don't know.  It's about 2.30 am Sunday Morning.  I have white face paint in my hair.  I was mocking Houdini tonight.  ""Danny"" (who played Houdini) loved it.  I have pictures. I hope they come out.  I took about 4 pictures of my pocket, because the camera was in there.  I also have tons of video footage.  I have to make copies...one for me, ha ha, yeah right. One for ""Brian"", ""Kristi"" and ""Beth"" (that's really important.  I have to do that one soon I think).  Bri and Kristi aren't getting their's until I have time.  Hopefully, in return I can get a ragtime CD copy of the broadway cast (cough cough wink Brian)

Ah, it was so sad taking the images down from the evil Front Door Unit. :*(  I tossed them out.  They were so excellent. 

Well I should get going. I'm making myself very sad here.  Good Night. Good Morning.

I just got home.  I bought some ""crazy"" socks for our socks/suspenders day.  I went to Meijer to find suspenders but they had nothing really interesting and I thought paying 9.99 for a blah pair of suspenders was too excessive, considering I would never wear them again.  I will either have to get some from Civic's costume shop or just wear the fun fur my mom has been making instead. :)  And the suspenders were MY idea! I saw ""John F."" wearing a bright red pair for his costume, and I was jealous.  But alas, they do not sell that color in regular stores.

Last night was so fun, that I almost missed some of my cues!  Since we all don't need our headsets for cues anymore, we just talk and joke around.  ""Val"", ""Jay"", ""Jeff"" and ""I"", (ha ha, I quoted my own self. anyway).  It was fun to be able to talk on there and not have to worry about blocking the reception for the actual cues.  We talked about our theme days:  so we came up with Crazy Sock / Suspender day (tonight) and Mock Your [Favorite] Actor Day (final night, tomorrow).  So far, I'm going to be the Little Girl (played by ""Jenna"") because Jeff is going to be the Little Boy(played by ""Brian"") (who has a name, Edgar but is credited as The Little Boy. *shrugs*)  Val is going to be JP Morgan (played by ""Steve"").  Those are all the characters we have so far.  It's going to be fun, I hope.  I have my cameras ready. ;)

So I went to Deb today.  Turns out they are offering me the position at 8.00 an hour.  Jackie's opinion (my manager) is that it's a bit low given the work we have to do.  It beats 6.50 but still.  I have tomorrow to decide.  She has no say in the pay though.  <u>What do you all think?</u>

well i should get going to get ready and stuff.

It's also nearing the 1 year anniversary of my grandfather's death, which saddened me as well, especially when we called my mom to wish her Happy New Year in Michigan.

"event","<b>for some reason, I feel depressed or down....well, i think it's because Ragtime ends in a week and today was a weird day. I don't know. I want to talk to my friends but none are online... :(

Our stage manager ""Andy"" had to step in, once again, and save the day! I swear, he is so amazing!  Because one of our leads could not perform today, he substituted for him and learned lines and songs and it was simply great!  I have so much adoration for him right now.  I don't even think he knows. I want to get him something special, but don't know what.

This week I have my interview for Assistant Manager at Deb Shop.  Maybe that's what is bothering me too.  The fact that if I take this position, I won't have time for Civic Theater or any volunteering for theater!  They already told me that.  But ""Mark"" quoted something to me that if I really wanted to do it, I would make time for it...well it was more eloquent when he said it. but you get the point. ***sigh*** I'll figure it out.  See! This is what I hate about productions...the END of them and not seeing my friends from there every week. Hopefully, they will keep in touch with me as much as I keep in touch with them... :(

Now....now!  Now I remember why I love my LJ so much.  Despite the fact that no one is responding or probably reading them...but it just lets me get this crap off my chest and out there.  Like writing in a diary without the hand cramps or scribbly handwriting.

"event","So my last entry went on about how I don't like Deb Shop too much, but it's okay.  Today I got woken up, asked to come in to work which I agreed to, and worked my ass off with the district manager (who happens to be named ""Deb""...weird?) was there.  Our brand new asst. manager quit, I think I overheard.  So. As I am doing my work, Deb comes up to me and asks me about Civic Theater because she has heard I work there.  I respond.  Then she asks if Im interested in a full time job.  I said, either one full time or 2 part time is what I need right now, because I need the money.  So she asks if I am interested in asst. managing, and I knew this was coming, because Jackie (my manager) already told me about it....I told her I would be and agreed to an interview at the end of March.

Ahh, I mean it's not really what I want to do, but it couldn't hurt one bit for my resume, and I might not get the opportunity to be promoted so soon at a job.

What do you all think I should do?  Should I accept the job if offered to me after the interview???"

"event","Wow.  It has been far too long between updates.  I hardly know if anyone still reads them.  I am making this one public, too.  And it's LONG.  

<font color=""orange"">So between my senior art show, graduation, the holidays (wow! it's been a year since I have been to California!!!), finding employment and getting it, and volunteering at Civic (and all the stuff in between), I have been busy...and not busy at the same time. I will recap each event shortly. 

It feels great to write though.  As the holidays passed (Christmas, New Year and Valentine's Day), I am reminded of last year.  First off, I intend to finish to my San Jose eXperience entries (see past entries), and secondly...well there is no secondly.  Although I didn't have a valentine this year (""Marky Mark"" was mine last year - who recently celebrated a 20th birthday.  Cheers for ""Mark"" from the Peanut Gallery. yay! *dances*), but to make up for it, God made it Leap Year for me and added a 29th day to February.  I spent it at Civic Theater. </font>

<font color=""red"">Civic Theater ROCKS.  I love being there.  Actually, I'm working with some people I knew in high school (we will call them ""Betsy"" and ""Aubrey""), and was re-acquainted with a guy I performed with in Alice in Wonderland 5 years ago!  He was such a cutie, but I didn't recognize him at first and I felt really bad! Although he is attending my graduate school of choice for his undergrad.  *gasp!* My friend ""Kristi"" re-introduced us. I later told her not to ""introduce me to people I used to know"" because she and ""Kathy"" were waiting for me to stop talking with him (Apparently, 2.5 minutes is a long time to wait.  Pshaw! *wink*). Silly girls. I have met so many great people at Civic, and they are so talented and fun.  (Hi, Civic Friends!)  I would give more shout outs but I really don't know if they will be reading this at all or not. Hm....If they are...I hope they leave a RESPONSE so I know to mention them next time. 

Oh, by the way, GO SEE <B>RAGTIME</B> AT CIVIC THEATER.  IT IS AMAZING and then some!!!!!  <a href=""http://www.grct.org"" target=blank> CLICK HERE </a>FOR THE CIVIC WEBSITE! </font>

<marquee><b>Recap time:</b></marquee>

ART SHOW:
My final semester of college was so freaking hectic.  Click <a href=""http://www2.gvsu.edu/~bajaliea"" target=blank> here </a> to see my show (I even have a VIRTUAL QUICKTIME TOUR!!!).  My exhibition didn't go as well as I planned but it was still successful nonetheless.  I never, ever, ever want to go through the stress and hopelessness I felt during that show.  How stressed was I?  I lost over 5 lbs in 3 days. After the show was finally up, my body took a while to get back to normal. I was so tired, and suddenly starving.  I gained the weight back. Ha ha.  Hey, I had to eat! Anyway, it was a good exhibition.  At the end of the week, I had to DEFEND my work and my thesis statement to a committee of 6-7 professors.  That does not spell f-u-n, my friends. Not at all.  But it went well. I passed.  Yay for me. 

<font color=""blue"">GRADUATION: 
So before my senior BFA show, I had a total meltdown.  On the day I picked up my cap and gown order, I had several meetings with professors looking at my work and the meetings left me feeling like I was doing everything all wrong!!!  I was starting to feel truly stressed.  I talked to my friend ""Lisa"", and I put my cap and gown bag down without realizing it....until it was time for me to go home hours later! I was freaking OUT--searching everywhere for it.  And this is at like 9 pm - offices closed, and night classes over!  I checked in my studio and in my car and in classrooms. NOTHING.  I actually started to cry with frustration to my friend ""Robyn"" who helped me out, because I thought it was a sign! Between my crappy meetings, my feelings of helplessness and now losing my cap and gown -- I thought I was destined NEVER to Graduate!  But alas, on my way home, tears in eyes, I got a call saying the cap and gown had been found and put in my professor's office.  Phew. DEEEEEEEEEEP BREATH. 

So graduation day was great.  As we graduates, donned in our Laker Blue Caps and Gowns stood in line, we saw a Channel 8 ( or 4 or something) news anchor talking to some graduates behind us.  We, of course, think it was part of the Josten's Conspiracy.  You know Josten's.  The class ring people, the school picture people, the cap and gown people, etc.  They seriously like, run the world and no one even knows it.  It's a conspiracy, my friends.  Truly. </font>

<font color=""pink"">DEB SHOP:
I will keep this short.  It's not my favorite topic of discussion.  The irony is, I wasn't gonna even APPLY for Deb Shop but after applying to everywhere on God's Green Grand Rapids, I thought, what the heck, right? So I filled out an application.  I was rejected by Bed, Bath & Beyond probably due to lack of retail experience.  (By the way, everytime I say the name of that store, I want to get all <i>Buzz Lightyear</i> about it...bed....bath...AND BEYOND!! Okay enough of that). So I was hired mostly right before inventory.  Inventory lasted forever, and I didn't get home until 6 am.  It's an okay job, but they are pretty militant.  Retail Robots, I tell you.  I will definitely elaborate more on THAT theory!!!  Interestingly enough, Deb Shop almost kept me from doing CIVIC.  *gasp!* Looking back, thank GOD that didn't happen.  I love Civic. I don't love Deb. Deb Shop considered me for a future Asst. Manager, but in order to do that, I would not have time to do Civic.  Grr.  Well, anyway, I wasn't officially offered the position, which I'm sort of glad about, and in result, I've had a great theater experience meeting cool people. </font>

So that's it.  So far.  I have more to write.  It's almost 12 am here.  I just got back from RAGTIME an hour ago, which is early but it's Weds, and that's our early night.  

Until next time.

"event","wow. it's been SO LONG.  I am going to type here first what I put in my Degrassi Lockerpage.

<font color=""orange"">10.30.03 
**PIX COMING SOON - CHECK MY SLIDESHOW LATER** 

So it's Halloween now and I'm at work. Until 9. Then I go to my grandmother's where my sister is and hang out and play games and such. Be home in time for the midnight showing of DEGRASSI. 

But I did attend a Halloween party! It was a Halloween (slash) country line dancing clinic. So I dressed up as a hippie. nothing elaborate, mind you, as I was straight out of classes. My sister and friend came with us. We will call them ""Ang"" and ""Kay"" Kay did not want to dress up, but Ang dressed as a ""pop star."" Later we labeled ourselves Terri (me), Paige (Kay) and Ashley (Ang). But more about that later. 

We entered the Halloween HoeDown early. The first thing we did was play with a Ouija board, which I hold no stock in whatsoever. But it was fun nonetheless. This was the point where were named ourselves Degrassi people. Each of us asked a question and then waited...and waited....until finally someone would move the Ouija thing. 

Then we went to pumpkin decorating and got to choose a small punkin and paint it. I made mine Liberty. It doesn't look like Liberty at all, but it has glasses and says ""I (heart) JT"" on the back. See the pictures later for a visual. Hee hee. Ang made her's Ashley. :) 

Then LINE DANCING. Okay, so I tried it. But I'm not coordinated enough. So I quit early and went to the hemp necklace table area. It took me a long time to make what I call a ""Hemp Thing."" Not a necklace but too long to be a bracelet. It has 2 beads and it spirals. I like it, nonetheless. 

Right now I'm dressed all in pink, and have a name tag on that says ""Hi, my name is Bazooka Joe."" No one commented on my costume...oh well. 

Happy Halloween! 

Amie </font>

What is up with me?

A few words :  B....F....A......thesis SHOW!  It's so crazy.

"event","So.

My top graduate school choices off this list I found were University of Southern California, Columbia College Chicago, New York Film Academy and University of LA, which are coicidentally the BEST schools for film/arts production and probably cost more than my life.  What's an artist to do?

I keep watching television-more than usual, which isn't saying much, because I don't make a habit of watching everyday, or rather I used to not make a habit--oh whatever.  Anyway, I watch the boobtube and think, yeah I can do that!  I can produce-create sets and scenes and such.  Just this evening I was watching the Daytime Emmys (BTW-LOOOOOOVE <a href=""http://www.celebritykidz.com/shialabeouf"">SHIA LA BEOUF</a>!!! CONGRATS TO HIM!) and one category was outstanding production in arts (scenes, sets, etc) or something along those lines and I freaked out because I was like ""Yeah!!! That's my job!!! I want to be at the Daytime Emmys (or regular Emmys or Academy Awards--well you get the picture)""

It almost seems impossible to even <i>dream</i> about having such a career but why not?  Why can't I be one of those people??  They have to come from somewhere--and though it won't be easy, I have to do it.  I've always wanted to do it so what's stopping me?!?  I have to make myself stand out, and be persistent and strong and motivated and imaginative and creative. But how do I make myself stand out?  Thus far, I'm only slightly above ""pretty good.""  **SIGH**

I think it comes down to the fear of failure, which I won't know about if I don't even try! And if I don't try and take a life-altering chance, I could be living a life of regrets for not having taken a chance at all! Success stories are told all the time about stars making it big or people's dreams coming true because of their determination, and some just by pretty damn good luck.  Wish me luck and loads of prayer.  I'm gonna need it.  But! At least I know right NOW what I want to do.  I mean, I've always known, but now I know what the schools and the jobs are looking for and can gear the rest of the undergrad schooling and the things I do to cater to that knowledge.  You follow? Oh it doesnt matter.

Anyway enough ramble and bamble, its midnight, offically saturday, and I gotta go.

Okay, so I haven't updated in a bit and when I do, it's not much. Well here is more.

I've found a graduate school that I really like.  Problem is:  it's like the TOP DOG of schools.  <a href=""http://www.usc.edu""> University of Southern California</a>.  Yeah. So I could go and get a Master's of Fine Arts in Cinema and Television!  Awesome much?  But it's so darn competitive that I have to start planning--NOW!  Wish me loads of luck and all that stuff.

Other than that, my life is dull.  The weather is cold and rainy and nothing exciting is going on. Yet.  You know, when I first started this livejournal it was one year ago, before I competed in the Kentucky Regional Bible Bowl for the Orthodox Antiochian church association conference.  Now, I am doing the same thing, only it's here in Grand Rapids.  Ah, well I hope like last year, I can post of our success! *wink*

So, I should get going.  I know, another dull post but what can I say?

"event","So it's been forever since I've written to you all.  Did you miss me?

There are things on earth that are just simple little pleasures and make me amazed at God's creations.  Angie and I were headed to my cousin's graduation party but passed through a neighborhood to look at garage sales.  I was in the passenger seat so I was able to call to Angie to STOP driving when I spotted....a Mama Duck and about 6-8 baby ducklings crossing the street!!  Angie stopped (we were still in the neighborhood), and grabbed our camera and took pictures.  Suddenly, like 2 or 3 other cars were doing the same.  It was such a beautiful sight to see-goshdarnit that I didn't have my video camera!!  So Mama duck gets to the curb and hops up, and the babies try to follow but all end up bumping into to each other because they can't hop up on the curb-they're not even as tall as the curb-they're so tiny.  So after a few steps, Mama turns around and realizes-oh my babies aren't following me! And starts walking back (with the ducklings following her every move in a tiny congregation) and to side of the curb that is easier for her ducklings. So finally, she gets them all up on the sidewalk and they walk across a driveway and into someone's backyard.  It was the cutest thing and so amazing.  Those tiny ducks were so soft looking and really walked in a line behind their Mama.  Those sort of experiences make you stop and appreciate the nature around us. It really does.

So-back to more not so exciting stuff.  I graduate next December and what am I going to do with my life? I want to work in entertainment: always have.  So where do I go from there?  I've researched job opportunities (locally and nationally) and they are all looking for EXPERIENCE.  Even locally! How am I took get experience if no one is willing to give me that chance!  Volunteer work is my best bet right now.  And anyway, I want to do special effects and sets and design maquettes and mockups for things.  I don't want to do communications: which most of these jobs are.  I will have to keep working at it and eventually skoot my butt to some place like NY or LA.  Pray for me! I know it won't be easy.  Part of me wants to take that chance and go for it and work hard, but I realize now, I'm afraid of failing....but how will I ever know if I don't take that chance????

Studying!  I'm studying for the Antiochian Orthodox Conference Bible Bowl!!!  Galatians, Ephesians and Phillipians is NOT easy.  I'm on the adult team-our Teen Team is great but right now, me and my partner aren't so strong. Got to fix that!

Okay, that is my update for now.  I want to go to the movies and see Holes, Lizzie McGuire, and of course XMen2

peace out,

Angie 'graduated' on April 26! I am very proud of her.  I'm also glad we aren't doing that in the same semester. That would've been a nightmare!  We would have been at separate ends of the Van Andel arena which would have sucked for my family!  Anyway, it was good ceremony.  I saw loads of my friends walking! Congrats to the class of 2003.

"event","so last night, GVSU had the annual RECOGNITION AWARDS for the student life organizations on campus.  Our organization kicked ass this year.  We won Outstanding Cultural Program (for bringing in Dr. James Zogby-international speaker and founder of Arab American Insititute in Washington),  Outstanding Advisor (we nominated him and he deserved it!) and then...THEN!  There was a new award, one we did not nominate ourselves for.  It was the Heath L. Sabin Student Life Fund Award.  (Named after the Head of Appropriations-the student senator you go to for organization funds-Heath Sabin).  It was awarded to a dedicated organization who was prompt with deadlines, budget, used the money towards activities and events they said they would, as well as putting on successful, school enhancing events (etc etc).  Heath stood at the podium describing the award then describing the recipient.  I <i>knew</i> he was describing us so it came as no surprise, but more of a thrill and pleasure to hear that he announced Arab Culture Club the winner.  I went up and recieved the award on behalf of ACC.  Now you have to understand that ALL ORGANIZATIONS GO THROUGH HEATH/STUDENT SENATE.  There are over 50 to say the least, organizations, and WE WERE CHOSEN FOR THIS AWARD!  We will have our name on a floating trophy and we recieved a beautiful plexiglass trophy to keep.  It was awesome.  

Individual awards: well i got a ""graduating senior"" recognition award, among many others.  That included an award certificate, a photo album and GVSU ALUMNI mug. Yes.. goodies!

Angie got this too. but was also awarded one of those surprise awards.  She was chosen to recieve the ""Advisor's Award"" by the head of Cultural Board for someone who stood out, worked hard with her organization as well as Cultural Board, was active, friendly, a true leader (etc etc).  Again, there are hundreds of students that could have been chosen (if there are 50 + organizations, and tons of leaders, you do the math) and MY SISTER WAS AWARDED. She deserved it, goshdarnit.  But that's how it always is.  She got an award like that last year for her leadership and service and was nominated by ACC for the President's Award and won.  And another one before the Advisor's Award called the Thomas Sekora Award.  She has become one of those award-winners because of her natural leadership and responsibility and drive!  I'm proud of her.  She really stands out. 

I'm not bragging...well not in a mean way.  It was just an exciting night last night. 

And just now-I realized, for this time capsule project I am making, that I can use PVC PIPE!  It's waterproof and durable! Of course!  I went all over looking for the right thing and researching things I could waterproof my metal container with.  THEN-I read online about people using PVC Pipe!  *LIGHT BULB flickers* DUH! Why had I forgotten it?  So Im excited now.  Yay. Anyway I got to get back to work.  Talk to you all later

Then I went into class, and though I was sooo tired and sipped on my bitter coffee laced with floaty grains of coffee, I was feeling better.  I got my paper back and got an A and only ONE ITTY BITTY part was marked. Score again!

Then after class, (half the time was spent watching a documentary), I went to go meet angie in Kirkhof and realized Harry Potter was playing, though I had missed an hour of it.  Score again! I sat down, Angie later to follow, and watched an hour of the movie before my 4:30 class.  Score times 10! It was so great to watch it, and just chill out. So my day got better.

had weird encounters with people dressed in chicken suits-ask if you dare.

seen more then a modest share of my sister in the media and getting honorable recognition in several ways. good for her. i pale in comparison.

the weather is improving. we can thank the Heavenly Weatherman for that. 

Next week, if i have time, I will watch Harry Potter. It is also Student Employee Appreciation week--goodtimes hopefully.

Have class. Must Go. Write back.

"event","I don't know whether this has to do with my consistent requests in the Suggestion Box at the Information Desk at school but an organization at GVSU is finally playing  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets!  Angie told me to  <a href=""http://events.gvsu.edu/ViewCalendar.asp?inDate=4%2F7%2F2003""> check 2 weeks from now on the GVSUEvents </a>.

Guess who is going to be watching that movie all week?  PLUS it's Student Employee Appreciation week. That, too, includes your's truly. Just a bit of nice news.

peace love and ron.

"event","Everything else in my life seems so trivial at this point.

I got an email from someone at my school, it was a mss email. it said that even though we may or may not agree with the war, there is nothing we can do about it now, but pray that it ends quickly and the soliders return safely.

I agree. My cousin Danny is a captain in the army. I am so worried for everyone.  

Please, send prayers and good thoughts to the way of all the US troops, and the innocent civilians.  I saw on the news iraui children, maybe 3 or 4 years old, in hospitals. it brings tears to your eyes."

"event","So ""Rami"" took Angie and Me to go eat at this Mexican place to wait for Tanya.  I am full of Mexican food so much, I can't breathe.

*Sigh*  So how is everyone? just a general ""hello, how are ya"" to you all. I am waiting until Rami and Tanya's friends come over and chill. They are not here yet and until they are, here i am-typin' away. It's like a quick phone call or something.

Hm Anyway, boring post, I'll admit. :)

TTYL
God bless,

"event","Palestinian / Isreali conflict.

How sad that Palestinians don't even have gas masks to save or aid in the survival of their citizens.  They are dying, and no one seems to care, at all.  I can't even type anymore than this because it makes my blood boil to do so.

On a lighter note:

I am in Detroit (Canton) now, and was visiting Tanya at CVS.  I found in the discount basket this product:

<b>Firmorol - 10</b> Fanny Firming Lotion
The image on the cover was a nicely shaped 'fanny' in white cotton undies-the same ones used for underwear ads. Hm. I thought it was funny.

That is all for now, my friends.

Peace in the middle east

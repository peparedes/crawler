Amsterdam is the coolest place ever they have escelator type things on flat surfaces and u just hop on and it basically walks for you.  Scotland is awesome too its so beautiful today we walked on the west rocks (the coastal cliffs) and then we went to a pub and played pool and stuff scottish pool has different rules so it was weird, its so hard to understand what the scottish guys are saying when they are drunk cuz there accents get so thick i had to ask people to repeat what they said like 3 times for me to understand it. ill try and update as much as possible.

your eyes are cold
the frost melts and runs down your cheeks a bit to often
for no reason at all
over dramatic ways sidetracking your life
use this as your letter home
tell all of your friends about how you broke this young boys heart
tell everyone about how good it made you feel

"event","Well lets see had my physical today it wasnt bad.

When did i become second rate to you
when did you only talk to me when you needed something
when did the words best friends loose their meanings
what happened to best friends forever

Leaving me must be easy
seeing that you come and go with no regrets
remeber the words we'll never let these moments go

your lack of conversation is showing our demise
your presence is missing in this empty hole
your slowly fading away


whatever it sucks but whatever

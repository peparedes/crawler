"event","life is starting to look better now... i finally learned the true meaning of love and friendship and the true meaning of a relationship... as a few of you know i said i was having the WORST day ever... but as a good friend rj said... since this is the worst day ever the days after that have to be better... and it is... last night was life changing... i realized how much in love i was and how lost i would be with out tim... i stopped hiding and told any secret i've ever had... i can FINALLY with out hesitation say i am over matt... i didnt think i could but i finally did it and it feels so good to say it now and know i mean it... i can finally love tim whole heartedly and know that i am not hiding anything... its so funny... a year ago didnt expect us to make it and we did and i'm <u>beyond</u>overjoyed that it did because with out tim i dont want to know where i'd be... probably a drunk whore still popping pills... neither of which i am any more... i havent gotten drunk since last christmas eve, i havent popped a pill in a few years and i actually threw my bottle of hydro away upon meeting tim and didnt think twice about it... i found GOD and plan on having a personal relationship with Him to fill the void thats missing... *starting to get a bit choked up here*... for the first time in my life i knew that if i walked away i'd be making the biggest mistake of my life and i didnt want that to happen... i wouldnt be able to live with that... i begged and pleaded that if God could save my relationship i'd do the right thing and now i have to live up to my half of the bargin... so it was kinda funny when i heard this song it summed everything up into a few little minutes... i posted the lyrics because they are so true... so yea

"event","last nite... i talked to shante, mike's new girlfriend. and she's really not that bad of a girl... infact, we're pretty similar believe it or not. there was no animosity between us... we talked on the phone from like 130ish to about 3 in the damn morning haha. but she's pretty cool. We both have the same opinions on everything and all so its all good. anyway... i think its funny... we didnt talk any trash to eachother, seeing as i am the ex girlfriend and she is the current. we talked openly about our relationships with him and how they are kinda the same, but different. but thats with anyone... so all in all i gained a new friend and i'm cool with the fact that shes with him, besides i have matt, where can i go wrong with him?!

so anyway while we are on the subject of  yesterday, work was AMAAZING! i am so glad that everything went smoothly and nothing bad happened. its like last year, everything that could have happened, did... this year it was perfect! and i get to think about stuff for kids fest lmao yesssss! more stress, but i'm lovin it!"

You're less religious, traditional, and uptight than most Democrats.

Smoking pot, homosexuality, and gambling are all okay in your book.

"event","yeah its official... i'm like a workaholic. i just did 7 days straight of work and i'm raring for more work, so i volunteered to do a double.  meaning i worked today from 8a-12p and go back in at like 4ish.... so yeah. i wont be gettin off until 11 if i'm lucky. But anyway. lets start back from my last update... i have my surgery scheduled for monday, aug 8th at the orthopedic cencter instead of the baptist med center (yay!) so that means i'll be comin home after the surgery so if yall wanna visit let me know, i'll be home, WHERE THE HELL ELSE CAN I GO?! but yeah. So now i'm starting to get nervous. not because of the actual surgery but the healin part. i hate pain. i was thinking last nite if i should just cancel it. but i wont. i need this and thats what i keep tellin myself. but anyway. 

WEDNESDAY was the jaime's bday. i had to work 3-1030. work was the day from hell! but i survived. So then after work i change clothes, put gas in the car and go. Well i get to nates house and due to bad planning, it was just me and nathan until shoni and jaime showed up and then joe and then vanessa and her twisted humor, and then chris and candace. But instead of going to denny's we ate taco bell at nates house. so at around 1ish i left and went to wally world to buy some stuff and then i went back to taco bell and then i went home.

THURSDAY i wasnt expecting to work but i did. i went in 2-8 because due to God answering another prayer bryan quit!!!!! you guys have like no clue how happy i am! So with him quitting, it made it so much easier to get extra hours. So i got 6 extra hours. Then Latiesha asked me to work for her today from 8-12 so i did and i didnt complain! so that put me at like 40 hours (fyi i'm still part time so we call that time and a fuckin half) and so then thats when laura asked me to work bryans shift. hell fuckin yes! So now i'm lookin at havin a FAT ASS MUTHA FUCKIN PAYCHECK next week while i'm gone. that should really hold me over while i'm not there. When i got home i chilled out for a bit and then thats when jeanie calls and she comes over with Portia and my new boyfriends Gage and Richie (*they are like lil kids guys*) and um we hung out and then heather came over so we all had the idea to go to publix and totally kill daniel's truck. if i had a pictured i'd upload it but our dumbasses forgot the camera. lmao. so yeah. then we get our asses up to publix, buy shaving cream, silly string, syran wrap, toilet paper and just let loose on his truck. lmao. we had a blast. he was pissed.the funny thing is we went through his line to buy all the shit! so we cleaned his truck in our bikinis at 11 oclock at nite. lmao. yeah that was great. So then afterwards we go to taco bell (me, daniel, jeanie, and jason) and get mom and tee some food. So then we just like had so much fuckin fun while we were in the drive thru. I took my shorts off that had my bikini bottems under neath and threw them at daniel who holds them out of the window and waves them around. Jeanie's pants ended up on the hood of the car. it was nuts. the bitch behind us was probably pissed cuz we were rockin the car! lmao. hahahahahha innuendo indeed that nite.

FRIDAY i mean today... i was supposed to go to Heather's house to hang out with Mrs Holly and Stephan and go to the mall with stephan of whom i'm on the phone wit now, but since i'm workin all day i will just go get something to eat with him while i'm on break. thats cool i think that shall work out for the good today. (*breaks into song* WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE... WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIIIIIIS???? WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE... WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE THIIIIIIS????? (HEY HEY HEY)*) okay sorry... i'm really diggin this song right now. lmao. anyway. but  yeah. So now i'm gonna take a nap. and hopefully wake up in time to make it to work. oh yeah before i forget....

my car is ""totalled"". the cost of the rental car + the cost of the parts + the cost of labor= more than the amount my car is worth lmao. what the hell. so now i have a totalled car and i have to basically look for a new one... GOOD GOING CHRISTY STRUBBS! aka the bitch who hit me!"

"event","last nite at work we waxed the floors. so that included a trip to dunkin donuts to get 3 large lattes for me , mrs vikki and christy. we were sooo freakin hyper! i drank all of mine in less than ten minutes. so after basically running around the store singin songs and all, it was time to wax. we got out of there at basically 115-130... either or... i was in such a good mood. i had a crappy day earlier for diff reasons but i will update on that later. so when i get home. i checked in with dad to let him know i'm home and made the living room my own sanctuary. i played cards with myself, read a book, colored, wrote a blues/metal song that is caused purely by caffine and lack of sleep. so i wrote probably 5 or so pages on random things.. drew a picture... stuff like that. watched movies, cartoons and stuff like that... by then it was 4 in the morning so i had a frappachino... thats when the real fire works happened. i was jumping on everything... singing the dumbest songs (*dont worry be happy*) and just totally losing my mind. i went pee like 8 times. took a crap and then realized that the greener it is the fresher it is. I AM A GENIOUS! lol and yeah... i ate some noodles... drank some water... i did the most retarded things in human nature and totally wished that i could hang out with Bam Margera cuz he's cool... yup... i am a one woman show... but the good news is i got four hours of sleep and had two more mountain dews at work! WOOOHOOO!

ps me and tiebe arent really talking right now... sorry

oh yeah i met a guy named matt (*go figure*) he seems relatively cool but i wont let it go further than a friendship.... i fuckin  swear! lmao. okay bye

I HATE IT! its one of my biggest fears. so first it starts out with me having to pick mom up from work... she works downtown. so that involves me getting on the highway and driving... in the rain. so after my car is almost sandwiched between two hydroplaning cars, ran off the road by some asshole who must have been late to his male gyno office...i pulled over and said FUCK YOU!"

"event","a week later as the rain falls down i feel as if i ripped my own damn heart out. i cant understand why i did it. i just did it. i was thinking today while i was watching this stupid ass britney spears movie how much i freakin miss him. i miss being hugged, held, kissed and all that. its like wow... i really liked him and i dumped him for matt who i wont see for another few months. HOW FUCKIN STUPID AM I?!?!?!?! i'm really beatin myself up for this one and i wouldnt be suprised if he didnt want to have anything to do with me. there are times where its like i thought i seen him but i didnt. i feel so stupid and so just UGH! what the hell is my problem? all that shit that me and matt went through i should have said thats it. i am over it. but no i kept holding on. i fuckin gave his ass advice on how to stay with brittany bell when i loved his ass and it hurt like hell and he knows that. its amazing how love makes you do the dumbest things. he found two rings he likes and thats fine. marriage is okay. but i'm only 18. i wanna get my feet wet in the water ya know. i love him to death and yall know that. We talk about everything. How our life will be when we have kids and our dog Screwfus... i think everyday maybe i made a mistake. maybe i shouldnt have broken up with mike. maybe i should have just said fuck you to matt... but i couldnt. guys we have been together almost since 9th grade.... come on. could you do it??? i joke around and laugh on the surface but on the inside i'm cryin. this blows."

"event","today was probably the first happy day i had in a while. i drove... listened to some music.... and just chilled really. i cant remember the last time i could just chill and not have to worry about anything in particular. the job is okay... the family is okay... the only thing that still is on my mind is the breakup but i'm dealing. its not easy. i learned alot about myself on the way back from fleming island. what it is... i dont know. but still... i learned something. i talked to iraisa last nite. she is doing good. she told me to tell everyone HI! and SHE MISSES  YALL and THE BABY IS DOING FINE! but anyway. things on the home front are good. me and my dad are getting along a little more better and thats always a good thing. probably because he knows that my nerves as of recently are bad and worse now so he just blows up once a week as apposed to three or more. HEY PUBLIX BREAKFAST CLUB! BREAKFAST NEXT THURSDAY AT SHONEYS OR DENNYS... YALL PICK I'M HUNGRY!  so thats my update. time to face the music and go to work... on a friday. dammit."

"event","since i last posted i needed some time to myself. i took the time to think about what went on and what i did... i came to the conclusion that as much as it hurt i needed to do it. i'm still adjusting though. i needed help getting through it and thats where my wonderful friends and driving and music came in. i had to get my mind off of it so i overloaded myself with work and drives to Orange Park. Although its done and over with i still think about it and find myself crying over it saying my what ifs and shoulda coulda wouldas... i hope that he can find it to be friends with me. i still like him i really do i just wish that it never had to happen. i blame myself for not being honest at that exact moment but i was so caught up that i couldnt do it. there was never a right time. i had so much fun with him that i was starting to feel wanted and needed. thats really a good feeling. and with not seeing matt for over a year that was what i needed and i really did like mike i really did and you all know that! i'm starting to think i made a mistake and i hate that feeling. Even though i am anticipating seeing Matt again in January or February, i wish i could see mike today. no screw that i want to see mike today and just be in his arms again and hug and kiss again like we used to. okay well... thats my up date... wait no it isnt

i had my interview today at jc penneys i do hope it goes good because i need to get out of publix. i really do. okay bye."

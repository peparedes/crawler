"event","There are two council members that are in charge of making sure no one from the Night Class eats the Day class, one night class member, and one day class member. (It is very much like Vampire Knights) Most importantly though, it gives some basis for friction and interaction between the characters. The only real 'job' that comes with that position is that the student is now in charge of making sure no one is where they shouldn't be during the switch over from day to night. They also will most likely be presented with minor problems from the other students and are expected to solve them as well as they can before passing them up to administration.

Posted everywhere on campus is a paper advertising the opening of the day class council position. For now the only Night class character, Rafia, will serve as the council member for the Night class. If there is a sudden influx of night class character though, she'll 'get lazy' and step down hosting another election for the position. To get elected as a council member all you really have to do is 'sign up' by commenting here, and the rest depends on the number of people interested."

"event","This is merely the rp rules not the Roth Academy rules. For those, view the community profile under 'To the Students'

1. Godmodding or metagaming is forbidden and considered worthy of suspension. This means that unless they give you explicit permission, you can't control someone else's character, and if you're going to do something that directly affects a character other than your own, please ask the character in question first. Also, do remember that nobody is invincible, all right?

2. Be polite about disagreements you may have with other players; try to work it out with them privately but don't cause a huge ruckus.

3. Please try to stay active! Of course, we certainly hope you have other interests outside of school, but we'd still like it if you could find time to update your journals at least once or twice a week so that we know what you're up to. 

4. Four characters per player for the time being. You can have less than four, of course, if you so desire, but no more. Existing members may eventually be granted additional characters beyond the limit on a case-by-case basis.

5. NC-17 materal, whether it's explicitly sexual or explicitly violent, is permitted but must be accompanied by a warning. And ALL logs must be under an lj-cut to avoid stretching the flist.

6. This RPG is obviously going to include yuri/femmeslash/shoujo-ai. If that's not your thing, well... I don't know if this is really the RPG for you.

7. In order to allow all players an opportunity to play characters from a series, please do not apply for more than two characters from the same fandom. It is good to share, after all. 

8. HAVE FUN!

ps. I think I borrowed these rules from another rp, so if you see something clever in them, it's not me&nbsp; ^.^"

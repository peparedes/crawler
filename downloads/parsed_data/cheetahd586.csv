"event","Wow, I need to learn to write better titles. As I sit here again telling myself that I need to learn to update this often, I am jumping for joy inside. I just laid my first real paid voice acting role! I will be playing Tarun a british, teenage tiger full of angst I am SO EXCITED!!!! Tripod sucks, I can't even log in to it and it times out, oh well thus is the life of someone to cheap to buy webspace. School has been going great, and I am loving senior year. I am having a blast being a choir aide in Men's choir, but am a little nervous about having to play the piano for them. Oh well, I like a challenge. Oh well, another short update for me, back to watching Nick GAS!"

"event","Well the countdown to Hell week for ""Anything Goes"" is officially at 5 days. For those who don't know I play the snooty britishman Sir Evelyn Oakliegh in Onalaska High School's production. Things are going well, but again, hell week is really going to test my committment and endurance. On the voice acting scene, I landed a role in Stray's Castlevania RP, which I am really excited about doing. I thought I landed a paying gig, but the guy just seems shady, so I don't think it is really what he says it is. Summer is going by SOOOO quickly I can't even stand it. In a week or so I am going to a vocal jazz camp, a few weeks after that is going to be 12 hours a day of show choir camp (which I can't wait for) and then me and my family are going on a cruise to MEXICO!!!!! Yeah, if I think of anything else, well I guess I may update more considering it's summer, but don't quote me on that.

"event","WEll again, completely forgot to update this. Amyway, the Odd Couple is this week, and I am so excited. We have an amazing cast, and we are going to rock the house. I just made a new AVA resume website (http://avacheetahd586.tripod.com/) and am glad, because groupnetwork was starting to tick me off. I am really excited, I just signed up for my ACT & SAT over the weekend, and those are coming up quick. Showchoir got 2nd at Urbandale, which sucked, WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR ANKENY!!!!!!!!! Next up, Cedar Rapids, which should be a great competition because we are taking on LaCrosse Central (who are just bouncing back from a 4th place finish) who are our biggest rival. Anyway, thats my random rant for the day... or week. See ya later!

"event","Anyway hello again (like anyone reads this) I am up at 10:26 pm writing this for no particular reason whatsoever. I just won $25 in a poker game today, so that was pretty cool, I played like crap though. Anyway, going to urbandale this weekend is going to be fun for show choir, I just hope that we can stay close to Ankeny, they are amazing this year. My voice acting is going well, I just wish I had more time to do it, but school is a necissary evil I guess. I had better go to bed, I have a lot of rehersal for show choir tomorrow, and I need sleep."

I have been sick for at least 4 or 5 freakin days now, and its starting to get old... really old. Showchoir is going well, we have to get ready for Urbandale next weekend, I really want to win another after tasting victory at Sauk Prairie.

"event","No reason for the title except that I am watching Iron Chef America on Food Network. Today was an interesting start to the new year. My sister threatened to stab me with a fork for blowing out some cadles, but other than that, it's going to be an awesome year. I have show choir tomorrow from 1-6, which i am really looking forward to. I got a bunch of auditions in for the VAA today, which was awesome, I always have fun doing that. I am excited that a choir from Luther College is coming to my church tomorrow. I really have run out of ideas, so this is it for today. Stay safe everyone!

"event","Gotta love the time when we put away all the Christmas decorations, anyway this is basically my first ""real"" post where I can just rant about stuff that has no relation to each other. First of all, happy new year to everyone out there reading this. I really don't want break to be over, especially because that severly limits my time to do voice acting. The only thing good about going back to school is showchoir. The Onalaska Hilltopper show choir, for those of you who don't know, is one of the top show choirs in the nation. I have a blast in it, even though watching everyone else dance and such kinda depresses me, I was definitely accepted for my singing, and not my dancing. Well, thats about all I have time for today, have to do some heavy lifting of Christmas boxes!
Peace out!

Your Stress Sources
Sensitive and impressionable, prone to absorbing enthusiasms. Seeks an idealized--but so far unfulfilled--situation in which he can share with another a complete accord and mutual depth of understanding. Feels there is a risk of being exploited if he is too ready to trust others and therefore demands proof of their sincerity. Needs to know exactly where he stands in relationships.


Your Restrained Characteristics
Willing to become emotionally involved, but demanding and particular in his choice of a partner and in his relations with those close to him. Needs reassurance and is careful to avoid open conflict since this might reduce his prospects of realizing his hopes.
Circumstances force him to compromise and to forgo some pleasures for the time being. Capable of achieving physical satisfaction from sexual activity.




Your Desired Objective
Wants to make a favorable impression and be recognized. Needs to feel appreciated and admired. Sensitive and easily hurt if no notice is taken of him or if he is not given adequate acknowledgment.


Your Actual Problem
Works to strengthen his position and bolster his self-esteem by examining his own accomplishments (and those of others) with critical appraisal and scientific discrimination. Insists on having things clear-cut and unequivocal.


Your Actual Problem #2
Strongly resists outside influence and any interference with his freedom to make his own decisions and plans. Works to establish and strengthen his own position.


Yeah, its 1:17 in the morning, and Im exhausted. So Im going to bed and there's nothing you can do about it! GO NORTHERN ILLINOIS HUSKIES!!!!!"

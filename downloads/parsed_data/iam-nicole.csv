"event","You know what I realized today.

Well driving around I saw all these buses and it reminded me of taking them in seattle.  Let just say our transportation system sucks.

Well I was driving I noticed the bus stop and the only thing at the bus stops was the number bus that picked up at that stop. It didn't say where it was going or what time the pick ups where at.
  So lets say if you were new in town you would have to go online and see the schedule or ask the bus driver. Lame!!!

Where as in seattle it says each bus number that picks up plus exactly each destination the bus was going along with what time it came . And to top it off each bus driver was supper friendly and would help in telling you which bus number to go on if you were lost.

I did a lot of research and I could never find anything about needing a license to do hair.

She continued and told me that there are schools there that you can go to but if you want to work in a salon in england all you do is apprentice at the salon and then they give you a chair.

I'm going to more research but moving there to do hair just made it a whole lot easier.

Anyways I have come to realize  in the time spent without a computer and barely a television that we are merly ants upon an ant hill, son..  Get your ass outside and explore. Don't get me wrong I would love to listen to new music on this thing called the internet but sometimes you have to go without to realize what your missing out, well love, I have.. stop and look around you life goes on and you see in one moment flowers blooming and then the next leaves are falling. Get your ass outside. Stop looking at your myspace or face book or blogspot to see who added you or who added new pictures. I myself am not a nature person but tell me how watching as much tv in a day as you did work and spending as much time on the computer is worth your time. I get it youre tired, you want to relax sprawled out across the couch in your undies watching reruns of friends. Get over it! I love friends and can watch it time and time again don't get me wrong but when did life stop and getting sucked into the television begin. This is me signing out for the most part merly to sign in to see what shows are coming up. I'm over this .  use with moderation because it can take over and sooner or later its all you have left while the world moved on without you. Remember there is a lot to see. A lot to be learned. A lot to gain, you just have to go out there and find it. Signing out xo nicole

"event","So this past week has been just plain aweful, if I had a better word I would use it. I haven't told anyone but one person about what I'm going through. I thiink I finally broke down and just cried so hard for the first time yesterday. For me crying in my opinion is viewed as a weakness and in my m.ind I am definitely not a weak person.  Iam also very much not an open person about my life or anything as a fact so more then likely this will get deleted.

I've been asked why I don't trust people and why I don't open up well this is why

Yesterday I was told that someone  told someone ,very important to me, that they would've helped me about a situation I've been in.  

Which was an absolute and complete lie. And I had nothing to say to defend myself. I didn't even tell that person it was untrue. Why? I just was completely quite.  this person who is telling lies about me has been doing this for a while now and I can't even call this person out on it, I've caught this person in many .and everytime I face this person I just want to ignore them and walk away and yet I actually treat them like a human being. Stupid. 

And the funny thing is how can this person walk up to me and pretend to be a friend and try to get on my good side. Haha this is why."

He was walking around and then he puts his soda on the bench walks up to me and says have you seen my soda. I really wanted to laugh but I smiled and said that one. Then he asked for a pair of shoes and I measured his foot and it said 2.5 and I said I would bring a 2.5 out and then he said also a 2 because he was very assure that he shoe size was a two.then when I bring out the shoes and bring them over to him he was throwing his hands in the air and wiggling. Then he looks at me and says I was just practicing my dance moves. Hahaah that has been probably one of the funniest customers in a long time!!

I almost have my own chair just maybe one to two more months than I'm on my own,crazy it just happens so fast. Did my first photoshoot the other week, it went really well once I get them back ill try and put them up so everyone can see. There's so much in the future. It seems like all the work, which a lot of the times it feels like it easy, is really just begining. is it weird that before anything my work comes first, I absolutley would drop anything if my bosses wanted me to do something.

"event","I just noticed that some of the students in last years class friended me. I went through a few of the student's journals, Justin's and Simi's so far, and I have to say it was very helpful and very informing. I learned much different information than what tax wise and our ""Bibles"" teach us. All the later entries talked about different experiences and different problems they came across while filing returns. I would definitely recommend reading through the entries for at least that purpose, preparing yourself for problems that might arise and then learning about how to deal with them.
On another note, I liked reading the journal entries because it just reaffirmed some of what I was already thinking would happen when filing season starts- there would be amazing lows and highs. I read both uplifting stories of families receiving greater refunds than previous years, but also of people realizing they wouldn't be getting refunds that they were expecting. I read a compelling story of a man who had to file ""Married Filing Separately"" which we all know means a very small refund. The man left in despair, hoping he could go somewhere else to find the refund he was looking for. My heart sank reading the story, and I know that when situations like this one actually happen in person, it will sink again. There will be so many times when we feel sad, but at the same time, we will able to always feel proud of the work we are doing to help others. I think an experience like the one we are about to have is going to leave a lasting impression on us for a lifetime."

"event","Does anyone know where we get more flyers? Tomorrow I wanted to go to the office of the Big Brother / Big Sister program and see if I could leave flyers there that parents would see when dropping kids off. A few of my friends participate in this program, but I didn't know if it would be appropriate to give flyers to these children to bring home to their parents. I thought it would probably be better to keep the little ones out of it."

A very interesting article. Discusses the issue of the unfair taxing that takes place in Switzerland for the rich. For me, the article made me almost angry to think that millionaires and billionaires want their money to be taxed as little as possible, when there are people like the one's we will meet at the Kenney center."

"event","One idea I had for marketing, and probably especially useful for seniors is to put flyers on your neighbor's cars. It would be a great way to reach some of the people that definitely would probably benefit from our help. I'll post again when I think of more ideas..."

"event","Bio:

My name is Lauren Eilberg and I am a Senior, an Economics and Sociology minor. I am from Needham , Ma. I was abroad this past fall on a central Europe program. I traveled to Germany, Romania and Hungary through the trip. It was really amazing to see the huge differences between Western Europe, central Europe, and Eastern Europe. As for job plans, I really don't know and I'm not too worried about it. I still don't know what I want to do and I don't plan on rushing into anything. I am about to start my thesis this winter, and still don't know the topic! Any suggestions? Just kidding."

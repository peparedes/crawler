i have one thing to be proud of. one. that's it. nothing i do is worthwhile, and nothing i do is benefitial. i'm nothing more than average..

if i'm the world to someone, why do i feel empty? i feel like i have no meaning in life, no direction...i feel...lost."

"event","so...i dont know. im feeling really...weird. like not myself. i feel so far away from everyone, and i feel like im losing touch with who's important to me. i...i dont know what to say or do anymore. nothing i do is ever good enough, and i get ridiculed for it, from my friends, family, and even total strangers. i dont know what to do. 

i want to live again, thats what i want. i want the ability to go back and choose again. i want my decisions to be based on experience, not what's easiest. im a bigger loser than everyone may think. i havent talked to my friends in forever, i havent talked to my family in forever. i havent done anything important or useful lately...im just a big loser. simple as that. i want to go back and change it all...but seeing as that's not possible, i dont know what to do. i wasted so much, and iv become so little. im sorry world, iv let you down.

i dont even know what to type now. if you guys read this still, even after my lack of updates and junk, im sorry. im sorry that im so sad all the time, im sorry that i havent talked to any of you in forever. iv realized that iv pushed everyone away, and tahts not what i need. but...something tells me that i wont change. iv tried that, and i cant do it. im a loser, nothing can change it. im sorry to...lets see...morgan, cuz i havent been the friend i need to be for you. you were like..the best ever and i havent made any attempt to contact you at all. sorry to...jazzy, for almost everything. im fading from you, and your friendship is something i value, but, like normal, i fucked it up. im sorry to...joe, because...well, i havent been a good friend. i really havent. sorry to lil miss jen, who has been nothing less than a perfect friend to me...im sorry that i didnt embrace it more and see the usefulness in it. bryce, sorry i didnt take ear to your advice on things, and sorry that i havent kept in touch. sorry to cressa actually...you're a fun kid and i havent done anything to even begin to get to know you as the person you are. i just made assumptions and kept my distance, and nobody deserves that. to richelle, you were always so supportive of me and such a good friend, sorry... sorry to everyone that i forgot, but im still not done.

sorry to anna. anna, you'v been nothing less than what i need in a friend, but i fucked that up too. im sorry i havent been there for you, im not even sure of whats going on in your life. i see all these journals involving other people and things of the like, but havent seen anything from you in awhile. im sorry that i made you be there for me, then hung out in the back of the room while you suffer. you deserve better.

especially sorry to melissa. you're my joy, and i feel like iv ruined it. every time you talk, i listen, i really do. i enjoy hearing about your life, your little suprises, you in general. but i still feel like i screwed that up somehow. you wouldnt feel the way you do if i were a good boyfriend. i really miss you, and i really wish you'd call or something.

im an idiot, if anyone made it to the bottom of my stupid post, dont comment on it saying that ""oh itll be ok, everything's ok"" because its not. its not ok to neglect those close to you, and thats exactly what iv done. i miss every one of you guys and i really hope you'll forgive me, but the truth is that i dont deserve it. i deserve just what i gave you: neglect. i deserve no more, and for this im sorry."

lately, iv been feeling like i lost something. feeling like something's missing. like...im not whole anymore. its really weird, and my dad breathing down my back at work and at home doesnt help, neither does anna threatening to end our friendship every chance she gets, neither does...well, a lot of things. i just feel...empty. i dont feel like talking to anyone for the first time in..well, a long time. i feel like i did, there's no mistaking it. 

<i>but if im so miserable, why am i still taking it?</i>

...whatever. im leaving soon anyway. i really hope that someone's going to miss me, i dont really care who. for right now, i feel like no one will, and no one does.

i think that im going to start another lj, and not tell anyone about it, and just write EXACTLY what im thinking and feeling, because im hoping that will help. maybe not, but maybe. its like having someone...well something...there to talk to, and it has to listen, because i made it.

im either a giant asshole or a really nice kid. i think i demonstrated both in the last 2 days, but i cant really tell for the nice one. you'd think that eventually karma'd catch up with me and reward me for something. or kick my ass. prolly the second one, but that doesnt matter. it just seems that my only marketable skill is to occupy space.

with that, im going to go try to convince my parents that i need to go out driving, cuz im probably going to sit at home for the 4th, just like pretty much every other day. so independence day is like every other day.

"event","im in a weird mood...like a ""spill what you're feeling"" mood...so here goes...

i am TIRED of putting a lot into something and getting next to nothing back. its been my way of life, and it tears me up. really.

im tired of the lying, im tired of the sneaking, im tired of abandon-ness, im tired of AOL, im tired of...well, just about everything.

no matter what you all may think, i pour my heart and soul into everything that i do that i care about. i try soo hard, and i put sooo much energy into it. it may mean sacrificing a lot of stuff, but somehow i feel it'll be worth it.

...lately it hasnt...

example: work. i have worked at alpine way for 2 years, 2 months, and 26 days. wednesday is my last day. i worked hard just about every day for that time, and what do i get out of it now? a final paycheck and a kick out the door. people ask me if im really leaving, and i tell them yes...so they just say ""hmm"" and walk away. no ""why"" or ""ill miss you's""...just hmm's. i thought that people noticed that i work hard everyday, but i guess not. 

i guess whatever. im so used to working hard and getting ABSOLUTELY nothing in return, but im tired of it. i put soo much time in, and i never get anything out of it. im not just typing about work, im typing about a lot of stuff in general. i honestly pour my heart, my sweat, my tears, my dreams, my hopes, my soul essentially, into so much just to be crushed in the end. and im tired of it.

no more pushing me around. im gonna do what i want, when i want. some of you may notice a change, but thats only because im underappreciated. i dont mean to toot my own horn, but i work hard, and im tired of being the only one.

ah fuck it, im leaving soon anyway, right?

...i just dont know what to do. i do so much and get so little, its...almost embarrasing. it hurts...so much. it makes me feel like...lets see if i can describe this even close to how it feels. 

it feels...like i work hard to make things good, but the things i work hard for tear me open, bleed me completely dry of everything i have inside me, sew me up with thrift store bought thread and a needle they found lying outside their house, decide that's not enough, so they punch a hole in my chest in an attempt to tear out my empty heart, but miss...a few times, so they keep punching til they find it, then it's thrown on the ground, stomped on a few times, then spit on, while i watch and try to cry, but i can't because ive been bled dry of tears already.

i think thats the closest im gonna get, but still its not close. it tears me up. my insides are an emotional battlefield that hasnt ended yet, and im running out of troops. its sad, and true.

bottom line: I HATE WORKING HARD FOR NOTHING.

thank you, and have a nice night"

<center>And all our sins,
Come back to haunt us in the end,
To hang around and tap us on the shoulder,
And smile silent,
It's all implied,
You'll die trying to live this down,
You might as well forget it,
Still I'm convinced,
Wondering what if is the worst thing there is,

So we bottled and shelved all our regrets,
Let them ferment and came back to our senses,
Drove back home and slept a few days,
Woke up and laughed at how stupid we used to be,

And all these lines fall short of what I had in mind,
A failed attempt to capsulize a feeling,
So I just try,
Fail and try and try again,
Someday I swear I'm going to get it,
Because I'm convinced that giving in is the worst thing there is,

So we bottled and shelved all our regrets,
Let them ferment and came back to our senses,
Drove back home and slept a few days,
Woke up and laughed at how stupid we used to be,

We'll get over it,
Sad, strong, safe, and sober,
We'll move forward,
And know where we went wrong,
But you can't go home again,
You can't go home again,
You can't go home again,
You can't go home again,
You can't go home again!
You can't go home again!
You can't go home again!!!

So we bottled and shelved all our regrets,
Let them ferment and came back to our senses,
Drove back home and slept a few days,
Woke up and laughed at how stupid we used to be.

EVER.


we were sitting there, she told us to read. but today was different, cuz like nobody read. we all just kinda sat around and talked. i was talking to steven and somehow frau decided to say ""go play the space game"". so me and steven did. we just kinda air threw stuff at eachother and then i won somehow. that was fun!!...also, we discussed journal entries. then lunch.

after lunch, she decided to go over the homework from the night before. i was called on for letter g? and it was the one where i had to give an example of the want chain. i referenced bill and ted, and the wyld stallyns, and it rocked. HARD.

after that...we were told to get into groups of 4 for a skit thing. we picked our group, it was me, micah, mike, and peter...but the rest of the class couldnt decide...SO frau decided to line everyone up and draft us into groups like that. of course, my group protested...it was SOO cool, cuz we screwed up her counting like twice, then calea cussed out jesse, which was funny, and frau threw her out. peter then said ""see what you get for numbering us off?""

once she finally got us numbered off...we all snuck to different groups. she decided that she miscounted...and then she GAVE UP. MY HARDASS GERMAN TEACHER GAVE UP. it was the coolest thing ever!!! like..there was a cosmic shift in the universe or something...but i liked it!!

anyway...me and anna talked for like a half hour today, but i dont think it helped much. well, maybe a little. i explained a little, but it wasnt quite where i wanted to get with a conversation. anna, i want you to know that i do miss you, and all it takes is a phone call and me doing nothing to have me come over to hang out. im still sorry about that one day. it was MY fault, and...well im sorry.

guys, i know im not the perfect person, and i know that i screw up a lot. but erin, why did you have to slap me in the head? none of those hurt (well, maybe a few), but for the last two and a half weeks, my head has hurt. CONSTANTLY. finally, it quit, just to be hit by you. its not a big deal i guess, but it still hurt. i wasnt doing anything mean, jsut stupid. plus, you all know that i do it all the time. im not exactly the brightest kid there is around (when it comes to doing things), but theres still no reason to hit me really hard like that.

also, amy, i dont konw if you read my entries or not, but this part's for you:

why do you hate me? i know i do stupid things, but we all do. so what if i messed with your mural? you painted over it anyway, and what's it matter anyway? i just penciled it in. also, your mom is the sweetest lady that i know, and your dad is a cool guy. i dont have any problems with them personally, but i still talk about them. i do that to everyone's parents. im sure iv done more, but thats all i can even think of that i might have done to make you mad at me.

so why do you hate me so much?

is it because you think that im a horrible moron? still thats no reason to be mean to me. i hear all the rude comments you make about EVERYTHING i say. so what if the things that are said arent exactly intelligent? when are they ever in band? nobody says anything REALLY smart ALL the time...but you arent mean to them? i dont get it

is it because i dont respect you? i believe that respect is something that should be earned, not given out. thus far, you havent done much to earn my respect. in fact, you have done the opposite. being mean to your enemies isnt a way to get respect.

i dont really care if you stop hating me or not. well, actually i do, because you're not that bad of a person. BUT even if you dont stop hating me, would you at least try to not be so mean? it really gets to me.

"event","today was looooong...well, actually it wasnt...lol

i got up early, went to work. that was short, but hella tiring for some reason. oh yea, teh firework display was pretty cool, but iv seen better. yesterday i did a lot of random driving, and i bumped into jazzy and her brother and a bunch of crazies at the carnival. there was a picture of jesus as a prize for a dart game. it was...disturbing...a little...anyway, after the FW, i went pee (ahh!) and we got lunchables and i got real cold-like, cuz we ate it at a picnic table and it was cold...

right...back to today...

so work..then i went to sheena's for dinner. it was nice to see her again, she's changed soo much tho. it was fun, except for when i went in her room to get some wsu marching band crap....because there was...religion...eww...like..she had a picture of jesus, lots of quotes, and...just...ew.. she's changed a lot. ALSO at dinner, she stood and said grace for like 4 minutes. it made me really uncomfortable. iv had a few bad experiences with religion, and..it was uncomfortable. but dinner was really good, and i got this cool-ass mini-lightsaber thingie...overall, it was fun, just had a few bumpy spots.

afterward, on the way out the driveway, jazzy called, telling me that cressa's house is full of people. so i call, and mom's like ""NO"" then she calls back and is like..""well, allright, but be home at 10"" so i was like ""score!"". i got there and it was a mary kay party+mohgan+brian. jazzy was wearing a LOW cut tank top thingie, it was fun. it was actually kinda fun, and we watched the tony's. i didnt know anyone, because im a loser, but it was still fun. then i got in my car and left, cuz i had to go home. oh and i got gas on teh way. yup so here i am.

im supposed to be doing my homework, and then immona go to bed, cuz im really tired. ill talk to y'all tomorrow, have a rockin-ass night!"

..is this what it feels like? im so confused...i thought itd be different...but its very familiar and i feel like iv done this before. maybe..no, no, it cant be. things like that arent to be...well...italy'd

"event","so its been hella sunny out lately. nice, i guess, but a leather car isnt helping any.

...i wont be in school tomorrow...well, ill be in 4th period, because i cant miss another day of calculus

senior awards night, i got wasl cords, gold honor cords, a $5000 scholarship to WSU, and a $1000 skookum rotary scholarship. not bad for 2 hours, but still i feel empty. i feel...sad. like, truly sad. like....i did before. this is truly NOT good.

i dont know how to explain it. its like...everything you ever do seems not good enough for anyone, including yourself, and trying harder will only make you feel worse because you konw in the end you're just gonna let yourself down in the end. not only that, but you feel like...well, like everything you even try to attempt is just gonna piss someone off, and...i dont know. reading back on this it really doesnt do a good job explaining. its like...suicidal depression i guess, and i kinda know whats spurring it, but i dont like it, and you're not gonna hear about it, because the mood im in tells me that nobody really cares. but im not gonna do anything, i know better.

....i think...



but yea, i dont know. i should be happy for all the crap iv done, but i feel this deep lament, a deep sadness for what i could have done all through my life that i havent. all i feel is sad, its making me really...well even sadder...a few points i guess to point out:
>i got my hopes up for nothing, i really only got 1 scholarship, and i hoped that i could get more, but then again i didnt work hard enough.
>jazzy left, and i didnt get to say goodbye
>my mom and dad congratulated me, but i can sense that $6000 isnt good enough for them.
>i didnt work hard enough through high school and i expected a lot out of it
>i just realized how much i miss ryan johnson. he was such a caring person, and if i had to classify him under one word, i knew that it'd be invincible. that kid was so full of life, so...happy...i dont konw how to describe it. he was my invincible hero. but since he died, i feel vulnerable, i feel...like if my invincible hero could die, whats that say for the rest of the world? or, more specifically, me?
>its so hot that its messing with my brain


i dont care to explain anymore. its to the point where i just want somebody here to make me happy, and there's very few who can do that. i just want a friend, but nobody's here. its like...the past, like i was. i feel exactly like i did back then. EXACTLY. and its not good. not at all.

iv been listening to the same underoath song for a long time, a lot of times...its called ""some will seek forgiveness, others escape"". lyrics go like this:

<center>I heard a voice through the discord
A deluge of passersby
I saw one gaze frozen in time
Watching me passing by

I swear I'll know your face in the crowd
And I'll hear your voice so loud
When you're whispering

Hey unfaithful I will teach you
To be stronger
Hey ungraceful I will teach you
To forgive one another

Here's my kiss to betray
Desperate to brush the lips of grace
Do you feel hollow when you think of how I lied?

Oh sweet angel of mercy
With your grace like the morning
Wrap your loving arms around me
Oh sweet angel of mercy
With your grace like the morning
Wrap your loving arms around me

Hey unfaithful I will teach you
To be stronger
Hey ungraceful I will teach you
To forgive one another

Hey unfaithful I will teach you
To be stronger
Hey unloving
I will love you
And will love you

Jesus I'm ready to come home
I'm ready to come
Jesus I'm ready to come home
Unfaithful
Ungraceful
And unloving
I will love you
</center>

i totally dont want to feel like this anymore, im tired of it. i hate of what it did to me, im tired of whats its doing to me, im scared of whats its going to do to me. maybe im crazy, maybe i shouldnt be here. maybe i should be in one of those asylums with the white walls and the people who talk to you like you're crazy...because you are. 

...maybe...no...i dont want to think about that.

this type of thing makes me wish i was good at poetry or something. i have all these feelings that i want and need to get out, but i cant, because im no good at writing. or anything, really. iv been to europe, and i can play trumpet. thats really all. im just a big loser.

...i dont know, i dont understand. i thought i was better, i thought i was done feeling like this. now that i have no particular reason to feel like it, its back. i know that all that stuff isnt whats really happening. i know i have people there for me, i know that they care. but why cant i convince myself of that? why cant...i be normal?


...just know...i really want you here, and i miss you terribly. im sorry...i dont want to scare anyone off. its easier to type and talk about these things when im alone, and all i need is one friend here...physically...for me to be okay. til then, this is how i feel.

...dont leave...i need you..."

so anyway, my niece and nephew are here. ny niece is 4 and a half, but you wouldnt know it. she's almost as small as my nephew, who's like less than a year, and she cant talk well at all. like...she's talked the same ever since she learned how to talk. bad parenting? maybe, my sister in law IS really lazy, but im not going to say anything, cuz i have no idea what its like.

anyway...iv been so bored lately...sickness totally sucks.

also, i had so much to drink and eat this weekend and today? ( i have no idea why theres a ? there, but im not gonna change it, i think i like it... ) i ate like 20 cups of noodlesoup broth, plus all the noodles, plus all that i added, plus like 4 liters of sprite, plus like 50 crackers. i think im gonna get fat...lol eww...

hmm...my cage class is retarded. i need 15 freaking hours of community service! the most that any other cage class has is 4. <u>4.</u> i dont think that's at all fair. my dad doesnt either, he thinks taht we all arent getting the same learning experience, plus we arent all lazy ass teachers who have 15 hours to spare all the time. i mean, i have to work, and i have band, and a lot of places i could do service at are during the times im in school or at work. so im faced with a dilemma. and its all because of stupid-ass cage teachers like frau fortier. its so lame, you have no idea. i think ill have to be pulled out of school at least twice in the next 2 weeks, probably more, because im volunteering at bordeaux. these 3 words sum it up, then the next 5 sum up more. I HATE CAGE. and then...I DONT GET OUR GOVERNMENT.

anyway...im done, i have to write an essay for cage too, and i had to do 2 worksheets, and i had to write 2 articles, and all of this is from missing one day...so when you guys complain about having too much stuff to do, dont, cuz its nothing compared to a full-time work schedule + band + cage + being sick.

anyway, im totally done. i have talked and rambled on for too long. ill see all of you tomorrow, have a nice night!"

i guess it just hit me that im graduating. ill be gone. im leaving everything ive worked so hard for behind. my friends, my family, the life ive built, all gone. its not like i can just make new friends in college, it was sooo hard to make the friends i have now. im not like most of you guys.

...and it allhappens in 24 days. summer doesnt count, because my lame parents are gonna make me work through all of it. 

its not only that everything i know will be gone, but i keep looking back at how i was and realizing that i wasted my life thus far. all the sadness, all the stupid things ive done, all the times i could have been doing something and didnt, all wasted. ive done nothing to prepare myself for my future.

i cant see any good. so what if youll all be across the state? thats an entire state away, and i dont know if im going to bring my car to college, because i dont have my parents credit card to pay for it, plus im not that great of a driver anyway. my car costs me $168 a month. if not for my parents, it'd cost me well over $450 per month. which reminds me, i have done NOTHING to deserve ANYTHING that i have. <u>NOTHING.</u> seriously, i wonder why some of you guys like me at all. im always a bummer, and i dont help with anything. i have no special skills, and i hurt more than i help. why do yall like me anyway? im not that good of a person. just ask my parents. and my co-workers. and...pretty much everyone.

...im truly sad. and i have no reason to be. so what that im leaving? im going to go make a name for myself, go do something worthwhile finally. but i just cant help feeling this deep sadness for leaving. ill truly miss everyone, and ill miss some more than ill miss others. but...i just dont know. im finding less and less reason to feel happy nowadays...but some of you guys help.

im not saying that you shouldnt be sad that your senior friends are leaving, im saying that its not as hard as it could be. i truly will miss some of you, and certainly wont miss some of you, and i dont know how im gonna function without one of you. so...yea thats my thoughts on graduating. i dont want to anymore. but whats gotta get done's gonna get done, so immona have to deal. but it'll be tough.

it is not your place to say what you know about me. we all have our flaws, some more than others, and theres nothing that can be done about it. as a person, i realize this, but APARENTLY you dont. its NOT your place to disclose my personal information ANYWHERE. it's my business...and if you know ANYTHING about ANYONE AT ALL, you should at least know that is the best way to make enemies. we all hate SOMEONE, and when we find out who, we WILL make your world hell. you know that. SO WHAT THE FUCK?? do you enjoy playing god or something? no, you arent even playing god anyway. youre just kicking your own ass into the ground. how do you live with you? of the people you left comments to, you have pissed off 100% of them. THAT'S ALL OF THEM. what else would happen if you were to tell people how to run their lives? someone's going to find you, and when they do, you wont want to live anymore. i will make sure of that. you will want to bleed out every last drop that courses through your cold veins, and that STILL wont be enough for you. the peace of death will be far beyond you, because you dont deserve it. you have no idea how much damage you have done. you have stirred my thoughts and caused them to be plagued with what i used to be, and if YOU KNOW ME AT ALL then you'd know that is the LAST thing you'd want. all i have left to say is that if you dont stop, we will find you. you dont want that, so i see only one option for you. KNOCK IT OFF. the damage you have done is irreversable, so dont even bother, i can fix it myself, without YOUR fucked-up advice."

"event","yesterday was a blast. i went to mohgan's house and we got our cars washed, then my mom's. then we watched bill and ted's excellent adventure. good good muvy. mm....then i went to the jazz band thangie, and then i went to bryce's. we went to dairy queen and i made a really long straw and drank mt dew from it. it was tough, and it made my lungs hurt. i went home...and slept.

i woke up this morning feeling very sad. like...i have no idea why. i guess i feel really lonely today, and i cant go anywhere because i need to work on a cage assignment. i dont know, i just want to hang with a friend or two today. i feel really sad, its bad. like...im completely unmotivated to even begin my project stuff, and normally i like making posters.

mmm...its about noon. im done

no, im not. i just figured out why im sad i think. i always read about how everyone has all these jam-packed, awesome days, but i never really do. i mean, i have maybe like 1 per week or something, but no more than that. im usually stuck sitting at home, waiting for a call or a message, or something. on top of that, my stupid mom always tells me to ""go help outside before you leave"" if i have somthin to do. so i go outside, and it turns out that my dad has no respect for what i want to do, and forces me to work with him until i have to actually go to work or sogo or somthing un-fun and planned, so i miss out on whatever i was gonna do for the day. PLUS whenever something cool happens, i dont hear about it until AFTER it's over. why is that?

sorry, im just feelin like venting to someone, but since no one is here (like usual) i have to do it on a fucking livejournal. mmm...i guess now im mad as hell at all of my friends, well most of them, and REALLY mad at my parents

'twas very good, but i freaking emptied like 100 sugar packets to make it. yucky! on a lighter note, i rediscovered i can climb up stuff effectively...yay! jazzy, you're gonna climb up that eventally, and we are totally gonna FIGHT no matter what you say! well, first you're gonna have to teach me to kick ass, then we can FIGHT.

yup.. i really am tired, and i have homework to do. bye bye birdie is rawkin, but i feel like im not contributing as much as i should be, mainly cuz i cant dance at all...i mean im not the only one that thinks so...lol i really need help, but i suppose that some of us are beyond help? yea? yea...that's definately me.

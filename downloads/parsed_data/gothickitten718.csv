"event","um....wow, i didn't know that spending so much time with someone makes you fall in love so quickly. okay, it's been 8 months since me and sam met, but still, it's a short amount of time for me. i spent 3 years with someone... that's a long time. Yes, sam, you have captured my heart, and yes, i do like you. but, what if you don't like me? what if you...couldn't ever care for someone like me? i'm sorry i can't confront you face to face on this, but it takes me to write it down before i say something, so i don't get my words all scrambled up. or maybe it may take someone to show this to you before you get the hint that i do like you. no noone was lying, i do. okay. i do. some people say you make it obvious that you like me, but what if...there's still that small chance that you don't...maybe you're just being nice. or you're just friendly like that with a lot of girls. i don't know. 

anway...
...to update on the brother issue, he's doing fine. but..that doesn't mean i don't still worry. he's still left in the hands of my mother, and i will never stop worrying as long as he's still living there. i let him down way too many times, i am not bound to let that happen again. I told him the first time she hit him that she would never do it again, and i let him down 4 times, i am <b><u>NOT</b></u> going to let it happen again. I don't care if i have to walk there and back everyday, i will do it. I love him as if he was my own son. It is my responsibility as a sister to not <b>let</b> him get hurt. i am his sister, i should be there to say it's okay and it breaks my heart that i'm not.

and school....well it's boring. but i am doing a lot better. but there are some immature fuckin assholes in the 8th grade. their doing shit like breaking plates in the cafeteria and running around like maniacs during lunch which caused a radical change during lunch which now we have to sit in assigned seats by homeroom. I used to look forward to lunch and just sitting there eating and talking with my friends, but no some fuckfaces have to ruin it for us. and that's besides the fact that the whole 8th grade has the worst grades in the history of northgate. look, we have a lot more privleges than we ever did in Sto and you assholes have to ruin it for everybody. I hate everyone in the whole 8th grade. There's only a few people actually mature enough to have a conversation with like Jillian, Katelyn, and possibly John. a lot of people are going to have a rude awakening when reality finally slaps them in the face. 

and adam, he's acting weird. there's not much to say about him anymore i've given up he apparently dont' care anymore.    </3

well...i'm hungry & i should eat before my dad flips out again."

"event","okay...yea yea, i haven't been updating. but...me and adam are in an argument. I guess I shouldn't have said anything, but... god he aggrivates me sometimes. I just wish he would leave, sometimes. or just leave me alone. n' then when i get mad at him, he wonders why. well back off! im not his girlfriend, im nothing to him... then why does he bother me so much? i think i love him. but i don't know. it's confusing and weird. But really, i don't care, anymore. He could stay mad at me for years...as long as he doesn't talk to me, about me, think about me, or even look at me. God it aggrivates me that i love him to death, and he could care a less. well i'll grant his wish and leave him alone and just hope he does the same, as well.
well i updated...
...and i'm in school. so i should go and actually do my work.

much love,

"event","heh, after we were chillin at my house yesterday we went to cassie's. Cassie's mom got pissed cause she had cory over when no one was home -_-; so, me and cory left. we went to adam's and talked about the concert then started watching some movies...
...when we finished watching the first movie (i forget what it's called) we watched dungeon's and dragons. 
anyway...when me and adam were sitting in the corner he just looked at me all glittery-eyed and i looked back at him all glittery-eyed and he smirked at me and kissed me. haha. 

but...matt....
....oh god. I don't know what to do. 

a couple nights ago after we bombed natasha's house with snowballs, i looked over at him and said ""you really hate that bitch, don't ya?"" and he was like ""yea. she knows that i like you way more than i ever liked her"" and i just stood there like ""O.O;"" then ""-_-;;"" then he gave me a quick hug and ran off. 

i don't understand it anymore. i just...
...i wanna be left alone. I want the one I <b>love</b> and that's it. no one else. yet there's a total of 31 guys that like me and 2 girls, god, what the fuck. all i want is to be friends, if it seems like anymore than that, i'm sorry. i love you guys and all it's just..i can't right now. i can't really <b>love anyone</b> right now. it's just...too complicated and i'm in some really deep shit and i can't take it right now.

omg i'm rambling. okay...well i'm gonna go before katelyn and leann get over... so

peace

"event","Yay, another day with adam. 
Yea, I love the kid. But I don't know what to do, I'm stuck in this situation. I mean, I wanna date him, yet he still has to prove a lot more to me...i mean, it's not like he hasn't. He's proven a lot, but still, i'm scared. 
I love him, yes. But trust him? no. and what's a relationship without trust, right? I mean, I could grow to trust him, right? Yes, of course i can. But will I? I don't know. 
I'm just fooling myself again. Going somewhere I shouldn't. 
But I'm just so oblivious to everything. augh x.x 
i want everything to go away and only be me and him. God, I love him. I am so happy. I'm finally so happy again. I missed him so much. 
But what's funnny is, when his friends and shit were threatening me...he doesn't realize i could have his ass kicked with the snap of my fingers. But...no. I cared. I love him. And there's nothing you guys can say/do to change that. 
He said ""Crys, why? I treat you like shit and you're still by my side..."" and I stopped him in his words and said ""Adam, from the beginning I told you I will always remain by your side"" and he hugged me and said ""Same here, crys. luv ya"" <3

gotta love that adam kid.

oh and...john B,you're dating katelyn....why are you so mad that i don't like you? jeeze you people are weird. get a life. i'm nothing. i'm a piece of shit, not worth anything. I'm not gonna get anywhere in life. I'm just gonna be a hard core stoner bitch...and remember, i'm a two faced, caniving, cheating little bitch.

"event","hm, yea my memory totaly went oblivious before going to adam's house yesterday. So, yea... 
I love when i just start assailing at everyone for no reason, lately. It's hilarious when they are conjuring me, and i just lull them into my little automaton. It's not my fault I'm adroitness. 
I abated the level of hatred for everyone else, though. But, I did it so perseveringly. Well, I am impious due to the fact I have no respect for other's opinions and shit like that...eh, whatever. I don't care of other's thoughts and/or feelings. Althougth it does fraught me in a way, but I have no reason to let it bother me. I do everything for a reason, there is nothing I regret.

but anyway..
the adam kid...hm... he is fuckin asphyxiating me so bad. He never lets me get any time of my own. He's always at my house and/or making me come to his. I mean, I love the kid, but I'm not his anymore. He needs to get that through his thick skull. Yea I know I missed him terribly while we were fighting, but for god's sake, now he's suffocating me. There are just some times where I need to be left alone. And in school, he's always fearful when a guy holds my hand or hugs me or even gives me a little kiss. Jesus christ, give me a break. 

I'm not that special..
and there's another guy added to my little list of 'people that are stuck in lust'. 
I'm nothing special
I'm not popular
I'm not talented besides my drawings and poetry and that's even a doubt
I'm not respectful
I treat everyone like shit
And I'm most definately not pretty...
so wtf?! 

get over me, go away, and get a life.

Sorry I haven't updated, a lot of shit has went down and before i said anything I wanted to make sure everything's okay. 

Well,
[x] me and adam are back on level
[x] zeke broke up with his girlfriend....uh o.o;;;
[x] erin's all blah
[x] savannah came over and we had a great time at a funeral laughing our asses off about two weekends ago! ^_^
[x] me and nan burned water..o.o
[x] mommy loves me
[x] been hit in the ass so many times by snowballs
[x] went to ambers party lastweekend. woosh. 
[x] did anyone know that leeman has his tongue pierced?..uh...well i found out. 
[x] everyone thinks i'm a lezbian. LMAO XD
[x] had parties in my room and make out sessions. lmao 
[x]...and he loves me. o.o



adam came over today. *swooshes*
he couldn't stop cuddling with meh. ^_^;; 
...i think i still love him...
but why the hell does he keep coming back to me?
One day i complimented him and he's like ""Don't talk to me, then when a guy punched me adam slammed him o.o. then when his ""friends"" talk shit on me he like tells 'em off. and everytime i finally fuckin get over the kid he comes back, and it's ironic that everytime you swear that you hate the guy that broke your heart, when he comes back your arms are wide open! wtf?!?


 Think I'm crazy, baby, let you off 
 the hook too easy.   if you were a
 telephone,  you'd still be off the
 hook.    this is my last leg, been
 awake   for days. in a minute i'll
 die of starvation.  i'll come back
 a ghost if i can haunt you.    and
 float around your room.  what do i
 do when you get close? if i kissed
 your neck,               would you
 slit           my          throat?

     i waste all my time just
     thinking   about    you."

by: Crys
Lost in a feeling that's so unreal, my mind, this grip, it begins to reel. What's this, heavy weight on my chest? Concrete thoughts that now seem stressed. Tumultuous being, an exitence disturbed, once so grounded, no perturbed. Once so clear, no all smeared. I turned my head, and you appeared. And you, and angel, an imposing light. Blinding, burning, a youth so bright. An exotic manner, fresh and new. Has ruptured all I thought I knew. An emotion, impossible to exist. Lips, too impossible, that I kissed. Hands, so impossible, that I held. This weight it grew, this perplexity swelled. Sturdy ground, now waves of confusion. The stone, shaken by such intrusion. Giving away neath my weakened feet. So impossible, yet so wonderfully sweet. Changed, I bacame, so changed by you. Altered eyes through which I view. Enthralled, I am, lost in this bliss. This damage, that one impossible kiss. What now? I ask, no that I am lost. All of the lines, you have crossed. I wade in these depths, your impossible hand. I hold, cling to it, in this strange land. So unbelieveable, so incredibly untrue. So enchanted, so overcome by you. This new feeling, I hold it so tight. I give in, and bathe in your impossible light."

"event","Dawn of the New World
By: Crys
Under the broken sky and amidst shattered dreams, all sit immobilized by the angels' screams, and the destruction of heaven as hell prevails while minions laugh and tell tales of His agonizing wails. Somehow I'm still left, surrounded by dreams of my own that I have become nothing more than tired, muffled moans, and I watch as the demons all father and play; -it's ring- around- the-rosy on Judgement Day. Over the lands, the darkness begins to cross and engulf the beauty while the angels mourn their loss. Those minions that were idle decide to play more evil, with shards of dreams they cackle with each angel they kill. Desperation echoes but there's no rescue for them in sight; Satan watches proudly and laughs on into the eternal night. And there's never pity, no second thoughts of dismay; No guilty conscience on Judgement Day. -""Ring around the rosy, pockets full of posies..."" I watched the end of my world pass right by me. And before the day is done Satan gains his new crown, ""Ashes, ashes, we all fall down..."""

We talked, hugged, snuggled, watch a movie, kissed, slept, and loved. 
While we were talking, I remember it word for word, he was like ""Crys, I'm sorry"" and I
was like ""um, for what?"" he said ""For hurting you. You didn't deserve any of that shit. 
I just nodded and said ""Adam, how can I believe you?"" he looked me in the eyes, grabbed my arms and said ""Look, Crystal, I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say, I was wrong. I was stupid"".... then we snuggled and I said ""It's fine""

...I miss him. When I see him, I'm gonna huggle him to death! 
Jeeze, I wouldn't know what to do if I would really have to let him go like that, >.> I would would feel so alone. I mean, not friends wise, I always know I have you guys jeeze, I wouldn't know what to do without my friends either. But, adam, it's different. I love Savannah also. Savannah will always have that special place in my heart, that no one would <b>EVER</b> be able to take, no matter how much she thinks I don't love her anymore, it's just not true... it's just not possible. 11 years is gonna be really hard to beat, Nan. I don't think <u>ANYONE</u> could beat what we have, as our sisterhood. NO ONE!
And as of Adam...wow... I would go into a state so cold, so numb, if I ever had to let any of them go. Savannah & Adam mean the world to me, along with other friends. But... it's just, different realtionships is all. 
Nan, yes, I love Adam, but no, he could never take that special place, like you did. I can't really explain it. 

I'm sorry if I bummed anyone for not being where they wanted me to be today, but I had to see my brother. I'm sorry... I couldn't miss this chance, it might have been my last. And what I'm most certainly afraid of, is he might be...forgeting about me. Forgeting what I use to do for him. I just miss him so much, I want him back. He's <b>my</b> boy! My ""son"". I took care of him from day one! I want to hold him again, and be able to tell him everything's gonna be okay. But this time it would be the truth. I love you Brandon, don't give up. Never give up, son."

You're like my favorite damn disease

And I hate the places that we go
And I hate the people that you know
And I hate the way you can't say No
Too many long lines in a row
I hate the powder on your nose

And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)

And now I know who you are

Gone for good, and this is it 

 

btw... get many many many many people.... I feel the need to bleed. 

Love ya,

First of all, I still don't regret saying was I said. You guys hurt me really bad. I woud bend over backwards and break my spine for you guys, I would shed blood for all you. I love you guys so much....and it just seems that, it doesn't matter. I don't matter. I don't know what I would do without you guys. I would die for you all...

Adam:
I want to tell you how I feel, but even if I do, it wouldn't matter.
God, I love you, and you use to love me, but we can never be together
because we could get hurt or fall more in love. Damn, I need you so 
bad but I can't let this kill me because I know you're happy. Maybe
not. But it kills me to see you with those other girls, and the things
they do, and you do, and you know it's like a dull blade thru my heart.
So what if you never come back? So what if I think about you more than
anyone ever should? You're <b>ALWAYS</b> on my mind. <b>ALWAYS</b>. And you 
always have me. I can't get away from you, you're like a goddamn 
addiction. The compassion that I have for you cannot be described.
It's the way I feel when I see you, hear about you, feel you, or are
even in your prescence. I never thought I'd love anyone like this.
</b>ANYONE</b>. But everytime I see you I fight back tears. You tell me not to cry but I can't do anything.
I want to hate you, but I can't. I love you. You 'loved me'. Love love love.

Feh.

whaetver I just said, I made an ass outta myself. o.O

"event","Since Candy and I have do-nothing jobs, we tend to venture forth onto teh Intarwebnetz to retain our sanity. However, sometimes that doesn't help.<br /> <br /> Candy linked me to <a href=""http://www.parentdish.com/2008/07/25/jon-and-kate-are-they-good-enough-parents-for-tv/"" target=""_self"">this story</a> about ""Jon and Kate Plus Eight"". Yeah, sure... Call me a vag for it, but I actually like the show. I think it's fucking funny, to be honest. Plus Candy and I are a lot like Jon and Kate. She gets mad and I get super sarcastic. LOL<br /> <br /> Anyhow, if you've clicked the link above (where it says ""<a href=""http://www.parentdish.com/2008/07/25/jon-and-kate-are-they-good-enough-parents-for-tv/"" target=""_self"">this story</a>""), you'll see that the author is an utter fucktard. Jon and Kate are apparently bad parents because they don't let their kids get dirty and Kate abuses Jon because she's honest and gives him light ""love taps"". Seriously, WTF?<br /> <br /> So... What do I do? I write a comment on the article. They probably won't actually post it to the site for a few reasons, mainly being that it's too long, articulate, and intelligent. Sites that allow comments seem to only allow fucktards to comment, spouting about things completely unrelated to the article.<br /> <br /> Anyhow, here's my comment.<br /> <div style=""margin-left: 40px;""><br /> I'd love to see you wrangle eight kids, allowing them to get dirty/messy, and be nice 24/7. When you decide to throw yourself off the roof of a building because you've lost your mind, I'll suggest a few nice buildings from which you can do so.<br /> <br /> For having eight children, I think they have things quite together. Imagine what it would take to get eight children clean after allowing them to get dirty. It's hard enough just to get them dressed, and you want Jon and Kate to allow the kids to go jumping in the muck?<br /> <br /> On the subject of how Kate treats Jon, they've addressed that on camera. Both of them agree that sometimes you really just don't have time to be nice. With eight children running around, you have to get to the point and get to it quickly. They understand that they're not actually being mean to each other. On top of that, I guess you've been too busy berating Kate for being mean to Jon to notice the snarky (that means sarcastic, cuz something tells me you'd have to look that up) remarks that Jon throws at Kate. It's really fairly even.<br /> <br /> As far as the physical abuse... I've never seen anything that I would consider hurtful. She gives him ""love taps"" as she calls them. He calls them ""abuse,"" but... To be honest, have you ever heard a serious thing come out of Jon's mouth? He's the most sarcastic man I've ever seen on TV.<br /> <br /> And in reference to the article to which you link... The Duggars are model parents? Wow, there's a model for the feminist movement. She just pops out kid after kid after kid after kid... She doesn't do anything for herself. At this point, she's almost constantly pregnant, which I'm sure also makes it difficult for her to give proper care to her younger children. Model parenting from somebody who thinks of her womb as a clown car? I think not.<br /> <br /> </div> After writing that, Candy sent me <a href=""http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/645743/jon_kate_plus_8_kate_was_wrong.html?cat=39"" target=""_self"">another article</a> about Kate being wrong. This one made me laugh. I didn't comment on it on the source site because it doesn't allow for comments that I can see (if it does, the web designer is yet another fucktard that didn't make things easier). However, I'll comment here... <br /> <br /> Why do the parents of today simply insist on raising a breed of pussies that can't deal with problems? Oh, no!!! Kate hurt her daughter's feelings!!! Whatever shall she do!? The article makes it out like the daughter's permanently damaged by one incident. Seriously. She'll get over it. The author should, too."

"event","Sometimes you wake up and you notice something's changed. You get so used to living a certain way that even when they do change, you don't even realize it. I've personally gotten so used to things being craptastic, and I've grown somewhat desensitized to such things.

Well... This morning I woke up and that my life is great and has been for quite a while!

Why the sudden realization? I haven't a clue. All I know is that there's plenty of great things in my life and I'm actually quite happy! 

First, I have to thank my wonderful girlfriend and my friends, cuz they're pretty fucking awesome. Candy is gorgeous, sweet, funny, silly, sarcastic, fun, and proves that she's a capabable holder of a degree, teacher/tutor, and student of life. Also, Candy loves me in ways I've never known. Keith, Danielle, and Dee are the definition of people that have gone that step beyond friendship. They're family. They're there for me whenever I need them to support and defend me or just to be a bunch of dorks and have fun. They're those people that can go over my house when I'm not there and they're welcome to sit with my family and BS, eat my food, and just hang out.

I actually have a great job, too! I'm now an administrative assistant at a merchandising company. It's great because it's the other side of retail! It's Randall Graves' ideal job, considering he said ""You know, this job would be great if it weren't for the customers."" I deal with the stores and products themselves and I get to use the knowledge I've amassed over the past 8 years. :)

Having such a job affords me the ability to actually go with Candy to Oregon for my ""sister"" Jenn's wedding! LEAVING NEW JERSEY!!! OOOH YEAH!!! [dances around like a dork]

Also, I've got a decently running muscle car. How many people can say that they have a pretty sweet 1994 Mustang GT in the not-so-common Dark Forest Green Metallic? Mostly middle aged men that drive like wusses get the cars with balls. 

And finally, I actually have a band coming together that's going to just kick your ass! Yours truly on guitar, Dee on vocals, Keith on guitar, my brother Patrick on bass, and my brother David on drums. :)

So, yeah. Life fucking rocks and I just felt the need to scream it out for once. :)"

"event","Disclaimer: This is not a post to start trouble. This is not to point fingers at anybody. These are my feelings on life, and should be considered as such. Any childish, high school remarks will be ignored, but left alone, so that those childish remarks can be the proof of their own legacy.

The more I go through life, the more I realize people cause their own pain and suffering. I do it to myself, sometimes, but most of the time I catch myself. I learned that the hard way when I freaked out on my midget without a really good reason. I also find that out every time somebody just can't open their mouth in public and say out they feel. Why is everything such a secret? Why do people hold things in until they blow up out of control? Why do people whine and get all emo over little things?

People thing friendships are finished because of relationships. I find that to be complete utter bullshit. I haven't lost Danielle or Keith (both of them my friend before they were together) because of their relationship. They haven't lost me cuz of Ellie. It's because we talk. We have communication. We don't hide shit from each other. We're family. Any good friendship is based on communication skills. I've known Keith for a long time, but Danielle I've known for much less time, and Ellie for a very short time, but they're all on equal ground with me. For a minute or a millennium, friendship is friendship, and if it's a true friendship on both parts, that will never, ever end. I know I'll be an old 80 something year old guy with a walker chasing Ellie around and Keith and Danielle will just roll their eyes at me and say ""Typical Tom!""

I got angry at Ellie because she held something back about how she felt to me. I told her such. I told her that she needs to communicate these things to me, because there's no secrets between us. Yeah, I'm angry, but I'll get over it. It's because I communicated my feelings and she now does as well. It's not one of those stupid little high school relationships where one little thing can blow the whole deal apart.

People also need to get over things that get blown out of proportion and misread. I hear things things that were really nothing still being talked about. Amongst other completely untrue things, I've been accused of being a racist. I have black friends. Ellie has black friends. I mean, c'mon, she lives in Jersey City! She wouldn't have lived to be 24 if she were a racist white girl in Jersey City! I made a simple off-color remark and it got totally blown out of proportion. I didn't mean to offend anybody, and I'm sorry for that, but people that don't know me shouldn't judge me, and people that claim to know me should simply know better. What's wrong with eggplants anyway? It's over. Seriously, GET OVER IT. And that's not the only thing. JUST GET OVER IT! I know I graduated high school almost 8 years ago, and I thought I left gossip bovine feces behind.

Holding back your feelings causes nothing but trouble. Secrets kept turn into lies perpetuated. Lie perpetuated turn into anger. Anger turns into lost friends.

There are certain people in my life I can count on. I call them family. Regardless of their relationship status, we'll always be friends, 'til the day we die, and I love them with all of my heart.

I'm just tired of everybody pointing fingers and crying foul. If people can redeem themselves, I don't hold grudges. Hell, aren't I the one that infamously has always let people walk all over me? However, I've learned that people can't redeem themselves on the surface but continue to be shady, because I'm tired of being walked on.

I'm not perfect. I make mistakes. I screw things up. I've even had trouble taking my own advice. But, unlike most people, I try to learn from my mistakes and grow from them. If you see me making a mistake, tell me as a friend. Don't point it out as a character flaw and hate me for it without giving me a chance to rectify the situation. That's what I feel happens too often."

"event","I know it's probably wrong for me to talk about this here in this manner, but I'm suffering from insomnia, and all these thoughts are bubbling... So, here we go!

I'm having a little trouble lately. I have some emotions for Danielle that I'm simply not supposed to have. She's a wonderful girl that embodies everything I want, but she has her own problems, and I feel as though I'm adding to them. I feel immensely guilty for that, and for simply being so emotionally attached to her when she can't possibly be as emotionally attached, even if she wanted to (which she sometimes appears to want to be like that). Let's just say that she was in a emotional cage for a long time, and even though the door's open, she's afraid to come out, and she believes she's out and free, but she's just in a cage with an open door. I don't intend to cage her, but I guess at this point in her life, a relationship would be another cage, as far as she sees it. What hasn't sunk into her sweet little skull yet is that while her ex neglected her and made her stop being herself to make him happy, for me she MUST be herself and she MUST go out with her friends (like Natalia, Melissa, and Nicole, who all ROCK) and she MUST understand that shes doesn't have to do all the work in the relationship because if she wasn't willing to be herself, she wouldn't be the girl I fell for anymore. I'm putting pressure on her that she doesn't deserve, but I don't know what to do. I can't stop feeling the way I do, but she can't handle that right now. So I'm in a catch-22. UGH! Somebody just make thing simple like they used to be! Guy likes girl, girl likes guy back, guy and girl go out. I wish I could go back and erase all the shit that this beautiful angel has had to deal with, cuz it's really, REALLY unfair to her, especially because, whereas if she were free of the bullshit, I'd probably be a delight to her, I've become stress and confusion. How much does it suck when the girl does like the guy back, but she just can't handle it. [sigh] Somebody pray for me, and keep other girls away from me, cuz I don't want them, and I'll just break their hearts. I don't know what the future brings, but all I know is that I've known exactly what I wanted in a girl YEARS ago, and described the girl that I wanted to friends many times, and then I met Danielle, only to find that she embodied all the qualities that I want, physically, emotionally, and personality-wise. I may be setting myself up for huge disappointment, but I don't want to push her away, and I'm willing to wait as long as it takes to see if she realizes she wants to be with me. She has the key to my heart. Let's see if she uses it."

I want to kill the Grimis so I can have John back. I want a drummer, preferably my brother. I want to get Jess to work on her voice and prove that she has the potential to really rip up the vocals that I truly believe she has. If all of that's a pipe dream, I know a particular girl who can play bass and sing wonderfully that I'd love to get together and do things with. I'd still like to involve Keith in that because I feel that he and I are a great writing team, kinda like Lennon and McCartney. Even though our styles are completely different, I feel that they're the perfect compliment to each other and when we write, we write some fucking awesome stuff. A song he wrote at work in his head without a guitar is one of my favorite songs of all time and it gave me some confines in which to solo where I can prove that I can shine instead of noodling aimlessly. I really miss making music and I feel that it really is my life."

"event","Sometimes I feel that people misunderstand what love and friendships are. I've come to realize that people actually believe (incorrectly) that time is what makes a relationship strong and fruitful. People feel that simply because you've spent years saying you're boyfriend and girlfriend or friends that it's a good, healthy relationship. I find that to be totally wrong and I have a few examples of proof.

Somebody VERY close to me has been in a relationship for four years. Now a lot of people that I know would automatically say ""That's a great relationship!"". Not so. This person is miserable and disenchanted. The signifcant other in this relationship is extremely selfish and refuses to see my friend's side of anything and refuses to even drive to my friends house. Now things weren't always so bad, but most of the relationship has been a lot closer to this end result than it has been healthy.

On the other hand, I have a friend who I've only known since last summer. This friend is THE DEFINITION of a good friend. I've had friends for longer than this (fortunately they don't read LJ LOL) who SUCK at being friends... I'm missing a whole guitar due to one ""friend"", and a lot of other friends are very confrontational or have disappeared into the void. However this particular friend that is my example is somebody who I couldn't get rid of if I wanted to (and I'd be stupid if I wanted to!). This friend has been there for me every time I need help and of course understands that I'm the same way. We've enjoyed MANY good times together. This friend is a much better friend than a lot of people that I've known for years.

That doesn't mean that the people I have known for years are bad friends. The good ones know who you are and I'm glad to have you in my life.

However, I believe that the two above examples greatly express why I feel that time is a meaningless variable in a good relationship. If time is the only thing a person can say is holding two people together and they don't have anything else good to say about the current situation, maybe it's time to re-evaluate things. 

My band has a song called ""True Love Never Dies"". It's true. It can't be measured in years. It can only be measured in terms of your whole lifetime. The two specific friends I listed before are two people, among a select few, that I won't say ""I've been friends with them for X years."" I'll say ""They'll be my friends until the day I die."""

"event","I know what the title hints at, but I must say that my love life is better and more honest than it's ever been, so the problem isn't me. I'm just very disappointed in particular people and I've strengthened friendships with others all due to some stupid bullshit that went on for way too long. Certain people proved to me that their opinions are unbending even if their opposed with fact, and other people have proved to me that they should teach classes to everybody else on how to be a good human being. I'm glad to have the true friends that I have and I will go to hell and back for them unconditionally.

It's sad, but sometimes it takes childish bullshit to prove to you who your true friends are. People who I thought woud remain uninvolved opened their mouths. One person proved everything that I had previously believed was true, and another person went to bat for not only me, but the friends that I went to bat for. I deeply care for these people. I will do anything for them from serious stuff like fighting for their honor to stuff simply to make them happy, such as buying Wicked tickets. These people have proven to me that even if I change, they're there to give me advice and back me up when I'm right and tell me to my face when I'm wrong instead of hiding behind Live Journal. If I were a drinking man, I'd propose a toast to them.

On a brighter note, tomorrow is VAN HALEN!!! THE RETURN OF VAN HALEN TO NEW JERSEY! FUCKIN' A!!! If I get them done, I'm going to be wearing a pair of red Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars with black and white stripes, a la King Edward's Frankenstein artwork. I'm also slowly saving up for two things - one, all the parts to build an exact replica of Edward Van Halen's Frankenstein circa 1981-82, and the other, a new car! Gonna get myself a Mustang made between 1989 and 1995, depending on the price of the car and how much I have saved.

Hopefully Eddie, Alex, Mike, and Sammy will blow me away tomorrow evening! It's also going to be my brother Patrick's first ever concert! No better than THE MIGHTY VAN HALEN! VH was my first ever concert, so I think it's fitting. :)

And a politcal statement: Hey, Castro, fucking with the US will do nothing but embarass you! Fuckin' Dubbya's nuts on your beard!"

"event","Well, this weekend is the time to move! The F@#$ outta here! After 18 years of dealing with the douchebag (I hope he spontaneously bursts into flames in front of his family, burns down his house, and part of his house falls over and crushes his Lexus that he bought with our rent money that should've been used fixing our house), we're gone. Found a much nicer house across town that's gonna be more reasonable for the amount of people that are in this family. I'm happy, everybody else is happy, but my mom's being her usual paranoid self and freaking out about little things like gnats getting in the house (yes, she actually freaked out about that last night) and stuff like that. 

Well, for those of you looking for me, I may not have internet access 'til next week. Those of you cool enough to have my cell digits, just call me. I might not even have my own room line immediately after moving in... Who the hell knows what's going on. But I actually get cell reception in my house, now. :) Well, see ya guys on the flipside!"

While I'm not exactly running it, I have A LOT to do with <a href=""http://www.TheMusicDenOnline.com"">www.TheMusicDenOnline.com</a>, the e-commerce portion of The Music Den, the store I work for (<a href =""http://www.themusicden.com"">www.themusicden.com</a>). It's cool work, and much more gratifying than dealing with people that don't appreciate you and yell at you when you try to help them and get mad when you sell something to people that get there before they do. The only problem is that if you type in ""The Music Den"" on Google or something, it brings up EVERYBODY but us! LOL That's kinda why I'm writing this journal. :) Google bases it's search engine rankings partly on how many web pages link to another web page. So... Here I am linking. :-D Yeah, I know I'm a shmoe, but I wanna do well at my job. Make my bosses some cash, and it trickles down. My bosses are cool, though. They're not shmucks like most bosses I've had. They work pretty hard themselves and take care of ya. But overall, I'm happy with my job... If only I lived closer than 45 minutes away!

Other than work being great, life is pretty much the same. Still single. Trying to work an angle on getting DreamFire Amplification off the ground since my town's ""Code Enforcement"" department BLOWS. Gotta bring Johnny back to life. Going to see <a href=""http://www.van-halen.com"">VAN HALEN</a>!!! w00t! And I also ordered myself a <a href=""http://www.peavey.com/products/shop_online/browse.cfm/action/details/item/00394770/wc/1A1A112/fam/1A21/tcode/2/evh.cfm"">Peavey EVH Wolfgang in Sunburst</a>!

"event","Well, yeah... I've been delinquent in updating... Life's been rather repetitive until lately, so... [shrug]

<b><u>Bonuses:</u></b> 
Getting a free guitar and giving it to my bro Patrick. I sold a whole bunch of Fender gear, so Fender's hooking us all up. 5% of whatever we sold goes towards getting Fender shwag at MSRP. w00t! 

Ashwee's trying to hook me up with her friend Viv. She seems cool. I'm just leary as always, given my love life.

I actually got the huevos to ask our waitress out at Chili's. Brooke's got the bow chicka bow action going on, and she's cool, too. :) She's not like ""OMG! The sun! I swear! It's bleaching out my hair! 42? 24? I don't even know the score!"" Even though she has a BF, she said she was really flattered and would've loved to, and she said ""You never know, I might just break up with him one day"". LOL

Also, I'm looking to be entrepu... to start a business. LOL I've been up to my ears in tube amp schematics and part catalogs and I think I could handle building and repairing tube amps. I'm going to start out by modifying my 1969 (I said 69... he he he) Fender Bassman and see how it turns out. If it works well, I'll rope my brother into doing some of the more physical labor and we'll go into business. Just gotta think of a good name for the brand. :-D

<i><u>Downers:</u></i>
Danielle and I got dragged into some bullshit that a trouble making former friend of hers is starting with another friend of mine. While Danielle might not be angry, I am. People SERIOUSLY have no fucking lives and should really just STFU! I wish she would... No, I demand that she <font size=""+2"">EXPLODE</font>! I hate when people are miserable and, when they see that other people are VERY happy, they do whatever they can to make those people miserable just like them. And my mother wonders why I wish I carried a very large gun... Danielle's a sweetie and would never lie to anybody or do anything to hurt anybody. And I'm too fucking honest to do anything like this whore is doing. It's a good thing I don't hit girls, cuz I'd smack her bitch up.

Joe nailed yet another girl that one of us (namely me) wanted. Yeah, and Joe thinks he doesn't have Jedi powers. He doesn't need rufies. He does it all on his own, somehow. If you know Joe, and you're interested in a girl, NEVER INTRODUCE HIM TO HER! She'll go for him. Guaranteed.

Found out that I once, in my past, had mono... Weird. I don't remember having it. But I have Eppstein Barre. No wonder I'm always tired all day.

I've been going out a lot in the past week. Chilis or Crapplebees with Danielle and the boys. or pool or something. Comin' home late a lot. Just bustin' my hump. Got myself a new Fender Telecaster this past week. :) Gonna work on my obsession with David Gilmour of Pink Floyd and make it like his 1954 Tele. :-D

Sunday's my birthday. I'm an old fuck at 24 years old. I'm getting old enough that I have to take the bull by the horns, get a better job, and get the fuck out of mom and dad's basement. I know they love me... But they don't know how to listen to me, and sometimes I feel like they don't care. The Inner Circle has been my real family. John, Keith, and Danielle are there for me all the time. If it weren't for them, I don't know what I'd do or who the fuck I'd even be. The band has become ultra important to me. I need to get a real job and a real place to live so I can prioritize my life and get some money and the band off the ground. I have to justify owning 7 electric guitars, after all. :)

And... :) We're almost done with the CD. Click on the Crash Line link to the lf you wanna see what we're all about... Well, the page is ultra shitty. LOL I did it in 10 minutes. And the MP3s are old versions of songs that I had to encode into MP3s at a shitty rate, so they sound a bit muddy. But it's just a general idea of us. :) Feel free to comment."

"event","Today's a ""wonderful"" day... It decided to kill the good mood I ended last night with... Last night (while I was semi-grumpy), Keith and Danielle invited me out to Chili's. Johnny joined us. We then went to Pub 46 and saw a HORRIBLE band called Overboard... LOL It seems that they're called that cuz they must've been thrown overboard on cruise ships for being so bad! Good for some laughs, though. As usual, Danielle asked me if her and Keith grossed me out by acting like any BF/GF should act. My answer is no. They have every right to be the way they are, and if anybody tells them otherwise, I'll kick them in the nuts. Couples should be cute with each other. If they aren't, there's problems. I'm happy for them. :) No probs!

Now comes today... Woke up OK. Lots of sleep. No call from work about last night's death of the creditcard machine and it's subsequent fix. Landlord comes over. Dickface wants us out by February 15th cuz his knob gobbling son wants the house. We're 7 people in this house. It's hard to find a house for this many people in this area (since 9/11) that won't require my mother to get a job, my father to get a second job, and my brother David and I to pay crazy rent. So... My mother's on the rampage of telling me that I don't look for a job (which after two years of searching, I'm convinced I'm royally fucked and stuck where I am unless I get the band off the ground), and bitching at everybody and cursing her head off... So, the mood of the house is GREAT!!! [sigh]

Tonight is band practice... I've gotta talk to the guys about what we're gonna do... Cuz I'm thinking that Crashline is my way out. Turn my music into a career. Get this band out playing and get some recognition for it. Buy my parents a house and make life easy for everybody... I'm convinced we can do it. Check out the Crashline link to the left and tell me what you think."

"event","Semi-blah day... Went through the motions at work. Made believe I did enough stuff to not let the boss get on my back. Paid my car insurance for the last time this year. WOO HOO! That means a possibility of getting a new guitar from work. :) A little extra money 'til January. Only one weird thing happened today to me (outside of the snow happening to everybody, and what's that abooooot?).

Guess who I see today when I go to pay my insurance? Little Miss Silence herself... Fine, I saw her. That was... whatever. But what she asked me is what bothered me. ""When you're done with that, you're coming over, right?"" WHAT!? It made my brain hurt. Why would she assume that? I haven't spoken to her since our date... Actually, avoiding her is a better word. She weirded me out THAT bad. I'm a WEIRD guy, so you have to be pretty god damn weird to get under my skin! As Joey Lawrence once said...""WHOA!!!!""

But leave it to the guys and Danielle to, as always, end my day on a high note. :) Crapplebees, half price appetizers, Nachos Nuevos! Good times, good laughs, as always. I can always count on the inner circle to keep me in good spirits and I always try to return the favor. :) John, Keith, and Danielle are very close to me, and I'll do just about anything for them. :-D"

"event","Have you guys ever been on a date that was so boring, your head hurt? That's what I just got home from... OY VEY! I like to think that I'm a easy to talk to guy and that ANYBODY could be confortable with me. You guys know I love to go into detail, but there's not much detail... I picked her up, we went to Ghettobrook Mall, went to the Great Notch Inn for a couple drinks, and I drove her home. All the while, we barely talked, and when I asked her something, I usually got a blank stare. And in the middle of the bar, she started kissing me out of the blue. It was a surreal experience... What people that do acid would call a bad trip. YIKES and GADZOOKS.

So, I'm home, exhausted, and I feel like the life force has been sucked from every cell in my body by this girl. I'm just dumbfounded by how not-there she is. I'm gonna sit here in my PJs. I'm sitting here talking to Johnny and Danielle's supposed to call me back, and being the wonderful friend and source of female wisdom that she is, she'll explain to me what the hell happened, cuz God knows I have no frickin' clue!"

"event","I had day like a sandwhich: a heaping helping of aggrivation on some happy bread.

Day started off great. Woke up early, actually chipper. Went out to lunch with Danielle and Keefer. Yum... CHILI'S! That was great. :)

Then the trouble started... Today's plan was change my spark plugs, valve cover gaskets, and oil... Valve cover gaskets were easy... Find out I don't have the tools at home to do the spark plugs, so... OK, whatever... Normally 20 minute oil change... FOUR AND A HALF HOURS!!!!! Usually it's simple... First problem... Couldn't find the tools. That took a while cuz my brother hid them in his room. Second problem... The DOUCHEBAG who did my oil change last time apparently thought it would be cool if he used an impact wrench to put the oil drain plug back in... Not only did he put it in so tight that it was nearly impossible to get it out (once I did get the ""proper"" tool), but he ROUNDED THE NUT OFF!!! So, tools that would normally fit didn't. So, there started the proverbial banging of the head... And 7 trips back and forth to Autozone. Recockulous, I tell you. ARG! So, yeah.... One of the EASIEST things you could do to a car took 4.5 hours...

Also, during this time I start realizing a partial source to my mental issues... My family bickers like Nazis as a Bar Mitzfah! It's ridiculous, and EXTREMELY negative on a constant basis. All the BS I have to put up with all day cuz simple Yes and No answers get turned into this diatribe of why we're all in hell cuz of the house we live in, or our landlord, cuz my room is dirty, or cuz my job sucks. Like ""Mom, can I use the van so I can get stuff for my car?"" ""You know your room is a pig stye!"" ""Yeah, I know, but I'm overdue on my oil change."" ""Well, why don't you worry about your room! It's embarrassing!"" ""Well, mom, a clean room doesn't get me to work, does it!?"" Yeah... that's the logic of my family. It would make Mr. Spock try to give himself the Vulcan Death Grip.

After I finally calmed down, some good happens. I start poking around online and find this girl Gina from my town in a chat room. She seems pretty nice, and sounds cute. Well, I can only hope... Sometimes I do have to be optimistic. We're supposed to meet tomorrow and go to the mall. We'll see how things actually work out. LOL Who knows with my love life. [for a complete reference to my love life, watch Clerks and pay attention to the character of Randal Graves]"

"event","Interesting day for Crashline. Went to the studio without our drummer (my brother, David). He's sick (BOO HOO!). Blah. I'd go to the studio sick and still rip out some sick riffs. All in all, we got some work done, but not the work we really wanted to get done. A couple songs that we're really jonesin' to get out are still unfinished works that we need to do from scratch. I'm not quite sure I'm happy with the solos I did today, but we'll see what happens when we go back in two weeks, WITH A DRUMMER (I hope...).

Also... Smoothed over the problem with the friend I pissed off... Finally got a heavy weight off my chest with that one. When I befriend somebody, I never want them to be sad or angry, and it VERY MUCH goes against that when I'm the source of those feelings... So, I'm happy, now, and we went out to play some pool tonight. GOD, I sucked tonight. LOL

Also... Lemme ask this... Why is it that every time a girl likes me, she's far away from me, not somebody I'm really attracted to, illegal, or psychotic and obsessive (or any combination thereof)? I've got this girl who lives quite a bit away from me who I really have no idea what she really looks like and she was crying last night online that I wouldn't call her at 1:30am, after I had worked an 11 hour day on three and a half hours sleep. ""I can't go to sleep unless I hear you voice!"" Jesus Christ!!! We talked once!!! ONCE! I'll admit, I attach VERY easilly and can be QUITE the pain in the butt, but I've never told anybody THAT after talking on the phone ONCE. I've never even felt like that. The closest I've ever gotten to something like that was calling the girl a few times in the middle of the day when I knew she was busy (cuz I was a HUGE idiot). I admit my faults and I try my best to make up for them... So, why do I get this kharmic kickback of what I do tenfold anyhow???"

I'm tired... So tired... Of having work! Work 11 hours, make peanuts, and it cuts into my weekend. Went out last night, had a blast. Watched Johnny get himself some and reclaim the JB Hump'n'stuff moniker. :-D Good night last night, paid for it today... Came home, got bombarded with phone calls. Got invited out by Keefer, Danielle, and Nikki, but nobody had a clue what to do, and I wanted to eat, and I'm really in a PJ mood... So... PJs, Sunkist, and cold Shells & Cheese. Yum. LOL And then Ashwee invited me to make my own journal. 

I've never been the journal type, but I thought ""Why not?"". Besides... It could be theraputic by letting me vent. I've had a lot of lot of emotional stress I've been taking out on the wrong people lately... People I love are mad at me, and it's cuz I don't know how to properly let things go and I can become way too much. I become a nusance. And the sad thing is, I realize this, and I can't help myself from constantly calling somebody and most of the time I don't even realize I do it. I'll look at my call log at the end of the night and I'm like ""I don't remember using the phone this much!"" I need to learn how to do things differently and not piss off people who have gone out of their way to make me smile and bring me happiness.

I think what's been bothering me the most is that my ""sister"" is leaving... Jenn has been my best friend and practically family for well over a year... And she's moving to Oregon. I don't feel she's going out there with a plan. I worry about her, and I don't wanna come across as being her dad... I'm very conflicted... And I think one reason I've pissed somebody else off is because I'm trying to fulfill my sense of loss with Jenn with her. 

Well, now concludes Part I of the psychoanalysis of Tom. Stay tuned for more odd babbling from me."

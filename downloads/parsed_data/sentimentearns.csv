"event","<p dir=""ltr"" style=""MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"" align=""left""><font size=""3"">Prepare yourself. This is an epic dream. It consists of four parts, each a continuation of the last, with me waking up in between each part. Each part is a dream cliche, but each with its own twist; Part I is about sex, Part II is about family, Part III is about the musical The Wiz - this isn't a typical dream cliche, but it is for me, and I suppose it being about theatre/stage/acting makes it somewhat cliche (could I really beat that dead horse any longer? How many dreams have I had about The freaking Wiz?!) and Part IV was a lucid dream about my teeth falling out. <br /><br />For the record, the only substance I was using last night was the teeniest tiniest bit of alcohol, and that was long before I had this dream (in the early to late morning). No illicit drugs were used in the making of this dream. <br /><br />Part I: <br /><br />This dream is the least vivid of the four. I was in my bedroom (in my apartment) at night. I was with who I thought was one of my coworkers, but her face was vague; it could very well have been anyone. All I know for sure is that she was Latina. We were eating those chocolates with liquor in them, and we had tons of them, and we were getting tipsy. I had my lights turned off and my nightlight turned on, like I do for sexytime, and in some way, me and this Latina girl were getting frisky, though it wasn't arousing, it was just mechanical. We were making out and we both sat down on my bed, and she went to give me oral sex. Right as she put her mouth on me, she vomited all over me and my bed. I was grossed out and I ran into the bathroom to clean myself up. She got some paper towels and started cleaning off my bed, and it cleaned relatively easily. After it was cleaned up I said to her, ""I didn't think you were that drunk!"" and she said, ""I wasn't."" From that, I almost got the impression that she vomited on me on purpose, though I'm not sure why. <br /><br />Part II: <br /><br />I was in my house, hanging out with my parents, Alison (my sister) and Rich (my brother-in-law) and my niece and nephew. I was drinking kombucha tea and feeling the euphoria that goes along with it, and in fact all of us were in good moods, laughing and getting along. My parents somehow found my sex toys and seemed disappointed about it. In my state I said to them, ""Oh come on, you know you use them. You're human, we all need a little self-love now and then."" Somehow they agreed, and all of a sudden I started spilling details of my sex life to them and Alison and Rich. I started telling them about this one bi-curious stint that I'd had in my apartment, the girl and I were drunk off booze-chocolates and she barfed all over me and my bed (this was the connection to the Part I). They all thought that this was the funniest thing they'd ever heard. Rich started doing this utterly ridiculous dance that involved disco dancing and pelvic thrusts. Repeating it makes it sound like we were all highly drunk, but we really weren't, we were just in a lighthearted state of euphoria, enjoying each other's company. Throughout Part II we were preparing to go on a big long road trip. We were packing suitcases, loading up various cars, etc. Right before we were about to leave I thought to ask, ""Hey, um, yeah, where are we going?"" They all replied, ""Why, we're off to see The Wizard, of course!"" Which leads me to... <br /><br />Part III: <br /><br />I was at my college and somehow I had auditioned for a theatre show, the show of course being The Wiz by Charlie Smalls. Why I would audition for that show again, after being in it once already in high school and not exactly having the best time with it, is beyond me. Anyway, the stage we were performing on was typical of a dream, ie, the biggest damn stage you've ever seen in your entire life, and the house is so vague it very well may not have even been there. As all my dreams, if not overtly sexual, must have sexual undertones, we were all dressed very scantily. People from both high school and college theatre were performing, as well as people I had never seen before, and the company was so huge there must have been at least a hundred, if not more in it. The only one who wasn't there was Nathan, oddly enough, and I remember being totally okay with not seeing him. We were at a dress rehearsal of the show, and everything was going surprisingly well considering the sheer amount of discipline it takes to keep a company that size on track. The show was, for the most part, interpretive. There was very little in it that was literal, including scenery and costumes. The set was basically a giant forest, I believe with real trees, and there was no Emerald City. The costumes were also figurative, but they made no sense. Everyone wore ripped-up shreds of clothing in various colors (mine was grey), there was no Scarecrow, Tinman or Lion costumes, and Dorothy had no silver slippers. I was playing a supernumerary, with no discernable lines or importance to speak of, and I had to learn all the group numbers and all the songs. I also did trapeze-like work on the proscenium arch of the stage, which involved climbing up on top of the proscenium and writhing around in some sort of suggestive dance during the song ""She's the Wiz."" I remember during that part of the show I would look down and be afraid of the height. I don't know who anyone in our cast was, except that Heather Gearhart(?!?) was playing the Tinman (though presumably Loren was playing The Wiz, just like in high school). During the Tinman's song ""What Would I Do if I Could Feel,"" I remember being on stage in my shredded grey dress, while the Tinman sang about how much it sucks being made of tin while wearing this shredded black dress. It really made no sense. Another song that I remember performing during the show was ""Give It To Me Baby"" by Rick James. The way my brother-in-law danced during Part II of the dream was how we danced to this song. The show was stressful but in its own way enjoyable. <br /><br />Part IV: <br /><br />It was after dress rehearsal of The Wiz, and the entire company was sitting in the now-visible huge house of the huge theatre listening to the director give us a run-down (I want to say that Lissa was directing). Suddenly we were all in costumes and makeup actually appropriate for the show. I was sitting next to Clair and the now-present Nathan, chit-chatting. Clair was in the Dorothy costume and Nathan was in the Scarecrow costume (these costumes were identical to the ones used when we did the show in high school). I'm not sure what costume I was in. Out of nowhere I started licking my teeth, and noticed that two of them were dangerously loose. I was wiggling them with my tongue, Nathan and Clair were like, ""Ew that's gross,"" then I was like, ""I seriously think these are about to come out,"" then bam, the first pointy tooth on the left side popped out and into my hand. It started bleeding, I could taste it, and I freaked out. I leaped out of my seat, ran to the front of the house where the director was sitting, and I was like, ""AGHHHHHHH my pointy tooth just fell out!!!"" And the director said something to the effect of, ""What do you want me to do about it?"" I started wiggling my fake tooth (the one directly to the right of the one that had just fallen out), and it was loose too. I said, ""I think this one is about to come out -- "" then it also popped out into my hand. This one didn't bleed as much. Again I spazzed, and holding both my teeth in my right hand I ran out of the theatre yelling with my arms flailing wildly in the air. Nathan happened to be outside (the details of ""outside"" are rather odd but I don't remember them vividly. Presumably this was the lobby of the theatre) and I said to him, ""OMG Nathan my teeth just fell out, what should I do?!?!"" He had nothing to offer so he walked away. Here is where the dream starts to get weird. In my spaz-attack I fell down on my knees, then it finally dawned on me: ""I'm dreaming,"" I said out loud, ""I'm dreaming. It's just a dream."" I ran over to Clair, who was also in this lobby and standing next to this random big whale tank just sitting in the middle of the damn lobby. ""Guess what Clair?! I'm dreaming. This is just a dream, my teeth didn't really fall out."" She said, ""Well that's nice,"" then all of a sudden the dream turned into a cartoon. I don't think I've ever had that happen before. I rode on a cartoon magic carpet with a blonde Jasmine (yes, from the movie Aladdin) and we landed in the middle of a field. There were big oranges and lemons growing in this field, and we dressed them up in little baby clothes. Jasmine said, ""I don't know what to name them. It's between Orange and Lemon."" I said, ""I'll make it easy for you. Name the lemon Lemon and name the orange Orange."" She said, ""Oh, yay, you're smart!"" <br /><br />There you have it.

"event","<font size=""3"">11/4/03 - This next dream is so funny. Be prepared, it's incredible. <br /><br />I was like 10 in this dream, I don't know why. I was with my smart cousin; she was like 12 in this dream. I was also with my parents and my aunt and uncle. We were just hanging out at my house and talking and joking around like we always do, and somehow we get to talking about superstitions. My cousin was like, ""I don't believe in superstitions. The only superstition I believe in is 'Every time a door opens in the US, a toilet flushes in Afghanistan.'"" Everyone in my family was cracking up, I was cracking up in my dream, I woke up mid-laugh, it was great. And I thought of that MYSELF and it was in MY dream; I'm so proud of myself. Most of the people that I told today thought it was funny too. <br /><br />I mean, that's just the greatest quote ever, isn't it? I'm gonna make it my new motto...well, sure it doesn't make sense er anything, but I think that's the point; it's not supposed to make sense, and that's the genius in it.</font>"

"event","Yeah so I was bored and decided to look at some websites...  I started at Penn & Teller's website, where I read a little about their show from last season regarding PeTA...  for those of you who don't know, PeTA is an organization who believes that killing people is ok if it will save a few animals...  Yes that's right they support directly and indirectly people who have no compunction about using terrorism to get their point across...

Your brother or sister, or parents could be going to work one day only to find the place burned to the ground, attacked, trashed, or they could even be KILLED by these whackos...  ethical treatment my ass.

So because I was bored I went to their website...  and guess what!  They had fucking ANDY DICK with a recorded message talking about how some stupid ass store at the mall has rabbit fur in their clothes...  what the fuck?  Rabbit fur?  Who gives a shit...  then they graphically describe how the poor widdle bunnies can't hop and play for their whole widdle lives...  we'll convienently forget that in the real world these bunnies don't really get to do that... in fact, the wild rabbits that are out there live their lives in constant fear of just about EVERYTHING else (they're prey animals, DUH!)  and that they don't get to hop and play, they run from one cover to the next stopping to eat a little on the way, then run at the slightest sign of movement...  but anyway, the rabbits are humanely killed (quite quickly and painlessly actually they have their skulls cracked or neck broken...  anyone who's ever studied rabbits know that they die instantly at this point, they are prey animals remember??  when something like this happens their body functions cease so they don't die in pain while being EATEN) then they are hung up and have their blood drained so they can be used for meat and fur and nothing wasted... (jeez these imperialist bastards don't even have the common indecency to waste most of the body parts!!)

Needless to say, I am pissed... why?  Because Andy Dick is a fucktard, ""The Used"" are shit for brains as well... and in fact anyone who supports PeTA's new dumbass policy is too...  It cracks me the hell up how we have these self-righteous hollywood and music MORONS who think that because they know how to play a guitar, or tell a joke, or act that their fucking opinions should mean more than any of ours...  Look at that fucking show Trippin on MTV (check out the article, ""I hate Cameron Diaz"" on maddox.xmission.com for his opinion Maddox says it way better than I ever could, so I won't even try).  I am fucking fed up with these people...  from here on out, any fucking band or actress who trys to tell me how to think because they are morons, I will stop patronizing...  (ok well Andy Dick was never funny anyway, so no loss there)

I hate Hollywood."

"event","So I was reading some of my old posts from my old blog... u know, the one I used to write in daily before the weight of the world dragged my soul down and beat it into bloody submission...

But some of my posts were very insightful and awesome...  what can I say I kick ass.  People should love me... and if they are hot chicks they should want to throw their naked bodies at me!  So if you are a hot chick, I am waiting.

In other news, well... that is all the news you get right now... me kicking ass should be enough you whiny greedy bastards.  Shit.

Please note my mood... I am feeling PREDATORY.  That means I want to hunt some prey animals and kill with my massive manly bare hands.  Damn... I kick ass."

"event","yeah... so since I've already been yelled at (on here and off) for liking boobies and going to strip clubs, I have decided that I am gonna add hot internet chicks to my LJ.  Why?  Because I like hot internet chicks... especially ones who look like fetishxfairy...  have you seen her page??  I dunno what it is but, yow.  hot.

anyway, this has nothing to do with me being yelled at, but since it's 4am here I don't think that it matters that much... in the morning I am sure I will care...  actually probably not.

So... yeah."

"event","So last night I get home, thinking, cool I will get online check e-mails get a few things done, and life will be good...

Then when I sat down there is a strange program installed on my computer.  What the fuck is this?  Well after much work and effort I figure that its probably the aftereffect of a fucking torjan horse virus, and that someone has been wandering around in my computer (this doesn't really bother me much, because my porn is all the you can find this on the web pretty easy type or porn.)  But its the fact that my computer is less secure than I hoped it was.

If you are on aol and use McAfee, it sucks.  If you are on AOL because they promise free McAfee then you are a moron.

I am installing norton antivirus as we speak, and it has already found twice as much stuff as mcafee did, AND I've already used mcafee to clean the shit out.

Fucking AOL.

I want a safer internet my ass...  Like all of a sudden AOL is the internet, or like they have any say about what the fuck I put on MY webpage.  Sure they can block me, but I'm not paying someone to decide for me what I can look at or not.  If I want hate propoganda, hard core porn, or women having sex with dobermans I should be allowed to get that...

Sigh."

I am really horny tonight, partly because the wife won't put out, partly because I see the hot chick in class all day.  Pretty sad huh??  She is extremely bangable, and had great legs and an awesome atitude about life the universe and everything....  SIIGH.

I might go to the strip club tomorrow night.  They have twins featuring!  TWINS!  rock on."

"event","You know... as I watched TV tonight and last night I noticed a whole hell of a lot of commercials with fucking children in them.  Now... if its a commercial for baby food, or diapers, fine.  But these are commercials for car insurance and shit...  How is that supposed to get me interested in those products?  Do they figure that I'll say, ""Awww the kids are cute!  I need car insurance that cute kids like!""  That's totally retarded, why?  Because children aren't cute.  Children are obnoxious, noisy, and smell bad.  In general kids should have their asses kicked every day just so they know their place.  Seriously.  I hate them...  more than I hate kids, I hate the people who spawn then then don't kick their asses and keep them in line.  Really, ever been to the super-fuck-market and have a screaming kid in your asile and no parent there to shut them the fuck up?  Or better, at the movies, or in a restaurant, or on a plane, where you can't just get up and leave, but rather the parent forces you to endure their pain for 2 hours because they can't backhand the kid and shut them the hell up?

No, I don't get it.  Children in commercials, no.  Hot chicks that are naked?  At least you'll have me watching the commercial instead of saying, ""WHAT THE FUCK!"""

"event","SO I have a dentist appointment tomorrow... I am really not looking forward to it because I think I've got at least 2 cavities (I always have them, regardless of how much I brush and floss)  sucks huh?

But at least then the intermittent pains in my mouth should be gone (hopefully).  I was in New Orleans all last week and it kinda blows to be back to the real world...  my wife is driving me nuts already (same old shit, I tell her something which she ignores, then she gets mad later because what I warned her about actually happens...)

I will also point out that the sexual frustration caused by a woman I know hasn't alleviated since I've been seperated from her... shit what can I say, she's hot, she's an ex-stripper, and she's damn cool to hang out with.  She's funny as hell when drunk (though you have to babysit her some).  Either way, I'd bang her lol.

So yeah...  thats it for today lol"

"event","SO last night I ordered a new digital camera... it should be good... either way it shows how much of a geek I can be, because for decisions like this I usually do research, imagine what I do before I do something like start smoking cigars!  I researched the hell out of that crap, and now I smoke.  Anyway soon I should have pornographic pictures to post on here, any ladies out there wanna get naked for a complete stranger's webpage?  Didn't think so....  anyway if you wanna lemme know.  Boobies are always accepted."

"event","I think I am officially giving up on my best friend.  It just doesn't seem to work.  She lives like an hour away and has made absolutely ZERO effort on the friendship in almost a year.  I invite her up and she doesn't get back to me.  We make plans to take a trip somewhere and she sits on the fence about whether she is going or not until it is too late for her to go (and still never officially tells me that she's not interested).  Honestly, its pissing me off.  I am starting to feel like a convienence friend, not her best friend.

People have told me to tell her what I am feeling, or to do other things to let her know, but the problem is, if I inform her that I am feeling forgotten about, then I feel like I am guilting her into trying harder, and I don't want guilt.  Am I weird for trying to keep good friendships going??  Or for wanting to maintain a relationship with someone who's outside my immediately local area??

The same thing has happened with my other friends from college, its really rather dissappointing...  I try to invite them places, I try to keep in touch, and there is no reciprocal action on their part... its actually extremely depressing... these are the people whom I spend nearly every waking minute with just a few years ago and now, because we're more than 5 minutes apart, nothing.

I suppose I should be about making new friends, but then the issue raises, how do you do that?!  When I was in highschool, people just had mutual interests and we'd get togther to do that stuff, college same thing...  now that I am out of school I've grown rusty, and I feel really weird walking up to a near complete stranger and asking, Hey do you like so and so??  I like going out partying and stuff, but I don't think I could make a good friendship with someone based solely on our ability to drink togther.  I need to find someone who I can sit back with, tell my deepest darkest secrets to and feel at ease with...  yeah I am married, but some stuff you just don't tell your wife... like there is a girl I know who I would love to get naked with lol...

I guess I am self consious because I've been forgotten about, screwed over, or outright discriminated against by so many people, that I don't trust people to be my friend anymore...  Sigh."

"event","Well this is it... my new LJ.  I am not a blogging virgin if that is what you're wondering, but I need to have a more private place to put this stuff in public... a place where my name isn't necessairily attached, and a place where people who know me don't necessairily have access.  Kinda strange? yeah  but you know how it is if you've blogged.  Your best friend reads something you posted and bam you're in trouble... or better, you post something sensitive and work fires you (never happened to me).  All in all though I just need a place to vent some spleen about shit that bothers me.  If some of you folks out there wanna comment so much the better.  So hi everybody!  Hope this shit won't bore you nosey bastards to tears lol :)"

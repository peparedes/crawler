"event","I didn't bother buying tickets to KCON France. I considered it over the weeks but then I thought no.

<lj-cut text=""why not"">

Well given my not so pleasant experiences previously I'm giving it a miss.  Japan Expo 2007 in Paris...and I'll leave it at that.  You can search up on old posts regarding this.  I also have to deal with shitty colleagues who want to book time off too so that fucks up my work.

It was tempting to buy a ticket because it's sort of near but I knew they would sell out fast even with the release of extra seats today.  If I was truly desperate I'd only have gone for Bangtan (because they have done things to over the months since my issues in 2014) and maybe FT Island but then I was so focused on trying for GOT7's Fly tour over in Asia and America which obviously isn't going to happen.  

Considering SM are just not in my reach and I boycotted the company because of fandoms and just how things went to hell...soz SHINee.  Liked you in the past though I've just drifted from the fandom.  Soz again (soz to you too EXO!OT9 I can't keep up with you or even China Line).  I am tempted to sell some of my BIGBANG stuff since I'm not really focusing on them or YG artists as much any more.  My energy has gone for them.

I just have to wait <strike>till I die</strike> till I can get my chance on Bangtan.  I do want them to have a long break and get their energy back once their current Asia tour to conclude Hwa Yeon Yong Hwa saga.  They're getting a lot of schedules and the fandom shit going on is not making things any nice.  They just can't win...why does this sound like EXO!OT12 deja vu days?

B.A.P I could've bought a VIP ticket to get the hi-touch in London but then I realised it would finish fucking late and I cannot afford to miss my train, be shit on for going past a typical curfew because I went to a concert by myself as I normally do 90% of the time in my gig-going experience over the past decade.  This would've been an epic birthday treat to myself but I'm just going to mourn my fangirl calamity <b>yet again</b>.

I'd say another big reason I sacrificed KCON Paris and refunded my X Japan ticket was because I want to be in a concert where I'm not surrounded by Ang Mo as much.  I need to be in familiar territory, even though most of the fellow yellows would think I'm weird or nowhere near as cool as the gwei lo/hak gwei etc, etc.  

So I'll have to wait or just give up being a fangirl who will never ever set foot in a concert in Asia, who will never get so-called tete a tete with the big faves.  This GOTBANGTAN thing is taking me deeper underground.  It's close to GOTBANGTANDAY.  Give me a few more months.

Let's hope I get some 'solace' from MYNAME in September.</lj-cut>

The trilogy to the Most Beautiful Moment In Life draws to a close with Bangtan Sonyeondan's latest album.  

<lj-cut text=""quick review"">

This will be a quick review as a lot of the songs have been featured on the previous mini albums.  Hwa Yang Yeon Hwa part 1 can be read <a href=""http://vash-chan.dreamwidth.org/1013612.html"" target=""_blank"">here</a> [<a href=""http://vash-chan.livejournal.com/1019727.html"" target=""_blank"">LJ Link</a>].  Hwa Yang Yeon Hwa part 2 can be read <a href=""https://vash-chan.dreamwidth.org/1032341.html"" target=""_blank"">here</a> [<a href=""http://vash-chan.livejournal.com/1038478.html"" target=""_blank"">LJ Link</a>]

In some way, this is a compilation album of the Hwa Yang Yeon Hwa saga, along with three new songs and remixes of previous tracks.  The new songs include the epilogue track on the first disk called ""Young Forever"" , fierce title track ""Fire"" and ""Save Me"".   There are remixes of I NEED U, Run and Butterfly.  What's a huge delight with this compilation album is the the prologue mix of ""Butterfly"" plus the extended version of ""Love Is Not Over"" and ""House Of Cards."" Both these songs were undoubtedly the highlight of my HYYH listening as they let Vocal Line show what they're made of and the prologue mix of Butterfly was breathtaking that I was originally disappointed that it didn't land itself on the albums at all.  Thankfully it made its appearance on the Young Forever album.  

The first verses in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbvE0FV_70U"" target=""_blank"">Young Forever</a> is a tug to the heart as it fittingly describes the end of a performance and how you wonder whether the audience liked it or whether you as the performer made mistakes throughout.  The song's content is self-explanatory as it does talk about wanting to keep chasing your dream and feeling young forever.  No matter how much you fall, you still pursue your dream.  

<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ujQOR2DMFM"" target=""_blank"">Fire</a> is definitely a follow-up to Dope in terms of choreography and song style (and how fitting that it was the same choreographer for both these songs).    While there is no specific story, ""Fire"" is a potential party track that'll get everyone crazy in the pit and encouraging everyone to quite literally burn/let go.  I can imagine the ARMYs in the standing area just letting go of their emotions as they listen to this song.    Kudos to Keone Madrid for the choreography.  Check out the dance version of this MV <a href=""https://youtu.be/2cTZTqBU1Rc"" target=""_target"">here</a>.

""Save Me"" is a sweet dance track.  The lines <i>Give me your hand save me save me.  I need your love before I fall, fall</i> really says it all.  I also rather like Namjoon's rap part which talks about how they are thankful for the person for letting them be themselves, helping them fly...in other words a lot of positive feelings they never had to begin with.  Honestly if I found a kindred spirit/spirit animal who gave me this kind of aura I wouldn't want to let that person go either.

This saga has been a wonderful journey and I think Young Forever is a perfect way to close this chapter.  I cried, I smiled, I swooned, I let loose when I had the freedom...each album gave me these emotions.  While I did not 100% familiarise myself with each member from predebut and the very essence of their debut era -having gotten into their music rather late in 2014- I am grateful to have sat down and listen to what this group offered over the past year.    

What will Bangtan Sonyeondan bring in their next albums? We shall see.</lj-cut>

"event","Well I'm starving after watching the BBQ episode.

<lj-cut>

- I liked the talk about the trainee days and everyone thanking a particular member for helping them get through the times

- Jackson and Jinyoung feeding each other food by overlapping their arms across :)

- I was not expecting the other members to show up.  Thought it would be a Jackson/Jinyoung <strike>romance</strike> focus during the BBQ scene.

- When everyone was eating, it got really fun :)

- Was too hungry to look at the guys properly

- The feeding relay at the end of the episode haha

- Jinyoung's motherly-ness... T_T 

</lj-cut>

I'll hopefully be able to watch this as it comes and maybe catch up on Real GOT7.</lj-cut>

After a quiet period for a few months, DAY6 return with a new a second mini album.

<lj-cut>

Opening the mini album is <b>First Time</b>, a song that talks about the lead-up to a relationship ending and that goodbye is goodbye.  The guy has boldly moved on.  The song's harmonizing section here makes me think Electric Light Orchestra.

Really like the opening riffs in <b>Blood</b>. Starts slow, builds up and then the music gets livelier and reminds me of ""Like That Sun"" from the band's debut EP.  The song talks about an angry, aggressive girlfriend and the intensity she brings to her boyfriend.    

<b>Letting Go</b> The harmonizing at the beginning of the song smoothly leads into a rather emotionally driven rock ballad about letting go of your special person.  YoungK's rapping wasn't really needed in this song but it didn't detract the listening by a huge level and everything else was still enjoyable. Ignoring this little peeve, ""Letting Go"" in general is quite a fitting title track for the band's comeback.  With echoes of a possible reference to former member Junhyeok (or you could indirectly think of it from his POV), the lyrics fit the situation well. 

<b>Sing Me</b> is a pop rock track about a guy telling his girl to not forget him so he will last long in memory.  He'll wait for her.  I chuckled over the brief mention of one of their JYP seniors ""Miss A"" during YoungK's rap.  

<b>Hope/I Wish</b> Another lively pop rock tune to bop your head to, if not one of the more rock-driven songs to feast your ears on with guitar solos.  This is a song on how we often wish to be happier in life.

Finishing up the mini album, <b>Hunt</b> kicks off with a slight doo-woop song that leads into a jive-beating tune.  The song is about a guy chasing a girl.  Perfect for the jazz dance floor and to get your dancing shoes on. 

<b><u>Overall:</b></u> 

Despite the departure of one member so early into their debut months (Junhyeok, take care and all the best to you) , DAY6 don't hold back and return with more pop-rock worthy songs that you could indulge or jig to, following their enjoyable debut album last September with ""The Day."" I am still excited to see what other musical creations they present to us over the next few months.</lj-cut>

Following on from ther successful mini album ""MAD"", GOT7 return with a new mini album. Here is a quick review. 

<lj-cut>

<b>Fly</b> is the title track for this comeback and there is a lot of rap focus here. Not necessarily from rap line but also some fusion of rap/singing from the vocalists.  Fly talks about finding comfort in each other and flying away together.  Fly away in happiness.  

<b>Can't</b> Written by Junior with rap created by Mark.  ""Can't"" is about a girl who sees right through the boy singing about his feelings towards her.  While everyone wants perfection, she can go deeper into his soul, which is embarrassing and awkward.  Sweet track. It's often a surprise to my ears whenever BamBam raps in a lower note much like how he did in Just Right.  It's a random unexpected moment.

<b>See The Light</b> A song composed by Mark which talks about how the guy likes a specific girl for how simple she is dressed in casual clothes and also shines brightly.  It's a touching song though there is mention of slight jealously when other guys are looking at this pretty girl and GOT7 only want her to look at them.  

<b>FISH</b> In this JB composed song, a relationship that has no communication and simple love feelings is in the form of a fish tank.  Why is this popular girl paying attention to the other guys swooning over her? The boyfriend wants her to pay attention to him instead. 

<b>REWIND</b> Seductive track composed by Choi Youngjae.  A very funky tune which talks about the guys checking an attractive girl out and wanting to rewind the moment he looks at her before she walks away.

<b>Beggin On My Knees</b> Written by <b>DAY6</b>'s <b>YoungK</b>, this is another funky pop rock track on the mini album.  The song talks about a guy wanting more from his girl but she steps back or pulls him when he's tired.  A see-saw relationship is in the works.  It comes to a point where the guy almost has to literally beg on his knees to get her to accept him.  It's more than a give and take situation.  Is the girl paying that much attention to him?

<b>Something Good</b> A happy song by JB to describe a super sweet relationship.  It's inevitable for the listener to smile from start to finish.  Do not resist GOT7 fluff.  

<b>Home Run</b> == the next title track that will be released in April.  Another JB composition.  <b>UPDATE 08-05-2016</b> A very cute song about a boy trying to win the affections of a girl.  Given the title of the song, you can easily imagine this all taking place during a game.  The girl is a cheerleader on the pitch and if the guy does not get the girl after the strike it's all over.

<b><u>Overall:</b></u>

Flight Log: Departure has more compositions by the members themselves compared to the previous albums and it's good to see the group have more creative opportunity to show what they can do with composing and producing their own songs.  The previous mini album MAD brought a mature sound from GOT7, giving them an edgier sound, perhaps more daring.  Does Flight Log Departure do the same? Almost.  Compared to MAD, this is another concept that feels safe and not overdoing it with excess eroticism or sugary sweetness.  It's got a good blend of tunes.  What will Home Run bring for the listeners? We can only wait.</lj-cut>

"event","Fansite orders wow I've been a busy bee...hopefully my income will cover everything.  I've donated, sent messages of support, sent videos etc...too bad my own project didn't go anywhere.  FML.

And now I have to count potential concert tickets which sucks.  

<lj-cut text=""the dilemma"">

So I still don't know if I'll go see B.A.P when they return to LDN.  It's in a venue I've never been to before.  SE LDN isn't really my area of expertise.   I sacrificed not going to see the guys when they came in April 2014, snuck in early to film Who Are You, What Are You Doing prior to their Live On Earth LDN stop.  Because of the venue in the same area as their upcoming concert GDI...ugh.  I can't really complain now since I work in East London >_>

Then that shit happened with TS...and now they're back...and now they're touring worldwide again.  Do you know what's even more cracktastic about their return? It's during bday week.  How fucked is that?

It's on Friday 13th FFS.  I don't know what to do.  Should I splash out on VIP? Should I go see them in SG instead? Should I actually save up for GOT7 in SG or America? I would rather use my annual leave on these things than my cousin's wedding because I give little care for her for many reasons.  

If I could see Fangdan live...meet them too...yeah...add that to my never going to see the light because I'm an unlucky fan list.  WYF, HZT, Yoshiki, X Japan...we're not meant to be obviously.  Let's be real I knew X DAY was going to be messed up and I was initially pissed with the favouritism overseas fans who were not from UK were getting with flight packages.  Then I saw the FB notification by Yoshiki about X DAY being cancelled and moved to next March. Was I surprised? Not really.  When it comes to being an X fan, don't expect much.  In fact don't expect much at all when you're fangirling something hard.  It's dangerous. OTOH thank goodness I got my ticket refunded when I made an enquiry to Ticketmaster.  I didn't want to wait till my ticket arrived in the post to send it back to the Manchester office.

Pata's health condition was unfortunate timing and having to reschedule the concert till next year was inevitable.  But do you know what's even messy? You could've released the new album by now.  I know shit is on both the fans and the band.  We're all just unlucky...though I'm close to giving up.  I've rooted for you, Yoshiki.  I've stood by you even when you went on a random rampage on your SNS.  

<strike>*spilling tea moment* Do you know how many people I've had to drop from my mutuals within RL and fangirling world because that bond, that trust is gone when they break it - though that's mostly for people I know IRL?! Humans D:</strike>

Yeah I still like Jrock when it appeals but the fire isn't the same.  I just feel the Western/Ang Mo fans are what he focuses on.  I hope Pata gets well soon and I hope I'll see the X Japan documentary when it is released.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut>

- Youngjae saying he wants to be tanned...he hates his fair skin.  Mate.  Mate.  MATE.  OMG.  How different to the other idols who don't want to be dark.  Fair play to you, Dong Saeng.

- I should be an expat/Laowai - I'd be an extra so easily regardless of whether I'm in Asia or what.  Fucking ridiculous.  I guess JYPE couldn't afford/didn't want to go to a Western country just yet since GOT7 were still fresh rookies a few months ago.  IDK.  

- Youngjae and Bambam playing with the stray cats :)

- The visit to Chinatown...yes I won't lie but I wished Jackson or Mark mingled with the locals and spoke either Mandarin or Cantonese.

- The photoshoots were glorious in general

- MarkBum...why was I slow in not noticing this? The subtlety

- Jinyoung's facial wash tip...I need to make an effort with the yolk and whitening separation.  I do use cleaning foam from Clinique's antiblemish collection atm.

- Really liked the JJJ Project interview haha.  The contrast with that and how quieter the other guys were in the separate interview. But it was still cute overall.

- I had no idea JB wrote Bad Behaviour.  No wonder I got all ooh ahh when I first heard it ;) 

- Everyone pointing out how very hot Malaysia is.  Yes I feel you.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""for the video"">

<lj-embed id=""669""/>

Spotted Brooklyn Beckham sitting down and heard a Hallyu actor/model named Lee Jong Suk was a guest too (UKP covered this on their website.  Lee Jong Suk appears at 6mins) .  I have no idea who this guy is since I'm so behind with Hallyu activities in general but he arrived in London a few days prior to the show, earlier than WYF did.

WYF himself shows up around 8:10 and 15 mins into the show.  I need to check Vogue China Wechat for the photos he posted.

Yay there are other fellow East Asian male faces on the runway.  I don't know your names yet but I'll research.</lj-cut>

I have done a hi-touch with Yoshiki but I was given no chance to say what I wanted to say and I don't think he was paying me much attention because I was just an Asian face to him. 

As for people I've not met yet...

- Wu Yifan -- do I need to go on why? I just want to say how much I owe him.  He did prompt me to write a big editorial on what he's done for my ethnic identity after all.  You'd think my Korean Kpop biases would do that job but no.

- GOT7 and Bangtan Sonyeondan -- I need to be fed.  This new Ahgase and ARMY/Bangtan Noona experience is making me crazy.  If I could meet BTS I'd tell them how much they inspire me and how much I wish I was young or their age again. GOT7 I'd also congratulate on their hard work like I would to BTS.  Their tight team work ethnic for a cross-national Asian group is something I wished for another group who have had their struggles since 2014.  But I think GOT7 seem like the kind of group who interact well with their fans.  I would probably just show my support and appreciation for their fan-service."

Bangtan Sonyeondan and JJ Project (but the rest of GOT7 will slide their way through randomly).

But omg...JB and Jinyoung it's like a volcanic eruption with this MAD comeback.  I've low-key fangirled GOT7 for a bit.  Then the MAD album hits me so hard.  I'm just shocked with this and the styling has been upped that my fangirl feelings hit the roof.  It's been the same way for Bangtan.  Whacking me hard in the face with epic tunes."

"event","Forgot to post about this back in November...<br /><br />I heard about Yoshiki flying over to London a week before the Classic Rock Roll Of Honours was due to take place at the Roundhouse in Chalk Farm.  He was invited as a guest and to perform in front of the audience.  The event was pretty much VIP so nobody could buy tickets unless you got an invite.<br /><br />Was a little irked by some Westerners's attitudes towards something being so &quot;Japanese-y&quot; or the fans being apparently crazy or weird because they like a Japanese musician.  Classic 'ugh something Asian is weird, how dare you like it' mindset.  Begone you privileged Ang Mo bitch.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""I wish we were born to be free""><br /><br />I snuck out of work just before 5pm finish time to get from East London to North West London.  The trains were a blessing. Caught the right ones on time and managed to get to Chalk Farm in less than an hour.  I waited by the entrance of Roundhouse and saw Tom Smith who arranged the supposed meet-up to get free shirts to hold up when Yoshiki arrives.  <br /><br />From what I remember, Yoshiki arrived really swiftly around 6pm [I came around 5:30pm] that I missed his limo due to the huge number of fans and pap surrounding the vehicle and only realised he came when people screamed and he went on the red carpet to let photos be taken of him.  Some random guys who were fighting to get autographs from ANYONE just went for it, as did other X fans.  I'm so fucking mad I didn't get close enough for a selca.  A further sign that X and I are not meant to be.  I've lost my energy for them.      <br /><br />Yoshiki thought he'd be nice by allowing some of the fans who were waiting for him outside at the Red Carpet to be invited.  100 lucky X fans why not? I thought.  Turns out nobody else from the public could go in and Yoshiki then tweeted much later saying fans can meet him nearby in Camden after midnight. <br /><br />After midnight?! Fuck no.  I had to go back to work the following day and a lot of people left the venue once Yoshiki went inside.  No way was I going to wait for him once the event finished and I didn't expect him to come out in a hurry if he was going to perform and network with the rock legends.  I saw a lot of people arrive at the venue.  Some I couldn't remember the names of but their faces were just so familiar.  Definitely remembered Chris Jericho aka Y2J from the WWE days.  He was going to present the Classic Rock Roll Of Honour event.  Had no idea he was an X Japan fan too, especially from the older days.<br /><br />The hardcore X fans managed to meet him at a pub near the canal.  I recognised their faces from the X Freaks forum and previous London conventions.   <br /><br />A few pics I managed to grab from that night.<br /><br />Free tshirt I got from Tom Smith of Japan Underground.  It's the cover of the Born To Be Free single [not sure if I'd wear this to X DAY tbh]<br /><br /><img src=""http://i67.tinypic.com/3142jw3.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""381"" alt="""" /><br /><br />On display at Roundhouse<br /><br /><img src=""http://i67.tinypic.com/2rh4olj.jpg"" width=""676"" height=""380"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Yoshiki signing for lucky fans near the barrier<br /><br /><img src=""http://i64.tinypic.com/2vto4xt.jpg"" width=""676"" height=""380"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Yoshiki posing for the photographers<br /><br /><img src=""http://i67.tinypic.com/zvsc3b.jpg"" width=""676"" height=""380"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Here is Yoshiki's classical performance.  Includes Bohemian Rhapsody, Without You and Art Of Life<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""658""/><br /><br />So there you have it.  Saw Yoshiki back in London for like 5 minutes.  See you in March 2016 hopefully.  Still miffed with how the European and other international fans get special upgrades or packages for the concert without offering anything for the UK fans...really now? Hope this will be changed nearer the time.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""survival is difficult"">

GOT7's If You Do from MBC Song big festival on NYE.  They did a shorter version but it started off slower and those bodyrolls...wtfh? Can we also talk about Markson's shirts? BamBam just attacked the Ahgases too.  Like BAAAAAAM (slight pun I'm sorry).  My initial favourites still remain I think.  I just feel utterly attacked by everybody's charisma and vocal performances.

Their MAMA performance was fantastic alongside the BTS collab.  And then I saw a fancam of Taehyung jamming to JYP's Uptown Funk performance at MBC Gayo Daejun 2015 with JB :D They were <b><i>so</i></b> into it.  Jimin was a bit shy awww.  I'm seriously into this Bangtan x GOT7 friendship.

Krishan meet up on the same show in China.  Well hello there.  You met in Feb 2015 and then you meet again in Dec 2015.  Chuffed AF.

Then I see Chanyeol spot WYF's ""Straight Outta Guangzhou"" poster at the airport <b>EDIT</b> actually it was a poster of Mr Six he spotted [found out <a href=""https://twitter.com/LUmydeerHAN/status/682936976450846720"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.weibo.com/1740237544/Dbf7e3ed9?from=page_1005051740237544_profile&wvr=6&mod=weibotime"" target=""_blank"">here</a>].  He was going to take a photo but got stopped by someone else.  Fuck that would've been a crazy shitstorm.  I mean, I didn't mind that ship back in the day even if yes Chanyeol is a problematic one (but all of EXO are not innocent though the culprits tend to lean towards PCY or Baek).  Anyway just small flickering moments like that do tickle the soul.  Remembering when Baekhyun accidentally said there were 12 members of the group on a radio show.  Oops, son D:

<b><i>ANYWAY</b></i>

Praising the few EXO-Ls who are still okay with the original 12 member family and don't shit on the former members' parade.  I think I'll have to sort out the EXO list I made on Twitter and chuck out the ones who hate the China Line members or specifically WYF.##</lj-cut>

- The minute you replay key scenes from series 1 to 3 and then say ""alternatively"" ... it gave me the feeling there would be a bit of a time jump.  Hence the Victorian era time.

- A suspicious giveaway while viewing was the 'virus in the data' mention.  Does that sound too modern in a Victorian era?

- The Bride is scary and spooky for sure

- Damn Watson, if someone told me my stories were terrible or boring I'd be butthurt too.  

- Lestrade and Mrs Hudson always delight and amuse

- Molly Hooper's crossdressing...I thought it was odd and then suspected.  Even Watson suspected Hooper was definitely female.

- Really fat Mycroft.  OK Mark Gatiss, how did it feel wearing the extra flesh?

- So alternative Mary was undercover for Mycroft?! I had the feeling).  Did think Moriarty at first but then backtracked. And amusing how Mycroft addressed her as Watson too.

- Going back and forth between the last scene of series i.e. in the plane and the Victoria era.  Yeah I sensed the Mind Palace

- OK there was like one cultural stereotypical scene for that time period.  When Thomas Ricoletti came out of that Chinese bar/brothel *snorts* and I saw the sign was in simplified Chinese.  Simplified Chinese did not surface till the 1950s. If this is the 19th Century...that shouldn't have arrived yet.

- Moriarty....fucking Moriarty.  Hi Andrew Scott.  I missed his grease.  

- Moriarty went into 221B while Sherlock was away...and saying his rooms smell manly...excuse you

- How Moriarty used his finger to wipe the dust off the fire place and then lick it.  DAFUQ 

- Moriarty telling Sherlock and Watson to elope in the scene on the cliff.  Well damn sir lol

- ""Miss me?"" yeah that really gave it away Moriarty

- I forget how much mind-fucking Moriarty does with Sherlock

- ""Dead is the new sexy"" [now you got me guilty of liking all those supernatural vampire tv series]

- OK so Moriarty is definitely dead according to present time Sherlock...we just have to wait to see what he plans to do/planned to do...?! Or something like that...how much longer do we have to wait, team? D:

- It's clever how near the end the Victorian!Sherlock talks about being a man out of time and the scene closes with the camera zooming out of 221B Baker Street and showing the normal, modern setting of London with the double decker bus</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""okay"">

<b>Hello - Boys Republic</b> Got inspired to go to their London concert after hearing this song and catching up with their releases since their debut.  The acoustic and Acapella versions of this song are superb.

<b>Greenhouse Girl - Wu Yifan</b> this is a cover of a classic Chinese rock song and used as the theme for Mr Six.  WYF puts in his own rap while singing the cover and it works.  Plus it's a definite redemption spin from that Bad Girl MV (the song was fine.  MV = would rather forget).

<b>So Dangerous - UP10TION</b> So catchy welp.  And that guy (Hwanhee?!) whose vocals inevitably remind me of Baekhyun and make me swoon :O but I like the dance and song.  Infectious.

<b>Luhan's solo tracks</b> Barring Lu (because while it was an experiment...I was terrified. Bless him) his solo releases have been nice.  I've missed his vocals NEGL.

<b>Tao's solo tracks</b> what I've heard so far.  Very Tao and still good.  The rapping, the singing and the very Tao sound.  I won't be able to keep up as much (I say this for everyone OTL) but I'll try.

<b>Confession Song / Stars / Sun - GOT7</b> the extra songs on the Winter repackage of MAD are such treats.  I like how Sun is wonderfully R'n'B whilst Stars and Confession Song are sweet ballads.  Confession Song is suitably festive.</lj-cut>

"event","Lost mutuals, cutting ties, losing trust in society...but there was music that still reached out to me.  Leggo.

<lj-cut text=""we on"">

<u><b>Albums which I liked but didn't make it to the ZOMG holy shit I must listen again section</b></u>

<b>Chained Up - VIXX</b> Well I definitely have my own secrets on what I'd do to VIXX when they're ""Chained Up"" and they upped the sauciness in this album.  It's like they know what Starlights want.  Cheeky.  ""Eternity"" and ""Error"" are also included on this second full length album. 

<b>Endless Forms Most Beautiful - Nightwish</b> The first album with Floor Jansen on vocals.  A very different step from the band's previous journeys into fantasy, imagination and much more however the symphonic and power metal has not been entirely lost.  This release is about the science of life and celebration of reality. There isn't much opera here although you'll get it in the last track ""The Greatest Show On Earth."" Still, Floor sounds very good. 

<b>25 - Adele</b> Still sounding fantastic since her last release and battling writer's block, Adele shows why she's good.  Thank god she didn't do a cover of Lionel Richie's ""Hello."" I'd have side-eyed her if she did.

<b>Beyond The History - HISTORY</b> Continuing their darker sound from Desire, this mini album certainly hits my buttons (Might Just Die is a guilty pleasure, as is the MV with the moment where their shirts go up) and the group still carry their funk somewhere.  I do miss their Acapella style from the early days though.

<b>EOEO - UNIQ</b> So EOEO definitely got to my head with its catchiness and ""Falling In Love"" the debut track by Yuehua's Korean-Chinese boy group eventually warmed to my ears.  EOEO MV did not help with the ridiculous body rolls.  Luv Again is another sweet track to look out for.

<b><u>The ones who hit me where it hurts</u></b>

<b>The Day - DAY6</b> I have almost jumped on the DAY6 train and they're rookies.  What the fuck? I've never followed Jae from his previous appearances on Kpop idol shows but I'm backtracking where I can and following everyone's SNS (Jae, your Twitter is nuts lol).  These guys are bringing back my dead fangirling from pop rock.  ""Congratulations"" is wonderfully passive aggressive.  I hope to see and meet them one day.  My favourite song from this debut mini album is ""Colours"" [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dASrzjg27DQ"" target=""_blank"">listen</a> here].  

<b>Matrix - B.A.P</b> Their comeback got me hyped.  ""Wild, Young & Free"" is a rock track to die for.  Hits you in the face.  Not agreeing with the caged animals and Yongguk's style of dress in one scene though the song makes up for it.  My favourite track from the mini album is undoubtedly ""Blind"".  It's like a sequel to ""Save Me"" from First Sensibility.  Slow rock ballad which punches you hard.  Welcome back guys.

<b>EXODUS / Love Me Right - EXO</b> Yes how crazy, despite how I struggle as a listener and a fan whose shattered by the departures and gaining strength again from elsewhere, EXODUS / Love Me Right are albums with awesome tunes.  El Dorado is my jam and I absolutely adore the M version.  Read my quick review for more information.

<b>MAD - GOT7</b> Somehow this specific concept has lured me into the Ahgase territory for real.  It's no longer low-key observing.  I'm falling hard like I did with Bangtan Sonyeondan at a later pace.  I'm blaming JJ Project for this though thankfully Mark Tuan my original fave and potential kindred spirit still lurks to bite back.  Sure HOTTEST will say this mature, seductive sound reminds many of old school 2PM (your guess is as good as mine, I'm still working through 2PM's discography) but If You Do has managed to give GOT7 some wins from The Show. I think that's still an accomplishment and their fanbase is growing.  MAD is such a great mini album.  I've enjoyed their previous works but this one in particular is steamy and I feel like I'm being attacked by Noona killers, which seem to change with this group.    

<b>RM mixtape - RapMonster</b> I really liked this mixtape and whatever you may think of RapMon as an idol, you can't deny he has a particular something when he gets down to rapping.  Namjoon does not hold back on the f bombs and I really hope to hear a mixtape from the other Rappers in the group too. 

<b>HwaYangYeonHwa pt 1 and 2 - Bangtan Boys</b> Finding their sound with <i>The Most Beautiful Moment In Life</i> saga...I have never been so pulled in since my early EXO!OT12 experience and old BIGBANG days.  You give me so much emotion and inspiration, Fangdan.  Is it any wonder why I've written a ton of letters for your birthdays and debut anniversaries? Read my reviews for further thoughts.</lj-cut>

Having just finished my review for HYYH pt 2 finally this song is definitely on my repeat list because it pushes my limit of emotion.  It does what a lot of rock ballads or any symphonic metal power ballads do and hit me hard.  It also hits me in the same way that B.A.P's 1004 (Angel) does <strike>well damn Baekhyun and Taehyung your groups connect unintentionally</strike>

There is a deep friendship in the cheeky video clips.  My favourites hurt me in many ways and I wonder how I chose them to be these supposed biases.  There is a ton of face time in each video and the slight slip of the jacket to show the shoulders always gets to me in the live performance.  

From the Xmas video - I want Jin's ear muffs GDI.  I want to hang out with my favourites.  I want to slap Yoongi for his subtle hot fanservice.  I just don't know...  

I don't think there is any doubt these guys did what BIGBANG failed to do and I think it is because I'm rooting from almost their debut days.  BIGBANG are established.  They got to where they were after many years so they've got a shitload of back up.  Whereas, Bangtan are growing.  EXO are going up and down because of a fuckload of scandals not necessarily including lawsuits and I can't really keep up with them.  With everyone also shading those who left...it's worsening the rift in the fandom and it infuriates me to have to see or interact with fans who do many kinds of shit within the fandom or against other people.  I can't with the deja vu of all these jinxed bands I'm into.</lj-cut>

"event","From what I managed to catch in real time.

<lj-cut>

- Am I surprised EXO and BIGBANG got the most awards? Or YG and SME in general?! Not really.  Am I sad Bangtan did not get nominated in some of the other big categories? I am indeed.  It's been a strong year for them, despite scandals.

- Bangtan winning World Performer award...I recognised the Red Bullet footage and screamed when they won.  YG and SM stans STFD.

- Lightsaber would've been massively epic if there was an actual duel (even in the MV).  OTOH I liked Call Me Baby recorded footage that then weaved itself to the live show.  

- Drop That was louder than I thought.  Nice to see Chanyeol get his rocker on and I'm happy Chen gets to do a rock vocal again but for some reason...that performance was more theatrical than I thought.  But it got everyone hyped so...what can I say? Hopefully the guys will release another rock inspired track that isn't as overboard.  

- Aside from an epic performance from another collaboration...the biggest highlight was Seungri sitting on Sehun's lap during Bae Bae.  I detested the MV and was half-listening and watching while doing my work and when I switched tabs...I saw Seungri being gentle and soothing with Sehun.  Make love not war, fandoms.  Two Maknaes from two big name groups blending...I did not see that coming.

- Taeyang was not shading the idols who had left early.  More of a dig towards the organisers.  I was wondering why the show finished later and airport photos of some people had lurked rather quickly.

- I didn't bother watching PSY's closing performance though I'm sure it was crazy.  You got Chow Yun Fat to dance with you after all.

- Chow Yun Fat is a legend.  I didn't need subtitles to understand him :O

- Jolin Tsai's Play performance...damn look at those sisters work those heels and sass.  LOL at the female fan getting caught on camera.  Her reaction was unsurprising <strike>while we're talking about cameras, why do Asian shows have to zoom up on white people randomly?</strike>.  I don't think BTS and a lot of other idols 'got it' or approved much of the performance.  Let's not go there. I felt like I was in a Kylie/Gaga/Madonna concert.  

- My favourite moment was the BTS x GOT7 team up.  Fucking rocked my socks off.  Too bad I had to watch some of it on mute during the day.  But wow I really wanted to just jump and run across the office floor. 

- GOT7's If You Do was great. After repeated watching, I did notice JB trip and almost lose his balance on the second stage due to the rising platforms hidden

- BTS's Run.  The jacket colours were great, the choreo while not as epic as their previous songs was still good.  Can we talk about the slight jacket removal to show their shoulders off? Even when not bare, damn those shoulders look good.  Jimin is hurting me with his growing handsomeness.  They all looked so hot for sure ;_;</lj-cut>

Should we blame the director?

<lj-cut text=""the no of cliches"">

Seriously, where do I begin? It's got cliches I have gotten to loathe as I get older.

- So the white girls get to pose and be pretty, be naturally seductive in the club but the so-called girlfriend is out being promiscuous behind WYF's back and hanging out with white guys and the odd Chinese man.

- WYF's being portrayed as the prick methinks.  Is his character being over-possessive or sensitive? Is this a negative stereotype of East Asian men being parodied? Am I meant to be amused? All I thought was, ""why this again?"" 

- Those braids need to DIAF Yifan.

- Why do I get little vibes of Crooked within the song and MV? [going mad, crying man tears, partying with the birds - although everything here is used to death in many MVs]. Bad Girl is not a 100% rip off which is what the haters are saying OTL

- Sucks that Instiz linked to that and Kpop fans (including that woman from Dazed mag rme) said it was lolzy and bad.  It just worsened the 'he's ugly' commentary. Yes that MV was a mess.  The song is catchy...until I realised why and how it reminded me of that GD song

OK I'm going to be lenient now...

- If this is a troll track made for the MGN and isn't official OK I'll let you off

- If I was to ignore the cultural stereotypes the entire MV can be seen as a little comedic >.>

- I liked the William Chan Wai Ting bromance.  There should've been more

- OMFG the nipple shot  

- The song caught me off guard.  Thought it would be some slow track but no it was a jumpy 'drive' tune

I hope the next official single will be a lot more decent. By all means, go gothic rock or acoustic to pierce my heart.  Justify your talent WYF dark horse and make the h8ers pay.</lj-cut>

Hearing B.A.P's mini album medley and seeing two teasers so far...I am psyched for their comeback.  I hope TS are treating you well this time.

Bangtan...as long as Butterfly is on that mini album I'm down with it.  Youthful angst that reminds me of my lack of youth...please feel free. 

GOT7's MAD mini album is almost cementing me as an IGOT7.  Why are my favourites ripping my fangirl heart? You're growing up so fast, guys.  I hope I get a decent photocard when my order arrives.

"event","So Hmart had a 10% off sale.  I went for a quick browse, hoping to get a GOT7 or VIXX album if they were around... and ended up getting EXODUS even when I thought I'd leave it alone.  The sale got to me.

<lj-cut text=""a final stab in the heart from what is left of China Line"">

I obviously annoyed the British Korean employee who was at the customer services desk when I asked her in the last minute (duh shit move on my part, I wasn't thinking) about whether there were other covers available.  She just picked up the one with Yixing on it.  I originally thought there would be more but it turns out the store hadn't updated their label on which EXODUS editions were still around.  So I couldn't get my Sai Lo or Jongin on the M cover as intended.  No big deal.

There was only Kyungsoo and Yixing left for the M version and it was slightly cheaper than the K one which is weird.  I just went with Yixing in the end.  I know, I know I'm getting indifferent to him lately because of some of the things he said about the other China Line bros though he's the sole survivor of the group so I'll let him be. In fact I don't know whether it's media play or personal opinion from the other members originally shading the ones who left but I'm sure everyone has moved on.

Anyway...I did regret for a moment from buying the album with Yixing on the cover <b><i>HOWEVER</i></b> I remembered there was a photocard included so that eased my guilt.  I did an unboxing <strike>fail</strike> video for a laugh and my reaction on when I got a specific photocard was amusing.  Who did I get?

Despite the ups and downs, despite my hesitance because of Hailang attitudes or Meigeni VS the entire fandom, EXO-Ls being shitty towards my favourite, my see-saw feelings towards my Sai Lo...he was on my photocard.  Well damn I didn't see that one coming.

Double China Line.  ISTG if this happened when I got the XOXO and Growl albums I would flip so hard.  My feels would've been all over the place.  I got Yifan from XOXO Korean version.  Just imagine getting a Taoris or a Krishan combo from the album purchases.  Another China Line member I got from a different album of a different group was Wenhan.

SM, I've boycotted most of your artists and that's possibly the last amount of money you'll get from me unless I decide to buy Love Me Right (how long till I decide to walk from JYPE or Big Hit? Don't let me down, faves. YG and SM are 2 out of the big 3 who I've said bye to).  Hopefully buying this album will prompt me to hurry up with the album review.  It's been tough since my old feelings from what happened linger now and then.  It's like Nightwish Tarja and Anette era all over again for me."

<lj-cut text=""hiddles"">

- Hiddles fanboying Robert De Niro and speaking highly of Kenneth Branagh.  Liked how Kenneth and Tom were sitting next to each other on the sofa.

- Branagh praising De Niro (Anne did too).  I completely forgot about Frankenstein in the early 90s omg.  Definitely remember that homoerotic scene when the creature jumped at Dr Frankenstein and they both wrestled ^^;; I've not seen the film however it was mentioned in detail during my horror module during year 2 of uni.

- Impersonations overload.  Yes you might think Tom overdid it and I wonder if it was out of nervousness because he was sitting next to big name seniors i.e. Robert De Niro and Kenneth Branagh.  I wouldn't blame him because if I was next to some highly respected names I'd shit myself. 

- I should make a note of what Anne Hathaway did when she worked with De Niro on The Intern.  Freak out at home and come into work professionally.

- Shame Twitter thinks Hiddles was showing off.  Technically he did butt in maybe twice while Graham was talking when he added more impersonations.

- The yodelling was cut off.  A fan mentioned the yodelling on Twitter.  Shame it was cut out.  Unless it was because Hiddles was so excited and nervous being on the show and babbled quite a bit as a result.  IDK.

- I hope De Niro approved of Tom's impersonations of him and Al Pacino from Heat.  The Al Pacino and Graham Norton ones were epic.  I knew he could do Owen Wilson and it seemed apparent Graham would go straight to him when he was talking about impersonations with De Niro.

- Hiddleboners...omg.  Did I ever get one back in the crazy fangirl days? Probably.

- Damn WYF and William Chan bromance is gold.

- Yang Yang has a great face.  It's so distracting.  That feeling in your belly when something surreal blows your mind.

- Managed to watch the cut scene where the guys smack the wall while they flirt with the female MCs.  WYF typicaly quoting his last lines from SOWK haha.

- Singing with distractions in K-TV omg not easy.

- Guessing each of the guests' clothes...was it bad I picked out WYF's one? It just screamed his style lol.</lj-cut>

So HLs saw him at LHR.  He was showered with gifts (typically a lot were from Harrods.  Can only be the minted HLs) and was obviously very kind to those who greeted him at the arrivals lounge and when he was at LFW for Versace show.  He arrived late (not his fault I don't think) and was shown to his seat at front row.

He does have the looks and grace to walk the runway in the same manner as WYF so I'm sure he'll get plenty of offers his way.  I saw the photoshoots and he looked great of course.  I suppose it would've been hard to pinpoint him in the city because you have a gazillion trendy, super minted Chinese here.

I think he went to the show on Friday but I was working and had to go to a training session.  Since I don't follow him as much as I used to as all those shits happened and the fandom rifts happened I didn't know he got an invite to come to LFW.  Well I hope you enjoy what you see HZT.  See you whenever.

I did go out on Saturday to eat at Seoul Bakery, scribbled optimistic shit on the wall in Hanzi about certain people and briefly visited Japan Matsuri to try more writing. Jolly.

<lj-cut text=""spidey sense"">

Regarding <a href=""http://goo.gl/CwwlwR"" target=""_blank"">this editorial</a> on HZT and the comments that followed 

Now before I say anything - yes I used to write for this website.  I felt a little lost after a few months as a writer for the team but persevered and was wondering whether to just go on a hiatus or quit after a shut down because of an opinion difference...then the Krishan lawsuits in 2014 made me switch off and I was thinking maybe I should go after all since my energy and fangirling was dropping.  Plus the attitudes in the team were a bit RME-worthy.  Now I see it just getting worse.  

The editorial itself...I somewhat get.  You think Tao's departure is iffy.  OK yeah there were some changes in his attitude since the lawsuit and he's being branded a hypocrite.  Yes I do see that.  Then the other comment from the staff saying how China Line took advantage of the negative issues SM had with their former idols who sued them is also iffy.  And then you say WYF wanted to leave SME because he had enough of the entertainment industry...wait what?    

I was really tempted to comment on how utterly stupid the ""Kris left SM because he wanted to leave the entertainment industry"" before someone else chimed in.  Where did he say that anyway? Show me the receipts before you blab that. I don't know whether your influence from another colleage who is a notorious fan for a big group within the same company is talking there but I think it's iffy in itself you don't research properly.  WYF wanted to be an actor and took a gamble when he became a trainee a long time ago.  He was absent prior to Wolf promos but then the studio published a statement on how he was kicked out originally. Yifan spilled a shitload of tea.  The commenters being shady, I suggest you watch his interview with Luyu.  

Also...them opposing EXO or China Line they need to get onto Weibo or read the fansite translations all over the web. How about watching the Sina Entertainment interview where they fucked Tao up and he even expressed genuine regret over the things he did?  As I said about that interview, staged or not...when Tao talks about his Duizhang ge it's a big deal.    

To even say you can't be bothered to check out other articles on China Line regarding interviews or statements and you say you're not a super SM fan...whether you're a fan or not you made a daft statement about WYF.  Then subtly blaming the Chinese members, even going as far as to say you'd rather watch paint dry or say the JYJ and Han Geng lawsuits were bigger issues than what my bros did.  Your bias are showing underneath the seemingly universal implied reader, website.  I'd never negate the JYJ and Hangeng events against what these guys did.  Everything here is a problem regardless of whether you're an old school ELF, EXO-L or Cassie.  Let's not shut others down by saying your issue is more superior than anyone else's.  We all need to voice our predicaments or whatever.          

Aside from the two commenters who provided plenty of info on Krishantao and discussed lawsuit terms of sorts...the comment section was generally a mess.  It just served as a platform for the specific staff who hate EXO to roast them and for anyone else to whack in whatever they want.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""being basic"">

So what has caused an explosion in the fandom? It's this:-

<i><b>Is Korea a major force in luxury?</b>

CL: I think a lot of the young kids right now are looking for something new,and they want to look different. Especially girls, and this is why I'm trying to come out here -- to set an example of an Asian girl. A lot of Asian girls love being basic because it's safe. But the thing is, a lot of my fans are those girls, and they want to be bolder, but there's no one they could look up to and be like, It's OK to be that way. There's no one out here who will do that, and I feel like I have done enough for Asia and changed a lot of girls. Even if it's a phone case, they try. Girls in Asia are very obedient, shy, timid, quiet, but I can tell that it's changing, and I want them to be stronger and tell them that it's OK to be different. Being special is a luxury, and I don't think we have that. Yet.</i>

CL I get what you were aiming for with being a role model but it was worded poorly [otoh <a href=""https://twitter.com/Honeyymac/status/639107240964833281"" target=""_blank"">this</a> is a bit more understandable and better said].  I know she stated in other interviews she wanted to encourage Asian women to be themselves, tell them it's okay to be different and be a role model in the form of a strong, independent female...but then this response appears.  It's almost like encouraging the West that these yellow fever stereotypes are okay to put on us.  I guess you don't pay attention to what Asians and Asian Americans or Asians born in the West are fighting against.

Also she should have clarified which Asians she was referring to.  What she's referring to is mostly East Asians.  You think ALL Asian women are obedient and shy and because they want to be like that?! We actually do have feelings.  Not all women are submissive. She even completely ignored the Dragon Lady with magical vaginas who can be so dominating.  We <i>Asians</i> do not have a specific character and can't win regardless.  It's either submissive flower or a strong, kick arse femme fatale who is happy to play the ""seme"" and fuck you hard. 

I'm not loud and confident like you CL because of my upbringing and how everything was fucking shit from the get-go.  I'm 'basic' and careful because I made mistakes from the past and not sure which styles or characters blend with me.  If you think I'm being obedient and basic because I'm programmed that way like a robot you are wrong.  I'm trying to find my place in life however not in your path.  Not in a GZB sense.

I salute you CL if you think you are a role model for self-conscious leng lui who want to be BAMF like you but you are far from somebody I'd personally say has done me any favours for an Asian female role model [I definitely fall in the same line as <a href=""http://omonatheydidnt.livejournal.com/16496084.html?thread=1303561172#t1303561172"" target=""_blank"">this</a> commenter though].   

She comes off as a privileged girl who thinks she knows it all from international schooling and travelling extensively and most likely got a ton of input from her Ang Mo friends in America.  Yet she said she had struggles of her own because she isn't a typical Korean beauty.  You know what, if that were so maybe you should elaborate on this as an East Asian woman.  Or have an open mind and hear what your Asian fans have to say because everyone has a story.  

I as a BBC/British Born Chinese had to go through a lot of things growing up.  I hated school, I hated every single human being in my class from the peers to the teachers.  I was discriminated from left to right by white, black, South Asians and South East Asians so forgive me if you think I'm too shy and basic for your own good <strike>the problem is recurring but the reasons are now different</strike>.  We'd probably have trouble maintaining our friendship if we were in the same school.  I'm not extroverted like you.  Seriously, after her comment on her <a href=""http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a15248/cl-2ne1-jeremy-scott-muse/?click=news"" target=""_blank"">lgbt fanbase</a> I never thought she'd slide deep to something like this.</lj-cut>

"event","Monday morning was not meant to go like this.

<lj-cut>

Wake up in the morning, feeling utterly blah and not looking forward to another week of work.  Log into Twitter to check some things and then wham...I read KT's tweet about Tao being interviewed (or interrogated *shudder*) by Sina.  

So I go read the interview translations which feature Krishan and holy fuck...did not see that coming.  The timeline goes ballistic.  Part of my inner Taoris shipper heart leaps in a good way.  Tao admitted his recklessness last year was a bad move and even says he doesn't know if WYF will forgive him, yet he's still in touch with Luhan.

This Krishantao realness is strong.  Yet some notorious Hailang have gotten furious and accused Katie and other folk of MGN/Lufan/Krishan community of making shit up or mistranslating, even going overboard from other stuff. Just...no.  KT linked to the source so you can all go read it.  Thankfully some MGN who happen to be Tao fans translated the interview in its entirety. Sina really ripped the hell out of Tao in this interview.  

Staged or not, I have this feeling that Tao's words felt legit, namely regarding WYF.  It feels like a little confirmation that he admitted he fucked up and seriously people don't start denying the times you yourselves fucked up in rash behaviour.  Whether Wu Yifan will accept the apology when he sees this interview is up to him. Don't push it, fandom.  And MGNs please don't overdo the clawing at Tao.

I understand you're angry or are all RME/SMH with Tao's words and actions last year regarding WYF's lawsuit but everybody has to back off a bit here.  He had injuries like his elder bros did during his time at SM.  Don't ignore what he said in this interview.  KrisKingdom1106 shame on you for posting your shit up.  You're pissed off, okay put it in your personal blog.  Not on a WYF one ffs.  The amount of Cantonese profanity I want to throw at her is huge right now.  She's  pulling off a Cherry and that is NAGL.

Well Zitao, you may as well join my personal table of outcasts/rejects with your bros.  Come along and join us.

I'm not going to lie but I secretly want him or WYF to post a pic on their SNS.  Taoris awakening.  How about a caption to say ""The boys are back in town?""</lj-cut>

<b>Potentially big three</b> would be:-

<u>Yoshiki / X Japan</u> - because X Japan got me through a lot of things, opened up my mind beyond the rock and roll.  Made me a hardcore Jrock fan.  Art of Life is epic AF.  It represents who I am and Yoshiki, despite his ridiculous drama queen moments, when he performs on stage he goes all out, especially with the piano.

<u>Tuomas Holopainen / Nightwish</u> - like X Japan, Nightwish took me to another world.  Hit me with magical lyrics that reassured me.  Reflections of my mind.  So many songs to pick but I have to go with Ghost Love Score.

<u>Josh Groban</u> - therapeutic voice and always soothes me.  A song which could be considered Josh's work...impossible to choose.  Maybe Oceano, Alle Luce Del Sole or You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)

Not yet a musical artist/idol of all time but Wu Yifan hit me so hard with his presence.  He's not perfect in vocals or dancing and that's okay.  EXO!OT12 will always have a place in my heart.  But who Wu Yifan is and how he reached to the deepest part of my soul was a first <strike>and my last</strike>.  Growl...you got me good.  Peter Pan (Chinese ver) you also got me good.  As for WYF's solo stuff...There Is A Place no doubt.  

This also applies to B.A.P and Bangtan Sonyeondan.  They've gotten to the level of fangirl feels that BIGBANG originally gave me in my early VIP journey.     My favourite B.A.P songs are probably One Shot, 1004 (Angel), Coma and I Remember.  BTS...I Need U (:D), Let Me Know, Tomorrow, Johayo, We Are Bulletproof pt 2 and Sick/Dope - so far."

my sister Samantha came over for thanksgiving and is not leaving tell January something and im going out of my mind!!

Derek and I are in the mist of a fight, I brouhgt up the simple fact that Kaite is trying and succedding and replacing me, she has taken my friends and my image, and all thats left of me is waht I pretand to be see i didnt even come up with that on my own!! o well and I also brought up the fact that Derek NEVER EVER talks to me anymore, the onely time he talkes to me is when I force him to or when there is no one let to talk to, 

I told you all that this would happen that you all would relive that I am indeed alot younger then you and the fact that you are friends is just pathetic in your eyes and I warned you all but you just turned away and siad yea right just like you are now!! 

O well what can I do. 
1.) my sister is taking my life
2.) my friends are all forgetting me
3.) my family can bairly remember my name
4.) the only time some one even notices me is when they get to tell me no!!
5.) the only time Derek ever talkes about being my father anymore is when he wants somthing like $5 for ciggeretts, or nyquil and do you know what I want something simple a BEDTIME STORY!!

o well life will go one in the eyes of Laura!!

oh.. paper flowers
oh.. paper flowers

I linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name
Let me stay
Where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story

In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby flowers
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me flowers

Don't say I'm out of touch
With this rampant chaos - your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I built my own world to escape

In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby flowers
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me flowers

Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights
Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
The Goddess of imaginary light

In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby flowers
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me flowers


oh.. paper flowers
oh.. paper flowers"

"event","The tears I bled for you. 


I sit in the dark
a place you'll never see
You have left a mark
It causes me to bleed

You broke my heart
and tore my skin
I knew it from the start
yet I still let you in

I look into your eyes
the ones I used to love
now filled with despise
like your so far above

it mey not have been you 
who too the knife with ease
but you were there when it was done
and now your on your knees

you saw my blood tears falling down
hot upon my face
you saw as I went crashing down
with no syle or grace

you saw the blood pour out of me
you saw the note I left
explaining what you couldn't see
the heart you stole through theft

I don't know whyI let you in
and mess with my heartstrings
all I know is this is the end
I have no more unwanted flings

they buried me in the next day
going was to you a chore
for it was your fault that May
that I would be seen no more"

"event","Suicide - you wish for something to end - well here it is:

I do not want to carry on my fight
I want to run away into the night
I wish to fall to my knees
And feel death spread on me as a disease
I do not want to hear a lie
All I want is to simply die
Cannot I leave this painful place
And enter another time and space
I curse myself and torture my soul
Pain can fill my empty hole
I wish to die but cannot go
my sanity is saying no
So instead I bring pain to all around
And no one hears my screams so Im not found
laying here lost in my mind
Laying here asking for death to be kind"

"event","""Cut"" - Results: 

 

My lust for pain and blood 
leaves me with no choice


Measly scissors call to me 
with a tempting voice

I push hard and drag it across 
my wrist

Over and over, I do not desist

Oblivious to the slicing pain 
it brings

I watch the blood trickle from 
the wound

Rolling over my wrist bone

Sprinkling crimson droplets on 
my diary.

A tear dares spring from my 
eye

Regret in its physical form

It lands on the wound, 
stinging

The watery red smearing my 
writings

As more tears threaten to fall 
I lick the wound

In remembrance of the feeling 
I once knew so well

The pain, the fear, yet I miss 
it so

The hatred, the numbness, the 
will to just go

I clench my fist and shake it 
at the sky

All the while, asking myself 
why

In bitterness I let the pain 
continue 'til it heals

Everyone calls it the act of a 
coward

A lowly, miserable disgrace

But might they do the same 
thing,

If they were in my place?"

The Fantastic Four is what Kaite calles us, but its kinda funny how easy i can be replaced, how much Im forgotten, how much it hurt to see the sun signing brightly over there heads while im left in the dark!! Love is a lost myth, love is a once forgotten momery, love is but a fairytail that help you sleep at night, whats keeping me here, what holds me back, its you, One day you'll see how unhappy i can be, and that your be sorry when im gone, so you know Debbie you can have my spot, but i hope you can be a better me then me.

Here you go.&nbsp; First of all hiiiiiiii.&nbsp; I'm dra.&nbsp; Lets just say for sakes of it I am great with other peoples relationships, but when it comes to mine, it sucks.

I've been dating this guy for around a year now.&nbsp; He plays hockey and recently got switched to a new team.&nbsp; I met his new team members.&nbsp; Of which one is amazing.&nbsp; Hes tall, super cute and seems nice.&nbsp; I don't know that much about him though.&nbsp; My boyfriend and I are on the rocks but still dating.&nbsp; Yet, I have a feeling that its going to end soon.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would love to get to know this new guy for name sakes we'll call him brian lol.. Yet I'm still dating jake.&nbsp; Jake is a great guy and so is brian.&nbsp; Jake and Brian are really close.&nbsp; I tried sending brian an IM the other day, no response.&nbsp; Brian has told jake that he is somewhat interested.&nbsp; Stuff like ""wow brian you're girlfriend is super hot.&nbsp; How did you get her"".. blah blah blah.&nbsp; How can I get Brian to notice me.&nbsp; Why is he avoiding me?&nbsp; What the heck man !"

"">Back track to early october.&nbsp; Angie, her sister Krista, Kristas boyfriend and this boy were supposed to go out.&nbsp; Everyone bails but Angie and This boy named ""Brent""...So they ask me to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;We go to Canada.&nbsp; Brent and I are on the dance floor.&nbsp; Hes religious, super hot, and perfect eyes ! There we were dancing.. when all the sudden he kisses me.&nbsp; Now.. I don't know if Angie likes him at this point so&nbsp;I don't know what to do.&nbsp; I'm not sure if brent likes me.&nbsp; We go back to the hotel and we all share a bed.&nbsp; I let him know I'm interested by resting my head on his chest.&nbsp; I slowly kiss his neck and go down his stomach.&nbsp; All the sudden he starts rubbing my legs.&nbsp; He then puts his fingers in me.&nbsp; He proceeds to kiss me.. all the while Angie is on his other side. hahahaha.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He feels me up and I just want to crawl on him and fuck his brains out.&nbsp; So yeah.. Here I am, scratching the shit out of his arm cause I'm ready to scream.&nbsp; Fastfoward that was fun a week later... Katyln and Jane ask me to go to a party.&nbsp; I invite Brent.&nbsp; for three hours, brent and i are going at it hardcore in this chick alicyas bathroom.&nbsp; I ended up giving him some hardcore oral.. haha i love saying that.&nbsp; Seriously though.&nbsp; I told him to lay down, and i went to town.. Soooo can't hardly wait.&nbsp; haha...&nbsp;<br /><br />We went to a movie two weeks later.&nbsp; We talked on the phone, but he never really made a move to hang out with me again. .then comes the text ""when am i seeing you again?""&nbsp; my response ""as soon as you ask me to"".&nbsp; so he did... Movies.. we held hands, kissed, all that junk.&nbsp; I didn't make any of the moves.. We were in my car talking about decisions and life .&nbsp; He goes ""Want to make a bad decision"" ... ""Yeah""&nbsp; i repeat ""Kiss me then"".. so we did.&nbsp; I ended up hanging out with him 3 more times.&nbsp; All just embarrassed staring at eachother and lame text messages while hanging out with other people.&nbsp; Not sure what the hell he wants.&nbsp; Seems to me like he likes me, but isn't sure if i'm going to make the girlfriend that he is looking for.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention that angies sister and mother work with him.&nbsp; God only knows what they say about me.&nbsp; I think angie might like him as well.&nbsp; who knows.&nbsp; I just want to figure what the fuck this kid is thinking. <br /><br />I ended up meeting a bunch of new people on halloween, and chilled with them a couple times.&nbsp; I'm trying to hook up janey with one, but of course angie is all over him. So We all hang out a couple times.&nbsp; Then comes earlier this week.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I got into a huge fight with my family and stormed out.&nbsp; I ended up calling the same kid that i was trying to hook janey up with... janey told me meh she wasnt really interested.&nbsp; How could she not be?&nbsp; hes gorgeous.&nbsp; Tall, dark,&nbsp; soo fucking hott.&nbsp; Anyway.. So I call him (his name is nate) and I meet up with him at his house.&nbsp; Never one to turn down a night out, we go out drinking.&nbsp; He makes me laugh so much.&nbsp; I love that about him.&nbsp; We go to a bar or 3.. have a drink or 9, and get something to eat.&nbsp; We go back to his place and start talking and laughing.&nbsp; We lay in his bed and watch tv.&nbsp; He slowly moves his hands up and down me.&nbsp; We leaned in and kissed.&nbsp; He got on top of me and started kissing me.&nbsp; He went lower until his head was deep in me.&nbsp; ""god damn"" he said ""can i fuck you?"".. ""if you really want to"" i said back to him.&nbsp; so there we have it.&nbsp; We fucked... not mind blowing sex, but sex enough.&nbsp; He put my legs behind my head and went to town on me.&nbsp; He was agressive, and he knew what I wanted.&nbsp; A one night stand pretty much.&nbsp; My first ever !&nbsp; Hopefully I'll chill with him again.&nbsp; He did text me the next day to say that he had a lot of fun the night before.&nbsp; Problem though.... all my other friends ie angie wants him .... but fuck that angie wants everyone.&nbsp; If she broke my chances with brent, she won't with nate.&nbsp;<br /><br />FUCK THOUGH I AM SO OBSESSED WITH BRENT.&nbsp; I GUESS AS THE OLD SAYING GOES..&nbsp;<br />"" I WANT WHAT I CANT HAVE"" <br /></div>"

I got a text an hour later as I was laying in bed next to my fiancee.. it read.. ""Man it takes a silly girl to lie about the dream she has.. lord it takes a lonely one..."" and I texted back ""to wish that she had never dreamn't at all""<br /><br />""Who was that"" my fiancee asked me<br />""my friend hope"" I said back.. and I cried myself to sleep <br /></div>"

He sits next to me at work.&nbsp; When I first met him he was the typical guy.&nbsp; Nothing special.&nbsp; Skinny, Somewhat tall 5'10ish... Amazing blue eyes ... Beautiful.&nbsp; Vegan, kind of immature.. My age which I promised myself I would never date again.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Days passed.&nbsp; At first we got along.&nbsp; All laughed together.. Talked about lame stuff.&nbsp; We always would just talk about how much we wanted eachother.. theres pretty much no limit.. Example :&nbsp; 

""I'm so hard for you right now"" 
""Yeah?&nbsp; Well don't tell me to much more I want to be surprised"" 
""What if we just went into your car and fucked?"" 

We were talking about just kissing for a minute to see if there was anything there.&nbsp; 

""I couldn't do it dra"" 
""Why not?"" 
""Cause I know there would be something and I couldn't stop"" 

Everyone leaves to get new jobs.&nbsp; We are 2 out of 4 people left.&nbsp; We become extremely close.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
""Why do you have to be engaged?&nbsp; To a cop... Come on.. A cop?&nbsp; He would kill me.&nbsp; I want to kiss you so bad.. I just can't do it.&nbsp; I can't do it&nbsp;.&nbsp; I have to be good.&nbsp; Have to be good. ""&nbsp; 

We sit against eachother backs turned against the wall that&nbsp;parts us.&nbsp; I know we are just staring through the other side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
We went out to lunch together.&nbsp; A week now.. just us.&nbsp; We look into eachothers eyes.. we laugh..&nbsp; 
He was tired today.&nbsp; He put his hand on mine.&nbsp; I took my hand and ran it up and down his arm.. We just stared at eachother.&nbsp; He sighed and leaned back against the wall.. closed his eyes ""It feels so good"" He said to himself over and over.&nbsp; *smiles*.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
""I have to be good I have to be good""&nbsp; He just repeated over and over.&nbsp; 

He wont' kiss me.&nbsp; Cause I'm engaged.&nbsp; Hes respectful.&nbsp; I've never wanted something so much in my life.&nbsp; So much in fact... that... I think I'm going to tell B whats going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

He fills my half empty cup."

Lets go lovers...&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><div class=""ljcut"" text=""The whipped list"">When I first saw him he was the average guy.&nbsp; Tall, southern accent, so good looking, nice arms that you know could just throw you down and hold your legs back over your shoulders.&nbsp; I'm talking straight up fuck fest.&nbsp; For all intensive purposes or his wife reading this and wanting to kill me ( again) we'll call him pat.&nbsp;<br /><br />Pat worked with me.&nbsp; He drove the trucks while I took the orders.&nbsp; He would always come and talk to my boss, my coworkers, but never me.. When he would leave for the day he would only say goodbye to me and tell me at least one thing that looked good that day.&nbsp; The time came where it was his last day.&nbsp; When he said goodbye he ran his fingers down my hair and massaged my shoulders for what I wanted to last forever.&nbsp; That night we were all going out.&nbsp; After I got his phone number I called him up.&nbsp; He said he wasn't going cause he was sick.&nbsp; Fair enough.&nbsp; 4 hours later I was wasted at the bar.&nbsp; I sent him a message saying ""Sorry that you're sick man...feel better"".. That was the end.&nbsp; Or so I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The next day his wife sends me a txt after trying to call 11 times !&nbsp; ""What the fuck dont you understand about pat being married..Back off bitch"".&nbsp; I wrote her one back saying how I had no intentions of anything.&nbsp;<br /><br />The next day it was a lot of peoples last days.&nbsp; I was walking around with everyone laughing when I saw him&nbsp;<br />""Drama""<br />""What are you doing here""<br />""We need to talk""<br />He brought me back to one of the back rooms.&nbsp; ""Why did you send me that txt message""<br />""To make you feel better""&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />""My wife was asking me questions about you all night""<br />""So... what am I supposed to do about it""<br />""I needed to see you again.&nbsp; I wanted to just end on the right foot.&nbsp; I never got a proper goodbye""<br />THE NEXT THING&nbsp; I KNOW..

Finally a txt.&nbsp; ""Stay late tonight... see you at 5:30.""<br />I rolled my eyes... I stayed.&nbsp; Everyone had left.. Pat pulled up in his car&nbsp; ""Get in"".&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; We went to a park and talked about his marriage and my engagement.&nbsp; We both understood what needed to happen.&nbsp; We could never talk again because things would get weird.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />""I'm sorry I sent that txt pat""<br />""I'm not""&nbsp; He replied as he kissed me.&nbsp; I couldn't take it.&nbsp; I knew it was the last time.&nbsp; He slowly slid my shirt over my head as I did the same to him.&nbsp; His perfect abs and my flat stomach went perfectly as I slowly crawled on top of him.&nbsp; As he kissed my neck and slid his tounge around my tits I felt amazing.&nbsp; I leaned back and let him keep going.&nbsp; That however was the end of it.&nbsp; We stopped and drove back to my work.&nbsp; As I was getting out of the car Pat looked at me and said ""I'm sorry"".&nbsp; I looked back at him and said ""I'm not""&nbsp;<br /><br />MY LIFE SHOULD BE A FUCKING MOVIE.&nbsp;&nbsp; Haven't heard from him since... kind of glad too..

I ended up fixing that.&nbsp; I flipped him on his back&nbsp; "" You suck at what you do... but now its my turn"".&nbsp; (thats right bitches i'm a pimp when it comes to ironic quotes).&nbsp; I slid my tounge down his stomach and placed my mouth around his cock.&nbsp; 5 minutes later he let out a scream and again my mouth was filled.. with... Knuckle babies (God damn I love that phrase).&nbsp; I layed back down cause I'm not a bitch about cleaning up after.&nbsp; I layed there and he started to touch me.&nbsp; ""Can I record you touching me?"" I said to him ""Yeah"" he said back.&nbsp; For those who don't know, I get off on watching myself and my guys.&nbsp; Call it bitchy if you want, its hott.&nbsp; As he touched me I told him about how we have to hook up at work sometime.&nbsp; He promised it would be soon.&nbsp; My body was shaking as I was trying to hold the camera still.&nbsp; I finally threw the camera down and placed my hands on his.&nbsp; With my legs open and my body shaking, I put more and more pressure on his hands as his fingers ran up and down me.&nbsp; It felt soo amazing.&nbsp; The next morning we took a shower together.&nbsp; Again I sucked his cock, and he licked my pussy.&nbsp; It felt amazing.</div><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Long way down...

Christmas time brings on a horrible pain. I don't let others see my pain, which could be why I am always full. I specifically listen to 3 songs in order to force tears from the bottle. 

Far - At Night We Live
Kodaline - All I Want
New Found Glory - When I Die

These songs make me miss you. They remind me why I love you so much. They remind me that I will never get to see you again. They help me empty the bottle. But no matter how much I pour you out, you're never gone, and you never will be. And that's how I want it."

"event","Some days I feel like I'm wasting my life. I've always looked at my life almost like a 12 step program. A junkie on life. I have to climb hurdle after hurdle to get to the next until I reach the top of the stairs, and I die. But right now I feel like when I get to step 12 it will be as if I was skipping every other stair. I was moving along so smoothly, from finishing school, to getting a ""career"", buying the car I've always wanted, getting my own house. 

But I'm missing some major steps: Love, and travel. Here's the problem, the two at least for me come hand in hand. I don't want to travel alone. I mean deep down inside me, way down, is a deep yearning to just be alone. But that's the darker side of me taking over. I want to experience the world with someone else. I want to share deep intimate experiences half way across the world with someone. I want to grab her hand and plummet out of a plane, or off the top of a waterfall. I want to gaze at the northern lights from the side of a massive ship with her. Where is she?

Money has also become an issue. Traveling becomes secondary to being a functioning adult. Trying to fix up this house, and buy everyday things for it, paying grown up bills. I'd like to set aside a travel fund, but until you have someone to travel with the motivation isn't there. 

I really want to do an insane road trip with a bunch of my dude friends and hopefully have some kind of crazy experience like you see in the movies. I should start the wheels on making that happen."

"event","The weekdays drag on. The weeknights are even longer. I yearn for the weekends. When you torture yourself with something the weekdays become your mortal enemies. Going to work and spending most of your day alone or in silence is unforgiving. Your mind beats on your insides repeatedly. You only eat out of necessity not out of hunger. The nights aren't any better. Trying to sleep becomes quite the task. It's the absolute most perfect time for your mind to destroy you. Silence manifests pain. It manifests possibility. It turns your brain into a super computer that can compute an unlimited amount of possibilities with your current situation. Most of them are bad. But we all know this. 

The weekend offers some kind of solace. A little bit of peace from the demons running the super computer at full power. Shutting it down for a while to do things the weekdays don't normally permit. 2 days."

My horrible mind has taken to playing tricks on me, and it has taken you out. Pictures are slowly become vacant memories. Slowly your things have disappeared from my world, and so have you. Sometimes I swear I have even forgotten the sound of your voice. 

Letting you go is ripping me to shreds. I wish I could blink and forget you. But you are like a ghost to me now. A presence that is always around, but absolutely unreachable. I had hoped this would all be over by now, but you are deep rooted in my veins.  

The loss we suffered was the most naked moment I have ever had in my entire life. It's something I will never be able to shake. It haunts me to this day, and it will until my final days. In the midst of such a horrible tragedy, I had you. I was broken all the way to my core, but you held me together. And I will always remember that."

I turned 30 September 1st. I secretly hate it. Obviously I don't feel any older. But fuck, 30? It's the jump from the 20's to the 30's that makes it a big deal. The next jump into the 40's is going to be ridiculous. 30's just still sounds old to me. It makes me feel creepy. I don't want to be a creepy old man. I don't look 30, but still.

It's literally been I think upwards of 4 1/2 years since we went to a convention. I miss them SO MUCH. I'm not even the biggest horror fan, but just to get out for a weekend and do something weird and different is awesome. <lj user=""danny_exclm_pnt"" /> even hung out on Saturday. For some reason the main focus of the weekend turned out to be finding me a fat goth chick to bang. Then I realized that may have been the main focus of every convention we had done in the past. It hasn't happened....yet.... The only thing that really sucked was that we weren't staying in the hotel. So after each day we went right home. I'm hoping we go to Horror Hound Weekend next because those are always awesome. It's nice when you're staying in the hotel because you can hang out in the lobby by the bar and get wasted and see some fucked up shot happen in the lobby like someone getting stabbed. Fingers crossed. I CAN'T BE BOTHERED

I have bad/good luck when it comes to work. When I actually get super busy at normal work, I get tons of calls about people needing side work. And then when I work is slow, no one calls. CUT ME A BREAK PEOPLE. I'm not really mad because I like to get all the money all the time. 

A friend I've known for years has recently peaked my interest to the max. 

I came up with a new savings plan. So I took all of these envelopes and a sharpie marker. I write what I want and how much it costs on the envelopes, and when I have some extra or bonus cash it goes into specific envelopes. I figure this is the best way for me to divide up money I want for specific things. Then I don't have to take a massive chunk of cash out of my bank account to pay for things I want.

You could have convinced yourself you're 100 percent over that person. Once you see them with someone else you instantly get filled with rage and jealousy. ""What makes that fucking guy so great?""

It's a hard transition going from talking to someone everyday and seeing them a ton and then going to random texts every so often. I've been pondering relationships a lot. The fact that you don't every really 100 percent know if you are going to spend the rest of your life with someone. So many things can change. That's why I don't understand why people get married within a year of dating. If I based marriage off that, I'd be divorced 4 times by now. The beginning is always the best. The real test is if you can dig through all the shit together and come out clean on the other side. Then you know you're ready to take the plunge. 

Then again, a lot of people don't seem to have to dig. Clear sailing into the sunset. I'm not one of those people. Everything gets hard for me. Is it me? Is it them? Is it us? I don't know, and I feel like I never will. Maybe I'm thinking too hard about it. This is life and tons of people go through this, I am not special, I am also not privileged.  

That wedding we went to, the 2 getting married had previously dated, and they broke up for 3 years. I think it's incredible they can turn it around after 3 years. It's like it is impossible to completely close some books.

I was afraid it was going to be awkward because we just broke up but it wasn't bad at all. We didn't really know anyone at the wedding, but we ended up meeting this awesome couple that were super awesome so we hung out with them all night. They ended up driving us back to my house and we exchanged info and made new friends which is great. <p>&nbsp;</p>Here is where the bullshit comes into play. Mike had some people over and they were hanging out outside so I hung with them. Well Nicole comes out and goes ""are you coming upstairs?"" To which I replied, eventually. Mike got some pissy attitude with me about what I was going to do next. To which I got pissed off. <p>&nbsp;</p>I don't feel it's anybodys place but my own to get in my face about my own ""love"" life. Unless I'm getting totally fucked and cheated on.

He's not home. I decide to stay while Kyle and Mike go retrace the route in hopes of finding the keys. Because if they don't, Jason is our only hope. I sit on his porch for what felt like forever. Finally, Mike gets back, alone. Drops the bike in the driveway and is panting like a dog. Kyle gave up. Just then Jason pulls in to save the flippin day. <p>&nbsp;</p>He takes us home, Mike's keys are inside the house. Jason, Mike, and I get in the hot tub for 2 hours.

So what stresses me is are they going to get on my case or get pissed at me for not telling them yet? I don't know. Will it be me standing in a room in front of a desk of a like 5 old people like you would see in a movie? Or am I just 1 of many who will be there all at the same time. They are basically calling me down to give me my ""real"" journeyman's card. And to pay some make up dues for something. It's stupid, they could just mail the shit to me and send me a bill for the dues I owe. But the whole situation has got me on edge and I don't know why. I just want to get it over with. It's probably because most of the higher ups in the Union turn out to be assholes.  

It's got me acting stand offish lately, and believe me I can tell. I hate feeling like this. I'm also 3 weeks late on my mortgage payment which is stressing me out. All my other bills are paid except this one. The main reason is I've been doing a lot of work for this lady in Prospect Heights, and she is yet to pay me. She owes me somewhere in the ballpark of 1200-1300 dollars, and there is still more work to be done there. Getting that money would solve my mortgage issue at least for now. And I can hold out until my tax return comes around which should hopefully be massive. And I'm hoping work picks up in the next couple months and Kevin can hire me back. 

I'm also hoping something will come out of this suing t-mobile thing. I know 75grand would be amazing, but I'll take anything. I keep hoping I'll end up with the extra money for Nicole's Christmas present but it's just not happening. If I had space on a damn credit card I would've bought it already but of course they canceled the only one that wasn't maxed out because I didn't use it.

I Will Always Find You</b>

I found another naked moment
A new forever kind of love
I traced the sunrise, rode upon it
And wrote another song about it

In the sun and in the rain and in the day and in the night
I will always find you

You're tired of keeping us together
I'm pushing harder for your heart
You could not bear to face it sober
My love is pulling us apart

In the sun and in the rain and in the day and in the night
I will always find you

(because i) still wanna love you
Still feel the same tonight
I'm still dreaming of you
Still wanna try

I'm barely keeping it together
This hurt is harder than your heart
How could you say that it was over

In the sun and in the rain and in the day and in the night
I will always find you

Still wanna love you
Still feel the same tonight
I'm still dreaming of you
Still wanna try

Just tell me who would want me now
You've taken part of who i am
Just tell me who would even look
At a ruined shell
Who's hanging by a string 
Of all the empty words you speak
I'll listen to them till the end of time
Just keep your face in front of mine

In the sun and in the rain and in the day and in the night
I will always find you

Still wanna love you

I'm still dreaming of you

I sometimes think that I'm ok, and that I'm as over it as I can be, but at the end of the day I really know I'm not. I'm definitely doing a ton better than I was, but it's like there is a robot in my brain made just because of her. And even though she left, he didn't, and he is a memory machine, and he makes me hurt. He makes me lose my appetite, or upsets my stomach. He turns a good day immediately bad. He plays memory videos and sound clips in my head, and pictures. Sometimes I hate robots. 

I know sometime soon I will be fine, but when you are completely content in a relationship that comes to an end, it's so much harder to get over that person. 

Before I go, and I'm sorry I rambled on for so long, there is one more 1997 song that really completely sums it all up. Just the end of it really, and it really puts a whole other twist on something we are conditioned to believe. If you love someone, let them go. But:

No one ever taught me
What i really need to know.
Like how to love someone, 
And let em' go...

Let em' go, let em' go
How can you really love someone,
And let em' go?"

I have this shitty feeling in my gut. I hate it and I don't know what it's there for. That anxiousness of something, but what? I mean when I think I'm done being stressed out, this? 

I always do have this constant strain of doubt in my head. Like, is it possible to be doing too much for someone? Like I've bought Heidi a decent amount of things, and I didn't think it was too much, but I feel like maybe it is now. I like to think thanks to past relationships I've learned what you should and should not do in them. But I have this worry that a lot of people we're in such bad past relationships they aren't used to being treated like a human being, and don't know how to handle it. I know Mike has had trouble with some semi recent relationships because the girls were used to being treated like crap. And a nice guy comes along, and they freak. I feel like that might have been part of the reason Brittany cut herself off from me. Some people are scared of commitment and serious relationships, and I'm not, but I don't want to come on too strong and push someone away. I care so much about Heidi, and I don't want to blow it. So much stress, now I realize where this knot comes from."

They don't even set aside money when they get some to give to me. Upwards of 1000 dollars combined. And that's not counting my mother who owes me an unspeakable amount. I'm not complaining because I don't have money, or because I'm a dick, but because, it's mine. It always was mine.

I'm a good person, and I still feel like after I die I'm going to just have my ashes dumped out somewhere that I love. And that's fucking it.

The Des Plaines river has flooded the whole world, and it took me 2 and a half hours to get home from Niles today. I was literally having a nervous breakdown in my work van, and of course nobody knows how to drive, so I was about to go on a rampage. Grand Theft Auto style. 

In better news, I have a fancy new girlfriend. Her name is Brittany, not Britney. She rules, and sometimes I think is a bigger nerd than I am. Which is refreshing cause when I talk about something really nerdy, she counter nerds me with some comment about space, or something. Makes me feel nerd safe. She so far gets along fantastically with my friends, especially Phil....something, is going on there that I haven't figured out yet.

1st Unofficial date was several weeks back we saw Step Brothers, at the streets of woodfield, which rules go see it, and then we snuck into Hancock, where I revealed to her that was the 1st movie I ever snuck into ever, and she shit a brick of sorts. 

1st Official date was saturday night. I decided on Sept. 11th that would have to be the date we started dating because of obvious reasons, but I did the official ask out saturday....she said yes....nice work TJ. I thought hard on where to go, and I thought of the place that rules so hard, so we went to Tsukasa. She at some point said something on the ride about a kitchen, and I'm like, ""oh there is no kitchen where we are going"" which perplexed her to the max. Which made me glad it would be more of a surprise. So when we finally got there and went in, and her face lit up like a little kid at Hanuka, I mean Christmas. I mean, Kwanzaa. Instant sigh of relief. I showed her the brain busting game Braid, and we watched Man vs Wild, and both screamed a lot cause Bear decided to use a sheep as a sheepingbag and cut it open and take a bite out of it's god damn heart, what a maniac. So all in all I thought everything went awesome, and I put my nervous heart to rest. 

So in the next few months have to, try to buy a house and get my wisdom teeth mercilessly ripped and cut from my mouth. Which I have been slacking on for many reasons such as the fear of, sorry you can't buy a house, cause we aren't gonna give you money. Or, yeah we'll have to hammer and chisel your wisdoms out cause they aren't fully grown in yet. Bastards. 

Rock Band 2 is out, and it's all we did all sunday, my brain was so god damn fried. There is a 300 dollar drumset for it I'm going to buy, and the main reason is cause you can plug it into your computer and record drums on there with it which is AMAZING. That is all. Thanks for coming. Stay tuned."

I met a lot of cool people from different websites, and cool people that work at E.A.

She was in a rehibilitation place after her surgery, so she didn't have to stay at the hospital. Apparently someone checked on her at about 8am  and she was fine. And sometime in the next 2 hours she choked on vomit and died. My brain swells at how totally fucked up that is. How if she was in a hospital she would have been hooked up to a machine and they would have known if something was wrong. Or if she was lying on her side or stomach this wouldn't have happened. She was ok, she was going to be ok, and some freak accident bullshit happened. I still can't believe it.

When my great grandma died I remember seeing her in the hospital, and she didn't remember who I was. She was starting to look bad. She would always tell me about when she played with me when I was little all the time. I crouched down next to her bed, put my head down and cried for what seemed like forever until there was a puddle on the floor.

2: There were 2 faucets in the guys bathroom, and one was hooked up but not mounted to the sink and the water was shut off. So I turned it on and Kiel goes ""Hey this dudes a plumber!"" and some random dude in the bathroom goes ""oh hell yeah he is!""
3: Some dude asked tom to shut off the faucet in the bathroom, he proceeded to shut it off, with his foot, and break the handle.
4: Phil had his leg draped over a rail, and some girl came up, proceeded to bite his leg, and kept calling him her husband. He proceeded to ignore her, and not bang her. We ripped on him, and now he slaps himself and calls himself an idiot. 
5: Some girl had MEGA B.O.
6. There was an pool forming if I could get the waitress's phone number. At the end of the night she was talking to some dude in a backwards baseball hat. So I wrote on ticket stubs, (this is me, 1 shot of jack and 7 whiskey sours into the night) ""dudes who wear backwards hats usually turn out to be douche bags."" Left my name, number and a smiley face, gave it to her, ran immediately to Tom, and said, ""it's done we gotta get outta here!""

Because while it took me a bit to feel comfortable about Melissa dating someone else, I feel almost as if, I will always be 99.9% over someone I had a serious relationship with, because I feel like you never really know what will happen in the future. If I had a serious relationship, I would probably never be 100% over that person, especially, if I was still into it, and they gave up or ended it. I mean what if I get married and my wife turns out to be a bitch 3 kids down the road, I divorce her, and end up meeting up with an old girlfriend, that 0.01% might kick me in the balls and say, hey, anything can happen. 

I think I might be going crazy?"

Bought a digital camera. 3 days after I got it, found a better one and bought that. Anyone interested in the 1st one? 7megapixel Polaroid, big lcd screen, its pretty awesome, comes with a rechargeable battery. 75 dollars i'll sell it for. Paid 85. It's pristine. Also have a regular dvd player that i'm giving away. If you want it you have to come get it though. And maybe check out my balls."

Dan Tye was taking about going to the tortugas, which further sparked my interest in seeing more National Parks. I really want to see, Acadia, Great Smokey Mountains, Waterton Glacier, Olympic, Shenandoah most of all, Rocky Mountains, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and so many more.

I'll be joining up with Tom on BD for an upcoming horror video games section. I'm super fucking pumped about it. Within the next 4 months all my good shit will be colliding. 

February 9th, and April 19th will be the 2 biggest tests I have ever taken in my life. I'm so stupid nervous about them. Even though if I fail I can take them again, but I would have to wait 4 months, and that is not cool. So I'm gonna go ahead and try to pass them the 1st time.

"event","I want to know if this sounds weird, and I know it sounds cynical and mean but when I hear that people ""tried"" to kill themselves and didn't actually succeed, I feel like they didn't really want to die. Like, ""I took a bunch of pills, and went to sleep."" or ""I was driving and I let go of the wheel hoping I would hit something."" ""I used to cut my wrists."" If I was going to kill myself, I would just make sure I fucking died.

Like instead of taking some random pills, and going to sleep and probably waking up with a bad stomach ache, I would take something that would finish me off quickly. Or if I was driving, I would jerk the god damn wheel so I flipped off the side of a cliff or something. I wouldn't cut my wrists, I'd stick something in my god damn neck and rip it open so I bled out in seconds. Or do anything that would ensure you would die and not feel anything, gun shot to the head or dive head first of a balcony. If you're gonna kill yourself, just fucking do it. I don't care if you want the attention. Fucking grow up. I'm not going to your funeral if you do. You don't deserve it."

So hey everyone lets hang out!

My bands cd is moving along quickly. We have drums and bass completely done. And we are almost done with the guitar. Then its vocals, final mixing and BAM! Done. We're playing 2 shows soon, Penny Road Pub in Barrington October 5th, and Elbo room in Chicago October 19th. Please come out!"

Like last night I had a dream Sarah died. I was searching all over the hospital for her with Tom. Cathy was at home waiting to hear what happened. So we find her and the doctor tell us she has some disease. And shes not gonna make it and we cant see her or we will get sick too. So she ends up dying it what seems like a matter of minutes. And we end up calling Cathy and telling her what happened. Then I end up taking a train alone to some town that is built vertically and theres stairs and elevators everywhere is like the town was built going up into the mountains. Thats all I remember. 

Let Down is recording in July. I'm excited. We're playing 2 shows in a row July 17 at the Elbow Room in Chicago, and 18th at Mothers in Chicago. We really need to have people come to The Elbow room because if you don't have a lot of people come they send out a newsletter to other places bands play in Chicago and you're on a list of bands who don't have people show up. Which is basically blackballing your band. 

Checkout The Band ""1997"", they're so fucking good. It's sick. Too bad they kicked the original girl singer out of the band even before it came out. 

I'm amazed at how people can just throw talent away."

I talked to my friend Dan on the phone for a while the other night. We don't talk much anymore for whatever reason. I realize I don't like talking to people when they are drunk and I don't realize it until the conversation is almost over and then I start piecing together parts of the conversation that made me angry. Like when he said ""you have a bullshit drum set."" That pissed me off, and I thought, are my drums shitty? I mean I didn't get the fucking super expensive set, and I've had them for like 7 years. But I take care of them, and with all the shit I have it probably ran me between 1500 and 2000 dollars total. Whatever, I like the way they sound, you don't have to go waste an unholy amount on an instrument when you're just to be playing in your garage or basement. 

And he has always liked to make it seem like I am so much more well off than him, and that I've got it better, but the thing is, I fucking work for the shit want and I have. Not to sound like ""I'm so great"" but if I want something, I fucking work for it, and I fucking get it. I want a car, then I'm gonna work till I can afford it, everything I have. I wanted an Eclipse, so I went and got one, I wanted a faster one, so I made a deal with Melissa's uncle, and I got it. I want a Lancer Evolution, I went to the dealership 3 times and got it. I want a house, thats my next goal, and guess what, I'm gonna fucking get it. So don't tell me I have it so much better off. I'm sticking out being a Plumber even though I would rather be doing a million other things, so I can make money and get what I want.  I'm so busy all the time, working on the Halo website, doing shit with my band, work, I'm making my life work the way I want it. 

I'm going to be a Plumber until something else starts working good enough to take over. I want to tour the fucking world with my band. Vote for us to play Warped. (www.battleofthebands.com/letdown) I want to do what Tom does, and work from home. I want enough security with money that I can travel all around the world and not worry about anything. So I'm gonna do my fucking best to make that happen.

"event","The G-Pig Melissa and I adopted back in the day, has died. Little Kiki. This sucks, it odd how attached I have become to all the G-Pigs. It's like a nightmare, you stare at its little body praying it will wake up, that it's only asleep. 

At about 4:30 am the morning after I find my little Kiki gone, I wake up from my sleep on a mattress on the floor in the basement feeling sick. About a half hour of laying there thinking, don't be sick, don't move, don't throw up. 5am. This is it. I wake up, push the blankets back, theres no where to go, I have about 15 seconds to think, I can run upstairs, I wont make it, Is there a bucket around? Anything? Running to the sump pump pit crosses my mind, but I disregarded that option after I thought about my puke being sucked up and sprayed out all over the lawn. And if you're sick, it's always good to have evidence  of puke, so everyone doesn't think you're faking it. I put my head down, and throw up on the mattress. (The only mattress that doesn't destroy my back, this will come into play later). I'm not sure I have ever thrown up so much in my life. It felt like I just kept going. I knew what it was too. Hamburger Helper. Not even the real kind, the packet easy hamburger helper kind. So after about god knows how long, I start to get up, the mattress is fucked. One leg of my pajama pants was soaked. Left those in the basement, and went upstairs, put new pants on and informed my mom that I had been barfing. 

Now after sleeping, in my upstairs bed, that is HORRIBLE, like all day. My back is killing me, so bad, that at 3:30am last night, I ordered a new 2044 dollar sleep number bed online. You know the one where you control the firmness with a little remote.  All I know is it will be worth it

Thanks for listening.

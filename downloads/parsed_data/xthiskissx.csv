the last time that i let you.
and this akward kiss
that tells of others peoples lips
will be of service
to keepin you away...~dashboard..*best deceptions*

*well i havent writtin in these in awhile, and God knows that theres been a lotta shit goin on..

and the bad news..
*just found out my aunt has breast cancer..
*guys are assholes..
*losin one of my bestfriends, and im scared of that
* ----- is bein such an asshole to ------ and theses nuthin i can do about it...
*i know 2 people that like me..but i donno what to do bout that one..
*i need to go shopping...
*i wish i woulda said yes to him about prom..
*aau basketball sucks a big one..

the good news..
*im over him:) yay for that one!
*ive become really good friends with some really cool people
*i have one friend i know ill never lose
*this weekends gonna kick ass..
*i most def wont be grounded:)
*my parents are outta town for 6 weeks..heck yea..

ive learned something about myself this year..i useta be the person everyone walked all over, and im gettin better everyday about that one..thanks richel-love you! and i know i prolly shouldnt be as nice to him as i was and am..but i guess thats just what happens when no matter how much you try to hate someone, if theres somethin really there, its not possible..so i guess thats bittersweet itself.. lol reminds me of the convo last saturday..-oxy morons.. 

im also proud that i can actually admit ive done somethin wrong when people blame me for things, but they cant take responsibilities for whatever they did..coughcough this summer.. when i mess up atleast i can admit it

so richel and i have been thinkin bout these emo kids..who can stay depressed that long? i dont understand that.. if anythin right now its happy people..thats why i donno if i should be with *you*..

so i went over to tracys today which was awesome cause we havent hung out just us in forever..shes a cool kid, i love you! *handlebars..* lol that just gets funnier every time..

well i won my tennis matches this week..which was kick a..and as much as people joke around about me playin tennis it really is about the best sport ever..aced my girl 5 times thanks:) and man i love it..unlike basketball practice..which i needa start goin to more or i wont be playin any.. this weekend sarah and jama both wont be there (our startin posts) and so me n mandy will be doin some kick a postin..(o yea..) and then yea so i am in love with ***** **** hahaha, not really, but man he called the backseat.. ahhh~ (lol shell)

o another interesting thing happened today..ruben russell called me an annerexic whore? i was like..yea thats me..every thursday (lol kelly) and i just told him to go make a pinyata.. kinda mean, but i dont care..

well i guess ive said enough..gotta call my line of people i call every night.. and thanks matt for never callin me lately.. hahhaha disconnection maybe (lmao laura).. 

i made a lotta people laugh today.. lol today was a good day for ellens funnies..

well i just got done drivin with theadore..whata cool kid.. he told me to go 60 down montvale..so i did, and it was hardcore man..and we didnt die..always a plus


*i wish i could save all the tears ive cried over the things youve done to me..so i could drown you in them..~across three novembers..."

"event","Originally posted by <lj user=""gabrielleabelle"" /> at <a href=""http://gabrielleabelle.livejournal.com/339685.html"">Mississippi Personhood Amendment</a><div class=""repost"">Okay, so I don't usually do this, but this is an issue near and dear to me and this is getting <s>very little</s> no attention in the mainstream media.

Mississippi is voting on November 8th on whether to pass Amendment 26, the ""Personhood Amendment"". This amendment would grant fertilized eggs and fetuses personhood status.

Putting aside the contentious issue of abortion, this would effectively outlaw birth control and criminalize women who have miscarriages. This is not a good thing. 

<a href=""http://www.jacksonwomenshealth.com/"">Jackson Women's Health Organization</a> is the only place women can get abortions in the <i>entire</i> state, and they are trying to launch a grassroots movement against this amendment. This doesn't just apply to Mississippi, though, as Personhood USA, the group that introduced this amendment, is trying to introduce identical amendments in <i>all 50 states</i>.

What's more, in Mississippi, this amendment is expected to pass. It even has Mississippi Democrats, including the Attorney General, Jim Hood, backing it.

The reason I'm posting this here is because I made a meager donation to the Jackson Women's Health Organization this morning, and I received a personal email back hours later - on a Sunday - thanking me and noting that I'm one of the first ""outside"" people to contribute.

So if you sometimes pass on political action because you figure that enough other people will do something to make a difference, make an exception on this one. My RSS reader is near silent on this amendment. I only found out about it through a feminist blog. The mainstream media is not reporting on it.

If there is ever a time to donate or send a letter in protest, this would be it.

What to do?

- Read up on it. <a href=""http://www.wakeupmississippi.org/"">Wake Up, Mississippi</a> is the home of the grassroots effort to fight this amendment. <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/10/07/1023558/-Occupy-My-Uterus-My-Ass!-Fertilized-Eggs-Are-NOT-People!"">Daily Kos</a> also has a thorough story on it.

- If you can afford it, you can donate at the site's link.

- You can <a href=""http://www.democrats.org/contact"">contact the Democratic National Committee</a> to see why more of our representatives aren't speaking out against this.

- Like <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/WakeUpMississippiorg/237684486281516"">this Facebook page</a> to help spread awareness.

"event","Just wanted to keep you in the loop. Looks like Good will start screening on Thursday 23 April. A cinema in Camberwell had some preview screenings last week. I'll contact them on  Tuesday 22 April to confirm the session times then book my flights and stuff. I'll let you know when and where we'll be meeting (probably on the bridge over the railway at Camberwell as one of the girls from Magnificent Percy lives nearby and we always get together at her place.

Catch up with you soon.

Take care.

Hooroo,
Carole"

"event","Here's a nice interview with the Director, Vincente Amorim about working with Jason and Viggo on ""Good"" from This is Croydon. 
 
http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/showbiz/Viggo-Jason-best-actors/arti_cle-315960-detail/article.html 
 
Here's another one from ""Hello"" Magazine. 
 
http://www.hellomagazine.com/film/2008/09/09/jason-issacs-toronto/ 
 
And a lovely pic accompanying it.
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v128/crawfoc99/Good/TIFF05.jpg


And yet, another article about Viggo and Jodie Whittaker from CTV.ca. Very little about Jason in it. 
 
http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080909/tiff_good_080909/20080909?s_name=tiff2008&no_ads=
 
Here's a snippet from Comingsoon.net which is quite complimentary to Jason's performance. 
 
There are a couple of movies playing this year that might be seen as derivative due to their genre but feature such good writing and great performances that it's hard not to take them seriously. Viggo Mortensen is getting a lot of attention for the number of movies he's appearing in this fall after his Oscar nomination last year, but the better of his two at TIFF is Good (THINKFilm - Dec. '0, a drama based on the play by C.P. Taylor, about a German literature professor whose fiction novel is embraced by the Third Reich during their early days, allowing him to live luxuriously even as his marriage falls apart. Viggo is very good in this but it's the performance by Jason Isaacs as his long-time friend and colleague, an affluent Jewish scholar whose life crumbles as his friend's star is on the ascendant, that leaves a lasting impression. (And I'm not just saying that because I learned that Isaacs often reads ComingSoon.net!) 

And a nice video on Youtube (mainly Viggo) but you do see some Jason.

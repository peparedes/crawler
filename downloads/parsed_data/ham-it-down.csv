I seriously thought that the newly developed closure from last night had given me a fresh breath of air and I was ready to keep moving.. and then I saw him. Now I'm back to being frustrated and I can't talk about it to anyone cause I talk about it way to much and everyone I know is sick of hearing about it... 

I just dont understand how you can like someone, but not want to pursue it to the point where you are going to disapear from that person to deal with not having them anymore. What is going on? I can't remember the last time I had to the strength to walk away from someone I really liked and say "" I just can't do that right now"" I always made it work. Then come the horrible thoughts: I'm not good enough for that much effort... I know that't not true it just seems so true at this point. SERIOUSLY why can't I be emotionless?

I do need to concentrate on school and getting into shape though. So maybe those two combined can help me get over this hump. It's not even hump day and I'm already dragging. It's beacause it's a Monday.

"event","So yeah.. every girl who's reading this has probably completely digested or been told lines from this book; ""He's Just Not That Into You."" I was the skeptical one... no I'm not going to read that. It's just people complaining about how relationships dont work and lifes hard.. yeah duh where have you been... the I picked it up.

Sadly it applied to many situations I have been including the current. He's just not that into you if he's not asking you out. It hit hard when it said: ""I dont want a serious relationship means I dont want a serious relatinoship means I dont want a serious relationship"" Any hope of fear of doubt gone completley. He said it, he meant it. He's not afraid, he just knows what he doesn't want: me.

Seriously how confusing can you be.. UNBELIEVABLE. And why cant I move on. Please.. when someone tells you that the dont want a bf/gf, you just get over it and move on right. WRONG not when they call everyday and hang out with you everyday.. freaking what is going on. Basically whats going on is my stupidity.. but I just dont want it to change. I dont need a title. I love hanging out with him, he makes me feel gorgeous and gives me self confidence. So, why do I need a title?

BECAUSE no matter how hard you try, you will always get attached and then you will need some reasurrance that something is there and their is meaning to what you are putting your heart into. Yeah I know what you are thinking.. why doesn't she just take her own advice.

My life really isn't that interesting and I definatly am not a woman of big words.. so therefore I always feel as if I am wasting ya'll's(not a word) time by posting.. but I am at my Grandparents and I have been here for so long I have ABSOLUTLY nothing else to do.

Christmas Break: Not what I thought it was going to be. I didn't get to see half the people that I was itching to speak with. I felt utterly out of place. I almost fell asleep during the sermon.

Road Trip to ATL: If you ever spent eight and a half hours or more in the car with my family you would understand why I am the way I am. But, it was somewhat eventful anyway and the good part was that my Mimi met me at the door with fresh New Year's cookies. Beautiful.

School: Can't wait to get back. No matter how much I think that sometimes I am going to lose it, I love it. I wouldn't trade it for the world. Did pretty well on my grades, made Dean's List at least. But, the people. I just can't get over how different the people are. I love them. We all know why they are different, because I live in THE SOUTH! 

I miss you all so much. If I didn't get to see you over Christmas, I wanted to but I was only home for a week and a few days. Happy New Year's to everyone... be safe, I'll try to sometimes I can get a little crazy sitting on the couch watching movies with my 90 yr old Grandmother..watch out ATL here we come."

Whatever happened to a good pencil and paper. My math class, the one thing you would think would still require a notebook of somekind, is TOTALLY on computer.

I hate heals they make me taller than the mas population of males at this school. That is right I have realized that a lot of guys in Alabama are incredibly short. Oh well, maybe I am just too tall.

I know I haven't updated in a long time, but I miss all of you guys sooo much. I read your posts and it makes me sad that I don't get to experience those things with you. But, on the other hand I LOVE IT HERE! It has become one of my favorite places to be. I went out of town last weekend due to Ivan and payed my lovely grandparents a little visit in Atlanta. I swear I wasn't two hours away and I missed it and wanted to come back. I am sooo happy and that is a relief because I was doubting it for a while. But that doesn't mean I don't miss all of you guys!"

                   A POET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The very first time I saw you,
Was special how we met.
You took me by complete surprise,
I knew my heart was set.

As days flew by, we talked again,
but you never seemed to care.
I tried my best to help you out,
By a favor here, or a favor there.

Although I made a fast approach,
Our friendship grew and grew.
I realized how deep I cared,
But the feeling I felt was new.

In time I became attached to you,
From a hug, I wouldn't let go.
I soon saw how close we were,
And the feeling was good to know.

For you, I wrote sweet letters and poems,
You were on my mind all day.
The thought of sleeping was nowhere near,
Unless I knew you were okay.

It hit me then, what I was in-
A unique and precious love.
For the person I said was only mine,
Was an angel sent from above.

The minutes without you turned to days,
And the seconds with you flew fast.
I could only hope to see you more,
And make each moment last.

The times I spent with you,
Were what made my heart complete.
I know one thing for sure,
Without you my future was obsolete.

And now we love just the same,
As it doubles day by day.
I stare deep into your precious eyes,
Yet I'm still speechless to what I should say. 

With you, I'm in a whole new world,
You bring out the best in me.
It's hard to picture you not there,
When you taught me who to be.

Yes, the road ahead gets hard,
When things may only seem rough.
But because you and I try so much,
We'll stay strong and get by tough.

Though problems may lie ahead someday,
And either of us could be right;
I promise to always be by your side,
And I promise my heart, so hold it tight.

And so, each night beside my bed,
When there's only bright stars to see.
I pray that we may never give up,
And will always remain you and me.

"event","I think it is finally over... although it is a step by step journey that I am still on, but I have conquered the first step.... 

           It felt so good to walk by him with my head held high knowing that I was with someone who treats me a hundred percent better and who I am truly meant to be with at this time. I didn't desire a relationship with him anymore, in fact I wanted to get out of there as quick as I could. It is the first time in a while that I have felt confident in front of him and it felt great. 

Many people think that the reason I hated him was because I liked him... kinda like a love- hate, obsession- but not pursuit relationship. But what I haven't told anyone, except one who listens to me when I rant although he isn't forced, is that the true reason I hated him so much was the way he made me feel about myself. And joking about it and making fun of him somewhat covered up how I truly felt. I felt so used... he made me feel as if I wasn't good enough, I didn't match up. Well, I've felt that way for a long time, and tonight... that feeling is gone.

Im the one who is an amazing relationship and have friends who truly care about me and dont' like me just because the want to be seen with me or use me for things that I have. I may not be as pretty as his expectations, or as smart as he is, but gosh darnett when it comes down to it I AM BETTER and he is the one that ISN""T GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!

So there, its out of my system.. step one is finished, and now it is on to step two which would be gaining the self confidence to know that I need not live up to anyones expectations but my own, I shall be my own critic, and not allow the pessimistic world to affect me in my demeanor.

Thank you to everyone who made my night as special as it was....

Zach: for being a great friend first, but also a wonderful boyfriend.
Heather and Matt: for providing laughter at times of need, especially times of stress or uncomfort.
Mais: for putting up with everyones crap and putting this whole thing together, what would we do without you.
Ham: for opening up your house for us when we needed a place to be.. it was great
Amanda: for as well opening up your house, although I didn't have thehonor of staying there, I've heard it was great.

I love the feeling of happiness where you can be yourself no matter who you are with and especially with certain people.

If anyone wants to know the story, feel free to ask, but I am not going to type it up.

Well, homecoming just around the corner.. Have I mentioned how ridiculously expensive things are these days.. gosh darn if a bowl of soup on sanibel isn't like fifteen bucks... but it promises to be a great one.

I just don't know what to do with myself.

I thirst for understanding... understanding of a world where someone can appear so happy on the outside, yet be broken and craving unfathomable things on the inside. A world where their is a common belief in a God who created this earth and who we shall rejoin by belief in the after life, yet people all around are suffering and their is a commom miscommunication.

How insignifigant a scene as that makes one feel.... but it is so wonderful to imagine that there are so many people and therefore so many possibilities. So magical to think about how lives flip and flop from good times to bad and home irony plays such a huge role in it all. 

How one minute one person can be searching for the one thing the need and be surrounded by mulitiple persons blessed with that one thing at the time..... and then out of the middle or nowhere, completely unexpected you are surprised by the sway in your life from hoping and wanting to having and holding on to. Yet someone who was blessed with what one ached for was no robbed or their good fortune and left in the dust, depressed and searching for a path to follow. Life is cruel and yet so rewarding.

But the key is that those who were around such a person and were blessed with what the person wasn't as well as the person themselves are their to support each other through these ups and downs, complementing each other time and time again.

Someone was talking to me tonight about in a relationship... the opposite partner attempting to change them from who they truly were and in a sense I think that is somewhat the same thing as changing Calvin's name. Although it is possible, the object will never be the same once it is expected to respond to a completely different message.

Acceptance of people for who they truly are is something I believe everyone struggles with and some people are more talented in the task than others. But if you attempt to judge someone or get to know them only through the outermost layer, a true relationship can never be prolonged or extensivly enjoyed... interesting to think about."

I'm not sure if it's serious or not, but it could be, so I am asking everyone to just keep him in your prayers, it would mean alot to me.  Thanks, I love you all.

"event","I was talking to someone yesterday about two different types of people when it comes to dating... one who can move from person to person almost instantly and then those who seem to hang on to the same one for a lengthy period of time. 
       I find it almost unbelieveable how some people jump from crush to crush in such small periods of time.. but I am sure they have their bases of liking. 

Love came up next... how complicated and entrapping it is almost to a point where one's mind is useless and all that is used to decipher good from bad and right from wrong is the heart. Then there are those people who hide from it in fear of getting hurt... when you have had the good, the bad almost seems bearable just for the slightest chance that you might stumble upon the good. 

So tomorrow night is sports night... can't wait to beat Zach and Travis in basketball.. everyone wants to play the girl... we'll see.

Last few weeks have been really good... I am experiencing something I haven't had in a while, at least not with the same circumstances, and I really like it. This summer has been wonderful, although there has been mass amounts of drama, I think many of us would agree it was worth it to get to where we are now, and also where we will be when school starts.

Heather is in orlanda, matt just left for michigan and wherever else that family was going, I am in atlanta Mais is in chicago, and Amanda leaves for OK on friday. Thats crazy! Well to all you devoted workers, hats of to ya for sticking with it and getting the money you deserve.

I think I might actually have found what I want to major in and I think I have narrowed my colleges down to an odd five. This fact is amazing because never would I have thought as of a couple weeks ago that my mind would have been made up but it is like a sudden peace has settled and everything is much clearer now. Weird.

My uncle told me today that twenty eight days later is actually a very good movie and while it isn't as scary as anticipated, it has its moments and really makes you think. I am pondering whether or not to go see it or wait til it comes out on tape... hmmmm I don't know

Jenn- I luv ya babe and I miss ya. I just thought of something that I wanted to talk to you about so don't let me forget when I am back. We will have to go somewhere interesting and you can listen to me babble.. I know you love it!"

Anyways, I'm up at my g parents house and I am pretty darn bored.. don't know what to do with my time so I am watching a little tennis and playing with ALL the babies. They are everywhere! I'm upset I don't get to hang out with ya'll on the fourth, I will be up at the club, dining with the family and then babysitting as the ""adults"" go out for drinks. Should be tons of fun! 

I really don't understand why people make such a big deal out of little things that truly are unimportant. But I guess it all has to do with the complexity of the brain and the differences in everyones. We all think and therefore reason differently, and I guess that explains the differance in rationals. 

Can't wait til this weekend girls! Our plan is awesome and I can't wait. We are going to have tons of fun but hush hush because it is a secret and only a few of us know bout it!

Mais, have a wonderful trip in Chicago! Be a good girl if you know what I mean, but have fun. 

I'll see you guys on Saturday when I return.... have a wonderful fourth!"

I have found humans are the exact same way. While you can have a predetermined opinion about a group of people formed on the basis of experiences with a few examples of that species, all it takes is one good encounter that can change things around. It just teaches the lesson, DON""T GENERALIZE

We all hung out at heathers condo again last night. Got up this morning to take taylor to school with woods, and after a great experience at the bagel factory, we watched the new real world. I have never seen a more shallow and loveless person as adam( big black fro) Some things he said were extremely hurtful and Heather and I were thoroughly disgusted by it. 

SATs on saturday, and while I am not nervous, I know a lot rely upon them. I have a decent score that can get me into good schools, but with just a couple more scores, my options would rise beyond my imagination. I just hope I do better than last time, any improvement would be good. 

As I began the entry with a reference to animals I will close it in the same way. I love dogs. If people lived and acted like dogs, the whole world would be a more peaceful place. What a great specie.... SO MUCH BETTER THAN CATS!"

"event","Well, we all went to see a movie last night, identity, and I have been thinking really deeply since for some odd reason. Although I made it a goal not to do that again for a while, its definatly happening these few days. I have come to the conclusion that I really haven't been myself lately. Doing things that in my previous years I would have denied and stayed home with my pupps and watched a movie. While I have found some satisfaction in these actions, it seems to all be crumbling as my true dedications come back to me and I realize what my goals in life are and the true person that I am. For some reason I feel fake right now and I can't explain it. 

On other terms... it seems everyone around me is dating someone. No matter where I turn I am bombarded by couples and I just can't take it being that my love life lies stagnant in the water and seems to have no hope. But, this summer seems promising. JAMAICA IN TWO WEEKS! I can't believe it and I really don't think I will realize I am going until I get there. Then comes numerous basketball ordeals and fun in the son. All of which I can't wait to experience. This summer I believe is a redemption period, I think I lost myself in the fourth quarter and am on a quest to find her again! 

Lacey.. I can't go to frisbee, I am sorry. My dad and I got in a fight and I am just not up to anything tomorrow. But thank you so much for thinking about me. We will have to do something this weekend. I miss you guys... I am sorry for my abscense, but thanks for hanging with me, and don't worry Lo, I have many devoted, true friends, and you guys are definatly prominant in that group! 

Thanks for listening to me babble. Have a wonderful weekend. Jon, happy birfday and have a great party. Thank you for the invitation, but I don't think I can make it.. I am pretty sure I am being roped into babysitting. I hope everyone has a great weekend and if you find something to do that doesn't involve spending money, call me!

Anyways, continue if you wish but for everyone's sake if all you are going to do is waste our live journal space why don't you come up to me and say it to my face instead of hiding behind your computer screen. Oh goodness, this is just a huge joke. Amanda was really concerned, she said she had never heard such horrible comments in her life, and the funny thing is, they really didn't affect me at all.

I am so sick of this damn town and all the damn drama loving people in it. I wish everyone could mind their own buisness instead of wanting to know every single detail about everyone. Lately I have been questioning who my true friends are and which ones just turn me on and off when they feel the need. They've definatly been deciferd. The guys were saying tonight that we as girls fight way to often and they are right. It is really sad that we all can't get along like they do, and I really truly believe it is because so people aren't in for the whole treck.. what I mean is they aren't devoted to the others like they should be... I don't know I have so much anger right now and I am really trying to find a place for it. That place at this moment is right here.

To those of you who truly care and are truly my friends, thank you and I am sorry that I have been so down and out lately, i just can't describe the corruption in my life. And to those I haven't been a true friend to, I am apologetic for my selfishness... I should have been there when you needed me, but instead I kept my distance, and now you think I don't care. I do care... I am truly sorry.

#1 annoyance... when people don't know their place.
This can take a lot of angles, but lately it has been people not being aware of the way they hurt others throught the simple things they do everyday. How can I be soo mad at a person and they not even be aware of the fact... I mean you have to be oblivious. Take a look around and actually recognize how your actions are affecting other people.. selfishness is the work of evil."

So after a meal at perkins along with morg, we took matthew home, as he stumbled into the garage, and headed on home. The funny thing is last night was the greatest night and I just can't describe it so just take my word for it. Well, earlier in the day.. we were dicked over by the non-prom guys as they were really rude on the phone... zach and matt, so we decided to pay elya a little visit last night at TWO IN THE MORNING! That's right, we are now in possesion of his loved Michigan hat and long sleeve shirt. Little does he know but no one wil be writing on his plaque anymore because woods took the pen!! haha HOUSE RAID! No no they will be returned we just had a mission list, and his finch shirt was on it.... so the mission is still incomplete. Other than that it sounds like pretty much everyone had a great time at prom and that is wonderful! I am glad everyone had  good night! So as I sit here on Wood's yoga ball, I am pondering many many things..

hmmm lucky charms are awesome, ashton kutcher is hot, cliff is my new favorite friend's dog, and damn the ap test cause we need to go look over our notes. 

brandon distefano has a dirty mouth.. it was wonderful to wake up to your message this morning brandon!!! I don't know what the hell it was for, but we sure as hell weren't with anyone who called you last night! We weren't that BORED, its no like we would go ride around in limos dressed in street clothes and try to pick up fort myers girls basetball players! and then show up at prom even though you didn't buy a ticket and you just wanted to be there... SAD!

I finally woke up and smelled the coffee and realized that there are a lot more important things in life than my trivial problems. The fact that I can go on and on blabbering about things that truly are not that big of a deal is sickening to my stomach and I want to thank you Coyle for listening to me... next time just slap me out of it. 

Marty... you're live journal entry was truly passionate and moving. I have so much respect for you and I am sorry for your loss, but the fact that the last words to you father were those of evangilism just warms my heart. Possibly, because of you, a man who was not on the path of eternal life was driven back onto it due to your knowledge and the ability to share it. I want to thank you for being a great role model for all of us. I wish you the best in the future.

So I dont' know what I am goign to do especially if he drives by tomorrow as I am walking in. Ahhh this confusion if just stressing me out and the last thing I need is extra stress.. for whoever left that commment on my last entry, thank you. It meant a lot.

For the last and final time... I AM NOT GOING TO PROM. If anyone else asks me that question I am going to scream. I dont' understand why it is such a big deal that I am not going. I mean I know Mais,that you just wanted me to go, and this is not directed at you.. but for those of you who repetedly ask for explanation I really am just going to walk away. To those of you who are going... I hope you have a wonderful time and I want to hear all about it.. hell I'll probably see you afterwards anyway.

I am really glad that I dont' have to spend any of this week in the car for more than fifteen minutes. I have traveled so many road miles in the past week I can't even comprehend it. And I wasted my spring break because I am still albino(not that it will every change even with sun) and I really missed my friends while I was gone. That is the one plus about school tomorrow, I get to see everyone.. Let's try to be positive guys, instead of wahhh i don't want to go, how about SWEET only five weeks left and then only one year until we are out of this hell hole!

YES and then I have to go see my cousins, which isn't entirly a bad thing being that my cousin has really good looking friends. I have traveled in the car so much lately I can't remeber the last time I spent two sequential nights in my own bed. But all the road miles have given me a chance to think about things, and also hearing jenns decision to tell him how she feels has also influenced me. I just am really scared of rejection. I think that is what it truly boils down to and also the fact that I truly believe that he will reject me, whether its due to non- attraction or fear and nievity. I just don't know what to do and I have never been the type to approach the opposite sex, I am usually the one who waits on the invitation. But I just think of how great things could be if he recipricated my feelings and that really motivates me to tell him. I think it will happen like this... one day when I am driving to Amandas, if he is outside, I am just going to throw the car into park, get out, and spill the beans. I dont' know if I will have the strength to wait for a reaction, but I think I just need to get it over with and stop dwelling on the ""ifs."" Lots of people are mistaken when they guess who I am talking about, so if you think you know, you probably have no idea whatsoever. It is someone no one that knows me ""kinda"" would expect, but also someome that one who knows me well could have detected a while ago. Anyways, I need your opinions guys.. and if you really want to know who it is, just ask.

I saw Mairin on Wednesday.. she is back in town this week for a visit and it was so great to see her. She looked just splendid and it was pure fate that I saw here when I did because I was leaving the next day. I am so proud of her and how she is tackling everything that is thrown her way. She is a true role model and I hold so much respect for her I can't even descibe it. I love ya Reardon!

My dad made a comment to me the other day when I was at duke that secretly really upset me but I didn't show him that it did. As I was standing on the campus, he looked at me and said, honey, you are out of place.. at first I thought he was talking about the fact that every other visitor present had already been accepted and I hadn't even applied and then he said.."" you know what they call a blond girl on duke's campus?..... a visitor!(chuckle chuckle) While I know he was just giving me a hard time, I began to look around and notice that I was literally the only blond in the quad. While I am not stereotyping my own kind, it just kinda pushed my buttons to think that someone could have been looking at me and thinking, ""what is that blond doing here"" I dont' know, maybe I am making a big deal out of nothing, but I would say it is rather disturbing. 

I hope everyone has a wonderful easter! I am so glad I am able to spend it where it is somewhat chilly do to my hot natured self. Jenn, I hope your mother gets well soon and she is definatly in my prayers. Mais, just relax and don' t feel the need to do something every second of the day. Enjoy watching cartoons while you are able! Calso, about the chat we had the other night, I dont know how you responded to it, with actions, words, or neither, but don't stress, if you choose to tell her, she will understand. Jess Whelan at Cypress... no Jess, don't leave us! Finally, Sabrina, I am glad that you have found such a good relationship with Eric and I promise not everyone is a lies to you, there are many trustworthy people in the world."

"event","What a screwed up night.. First of all the day went by pretty fast with plios at 9 and captains lunch at 1245, I headed over to mandas at the request of mais and manda to see what kind of progress the prom comittee was making. I guess I really slowed them down because they did a lot of work before I got there but I kinda set them off track with the invitation to the guys who proceeded to drink skittle water and play basketball in the pool. Then when we decide to go out to Morgan's restraunt all hell breaks loose. Not only do the boys break the water line in the back of the restraunt, but they also decided not to eat and to go raid some party at the beach. After that it ended up me, mais, manda, and calso at taco bell with pot fumes in the air to order chulupas! I don't know whats wrong with me but I really just didn't enjoy myself tonight. It wasn't the people, I adore those who surrounded me, but something is out of place. 

Today Marty asked me the question which seems to echo out of every person's mouth which I come in contact with.. Are you going to prom? why not? hell even my friend from chattanooga asked, it's a conspiracy. No I am not going because there was only one person whom I wanted to ask me and he didn't so there's the deciding factor. Maybe that's what is wrong with me.. I dont' know all I am aware of is that I need to get over this guy because he obviously doesn't have mutual feelings. Hopefully my trip to the motherland this weekend will wash away my troubles and leave me refreshed for the end of school. 

All I desire is for the summer to come.. Jamaica, fun in the son, trips to the mountains, people I haven't seen in a long time... It is all about the summer and I am just bracing myself to get through the rest of school to be able to sprint out of school and head straight for the airport. 

Remember everyone... Dawson's Creek every week morning at 8 until 11, dont' miss the early seasons.. they were the best!"

"event","Wow now that I have regained sense and I am calm I will actually wrtie something decent. What a horrible week, Elya and I decided before it started it was going to be bad, but little did we know. I am really glad it is almost over but it is ending on a good note. Not only for the first time in a while is everyone getting along, but it is just in time for relay. I get to see Matt Campbell tomorrow and I am thrilled, a year and a half is a long time. But the downside is, as prom pushes closer and closer the pressure for me to ask him gets worse and worse... for me and my ego's sake I really would prefer not to do the asking, but I just am at fault with reading him. If I believed what I felt I would think he was sending me signals... but then again why didn't he initiate the conversation last night. Why didn't either of us? So many questions and no answers. He was so close, yet so far away, right behind my car and all I could do was look at him through the review and wonder what it would be like to be with him or even to be his aquaintance. I know I am getting gushy livejournally, but the situation really hurts me because I don't see it getting any better any time soon. I hope he goes to relay, but then again he probably has a tournament or something, who knows he does everything. I listened to finch for the first time today thanks to elya's burning ability, and I was somewhat disapointed that I wasn't infatuated with them.. you would think two who shared names would be more alike than most, but Nate's screaming at random points in the song doesnt' agree with my ears.Time for beddy bye, only three periods tomorrow and then I am out of there for a mass amount of time! Can't wait to go back home, it will feel so nice to be welcomed again. For those of you who have never experienced the true south, you should come home with me, wow I love it. As they say down yonder in my lovely southern states.. nighty night, sleep tight, dont' let the bed WORMS bight! haha night ya'll"

"event","I really dont' know how to describe this feeling.. I was playing basketball up at the courts on 41, on my home and my mom calls to inform me that he called and is planning on calling back at approx. 845. Well as you all can tell it is now 911 and I am really nervous.. will he call? what will he say? what if he doesn't? i wont see him again and it will be what now two years? gosh i just hate this feeling.. But if he does call I will probably leave after third.. oh lord, he just called and we lost the connection, this is killing me.. time to deal with the damn phone.. relay is here, everyone have fun!"

"event","I have a tourney this weekend and I am thoroughly upset I will miss the beach day. I really enjoyed it last week, but that's ok I shall be there in spirit. I really don' t have that much to say tonight I am just goning to go play my guitar.. maybe that will sooth my worries. I just don't understand all the anger. Please again I will ask, don't comment on my journal if it isn't positive. I don't want to read those kind of comments in my email. Its just plain rude of whoever is doing it to continure after I have pleaded with you to stop. I don't know what I have done to anger you but maybe you should attempt to tell me instead of just exploiting me with dirty words. I hope EVERYONE has a good weekend. Be safe and don't do anything stupid aye?"

"event","I napped today for four hours.. I never take naps and I don't know what is the matter with me. I guess the sick factor could play a part in the sleepiness, but I was just all punked out. Heather, Tienstra, Kat and I had a great time picking up trash on Summerlin today. You'd be surprised at how great of conversations you can have between two orange vest wearing NHS members on a median surrounded by cars going mass quantities of speeds. Tomorrow is going to be a beast of a day.. english explication first period, ap test, and algebra test... what a great day. But then again it is thursday. Well... it isn't lookin hopeful for all of you (Mais, Manda, Heather, Coyle) who wanted me to go to prom. I am thinking right now that it would be in the best interest of myself if I stayed away from the heels and frillies. Not only is my love life about the most screwed up thing on the planet at this moment.. I just don't think I can deal with anything else right now. My good friend is visiting me next week and I am hoping he can be my escape from this stressful place I am stuck in. I have a tourney this weekend and I really don't have the energy to play at all and definatly not enought to lead the team. Well, I saw him twice today, and for some reason my stomach didn't turn like it used to. I am not sure what that means.. that I don't truly like him or that I am just sick of his obliviance to me. It seems almost not worth my time and effort if he is just going to ignore what I do and focus on himself all of the time. I believe it is time to move on.. but this transition I believe will be to an acceptance of independence for a while. Unless someone falls right in front of me I don't believe I have the energy to pursue anyone else.. I guees I'll just let the world turn and let myself turn right along with it.. can't be that bad right?"

"event","Gosh darnett.. I am at a lost for words. Everything that is going on is so immature and stupid its just ridiculous. Please for the sake of other's sanity.. if you don't have any productive comments then don't write them on live journal. Some of the one's recently have been truly sick and if you truly feel that way I am sorry but we need to work this all out instead of just continually putting threats online. This is the last I am going to say about any of it.. but if you have some ridiculous comment to make about someone else please leave it off my journal and if you have something to say to me, have the decency to say it to my face so that I can at least either defend myself of talk to you about it and apologize. I am not looking for hatred for anyone or anyone's hatred for myself. I think we all need to grow up and look around.. we all have mutual friends going through things so much more important than our trivial disputes. Mairin, I love you and you keep going strong, we can't wait to see you again. Marty, I respect you so much for your strength and for the courage to share your experience with all of us. We are here for you if you need anything and your father as well as your family are in my prayers. Last saturday at the beach was a wonderful time and the harmony felt between everyone was extremely refreshing. I wish we could all get along like that all the time but for some reason the harmony is always disrupted. I had so much to write about tonight.. and for some damn reason this is what has to take up the space of my journal.. sad isn't it?"

"event","Well so many things are going on its like a flippin hurriane and I can't keep up.. people are mad and some are sad and it is just a mixture of feelings. i myself have been waiting for this time to come for a long time.. my friend matt campbell is coming next week and i am so excited i can't sit still. On other notes... i am so sore i can't move.. literally it hurts for me to be typing.. Mr. Vogulbach and I are going to fight with all this plyametrics he is making me do. Prom really ticks me off... people run around trying to set others up when some just don't want to go i mean is it ok with everyone if i stay home and eat ben and jerrys? I don't know my attitude about it is that i really want to like my date and the relationship should have potential.. not just some random thing to take up a night of my life. Well I just want to wish a happy april fools to everyone... and kelli wants to wish a special one to matt and craig.. have a great week guys!"

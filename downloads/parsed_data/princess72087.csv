"event","hey im so board. i just got my nails done like an hour ago. they are just regular white tips and a pink flower on each ring finger with jewls in it and glittery polish. they are so pretty, its for prom. i was only at the place for a while and a bunch of gurls from my school walked in there too. so everyone is gettin ready. last night i had dance for ever. it was 85 degrees outside too. i was supposed to be at the studio from 4:15-9:30 cuz i teach for two hours ahead of time and then we have finale practice, teen jazz, and then teachers dance practice. so my teacher called me and said that i didn't have to come in and teach so i went roller bladding on the new paths by my house. i went down this really steep hill and it has a sharp turn at the end and i couldn't stop so i just dumped over on the side cuz i knew i was going to fall anyway and i skinned my leg. grrrrr. then i didn't have to be at dance till 6:00. hehehe. and tonight i have ballet at 8:00-9:00 so im just hangin out bored out of my mind with nothing to do. and i was supposed to call mols when i was done gettin my nails done and i did but then she didn't answer and still hasn't called back or watever so o well. i g2g bye.

"event","hey, ok so i didn't type yesterday either. oh well. this sucks cuz there is like only 4 people online and none of which i really want to talk to at the moment. i just made a sub profile. it is way better than a regular one and it is completely free. yay. i just figured out how to do it. im just really slow i guess. cuz a lot of my friends already had one. so today in school was ok. tonight i have dance pictures for my tap costume. i had had pictures for all of my other dances except this one because this costume wasn't finished at the first photo time. im in a pretty good mood. im not really sure wut it is exactly though. o well, just carefree. my sexy boyfriend is probably out playin baseball with his friends right now and then he is goin to grill steak later with them. we were goin to do something but then i have pictures intsead. in need to go get my nails done, and now stephanie says she doesn't have enough money to so i don't want to go by myself. so that sux, i hate goin to the oriental places without a friend cuz they talk all wierd, but they have a place close to me, they do a good job, and it's cheaper than most places. but im done typin for now i got some homework to do still. cya.

(more emotional lately pms) and then when i got home i had already had a sucky day and then my mom starts bitchin at me and then later she and my dad get into a fight and then HE takes everything out on me by yellin and gettin pissy at me 2.then i get all upset.then sarah calls me and tells me bout her problems with jason and i give her advice and we decide to hang out another day so thats cool. so i go to teach dance tonight, and then when i get there i find out that i read the schedule wrong and i really dont have it tonight so my dad gets even more pissed at me. then i get home and am really upset cuz it seems like today i just can't do anything right. then i call doug crying and tell him wut a bad day im having and he just says oh r u ok and its probably partially me (well it was mostly him) and he still doesn't care and wont change his mind. ahhhhhh jerk ass. so i say wutever i dont wanna talk right now i will call you later to say goodnight. then i call mols and she comes over and we talk cuz she had a bad night to. then we both felt much better. she always can cheer me up no matter wut. good thing i have such a great friend like her. luv ya gurl. well im goin to bed.bye.

It wasn't really scary but it was pretty gross. and i hated the ending. but i wont say wut it is incase anyone who reads this still wants to see it. but i still liked it. Mols says i was scared but i really wasn't only after when we were walkin to her car far away from the parkin lot since it was full and it was all dark and stuff and then suddenly she screams wierd like in my ear. that woulda scared me even if i didn't watch the movie. Then there were a bunch of cops outside the theatre when we got out. there was like a dumb fight with like some 7th and 8th graders. it was funny cuz they were so little. hehe. then we saw Elizabeth, Meka, and Nicole at KFC and it turns out one of the kids was Elizabeths brother. and then yesterday (the day i forgot to write) I had to be at the dance studio at 8:30 to teach cuz the younger kids were having an extra practice. but it wasn't so bad cuz when i got there a gurls dad had brought a bunch of crispy cream doughnuts and sunny d so that was good. than later my mom had some dumb stamping party and Jean measured me so she can fix my dance costume that is too big. then i went with doug to the mall of america and there is a new roller coaster thing there so we went on it. then me and doug got dairy queen and ellen was working so we didn't have to pay.she called it a cousin discount wich wuz nice. then i got home later and doug played nintendo with my bro and then we watched a movie down stairs cuz my aunt wuz over. So yeah that was pretty much what happened. im doin something with doug today but i dunno wut yet. and im so excited that we have spring break this whole next week. i plan to hang out with Ellen K. and Sarah M. and Doug, and i want to ask Mols to do something to. cuz we have to hang out or i will miss her too much. she is my M.F.T.4.L. wich is an inside joke that probably no one would get. well i will talk later cuz this is gettin long now. bye.

And tomarrow night i'm gunna hang out with the buhrnshine. it's gunna be fun, it always is even if we do nothin cuz she is so funny and we are really silly together. WEll tonight i went to dougs house again and we had to do some dumb journalism paper that is due tomarrow cuz we are partners for that class. it turned out good but then the gay printer wuz messed up and then the floppy disks weren't workin so now i have to retype it all. then we finished some more mudding and taping in his bedroom that he's refinishing,and then we took a cute cuddley nap together. he is so hott!!!!!

"event","ok so right now i just got home from school and im waitin for some journalism stuff that i had to look up on the internet to print out. Im eatin chocolate chip cookies and drinkin milk. mmmmm. it's good. i could barely wake up this morning and today went by really slow, even though i am in a surprisingly good mood. i only have like an hour to be home b4 i have to go teach 2hours of dance, come home for one hour eat, and then go back to take 2more hours of dance classes. but the second 2 hours are more fun cuz im dancin and not teachin. don't get me wrong i like to teach but sometimes it gets on ur nurves. usually my dad brings me to dance but he is going to be in a meeting today and my mom works late so i had to call buhrnshine (mols) to ask her if she could bring me. She, being the great friend she is, said yes. im greatful to have her as a friend. i felt sorta bad bout callin her to ask but i really didn't have a choice, just cuz it's my responsibility not hers. but i hope she knows that i appreciate it with all my heart. well i cant wait until spring break starts cuz i really need a break from school and this gettin up early stuff. but im gunna go now cuz buhrn will be here in like a half an hour. who knows maybe ill write again later."

So yeah i guess im sposed 2 say wut i did! Well i went over to Doug's house and Jordan W. wuz there helpin him redo his room in the basement. so i waited 4 a while till they were done puttin up the sheet rock and then after Jordan left i helped Doug mud his room. I mudded all of the spots where the nails were and some of the cracks were the sheets meet and Doug mudded some corner bead. I've never done it b4, it wuz kinda fun but messy! Then we just hung out and i got home no longer than like 10 min. ago. it wuz a fun night and i usually talk to Molly online right now but she isn't on. I thought it wuz cool how she (and others of course) can comment on wut i write. i guess that i am kind of addicted to this thing. it's cool to get your thoughts all into order. well im sure i wont write in it as much as i did today, but it's my 1st time and usually i have dance and homework and stuff. well im still not tired but i will try to go off and sleep now. night."

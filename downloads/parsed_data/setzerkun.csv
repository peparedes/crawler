"event","To begin with, I found Gogo wandering around the desert. Something in me awoke that day... I cannot begin to describe it, but it was as if Daryl were alive and right by my side. We returned to the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/ff_rp_scenes/51721.html"">Figaro feast</a> just in time for dinner. Yet our concerns and ideas on the war as well as Seygora and Alcarin's roles in it proved to be more than enough food for thought. No one present trusted either megalomaniac of a general. Our doubts increased as rain drops would to a river... Word got out that Seygora would be holding a meeting soon, so the majority decided it best to wait until we could get more information about everything before taking any drastic measures. During the course of the evening, Shadow and Relm arrived, Locke vanished (I'll get into that later) and Terra went to check on her children. 

Everyone found themselves on some sort of edge after a while. <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/ff_rp_scenes/58801.html"">Rosa</a> began to show signs of the kind of fatigue one gets before death, so I followed her when she excused herself from the table. Cecil had not been present at dinner. I found the archer a weathered flower in the halls, and carried her to a guest room... when the first <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/ff_rp_scenes/60850.html"">attack on the castle</a> began. Torn between protecting Rosa and defending Figaro, I was relieved when Gogo, bless it's heart, came to my side... I almost kissed it... for reasons unknown to me. Something quintessential drew us together. I did not care if it was male or female; I simply wanted to embrace it. To nuzzle. To keep it warm. Again, I'm baffled by such a desire to one I barely know anything about, but... 

<lj-cut text=""Gogo only"">I think I love you.</lj-cut>

We parted then. On my way to fight, I ran into Cecil... and gave him a rather harsh piece of my mind. But that is a matter between the two of us; one we intend to sort out at the first opportinuty...

The paladin and I ran into Sabin, who took on a big red fellow by the name of Amarant. We headed for <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/ff_rp_scenes/66609.html"">Squall and Eiko</a>. They posed more of a threat than we anticipated; Cecil may be dead for all I know. Something I will never forgive myself for if I find it to be true. I managed to Doom Eiko and Red Card Squall before she managed to knock me out and he gave me another scar across my chest... Bastard.

When I awoke from being unconscions, I found myself <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/ff_rp_scenes/68295.html"">prisoner in Alexandria castle</a>. Squall must have taken me back there. I was placed before Biggs and Wedge, who questioned me with little success, and threw me in the dungeons soon after. As Lady Luck would have it, Locke (incognito) and I found one another. He was disguised as a guard and put me in some cell, where we idly conversed in semi-code. We were equally surprised and shocked to see one another there... the information we shared added to our need to exit Alexandira.

Locke left me, having to run off and finish a mission; we have much to discuss after we escape. My friend was taking quite some time. I began to worry about him, so I <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/ff_rp_scenes/70487.html"">busted out</a> of the cell, and donned a guard disguise of my own. It was then I ran into a small mage by the name of Vivi. We returned to the halls of the castle to find his room, and I discovered that Narshe had been attacked... again...

Currently, my list of things to do is as follows:
 - Continue to run about Alexandira in search for Locke and escape. Inform each other about everything, and go accordingly from there.
 - Figure out what else has become of my other friends and what other nuances have affected the war.
 - Make sure Cecil is alive, converse with him. Check on Rosa.
 - Gogo.

Ah... I'm running out of ink..."

"event","If that kind heart of Rosa's can see something worthwhile in Kain and Cecil, I suppose I'll give them another shot. Yet the odds aren't really stacking in their favor. Eh; the Gabbiani charm will eventually work it's magic.

<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/ff_rp_scenes/46785.html"">Figaro Castle</a> is as sandy as ever; but in a familiar, comforting way. Edgar just <i>had</i> to locate it in the desert. Heh. At least I get that steak dinner without even winning yet. Could it be he admits defeat? A part of me hopes not... to accept with such fervor and then cowardly back out would be very disappointing. While on the subject, it seems as though every possible candidate is taken! With the exception of Rydia... but she doesn't seem to be setting the pace either way.

Eh? Is that <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/ff_rp_scenes/46891.html"">someone new</a> I see coming in from the general Narshe direction? Why pass up the opportunity to escort a fair maiden to our fine midday gathering? *sets off*"

"event","It was good to see <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/ff_rp_scenes/38189.html"">Irene</a> again... save for <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/ff_rp_scenes/38609.html"">Leto</a>, I'm glad that she's doing well. I would have liked to spend more time at The Quicksilver Chocobo together. 

Not much has been happening since we defeated Kefka. Things were returning to normal; I say were, because they are probably as far from it as they can get at this point. I happened upon Terra, Sabin and Edgar on my way to find Leto in the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/ff_rp_scenes/35443.html"">Narshe caves</a>. We shared warm welcomes and such before thrusting ourselves into another spiraling, ominous and catastrophic plot. Nice to know I'm not the only one who lives for the moment.

Evidently, similar to the Magi realm on this continent, there are <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/ff_rp_scenes/43489.html"">other worlds</a> out there. A series of unstable rifts have fabricated an inter-planar web of sorts; but they also seem to leech the life out of the worlds they connect. Kefka is also back in action... something I intend to ameliorate as soon as possible. A war of the worlds is brewing to boot. I'm feeling lucky; it's in the cards. A part of me secretly hopes that Daryl is still out there somewhere. Maybe that's why I so willingly have at this chance to gamble my life.

Aside from the aforementioned friends, I have yet to hear from or about anyone else. It's a shame I wasn't able to bring The Blackjack with me through the rift... but maybe I can work on doing that next time."

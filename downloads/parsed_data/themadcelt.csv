"event","<p>As someone who's life revolves around sound, it's to see how people experienc  the plethora of sounds that surrround them. In Central Park, there is a sonic arts installation in the foot tunnel between the children's zoo and the main zoo. It's filled with collected sounds from all over the city and fills this tunnel with a surreal auditory experience. This tunnel, know for it's echos, becomes an ethereal world filled by the sounds of 6 well placed speakers, and the comings and goings of so many people. Yet as someone who studies the experience of music (for which I borrow Blacking's definition of music as humanly organized sound), the thing that intrigues me the most is how people interact with their sonic environment. It's incredible to me to see how many people just walk through this tunnel of sounds, that is injected at numerous points by a voice saying ""It's a noise show. Slow down..."", without ever giving it a moment of though or attention. They effectively are disonnected from the auditory world they are part of. In the hour I spent listening and watching, only myself, an elderly couple, and two elderly ladies who are tour guides for the park stopped for any significant period of time. Beyond that, most just walked through all but oblivious to the sounds that they walk through. Mostly, it was the children who took the most interest. The occasional teen or adult would glance at the speakers or the 8 1/2"" x 11"" printed and laminated write up about the installation on the gate at either side of the tunnel. It really demonstrates how the specilized and compartmentalized space many people of this culture allow humanly organized sound is separate from that of their daily comings and goings. 

As someone who is so embeinged by sound and music, this is so foreign to me. My life is sound. 

But most do not live in this manner. Even less are taught, as I have been, the Cage paradigmatic principles about listening to the music of the world. 

So think about it. Ask yourself. Do you wander through your world oblivious to the sensuousness of the sonic environment you live in? Do you stop to smell the roses? If you do, do you also listen to the breeze that blows through them and makes the whole garden come alive with the rustling of the leaves? Do you ever listen to the sounds of the cooking, serving, and eating of the meal you savour on the tongue and smell? Do you ever give thought to the score of the movie and it's evocative power?

Or do you just walk through the tunnel oblivious?

"event","Today I am freaking the fuck out. Not in a bad way. The best way possible.<br /><br />I've had a series of experiences the last few days that will permanently alter the course of my research and my conceptions of transcendence, consciousness, and musical experience for the rest of my professional life and personal life both.<br /><br />There really are those days where you realize exactly how charmed your life can be.<br /><br />I'll avoid the super in-depth nitty-gritty neurocognitive stuff for now. If you want to know more, I'd be happy to explain in a phone call, over a beer, or in any sort of long conversation. Either that or you can read my master's dissertation because this is what its going to be. <br /><br />But, I just found a link between my work, the works of my foundational theorist, John Blacking, the works of Rebecca Sager, another influential scholar and a woman who I look forward to calling a colleague someday, the works of Judith Becker, Ben Koen (from FSU, Captain &quot;Persian Perspective&quot;), and the theories on mirror neurons, musical experience, and everything having to do with the biocultural perspective on &quot;Humanly Organized Sound&quot; as Blacking so wonderfully dubbed it. This may be greek to you, so let me put it like this: I've just discovered how all the different perspectives I've been studying and pulling from for the past several months, and much more, the past couple years, have all come together. I've found my missing puzzle piece.<br /><br />But wait, it gets better.<br /><br />Those who have known me for some time will remember I used to work with a World dance and music group called Loud Zoo.&nbsp; Vonn New was one of the founders and someone I had the great pleasure to work with while she was part of it. She was a student of Pauline Oliveros, and was the first one to teach me of Pauline's philosophy of sound and music. Pauline even came down one time. But through my time with Loud Zoo, I was exposed to this.<br /><br />And then, over the years, I forgot about it. Until now that is.<br /><br />As I started working on my review of Judith Becker's <em>Deep Listening: Music, Emotion, and Trance</em>, I was explaining the concept of deep listening which Becker uses. This concept, she explains, draws of the work of Pauline Oliveros. <br />Wait a minute, I thought as I read that, I know that name. Who is that? What is this www.deeplistening.org website? Why is this so familiar?<br /><br />That's when it hit me, when I pulled up the website and saw Pauline's photo, how very charmed life can be some times...<br /><br />I started this journey into the study of transcendence and musical experience long before I actually started studying it. I met this woman long before I got into transcendence research. I was introduced to these concepts about the same time my dear friend and mentor Fred suggested I go into Ethnomusicology. I got involved with this group through the suggestion of my Muse Elitha who, god bless her, has been the belly dancer who helped train me as a Middle Eastern percussionist since I was 16. She was the one who introduced me to Johanna, the then co-leader now leader of Loud Zoo, and Vonn back in the day and told both them and myself I should perform with them.<br /><br />Literally, <br />in one small paragraph<br />in one ethnographic work<br />my entire life for the last 10  years,<br />my music<br />my work<br />my conceptions and perceptions on music and reality<br />everything that is me<br />has inextricably come together.<br /><br />This is really is one of those points where you see all the dots connect in hindsight.<br />Where your entire life comes together.<br />And it is so magical, I've no idea the words to express it.<br /><br />And God Bless the future just got so much more exciting!<br /><br />As-Salamu Alaykum, God Speed, and Namaste.<br /><br />"

Umesh Pandey from Karimpur, the village in Western Uttar Pradesh studied by American anthropologists since 1925, explained the feelings of the anthroplogical subject:

&quot;We want friendship, they want information; we want life-long relations, they want information; we want to think of them as part of our family, they want information. Anthropologists come and go like a dream. It is difficult to know what to like or hate. Still, we love them.&quot;"

I will be stateside for a limited holiday engagement, 

Yes, this means you too can see The Dave while he's back. 

I'll be home as of 18th December and flying out again on 30th December. 

Lemme know if you wanna lock something down to hang out or parrty or whatever so it can go down on the schedule. 

Also, xmas card/postcards are available on request. I say on request cuz I honestly am not sure what anyone's address is right now. so if you want one, shoot me your address. It might be sent from the UK... it might not. It depends on when you get me your addy and such. 

Cheerio y'all and catch you in a couple weeks.

I realize now that I love her more than I will ever love anybody else.<br />Stephen: Stop talking about love. Every asshole in the world says he loves somebody. It means nothing.<br />Michael: That's true.<br />Stephen: It still doesn't mean anything. What you feel only matters to you. Its what you do to the people you say you love, that's what matters. Its the only thing that counts.<br /></em><br /><br />It took me back to a recent conversation I had about how we (the general we not the people involved in the conversation we) treat strangers on the street with more courtesy and respect, and give them overall better treatment, than that which we give to the people in our lives that we say we love. Our family members. Our significant others. Our friends. This has been something that I've thought on a great deal since that conversation and something I've been working on trying to work on in my own life. And I think that bit of dialogue sums the entirety of that concept up more effectively than what I could write.<br /> <br />Its food for thought. Think about how you treat the people in your life. Think about how you act towards them. Because, honestly, I don't think that people in our society treat the people we love as well as we treat perfect strangers. And why the hell not?<br /><br />Remember, what you feel only matters to you. Its what you do that counts. I know psychology will back me up on that account. Make your actions count.<br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","but I haven't had the time.

But I must say that Irony is sometimes far from funny.

Yesterday evening, A friend of mine was meeting with a recruiter to join the Army for all the wrong reasons. He was joining despite the fact that he doesn't necessarily agree with the current political reasoning behind the war.

Then late last night, I heard the news about a friend of mine from high school.
http://blogs.tampabay.com/breakingnews/2008/04/pasco-soldier-k.html

As if the irony of one friend signing up the day I hear that another friend died, it gets kicked up another notch.

I was listening to a Celtic music station when I found out about this last night. Shortly after getting the news, what song come on but Amazing Grace.

Its all a little coincidental and ironic.

Irony, thy name is jackass."

To all my Jewish friends, I'm sorry for the belated Happy Hanukkah wishes. The Festival of Lights in the middle of hell/finals week and such meant that the family were the only one's who got a call.

To all who don't celebrate any of these particular flavors, a happy early New Years and Kwanzaa and Solstice (so what if you're not pagan, its still a kool day) and all other sorts of winter merriment to you.

Cheers,

I am waiting. I am not sleeping. I am waiting to make a phone call. I am waiting for a professor's office hour at 11 am GMT, roughly 3 hours from now. 

I am waiting to call the Graduate Program director in the Anthropology/Ethnomusicology Department at Queen's University Belfast.

I am calling her to discuss the email I was sent on Tuesday. 

I am calling her to discuss the terms of my acceptance into the Graduate Program at Queen's University Belfast, and to start getting details on the process of entering the program. 

I am calling because in September of next year I will be starting my Masters degree in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

And now its 3:12 am. I have 2 hours and 43 minutes to go. 
No Sleep til I make my call.

"event","What a difference a day makes....<br /><br />And to imagine, its been 3 months worth since I've cataloged anything here. How so much has changed, while so many things have stayed the same.<br />I spent a week and a half visits friends in Cali and in Zona. I am thankful for the time I had there. It was time well spent and a recharge I truly needed. <br />I came home and hit the ground running. <br />Since then, my business has begun to move forward and started to consume a lot of my time. As well, I took a full load of classes over the summer term, something that as well consumed the half of my time. I've stepped up and taken on new responsibilities with <i>Stranger Things</i>. And Ashley and I have grown closer each day and are doing phenomenal. <br />As if things had not changed as much as they had these past few months, far more had changed in the last week.<br />One choice can change the course of your life. I made one of those choices this week.<br />I changed to topic of my Honors Thesis. I declined the opportunity given to me by my professor. Its hard to turn down something offered to you by someone you respect so much. So not only did I decide not to follow that research path, I decided to go down my own. I am doing research in my field, ethnomusicology. I am doing research of my own design in a department and university where there is no one who knows my field or can really assist me farther than general theories and methodology of cultural anthropology, but nothing specific to my work. I have a lot of outside support and sources, but nothing from inside. <br />Currently, I do not have an adviser. <br />But I am doing my work.&nbsp; This will be my research. Or, as the head of the Anthro Honors program calls it, its ""My Baby"".<br /><br />I will have an adviser this week.<br />I will have a completed thesis come mid-Spring.<br /><br />There's many things afoot. <br />Since I came back home after my trip, I hit the ground running. <br /><br />The Devil's beatin' down my back door and followin me every step of the way.<br /><br />As long as I keep my feet moving, I'll always stay one step ahead.<br /><br />God Speed My Friends.<br /><br />Wish the same to me."

Sometimes I think about how I got to where I am now

Hindsight is 20-20 right?

Maybe you can only read things clearly that way sometimes.

Sometimes it seems like I am taking one step forward and to steps back.

Sometimes its frustrating.

But then I look back at the road that lay behind me.

And I realize, I never stepped back.

The road of life is a journey. 

Its an adventure.

It curves sometimes.

But you never go backward.

I think people forget that sometimes. 

You are not who you were yesterday.

You never will be that person again. 

Consider it the Felix Coulpa.

The fortunate fall if you will. 

I look back and I smile.

A wise man once said:

Life is all about Adventures
Life is all about Journeys
Not just one Journey
But many

And what an adventure it has been so far.

I can't wait to see whats around the next turn.

But I know that there is not step backward.

Constant progression is the way of life.

Learning is a daily experience, not something meant for a special time or place.

Learning is living.

Progression is life.

When you stop, you might as well be dead.

What an adventure, eh?"

When you ate meat, what was your all time favorite meaty dishes?<br />Beef Shwarma and BBQ ribs and a good Cuban sandwich<br /><br /><br />3. What are your predictions for your life in the year 2007?<br />i see myself busting my ass in school<br />and my business bringing in some good income<br />and having lots of fun enjoying every single day<br /><br />4. Tomato - Fruit or Vegetable?<br />i say fruit<br />It's a fruit technically<br />however, i will cite wikipedia here:<br /><p>""Botanically speaking, a tomato is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary_%28plants%29"" title=""Ovary (plants)"">ovary</a>, together with its seeds, of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowering_plant"" title=""Flowering plant"">flowering plant</a>, that is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit"" title=""Fruit"">fruit</a> or, more precisely, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry"" title=""Berry"">berry</a>. However, from a culinary perspective, the tomato is not as sweet as those foodstuffs usually called fruits and it is typically served as part of a main course of a meal, as are other <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable"" title=""Vegetable"">vegetables</a>, rather than at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessert"" title=""Dessert"">dessert</a>. As noted above, the term ""vegetable"" has no botanical meaning and is purely a culinary term.</p> <p>This argument has led to actual legal implications in the United States, Australia and China. In <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1887"" title=""1887"">1887</a>, U.S. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff"" title=""Tariff"">tariff</a> laws that imposed a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_%28economics%29"" title=""Duty (economics)"">duty</a> on vegetables but not on fruits caused the tomato's status to become a matter of legal importance. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States"" title=""Supreme Court of the United States"">U.S. Supreme Court</a> settled this controversy in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1893"" title=""1893"">1893</a>, declaring that the tomato is a vegetable, using the popular definition which classifies vegetable by use, that they are generally served with dinner and not dessert. The case is known as <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_v._Hedden"" title=""Nix v. Hedden"">Nix v. Hedden</a></i> (149 U.S. 304). Strictly speaking, the holding of the case applies only to the interpretation of the Tariff Act of March 3, 1883, and not much else. The court does not purport to reclassify tomato for botanical or for any other purpose other than paying a tax under a tariff act. However, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture"" title=""United States Department of Agriculture"">USDA</a> also considers the tomato a vegetable.</p> <p>The tomato has been designated the state vegetable of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey"" title=""New Jersey"">New Jersey</a>. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas"" title=""Arkansas"">Arkansas</a> takes both sides by declaring the ""South Arkansas Vine Ripe Pink Tomato"" to be both the state fruit and the state vegetable in the same law, citing both its botanical and culinary classifications. In 2006, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_House_of_Representatives"" title=""Ohio House of Representatives"">Ohio House of Representatives</a> passed a law that would have declared the tomato to be the official state fruit, but the bill died when the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate"" title=""Ohio Senate"">Ohio Senate</a> failed to act on it.</p> <p>But due to the scientific definition of a fruit and a vegetable, the tomato still remains a fruit when not dealing with tariffs. Nor is it the only culinary vegetable that is a botanical fruit: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggplant"" title=""Eggplant"">eggplants</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber"" title=""Cucumber"">cucumbers</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_%28fruit%29"" title=""Squash (fruit)"">squashes</a> of all kinds (including <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zucchini"" title=""Zucchini"">zucchini</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin"" title=""Pumpkin"">pumpkins</a>) share the same ambiguity.""</p><br /><br />5. Give me a good reason to hug a tree.<br />because they make it so you can breathe<br />you should love them<br />if not for them, you would be dead<br /><br /><br />For everyone else, just respond with ""Interview Me"" and I will do the same for you. Just post my questions in your journal with the answers!"

This was the case until just a minute ago. I was listening to the middle-eastern/indian influenced music station I'd created on Pandora( quick aside: If you don't know what pandora is, go to www.pandora.com. It is the best shit ever created. Also, check out openpandora.googlepages.com. that is very kool program to go along with it.) Anyways, this song Siki, Siki Baba came on. Its kool as all hell, and the background rhythm played on the dumbek friggin rocks. So I sat here analyzing the drum pattern and attempting to figure out the what the percussionist was doing, so that I could learn the variation/solo work he was doing. Getting to the point, I can not go grab my drum and try these things out. I won't get the heavy duty ass bandage off until friday. 

That, my friends, is the definition of suck. Being a professional musician and being inspired to perform, yet due to physical injury you can not.

It's times like this that make me grumpy."

We all get so complicated in our lives
When walking just walk
When sitting just sit
When being just be
Above all don't stray from your chosen path

And burn like a good bonfire
In whatever you do
Burn like a good bonfire
And I know you'll come through
Burn like a good bonfire
In whatever you do
Burn like a good bonfire
And may peace come to you

The time is long overdue for a house clearing of the soul
We all get so complicated in our lives

Burn like a good bonfire
In whatever you do
Just burn like a good bonfire
And I know you'll come through
Burn like a good bonfire
In whatever you do
Burn like a good bonfire
And may strenght flow through you"

"event","I know as a matter of fact that there are things I should be doing right now. I should be catching up on reading. I should be starting to examine the 2 translations of Beowulf that I should be writing a paper on for my linguistic anthropology class. I should be doing something. But, instead, I am tired. And so I write.
          Yesterday was a little bit of a difficult day for me. Although, I've found myself much more in the optimum mindset as of late, some days its hard to keep my inner demons at bay. Sometimes that darkness seeps into my light outlook. It can make for a rough day, especially compounded on top of the busy schedule I've had the past couple days, the test I had last night, the stress of many uncertainties, my weariness which is most likely caused by not getting enough sleep, and general introspective examination of my life. I think by the end of the day I figured out the point of it all. 
           I need to make some changes in my life. I have a decent idea of what some of those should be. When I first came back from Europe, I had a certain level of freedom from material dependence. This came from being far less exposed to things like T.V. and video games and having a bunch of ""stuff"" than I, within my typical American lifestyle, had become accustomed. In many ways this felt extremely liberating. I have, in the part two year since, throw away many material objects that serve no purpose. However, as far as I've come, I still have a long way to go. I have fallen back into my old ways a bit, with television and WoW being regular elements of my life. Also, I have way TOO much shit. 
           One of my goals since I have returned home from that trip has been to return to having little more in the way of possessions than what I can fit within a rucksack (for those not familiar with the terminology, a traveller's backpack so to speak). I think it may be time yet again to sort through my possessions and find more to throw away. This is becoming more and more difficult every time. I'm starting to get down to things that have more sentimental value. Many might think it odd that I would want to separate with items like this, but really what are they but dust collectors. And I don't mean I will throw away things that are irreplaceable and I will regret later on, but sometimes you must move on past some things and let the physical reminders go. The memories always remain.
           Also, I think I should do something with my TV. It needs to go somewhere else. Part of me is tempted to get rid of the whole thing, but I'm not quite sure if that is going to far to the extreme. It would do me good if I were to do so, and attempt to lead a more hermetic lifestyle where I could focus more heavily on my studies and my arts. Yet, still, thats one comfort I'm not sure if I am fully ready to get rid of. 
           I think what I really need to do s find a day and go somewhere absent of all the usual material crap that holds me back, and meditate. Perhaps if those temptations were not present, I could make a conscious decision to take that path. 
           Talking about changing your whole world view, huh?

Some days those demons aren't so bad. At least they make you think, Right?"

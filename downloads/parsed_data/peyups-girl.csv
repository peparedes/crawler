"event","After months of not updating my journal, here I am again. Its been a long time. How have I been doing? I'm pretty good. 

Last night, I felt sad because I feel some of my officemates hate me. They hate me because I demanded and got the salary I wanted. Even though I am still relatively new in the company, I got a higher salary than the others who came before me, but lower than those who are part of the 'pioneer' batch. Is that unfair? No, I don't think so because I was able to justify my demand.

Envy can really blind you. It saddens me because I want to get along with everyone. But hey, you can't please everybody. 

Its just sad, I am not doing anything, but they hate me for some apparent reason. I've experienced this several times now. There are some girls who envy me, and thus they would group together and talk behind my back. I try to be civil, I try to be professional. But they would snub me just to let me know they spite me."

"event","Dear, Thank you for making him better. Thank you for making him well. I know that you love him and you have a plan for him. Dear, Thank you also for giving me such wonderful office mates. They prayed for my boyfriend and they gave me encouragement. I am overwhelmed by the support that they have shown. Even if I don't talk to them much, even if we are not that close, they still gave me comfort and hope. They still went out of their way to ask me how I am. Maybe its because they can relate. They have a loved-one too - a boyfriend, a husband,a child at home and they know how hard it is to see someone you love sick. And that someone isn't just sick but close to death. 

When I think about death, I get scared. I am afraid to see my loved ones die. I know it is wrong because death isn't the end. I will still see them again. I hold on to them too tightly, but there will come a time when you will tell me to let go. And Dear when that time comes, please give me the strength to do that. 

I'm still worrying about money Dear. I worry about not having enough until the next pay day. I spent most of my money riding a taxi from work to the hospital. I have been staying there for the past few nights now. I stay up all night thinking and just watching over him. Then I leave early in the morning because I have to go to school and the office. Dear, help me not to worry about things. I know that you are in control. I know that you will do great things. Help me to just continue to trust in you. There is more to life than wealth, power, and prestige."

"event","I wish my family was rich so I do not have to work while still in school. I am getting tired of working here. I also feel alone again. I guess I lack ""pakikisama"" so I seem invisible. My sup and TL do not see me or give me any attention. Aside from that, I am underpaid. I am hesitant of staying at the boarding house because I might feel lonely all the more. I guess so many things is wrong with me. I have become indifferent with my work. I only care about earning just to survive on my own. I am not happy with my work because I do not get paid very well. I also do not have that much friends at work.

I keep thinking about him and what my life would be if he was my boyfriend. He is not that intelligent and he is undeniably horny. He is the anti-thesis of a true God-centered guy. Still I like him, even if he already cursed me thru text before. He easily explodes at the slightest provokion. He is emotional and immature, just like me. And he does not really know me at all, all he wants is to get a taste of me. He remarked I was intellectually sexy, yes, but reading my post, that is not true on all occasions. I lack confidence and pity myself most of the time. He has not texted me yet. I feel it is wrong to meet up with him if he is like that. I am only fascinated with his social status - nothing more."

"event","Dear, 
   I am not living my life as I should be. I am living in darkness, in sin. I am sorry.. Now I know why I am lonely, miserable and aching for something more. I just want to make things right. I want to live to please you. But how can I ? 

I do not want to go back to the slums. I do not and cannot stand it there even though the people I love the most are there - my parents, my brothers. My mom and dad are getting old I am afraid I might not live to see them this healthy and alive again. I will miss countless days, and hours with them. Aside from that, back home, there is unlimited supply of nourishment for the body, to alleviate my hunger. And best of all, everything is free. 

But I cannot stand it there, the place is not conducive, it is not liveable. The location is not safe either. I could get mugged or raped  anytime of the day, especially at night when I go home from work. The environment encourages me to be lethargic and depressed. I would be too tired to get up in the morning for school. I would lose my mind just seeing the trash and garbage all over the place. Just staring at the cobwebs' in the bedroom made me pity myself and my family. People outside will never understand what I am talking about.

Maybe I strive too much for perfection. I want things to be organized ,clean and perfect. I want my life to be perfect.. even if it will never be. Outside, the world is cruel. My meager salary all goes to lutong-bahay food from Goldilocks or the school canteen for my breakfast/lunch and dinner. I barely have anything left for myself. How can I be happy? I am living in lies, telling my parents' I stay in some dormitory when really, I am not. I am a wandering soul, with no permanent place, no room to call my own. I just sleep where I can sleep just to rest from a day's work. 

Dear, you know how it is. My life is easier now, yes, and my life is free from the clutter of the slums. But I am living a lie. I am living in a deep black hole. I am guilty, I confess I am guilty. I do not like myself for what I am doing. In exchange for a good nights' sleep, I sell my soul to the enemy. I let myself fall down, to a degrading lifestyle. I do not believe in love anymore. I do not believe in the 'sweeter song' because all I can hear is noise. 

My mind is in chaos, so help me Dear, help me. I do not know what to do anymore."

"event","No classes today. (sigh) Yes, I know I slept at 3am and I wouldn't be able to wake up for my 8am class anyway. But Im sad because all of my planned activities for today was moved (again). I had things to do today, which I would have to do tomorrow, that is, if we'll have class tomorrow. Im not so keen about attending class. Bes is right, I have become dispassionate about life. But I am looking forward to the Elevate concert tomorrow, to which I have yet to get tickets.

Last night, at about 1030pm, I went to Quezon Hall with some friends. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing, sparked by all the chaos going on in the Fort by the Marines at that time. Prof. Randy David and former UP President Nemenzo was there, including the media and other political groups. Its good to expose yourself to current issues, and see the 'real' situation as it really is. 

""Get involved. Spark change."" I wonder if I get involved, will it make any difference? I've given up on the current situation of the country. I don't want to be apathetic, or indifferent... But there are times when you have nothing else to do except... pray? or give up."

"event","Later, after my 230 class, I am going to show my support in the evangelistic filmshowing we're having in UP. Maybe il attend college fellowship afterwards instead of just spending the evening with Bes. 

Yet something is holding me back from doing so because my heart still isn't right. Its sad when you know what you're supposed to do, what is the 'right' thing to do, yet you don't do it. Or rather, you choose not to do it. Again, I am contradicting what I said earlier.

This saturday night, I plan to attend the close-up lovapalooza event in BayWalk, with none other than Bes. Its funny, I search for activities to do yet I am not productive at all. I want to surround myself with activities, with noise, with people; thinking that I am making progress when really, I'm not. 

My acads isn't going well. I think I have exceeded the number of allowed absences in geodetic engg1, so I might just drop it. The class schedule was too early for me; I prefer to sleep during mornings. I'm pretty sure Il get a 5.0 in symbolic logic, so I might as well give up. The only thing I fear is not being able to shift and graduate on time. My college life right now doesn't have direction. My future after college seems bleak. *sigh*"

"event","Its 12am and I'm feeling lonely. I must resist the urge to chat with strangers on line, and find something better to do. I guess I need a hug right now or maybe just someone to talk to. 
 
Or maybe I need to get it right with Him. All my deepest longings to be loved and accepted can be fulfilled only by Him. Yeah, I am from UP, I know I am supposed to be a 'liberated' chic or an atheist. I should just have sex and continue to live my life recklessly. Yet I am NOT, because I am a Christian. The very word 'christian' will always affect the way I think, act and live my life. It will always be part of who I am.

A part of me wants to live purely for Him; a part of me wants to rebel. I am often a 'walking contradiction'..?! Sometimes I want to withdraw from my christian group, and isolate myself, and be with Bes. Of course, that would only make me lonelier than I am already am... I wish I could find joy in this life, not just happiness. Happiness is dependent on current ""happenings"" and circumstances, thus, the feelings of happiness are temporary. I want to find real joy, but of course, only He can give me joy. So I have to decide between right and wrong: love or lust, Him or the world, life or death. 

I choose joy, I choose life, I choose Him."

"event","I finally created my own livejournal. Its a bit late, I know. Creating a live journal was the trend way back so please forgive me for taking so long to create one and making such a fuss about it now. 
  
I guess having a journal on line is different, knowing that someone will eventually read what you write. It will restrict what you say and what you divulge. Sometimes you can't be too specific; you can't give out personal info because they are just too personal. 

But at the same time having a livejournal will make my journey through life a little less lonely. Somehow, other people will know what I am going through, what I am feeling and thinking at a particular moment, and maybe some would even care. Hehehe. So my goal is to be as spontaneous and honest as possible, and just write whatever comes to mind. I should resist the urge to re-write/revise/edit my entries here, in the false hopes of acheiving 'perfection'. I am not even satisfied with the 'way' I write: my style of writing is very simple and sometimes what I write is unintelligible. So again, forgive me. :)"

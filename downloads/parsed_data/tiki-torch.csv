"event","yesterday i ditched class so i could go read my book at barnes and noble and then i went and saw the other boleyn girl by myself. it was a great alone day and the first time i've ever seen a movie by myself. i wore a black dress and big sunglasses and either therefore or coincidentally felt compelled to compose a short story in my head over the course of the afternoon. i had 4 fellow moviegoers and two were wearing those huge dental hygenist scrub things with patterns of smiley faces and kites and shit. the ghosts of their undergrad selves probably roll in their graves whenever they wear those, surely they promised themselves they'd never do that. anyway, i think it must have been dental hygenist skip day. the other boleyn girl was surprisingly great, i thought an all star cast would poison my escape and paradise that is tudor england but it didn't! note the spanish and french hoods. some things were kind of skewed for dramatic effect though and maybe some things left out that shouldn't have been. the complexity of characters wasn't so well done but the whole formidable and inspiring women thing was alright. little mary tudor makes an appearance, not looking so sickly. of course elizabeth in her appearance at the end appears to be much cuter than mary. katherine of aragon drops ""whore"" like some common birmingham party girl which i don't think she ever would have really done. though she did have a spanish accent--(whats up with those movies that take place somewhere in europe..like italy, or something, but all the accents are british like that's just how all europeans speak?)--so that was good. she's well cast in that she is just how i imagined she was in her older age. such an inspiring and formidable woman, AND the actress even had an equally formidable mole on her upper lip. sick.





Lois and i had been friends for six months when our relationship suddenly assumed a competitive edge. I'd never cared who made better grades or had more spending money. We each had our strenths; the most important thing was to honor eachother for the thing that person did best. My superior wisdom and innate generosity allowed me to be truly happy for Lois up until the day she questioned by ability to understand the visiting actor.The first few times he visited, she'd been just like the rest of them, laughing at his neck brace and rolling her eyes at his tights. I was the one who first identified his brilliance, and now she was saying i couldn't understand him? Methinks not.
""Honestly, woman,"" I said to my mother on our way to the dry cleaner, ""to think that this low-lying worm might speak to me of greatness as though it were a thing invisible to mine eyes is more than i can bear. Her words doth strike mine heart with the force of a punishing blow, leaving me both stunned and high vexed, too. Hear me, though, for i shall bide my time, quietly, and with cunning, striking back at the very hour she doth least expect it. Such an affront shall not go unchallenged, of that you may rest assured, gentle lady.""
""You'll get over it,"" my mother said. ""Give it a week or two and i'm sure everything will be back to normal."""

"event","i've been inexplicably bummed since december. it didn't help me overcome sickness either, i took to my bed for awhile there. and was pissed at myself every second, i hate laziness i hate stagnance. the laziness now has turned into leisurely recklessness, i'm going to read my book at barnes and noble rather than go to school. this weekend was so good for me, it took me back to november when everything was pretty great. also the boys came home for dinner for the first time in forever. that type of understanding and that type of love is so good and i can't really think of anything for you to be able to compare it to. just search for it, it's out there if you aren't one of the types that keeps everyone at arms length. it's not selfishness i dont think, rather ignorance and difference in priorities.

commitments and relationships are always a little up in the air, as they've always been. as much as i think i dislike it, i like it and i need it. i talk myself out of things and then someone surprises me in a great way and i think it's too good to be true. it sucks being distrustful to the point where you can't believe compliments and you can't believe statements that happen to be flattering or just an outpouring of a soul, really. remember that ben folds song that said if you cant trust you cant be trusted? surely he knows what he's talking about, we've been close since i was in like 8th grade right? i think it's true. and i think it's understandable and noble and unfortunate at the same time. constant realizations, constant conclusion making. and then pondering those and coming to new realizations and conclusions. i live for deep thinkers deep listeners poor mans philosophy question everything. everything. everything!

i didn't tell anyone really for fear of embarassment at experiencing such a situation at 20 years old. however it's whatever, that love and bond is there still regardless of topical altercations. i will tell you where to go with all of that, though.


seriously though i'm almost 20. matrons R us over here. 


the weather does great things for me. resilience. you can model yourself or draw inspo from anything. i'm painting tonight. 


To hear my mother talk, you'd think the sunny, manicured streets of suburban Raleigh were crawling with heroin addicts, the needles poking through the sleeves of their tattered police uniforms. It embarrassed me to hear her use phrases like ""copping a fix"", and ""the pusher man"". ""I have to go now,"" she'd say to the grocery clerk. ""My mother-in-law is back at the house, jonesing for her lunch."" Only on network television did people talk this way. I couldn't bear the detective shows but made it a point to regularly check in with <i>The Fugitive</i>...Lisa liked The Fugitive because, she said, ""He's easy on the eyes."" The Fugitive had no fancy convertible or stylish wet bar. He was cut from a different cloth, <i>my</i> kind of cloth, the itchy kind. Lisa wouldn't know a sensitive loner if he crawled into her lap with a fistful of daisies, and it annoyed me when she labeled The Fugitive as ""my kind of show."""

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;well last night/today i literally worked on prints from 9pm to 10am. 

and ian and chaz stayed up all night too and did work in the printing room with me. fittingly the conversations that lasted all night were dominated by pondering 
existentialism and sartre. 

also the tendencies of the&nbsp;pseudo-intellectual to be into it and talking about it 

point is i told someone to read into it the other day because it's fitting, encouraging,&nbsp;discouraging, cleansing,&nbsp;and cluttering&nbsp;for people in certain stages of life accompanied with certain states of mind (myself included in the category). 
and i think some other people (specific) should read it to get into the same state of mind? i think too many people walk the earth and don't know or think or know how to think that they actually exist.&nbsp; 
and if you forget your existence or don't think about it in terms of humanity and the human condition surely it becomes a cycle you perpetuate with your self involved self loathing self loving you just dont know and it's like

everything is great i hope it stays 

and for final projects that really are entirely general and open ended which is great:
for art issues: contemporary underground avante garde in respect to high vs. low art. so, graffiti and tattoos, why and what is low/excluded from the canon, etc. so i may be asking you to let me take a photo or two of ya tats if you have ones i'm interested in. 

for lit and the visual experience: painter poets/ visual and verbal arts comparison, mainly focusing on william blake and contemporary underground visual/verbal arts and artists in terms of comics, zines, graffiti tattoos etc."

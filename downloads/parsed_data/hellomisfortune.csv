If you wait for me 
then I'll come for you
Although I've traveled far
I always hold a place for you in my heart

If you think of me
If you miss me once in awhile
Then I'll return to you
I'll return and fill that space in your heart 

Remembering
Your touch
Your kiss
Your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting

If you dream of me 
like I dream of you
In a place that's warm and dark
In a place where I can feel the beating of your heart 

Remembering
Your touch
Your kiss
Your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting

I've longed for you 
And I have desired
To see your face your smile
To be with you wherever you are 

Remembering
Your touch
Your kiss
Your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
Please say you'll be waiting 

Together again
It would feel so good to be
In your arms
Where all my journeys end
If you can make a promise 
If it's one that you can keep
I vow to come for you
If you wait for me 

And say you'll hold
A place for me 
in your heart."

i know the days are closing in on when she will be leaving and its killing me. i think this will be one of the hardest things to deal with, but i am prepared and ready.
new years eve was filled with Monster House, the ball dropping, and rockos modern life. couldnt of been better. i really dont get why people feel the need to drink/or get drunk. i understand some people have a problem but some people are just lame about it.

The bell tolls for an hour straight
Screaming mothers chase their children down
Fathers tear out their eyes
As the city topples to the ground 

Outside the streets are in a panic
Truth sellers jump from tall, tall ledges
No sign of Christ with a sword in his mouth
Beneath the blood red sky I'll sit and laugh with you tonight

This is a promise I made to you
I'll be right there
I'll be right next to you

When the trumpets blare the loudest and cannons roar
All the trains that once came for you
Spill off the tracks floor
All your horrors they multiply
And you realize your fears
I'll block your ears with both of my hands
Kiss away the tears

When the armageddon's been locked and loaded
I will come back for you...

"event","I'll be quiet to keep you quiet.
Don't concern yourself with my slow dying.
Through the vents I hear you sigh.
I don't get too high these days.
Your floor is my ceiling.
Lights out, you can't come in.
If you don't remind me, I won't forget you.
If you don't ask, I won't upset you.
I am jet black.
I am stone cold.
Jet black to the center.
Funny like a funeral.
I need you to bury me.
White noise in black room dust.
These hands long for one last touch.
Hourglass all out of trust.
I don't scratch so I won't itch.
I don't reach so I won't miss.
I taste our last kiss.
This is the cure: the same as the symptom.
Simple and pure: break to keep fixing.
Patiently nurse, patient and nurse.
This is the part I wouldn't show you.
The part where you say, ""I don't even know you.""
This is your cue.
Be glad it's through.

if you havent ever listened to jawbreaker you are a loser.  the song jet black is one of the best songs i have ever heard"

"event","heathurr and i went to south haven yesterday. i got to meet her friends alex and katie, whom i thought were very friend worthy people. we also took a walk down the pier to the light house and just took in the beautiful atmosphere. the water looked beautiful, people were splashing and playing on the beach, and the fips were out enjoying there million dollar houses and outrageous boats. i didnt think paradise would be located so close to indiana. all and all it was a good trip to south haven. heathurr took me to some of the stores around there seemed real excited to be there with me. which we needed. we had one argument that escalated to more then we should of let it, but i think both of us are going to be more aware of the things that we do to make it escalate like that. i love that girl so much and the trip really made me happy. i wouldnt of wanted to be there with anyone else but her.
heathurr also took me the The Zoo. a gay bar in kalamazoo. we showed up pretty early and just sat and talked. eventually people started rolling in and my disgust for people started to kick in and i just felt sick to my stomach seeing all the people trying soooo hard and acting so cool. heathurr and i just sat back and people watched and seriously i was with the hottest girl there. gay bars=lame.
before we fell asleep that night we talked. which is getting to be routine for us which is nice. i like going to bed knowing we chizzled away at a little of the uncertainty each night. before i may have been a big manipulator and all about myself but i have never wanted to set anything straight in my life more then this. 
""ive looked around enough to know, that you're the one i wanna go thru time with""

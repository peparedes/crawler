"event","i wrote 2 more poems:

""gone""
I'm gone.
I've floated too far away.
You can't save me now,
You're too late.
I'm out of reach.
My station's changed,
Don't touch that dial!
I'm never coming home,
You'll never see me again.
I'm gone.
You don't mean a thing to me.
I'm going towards the light now.
Don't try, you won't succede.
I'm gone forever.
You were too late.
Don't try to apologize now,
You're words can't help,
they never did.
You always found a way to make things worse.
It was just the something about you that killed me,
You put me in my grave,
You make these cuts on my wrists,
And now I'm gone for good.
Too late to be sorry,
Whats done is done,
And now I'm gone.

""Dear Love""
Dear Love,
I hope you've enjoyed our time together.
I know it will always be cherished,
In my heart, and yours.
And so we will live on forever,
Our love can never die.
It's impossible to break a friendship as strong as ours.
No matter what obsticles come between us,
they may not be so easy to overcome,
But neither is what we have.
Sticks and stones may break our bones,
but nothing can kill our souls.
Something so intertwined as us, could never fall apart.
And so here we are,
together forever,
two as one,
Whatever you want to call it!
All that matters is we have each other,
and we're together now.

...so??? i think i like the first one better? coments please...unlike that last poems i posted that no one ever commented about!! >.< oh, did i spell ""apologize"" right? is there 2 p's??

Starve me to death, I don't care.
Torture me 'till I break and my body can't take the pain. 
Just drain me 'till i die.
This is my last goddbye.
Now flee the scene.

ok...so? comments are highly suggested!! lol. now here's another (with no title) its short too...

Is there something wrong with the blood that flows in your veins?
What the hell's wrong with you?
Why would you say something like that?
Now I'm too numb to feel,
and too hurt to care.
And it's all your fault!
You monster!
You're screwing up my life.
But there's always hope, right?

i'm not to sure i like that one. i like a couple of the lines, i was just really pissed off lol. so tell me what would make it better cuz i think it sucks. and now here's another! also without a title...

I wore red the night we met.
You saw me from across the room.
We looked into each other's eyes.
It was beautiful.
What is it about me that you love?
You say I'm perfect,
Well I say it's people's imperfections that make them perfect.
You don't want to lose me, do you?
Then keep me locked away somewhere safe...
In your heart is a good place.
I'll love you forever.

so?...oh, now here's the first one i wrote tonight. it's that thing you write when you get back at someone...(with no title)

You crushed me so bad,
as if I were nothing.
Tore me all to pieces,
shredded apart.
If I could quit living in the past,
maybe we could work something out.
But if you ca't except me for me,
then I guess we were never working in the first place.
You're like a machine that never stops...BREAKING GIRL'S HEARTS!
But you're just a boy,
A child still, nothing worth crying over.
And I'm so glad I've finaly realized that now.
And don't try to get me back after this,
'cause I won't have you anymore,
You can't hurt me now!

well?? those are my four poems...tell me what ya think! oh and i need help with this too...where it says ""If I could quit living in the past"" instead of ""quit"", do you think it should say ""stop"" instead? im really picky on my choice of words!

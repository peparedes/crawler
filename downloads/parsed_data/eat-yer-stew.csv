"event","Yo. This is my first entry.
I made this here journal because
Egon and Tash always seemed to have fun.
Plus I wanna post comments, hey maybe even make friends.
But I dont really know how to work everything yet.
I need alot of help on somethings, but I'll figure it out.

Tash, you like the icon, its just for you. JUST MARRIED<3

------------------------------------------
Well, it snowed today. I don't like snow.
I don't like being cold either, it puts me in a weird mood.
Like a depressing mood or something, weird.
Um. Last night I had to work, sucky as always.
But its fun working with everyone you live with.
I love the people I live with, its a constant party.
Damian, Vin, Dan, Egon, Mike, & Edison have grown to me like brothers.
I never had a brother, but its cool!
My first year at Marshall was kind of lonely.
I was home sick for a long time.
But I had a few classes with them all & we bonded I guess.
Then the summer before my second year we all kept in contact over the summer,
the we thought WTF lets get an apartment & now I love it here.
I mean the place in general sucks ass but my friends do not.
Plus I've met some awesome WV natives.
My #1 best friend ever! Natasha Maye Rayl.
Actually she is basically apart of the gang.
She met Egon somehow, I really don't know... & they dated.
They were an awesome couple & still Best Friends!
I don't know but when they started  dating she became friends with us all.
They decided that they didn't want to be together,
which really worried me because I thought I'd never see her again.
But luckily its an everyday thing.
SADDEST NEW!! She is pretty sure she is going to California for art school.
I mean that is fantastic but, I DO NOT WANT HER TO LEAVE US!
I mean she can atleast wait a year or two before she goes? right?
But this is my first entry. I feel really weird.
As if I'm talking to people who are actually going to read this.
I know no one will probably read it, but still if you want to be my friend
ADD ME or whatever and I'll figure something out & I'll add you."

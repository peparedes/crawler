"event","I think about these things all the time, I'm just putting them out here so people could let me know if they think the same.<br /><br /><br /><br />1. why are the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, etc.,etc., called one-two-three-four-five-six-seven- and so forth? Who got to decide that big of a thing should be?<br /><br />2. Why is blue,red,purple, etc., called blue, red and purple? I think they look more like George, Brianne, and Bill's, and same as up there, who got to decide this?<br />3. Who got to say 1+1=2? I think it should equal chair.<br /><br />4.Why are we called girls, women, ladies, etc.,&nbsp;and the guys called guys, or boys, or men.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />These are just some of the things I think about, and I also feel really strongly towards churches. How do we know what they are preaching to us is true? I mean don't get me wrong, maybe there is a god, but how do we know what they say about him is true, like that HE wants us to do all these things [referencing to the Ten Commandments.] and not just the church. But I guess that's a whole matter of belief, something I'm not prepared or interested to get in to. I don't go to church so don't take my opinion on how things work, I don't have a religion really.<br /><br />Don't take offense to any of this, I'm not intending to offend, I'd just like to make a point.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Now.<br />You know who has REAL songs I mean songs that you can relate to, and aren't the same as every other song, besides My Chemical Romance and Panic! At the Disco?<br />Motion City Soundtrack.<br />Take for instance, this song:<br /><br /><br /><strong>""Where I Belong""<br /><br /></strong>Hello there, how you doin'?<br />I've got all these thoughts just floating through my brain<br />They bump and they collide and cause a flurry of confusion<br />And it's getting on my nerves<br />I try to hold myself together<br />fighting off this mental weather when I can (sometimes I do)<br />But this shitstorm's never ending<br />And the atmospheric pressure's calling for rain<br /><br />This is what I've got going on<br />This is where I belong tonight<br /><br />It's chaos in the courthouse<br />And the left side's all upset <br />Because the right side wants a summer home<br />and knows we can't afford it<br />I try to mediate between<br />This constant tug-o-war machine<br />But wind up in a never ending game of telephone<br />There's so much going on<br />And I just need seven minutes to calm myself back down<br />Now I forgot where I was<br />Was it me we were talking about?<br />This is what I feared from the start<br />I keep falling apart<br /><br />What's going on, is this where I belong tonight?<br />(What's going on tonight)<br />What's going on, is this where I belong tonight?<br />(What's going on)<br /><br />(Can't stand) I can't stand the thought of losing<br />Sentences and every island of words<br />(Can't stand) I can't stand the thought of losing<br />Everything I ever thought I that I knew<br /><br />This is where I run out of words<br />That describe how I'm so damn hurt<br />This is where I fumble and fold<br />And take what I'm told<br /><br />What's going on, is this where I belong tonight?<br />(What's going on tonight)<br />What's going on, is this where I belong tonight?<br />(What's going on tonight)<br />What's going on, is this where I belong tonight?<br />(What's going on tonight)<br />What's going on, is this where I belong tonight?<br />(What's going on)<br /><br />(Can't stand) I can't stand the thought of losing<br />Sentences and every island of words<br />(Can't stand) I can't stand the thought of losing<br />Everything I ever thought I that I knew<br /><br /><br /><br />Wow I love this band. You should also listen to ""Hello Helicopter"" and ""Autographs &amp; Apologies""<br />or just any of their songs they are all so opinionated it makes me happy =]<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;"

"event","<p><font size=""4"">Soo i slept over my friend Brittany's house yesterday.<br />It was fun.&nbsp;<br />We went to Skateaway from 7-12 I saw a lot of people I knew [that I don't hate so much;]]<br />I had fun for once, but the whole ride there I was queasy on the whole account of anxiety.<br />Yes, I've come to the conclusion that I'm always anxious and always will be, same goes for nervousness.<br />But I found a better solution rather than biting my hands, writing songs I know the lyrics to, I mean it may affect my will to pay attention, but it works since I am able to sing the songs in my head.<br />There's this kid in my biology class who I'm attracted to, very attracted, maybe because he actually pays attention to me.<br />Although, there is a lot of kids I'm attracted to but I've decided only focus on the ones who are actually doing anything and acknowledging me.<br />I've noticed I haven't cursed, maybe this could work for me.<br />And about that person, at least this one has a MIND and an OPINION.</font></p>"

"event","&nbsp;It's been awhile since I've done this thing.
Nothings changed, I still remain opinionated,sick,bored, etc., etc.
I'm done with it.
all of it,
at least as of today.
I""m done caring, if there is something you need to say fucking say it.
Don't hold your tongue for me
Cause I""m sick of that.
I like hearing people's opinions it enhances my judgement.
And I sure as hell aren't going to talk to you first.
I need this ramble to make it through my week, pay no attention to the mixed up ideas and the fact that I've lost my train of thought a few words back."

so here goes...

moving: it's going to be happening soooooon. bye bye ghetto!

parents: mmmm, let's just say that things between the three of us couldn't get much better. why? because we no longer share the same living space. and i grew a brain.

sister: had a kid, and chilled out completely! i thought that having a baby would wind her up even more. i was wrong. along side my parents, she's become one of my best friends. not to mention, i LOVE LOVE LOVE my niece!!!

boys/friends/etc:

um, paul and i broke up in november. he still hates me, and i can't say i blame him.

stephen completed his two year mission, and now we are just as good of friends as ever, if not better, because we finally share the understanding that neither of us is going to budge on beliefs pertaining to faith. so now i'm basically his 1-800 ""what do i do about this that or the other girl"" hotline. it's been fun, and i'm glad to still have him as a good friend.

my good buddy logan moved to freakin' california, which kind of pisses me off, but i understand that he had to do what's best for him. hell, if i had the resources to move out of state, and weren't as attached at the hip to my family as i currently am, i'd probably leave as well.

new relationship in the works: kind of an odd situation, but it's going well (aka: couldn't get much better). and i think i'll leave it at that for now."

I realize there has been a lot of this lately, but the other day I ate my first hamburger in 8 years. Jack in the Box. It was good. It went down decently, in that I didn't suffer much pain. The next night I ate Dicks, and the whole rest of the night and next day it felt as though I had swallowed some sort of explosive device. I think that's why I stopped eating burgers in the first place... sensitive stomach.

In good news, I had an excellent weekend. People from Minnesota are awesome... never fails. I also encountered quite possibly the prettiest thing I've EVER seen in my entire 22, almost 23, years. There's no use in talking about it really, because you just couldn't/wouldn't understand until you've seen what I saw. I was knocked off my feet literally, and must go back SOON! Thankfully Washington has much more to offer than I had previously realized, or given  credit for. Shame.

"event","Gah, the bad news: I was so tired after work that I fell asleep. Consequently I missed/botched my plans for tonight... sorry guys! Yet again. :(

The good news: I got a job working weekdays 8:30-5 for an Appraisal Office in University Place. I started Wednesday. 

More good news: At least tonight I didn't have a weird dream about Paul holding hands with some random girl that I saw at Subway... like I did during yesterday's nap. I remember getting kind of annoyed about it, and him saying that I was overreacting because he didn't see why holding hands and cuddling with other people was a problem... which just disturbed me even more. heh. funny. or weird. I dunno. It seemed totally real. 

I think  that's it's just going to take a bit of time to adjust to this new schedule. After being able to sleep in and get up whenever I please for a couple of months, I think that my body is kind of in shock. 

I remember when I worked the same exact hrs. in the South Hill Mall Office that I was ALWAYS hanging out and doing fun stuff after work, so hopefully I'll get to that point again. If not, I'm officially an old hag. I guess I was only 18 at that point, but if 4 years makes that big of a difference, I'm screwed. 

Other than that. I consumed my first DONUT since age 14 today. Our bosses brought them for us, and I was hungry. The only problem was that any or all enjoyment that I got out of eating the thing was slightly outweighed by the anxiety/worry I encountered with each bite, and post consumption. The point was/is that it satiated me, and it's cool that I overcame the fear. I think I'll be able to do it again, though I still fear liking them too much and possibly getting carried away. I guess that's why work was a good environment to try. Go me."

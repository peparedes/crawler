Responsibilities.  My life.  Whatever isn't working for me at the moment, my first response a lot of the time is to run first, figure it all out later.

Okay, these days, I usually don't get the chance to run very far.  Robert E. Hobbes is a lot more tenacious in that department than Kevin or my aunt and uncle ever were.  But even Kev always found me, eventually, and pulled me out of whatever hidey hole I'd found for myself.

But, metaphorically, it's been a while since I ran like that.  I...I don't need to so much anymore.  Or I've gotten better coping skills, I'm not sure.  I mean, when everything in your life is hell anyway, there isn't much point in running, is there?

If we're talking literally running, though, that was this morning.  First after a perp, then from a perp.  The guy had a gun.  I should have expected the gun, but I didn't, and there it was.  One of these days, Hobbes is gonna have to give me weapons training.  And the Fatman is gonna have to authorize me a gun.  I'm not carrying a hammer around all the time, man."

...what, you want details? I tend to yell a lot. Just ask Hobbes. (Not that he doesn't do his fair share of yelling in stressful situations either.) I run away rather than try to cope. (Sometimes, running away *is* coping.) I go crazy. (Okay, that's not so much by choice. Most of the time.) I steal stuff. (Or at least, I used to. Now I just, like, swipe Eberts' stapler when he's not looking, and that's not so much a response to pressure as a way to *create* pressure because holy crap, Eberts does not like people messing with his office supplies.) These are the ways I respond to pressure.

...Okay, I respond in other ways too. Sometimes, they are even productive and get the job done. But, y'know? My life is pressure. Literally; I can feel it building in my head every few days, ticking away like the timer on an ugly blood-red bomb, if I don't get the switch that freezes the timer. It never quite stops it, but at least I can get that short reprieve.

<lj-cut>
*runs hand through hair*

That's, uh...that's a tougher question to answer than I expected.  I mean, I guess it might depend on your definition of sell-out.  Merriam-Webster, they're pretty circumspect in their definition: one who sells out.  They don't provide any connotative associations with that definition, do they?

The point where I sold out is when I gave my brother permission to stick a gland in my head that would turn me invisible, all so that I would get out of my prison sentence.  Which shouldn't have been my sentence in the first place, and when I *really* sold out was after my brother died and I went to work for his stupid Agency, but that was all blackmail from the Official anyway because if I didn't work for him I wouldn't get the counteragent that would stop me from going crazy every few days.

See?  It all depends on your definition.  Your context, maybe.  Some days, I really don't even feel like a sell-out.

<em>Talk about something cheerful.</em>

<lj-cut>
Oh, thank god, something *nice* for a change.  Right, something cheerful--

Aw, crap, surely I've got *some*thing cheerful I can say?

The other night after work, Hobbes and I were heading out to grab a bite somewhere, and we ran into Claire in the elevator.  We invited her along, and she said yes--she doesn't, most of the time, keeping (haha) herself to herself--so we ended up going somewhere a bit nicer than what Hobbes had probably been planning.  (Seriously, I think he goes out of his way to find the grossest dives in this city.  He probably thinks it's character-building or something.)  Italian place, low-key but with the candles on the tables and everything.  The food was really good, the wine tasted just right--and I'm way more of a beer guy than a wine guy--and we maybe accidentally helped shut the place down because we didn't notice what time it was.

It was--it was really, really good.  Sometimes I worry about my social life, or complete lack thereof what with the gland and all, and we all spend waaaay too much of our lives in each other's pockets every day as it is.  And there's been this whole--uh, thing--between Bobby, Claire and I since a certain incident a few weeks back...actually, a couple incidents in the past few months...well, yeah, it's maybe been a tiny bit awkward.  Sometimes.  Between the three of us.

But we just sat and talked, and laughed, and ate, and drank, and it was like we were all three perfectly normal human beings.  For us, that's pretty awesome.

I'm hoping we can do it again sometime.  Sometime.

Bobby Hobbes there, he was a genius for a while, though it didn't last.  Maybe that's where his true genius lay; he gave it up because knowledge without friendship wasn't worth it.

My brother was a genius.  He let his work, his drive, consume him.  Me--I think I'm talented.

The Keeper's tried her keychain crap on me, Hobbes has lectured me more times than many professors manage in a whole semester of lecturing, the Fatman has tried to teach me the errors of my ways--they have all in their own ways tried to redeem me too.  But them?  They've also recognized that actually, no, I'm not in need of redemption.  And me?  I've guess I've learned a few slightly more socially respectable ways to earn my keep."

The Fatman's always putting me onto cases with Hobbes that I'd rather avoid like they were a plague of locusts; Eberts is always forcing me into doing paperwork; Hobbes is always forcing me to do things for the job that I would rather just not do; Claire's always forcing me into taking tests, being poked, letting her take my blood.  I'd walk away but, y'know, none of them will <i>let</i> me.

And it was always the strangest feeling because--because on the one hand, I was hurt they wouldn't let me do what I do best (get in trouble, basically), and on the other I was embarrassed and angry because I actually <i>wanted</i> to get involved, and I just knew the Fatman would use that against me come the next time I said ""Oh hell no.""

I'm...pretty sure I'd never been asked that question before.  But I was watching one of those zombie movies, y'know, <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> or something, with Hobbes the other night.  It was two in the morning, it was the only thing on that wasn't an infomercial or <i>Loveboat</i> reruns (Hobbes wanted to watch those reruns, I know he did even if he didn't want to admit it, but I *refused*), neither of us could sleep and he'd somehow ended up at my apartment.  And he goes and asks me, after stealing another bite of popcorn (he'd *told* me he didn't want any, and then he kept eating out of mine.  Hmph).

So I told him.  ""Get an axe,"" I said, ""a flame-thrower--do you have any shotguns?--and camp out in a grocery store.""

""I wouldn't give you my shotguns,"" Hobbes retorted, and when he reached for the popcorn I slapped his hand.

""No, but I'd expect you to bring them with you to the grocery store,"" I told him.

""Oh.""  Hobbes sat up on the couch a little.  ""You'd really spend the zombie apocalypse with me?""

I shrugged and munched on popcorn.  ""Who else could I trust to get our asses through it?""

""That's so nice of you.""  Bobby honestly sounded like he could've cried.  ""We'd have to get Claire too.  She could probably come up with some chemical concoction to melt them or something.""

""Bleach,"" I said laconically.  ""They sell lots of bleach at grocery stores.""

By the end of the movie, we'd finished the popcorn and knew exactly how we'd handle our own zombie apocalypse.

Heh.  Uh...yeah.  How's <i>that</i> for an awkward question.  I'm an only child--now.  I sure as hell didn't grow up that way.

My brother Kevin, he was a couple years older than me.  Not much, but it was enough.  I suppose I was a classic baby brother, clowning around, getting in trouble, trying to draw attention to myself by goofing off.  Whatever.  Sometimes it worked.  

Kev, Kev was a genius.  Straight up, 100% pure, grade A genius.  I mean, he was thinking about genetic coding at the tender age of twelve, I swear.  Now, me, I'm smart.  I'm even on occasion clever.  But I am no frickin' genius.

But I was smarter than my brother.  Even he said so.

Kevin did something stupid.  He trusted somebody he shouldn't have--and I don't mean me, though I easily could have.  And he died.  He died in my arms and I had no chance whatsoever to save him.

So now I'm an only child.

What do <i>I</i> think?  What do I <i>think</i>?  I think it's the stupidest, crappiest, dumbest plan we've come up with yet, but who the hell cares what <i>I</i> think.

It relies on Chrysalis believing us--which, yeah, <i>that</i> happens so often--and it relies on split-second timing--which, okay, sometimes Hobbes and I are <i>beautiful</i> at the timing, but sometimes...not so much--and it relies on Monroe acting like she's going to the other side.  Which, when she heard *that* part of the plan?  I'm kinda surprised she didn't shoot Bobby right there and then, come to think of it.  Like I said, <i>Chrysalis has to believe us</i>.  Monroe's joining them does not exactly fit easily into something they'll find believable.

This is so going to end in tears.  Tears of <i>pain</i>.  Probably mine.  Hopefully not tears of pain because my invisible ass has been shot, but I'm not going to hold my breath on that one.  I only hope Claire is on hand to stitch me up again.

Of course, mine's been a little genetically engineered, and he started out as part of a lab experiment in invisibility.  I couldn't really stand to see us both being lab rats anymore, though, so I took him from Claire's little basement hideaway.

Hey, she's got me to experiment and run tests on now.  Why should she care?

(She does, though.  At least a little.  She still occasionally gets annoyed with me for stealing him.)

I wouldn't want another pet, though.  Claire's got all kinds of other critters in the lab--some of which I have no clue <i>why</i> <s>and thank god she got rid of the spider</s>, and she seems perfectly fine taking care of all of them.  Me, though, I'd hate all that responsibility.

I think I've safely proven I'm kinda crap with having too much responsibility.

The usual reasons not to have a pet totally apply to me--I'm rarely home, I wouldn't be able to give the little guy--whatever species he might be--the proper care he deserves, yadda yadda.  More unusual reasons apply too, like my life being in constant danger and I don't even want to think what I would do if I went quicksilver mad around it.

"event","Okay, see now, I hate it when I come into the middle of things.

Like, take yesterday for instance.  I slouch into work at my usual time when not in the middle of something big (and good God you do *not* want to hear how often Hobbes has complained about my usual time of coming into work, but seriously, what does he expect from an ex-thief?), and I made my way to the Official's office because that's what I usually do--I go to his office, or the Keep's lab, or Bobby's office.  

Actually, I don't have an office.  This is why I have to go bug everybody else.  Do any of them think of that?  No.  I bet if they got me an office, I would get into way less trouble than I do currently snooping around in everybody else's business.

...Okay, I suck at lying.  This is why I was a thief and not a conman.

Anyway.  So I go to the Fatman's office, and I can hear him and Eberts in there, and a couple other voices, so I immediately do the quicksilver shimmer because, hey, it's not like anybody around here tells me anything of their own volition.  (Yeah, there really is no point in giving me an office; I'd never hang out there anyway.)

The problem is, of course, the doors are closed.  And just because I'm invisible doesn't mean I can walk through walls.  I should ask the Keep about that sometime.  Huh.

Right, so, I don't knock on the door because I've used that trick before and Eberts has a really good memory.  I'm leaning up against the door, trying to listen in and think about how I can get myself in there when the door opens, I almost fall on top of somebody, and Eberts starts stammering.  

The Fatman bellows, I push myself away, the new guy looks confused, Eberts ushers him out blushing like a fire engine, and practically before the door even hits Eberts on the ass on his way out the Official is yelling at me.

So, the point of all this?  I'm up to my neck in Canadian terrorists--<i>again</i>--Eberts is doing unnatural things to my paycheck, Hobbes is sulking because he thinks I got all this secret information about the mission that he didn't, and all because I got into the conversation at the last minute.

Well, no, I would've been stuck with the Canadian terrorists no matter what but it would have been <i>nice</i> to be <i>asked</i> first, rather than land on the Canadian diplomat and scare the crap out of him."

<lj-cut>
Huh.  I've had a lot of really long days (in such a short life)--lots and lots of all-nighters and not getting any sleep for, like, 48 hours or whatever.  Yeah, I've done all that.

I think the longest day of my life, though, was one of the ones for which I spent the shortest amount of time awake.  As an adult, anyway.  I mean, I really liked to sleep a lot as a kid.

Anyway.

It was the day Kevin and his gang of scientists (seriously, these people were a gang) operated on me.  Longest day of my life, it really was.  I mean, my brother sprung me out of jail by making me his guinea pig; I was not exactly sanguine about the whole experience going into it, y'know what I mean?

So he gets me out, and he picks me up in this stupid old van with a bunch of federal goons in black suits, and--the whole thing is ridiculous.  I'm nervous, right, because Kevin won't tell me a damned thing, and I'm cranky, I admit, because I can't take any of it seriously when I'm stuck in the back of a <i>van</i> that's from the '70s or '80s sometime.  What the hell was I getting myself into?  Why the hell wouldn't my brother tell me?  How bad <i>was</i> this crap, anyway?  That drive out to the lab was fricking endless.

And then Kevin takes me into the lab (which, by the way, was <i>way</i> more high-tech and cool-looking than the van) and introduces me to his gaggle of scientists (they were a gaggle <i>and</i> a gang, alright?), including Arnaud, and then--and then I'm out.  Anesthetized.  Pretty much, anyway, for the operation, and--

It was awful.  It didn't take my brother long to get me out of jail, just a few days, but I've never been all that great at waiting, and that day, the actual day that he got me out and put me under--it really, really sucked.  Endless, like I said.

I hope to get this gland out of my head.  I hope to maybe see my dad again sometime, try to get a little more information out of him about his life.  I hope to figure out what the hell is going on with my life and take some more control over it.  Every day I hope Bobby's taken his pills, that the Keeper is in a good mood, that <i>Monroe</i> is in a good mood, that the Fish doesn't feel like toying with me, that Eberts can cook the books enough to keep the electricity and water running.  Sometimes I hope that Arnaud dies with my hands around his scrawny neck, other times that he just dies, however I have to go about making it happen.  I hope I can see my Aunt Celia around the holidays, and maybe my grandma too, if she'd like that.  I hope that I can pick up this particular hair product that I really like but is kinda hard to find.

That ranks pretty high up there.  <s>Of course, then she died, which sucked a lot, but apparently it doesn't take away from the embarrassment factor.</s>  Oh, oh, I got kidnapped by an acupuncturist once because my back was <i>killing</i> me and she found out I could turn invisible.  How's that for really pathetically embarrassing?  And let's not even talk about the many and myriad ways having an invisibility gland at the wrong moment can make for some really awkward and difficult-to-explain conversations.  

Those are all just in the past year or less.  I refuse to go into the stupid crap I pulled in my previous life."

<lj-cut>
I had to tell my Aunt Celia that my brother Kevin was dead.  My relationship with my family has always been pretty--crappy; none of us have been very good at being a family.  When Kevin died, I--I didn't tell anyone.  I didn't--

There are things you're supposed to do, right, when somebody you care about dies.  You take care of the body, and you notify the rest of the family, and you hold a funeral and people for some reason give you casseroles, crap like that.  At least, that's what other people have told me, and I've seen that kind of thing on tv, and I think that's what happened when my mom died when I was a little kid.  At least, I remember a lot of casseroles and a lot of old people I'd never seen before wearing black and patting me on the head.  I pretty much hated it.

I didn't do any of that for Kevin.  I left him lying there in his blood for Arnaud to find and I ran.  I mean, yeah, I kinda had to run, since I was in the early stages of quicksilver madness and Arnaud was after my ass--or rather, my brain--but, jeez, it's a crappy way to treat your dead older brother.  I buried him, eventually--actually, the Agency did--but, hell, it was screwed up.

And I never told Aunt Celia what happened.  She'd raised Kev'n'me, and after the Official found me and I got saddled working for the Agency with Hobbes, I just--I never contacted her.  I just sort of shut down anything that had to do with Kevin, maybe; I dunno, I don't understand grief and the way it operates.

So when I finally went to visit her in her little senior living community thing, and she said I'd just missed seeing Kevin, it was kind of a shock, you know?

It wasn't Kevin, of course; it was some stupid plot of Arnaud's, but after it was all done and I re-buried my brother, I finally went back to Celia to tell her what had happened.

I never want to have to do something like that again.  Aunt Celia isn't a bad old girl; she was always a bit--distant, with me, when I was a kid, but she was my mother's older sister and she loved me, and she loved Kevin, and having to tell her that her only other nephew was dead was pretty painful.  She hadn't expected it, would never have expected geeky-scientist-Kevin to die so young, and I couldn't even give her all the details about how and why it happened.

I've had to tell a number of people somebody died, or something happened that was going to really, really ruin their day.  I made my friend Bobby give up being a genius, and I've had to tell Claire an awful lot how much I screwed up and in what ways.  But the worst time of it I've had was talking to Aunt Celia.

(Yeah, you don't know many people who can actually say that and <i>mean</i> it, do you?)

When I'm invisible, it's almost like seeing in black and white.  It's more like--like varying shades of white, and black, and silver (hey, it's not called quicksilver for nothing, right?).  I wonder if maybe that's the way some people dream?  I used to always dream in color, before I got the gland.  And I still do, most of the time.  But sometimes...

It's a little weird.  The world's a little, um, flatter, not quite as three-dimensional.  It took my depth perception a while to get used to it, too; at first I had some problems with things being closer than I expected, or a little bit more to one side.  (Kevin had a field day with crap like that, back at the lab when he ran me through three million and one tests.)  And I think there's a bit of synaesthesia going on there too, or maybe it's just because my core body temperature does get lower when I'm invisible because the whole world feels colder when I'm seeing in quicksilver vision.  (And no, it can't just be my body temp 'cause I feel that way even when I've only quicksilvered my eyes; I still feel colder...I suppose I should mention that to Claire one of these days.  Probably.  Unless I mentioned it to Kevin, way back when?  I probably did.  He asked a lot of questions back then.)

Yeah.  I wouldn't recommend the whole black and white vision thing to people.  It's just <i>weird</i>."

And not just me--Hobbes, my partner; hell, even Claire, my Keeper.  We've got dangerous jobs here; even the Official and Eberts aren't immune to the dangers.  

I've lost so many relationships over the years.  More than that, I've lost my freedom more than once--I've been in jail; I'm in a strange sort of prison now, due to the gland in my head.  I lost my first set of lucky lockpicking tools; I had my third set confiscated by the police.  A lot of my stuff from when I was a little kid, really small, got lost in the shuffle after my mom died and Kevin and I moved in with our aunt and uncle.  Stuff <i>happens</i>.  You lose things.  You lose people.  There's nothing you can do about it, just make it last as long as you can and make it the most enjoyable, the most memorable, that you can.

Very much a part of his private life.

But this, this was just after that whole thing with the super-genius drug, and stuff was kinda hinky between us because of it, awkward for the partnership, y'know?  Even if we tried to act like everything was cool, there was still this underlying base line of weirdness.

So Bobby invited me over to watch the game with him, and we were just sitting on his couch, talking crap about the game afterward.  We'd both had a lot of beer, and it was pretty late, and Bobby went to throw some of the cans away and I...kinda fell asleep on his couch.  I seriously didn't mean to; I just closed my eyes for a second and then woke up, like, four hours later.  Hobbes had thrown a blanket over me.  I'd drooled on it.  I didn't mention that to him when I handed it to him the next morning.

But everything after that was fine.  And Bobby's fallen asleep on my couch a couple times since then, when a case had us working really late and I told him not to bother going home.  I mean, hey, it's not like I really have a private life anymore to keep secret from my co-workers.

I don't think it's an appropriate response; I think it's a frigging inescapable response when you're in my shoes.  Screw reality; I go insane.  Regularly.  At least once a week.  At least they haven't had to put me in the padded room lately.

Lately.

I want some sanity in my life again.  I want not to wake up with an invisibility gland curled up in my head like a tiny little time bomb that goes off every few days giving me red eyes, voices in the back of my head, and the meanest temper you've ever seen.  I want to be <i>normal</i> again--as normal as I ever was, which, granted, wasn't very normal, but at least it was <i>my life</i>.

My reality is that I go insane.  And there's nothin' I can do about it."

Honestly?  I'm not sure anyone is winning.  I think we're all at an impasse--right now, at least.  And maybe just over the long haul.  Guys like Chrysalis, or Arnaud, or the Chinese--the people trying to grab me, use me, use my gland--sometimes they get ahead of us.  Of me.  Sometimes they get a hold of me, sometimes they get away before we can snatch them.  And they always think they're winning anyway, that they're so damned superior and in control.

I don't believe 'em.

I don't think anybody's in control.  Not the Fatman, not Chrysalis, not even No-Name guy.  I think they all just <i>wished</i> they were in control.  And therefore winning.  Me, I know better.  After the way things have gone down in my life--after the choices I have made and after the choices I never got to make--I know there's no such thing as control or winning.

We're at an impasse, all of us.  In balance, or something, over the long term--so one minute Chrysalis seems to be in the lead, the next, I dunno, those freakin' Free Quebec Canadian terrorists.  But we're not, none of us.  We're just...pretending we know what we're doing.

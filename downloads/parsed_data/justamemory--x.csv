"event","<p><font color=""#ff0000"" size=""5"">i dont like dean anymore!<br /><br /><font color=""#00ff00"" size=""3"">that was prolly one of thee hardest things i have ever done. it took me 8 months but&nbsp;i am finally over him. er at least what in my mind is considerd being over him.&nbsp;<br /><br />i am finally at thee point where if he broke up with sara&amp;&amp;wanted to get together with me. i wouldnt even have a second thought about what my answer would be. id say no. i never thought id ever say that. me&amp;&amp;him together is never ganna happen. no matter how bad either of us would want it. if we were together it would just be a big mistake.&nbsp;<br /><br />it took a loong time but i have finally convinced myself that he never loved me. maybe buecause i think its thee truth. maybe becasue i want to think it is so it will be easier to let go. but i have myself convinced. i made myself not talk to him or ignore him if he talked to me. so he could know hwat i felt like&amp;&amp;so i could just move on. when i did talk to him i said as little as possible. everytime i would let something big slip...he would stop talking. fucking dicked. i kept telling myself that he was evil&amp;&amp;was lying&amp;&amp;he never even cared about me. well i finally believe it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />i honestly think that i am better off without him.&nbsp;<br /><br />my mate karl from england is making a ""lets send rina to england fund"" &amp;&amp;hes got $7 already. :] dean never made me a ""lets send rina to england fund"" i told him about it. &amp;&amp;he was liek ""ah cool"" after everyting we went threw i get a ""ah cool""? fucking dicked. thats what i have to say. so when i do go to england..im planing on not telling him. not like hed care anyways.&nbsp;<br /><br />but so me&amp;&amp;samiiface are not on good terms at thee moment. we were in school&amp;&amp;i was talking about something or another&amp;&amp;no one was paying attention to me so i was mad&amp;&amp;samiiface kept saying that she was. when she was obviosuly not. so i was like ""FINE WHATEV! I HATE YOU!"" &amp;&amp;i walked away..but i was kidding. so i find manda&amp;&amp;we see samiiface&amp;&amp;im like ""YOUR MEAN!"" &amp;&amp;shes like ""GET A LIFE!!"" so im like pft wahatev fuck her! in my head of course. so in choir she doesnt talk to me so i ignore her. &amp;&amp;she writes me this note later&amp;&amp;is all like::<br /><br />""rina, you make no sense to me sometimes. you will talk to amy in your guys class but you wont talk to me&amp;&amp;i didnt do anything. i hate when you say i am not listening when you are talking becasue i am always listening. just because i dont say anything doesnt mean that i wanst listening. and im not thee one that said your stories were pointless. i can forgive you and talk to you after thee whole jeremy thing but you cant forgive me for so called not listening to you. sometimes i wonder if you know how much that whole thing hurt me. and everything i start to think about last summer i just want to cry and sometimes i do. and you know as much as i do what would have happend if shelly hadnt been there. i will admit that i was crying durring this note. i wish and hope that it ment something to you.""<br /><br />i really love how she always brings up thee jeremy thing. no matter what happens she always brings it up. &amp;&amp;how bad i hurt her. she thinks that i ment to hurt her. BULLSHIT. i didnt want it to happen. i knew it was wrong..but i really cant take it back. i bet i could apologize about a billion times&amp;&amp;it still wouldnt be good enough for her.&nbsp;<br /><br />thee pain that she felt then..double that&amp;&amp;its what i have been feeling&nbsp;in thee last like 2 years. since i have&nbsp;met i dean i&nbsp;have felt &nbsp;so much pain...but also so much love. i never thought i could feel so much pain&amp;&amp;so much love in my life. i dont even remember what it felt like to be with dean anymore. tis just a distant memory. i wouldnt take any of it back tho. im still glad that i met him. i just wish things wouldnt have ended thee way they did. maybe if he wouldnt have changed we would still be together. we will never know.<br /><br />xoxo<br /><br /></font></font></p>"

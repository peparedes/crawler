"event","I am saddened I just had to write out care instructions for Ray. Someone from Marks work wanted to take her for me. I know it's a good thing, because she wasnt being cared for properly here, not that it's anybody's fault... just that it was always a massive fight to get my mum to take me to buy her crickets, so she would go a few days without food. and I would feel guilty. It's not like my mum even agreed to let me have her, she was a gift, and Paul asked my dad, who said yes without consulting her, so Ray was supposed to stay at his house, but I stopped going, and she was stuck in Kemptville for a few weeks, and when I got her back she was really sick and almost died. She lost her tail too, it was grose, it grew back though. so that's happy. kinda. Anyway, I dont want to think about it right now. 
I have discovered that both washing and brushing my hair makes it nice... it's weird, it's straight and soft, and nice... I like it. even my bangs are being agreeable. It must be a sign of the apocolips.. i know I spelled it wrong! 

I am sick with cabin fever. Not that I want to be at work or school, I just want to go out and do something, but I have to babysit Jordan and it's not like I have any money to do anything anyway. I like my computer now that it is internety again. It gives me a happy. So does this song, it's funny. You must all listen to it. I mean comeon If I were gay I would give you my hole (whole) being! 
another time, another scene I'd be right behind you, if you know what I mean. ^_- giggle. It's almost dirty. ok well I'm going to go check if Lost will be on tonight. 

I have decided to take a bunch of pictures of Ray and post them. Then I will have a live journal goodbye party, to which you are all invited... to say goodbye. forever... not gonna cry. ToT i need a hug"

He totally installed my internet chip wrong, because he is dumb, but he told me he did it right, so i believed him and threw a stink about the soft ware... not that it matters anymore, now I have fast happy internet! I dont ever have to leave my room again, until i run out of coke that is. Oksoyes, People are going to Stephanee's new years party dealum? I would personally love the chance to get out of the house, If you dont know about this yet, she sent around an email... but it said she invited a bunch of people whose email's/ phone numbers she didnt know.. so yes. That was kind of weird. and I have nothing else to say, so now I will get my bearshare/kazaa and re-download hours and hours of happy music ^_^ so happy. i luv my mommy for being not stupid."

"event","Sigh... I feel homey. I had to bake cookies for Jordans school christmas thing. After I cleaned up dinner... then I sat at the table and read for about an hour, and did some homework, then I cried for a bit and had a bath, now I feel blah. mark brought me coke... good old mark, i dont feel sad anymore, just, blah. everything is depressing, which is wrong because it's christmas, I did my secret santa dealum... not to give it away or anything, but are there 1 or 2 n's in Jena/Jenna... 1 i think. sounds right. anyway, sam and mom are at that meeting, thing for making your teenagers not crazy, but it turns out that she's like the only one there over 13... there are 2 boys there who pissed in the sanctuary of a chapel. so while mums off saving samantha's sanity, I have to stay here with Jordan. It's not that bad, he's just playing video games, I'm probably just stressed, alot. .... I'm trying to be positive though, only 3 1/2 more days of school I dont have to work again until Saturday... that's happy. Murray comes home on friday and I have a nifty picture of Dominic Monaghan being cute for my display pic. <3 I'm gonna go now, Mum should be home soon and I still have to get Jordan to bed. See people tomorrow. Much love."

"event","OMFG I have accomplished the impossible. I looked fat in an X-ray. I'm going to cry, it was so horrible, I should have just stayed in bed. OK so, first were told to wait in the horrible little room, with a t.v. playing the little mermaid and an aquarium. Then we had to ""follow the duck feet"" to the x-ray waiting room. Then I had to sit in a hall until a weird guy came and brought me to a room, told me to strip and handed me a blue hospital gown. Then I got to sit out in the hall, in my trendy new hospital gown, with my ass hanging out and all. Then I went in to a room, the guy took about an hour to position me, then six seconds to take two x-rays. SO that was fine, follow the duck feet back to the little room. Lead into another littler room, with a massive window and a sigh on the door sayimng Examination room, do not enter. ... I'll leave that to your imagination. Anyway, about 20 minutes later a really really HOT intern guy comes in and tells me to undo the back of my uber trendy hospital gown and touch my toes. At any other time with would be great, but I had a few problems with it. 1. an old moldy doctor was sitting there beside him, 2. My mom was sitting beside him, watching the hot intern, and 3. there was (as I mentioned before) a massive open window beside me. ... not like a regular window, like a wall of window, which probably wasnt the best idea for an ""examination room"" anyway, that happens, twice. Then they put up the x-rays and i looked fat. the doctor pointed out that x-rays dont see thin tissue, ie fat, and that it was the hospital gown, but it still looked fat. And you could see my boobs, they were white. Anyway, apparently I have not one but 2 curves in my spine now. one is 10 degrees and the other is 17... but the doctor, who i really didnt like at this point said they dont but a brace on you unless your at 20 degrees. I was kinda thinking that 17 and 10 is 27 degrees which is enough for surgery... but anyway. So basically I waited 6 months for a hot intern to see x-rays of my fat and stare at my nudity for 20 minutes, then a doctor to tell me that i have 2 curves and he isnt going to do anything about it. He didnt even say if it would go away... so my mum's pretty pissed about that and I was humiliated... alot. so that was fun and now I have a headache. Omg... I kept it together really well, (no pun intended)while the hot intern guy was there, then he left for a minute and i totally fell over, and screamed alot. Then my mom was laughing at me because apparently I went beat beat red. I'm quite proud of myself for not bursting into tears once. ... should have though, in hindsight. anyway. i hate cheo. fucking fish. OK I'm sure I have hours of homework I should be neglecting. hope you all enjoyed my humiliation as much as i did."

Anyway, Sarah called me and asked me to babysit for her, it meant being picked up from work, going directly to her house, then staying over night and being dropped off at work again. It's worse than that, I told my mom I couldnt do it, so she told me I shouldnt have told Sarah i could, but then she decided to go for me, but I wasnt sure if she was so I asked her to pick me up from work, and now here i am, sunday morning awake, listening to Jordan kill little plastic things with more little plastic things, mounds of homework in my room that wont even be thought of until at the earliest 9:30 tonight. Oh and that $80 backpay that Kelli said I had, she made a mistake... $8.00 couldnt see the decimal maybe? anyway, I am now making a grand total of $6.65, up from $6.55 ... ...

teehee, ok so on an entirely opposite subject. I have, in my recent depressed-ness compiled a list of what's wrong with my life. (enjoy) 
 
 1. Samantha has supreme power over my life and doesnt know it. That one requires a bit of an explination, basically, my parents can not handle her agression and anger any more, so Murray is threatening to leave, for good if she doesnt ""straighten out"". Samantha has no idea. If Murray leaves my life becomes work and possibly school, i would have to work and give mum all my money, we would have to move to an apartment, and it would be me (maybe not) Mum and Jordan, mark and (sam) would go to dad's Mark because he wouldnt really mind, Sam because they're also threatening to kick her out. And for the firdt time in my life I am wittnessing my mother actually becomming depresed, which can not happen, I could always handle things like this because she was so strong. 

 2. I am supposed to have sold ray by tomorrow, today i found out that the person who was buying her changed her mind. I cant find her a home, and apparently if I dont, my mum will. It doesnt mean she's find her a home by the way. So on that note. If anyone reading this can take Ray, even just for a while until i find her a home, or wants her, or know someone who possible wants a gecko, please let me know. Please. I'm desperate. 

 3. I hate my job, (you'll notice these get steadily less drastic as the list continues, I did that on purpose so I dont kill myself when I finish. This one is change-able, I am applying at Zellers, which as sad as it is, looks like utopia right now. In the meantime, I am earning $6.55 an hour and have to leave my house to walk to work at 7:30 am on saturday. 

 4. Big massive ancient civ project is due on Oct 28. So far, we have nothing. (Tasha, what are you doing sunday?)

 5. I have to be at school tomorrow at like 8:15 to choose my sumative subject. 

 6. I have to go to my mothers stupid stupid evil therapist of death tomorrow to talk about 1st how I've done my chorse and am good then 2nd how samantha hasnt and is bad, then 3rd how samantha is stressed and another 45 minutes of her and my mother either crying or being pissed at eachother and yelling, to be continued for the next few days. 

OK I think that's it. Tomorrow, I am going to Bayshore with Lesley to distribute resume's and applications for the better job ness. OK so here it is, big scary math time

ahem Tim's: $6.55 an hour plus tips which no one gives us and which we wouldnt get to keep even if someone did give them to us because someone has been stealing money, lots of money, so that comes out of our tips, and if not our pay. 
For an 8 hour shift at TIm's you get two 15 minute breaks
for 6 hours you get two 10 minutes
For 5 hours you get one 10 minute
and less than five is nothing at all...
so anyway 6.55 x 22 hours a week = $144 a week = $266 a paycheck = $576 a month 
Working at Tim's by march I will have enough to pay for Italy and pay back tasha the $1000 (For which I am eternally in her debt and incredibly grateful ^_^!!!!!!!!!!!!) I iwll have about $200 left

Now... Zellers: starting at $7.67 an hour plus no crappy hairnet, barely a unifor, (red shirt and black pants) and I'd be allowed to wear jewellery ^_^
8 hour shift One hour and two 15 minute breaks
7 hour shift one half hour and a 15 ( i think)
6 hour shift "" ""
ok well the point is many more breaks... many. and less back hurting physical labour. 
Now for the ebst part. $7.67 x 22 = 168 a week = $337 a paycheck =$674 a month
At Zellers working the same # of hours as at time, by march and after paying the remaining $1600 for Italy and Tasha's $1000 I will have $587. 84 ^_^ see what I mean about the Utopia thing... so that's the new plan. And I have a really legit reason for leaving Tim's not just like ""well *twirls hair and blows a bubble* I didnt really like, like the people, and They like wanted me to work and stuff *giggle"" sigh. Ok well must go do homework now, I still have to research for my summative thing. I feel better now. oh, Big REMINDER:PLEASE ANYONE WHO CAN TAKE OR STASH MY GECKO FOR A WHILE OR WANTS HER, SHE CAN BE FREE, I JUST WANT HER TO BE TAKEN CARE OF PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!"

So now, on top of school and working which btw amounts to an average of at least 52 hours a week, not including homework, i get to empty my garbage, not when it's full though, when it get's to be 3/4 full, because that's the way mum likes it. Then in the morning I get to get up half an hour earlier and clean the kitchen, bring down all my laundry, make my bed and tidy up my clothes. Then I get to go to school for 6 hours, then I go straight to work for an average of 5 hours then I come home at about 9:30, re clean the kitchen and do homework, then go to bed and get up at 6:30 the next day to do it all over again. Unless ofcourse I'm really lucky and it's the weekend! then I get to get up at 5 am go work for 8 hours, do homeowrk, collapse, get up at 5 again work for 8 hours, then come home clean some more then get ready to go back to school. That will be my life. god i am so angry. but of course none of that matters because what's really important is me doing some house work. not that I'm so exhausted I'm ready to drop, not that I all of a sudden have a massive project due with in three weeks, or that I have to work as much as i am to pay back people, and pay for my trip, and even if I make enough to cover the enire thing my mum will still be pissed off at me when I dont have $800 in december. It's not even the chores that piss me off so much, it's that the only reason she dragged sam and I in there was so she could have someone else say it, so she could say ""See I told you so"" she did it so she could gang up on us. I feel completely betrayed, and she's all happy because she manipul;ated everything again to make her world better. I get that she wants the first house she's owned to be all perfect, but that's all i've ever heard from her. as long as i keep something clean I'm worthy enough to be in her presence. god it's so stupid. she didnt need to drag us there to make us get it. I havent been home long enough to clean anyhting in a month, and If i have I'm either in pain or completely exhausted. Then stupid Murray putting in his 2 cents, tells me that I can make it better by stretching and not thinking about it. and that essentially my laziness is why I'm in pain, and that if i would just get off my ass and stretch or excercise It would all be better. He can kiss my ass. God I'd give anything to have the time to be lazy. my only ray of light is that I dont have to start work until 9 am next saturday, how pathetic is that. ok i no longer have the energy to sit here and type, or hte time for that matter, i have to go clean the kitchen and empty the garbages and wash my uniform for work, then maybe even have a shower. then i think i'll do some homework if I'm still conscious."

""uh from work"" 
*this is about the time I woke up* 
""Oh, hello, how are you?"" 
""Fine.... um what were you doing?"" 
""Sleeping"" 
""Shouldnt you be getting ready for school?"" *hint hint*
*just a little break in here, KISS MY ASS KELLI, I ALREADY HAVE MORE HIGHSCHOOL THAN YOU* 
""Probably"" 
""OK well Mark is sick, so can you come in for a shift after school today?"" 
""..."" this is gonna be a little complicated so bare with me *POOF* shoulder angel, ""You should go to school then go to work and be successful and happy and prosperous"" *POOF!* shoudler devil, ""Bah on school, bah on work, BAH TON THE WORLD I SAY!!!! MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.... ahem, yeah, hang up on her"" 
""BEthany?"" 
""Uh, sure I cant come in"" 
""Great"" *thinking: maybe she isnt such a little shit after all, she still missed one shift and DID call in even though Moe was too much of a selfrichious little prick to bother telling anyone else in a desperate attempt to ,make him feel better about himself because he never graduated highschool and is still working at Tim Hortons at 38"" .... ok so maybe some of that is my own bitterness. I'm sure she was thinking that anyway. Moe is a prick... stupid moe... bastard. 
""oK well I'll not see you tonight, becasuse I""m a manager, which makes me special..."" *That's what I tell myself... I'm lonely* 
*Inner Bethany: heh heh heh, stupid kelli..* ok so yes back to the rest of today.
Walking to school with mark, I dont remember most of that, I think I almost passed out a few times. Then I went to ancient civ. Tasha wasnt there, stupid tasha, saw Dan, he didnt make fin of me, I think because I looked like shit, or death, somehow I'm sure that makes sence. Anyway, I saw anne for the for time in like a month! not really a month but you get it. then I walked home, I actually have no idea how I made it home, I really dont, all I know is I got home possible said something to Murray, then i collapsed on my bed and woke up at 2:30, so then I did nothing for an hour then I went to work and now i am home and tired... and yeah. anyone who is extremely bored, can google Quontum Touch (sp?) anyway, I had that done and now I am all woogy, so I will go. If you figure out what it is, let me know, I'm both curious and lazy. It will be my downfall. conflict of interests... teehee. OK so bye ^_^

"event","*yawn* so not tired... it's amazing, I feel not very tired, last night was the first and last time I got eight hours of sleep until like march. Btw yes I am supposed to be at work.. and no i dont care that I'm not, it wont even sffect my paycheck until nect month, and by then I will be working like 4 shifts a week so meh. Omg I called at 7:00 this morning, which was when I was supposed to be starting, and it's not like I'm just sitting around because I want to and I'm lazy, that's only like half of it, ok but for some reason, I've had the same headache for the past four or five days, and it's starting to wear me down, that and I was having crippling woman... pains all day at work yesterday. wasnt much fun. and for my part, i havent even opeend my backpack yet to do my homework, which is in abundance. sigh. so the point being, I really am sick, but since my mum is out of town, I told Manager MOe that I had to watch Jordan today. I dont know why but I just have a problem with telling people I dont know well that I'm sick, I'd rather lie entirely than have to try to convince Mohammed that I really am not feeling well. He's an ass anyway, i'm only 15 and I already have more education then him. I dont think any of the managers there actually finished highschool, I know this because 1. everyone praises Ruby for going back to high school, she's like 20 something, and the other managers all have like 2 sons and none of them look much older than 30. Except Mohammed, he is probably a virgin. I just have to tell my mum not to go to pick me up on her way back from Montreal and all is good. I will call her soon, or she will probably call some time today anyway so I am good, unless she gets all pissed at me. which she probably will. ok, now I must go eat a bottle of advil and maybe sleep."

If I can work 24 hours a week and do NOt spent a dime, I will have enough to pay back my friends, pay for the rest of the trip and have aprox $300 left over for extran expences and maybe spending money. first I will pay back Sarah and Joy... next friday I get payed, so they will have $ on monday... ok then after that it's like entirely saving up Tasha's $1000. and payments to my mum for the next $800 payment thingie.. ok so I will be broke for about 5 months, but I should be clear by the end of March and... yes. so Yay! omg I've never even been out of the country... I dont think Tasha has either, now I'm all eternally in her debt and stuff. I think Anne has only been to the states and back. I havent talked to her really in like 3 or 4 days.

I got my schedule ""fixed"" aka now my semester consists of ancient civ, *MATH*, chemistry and english, then next semester will be spare, photography, biology and peer teaching. which means i am guaranteed 4 classes worth of homework a night on top of atleast 16 hours of working a week, and I'm only confident i can pass two of the four subjects i have this semester. so yay. this will be fun. hoorah, my mum is home, i'm not sure if i am being sarcastic... i dont think so, time will tell. anyway, i've got to go sleep, bye ^_^"

"event","Gonna cry... right now, big sobbing anguishy crying. God i hate everything. Except mark, I love him, he is going to the corner store to buy me coke because I am sad. I tried talking to my mum again about the whole not working at Tim's any more, she mnostly ignored me and watched home and garden telivision... (aka the devil) then said sopmething like no you cant quit, it' good for you to have a jopb, and it helps me financially, then i told her oi didnt have the time or energy to keep it, and she ignored me, called Jordan for a bath and the phone rang, it was murray. and god know's the world stops for him. stupid everything, i dont want to work this weekend, all weekend, I want to sleep in and do some homework and go out with my friends and do nothing. but instead I get to spend 16 hours at tim hortons. that leaves 32 hours for being not at Tim's then a reccomended 8 hours of sleep a night, so 16 hours to be conscious, then according to the planner we are supposed to spend 2 hours a night on homework, so that leaves me with approx 12 hours to do what I want to out of 48. more importantly i am exhausted, I have been for several days, i'm tired, i cant sleep, i've had the same headache for three days now, and, and now i'm crying, stupid everything. god i hate my life. and once again if you can believe it my mother is completely oblivious, bathing Jordan, watching Home and Garden telivision, pretending everything is happy and great. I mean as badly as I want to quit, I probably wouldnt given the opportunity, just for a while so I could atleast think I had tried to do it all but i just couldnt. but stupid my mom, god all I really wanted her to do was acknowledge that it is as bad as i'm making it out to be, and i dont actually *have* to do it if i cant. no teacher will accept something late if i tell then i was working, guaranteed, every time they will look you straight in the face and tell you school comes before work. great... tell that to my mother, better yet, murray, who tires to control everything in the universe from the front lawn. he;s so frustrating, he actually thinks he know's everything, about everything that ever existed, granted he's educated, screw it never mind, this will accomplish nothing and i'm too tired to stay here and think about all this crap. night."

"event","Ok so... my evening. 
Working, Serge makes me laugh a few times, he is cute... all is relatively well. 
Serge leaves, I am stuck at store front for 4 hours, which sucks... the Goeff from antrho last year comes in with cute friend. cute friend orders one timbit very slowly, because I told them I was bored... cute, then he tips me like 50 cents. very cute. nice blond hair, nice blue eyes, swoon. Then they left to go play pool, then they came back, and cute friend asks me when I'm off, Soon?... not till 11. Ooh, ok... leaves. working working working... 9 pm, sarah leaves insane rush, only 3 ppl working to deal with it. 9:30 rush ends, funny girl from anne's anthro class comes in, (the one who was always telling you about her sex life) she was funny, she kinda stood there for a minute before saying, ""Sorry, I'm a bit stoned..."" she takes the prize, she even beat out the woman who asked for a tin of french vanilla, a dozen donut box to put it in, an empty cup and lots of tape. still trying to figure that one out. anyway, 10: 50 cute friend comes back alone... ""HEY"" 
""Hey, where's Goeff?"" 
""Broken que, he stole the balls to play pool and I told him I wanted nothing to do with it so I left, he said he's meet me here in a few minutes"" 
*cute honest*
""So what are you doing after your shift?"" 
""I have to go home"" 
""dont want to come play pool with me... and Goeff?"" 
*Mental freak out* ""No I cant"" 
""Why not?""
""... grounded?""
""What for?""
""...drinking?""
""Really?"" 
""Yeah"" 
""I dont drink, I dont need booze to have a good time"" 
*swoon*
""I do... jk"" 
cute little laugh,
""Well that sucks"" 
awkward silence. 10 minutes pass of working, I leave get changed, come out, ""Oh, hey, you look different, with your hair down"" 
*BLUSH* suddenly notice he's a bit shorter that me... that's ok
five semi-awkward minutes
Mark arrives, looks like he wants to tear his head off... goeff arrives, less awkward, Mark know's Goeff... few more minutes pass, starting to wish I hadnt made him think, I was a raging alcaholic. i also kinda wish I had found out his name, I bet it's a good name. Adam I think... that's a good guess. not sure why. anyway then we left, and I am home, slightly less depressed, but kindof still, i hate me... i can totally be myself around guys until I get the slighttes incling that he might like me, then it all goes out the window, even if I wouldnt have liked him anyway, honestly this guy liked me in my Tim Hortons uniform for god's sake. sigh. anyway, who wants to get drunk tomorrow? i will call people in the afternoon, my plan is sleep until 2 or 3, wake up go somewhere get drunk until 2 or 3, go home sleep, wake up at 11, shower, dress, go to school, I know there's lot's and lot's of coffee somewhere in that little plan as well. anyway, must go I am exhausted, last night I didnt end up going to sleep until like 3 in the morning. i will ask goeff what his name is. not that I will ever see him again. anyway if I do, i will try to be les hyper. I think I did better than usual though, sigh, k night"

"event","Omg I am so fucking angry. gaaaaaaaaaah! I want to scream. I hate everything, god I have to work tomorrow 3-11 which is fine.. that's a normal 8 hour shift, ok then i go to school all week, then saturday i work 7- 3 and sunday I work 8-4, then i go to school all week again. it's fucking rediculous. I'd rather work like 2 4 hous shifts and one day on the weekend. i refuse to live my life either at school learning, in my room studying or at Tim Hortons pretending I care about Bill's fucking policies or some customers complaints. I wouldnt care as much if it were at least a respectable job. on the weekdays i work i have to be there at 3:30... that gives me 20 minutes to get out of my class to my locker, pack up my books run down to tim's, change into my (stupid mother fucking ugly ass itchy irritating flood pants) uniform and be on the floor. I'm sorry that's not possible. Bill's all like, you can be here by 3:30 right? what time do you get off? <<3:10>> Yeah, ok so 3:30. *walks away* inner me... *FUCKING GOD DAMMED HELL I FUCKING HATE YOU BILL!!!!!!!!!!!* That's not even the best part. The logical thing would be simply quit right? I think I'm justified, scholiosis, constant headaches, chemistry, biology, and I have to work my way up to academic math. two of which will be first semester, and I cant just pass these classes, I have to do very well if I want a *future* dont even get me started on that one. I mean if you could pick any time in a persons life to determine who the rest of their life will turn out, why the hell would you make it adolescence!!! >_< not the point. SO I come home, take ONE!!! advil, my first ""drug"" in about a week. My mother sighs, ""why are you taking that?""... 'Headahce"" i replied, as if she couldnt have guessed. ""You need to stop taking so many of those"" at which point I just glare at her, ""Why are you always so angry?"" ""I'm not"" ""Your angry right now!"" 
""I'm angry right now, because I have a headache, your hassling me about one advil, I hate my job, I am stressed to the max about school and it hasnt even started yet and I dont even have a weekend to de-stress and above all, the first thing my step father says to me in a few days is ' bethany, you really fucked up your hair' jack ass. then i tell them i want to consider quiting, they ask why, I tell them, they actually laugh. ok i realize they work full time, and murray drives to montreal a few times a week, but in all fareness, that's all he does, that and moe the lawn. then the buts so let's see, 1. BUT.. he has a kid. this is laughable, I've spent more time raising Jordan than he has. 2. he's been working all his life... of course he has... it's called a career! fuck you. he's like two months away from retiring, then he can moe the lawn full time. 3. he had a job when he was in high school. when he was in high school it was the sixties and all he had to do was pump gas for like 2 hours a week. and he loved it. i have to put up with perverted costumers, a retarted uniform, irritating managers, shitty co -workers, CONSTANT PAIN. etc. i hate him, he's supposed to be the replacement dad to keep me sane and chase away boys and get mad at me when I break curfew and i call him daddy and sigh at his old music. all he does is brainwash my mum into thinking thier making a joint decision while he controls everything either from montreal or the front lawn. i dont care that he's our financial provider, I'd rather be broke and have a dad who gives a shit about me and my life. the worst part is I could sit here crying until dawn and no one would notice, it's like I dont even exist, I will walk in to a room and they'll stand around , ignore me for while then leave without saying anything, how can parents be so blind, teenagers arent angry for nothing, be it because they want attention or because it's better than showing the weakness in sadness, the desperation for someone to care and aknowledge them, it's never just to spite them, honestly i'm not sitting in my room giggling because I gave them something to discuss until the commercials end. even this stupid update in itself is a half hearted attempt to have someone aknowledge that it's hard and it hurts. i watn someone who cares about me unconditionally, i suppose mum is the closest that's ever come,  but she scarcly notices I'm alive any more, murray is like just there. my dad is not even worth mentioning, to put ot briefly, he cared more about hetting his baleys in his coffee on the way to school than he did making sure his kids werent killed in a horrible crash on the highway. samantha has spent hours sobbing into my mothers lap about how much she hates me, while I was in the next room, trying desperately to firgure out why, alone, with no one to comfort me, jordan hates me unless I help him do something his parents arent aorund to do. I remeber when he was little and they would yell at him for crying at night and I would wiat until they left then go into his room and comfort him until he fell asleep, but he doesnt care, he only cared that samantha told him I was a horrible person and he believed her because she was cool. mark as much as i love him, is a doormat, he still let's everyone push him around, and I'm sorry but without respect there's no love and you cant respect someone who kisses your ass. Brent abused me whule andrew shot up in the other room, and even still samantha who is too thick to get it, sits there and says things like, ""I miss Brent, he was great eh?"" he used to sit in his room looking at porn and give the finger to anyone who walked in, then when he got bored with that he's leave his room and scream at anyone he saw. theres never been anyone I can trust without swift reprocussions, and people wonder why I freaked out and dumped trever, i trusted him, he got too close, i trusted my dad, he crapped out on me, I trusted my mum and murray and they brought andrew and brent into my home, i was 7 years old. every person i ever trusted regardless of how briefly they've deasteated me, I trusted cliff, my dad's old boss, because he was an adult, a father, a nice guy, he shoved a child into a river and laughed while I struggled and paniced. and still no one notices, my mum is sitting down there on the couch with murray watching saturday night live, laughing, i'm up here reliving every devistating horrible memory I have and she'll never have any idea. I'm going to bed. maybe when I wake up the world wont be such a shit bag. someone let me know if it get's any better."

"event","I'm going insane... it just occured to me that I had no idea what day it was... actually none at all. It's really sad, I spent like 10 minutes trying to problem solve... ok so here's my logic... it must be a week day because my mom was gone when i got up and then like two hours later she was bitching because I didnt clean or something.... so yes weekday... i worked on a tuesday I know that, it was weird because it was only a three hour shift... then I looked at my calendar and it said september... so I figure if it really is september and there is a god... it must be the first... so now it is september 1st. regardless of wheather it really is or not. sigh. my mother is insane... more so than usual. She's for some reason convinced that I am in a foul disposition recently, the only thing is no one has noticed except her... She'll come in and be like, ""bethany! empty the dishwasher!"" and I'll be like ""K whatever..."" and then she'll go off for like 20 minutes about my attitude and how I've been really foul lately. she's crazy. or I'm crazy... one or the other... she also doesnt seem to notice that Jordan is an ass. literally, he has no table manners, he talks with his mouth full, and holds his knife and fork like he's an axe murderer...er.... and he watched t.v 24/7. he actualy cired for about 10 minutes when we said he couldnt watch t.v. while eating dinner. not that it matters because he'll be down stairs watching t.v. until around 10:30-11 which will bw when one of us ventures down stairs and is caught half way there by mum telling us to go get jordan up to bed. usually because she's watching something on home and garden telivision. I hate T.V. it's dumb... not that the computer is much better, but atleast I'm thinking, typing... etc. actually my entire family disgusts me... samantha... currently weighing in at aprox. 200 pounds, 14 years old, (btw the weight is accurate)is on her maybe 8th meal of the day at dinner I put some margerine on my brocolli and she actually looks up at me and says ""Bethany! that's not good!"" AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1. It's MARGERINE!!!!!!!!!
2. Your overweight, not me!
3. I HATE YOU ALL!!!!
4. she had already consumed countless granola bars, not the god ones... the chocolate ones... lots of chocolate rice crispy bars, nutella sandwiches... (2) on white bread, corn pops and probably alor more too. bah
time for sleeping, much too tired. I cant believe school starts in a week.. depressing. ok must go now, see people later."

... right. anyway, i am tired, bored and can not sleep, so naturally I am updating. the only problem is there is nothing new to update about... so I will ramble as though someone were reading and finding it amusing... or at least worth listening too. it wont be, by the way, interesting that is... just so no body get's their hopes up.... so yes, school in far too few days. Omg I cant find my necklace, I havent worn it in a few days now and all my muscles are out of wack, like every few hours the muscle in my foot, like the one that runs along the inner arch... thingie... spasms then completely locks, which is far, far more painful than it sounds... seriously. same with my knee and shoulder, so I have been moping around, wolloing in self pity and pain... bah must go now for the sleeping... .... yeah.... k bye ^_-"

"event","I feel good. For the first time in a few days I feel relatively happy. Not for any reason, it's my mum's birthday, so I have coke. and it's marks birthday party tomorrow, maybe their happiness is making me happy ^_^ anyway, ok so here's my crisis, I have to drop fitness, which I have second period first semester, so I need anyone who is taking a good class second period to tell me so I can have something to replace it with. I am taking like two sciences, world history, which I assume either is actually ancient civ in a clever yet totally unnecessary guise or they screwed up my classes. Both are entirely possible given the current state of our education system. Anyway, world history, science (chemisrty), english for first semester, then I have peer teaching? it's in the second I think, but they put it in the first on my time table...uh... then photography, not sure why, math and my ohter science.... bio yeah. that sounds right, I'm so happy, I have no teachers I hate... that I know of...oh yeah, is Alexander, J like Mrs Alexander... the vice principal? or is there a teacher Alexander? I dont want school to start again... >_< '

OK so yes erm... yes so tomorrow tasha if you want we can go to bayshore for the paycheck depositing then dye hairs (Yours too?) then yes... i havent thought that far yet."

So that was fun, in hind sight those were good sluchie's though. Gah I am broke until forever, I dont know if I still owe my mum $100 i owe my brother $20 something at least, so there's my entire next paycheck. I'm just glad I dont have to work until Sunday... ^_^ This summer kinda sucked... it was still vastly better than last summer but not all that great, I didnt really do anything except work and I have nothing to show for that anyway. bah. consequentially I have nothing further to write about.

I spent the night at my aunts house though, she's like my therapist, whcih was great until she told me I must be going insane and she cant imagine the shit that goes on in my head... not so comforting, I am well on my way to raging alcaholism. yay, now me and sam are going to wax the ""treasure trail"" not that you needed to know any of that. hehe... ok well that hurt, and didnt work. Gah, Ia m so happy i dont have to work tomorrow, we spent the majority of today changing around Katie's room, and now i am in pain, I just cant feel it because of the drugs... ^_^ hehe omg I am pathetic, so far according to everyone I've talked to, which is like doctors, parents, aunts... who is also a doctor O_o... and yes other people I have scholiosis, arthritis, fatigue, a cold... shut up... stress and tension headaches and ""issues"" with my father. and I should sleep, not drink >_< not lift things, take drugs but non habit forming ones,drink orange juice and take irno pills, oh yeah my iron is low to, hence the dizziness... apparently  so tired, i need more sleep. samantha has kidnapped my guitar Paul is apparently teaching her how to play something, omg I have a new favourite restaurant, the green door, it's like a vegan vegetarian restaurant omfg soooooo good, you just like make your self a big plate and then they weigh it and charge you, usually under $10 a plate but omg sooooo goooooood. my mouth is watering. WE must go, me and other people for the eating and goodness. It's also right beside a store called the three tree's they sell like... i dont know how to describe it, like the stuff at arbour but more cultural. Like insence and natural clothes and jewlelry and bedding, they have some realy nice stuff. and thus I must go back when I have money again, which will not be for a while. Actually this friday. yay, I love payday. my paycheck's going to be miniscule at best though. k ii no longer care to type I am exhausted. Sam is all omg I am fat... sigh, she's dumb, I have to go save her from herself, then... sleep. k later... thanks everyone who gave me a hug...

I think I am going to bayshore soon to buy things, maybe not, meh, i no longer care, i am in an extreme state of not caring about anything. Except that fact that Steve is supposidly coming over tomorrow to set up my internet which is good beyond all things. And Paster Paul is going to sigh my community service sheet for the thirty hour famine so i am unnofically done my hours. I have like 20 just from random volunteering last year, i just never bothered to get them signed off. anyway, anyone who needs hours I highly reccomend the thirty hour famine, if you have the composure to not eat for 30 hours, the up side being of course that you get 30 hours of community service. and anyone who says it doesnt count can count your ribs and kiss my ass. Sorry, little bit bitter, but if Chelsea can get away with her stupid brownie thing than there's no way anyone can cheat me out of my 30 hours. She sucks, omg, she ""volunteer"" at a brownie unit and counts is as hours, that's liek 2 a week plus outings and camping and things, but it shouldnt count because # she isnt volunteering she's enrolled in the program, she just acts superior, and #2 she's not a leader, to be a junior leader you have to finish brownies then guides then pathfinder and get your canada chord then and only then can you choose to be cadet, ranger or junior leader. She did none of this, she just decided never to leave Brownies. how pathetic is that. gah. it angers me. by her standards I have like 9 years of community service. >_<!!!!!!!!!!! gah. must go now... i choose not to disclose the particular reason.

"event","pluh i am so tired, for a change. i have to work sooo much, I work tomorrow 2-9 then not friday then 9-5 on saturday, then 7 (AM!!!!!!!>_<) on sunday... then some more I'm assuming. I blew so much money, I got payed like $350, and now I have $140. ^_^, I brought so much random stuff, books and c.d's and happy bunny brand notebook/c.d tower/purse/playing cards/wallet... yeah I think that's it. hehe. and now I'm broke, kind of. Omg my mum payed like $600 to have the computer de-bugged and now it's worse than ever, so she's like uber pissed. really really alot. It's because Sam's been on msn and using the stupid web-cam. so now we get a million pop-ups and the vast majority of them are several women in somewhat compromising positions, usually licking each other.... eeeeew. anyway, so mum's master plan is to sell the computer and buy herself one just for her work... and I dont really care for a number of reasons. 1. Come next friday I will have the internet. 2. Mark has his own computer at Dad's so he can just use that, if he ever get's the balls to ask dad to have it here, not that he should have to considering he payed for it. 3. it will piss off sam... and there is no way in hell I'm letting her fuck up my computer. teehee. So now assuming I get payed $250 next week, which is reasonable, I will then have $390. so that's $90 for Becca= $300, then $55 for Tasha = $245 then aprox $150 for internet = $95 for savings! w00t! success. I can budget. .......... *Tasha, when I pay you back remind me to bring your little bag-o-stuff* ^_^ Erin is coming down next sunday with cameron, I cant wait to see him, we are going to a baby shower for him giggle. I think I'll have to ask for the day off, Granny is apparently coming down this weekend too so I cant really ask for both off. meh, she probably wont come for a few dys after she says she's coming anyway. Must go eat now. bye"

Marks at work, sam's having her stupid little church friend sleep over, Sharon and steve are over, which was fun until they offered me pina colatas (Sp? too lazy to even try) fonetically ok! Jennifer Guido got a job at Tims... apparently only because Jon, Bill's son said she was hot, so Bill hired her. so that's pretty funny. makes me feel better anyway. I Worked with Serge today ^_^ he is very very cute. he has nice eyes and a nice smile... and he looks pretty much the same in uniform as in street clothes. It occured to me today, as I was on my break that I'm terrifyingly ugly at 9 am while working at Tims... which seriously damages my chances of Serge noticing that I'm female. But that's ok... I have a plan, tomorrow we work the same shift... except he's baking, so if i can pull down my hair, flatten it, untuck my shirt and wipe the mascara from unber my eyes somewhere between leaving store front and getting to the back then he might figure it out... ^_^ I'm sooo tired, i slept through my alarm again and tomorrow i have to be up at like 5 so i can eat, dress, shower and be out the door by 6:30. not necessarily in that order though. I have not enough energy to know how I feel... STUPID TASHA AND TRIPOD LAUGHING AT ME IN DRIV THROUGH! bastards... sigh. this is really good fish... that's one happy thing... ^ in reference to the above ^ dont's i look terrible in that stupid uniform! my god, it's not even like you could alter it to make yourself look decent without Bill firing you on the spot. bastard. sigh... anyway must go sleep now... later"

Anyway, the point is this: Question If I block someone from sending me emails... will they get a notice either right away or if they try to sent me an email? pleeze, kindof important, I dont really care if he finds out, I just dont want him calling me to ask me why I blocked him... it's easier to pretend I'm in the shower or not reply. Yup. aaaaaah the throbbing headness. stupid Tim's called and Moe's like ""I know you worked 16 hours on the weekend, but can you come work another 6 hours tonight..."" ... *click* so w00t! no working for me tonight ^_^ freedom Horrible horrible freedom.

I'm sure when I talk to them again it will be all happy and fine, as though it never came up, that's pretty much the norm for my family, if you dont talk about it you never have to admit it happened. wow I am depressing myself more... sigh, I will go find some classical... cello song If I'm lucky, not that I have money, or anyhting to download with... if anyone know's of a good website to download free music dont be stingy and share with the class. ^_^"

So yes Moe... who is perpetually happy, and Tasha who is pregnant but nice enough, Marc who works the drive through and bumps into people every few minutes, me and sarah, Nick's girlfriend, still trying to figure that one out. Oh god the horror, yesterday after work, nick waited for an hour for me to finish my shift then walked me home... i actually could not get him to leave me alone, then he was telling me k never mind, i cant describe it so i will quote. ""yes, so I actually had to watch my last girl friend DIE BEFORE ME EYES... yeah neither of us were very well like, and one stormy night we were ambushed by 15 people, we took most of them down, but one of the grabbed her hair and threw her back into the goal poast and broke her back in  3 places. So i went crazy and beat the remaining people to shit, then carried her home, then she died the next morning in the hospital beside me, so i tracked down every one of those 15 people and made their lives a living hell for about 2 months, I stalked them... alot"" no shit, he actually said all of this in complete seriousness, then he started telling me about how Sarah is epileptic and how she had a siezure (?) on his lap once and (hehe... not that its funny) once her sister had one that lasted 2 hours and all her fiance could do was sit by her side and ""weep"" *snort* yes, oh god... it just occured to me... I am going to end up like chelsea... all i'll ever talk about is work... aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. k too tired for that much emotion. so yes... oh yeah.

"event","aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... *twitch*...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah i'm soooooooooooo bored I am going to die. omg i havent let my house since my stupid job orientation. I now have an incredible respect for absolutely every working person who has to wear a uniform. I can tell you first hand it sucks ass. alot and alot of ass. more ass then ever before concievable and then some more just for good measure. grumble. 
oksoyes, I've decided to write the great canadian novel      intitled: 
          ""God I fucking hate Tim Hortons"" 
               By: Beth/bethany (just not late for dinner) Mao... sorry moau.... moss? ooooooh Mausz... how do you spell that. (there is a reason why these people both upwards of 45 still work at Tim hortons)   

Chapter one. Its tacky and itchy and it smells like coffee and sweat. The uniform. 
  Ugly pants that some how manage to come up to above my bellybutton but still are far too short. They barely reach my ancles when I'm standing. Not just me either, everyone's are like that. The shirt, it buttons up... all the way up, and must be tucked in. The viser DOES NOT FIT NOR LOOK GOOD ON ANYBODY! I DEFY YOU ALL TO FIND SOMEONE WHO LOOKS GOOD IN A TIM HORTONS VISOR!!!! The hair-net... there is a hair net, enough said. and the betl... far too short, for some reason actual leather and half covered in a clear sticky substance that will not come off. 

Chapter two. Nick.
 Nick works there. I'm working with him today... for 5 hours. 

Chapter three. You can call me anything just not late for dinner. 
  This exact phrase has been said to me by Bill (so far) 7 (yes really) 7 times! actually 7... I'm not even exagerating. he also said that jokes or vulgar comments of any kind will not be permitted. Then proceeded to tell Ruby that she was hot. not in so many words but it came out of his mouth. 

Chapter four. The videos. 
  For the duration of BOTH! yes both (w00t)*<- sarcasm* of my fifteen minute breaks for the next 5 hours of working at Timmy Ho's I am expected to spend my time in a tiny smell office with another person watchin very outdated dvd's on a very old computer about everything you never wanted to know about tim hortons. actually everything... from tim horton him self to what to do if there is a robbery to why you shouldnt mix the new lettuce with the old. There are about 25 dvd's in total. all about 30 minutes long. There are also questions you have to answer... I've discovered that regardless of what the video says the answer will be the one after the answer you think is right. even if it's wrong. just because there is no god in that place. 

Ok so that was the first couple chapters of my book. Hope you enjoyed... all i can sat now is DO NOT order the milk... chocolate or other, I can guarantee it's been there a while and even the ""new"" one's get shoved to the back and will not see the light of day for a few weeks."

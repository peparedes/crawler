the ocean breaks the frame
and we go down together to a watery grave
oh yes my dear id love to spend forever (with you)

the waves push us deeper and deeper into unmarked origins
and the salt drys our throats just before they burst
oh yes my dear, id love to spend forever (with you)

our voices weaken as our lungs are filled with sand and water
and we'll cross the border of this world in a silent solitude 
oh yes my dear id love to spend forever (with you)

we approach the sand and dig ourselves in
and hold eachother close for just a few seconds more
oh yes my dear, id love to spend forever (with you)

its almost over and darkness sets in
ill only be gone a short while till we're awaken again
oh yes my dear, id die to spend forever (with you)

"event","Dearest Jersey, if you are reading this now it is because i am dead...i know it's a blunt way to put it, but i am in fact, deceased.  and the irony of it i died in your arms under your eyes, with my face next to your heart.  did you see me?  or was the preoccupation around so distracting even when holding in your hands my life.  you kept me warm on the nights it was cold but id still go out anyway to have a smoke and slide into dep thought about you, my troubles, and the blistering snowflakes scratching at my face like glass.  dont worry though, i didnt feel any pain, and your warm streets are now clean of my mess.  i wont clutter you up anymore, you always said i did if you can remember.  i cry when i think of our times.  we were always the life of the party, and everyone loved and envied us, we could have lasted forever, had it not been for a stray bullet getting in my way that is.  i miss you more than i miss life.  you made my life.  you kissed me gently when i was dripping wet soaked in apathy and beer, you gave me a place to sleep at.  you always were there when i woke up, and i saw love.  you were in front of me the whole time.  i love you seventy times seven and nothing can tear us apart, it couldnt in life.  and it wont in death, i'll be waiting for you with high hopes and a heart bigger than before.  I love you jersey marie lane, dont forget about me.
...Sincerely yours forever with love..."

"event","There's something about Jersey that makes me feel like james dean. when i settle into her arms i am a legend, loved by many, hated by more, but im what everyone else wants to be. there's something about sitting outside of the bars after hours basking in the serenades of cars passing, distant voices, and a trail of music from inside the apartments above. id already come to the conclusion that i would be sleeping under the roof of one of these apartments. somewhere in the night walked my beauty queen, the girl all girls loved to hate but would die to be. just because she was with me, james dean. i drove the streets without any set plan other than ""to love and to be loved"". i hate driving buried under the influence because the street lights burn into your retinas blinding you for a good 3 seconds every pass, and you concentrate so hard to make sure of little things such as, your speed, your surroundings and cops. i reached the corner of 413 pasington st. where the only building that seemed to still have life in it was. and i found her. she pretended to care as i always do, and gave me my bed for the night, as well as her heart...for the night. which i took and ran with only hours later. innocent? possibly she was, but then again, in my state of mind, even last nights girl was innocent. so much for the dreams of the country girl i would love to death, and share with, the loss of innocence . im an insomniac i thought to myself while smoking under the street lights. the smoke floated into portraits of love that i could never paint. ""jersey you hold me back"" i whispered, ""and i love you for that and ill see you again soon""."

"event","the smell of being back in town made me long for the congestion of jersey.  for some reson i like the dirty, cramped up streets that i so often find myself stumbling through drenched under the influence.  i hate the hangover that crushes my head when im trying to indulge in the sweet essence of the morning after before it seeps into regret.  there's a part of me that loves the feelings of being used, and hated, and dirty, but there is a part of me that hates my other half for loving all of the above.  ""to love and to be loved""...what i should be longing for, and what i am longing for, but somehow i think i wont reach it, which spells out my behaviors of careless drinking, one night stands, and half-hearted care.  there's just something about the cold wind cutting my face like glass when im walking through the streets with a girl, more inebriated than i, hand in hand and not feeling cold at all.  i try to push out the thought that, this isnt real, the warmth is probably just the vodka i had consumed considerable amounts of only to pretend i knew what i was talking about when we spoke of love.  ""i'll come back to you soon""... a promise to be broken, as i do hearts...and as i do my own.  do you miss me jersey?  because i miss you too."

"event","this past weekend i went to jersey.  i passed time in the streets during the day shopping aimlessly in stores i couldnt afford anything but water in, and at night drank myself into alcohol-induced comas.  the nights seem to drift by, and every other night i was taken home by a new girl.  one that wouldnt care after she had left for work the morning and left me in her bed, nor be able to account of who i was when she returned.  yes, i continued this nightly until my feelings were...til i had no feelings, no account of what i was doing, saying, or wishing.  until all the world around me was simply a blur yet moved in slow motion.  until i was completely numb.  i think more people were ashamed of me more than i was of myself, but then again, i was too numb to care anyway.  i ate only to get by, and spent my last night in town staring at the ceiling of a new apartment next to a girl, that well, i couldnt even recall her name...  Jersey, where i want to be, this is where i want to be.  i left without an accomplishment to a goal that i never had.  ""to love, and to be loved""...hmm, i'll keep that in mind."

Andrew Largeman: What? 
Sam: My mom always says that, when she can see i'm like working something out in my head, she's like, 'you're in it right now' and I'm looking at you're telling this story, and you're definitely in it. 

Titembay: Someone has been pissing on my Gamecube and I'm about to close the case. 

Andrew Largeman: We're not playing Spin the Bottle; how old are we? More importantly, how old are they? 
Jesse: Oh, they're all legal. I think...

Tim: [to Mark's mom, Carol] I had a lovely evening. 
[to Andrew] 
Tim: By the way, it says ""BALLS"" on your face.

Dr. Cohen: You know, our bodies are capable of incredible things when they're subjected to anxiety and stress. I found my ex-best friend's cufflinks in my wife's purse one time. I couldn't get an erection for a year and a half... for example...

Andrew Largeman: We may not always be as happy as you always dreamed we'd be, but for once, let's just allow ourselves to be whatever it is we are.

Andrew Largeman: I think we've corrupted this innocent girl enough for one day! 
Sam: I'm not innocent. 
Andrew Largeman: Yes, you are! That's what I like about you, okay? And I don't want this guy taking you to some sketchy quarry in the middle of Newark to find crack whores huffing turpentine or pit bulls raping each other or whatever else is down here! 

Sam: OK, so... so... sometimes I lie. I mean, I'm weird, man. About random stuff too, I don't even know why I do it. It's like... it's like a tick, I mean sometimes I hear myself say something and think, ""Wow, that wasn't even remotely true."" 

Sam: We're not gonna make out or anything, okay? 
Andrew Largeman: What? 
Sam: Oh, I'm sorry. I just totally ruined that moment, didn't I?

Andrew Largeman: But Kenny, the last time I saw you, you were doing coke lines off a urinal. 
Kenny: I know, I know, man... but it was time for me to grow up, you know? Plus, I wasn't making shit at that fish market. No one knew who I was, I couldn't get laid. Yeah, it's a much better situation for me now. 

Andrew Largeman: You know, this necklace makes me think of this totally random memory of my mother. I was a little kid, and I was crying for whatever reason. And she was cradling me, rocking me back and forth, and I can just remember the silver balls rolling around. And there was snot dripping all over my face. She offered me her sleeve and told me to blow my nose. I can can remember, even as a little kid, thinking to myself, ""This is love... this is love."" 

Andrew Largeman: I don't want to waste another moment of my life without you in it. 

Sam: He's defending me. He's my knight in shining armor. 
Andrew Largeman: Don't mention knights around Mark, it's a sore subject. 
Mark: I'm going to kill that motherf-er. 
Andrew Largeman: Pun intended?

Sam: This is your one opportunity to do something that no one has ever done before and that no one will copy throughout human existence. And if nothing else, you will be remembered as the one guy who ever did this. This one thing. 

Diego: Who just saw some titties? 
[Mark, Largeman and Sam raise their hands tentatively] 
Diego: Ok. Now everybody calm the f-k down! 

Andrew Largeman: You remember that idea I had about working stuff out on my own and then finding you once I figured stuff out? 
Sam: The ellipsis? 
Andrew Largeman: Yes, the ellipsis. It's dumb. It's dumb. It's an awful idea. I'm not gonna do it, okay? 'Cause like you said, this is it. This is life. And I'm in love with you, Samantha. I think that's the only thing I've ever been really sure of in my entire life. 

THESE ARE JUST A FEW LINES FROM ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES, ""GARDEN STATE"" GO SEE IT...IM PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE IT AND ME FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE..."

MO' BUTTER MEANS EXTRA TOAST...wow that is a quote by jay-z on a screwed and chopped cd i found in my college parking lot, in perfect condition it seriously says that, and im suppose to take it seriously?  i am no rapper...

1) today was the 3rd time ive pooped at work...
2) i am a stalker of jesse lacey and yes rumor is true i took in a magazine with brand new in it, showed the hair cut lady a picture of jesse lacey and said, ""do that""...
3) i am going to give blood this week, and am scared...
4) i am my own worst critic and disapprove just about everything i do...
5) i have a committment problem...
6) i have a fear of getting fat, and i dont eat sometimes...
7) i buy too many cds, i am an addict...
8) i am obsessive compulsive and i usually dont sleep enough...
9) i usual hate the way i look...
10) i am afraid of being alone and dying alone...
11) today was the first day i played a lottery scratch off...i lost

AND NOW TO MY FAVORITE HOOKER...""oh oh sweet darling girl, im so glad, you found me""- BK  
(okay so she's not a hooker per say...lol, jk she's not a hooker at all, just a lovely lovely girl)

THEY CARDED ME, AND THEY CARTED ME OFF...2 more days till northstar, say anything and straylight run...meaning 2 more days until i marry michelle nolan, and hug max bemis and not let go simply because of the fact he's a musical genius!  thanks for reading everyone see you new years!  or when i see you!"

ALL THAT HE WANTS IS JUST A TRADGEDY...so here's my deal, i was playing with some guys, not really a whole band yet, not playing shows or anything just sorta playing around seeing if we could possibly start something band-wise, and then i found out that well, he's in another band now, and had been for like 2 weeks or 3 or something like that...so basically i guess the band i was trying to start is done, but really it's not that bad, because, okay so we were playing hardcore and all, just instrumental, we hadnt really found vocals and normally i would do that but i dont scream as well as say keith of etid, lol, but as time pursued we were kinda getting stuck getting nowhere, and i think that's when he went to the other band, and we were all just busy with our individual lives, but anyway, back to my thoughts, i as i kept playing, i would leave get in my car and listen to say brand new, tbs, alk3, or e11, and it's like, that's what i want to do, i want to play that kinda music, i want to be singing, and playing guitar in that style of band, ive proved to myself, that i can play hardcore better than several people around here, and now i want to make myself happy and play the music i want to play, which is more than likely brand new, alk3, and early november style stuff.  it's what makes me happy but dont get me wrong, i love hardcore to death, i just dont think it's what i want to play, so anyway, im back at square one, but im gonna be picky with this next band i think, cause i meet people and im like, wow i could definitely get along with and play with guys like them, and they are just such cool guys, (for example this side up), my ideal idea of guys i want to play with...anyway, im done, that's been my last few weeks of excitement, i love music, i love playing music, i need to play music, i hate the real world, i hate halloween, and i hate test, and i love women, that's all...

I HOPE THAT ALL IS WELL IN HEAVEN, CAUSE IT'S ALL BEEN SHOT TO HELL DOWN HERE...well this week has started off on a good foot, see for starters, in english, he gave us a test, but we werent suppose to take it till wednesday, but the deal is he isnt even gonna be able to make it wednesday do to a family sickness i think is what he said, so he said to have it as a take home test and have it done by monday, and that we can use w/e we want to answer it, even a friend to compare notes and answers....i will be passing this class no doubt, now...also, in history class i took decent notes, talked to ashley about our weekends, and that's about it no assignments other than to start getting ready to start ready this book...and tomorrow i have psychology and A&P classes, but theyre just taking notes and all, i got a A&P test thursday but it shouldnt be too bad i know most of the stuff...so im having a good first day of the week...

I HEAR THE RAIN IT FALLS SO VIOLENTLY...it's rained all day...that sucks, it does, it's true, other tahn that, the day has been good i didnt realize how good tylenol daytime makes you feel, i do love uppers, maybe that's why this day has been good, i think im gonna stop taking downers and stick with uppers, just not at the same time, that's bad stuff for you if youre taking downers then uppers and downers again, so just uppers for me from now on lol...gosh i feel good...

I NEED YOU LIKE THE DRAGONFLIES WINGS NEED THE WIND...such a great simile, and oh so true for how i feel about a particular girl...wait, brb, switchfoots new video is on...anyway, back to what i was saying...i need you here like you've always been...take me for granted!  gosh i love copeland it sucks i dont get to hang out with them this weekend due to work, grr baby love and amanda will say hey for me of course...

ALL OF THE WORLD AND ALL OF IT'S POWERS, COULDNT KEEP YOUR LOVE FROM ME...omg, i had a chipolte (sp?) burrito and my life was complete!  thanks!  okay maybe not complete but for a moment i felt complete it was oh so good tho i still choose freebirds above all, it was still fantastic, i sorry beth, i do agree with daniel still, i love my freebirds...thanks for driving me there!  sing me something soft, sad and delicate, or loud and out of key, sing me anything...

SO IF THIS IS WHAT IT TAKES, JUST TO LIE WITH MISTAKES, REMEMBER WHAT I DID TO YOU, ALL THE HELL I PUT YOU THROUGH, I ALWAYS CATCH THE CLOCK IT'S 11:11 AND YOU WANT TO TALK, IT'S NOT HARD TO DREAM, YOU'LL ALWAYS BE MY KONSTANTINE, MY KONSTANTINE, THEY'LL NEVER HURT YOU LIE I DO...this is to a girl who got into my head with all these pretty things she did, hey, you know they keep me up in bed, this is to a girl who got into my head with all these f-ed up things i did, hey maybe, baby, you can keep me up in bed, my konstantine...did you know i missed you...

Your grand dad left home for the circus. He was young just like me, with hope to explore. He married a girl in Virginia. She could swing the trapeze; they could sleep on the floor. 

Your mother was born in December, on the one sunny day that winter gave up. She had warm summer eyes that flickered like fireflies, when she stared at the world. 

So why do you leave these stories unfinished, my Cheshire cat doorstop with tears in her eyes? Why do you look when you've already found it? What did you find that could leave you walking by? 

She was raised in a New England village. Then she moved to LA with her firefly stare, and you loved sunset strip when it sparkled, you grew up and you sparkled but why don't you care? 

So why do you leave these stories unfinished, my Cheshire cat doorstop with tears in her eyes? Why do you look when you've already found me? What did you find that could leave you walking by? 

These nights I get high just from breathing. When I lie here with you I'm sure that I'm real, like that firework over the freeway. I could stay here all day but that's not how you feel. 

So why do you leave these questions unanswered? The circus awaits and you're already gone. My Cheshire cat doorstop with fear in your smile, what makes it so easy for you to be walking by? And what did I do that you can't seem to want me? Why do we lie here and whisper goodbyes? Where can I go that your pictures won't haunt me? What makes it so easy for you to be walking by?

WELL THE TRUTH IS THAT I MISS YOU...okay so i've determined 2 things, when i listen to alk3 i get depressed because of their dark, heart-breaking lyrics, but like it...when i listen to coldplay i get depressed because it's mellow, beautiful, yet still sad, but i like it...when i listen to bright eyes i get depressed because it's just so sad, but i like it...when i listen to get-up kids, i get depressed, because it makes me think of times with bethany...but, contrary to getting depressed, i love those bands to death...thanks thats all i wanted to say about that, so listen to all those bands everyone...

I WANTED YOU FOR NOTHING MORE THAN HATING YOU FOR WHAT YOU WERE...why have i had so many relationships throughout my 19 1/4 months, that fit that quote?  haha i also would like to ask myself, why, as much as i deny, do i have to be so damned emo...

"event","""another night i should have just stayed home alone sulking in the fact that i am alone, there is no one here for me, there never will be, and yes...that is the end"".  

CHAPTER 1
MAYBE IT'S THE WAY I ENVY HIS HAIR... 
ive never felt so numb, maybe it was the alcohol coming in adequate amounts flowing uncontrollable like the nile through the house, or maybe i just wasnt suppose to be here.  everyone was having a good time, some not so good leaning against trees while spilling their guts...literally onto the ground from too much ""fun"".  another drink made me forget the fact that i hated him, or her, and didnt care about the fact that he was a dick to me, and she was another slut that would be with a new guy tonight, not me though...every guy but me.  that's how it always was though.  i lit a ciggarette and tried to focus but reality was only a thread on the verge of breaking if i downed another bottle.  ""hey a$$hole, dont smoke in here..."".  i put it out on the carpet, and simply closed my eyes, blind to the thought that i was actually being such an a$$hole.  also to drown out the threats and insults that pursued my action. 

CHAPTER 2
SPITTING GAME THROUGH BROKEN SENTENCES AND SHORT-TERM MEMORY
""i should just leave"" i kept telling myself, i loathed so many people here, as well as myself, and then remembered i was too inebriated to drive. ""damn"". so i sat down and simply opened another drink to self-medicate.  ""i really should be alone, at home, laying in my bed watching my life slowly drift by above me"" i told her.  oh yeah, her, she caught my eye, i dont know her, and probably wont remember her name by the end of tonight even if we did sneak away at some point.  funny how when youre so far gone, everything is glazed over, you dont care the fact that youve been trying to smoke an unlit ciggarette for the past hour, and that only one thing focuses now and then while everything else drifts into careless oblivion.  well that was her, my one focus, my outlet, the only thing that made me think, this party may have a heart somewhere in the emptiness i found it to be.  ""where have you been all my life""...""dammit"" too late to take that back i told myself, but she just laughed realizing the extent of my intoxication.  the lack of feeling i felt at the moment in my arms, legs, and face were about equal to that of myself for her.  ""i just want to be alone, in my room, thinking about how i lost my last relationship"" i thought to myself.  talking to myself, the only action i could perform somewhat sober.  as much as i loved it, i hated being this way.  i could say whatever i wanted and blame it on the alcohol.  ""hey, you, yeah, youre a skank, but i love you""  i could slur out and it would be laughed off.  i loved the way i could just use ""love"" without a care and everyone would reply back with the same.  ""you too"" knowing i wouldnt remember.  and thus my problem. 

CHAPTER 3
IF THERE WAS A WAY TO REGAIN MY COMPOSURE I'D LIKE TO KNOW
unable to walk, i crawled to the bedroom, and laid on the bed, hoping to stop the spinning, and make up for the hours of sleep i was losing.  and there she was, my focus, my outlet, had followed me as if i had told her.  had i told her to come in here?  sh*t, i dont remember much, even 5 minutes ago.  she could walk, clearly, only shakey, but she knew what she was doing, and ""love"", i loved the way i could just throw it out at her and pull her in.  not that i had to.  she smiled a guilty smile that only told me she just wished i could remember this by the morning and would call her the next day.  ""dont count on it, sweetheart, i wont remember this in 10 min."" i told myself.  ""dont hold this against me if i forget"".  i swiftly said, ""what's that you'd forget?"" she shot back somewhat concerned i DID know what was going on.  ""i..."" i passed out.

CHAPTER 4
WE'RE GONNA DIE LIKE THIS YOU KNOW...
""this isnt my room, these arent my sheets, this is not my bed"" i screamed at myself, silently and turned over, there she was, the slut, that would be with anyone willing, or unwilling.  ""whoa whoa whoa"" please tell me we didnt"" i shouted at her.  a smirk, of satisfaction slapped me in the face.  ""omg, no no no, i should have just stayed home, this is why i dont do this""  now i was a part of her, no matter how much i wanted to hate her, and though she didnt care, she had a part of me, she'd take and run carelessly with off into the world.  ""and im alone again, drenched in sweat, alcohol, and apathy"".  i smiled through a hangover, at reality that sings the incessant melody ""i am alone, there is no one here for me, never will be, and yes...that is the end...until friday comes again and i kiss a bottle to blur the lines between love and hate."""

THE STILL FRAME IN THE LENS...the city lights burned brightest at 6 am just before day break, before the orange glow of sunrise found its way over the horizon to outshine them.  the streets were wet from the nights rain and from a distance looked as if they had been painted.  everything seemed beautiful from a distance, you saw the whole picture and everything was perfect.  there was no violence or death in a painted world.  the canvas held together one moment that would symbolize an eternity of perfection.  

CHAPTER 2
ON THE BRINK OF A THOUGHT
he lifted his camera to steal a shot of her not paying attention.  perfect.  she sipped again at her latte as she looked out the window of their condo.  the sun was peaking its way over the buildings and finding it's way to the still half awake world.  he picked up the paper, the back page had been torn off.  ""honey, where's the back of the paper?""  ""what are you talking about?"" she replied.  ""it's gone, someone tore it out""  it was obvious she didnt know, it was present in her voice.  he knew that much from 10 years of marriage, it never seemed that long, and there wasnt a single wrinkle on her face to prove it'd been that long.  she was perfect.  he lifted the lens to savor another moment that would only mean anything to him.  the sun seemed to be taking it's time, still only barely peeking itself over the horizon now.  the cars were slowly lining the streets, as were the people, who from their balcony appeared as ants.  It didnt matter if they were smiling, or if they were angry, or depressed, from the balcony, their faces were a blur an assumption that everything was fine made up for emotion, and that was all he needed.  to think that everything would always be fine in this world.

CHAPTER 3
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HERE AND THERE HE LOST IT
she left.  he began on his work.  a writer, a poet, an artist.  he couldnt ever decide on what he liked better to be called.  in his own world he painted, he was all of the above.  though artist stood most to get his attention.  his hair fell just the way he liked it in his eyes, and it never failed to please him.  as did she.  she was made out of perfection.  the pictures he'd take of her were to always remember how perfect he saw her.  as an artist would see his art.  priceless.  the windows were a little wet from the rain that he heard the night before.  the streets as he saw them were darker than usual.  as if painted by the smoke and rain.  the shade seemed inspirational.  skimming over the beauty of the city, something caught his eye.  a window. slightly crooked.  no, no, no, several windows, on the building, crooked.  perfection had a flaw.  and destroyed the thought he had of a perfect world.  he cried out and beat against his window as if something like this was inevitable to happen.  as if he saw it coming.  as if what he saw could never be to his desire.  losing it, losing it.  in pure frustration he punched the wall and broke skin.  only no blood.  again and again and again he punched the wall with blood as desire but didnt lose a drop.  all this from a crooked window.  ""this can never be fixed, i am a failure"" he screamed at himself.  he walked to the window, and jumped.

CHAPTER 4
PERFECTION FROM THE WINDOW
the sun still hadnt found it's way over the horizon, the time was still 6 am.  the world was still half awake and everything seemed normal, if not perfect.  except for the window.  the crooked windows that drove him mad.  the window that would always hold a small imperfection to what he strived for...perfection.  he landed on the sidewalk.  next to a torn piece of newspaper covered with obituaries.  everything was perfect from up above.  as it always will be.  emotion is what you make it.  another flaw of perfection laid on the sidewalk.

CHAPTER 5
THE PERFECT WORLD OF IMPERFECTION
he awoke to the glow of the sun coming over the horizon.  and looked down at his painting of the city.  the buildings.  the damp streets dark from the late night rain.  the crooked window of imperfection.  the perfect people walking the streets.  the one flaw next to a newspaper on the sidewalk.  he smiled and labeled his work, ""the perfect world of imperfection""."

I'll hide you in my walls, your body will never be found

with your eyes gouged out by the work of my thumbs
the scent of your insides from under the floorboards
the perfect perfume to settle a score.

"event","I. WHEN THE SUN CAME UP, THEY WERE BOTH IN BED...the blinds werent enough to block the bright sun creeping through the window.  sprawled acrossed elegantly disheveled sheets they breathed quietly.  he slighty woke, only to roll over and whisper softly in her ear, ""im so glad, you found me..."" just like their song said, the song that made them only fall more in love after every playback.  he loved to be romantic, and her lavish smile always showed she loved it.  ""...your power surrounds me"" he continued as she slowly woke up to the serenades of his voice and the warmth of his breath against her neck.  the clock spelt out 8:01 am, the calendar whispered November 18, 2004.  and time stood still.

II. I LOVE YOU'S NOT ENOUGH IM LOST FOR WORDS...the blinds werent enough to silence the rain that pounded against the frame of the window.  warm under blankets they breathed quietly.  she loved watching him sleep and then would whisper, ""if youre dreaming are you dreaming of me...""  he loved to dream about her.  she loved when he'd sing to her.  just the sound of his breathing made her heart skip a beat now and then.  she kissed his cheek as she glanced over at the clock as it read 8:01 am, and time stood still.

III. WHISPERING DREAMS, SO YOUNG AND TIRED...the blinds werent enough to keep the cold out.  on nights like this when they couldnt fall asleep, they would lay on the still neatly pressed sheets talking about the future, the kids, the love that would only grow with time.  he loved the way her nose scrunched up when she laughed, and she loved the way, he could get so serious about what he thought.  they would talk until they sleep took over and took them away.  the clock flashed 8:01 am and that was they last thing they saw.  and time stood still.

IV. IN THE EVENT THAT TODAY NEVER ENDS...the blinds werent enough to keep the snow from brushing up against the glass.  it was nights like these they would sleep closer.  arm in arm. and he would sing to himself, though loud enough for her to hear, ""it's times like these you learn to love again..."".  she loved the way he would interrupt abruptly into a song, and he loved the way she pretended not to mind him stopping her in conversation to sing a verse or 2.  he leaned in till his nose touched hers and smiled, ""i wish tonight would never end..."".  he looked over at the clock, it screamed 8:01 am, and time stood still. 

V.  THE CALENDAR HUNG ITSELF, DAY, AFTER DAY, AFTER DAY...the blinds werent enough to hide the star in which heard his request.  spread across elegantly disheveled sheets they quietly dreamed.  a calendar read November 18, 2004, and a clock blinked 8:01 am.  and time stood still."

"event","I. SUMMER HAS COME AND PAST, THE INNOCENT CAN NEVER LAST...so he took the long way home, he loves taking the long way, it helped him appreciate what he had in the place he called home, before he'd move away, but amidst this drive home, he found desire.  driving down the long stretch of concrete he passed the place where he would always be there for her, a place, he'd wait 30 minute even for her to come out and be surprised.  with a smirk he remembers the way he could fix everything by just surprising her there, and remind her how beautiful she was...he often reminded himself as well, when he'd forget.  but now when he passes this haunt, all he sees are ghost...a boy sitting in his car, a girl coming out and seeing the car, and smiling knowing that everything was going to be okay, even if it was just for that moment.  the ghost seemed to re-enact every emotion, every smile, to every level they feel more in love, with perfection.  this place also holds sentimental value as the place where everything was given back, and taken away at the same time.  as he drives by he can see the spot he waited for her to come out.  again the ghost re-enacted her reaction, this time, not of surprise but of knowing what was coming, the pain building in his eyes, but successfully held in by the fear of her seeing him cry, she left what she had taken, and that was it.  the windows rolled up, and the cars started, and went their seperate ways, and every memory they ever had was split in 2, but holding by only strands.  as he passes the building and all it's glory, a tear slides down his cheek, as he cheeks to see if her car, might, for some reason, may be waiting there, beckoning him to wait till she comes out.  and it never was.

II. IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL YOURE UNDERGROUND...of all the teenage love affairs he'd experienced, this is the only one that still lingers in his mind.  every now and then, a scent of her perfume drifts by, and letters sent are re-read over and over again, until his vision is blurred with regret...that and tears.  then he asks himself ""what is it about her? why do i think about her so much?""  ""i didnt love her, but i miss her so much and get jealous even at the thought of her with someone else"" thus the result of his depression through his last years of high school, that was very well hidden.  trips past midnight to and from her house, picking her up when she needed him, him always being there, are all in her shadows but walk right next to him.  ""somehow i wasnt enough"" and that is the statement, that has eaten at him for a little over a year.  love over lust always win.  he was the latter, as well, as the other guy.

III. AT THE CENTER OF THE EARTH IN THE PARKING LOT, OF THE 7-11 WHERE I WAS TAUGHT...everything he knew about love had been crushed in a simple phone call, and questions to himself ""maybe if i wasnt such a jealous guy,  things coulda been different.""  he had found his character flaw, or is it a flaw, it's all in personal opinion, and to him, this flaw showed everything.  everything he thought he knew about her, was wrong, and yet he still thinks of her when he passes this landmark building of tanning and massages.

IV. DEARLY BELOVED ARE YOU LISTENING...in a small house, every thought of him was shot to hell for a short 30 minutes while she fell into the arms of a liar.  he sometimes last to himself now, and indulges in having the last laugh, knowing he was the best piece of jewelry she would never wear around her neck again.  she had it all, and threw it in the trash.  and she drives now sometimes on the same stretch of concrete and passes this small buildings when shes in town, and thinks of calling him, but doesnt, for fear of his response, her fear of hurting him again, and she sets her phone down again next to her, as a tear drys on her cheek.  there he was parked there, in the same spot he let go over her at.  waiting...and she drove by.

""and i will do this for you as well (more bullsh*t)"" (crowd cheers again)...wait, then you question yourself...""hey he never said how, he is just making claims people will like and not saying how he will meet these demands""...this is because he doesnt want to tell you he's gonna have to raise taxes to do this or that, or that he's just saying what you want to hear, because we all know that the next morning he's not gonna feel the same way if you dont...go ahead and look up the countless times he has made a decision and changed it, this even with documents and his signature...let's not forget as well, he doesnt even know how to pronounce genghis khan, lol...

IN '97, EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT CAUSE WE WERE YOUNG AND HOPEFUL...i've got it now, a thorn in my side the size of a cadillac, drive it on through, cause backing up now would be next to impossible, i had it all, when i was with you i forgot about everything, eighteen monthes, eighteen monthes seems like f-in eternity...but you'll be there, to dry my eyes when i breathe you in, in ninety seven, in ninety seven...ive got it now, a thorn in my side the size of a cadillac drive it on through, because backing up now would be next to impossible, i had it all, when i was with you i forgot about everything, eighteen monthes...i wont breathe for eighteen monthes, i dont deserve this, no i dont deserve this, no i dont deserve this, no i dont deserve this...- alk3

"event","CHAPTER 1
THE BEGINNING NEVER ENDS...everything is spinning, why?  i really cant recall, in fact, i cant remember anything...amnesia?  no it cant be i dont have that, do i?  it's just the last thing i can remember is her.  her smile sinking into me, her blue eyes i always spoke so highly of, her voice, god, it was amazing, when she spoke to me everything, and i mean, everything was gone, it didnt matter, all i could see, hear, touch, and feel, was her, she was like this star, the only star in the galaxy and everything else was black, like night, and this was just when id see her and hear her, now the hard part is going to be remembering who she was...a task i wont give up on until i know...and that is the thing i am most afraid of.  by the way, where am i?  small room, pretty tight space, not the best thing for someone who is clostrophobic, let's just for now call this MY room.  sounds good to me.  11:11 am, i guess i should get up, let's see, clothes need clothes...jeans, are a little tight, but hey, i love them that way, and shirt, the same, but who does like that...wait wait wait, these arent my pants...nor this vintage shirt, something is definitely rather wrong with this picture...well, i guess things will piece themselves together today, now, to more important things, where is my car?

CHAPTER 2
IT'S RIGHT ON THE TIP OF MY TONGUE, I JUST CANT SAY IT...a nissan altima isnt half bad i guess, although it is rather strange there are, articles of clothing, and well, empty boxes of...well let's just say, i really dont even know if this is my car, who's keys these are, and well, who was in this car last...now secretly, like any guy, in the back of my mind, this idea that i may have possibly gotten lucky the night before brings a smile to my face...but then is completely ruined by the fact that someone else may have...ah the sweet taste of disgust.  thus the cause for my decision to walk today.  so going by the buildings and crowded busy streets i'd say this is new york, god i hate northern accent, i can already tell this is not going to be my best day...i dont think.  so the sidewalks are a little damp, must have rained, and every person i encounter, seems a bit on the bitchy side, but these days in new york who wouldnt be, how can you be happy on an overcast day...didnt think you could.  hmm 5 bucks is all i've got, how the hell am i suppose to, for starters, get some breakfast, wait, it's almost lunch time, so i have to find a way to eat, and find her, you know, her, like in every story...today is just gonna be one mess after the other, but hey where better to start a search then at your local diner.

CHAPTER 3
THINGS WILL GET BETTER IF SHE'D BE JUST AROUND THE NEXT BLOCK...with a full stomach and only 2.25 left, i guess im ready for anything in my way, even if that means doing the impossible, finding her, it's like finding waldo, you know, where's waldo?  no?  nevermind...so after fingering through a few notes in these jeans and getting well...nothing but a buisiness card to an ""entertainment"" store, 2 blocks away, why not...whoa, what's this, and then it hit me, there she was...no not at the store, but a picture of her, folded up in the pocket of whose ever these jeans belong to...god, her smile is amazing, her lips, perfect, her eyes, blue, no, slightly blue and slightly green, they are so bright, and her hair, dirty blonde, honestly who doesnt want that.  this picture only made my goal, more like that of a desire, not something i wanted to do, but something i have to do...so the building, the most disgusting place i've ever been, just, dirty, there is no way she's here, or ever was, a building full of crack addicts, and prostitutes, no reason to waste time here, but why the hell was this card even in my pocket?  or someones pocket?  i wonder if i've already seen her today, no no, i know, where does everyone in new york go?  where would i want to go...exactly, central park.

CHAPTER 4
SO MUCH FOR THE PLACE WE MET, IT'S NOT LIKE I REMEMBER THEM ANYWAY...constantly, i keep thinking this is it, but who knows, i do think way too much, i mean hell, i dont even know how i got here, or whos clothes im wearing.  i keeping thinking this will make a good story some day.  it's 1:30 pm, and my luck is fading in the park, sure there are beautiful people, but none that can come close to comparing to her.  why not stop someone, well why not, i do have her picture.  ""excuse me, have you seen her""  ""no?""  ""alright thanks.""  so that does it, wait, what?  maybe you have?  where.  56th street, at the corner of gretchen?  thanks.  so we have a clue, not much of one and one that prolly wont get me anywhere, but why not.  these cars are so terrible, loud, everywhere, and terribly pollutive, maybe it's messing with my head, maybe that's why i cant remember anything, no no that cant be it, people live in this everyday.  56th street, at the corner of gretchen!  and nothing?  what the hell?  this is where she said to go, these are the directions, this is just a broken down abandon building, there is no way she is here, at least, i hope to God she's not, but, sometimes, there is a desire to look anyway, so i did.

CHAPTER 5
THE ANSWERS ARE NEVER IN THE PLACES THEY SHOULD BE...broken glass, boarded doors, not quite the place to find love, but what do i know, i cant even tell you what i did yesterday, or even who i met, i only know one thing, and that's her.  i've always pictured the day for, well i really dont know how long, it may have just come strong today, but the day i find her, everything will be perfect, so much in love, just like we were, if we were.  then there someone was, crouched over, shaking.  ""should i say something?""  ""no no dont that'd be stupid, they may have something on them""  ""yeah youre right""...so are you okay.  ""do i look okay to you""  okay so maybe that wasnt the best question to start a conversation with.  ""well, i was just wondering, have you seen her""  no?  yes?  sometimes i wish people could make up their damn minds, indecisive people really do piss me off, if anything.  ""no?""  okay thanks.  so something didnt feel right about that woman, in the robe croutched over, bad vibe i guess, something i dont want to be confronted with again.  2:25 pm, this day has gone from ok, to worse, to straight shot to hell, why not go back to the apartment and crash, but something wasnt right, it's dark, not like it should be at 2:25 pm, it's early in the day, it should be sunny, even slightly, with the over cast, and everything was gone.  something is very wrong.

CHAPTER 6
NO NO NO THIS ISNT IT, SHE ISNT SUPPOSE TO BE...dead?  there is no way she is.  i would have been to the funeral...at least i think i would have been.  where is everyone, no one is on the streets walking their daily routine and busy lives neglecting their families, if only they were in my shoes.  one last stroll, by myself i might add through central.  ""wait, who's that""  ""i dont know, go and ask""  ""no no, it cant be""  her eyes were bright, her lips moved in slow motion, her smile, god, her smile just burned me up, in a good way though, she was there, right in front of me.  everything i expected, then i heard her, everything dissappeared.  ""go home now"" no no no i just found you.  ""no you didnt, im not real"" no you are, i swear you are, this is...you are what ive been looking for, i found you, let's be happy, let's go to the apartment.  ""that's not yours, none of this is, youve made all this up, in your mind, i am who you want, but you cant have, because i am something your imagination created""  suddenly, it hit me, the clothes, the car, the city, the people, the home, none of this was real, but no, there is no way i can create a completely different universe, a branched off universe of my own.  ""just let go, youre chasing things you will never have, all you have now, is what you want, but will never have""  she slowly began to lose her color, her perfect skin was growing pale, her eyes, were gray, and dull, her smile...was never there, the picture, was blank.  everything was gone, and it was black, everything was black.  then a voice, ""we're losing him, pulse is dropping, 1..2..3..clear...a pause, 1..2..3..clear...he's gone...""  a long beep, then silence, and darkness.  just as it was at 11:10 am."

"event","yes... here i sit. alone in the dark crying over an ex boyfriend. who turned out to be a real jerk, and doesn't give a shit less about me anymore.

and knowing this. here i sit. i sit and cry over what was and what isn't. i hate it that i miss him. i miss everything about him. i miss him so bad i'd give almost anything just to fight with him one more time. just to hear his voice. but he doesn't care about me. not any more. and i'm sitting here wondering if he's better off. i know my friends, out of the kindness of their hearts and love for me, would say i deserve so much better and that he's stupid for letting me go. but is that the truth? or is it just a sugar coated version of what's really there? i know that in the end we simply weren't meant to be... i just wish it hurt less. 

and this event has drained me so much, and made me bitter. i don't know how, when, or if i can ever trust my heart with another male. because no matter what, the story ends the same. my heart and emotions ripped to shreds. how i hate it. trust can be such an aweful thing. it's not that i never want to be in love again.. or never have another boyfriend, but the whole time i'm just going to be waiting for the end. and if all you have to look forward to is your ultimate destination, can you enjoy the ride? 

this is what i get for staying up till 6 in the morning. sick and walking down a not so bright memory lane. alas... i have stopped crying. that's something."

"event","I wish i could forget. forget everything about the last year. i don't really hurt anymore. but the fact that i've become so numb makes me sad. i can't feel anything for anyone but him. every song i hear makes me think of him. he's always on my mind. it doesn't hurt. not really. i just miss him a lot. why is this? he did me so wrong... he won't even talk to me now... and i didn't even do anything wrong. so why do i miss him... why is that i'd give anything for him to be mine one more time... just for a day... an hour... a minute... who cares? just one more anything! i'd give anything to tell him that i love him right this second. that i miss him and i don't want things to end this way. i'd do anything to hold him and kiss him one last time... but he's gone. he's with someone else (i'm only like 75% sure of that one). he obviously doesn't care anymore... or he'd be here now... he's over me and i'm stuck here in a ghost world full of memories of him, of us. i can't be sure of my emotions anymore. all i feel is hurt... when i can feel at all. this'll get better.. i know it will."

I'm not broken.
Trust me, I'm just fine.

God heals all wounds in time.

I HATE SHOE SHOPPING!!! hate it. never like going. seriously.. i usually have what i want in mind, and go get it, get out.. and move on to fun shopping. like guitars ^_^! k not really, but it's a nice thought right? i guess i'm an odd case. i don't like big expensive gifts.. when/if my future husband proposes to me.. i seriously won't ask how many carots it is or anything. it could be fake, and as long as it looks pretty, i prolly wouldn't care. i'd rather have a single rose white rose than a dozen red ones. i dunno. i'm not normal. but i am okay. that i am. well.. i have some reading to do. *peace love and rock* buh-bye"

OMG. ya know that feeling you get when you see something.. like you've seen it before, but can't for the life of you think when.. starts with a d.. french word.. dunno how to spell it.. anyway! the other day i was waiting in the hall to ask Cody if i could borrow his MP3.. and omg i felt it. i was standing there and.. it was something.. like a dream. it was like time stopped for a second. i swear to you.. omg it was sooooo strange. gawd. there was just something in the way we were standing in the hall i guess. and i swear to you.. for what seemed like a long time.. time stood still. i swear it. omg i can't get over it. *shivers*. and then last night i had the DUMBEST..

Lyrics for Song: I Can't Unlove You


Postcards and letters 
And pictures made to last forever
To be boxed up and tossed away
Knickknacks and souvenirs
In an afternoon, they're out of here
They'll disappear without a trace
But what they mean to me
Can never be replaced

I can't unthink about you
I can't unfeel your touch
I can't unhear all the words
Unsay all the things
That used to mean so much
I wish I could unremember
Everything my heart's been through
And finding out it's impossible to do
Oh, it's no use
I can't unlove you

Intestates and old songs
Like time they go on and on
I guess I could learn to do the same
I could wake up without you
These two arms not around you
Tell myself it's meant to be this way
No matter how I try I can't change

I can't unthink about you
I can't unfeel your touch
I can't unhear all the words
Unsay all the things
That used to mean so much
I wish I could unremember
Everything my heart's been through
And finding out it's impossible to do
Oh, it's no use
I can't unlove you

I wish I could unremember
Everything my heart's been through
And finding out it's impossible to do
Oh, oh, it's no use
I can't unlove you</center>

this is kinda how i feel right now."

dad made me so mad today. he just yells at me for no damn reason other than he's being an asshole at the moment. i mean really. k here's what happened. this chick calls (telemarketer) and is like foreign okay. and mom like tells her that she's too busy to talk and that she needs to call back at a different time. and like 5 seconds after my mom hangs up.. the chick calls back! i didn't know that mom had said that.. so i answer the phone, thinking dad was being a jerk and hung up on her (he was who she asked for). so i like tell him that she's on the phone again... AND HE YELLS AT ME! i'm not the idiot who called back.. i was relaying a damn messege! and he yells at me. so i said ""i'm sorry i didn't realize what happened"" and he yells some more. saying i coped an attitude. i love that. no matter what i say to him.. i'm having an attitude. and i prolly wouldn't have been so upset over it.. except it was in front of my out of state family. and my aunt like gave me a pitty look cause of it. mom felt the need to appologize for him. and i was just like whatever. 30 minutes to an hour later he says he's sorry for hurting my feelings and yelling at me. save it. appologize to our family.. i'm sure it was just as bad for them as it was for me. how embarrassing. it's not the first time he's humiliated me in front of 'company' either. not the worst he's done tho.. by far. *gah* that just makes me mad. i can't ever do anything good enough for him. and i try. i do. if i draw something i think is kewl.. or mom and kelly said was kewl... i like show him. and he's like yea? makes me mad.

Some examples of why the human race has probably evolved as far as possible. These are actual instruction labels on consumer goods:

On Sears hairdryer:
Do not use while sleeping.
(Gee, that's the only time I have to work on my hair!)

On a bag of Fritos:
You could be a winner! No purchase necessary. Details inside.
(The shoplifter special!)

On a bar of Dial soap:
Directions: Use like regular soap.
(and that would be how?)

On some Swann frozen dinners:
Serving suggestion: Defrost.
(But it's 'just' a suggestion!)

On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert: (printed on bottom of the box)
Do not turn upside down.
(Too late! you lose!)

On Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding:
Product will be hot after heating.
(Are you sure? Let's experiment.)

On packaging for a Rowenta iron:
Do not iron clothes on body.
(But wouldn't that save more time?)
(Whose body?)

On Boot's Children's cough medicine:
Do not drive car or operate machinery.
(We could do a lot to reduce the construction accidents if we just kept those 5 year olds off those fork lifts.)

On Nytol sleep aid:
Warning: may cause drowsiness.
(One would hope!)

On a Korean kitchen knife:
Warning: keep out of children.
(hmm...something must have gotten lost in the translation...)

On a string of Christmas lights:
For indoor or outdoor use only.
(As opposed to use in outer space.)

On a food processor:
Not to be used for the other use.
(Now I'm curious.)

On Sainsbury's peanuts:
Warning: contains nuts.
(but no peas?)

On an American Airlines packet of nuts:
Instructions: open packet, eat nuts.
(somebody got paid big bucks to write this one...)

On a Swedish chainsaw:
Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands.
(Raise your hand if you've tried this...)

On a child's Superman costume:
Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly.
(Oh go ahead! That's right, destroy a universal childhood belief.)"

"event","Fancy that... I'm updating again. yea. Now, I don't know for sure, who exactly reads this... but I assume that the only two people who even look at it (once in a great while) are Magoo and Ej. Knowing this... it seems odd... even to me, that i'd even keep a journal. Well... it's mostly for me. I update here, to get things out of my system. And deep down I know, that no one else reads this.. that even people who know I have a Lj, have better things to do than read it. Mkk. 

Cody and Chantry have joined the NAVY. I have to admit, that I really don't like that little fact. If I had any say, what so ever... they'd be going to college and doing something for a living that wouldn't have a chance for them to get hurt. We're practically in a war for crying out loud! But since I don't have a say, in what either of them do... doesn't really matter how I feel about it, does it? I feel bad for Brianna, because he fiance, Blake is joining the Army. I'm pretty sure she dealed with it better when he told her, than when Cody told me. I know it's gotta bother her.. but she goes on like it doesn't. I don't see how. Maybe she's stronger than me. In fact, I'm sure she is. She's had to become pretty tough, with all she's been through with parents and her brother. Things that, hopefully, I'll never understand. 

As I get futher into my Junior year, it becomes painfully obvious that I'm almost grown up. One day.. high skool.. everything about it, will be a distint memory. And someday within the next year and a half, I'll be making my own decisions... and out on my own. Hopefully I'll be in a good college.. getting a degree. I don't even know what I want to do.. what I want to be. I don't know. And that scares me. I so know, that I won't be stuck in this crap town for the rest of my life. I've put up with too much crap, from the people who live here.. I don't want that for the rest of my life. I dread the last day of skool. I dread walking into the cafetorium for the Senior graduation... because when it ends, that's what I'll be... a Senior. That is so scary to me. How did time pass do fast? Some people are counting down the days.. I'm wishing it wasn't soo soon. I want to be done with high skool, don't get me wrong. I want out of high skool almost more than anything. I think that it'll be hard for me to leave my friends and teachers. I'll live. 

I think I'll be leaving now. *peace love and rock* buh-bye"

OMG! yesterday it was ""wear red day"" (for red ribbon week). and the girls on STUCO were passing around red lipstick and kissing people on the face. i wasn't gonna do that, cause honestly it was retarded. but then i got attacked! so i had to do it back to them, and get this little 7th grader right on the forehead. lol. but then.. later, i made a mistake. see, there's this guy and i guess he's got a crush on me or something (but i ssoooo don't feel the same) and i kissed him on the cheek, and like he grabbed me (not in a bad way) but like *shudders* not the response i wanted. that was his second kiss though, he didn't do that the first time i gave him one. and what's worse, cody was kinda around where we were (i hope he didn't see). if i was to upset him by doing something like that, i'd feel really bad. cause i'm not one to ""get even"" or seek revenge, or anything like that. and i think it's kinda petty trying to make someone jealous. so yea.. i just ended up feeling bad about all that. so i'm kinda figuring i was in the wrong on that one (duh). but yea, anyways... red lipstick looks really bad on me. lol.
it's weird, i kinda feel numb to all this. like, i was upset (sad w/e) and now it's like.. i still like him and w/e, but i didn't deserve how he treated me (the last week we were together) so it's like, i feel sad, but not really. cause i'm kinda mad that he treated me that way... but then i'm not mad...just kinda hurt, but then i don't really think on it too much so in the end i guess i don't feel anything. weird, i know. i know all that will change before anytime at all... so w/e. i g2g. *peace love and rock* buh-bye lovely ones."

I wish sooo badly that he wasn't going to the Navy. It really makes me sad. I mean, just because of the war we're fighting right now. I mean he's at such a risk of getting hurt. I don't know what I'd do if anything bad actually happened to him. I only say that as his friend though. I pray Cody doesn't read that.. he doesn't really like it, considering Chantry's and mine's history, that we're anything close to friends. We aren't close like we were last year, or even the year before... but it still bugs him a lil. So usualy I keep my 'Chantry' comments to myself. lol. Out of respect for Cody of course. I love him. I really do. He's my baby ^_^! and he loves me too. We're going on 6 months *squeels*!!! Oct. 9th. i know it's not THAT close, but it's pretty darn close. lol.

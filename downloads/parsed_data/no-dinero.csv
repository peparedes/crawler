things are good/great/kind of! i feel really justified when i think people are jerks, but really i am just a childish jerk, you know?

things:

<li> wrong white balance </li>
<li> physics test </li>
<li> college apps </li>
<li> phone talking </li>
<li> naps </li></blockquote>

we got some new dogberts but just for a little bit. zeekbot is such a weird looker, huhhh. i am working so much lately i'm glad for school to start. i put my bicycle outside during work and then it rained, rained. my seat got so wet and soggy. http://www.thislife.org/pages/descriptions/02/218.html what are your favoritesssss! i got a new camera from vv and its lens  is not as wide as my yaschica, but his shutter is just as loud, but hopefully he doesn't have the light leaks because i do hate taping up my camera especially when the adhesive melts and you get it everywhere. i finished <u>everything is illuminated</u>, and it made me cry so much! the film will, with hope, be a very premium one."

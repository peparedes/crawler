<P>i went out to eat with the family blah blah who cares about that shit. around 5ish me and aymee left for philly for the dashboard concert and it was so fucking awesome!!!</P>
<P>finally when dashboard came on i was so excited it freaking took forever but it was well worth the wait. after a couple songs Chris said he had a special annoucement to make. He said ""Today is Meg Ryan's birthday and i would like to say a special happy birthday to you, come up on stage"" so me and Aymee were freaking out and we went up on stage and he sang me a song as he held me in his muscular arms! it was the most amazing thing in the world.&nbsp;and we got to hang out with them after the concert and shit.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

"event","when i was down you came to me
and promised to always be by my side
now youre gone and i'm waiting patiently-

sometimes it seems youre not with me
it hurts me so much - it hurts me so much-


i miss aymee.. i miss everything.. and i don't get it. i don't even understand what happened.. maybe i did something - i usually do.. yeah it's probably all my fault. i find ways to fuck up everything but then i can never find ways to fix it. i hate crying. it doesn't solve anything. i just wanna rewind. to before-to the day where we layed in the hammack and when we came inside and took soo many pictures. then she got them developed and we looked at them and ate Rita's and went to target. and we bought shoes together. then we sat outside and talked on the phone right next to each other and laughed so incredibly loud that the people that worked there came out to see what we were doing. and then the next day we wore our shoes...i think. why can't we be so-in-love anymore? what happened? what changed? why? if we both want it back well then why isn't it back? how do you get it back? what do you have to do? where's my best friend?
it hurts. everything hurts. why? WHY? i don't understand anything. i just don't fucking get it. i don't get it..
i wanted to talk to her so badly yesterday. i wanted to jump on her a give her a big hug and tell her how much i missed her. but i didn't. i didn't know how she would respond. i didn't want to be the only one excited to be with eachother. so i just held it in. and i wanted to talk. about <b>everything</b>. like we used to. but we hardly talked at all. and it kind of upset me. cause i want to be able to talk about anything with her again. but i don't know what to say. i don't want to upset her by talking about something that she doesn't want to talk about.

tomorrow--tomorrow everything will be fine. right?!"

monday-*went down the shore with kyle and pat. soo much fuN! i wanted to invite aymee but we didn't decide to go until late sunday night and i didn't want to be annoying and call her house at late hours and wake up her mom cause that's not cool. plus i wasn't sure if she was home anyways..mighta stayed at her daddys but i dunno

friday-* i had a party. i did not have a good time. it sucked and im never having a party again. if other people had fun then thats great just never at my house again!

saturday-* mike's party. oh jeez. me and aymee went to the basement drank some beers with jenn. jenn is awesome. made fun of people. then after awhile mike ran outta beer so he kept on giving me gin and a lot of it. and i didn't feel so good. then me and aymee saw steph and mark and i don't really remember going into the bathroom but i guess we did. then somehow we were outside. i remember sitting in a circle and im not sure who was in the circle and then i don't remember anything else. but people told me what happened. and...im sorry. the next thing i remember is im in the bathroom again. then im outside. then im inside again and a cop comes in. oh shit. there was a sober driver and he could take 5 people so we pretended he was gonna drive us. but we just hid in the bushs cause i didn't want to leave aymee. i didn't know what was happening to her or where she was. we hid there for a long time until someone told me that she wasn't in the house anymore. then we went to my house and were locked out for 4 hours. wonderful...

sunday -* defiantly time for a chill day haha. food shopping. horse shoes over aymee. i defiantely tore that shit up hahaha. we watched Now and Then. i haven't seen that in so long. good shit.

dan is a weird kid. he's addicted to cereal and longs for some sweet loving from a nice woman friend. although, he pretends that he gave up on searching. we all know his quest is on-going. he makes hemp bracelets like a mad man. what a nice kid. for some reason he sucks at burning me cds when he says he will. like he said he would burn me the new senses fail cd. but i have yet to receive it. i didn't even ask for it. he just said he would burn it for me BUT HE DIDN'T!! but it's okay cause he's a busy man with all his hemp making and whatnot. he almost got pantsed today. doesn't that stink?!

"event","hey just got home. yesterday was pretty fun. jess came over and we ate some dinner mmmm .. then aymee came over. we went to janines house and me jess aymee janine charlene katey and lyndsie walked to applebees. i saw my dad when we were walking by, it was pretty cool. i wasn't even hungry but i couldn't stop eating. those boneless chicken wings are SO fucking good. then jess had to go home :(  and ian and tj came to pick the rest of us up. we went back to daves house to chill drink some beers and watch the fight. so that was cool ya know we were just sitting there chillen, drinkin, watchin the fight and as SOON as the main fight was about to start, the power went off! WHAT THE HELL!!!! and immediatly as the power went off this kid grabbed aymee and tried to get with her. she went with the NO NO NO method. and he kept talking to her all night and became like obsessed with her. she was really weirded out by him. well some people left and then it was getting late and there was nothing to do and still no power. so we were gonna walk to the lake and go swimming. immediatly as we left the house, the power went back on. it was real weird. so me aymee janine charlene marlo josh chip dave and brian went to the lake and i didn't wanna go swimming but eventually i did and i lost my fucking thumb ring! so we went back to daves house and watched How High. me and aymee were laying together talking and laughing a lot. i really liked it. i like it when we just laugh about everything. it's really nice. josh kept rubbing my feet and my legs and holding my hand and stuff. i didn't want to leave aymee alone cause brian kept asking if he could lay with us but obviously there was no room. so i just sat up and watched the movie. most people fell asleep. i went to bed around 6-6:30 and we left around 7 so that was cool i got tons of sleep.. ha..
alright dawgs i don't even know why i wrote out almost every single thing that happened. i'm just bored like that. awesome. sleepy timee!!!"

"event","wow i don't think i've updated all week. kinda busy i guess..

well on wednesday in english we had to watch Antigone so i wrote danielle a note that i miss her and she said wanna hang out friday or saturday and i said yeah let's hang friday and she said okay wanna go to the movie with me angee kris and the girls and i said yeah sounds like fun.

yesterday my dad came home and got mad at me? so he wouldn't take me. so kyklebutt drove me cause he loves me. and then i saw JESS and i JUMPEDDD on her and she actually caught me and held me up man i was soo happy to see her. i know i see her everyday in school but i havent hung with her since like my party i think. yaaaa i can't wait til tonight!! so anyways then me danielle angee jasmine kris and lauren saw mean girls. then after we were gonna go to some college party but we didn't. i didn't really wanna go haha. i felt like i didn't belong. i feel like i don't know danielle anymore. the way she talked with angee and did't talk to me at all reminded me of the way she used to talk to me and ignore everyone else. i almost cried in the car. cause they were talking and laughing having a good time reminising and i was just sitting in the back looking out the window thinking and holding back tears. i thought about last year. i thought about the summer. i missed danielle even though she was sitting right in front of me. hanging out with her isn't going to make me stop missing her. because when i hang out with her angee has to be there and i can't hang out with the old danielle. the danielle that used to put me before everything. she's never coming back. danielle and i will never be close like we used to man. man when we were best friends i don't even remember one time when i was sad. except for the time when she got with manny. then i got sad. then she stopped being my best friend. then my saddness never stopped.

i don't belong. i don't fit. i've tried to hang out with a bunch of different groups of people and i don't fit in with any of them. i'm not accepted. and it's hard. it's real hard. and no one understands. i just want to start over. i suck at life. maybe if i get another try i can change and be different and i can be good at it. but that'll never happen. and i'll always suck.

some reason i have a feeling that aymee got with ray last night. i'm not sure so i'm gonna wait til she tells me. if she does tell me. i don't know. i know she still likes him and he still likes her and all that. but i don't think it's a good idea if they keep getting with each other. because now there's nothing stopping him from getting with other girls but i know aymee wouldn't get with another guy. she's not like that she just woudldn't be able to do that. and i don't want her to get hurt again. 

i'm gonna go outside and listen to music and think."

"event","yesterday i went to brooklyn for my cousins communion party. it was nice. except for before we left my dad and my brother were flipping some major shit on me i have no idea why and i cried the way there cause i can't handle being yelled at and having people mad at me. i think that i work around other people's emotions. i never really express my own emotions. i don't know what i'm trying to say. well anyways me and kyle had some rum and coke and then some beers then some seven and sevens. me and my favorite aunt lori were happily drunk together. i have pics i might post them if i remember. it was actually a lot of fun.

i hate my dad. i hate him alot. i don't know if i can forgive him. i don't really want to talk about it and i don't think that i'm gonna discuss this with anyone. just gotta get it out somehow. i'm really really upset with him. i don't want to talk to him. i don't even want to go near him.

gotta go meet aym at the park we needa talk
much love<3

<b> *</ edit > </b>
i just got back from talking with aymee. the real reason that ray broke up with her was not what he told her. and that made her pissed. i feel real bad cause she doesn't deserve any of this. i don't want her to think that it's her fault but i guess it's hard thinking that it's not your fault when the same exact thing happens every time. believe me, i know what it's like. also, she told me that mark never even liked me haha. thats kinda funny cause every guy that i got with didn't actually like me. i dunno i guess it's just something about me? what can ya do kinda sucks but guys aren't the most important thing so i'm not worried. so then i told her about my little situation. i guess she didn't know what to say. i mean if we switched places and she was the one telling me i wouldn't know what to say either. when i got home i talked to pat on the phone and he told me that he thought the same thing to. but i told him that he doesn't understand it's for real this time and he said just ignore it that's what he does just don't think about it. alright well im out again, bitches. lovelove<3"

kyle and pat were real drunk. they were taking turn talking to me. it was cute. i miss them."

and i just called aymee cause i wanted to talk and get back in a good mood cause i wanna figure out why i'm not in a good one. but no one picked up. and she has no minutes left on her cell. shit man. i suck."

"event","today kinda sucked a little. heres how it went:

got up late, when i was getting ready my phone rang and i was like shit aymees not coming to school today. and i was right, she called to tell me her knee was hurting so she wasn't coming. so right away i knew this day wouldn't be too good. eww this morning damien put a stink bomb in the red hall-GROSS! why couldnt he put it in the blue hall?! that would've made more sense but whatever.. so i was talking to christy a lot today and in chem she said something that really made me think. at the end of class i was like: you know what, youre exactly right. and she was shocked. i never admit to her when she's right. well she said that ever since manny i've been scared to be in a realtionship because of what he did. shes exactly right. i've never been able to trust <b>anyone</b> since that. what he did was like super fucked up and i don't know. so i was thinking about all the guys since him. and i didn't allow myself to like anyone since that. like, if i got with someone i would stop talking to them and aviod them just to make sure that i wouldn't become attached and get hurt. then aymee showed me that you have to take risks in life. you can't shelter yourself from emotions and feelings that are just natural. you can't prevent heartache-its inevitable ... but it's worth it all. but first i just want to be happy with myself. once i am completly happy with myself then eventually everything will work itself out. i've been trying to be happy with myself for a long time now. it's not working out too well. i don't think im making any sense right now. my head hurts and i can't think. i know what i want to say and i know what i'm thinking but i don't know how to put it into words.

but anyways today kinda sucked. pretty sure i already said that tho... i love jess super a lot and i miss hanging out with her. but im going to prom friday then shes busy saturday then next friday SHES going to prom then i have to go to my cousins party saturday DAMNIT! well anywayss christys boyfriend broke up with her today she called me up mad crying i had to idea what to do. all i could say was im sorry and guys suck.? 

alright my foot just fell asleep and i HATE it when it does that but it does it all the timeee!! peacee. much love <3"

friday me and aymee went tanning then we walked to marks house and chilled there for awhile. played with sarah and watched some old school nick and cabin fever->gross. there was this one part where this guy is fingering this girl while shes sleeping and then he looks at his hand and its all bloody and her vagina is all decreped and falling apart and then when i was taking a shower the next day i was thinking of that part in the movie and i looked in the mirror and there was this red dot below my sholder i was like AH I HAVE CABIN FEVER! but i didnt it was just a sticker. and now today i have this bump where the sticker was OH NO!! haha. oh yeah and im in love with beenz. too bad he doesnt love me.

saturday i went over adrianas and we met up with jenn and walked all freaking day long. my feet hurt so bad. we walked so far in their neighborhood..we walked to where they didnt even know existed in their own freaking development! WHATT!! then jenns sister drove us back to berlin and aymee came over and we all ate then merv and his friend drove to my house then chappell and his friend steve and some kid dave came too. we were just standing in a circle in the middle of the road so i was nice and let them come in my house. then we all went to the park to meet up with rob. then we just stood there and talked til everyone went home.

today was the tla. me aymee blayne mark ed and dunston went. theyre a funny group of people. they make me laugh. AW MAN! GROSS! there was this one really drunk guy and he kept staring at me and aymee then we walked up and put his arm around me and asked if i had a boyfriend and i was just like uhhh...yeah right there! and he was like really thats youre man and i was like umm..yup.. and then he mumbuled something to mark and asked if aymee had a boyfriend and thats when we walked away. it was a good time except for i had to get up mad early and now im so tired!

shit man i gotta do my homework. this sucks.

aymees such an awesome person and it seems like shes been feeling pretty down lately. she shouldnt have to be sad. shes too nice to be sad. shes freaking awesome. man, without aymee, i dont even know. i dont wanna know. she makes me so happy. even when im in the worst mood and i just cant smile she always finds a way to make me laugh. i hate it when shes upset i feel like theres something i should do to just make her super happy again but i dont know what to do. well, aymee i love you and everyone loves you so dont let stupid shit get to you and make you sad cause youre too cool to be sad."

ever since i almost fought gary's sisters i've been thinking about him. not the way i used to think about him though.. wow i was so stupid. i don't know WHY i thought i was gonna be the girl that was differnt or the girl that changed him. i was just another girl to add to his list. but i honestly thought it was different that time. i thought he actually meant all that he said. but it's never different. everything's always the same. and everything always sucks. at the time, thought, he seemed so sincere about it and it seemed like he actually liked me and didn't just want ass, but now that i look back on it, it was all my fault. i could've prevented it but i didn't want to. so i guess  it's a good thing? i don't know. who cares ... it's done and overwith and i can't get it back but i also don't want it back so that's good..

hmm i wish i was tan again. i was tan for like a month haha. now im pale again. me and aymee are gonna go tanning today whoop whoop! yeah that's another thing to add to my wish list haha. i wish i was freakin taN! haha

wellllllll-i might as well get this off my chest while i'm at it:
i really like him. a lot. there's no way he feels as much for me as i do for him. i don't know what it is. i don't know why. i just know i can't stop it. so if we don't move foward in our relationship that leaves us as friends, right? but i don't feel for him as just a friend. don't get me wrong, i'd love to be his friend. but i'm not saying that i want a boyfriend-girlfriend deal cause they never really work out for me. i'm not really good at those things anyways. i always mess shit up somehow. but i think this time it could be worth the risk. but i don't know. i just don't know. i'm so confused. i guess i'll just let things work themselves out and sit back and chill. but i can't chill. i can't stop thinking about it. it's taking over my thoughts. OH WELL sucks for meghan yet again.. just another thing to add to the list of Sucks For Meghannn!! hahaha

alright i'm out.
much love*x0x0"

"event","its 3:45 and i cant't sleep again. i went to bed at 5:30 last night. i just stay up and think about things and i can't sleep. kinda sucks. i tried to go to bed earlier me and aymee were both upset. i layed down and called jon but i wasn't talking at all so we hung up. then i just layed there and cried for a little then me and aymee went outside. when we came back in we talked about some serious stuff then we laughed and layed there. then she fell asleep and i just was thinking too much and i couldn't sleep so i came online. no one's really talking to me... mann..oh well i guess it is kinda late plus im boring and i suck..

i wish i could describe how i've been feeling lately. i've just been upset all the time over stupid shit. like really stupid shit that would normally not even phase me. these past few days have really pissed me off and made me very upset. there were some horrible times this spring break. but then again there were some very good times too.

pat came back down for the weekend. i was happy cause i wont see him for a long time. then next year hes going to australia for school. man i'm gonna miss him so much. no one really gets me like him. he's the only person that can really relate to me and not just pretend to. we're cool kids.

alright i don't know what else to say
later kidss
<33


ps- i let myself down and i suck."

"event","i havent updated in over a year. everyone started having these so i decided to write in it again.

this is the last night of spring break. spring break was kind of a disapointment. i was expecting more fun/less drama, all the happy bullshit that never seems to happen.

rob just called me to sneak out agian. haha fuck that.

so today i walked to aymees house to get her and we were walking back to my house and i was telling aymee a story and this group of puerto rican girls repeated what i was saying so i turned around and looked at them and they started yelling at me and so i defended myself and screamed right back. then one girl got up in my face and we pushed each other then some other girl broke it up. i was real pissed right after that and i didnt know what to do. i just walked all kinds of fast and called my friend to realease my anger onto him. then they sent over people to find out who we were so we got steph and found the girls again. turns out steph knew the girls. turns out i knew them too haha! well thats all over. so we came back to my house and THEY WERE HERE!! hahaha! kinda weird..

so then me and aymee went out back--ya know ya know and then my dad was looking for me cause he thought that i was going to find the girls to fight them? THEY WERE HERE WOULDNT I HAVE DONE IT WHEN THEY WERE AT MY HOUSE?! whatta stupid man..

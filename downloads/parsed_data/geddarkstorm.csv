Now... exercise and a good diet are probably the most important factors in health, but...<br /><br />It's a wonder that only about 55 and 57 years ago DNA/RNA and proteins, as we know them now, were brand new discoveries. In half a century, we've come from knowing nothing about these building blocks of life to sequencing and mapping our own genome and manipulating the DNA of lesser animals from flies to mice. This is a staggeringly short time, a scientific singularity, and as such every year major advances in our understanding of biology are made. Other than exercise and a good diet, let me go into four new &quot;breakthroughs&quot; that have been recently made in regards to the effects of the molecules Methylene Blue, Quercetin, Omega fatty acids, and Resveratrol on metabolism, immunology, cancer and ultimately life span; and how one can use these to increase your health and potentially life.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Methylene Blue""><br /><font size=""14"">Methylene Blue</font><br /><br /><u>History</u>: Methylene blue is a synthetic molecule that has been in use for over 100 years. It is typically used in industry as a dye for fabrics and DNA staining in biology. It is also used to treat methemoglobinemia disorder[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14579544?ordinalpos=20&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">1</a>], urinary track infections[<a href=""http://www.medicinenet.com/methylene_blue-oral/article.htm"">2</a>], and is an antidote to cyanide poisoning[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18742459?ordinalpos=36&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">3</a>]. It was, for a time, used successfully to treat malaria in soldiers doing the second world war, but was discontinued due to the soldiers not liking the side effects (blue urine, eye whites, and skin) caused by the high doses needed to kill the malaria parasite[<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue"">4</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14962363?ordinalpos=17&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">5</a>].<br /><br /><u>Effects</u>: Recently, it has been discovered that much lower doses than the 1-2mg of methylene blue used to treat methemoglobinemia have extraordinary unforeseen beneficial effects. For instance, low doses of methylene blue in the ~100 nanomolar (~30-100 micrograms in a human) range are able to inhibit tau protein fiber formation and stop Alzheimer's disease[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18619417?ordinalpos=52&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">6</a>]; increase mitochondrial function, and are capable of reversing mitochondrial dysfunction (the major source of aging), especially through the upregulation of Complex IV and anti-oxidant proteins; increase glycolysis independent of NAD  levels (increase metabolism); and increase in vitro cell life span by 40-50%, and whole mouse life span[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928358?ordinalpos=132&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">7</a>]. That is, <b>~100 nanomolar levels of methylene blue can stop and even reverse cellular senescence responsible for aging and neural degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, keeping neurons and cells youthful and healthy, protect the body from free radicals, and safely increase metabolism</b>.<br /><br /><u>Availability</u>: Methylene blue is very cheap. It comes relatively pure, with all the chemical analysis of it that I've seen showing heavy metal levels well below acceptable limits. This isn't surprising as methylene blue is used in fish tanks to kill parasites and fungi - but fish are very sensitive to heavy metals. One can find methylene blue at most science novelty shops, Walgreen in the southern part of the US (at least in Florida), pet stores, and on-line. It is a safe chemical, and toxic effects are not seen till around 70mg per kg of body weight per day in a mouse[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18685714?ordinalpos=47&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">8</a>]. That is, I'm 63.6 kilograms, but have a metabolic speed about 1/7th a mouse, so, I would have to eat 636 mg of methylene blue in one day to have any sort of the most minor adverse effects - WELL above the minuscule level of ~1000 micrograms (1 mg) per day needed to see its wondrous benefits (that is 600 times less than the lowest adverse dose). The lethal dose 50 (the dose needed to kill half of those who take it) is around 1000mg/kg in mice, or ~9 grams for a person of my weight. <br /><br />However <b>do NOT get the compound &quot;NEW METHYLENE BLUE&quot;</b>. This is a completely different molecule from methylene blue that is quite toxic, and has no beneficial attributes. Real methylene blue has the chemical CAS number 61-73-4. Do not get any version that has any CAS number different from this, or which is not sold in a general pharmaceutical/pet store.<br /><br /><u>Usage</u>: A 1% (10mg/ml) solution of methylene blue is what I have. Since it is absorbed around 30-50% via ingestion[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18810398?ordinalpos=36&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">9</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10952480?ordinalpos=15&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">10</a>], 30-100 microliters (300-1000 micrograms) of the 1% solution per day (I mix it with tea to avoid staining of the tongue or lips) is enough to give a concentration range of 100-300 nanomolar of methylene blue in the body assuming 5 liters of blood in the average person. At 100 microliter per day doses, there might be very slight discoloring of urine with a tint of green after waking up showing that this may be about the highest effective range to be taking. Even at these doses, methylene blue can cause stomach aches if taken without any sort of food, and may cause drowsiness (at least in me), and effect which is completely countered and overridden by our next item.</lj-cut><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Quercetin""><font size=""14"">Quercetin</font><br /><br /><u>History</u>: They say an &quot;apple a day keeps the doctor away&quot;? The reason for this seems to be quercetin. Quercetin is found at one of its highest natural levels in apples, especially the skin, and is highest in capers. It is a plant derived compound and a member of the bioflavonoid family, and happens to be the most active[<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercetin"">11</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18417116?ordinalpos=2&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">12</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18827577?ordinalpos=5&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">13</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18187018?ordinalpos=4&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">14</a>]. <br /><br /><u>Effects</u>: Quercetin has <b>anti-cancer</b>[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18467024?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">15</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12168845?ordinalpos=3&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">16</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17148506?ordinalpos=4&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">17</a>]<b>, anti-inflammatory</b>[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16522772?ordinalpos=15&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">18</a>]<b>, anti-viral</b>[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12431781?ordinalpos=2&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">19</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18579649?ordinalpos=3&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">20</a>]<b>, anti-histamine</b>[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12504347?ordinalpos=6&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">21</a>]<b>, and anti-oxidant activity</b>[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15691067?ordinalpos=18&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">22</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17936464?ordinalpos=2&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">23</a>]. It also increases mental concentration/focus and alertness, and physical energy by possibly decreasing the rate at which natural levels of adrenaline are lost from the body[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17136942?ordinalpos=3&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">24</a>]. Quercetin increases capillary permeability and increasing the health of tissues, helps maintain artery elasticity and fight atherosclerosis[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17015250?ordinalpos=4&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">25</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10678090?ordinalpos=2&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">26</a>], protects neurons from hypoxia and drug induced necrosis[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18948185?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">27</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17929310?ordinalpos=27&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">28</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18522906?ordinalpos=8&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">29</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17944542?ordinalpos=17&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">30</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17666865?ordinalpos=20&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">31</a>], inhibit mast cells and thus prevent plaques from occurring in arteries, and acts as a Vitamin C sparer - keeping Vitamin C from being processed out of the body too rapidly. Its anti-cancer properties come from its ability to induce apoptosis of only cancerous cells[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18726985?ordinalpos=2&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">32</a>]. 20-100 micromoles of quercetin is enough to kill, in a dose dependent manner, up to 90% of cancerous cells in one go while leaving all non-cancerous cells healthy and alive[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15685239?ordinalpos=3&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">33</a>]. This apparently is done by inhibiting MAPK pathways crucial for cancer propagation, decreasing levels of the protein survivin at the same time as increasing the death proteins caspases[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18971417?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">34</a>], and increasing the cancer watch dog protein p53 - thus priming a malignant cell to self destruct by turning off their ability to override apoptosis, and turning back on the sensors that detect if a cell is bad and start the apoptotic pathways. Most likely it's in this same or similar manner, quercetin acts as an anti-viral. Strangely enough, while quercetin inhibits the aspects of the immune system that causes inflammation and self tissue damage, it also paradoxically increases the effectiveness of the immune system against pathogens of all types, making a person less prone to sickness on all fronts. For instance, quercetin is also an anti-bacterial[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18481022?ordinalpos=4&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">35</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18625009?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">36</a>] It should be noted that quercetin also inhibits one of the major drug metabolic enzyme in the body; therefore, it increases the effective concentration of statin based drugs and this must be kept in mind when taking quercetin.<br /><br />Finally, quercetin apparently increases bone density[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17265531?ordinalpos=3&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">37</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18383168?ordinalpos=5&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">38</a>], fights diabetes[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12927910?ordinalpos=23&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">39</a>], and fights obesity[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18586010?ordinalpos=3&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">40</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18433793?ordinalpos=6&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">41</a>].<br /><br /><u>Availability</u>: Quercetin is cheap and can be found at GNC stores under the anti-oxidant section, and at any &quot;whole foods&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; stores. For instance, I get my quercetin at a store called Wild Oats. There's a lot of gems to be found at such places that aren't part of the usual drudge in a pharmaceutical.<br /><br /><u>Usage</u>: Quercetin is non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, and not a neurotoxin in vivo at all[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18675775?ordinalpos=6&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">42</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16012761?ordinalpos=6&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">43</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17698276?ordinalpos=3&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">44</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18556240?ordinalpos=4&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">45</a>], and it's apparently safe to take even up to 2000 mg per kg body weight per day (though that's way too high). Both its in vitro human neural protective and anti-cancer effects are seen to peak at ranges of 20-100 micromolar, but it shouldn't be taken at doses that'll push its in vivo concentration above 200 micromolar, I&nbsp;feel. There's always the law of diminishing returns, not to mention the inverted U shaped dose response curve - more isn't better once you find the right level. <br />500 milligrams (mg) per day is what I take. Since its absorption rate by ingestion is 20-50%, 500 mg will give about 0.5-1 micromoles of quercetin in the body with a half life of ~16 hours[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8891673?ordinalpos=5&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">46</a>] (1gram per day for 28 days gives about 1.5 micromols in the blood[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9482769?ordinalpos=17&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">47</a>]). Quercetin is absorbed very poorly on its own, but is enhanced when taken with fatty acids, which brings us to our next item.</lj-cut><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Omega Fatty Acids""><font size=""14"">Omega Fatty Acids</font><br /><br /><u>History</u>: Omega fatty acids are mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids. That means, there's a double bond &quot;kink&quot; in the long chain of carbons that makes up the &quot;fatty&quot; part of the acid. They are called &quot;omega&quot; as the numbering convention begins with the final carbon (the omega carbon) of the chain and counting the carbons till the first double bond is reached. There are three types of these fatty acids, linolenic acid (Omega-3), linoleic acid (Omega-6), and oleic acid (Omega-9). All three of these fatty acids are produced by plants and fish to a lesser extent - our bodies, and mammals in general, are incapable of making them, as with the other two molecules listed so far.<br /><br /><u>Effects</u>: How exactly omega fatty acids do what they do is a mystery still, as far as I know. Why they are beneficial is a question of research, but how they are beneficial has been well established. Omega fatty acids help to <b>protect the heart and cardiovascular system from disease, heart attacks, strokes, and atherosclerosis</b>. They also are potent in keeping the brain healthy and functional. These fatty acids most likely do so by inserting into cell membranes to keep the membranes fluid, dynamic, and active - a vital attribute to cell function and whole organ health[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19040594?ordinalpos=5&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">48</a>].<br /><br /><u>Availability</u>: There are two main sources you can find everywhere, including your local grocery store: cod fish oil, and flax seed oil, and both are cheap. Flax seed oil is far more beneficial than cod oil, having a higher concentration of omega fatty acids and much lower concentrations of less beneficial saturated fatty acids, as well as having lignans and other phytochemicals, which also can protect the heart and especially keep arteries elastic.<br /><br /><u>Usage</u>: The national academy of science recommends taking ~1.2 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day, however, there is no known upper limit and the flax seed oil I have has about 4 grams.</lj-cut><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Resveratrol""><font size=""14"">Resveratrol</font><br /><br /><u>History</u>: Here we come to our last breakthrough chemical, and the second most recently discovered, after the new found properties of methylene blue at 100 nanomolar concentrations. Resveratrol (try to say that 10x fast) is a chemical made by grapes and thus commonly found in red wine. It and quercetin are what give low doses of red wine (a glass a day) the beneficial effects that have been seen. Resveratrol is a very interesting molecule.<br /><br /><u>Effects</u>: From yeasts, to worms and flies, to mice, <b>resveratrol intake can increase life span from 20-40%</b>! (70% life span increase if you're a yeast, 16% at most for mice, so it alone likely doesn't increase <em>maximum</em> human lifespan)[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18826454?ordinalpos=5&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">49</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18599363?ordinalpos=133&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">50</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18691046?ordinalpos=7&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">51</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17112576?ordinalpos=8&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">52</a>] Moreover, 400 mg per kg per day doses given to mice <b>doubles</b> the physical endurance and (somewhat) strength of said mice[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17112576?ordinalpos=8&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">52</a>]! Literally, doubles endurance both for mice on restrictive pure health diets (best diet you can get) and those on extremely poor high fat diets (McDonald's every day). Furthermore, mice on 22 mg/kg resveratrol have significantly lower weight when on a high fat diet, than mice without resveratrol, staying much slimmer and closer to the size of perfect diet mice, even while being less active and having a lower resting heart rate[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17086191?ordinalpos=32&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">53</a>].

does this not only by some direct chemical effect as we've seen with the last three, but by increasing the activity of sirtuins[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17112576?ordinalpos=8&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">52</a>]. These proteins are master regulators that keep the gene expression profile of a cell in check. They also act as DNA repair enzymes, being first responders to sites of damage to begin the repair process. Since every cell in our bodies have the entire genome, that is, every cell is completely identical genetically, differences between a neural cell and a heart cell are due fully and only to the patterns of gene expression, which are maintained and overseen by sirtuins. When one ages, sirtuins begin to get overwhelmed by DNA damage that accumulates as mitochondria begin to become dysfunctional and reactive oxygen species production increases. As sirtuin levels are pulled away for damage repair, genes that were silenced begin to come on[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19041753?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">83</a>]. That is, a heart cell might start expressing liver cell genes, and as soon as that happens, badness begins and the effects of aging begin to be seen. Sirtuins can reverse this leakage of supposed to be silenced genes if given the chance. There's where resveratrol comes in, upregulating sirtuin genes and reversing the effects of aging and high fat diets[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17112576?ordinalpos=8&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">52</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18694626?ordinalpos=13&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">84</a>].<br /><br /><u>Availability</u>: I've found this product at the same whole foods store as quercetin. However, it's usually paired, and in low levels of trans-resveratrol, with other grape extracts, so the type I'm taking only has 14mg of trans-resveratrol (equivalent to 1 liter of good red wine, but still very, very low). However, <a href=""http://www.myrevgenetics.com/Micronized-Resveratrol-and-Tween-80-250mg-p/nitro250-caps.htm"">myrevgenetics.com</a> has an amazing combination of 250 mg of resveratrol mixed with tween-80 to give incredibly better absorption, equivalent to 1-3 grams of resveratrol by itself. Now that's the way to go, and I'll use that once I&nbsp;have the money, one day.<br /><br /><u>Usage</u>: This is the interesting part. Remember the super mice with double endurance and much greater strength, yet lower heart rate, weight, and activity needs? Looking back up, we see those mice were ingesting 400 mg/kg/day of resveratrol. This equates, for me, a daily intake of about 3600 mg, again since humans have a slower metabolism. However, since 22 mg/kg/day in mice is all that's necessary for the rest of its good effects, I'd need only ~200-500 mg per day, not bad at all. Also, the mice taking 400 mg/kg/day had constant serum levels of around 100 micromolar. For a human with 5 liters of blood, that requires consuming ~500 mg with only a ~20% absorption rate[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10894555?ordinalpos=25&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">85]</a>, or ~1 gram with 1% absorption rate, but also depends on how long resveratrol remains unprocessed in the system. Resveratrol doesn't seem to have any adverse side effects, for instance, mouse behavior is identical between those on 400 mg/kg of it and those not, aside from the super power of those on it, and no lifespan decrease was seen at an insane dose of 2400 mg/kg[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18599363?ordinalpos=133&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">50</a>]. What the actual lowest limit is to have the effects of resveratrol be apparent, I'm not sure, but again, 500 mg isn't hard to come by and on-line there are 500-1000 mg capsules being sold, and the <a href=""http://www.myrevgenetics.com/Micronized-Resveratrol-and-Tween-80-250mg-p/nitro250-caps.htm"">myrevgenetics.com</a> site has by far the most economical and best solution I've seen. I'm still reading many scientific papers to figure out the lowest limit. However, since red wine, which has only around 14 mg of resveratrol per liter, has significant benefits, doses even 1/100 of the small amount given here may be enough for some benefit if paired with quercetin, which is also in red wine. This is because quercetin increases the span that resveratrol lasts in the system by inhibiting its degradation, thus increasing its effective concentration[<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11055264?ordinalpos=13&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">86</a>,<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11197066?ordinalpos=12&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"">87</a>], not to mention how well the two pair synergistically. Also to note is that trans-resveratrol is the most active form, cis-resveratrol does next to nothing, so always factor that out of total resveratrol concentrations to find the useful amount.</lj-cut><br /><br />There you have it, four super chemicals that may change the face of medicine, and lead to substantially longer and <i>healthier</i> lives. In summary:<br /><br /><b><u>Methylene blue</u></b> - ~300-1000 micrograms (30-100 microliters of 1% solution, so you'll need a syringe or dropper (1 drop is ~50 microliters), or to dilute it more) daily, giving about 100-300 nanomoles in the body, may stop Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, increase life span, stop mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular aging, and reverse cellular senescence.<br /><br /><b><u>Quercetin</u></b> - 500-1000 mg (40 mg in one apple if with skin) daily acts to kill cancer while leaving healthy tissue healthy; kill viruses; enhance the power of the immune system, while acting as an anti-inflammatory/anti-histamine to stop self damage; enhance physical energy and endurance, metal concentration and focus; increase heart and vascular health; protect neurons and cells from necrosis; and act as an anti-oxidant to prevent damage associated with aging.<br /><br /><b><u>Omega Fatty Acids</u></b> - From flax seed oil, 1.2-4 grams daily greatly increases heart, vascular, and brain healthy to reduce heart disease/attacks, hardening of the arteries, and strokes. May have even more beneficial roles.<br /><br /><b><u>Resveratrol</u></b> - 500-3600 mg daily (can be bought anywhere from 500-1000 mg capsules, or 250 mg with tween-80 which is super effectively absorbed, otherwise 500-1000 mg per day is probably enough when paired with quercetin), also found in red grapes/wine. Very powerful anti-aging compound and protector from associated ill effects, as well as metabolism enhancer and protector from the ill effects of a high fat diet (in mouse studies it grants the same health as if on a perfect diet). Increases physical power by double at highest listed dose, in mice, but a person should stay around 200-500 mg with quercetin. Some anti-cancer and radiation protective effects, bone and joint protection, heart and vascular protection, and neurological protection.<br /><br />All of these except methylene blue are available over the counter at pharmacies and &quot;natural/whole&quot; food stores. Methylene blue is available over the counter at science/hobby stores, and some pharmacies in certain places (Walgreen's in Florida).<br /><br />Note, this is a rough guide, and anything one ingests they do so at their own risk :P. But I'm taking the first three at the levels recommended here already, and have experienced marked benefits - especially from quercetin which has greatly increased my daily energy level, in that I don't feel nearly as tired as I always did before. Methylene blue and omega-3s are more passive, the effects they give you can't be seen till later in life by you <i>not</i> getting sick and suffering horrible effects of aging and associated diseases like Alzheimer's and heart disease. Although, methylene blue and omega fatty acid effects also can manifest in better skin health/glow and faster nail growth, all signs of happy cells. Resveratrol is also mostly passive if one is already healthy, however it does increase cold resistance I've discovered, quite well too!<br /><br />I also don't take anything on the weekend, giving my body time to detox and reset to normal - which may or may not be important, who knows; but I feel it's quite important, to avoid desensitization and any unknown chronic effects, and I tend to think our natural levels are important to keep around, in a holistic sense.<br /><br />Ah science.. who knows what we'll find next - but considering these compound (aside from methylene blue, which was a total shock) all come from natural sources that were known to give remarkable health benefits (apple a day...), I guess it is one of those &quot;about time&quot; sort of things, haha; dunno how many more may be out there, if any other major ones like these four."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Ho hum"">Well... the oral defense mock grant things is not going well, not going well at all. I've made next to no progress since my last post over a month ago. I have plenty of new sources to read.. so I'll spend today doing that as I switch to a totally new topic, which will hopefully be fruitful. I just can't come up with a satisfying idea. We can't write about our own research stuff, or it would be mildly easy; I have to make it about something afield from me and only vaguely similar in approach and idea. My PI wanted me to get an abstract done two weeks ago, but this is just not.. working out at all. Maybe my brain has just needed a break... but a month of no progress is way bloody more than enough.

Lab work is also spinning in the mud. I have four or five projects going at once, and none of them are really going anywhere per ce, despite doing tons of work each day. I get so close and then suddenly things don't work. Sure, that's the way science is, but it's frustrating, and I feel such a weight on my shoulders to perform outstandingly instead of just bare mediocrity since I was nominated for and received this $5,000 dollar Dean's Doctoral Graduate Fellowship out of the blue. Only one person per department or whatever is selected, so it's a pretty big honor. And now I don't feel like I'm living up to it in the least. I don't know if it goes to me or the lab, probably the lab, but still! People say I deserve it, and then I look at the fact I haven't made any progress, or so it feels to me, in the past month and it gets kinda depressing.

And my computer is still dead, as all the replacement parts I get for it alternate in being defective, so I have to RMA them to get my money back and try again and again... Gwahh, gotta RMA this latest motherboard now too. It's actually kinda funny, but annoying.</lj-cut>

I should probably talk about happier things.. Oh! Blue's visit was amazing! Muchly incredible and fun. Seeing him go stunk, and I miss him quite a bit. And all the Teal'c say, ""Indeeeed.""

Be nice to have a friend around here again once Rynn gets in on the same day Rachel is flying back from Oklahoma where she and everyone else on her father's living will are trying to decide what to do with him now that his SCA is really getting bad (I suspect the medications for it are what are causing him the most trouble as SCA should only affect his motor skills, not his lucidity and consciousness). What else... got a new fridge after our last one pooped out, this one is much bigger and more awesome. I guess that's pretty much it. Time to go back to neglecting this place XD."

"event","<lj-cut text=""science rants, yay"">There was a science article released today, actually released four days ago, but took that time to trickle through the system to where I caught it, about a very unusual pulsar that ""surprised"" scientists. In and of itself, nothing noteworthy, but the discussions about it, revolving around science and how it is perceived, are indeed noteworthy. A large portion of the general populous does not understand what science <i>is</i>. This is a problem that's been known for a long time, and has probably always been around, but it seems to be compounding and changing nature as technology grows. For the common man these days, people act like anything that surprises scientists must threaten the very fabric of space and time.

That is a problem, a huge problem, with perception. It stems from a view that whatever scientists say, whatever models they have, <b>must</b> be immutable and the universe <b>must</b> act according to them. A highly arrogant position that even some scientists slip into that isn't arrogance when born from ignorance, of course, but which pervades our current culture.

Science, with its math and models, is simply a type of <i>language</i>. Just like English is a language, science is the language and description of observation. Math is a human invented quantative language, but a language no less. The scientific method is only a standardized means to ensure that what a scientist is discribing is what the scientist is actually observing--quality control. The quantative language of math allows us to communicate in objective and reproducible terms. But none of this changes the fact that all we are doing is <i>observing</i> reality. We are not writing reality, but relating to ourselves and one another what we have seen through science, and then predicting what we <i>expect</i> to see next if we change a few variables or look at some new ones, via models. That's it, that's all it is, observation of reality. The world will do whatever it darn well pleases, we merely tell one another what we've seen of its operation and call that telling ""science""!

So, you can see a very profound and fundamental problem arises when people begin to act and treat scientific observations as immutable laws. They aren't. Everything in science is 100% subject to revision, if any observations change in reproducible ways. The earth is round. No it isn't, it's oblong--that's revision, that's science. If the laws of physics decide to change tomorrow and turn the world into a flat two dimensional plane, then if anyone is alive in a form to observe that change, they'll record it, revise our understandings, and science will go on. It's nothing incredible, nothing mystical, nothing esoteric. Yet people treat science as if it's the ""Word of God"". This is a terrible error, and thus every other day some new observation is made which ""shocks"" everyone (and which shouldn't!), or the media calls it a ""breakthrough"". Just observation, we watch how the world works, but it does its own thing. It seems so obvious, yet the mob mentality just doesn't get it.

This then leads to a whole other issue, something I discussed with a recent associate. He was saying that the universe acts like dominoes, that one thing happens and that leads to the next thing always the same, that there's no random of any sort, only cause and effect. Now, in the nice Newtonian view of the world, this is only <i>mostly</i> correct (in a pure, simulated mathematical sense it is, but actual experimentally observation shows it isn't). Throw in quantum mechanics and it's totally off. Why? It sounds so nice. I once believed like that--but it's absolutely wrong, and provably so.

The world runs on probabilities. There is always variance. No matter how controlled the environment, no matter what the experiment, every time something is done twice you get a different result. No result, what so ever, at no time, is 100% reproducible. This is why science is always expressed in statistics (something else which is lost on the population). There is always, always variance. Now, variance in an experiment where we observe and learn something about how the universe works is very low, that is, not statistically high enough to break our ""one population under observation"" rule, so we can derive concrete, reproducible experiments. Reproducible means the <i>MEAN</i> (aka average) is reproducible, never the exact results. So, even if you do a Newtonian experiment, even if you hit two balls together more than once, the results, the distances, the arcs, everything will always be slightly different, no matter how perfectly controlled the experiment is. This small level of variance is normal, when we are observing something new, that's when the variance between older data and the newer data grows to be statistically significant. That's how we know and show we have a ""different population"", a ""different mean"" and thus a ""different system"" under study.

Yes, the stock market isn't strictly random: it is run on probabilities. If one stock goes up, you know the probability of another going up and down, and the more that one stock goes up, the probabilities of the other changing changes in accordance. But it's still probability. Even if it's 80% chance it'll happen, there's still a 20% chance it won't, and sometimes it just doesn't happen even when we fully expect it should. Yay, probability, variance.

If you flip a coin, the position of your finger already determines if it'll be heads or tails before it lands. No, it only tells you how probable it'll be heads or tails before it lands.

Probability is only the result of not knowing enough variables. Prove that. It can't be done. Because even in super colliders there's variance, and that variance is more than simply machine variances added together. Always there is variance, and then even in our detectors, in our machines, there is variance. Never can you escape it. Via Occam's Razor, it only makes sense to view the world as being run by probability. When viewed that way <i>everything</i> falls into place, from the stock market to the beating of a heart, and you now have predictive power with a versatility you lacked under the ""domino"" view. So, the Newtonian view of if you know enough variables you can predict the outcome to any event is false. But you can know the ""general"" or probable outcome to within a certain degree of error--this is where people get hitched and confused. You can, because variance has a characteristic size within a given population, predict the ""general"" results if you know enough variables acting on a system and how they interrelate and interact with that system. But you can never predict the exact result, because it isn't a ""domino"" run universe, it's a probability run one--so far as we've observed and which we can experimentally show.

And then you throw in quantum mechanics and all of this makes even more sense. There is a world which runs strictly on probabilities. And worst yet for those ""domino"" viewists, [i]it works[/i]. And works all too well. Already we even have working quantum computers. Even the orbits of the planets are only explained via quantum mechanics, via probability, not by Newtonian views.

If it wasn't for the fact it's been observed to be how the universe runs--if it wasn't for the fact it works, I'd still strictly believe in the Newtonian world view. And really the population is still taught in that sort of way, loosely, since science education to begin with is so poor! But that isn't how it goes. If a domino falls and hits another, maybe there's only a 90% chance that other will fall, and when that one strikes the next in the line there may only be a 89% chance that one will fall. THAT is how the universe has been observed to work at every single level. So if the nth domino in the line falls or not depends on the sum of the probabilities of all those fallen dominoes from before. Again this is observibly true: the butterfly effect is not real. If a butterfly flaps its wings, it doesn't cause a hurricane because the system is inherently buffered. That is, over iterations and time a cause slowly gets washed out and can no longer contribute to an effect. By the nth time, after enough times, the probability goes to 0.

So then, the interaction of some atoms at the beginning of time no longer has any bearing now. That cause was swallowed up, diluted away, and is no longer apart of the events of now--the dominoes stopped falling.

Then one can say ""But we've always seen objects fall towards the Earth. If it was all probability, isn't there a probability that it may fall up one day?"" Yes, obviously. From the quantum view that's pretty obvious. But the probability is so vanishingly low, the number of times things must be dropped just to get a case where one doesn't drop quite as fast, let alone the wrong direction for any length of time, is basically infinite. But it isn't completely infinite. We can't test a system as big as an apple, but we can test smaller systems, like atoms and molecules or light, and indeed, they don't always get affected by gravity and fall down 100% of the time: just <i>most</i> of the time, and that's all that's needed to give us our mean, our general result, and our macro observed common experience.

This is not to say the world <i>only</i> works via probabilities, which cannot be proved absolutely, and isn't observably true so far. But the vast majority of the observed universe does. There are some seemingly immutable laws: conservation of mass and energy, conservation of momentum, the laws of thermal dynamics. These laws form a framework within which probabilities exist, as they couldn't exist otherwise. So even if probabilities run most things, there has to still be a framework to make sense of them in. Then again, if we suddenly do see an instance where one of those laws fail due to some probabilistic event, I wouldn't be surprised, and nor should scientists. Instead, we should observe, describe, and refine our models to incorporate the new information--an act which is the heart and soul of science.</lj-cut>"

"event","Whoa man, I guess I should post in here, seeing as it's a whole new year and stuffz.

It's amazing how fast things change in the mental realm when you are some place that is conducive to your growth. It also makes me realize how lacking in ways ones early education is. It's like the difference between two scientific papers I had to compare/contrast for a homework assignment recently. One wasn't that well written, and the other was good. But it wasn't something easily quantified. It was little things that built up to make the whole experience what it was. Such minor details can swamp out the majority of the paper and decide it's appeal. The same goes for most things in life it appears, even education. There are certain things that seem minor, but when stacked together are so abundantly important.

I've grown so much since undergrad. And yet, it's once again in those little things.

It's a little sad though that I find it hard to get the want to write anything here. It isn't an unwillingness to do so, or the want to not do so, it's just the act of not doing it. The same goes for me talking to people on-line lately. I love talking with my friends, but for some reason I just am not. There are some people who are definite exceptions, but nonetheless. It's kinda like how I feel about my homework right now. I want to do it, and yet I find it hard to do it. Bah, I need to, and that need outweighs anything else.

In less introspective things, life is going great at the moment. I am hoping that the IRS gets finished setting up its new ARM processing system soon so I can get my refund check. Switched back to cable and digital phone, so that means a new phone number. Now that ADT has worked out the bugs of the digital system, it's all good; on top of that, it's 20 bucks less than AT&T, and that's before the AT&T rate hike has hit.

Ok, back to homework."

"event","So, I'm going to be a minor author on a scientific paper that's being sent for submission soon. :D Afterall, I did help write the materials and methods and some data of mine will be presented. It's so awesome. Yeah, sure, <i>minor</i> author, but it's the first time my name will ever appear on a scientific, peer reviewed article. I'm stoked. And of course it should be extra bonus points for my applications for fellowships. Also, I may be writing a text book chapter with my PI; but it depends on if he decides it is worth our effort, will have a wide enough circulation, and/or won't be too big a tangent from our main focus in lab. It'd certainly help me learn every little detail about my protein of study, so really it would practically cause me to write out my dissertation in part right there and then. It'd be in March, so we'll see.

Got snow here yesterday, and the skies have this oppressive ""GOING TO BLIZZARD U!"" look to them. Also got a stray dog two days ago. Two puppies, but our dogs ran off one before we got the other. It's a pit mixed with something else random. In any case, we took it in to keep it safe and see if we would find an owner looking around, but that didn't happen, and since I don't think it would be a wise idea to put up fliers at this point in time for several reasons, we shall take it to the animal shelter tomorrow (where I would look first anyways if I lost an animal). There is a very good one here in the city that should take good care of it, and it'll find a home soon with as cute as it is (part of why I need to get rid of it soon, attachments are growing fast lol, but we can't keep it). I don't think it ever had an owner actually, as it had no collar or evidence of ever having one; and another stray dog, DEFINITELY stray dog, has been romping around here howling, because this little pup of ours is a female and it wants to make puppies with her. Even though she's probably immature; she's just a very big puppy, very big unfixed puppy. I have no idea where they come from, or how they survive, but it seems the city has a little sub population of these dogs.

Finals are here. Monday and Tuesday. The Monday virology test I don't worry about, though of course need to thoroughly study for. It's the prokaryotic molecular test I really really worry about. Ungodly amounts of information, and last test wiped the floor with me despite preparing for it more than the first test (which I did just ok on). I need to get an A so I can get my 4.0, or at least closer to one. *shakes fist* Darn bacteria.. why aren't you as cool as viruses? So yes, enough prattle here, I need to work like mad.

Oh, I shall be going off Dec 17-30th, both to Oklahoma and then to Washington State and my family. Wee, time flies so fast."

"event","<lj-cut text=""How will rapidly evolving technology change our present, our future?"">I love reading about and learning about technology. It's workings, pros and cons. Technology of all sorts from computer hardware to hydrogen fuel cells, cars, nuclear reactors, anything. I suppose it's also in part because my thirst for knowledge and understanding has exploded to insatiable levels. I guess that's the price of activating that sort of part of the self by becoming a scientist lol.

But one thing I've watched is how much technology has EXPLODED. In only a century the world has changed in ways that we can't even appreciate. But the fact of the matter is that technological advancement is snowballing. There's no surprise there; but we are starting to move so fast we don't have time to think and even begin to ponder on the ramifications, both for the future and society as it is even now. Technology is rabidly snapped up with every passing day. But what does it do to us? Are we blind, can we even see? Are there consequences yet? 1/4 people ages 16-24 responded on a recent survey that was in the news that the internet would work as a substitute for a significant other. Just stop and think for a moment; a decade ago people would sit around watching TV, but they'd still be oft to do things like reading and all sorts of physically oriented activities. Now with computers, that's rapidly sliding to mentally based activities. 80% of adults in this country now use the internet regularly is another recent survey, up from the 40% just a few years ago.

Now, this interchange and flow of ideas has already started to reform society. We don't actively see it, as we are so obsessed with what's forward we don't see the now or past. Even the older generations are now starting to snatch up technology as the bug that is on my youth and self has finally migrated to them. How can you not though? It's so easy to get absorbed.

In the 50s there were a lot of dreams. Men thought and dreamed big. But they couldn't make those dreams a reality as technological manufacturing bases weren't there. They are now. Now, we are moving faster than we can dream or think of what to use our new inventions for. Reading tech and biology news leaves a person aghast at all the potential cures for this and that, potential technologies for insane amounts of things, that are developed seemingly daily but don't get carried past that initial reality as there's just too many new things to sort though that there's no time to see what everything could be used for. Let alone what is best. Of course, things are always still moving forward, but it's amazing tempest of idea progressions. The dreams of the 50s are reality now, and so much more. Laser weapons, cold fusion, mind controlled prosthetics and cybernetics, nanotechnology, hydrogen fuel cells (which the first production car has finally been released; new home based hydrogen generators that run off of natural gas let anyone fuel up at home and power their house; and a new way to mass make hydrogen using bacteria for a 288% energy return more than what goes into it using waste and trash holds the promise to totally revolutionize the energy domain if people will allow the change), laser based and ion based space propulsion, humanoid like robots, robotic fighting tanks, quantum computers which are finally starting to function, cell phones (which are indeed a revolutionizing technology that few really stops to think about), and so so much more. All within the last few years! All since the new millennium! Sure the roots of everything go way back, but this burst of technological harvest is radical. But even more radical is not that things have finally come to fruition, but that the leap to new tech has allowed another leap to even higher technology at a mere fraction of the time the past leap took. That's where the real wonder lies. Each massive leap is now happening so much faster it's becoming a blur. A technological singularity... with all the new batteries, nanogenerators, and such, the only thing really holding us back is our willingness to adopt new technology and change.

I do not have the frame of reference with which to even speculate on what this will do to our future. Science fiction has always been so good at showing us possibilities and what to avoid; but even that is limited to imagination and the world always moves in ways no one ever imagined or anticipated. So then, it's silly to try in a way, though so wise if one can and prepare for or guide that change. I still remember before computers. I still remember before the internet. I still remember writing reports by hand. I still remember being told and shown how to use a type writer and being told I'd have to master it if I was to succeed in life. When there were no cell phones and cordless phones were the brand new ""wow"" thing. I still remember two big macs being only a buck. Not each, but both at once. Sure, every single generation sees massive change; but the scale, scope, speed, and pervasiveness of the changes we are seeing now are unprecedented. Surely so similar when reduced to the core as things the romans once saw during their hay day, but none the less.

We, the developed world, only make up a small percentage of the full world. But... the technology we have now has filtered down to the third world. In reality, it's all of humanity that's now rapidly changing. What will be the end of this? As I said, it's silly to wonder, yet wise at the same time. Foolish is it to blindly race into the unknown, but foolish is it to worry into stagnation or stall because of possibilities. Ohhhh, what a balance. Still, just looking at how fast computers are evolving in just the past three years and it leaves one feeling queasy. Too fast! We don't even develop technology like DDR or CPU architectures to their fullest before we abandon them for something totally new--we don't even start to. In a way it's good and oh so great, but in another way it's a problem.

Obviously, all this is just an outgrowth of the way people are. There is nothing humans can do that isn't part of them in one way or another; or imparted to them by Grace if it's good things. But, everything affects everything else at some level; and even if these things are extensions of the way we are deep inside, they still change that too. They change the name of the game. I can't even imagine the type of people the children of my generation will be... or what affects all of this technological exploding will have on their world view, morality, and such. Will the knew generations be able to effect this rapid change in their times? Will they even be able to maintain all this new technology we are making? Will they understand the realities of engineering, science, and good work ethics? Or will they lose their sense of reality in the imaginary existence of the digital which only exists in our minds? Sure you can say the internet and such things are real, but their reality, importance, and existence are solely molded by humanity and therefore only as important as we want them to be mentally--they are not real like trees, mountains, and rivers. Yet, on the flip side, maybe the new generations will have an even better understanding of what is needed--maybe the platform of technology will enable them to do so much more. Maybe they'll realize from all their blessings what's needed to make things work, and realize how important it is to protect and enhance our habitats. Maybe.

In any case, this sure is a thrill ride. So much is happening in our world now, and so very little of it is actually good. As human technology grows, nature seems to be dying, and fast. 80% of common bird species, honey bees, bumble bees, and most mammals are now disappeared or disappearing.</lj-cut>

On the other side of things, I'm applying to fellowships. I need to find more, but so far I've got two, one with a very very good chance one with a very low chance but the biggest pay off of all. Pray I get that latter one with the Department of Defense.

In even other news, me and Andrew have been successful in pulling power out of our energy device above baseline! Momentous! We just need to optimize. We know our method is not the best due to some recent and startling observations. Friggin A, I don't have the resources to even try to experiment on the physics behind these phenomena, I can only harvest them for now till I do and can finally analyze and get a firmer foundation. So few scientific papers out there on these subjects, but I need to look up more and synthesize all of it together as much as possible. It's just so complex for everyone. If we can perfect this and figure out how to get higher yields... then it'll be yet another but hopefully most revolutionary alternative energy source. Heck, it could lead to the penultimate in power sources... I just can't say what or it'll give too much away on the nature of what we're working on ;). So many more experiments to run. Too bad I'm being lazy lately and playing games, haha!

"event","<lj-cut text=""financial annoyances"">Financial things are kicking my arse this month. A year and two months here, with trials and tribulations, but by Grace I always got through fine each month; if only by the skin of my teeth, makes no difference. This month has just been bloody atrocious. I went in with extra, got some awesome and incredible help from my parents, and yet I've hit the bottom of the barrel. I always keep track of all my finacial stuff, and I always round up on my expenses, making it effectively as if I have less than I do. But I miscalculated this one time: I over looked that my homeowners insurance decided that my house was worth more than it is. They said they ""inspected it"" which is a load of bollucks, and then upped the rate. I can't really fault them, cause if anything happened they'd pay me out even more than ever. However, any upped rate equals me having to pay out of my pocket, and it was nearly 150 extra. Added to the huge 222 dollar electric bill (which will not be anywhere near that again for another year, but the gas bill will get up there at its climax) and the fact I'm being billed twice by them in the same pay period (another 88 for this month).. Just lots and lots of ow.

Sufficing to say, I need prayer. God has always provided for me, be it the last moment or not, He always has and quite amazingly and stunningly too; so I am not worried about that as I know either way will be worked to my good. I'm just more frustrated and annoyed this time because I wouldn't be in any difficult spot at all if.. if the Financial Aid office would do it's job :|.

I talked to them again just Wednesday and got the infamous ""It'll be done in two weeks!"" that they've given us for two MONTHS. That is, of course, after five minutes of having to explain to them WHAT a fee waiver even was and that, yes, I did PHYSICALLY hand it in to them in AUGUST. URG. Why the heck did this get given to the Financial Aid office? The cashier's office would have it done and posted the next friggin day or at least within the same week. I just can't believe all this. At least the poor student at the counter went back and verified that my waiver was there in the stack of them. What's even worst, is that the Chem department people's waivers have all been finished for quite a long time now--so what's the hold up with our's?!

So, I went to the dean and explained the situation, and the fact that everyone else is stuck like me. So, he's going to do some digging and get on whomever's arse he needs to to get this issue resolved.</lj-cut>

Anyways, finished writing my seminar : D. Now I just need to rehearse it like mad, haha. But it feels great already to have this mostly off my shoulders.

We met with our collaborators too on Friday (me and my PI and lab I mean). Got some very interesting results on their end that our end fits into nicely. This means the direction for my Dissertation is becoming more clear than ever. There's now a lot to do and study. Still, so much resides with me and getting the protein in large amounts, which hopefully will work out now that I have virus being produced (with any luck X3). After the virology test on Thursday, I'll finally kick back and take a needed break.

Trying to collect it all into a cohesive whole; I just need to keep my will power up long enough to really work at it, a problem that seems exasperated by the fact all will power dissolves as soon as I get home and sit down. This weekend things must get done--and then of course study for my test a week from today. And mow the lawn. Yes... the poor poor lawn.

I really haven't been posting here much, but it is very refreshing to let my thoughts finally escape my head instead of stuffing them away like some poor man into a cubical. The ironic thing is, more is happening now than ever, yet I write less. I suppose that relationship makes sense when viewed from the angle that more to do means less time to type.

I've been greatly pleased though to find my memory capacity improving by bounds as of late. I need to refocus on improving it again, as such improvements only make me realize how much I can benefit from it. A good memory does wonders. Especially when there's so many facets to my research I must juggle at once. And, I am now supervising the work of an undergraduate; which is very fun, since the guy is awesome and quickly learning though still far from being able to work without me there. Regrettably, me, him, and the lab post doc have a horrible disease where when we are in the same room as each other, we suddenly experience a breakdown of all will to do anything but talk about totally inane and random stuff. The worst part is... it's enjoyable so we only want to do it more D:

Gah, I should be reading and trying to perfect my outline. Dern sleep deprivation.
Oh, still no vast remainder of my school loan. At least I'm not alone. Who in their right minds decided it was a good idea to give the Financial Aid office control over tuition/fee wavers when really they are a method of payment (the department does the paying)? Now everyone is waiting for their promised waivers while late fees incorrectly accrue (I'm sure they'll be lifted once the problem is finished). I guess I'm being too hard on them; but their estimate of fixing it by mid September sure was off."

I guess it'll come this Monday or Tuesday, so they say after I talked to them in person, but I was expected they'd be more prompt, since they say they will otherwise. As in, before classes start, they said it'd be distributed, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised, though they had all friggin summer to deal with this. I'm just glad they are punctual about my paycheck! And unfotunately, I desperately need this loan, due to that sewer line trouble we had a while back. It HAS to be dug back up and replaced, no if, ands, or buts about it. Otherwise, the sewer line will eventually be totally blocked off, and.. well... yeeeaaaaahhh, we know what that means. My basement already knows what that means.

And that's not even to say the cost of books and stuff which are outside of my budget range (science books are near 150 a pop). My budget is enough that I can survive on what little events happen and the every day needs. But 5k events are way outside of my league. Too bad the whole new computer system they put in for the school screwed everything up, so my grades were never posted up till it was too late to apply for scholarships.

And, since the loan is not here yet, I can't park on campus come Monday XD;. It'll be interesting, but it should all resolve rather rapidly. Once it's finished, then I'll be able to move ahead. Hopefully it'll come tomorrow and save me prolonged awkwardness.

Still, I worry a lot, and probably won't stop till its fully able to move around like the young spunky iggy it should be.

I've wanted an iguana for a very long time. Now the first one I get is on death's door. Pray for it if you will, it needs it badly. It certainly is beautiful too, with many blue hues--even a blue then brown rainbow like strip under its arm on either side. A seriously beautiful iguana. And if it survives this, it'll either love us forever, or be out to kill us every night for the trauma it's going through lol. I wouldn't mind that, as long as it lives.

Well, in other stuff, I'm working on a project of my own design now, though it's the same goal and overall system as I had been working on before. It's just so nice to have the freedom to make your own attempt. So far so good, we'll see what comes. Come what may.

Edit: Well, the poor little tike died. I'm just glad we were with her when it happened. Her, soaking away in some nice warm water, being watched over and gently stroked. She just stretched, shook from head to tail, then went limp. Ahhh, I was really hoping she was pulling out. She had been fighting us this time when we tried to feed her. I guess her system just couldn't take it at all. I knew things were in trouble when she threw up her last meal during the first part of the soak (before we fed her and the soaked her again which is when she died). If she couldn't hold down her food.. then there wasn't much hope. But she had actually kept her eyes open and tried to put up a fight.. totally got my hopes up. Poor thing. It isn't a surprise at all, and we all knew, the vet and us, that her chances were basically zero. Still had to give it our all, and at least she lived a lot longer than she would have and died in comfort and not alone somewhere were no one would notice for hours. I noticed bubbles coming out of her mouth this time when she was breathing at times, and she had been sneezing since we've had her, rarely, but still. It most likely was a combination of factors, but she was obviously very and deathly ill, and we just didn't buy her soon enough to save her life.

I tried to give her iggy CPR (yes, there is a proper way to give iggies CPR). But, it felt like one of her ribs broke loose. Her bones were so brittle! She probably had metabolic bone defficiency, which probably allowed the infection which worked together to kill her. And what about the lump in her on the right side? The poor tike had at least three deadly problems going on at once. It's a miracle alone that she lasted as long as she did, and to where we were with her.

We'll take her body back to the pet shop tomorrow, and trade for a new one. Go for a calm one that isn't freaking out, but actually of good color. The vet told us what to look for (and poor Rio had all the signs of a dying iguana, we just didn't know): an iguana that is holding itself up, and is a vibrate and not dark green.

Ahh, it's really sad. I was really really pulling for that little baby--even against all the odds. But I knew she wasn't going to make it.. though I hoped. I just am glad she got some peace, rest, and love (even for a short time), and that she made it long enough for me to get home and be with her in the end. I think she kinda knew she was not going to make it, and she gave me the oddest look. And her head kept listing to the side.. she was so ill and fail. Ok, I'll stop going on about it now.

Edit2: Oh, and in the pet store's defense, the vet said whatever was wrong with her was wrong with her for a long time, probably even before they got her. If it was an impaction, which would explain a lot, maybe even her sickness, then there would be no hope outside of opperation, and she was already past the point where there was any hope that would work."

First lesson from biology: 95% of the time nothing will work. 4% of the time, it'll work just enough for you to shrug and get by. 0.999% of the time, it'll work out brilliantly. Finally, 0.001% of the time you'll discover something incredible. Of course, you can still discover something incredible within the 95% failure rate, so really it's more of a 0.002%.

Now that I'm working on my Ph.D. thesis directly, kinda, I get to collaborate with KUMC. It'll be interesting to have to drive all the way over there and back again just to grow some insect cells. I hope the post doc there will give me a hand, as otherwise it'll be a real drag--but he's a really nice fellow and I think he'll be a great and much needed help. Hopefully we'll be able to accomplish what no one has been able to do in 15 years. Oooh boy, this'll be interesting.

Well, anyways, despite how interesting this will be, things are moving along nicely. I've almost owned this house for a whole year, quite remarkable XD.

I've been burying myself in reading as of late, and memory exercises. I realize how inadequate my abilities feel compared to the challenges on hand and the dreams I have and wish to fulfill. Nothing too difficult to overcome I hope, and certainly nothing worth worrying about.

My thoughts are horribly uncollected at the moment. For some reason I feel like I got ran over by a truck. In my head anyways, my body is great, thanks. I guess it's due to being reactionary to some authoritive guy on a tech site forum making the claim that cockroaches and humans are 99% identical DNA wise. Well, poetic license or not, some people will believe him just because he's him XD. The whole argument devolved down into stupid on both our parts, totally unrelated to his original comments. I guess I always feel bad when I get sucked into meaningless drivel so easily. It's a tech site, and doesn't matter, and it doesn't matter how similar us and roaches would be compared to some hypothetical extraterrestrial life form. They didn't put those roaches on that darn biglow inflatable space ship for any other reason than to giggle! GIGGLE! LIKE LITTLE SCHOOL GIRLS!

*cough*

Been kinda nostalgic for old things and people lately. I shall chalk that up to the march of time. There are some people I'll probably never stop missing. As a wise friend of mine put it, ""love never leaves us"" even if it changes forms, or levels, or flavors, or whatever else someone wants to call it."

"event","Sooo, we found out what was exploding so violently awhile back. Seems it was transformers o.o. The end of the street lost power, we were told, or something like that. Fortunately we were spared the outages due to exploding electromagnets. Crazy things. The funny thing is, is that they replaced all the transformers immediately around us with brand new, bigger, badder, awesome-er ones during the winter. Hope those ones that popped were still under warrenty (probably were made in China, since many things from there are being defective or poisoness as of late, like pet food and toothpaste).

Yesterday, right after I left to school, Rachel caught people stealing all the copper piping from the vacant house next door (our neighbors moved last month). She got a huge thank you from the police and the senior vice president of Union Bank who now owned the house (which apparently foreclosed and seems to be why the neighbors had to move then, though they were only renters). My friends, let me tell you something. There are few deeds as idiotic, arse backwards, and plainly absolutely stupid as trying to steal copper piping. Everyone does realize how much WORK would go into ripping up the house, sawing the copper, and then lugging it around? Seriously. And everyone does realize that copper is worth only a little more than DIRT? For half the energy they put into what they did, they could have made an uncomparibly larger sum of money holding a real job at, yes even, McDonnalds! I mean, gees! Out of all the illegal activities one can do, that has to be one of the dumbest I've ever heard of. ""Yes, let us waste all our energy trying to steal what is next to worthless! Oh, and now we get to go to jail and have to pay for all the thousands of dollars in damages we did to the house trying to get the 2 cent worth materials out. HAHAHA, we are SMART!"". Oh man.. thinking about it makes me want to stab my brain so it isn't infected with the same irrationality...

However, the event also brings up alot of strange questions. Sure, we didn't hear all the hammering and sawing that the neighbors on the other side of that house heard since we are flooded with the noise of fans (and PSO *cough*) up here. But, we do take the dogs out every 3 hours or so. And, apparently they had been working for awhile, and we had been taking the dogs out at 1am before this past Monday when I went back to the lab and could no longer stay up so late. How the heck did they almost pull things off under our noses? They may be dumber than defective bricks, but they sure knew how to slink (except when actually trying to remove the copper pipes to a waiting car). I had a weird feeling things were going on in that house a week ago when I noticed a door inside was open. Still... if we had let out the dogs when they were outside.. heh, there would have been alot of blood, and it wouldn't have been the big dog's. So, I'm glad, and they should be glad, that that didn't happen. Still, I am supre glad justice is served in this and such foolishness did not go unpunished. Hopefully they'll learn their lesson!

A final thing to note was that today when we were clearing out all the trees around the sides of that house, as we asked the bank permission to do so and they emphatically told us we could, so that they wouldn't destroy the foundation, we could find no entry point. The only broken glass that was around was behind steel bars you couldn't even get through. Then again, the bank did secure the place again, so maybe they put those bars there after they had been removed? It seems the only plausible explanation unless the people had.. dun dun dun.. a key! And it was an inside job... *looks the way of the old neighbors*. Man, breaking the law is just as moronic as you can get (unless it's an evil law, but laws against stealing are anything but). I wonder how they would feel if someone broke into their house right now while they sit in jail and ripped up the place to steal all the copper? Bet they would feel pretty bad, eh. Ok ok, I shouldn't mock them, so I'll stop now.

In other news... the planet is getting in worst and worst shape. http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/science/06/14/bird.decline/index.html These numbers are ASTOUNDINGLY bad. Not to mention there have been mass die off of birds in individual towns in Texas (and Australia if I remember right) for still unknown reasons. Also, honey bees across the entire globe are rapidly disappearing. Yes, disappearing, without a single dead body anywhere to be found. They are calling it Colony Colapse Disorder, and it bodes very badly for the agriculture of the country and the world (since some crops are primarily pollinated by honey bees alone such as Apples, Oranges, and many different fruits). The CNN article about the birds is really bad in its speculation of the cause, as the forestation of the United States and Europe has vastly increased in the past 60 or so years, before even this die off started. What is the cause of it? I don't know, but things like Ethanol is brand new, and this die off started at least forty years ago, so that explanation is aboslutely bogus. In short, there is no explanation they can give; and I can't even speculate either. The climate hasn't changed that much at all. Whatever it is is probably linked with the mass, unexplained bird die offs happening lately (it isn't from bird flu either, which is why they can't figure it out). You know things are getting really bad when the common species are rapidly perishing. And this on the heels of a EU report about the rapid decay of most of the species on this planet. 

*Shakes head* Pollution outputs are lower than ever (in this country, and world wide compared to the industrial revelution), besides CO2 (which the plants must be loving) and car based pollutants; global temperatures have NOT changed that much as much as the media wants to make it sound like it has (by reporting and emphasizing things they totally ignored and didn't care about five years earlier). Infact, we're still, or have just, coming out of a mini ice age that gripped Europe during the 40's through 60's. Not to mention CO2 levels are 2,000 times lower than in the Devonian period of history which also saw the greatest abundance of life ever on the planet.

The Birds and the Bees... fading away... along with all creatures great and small... Who knows what this will mean in the years to come, but things aren't looking good. I'm sure if humanity collectively put energy and effort into helping the planet, it could easily be restored and made far better than ever. Heck, it's our God given jobs to help and tend and care for the planet, which humanity has abandoned for fleeting, ephemiral things like wealth and profit and toys! This is what we get for our negligence. Our way of life cannot continue forever, and it doesn't look like it will at this rate of species and habitat loss.

I guess as a biologist this really bothers me. I know some ecology, and when 82% of one of your common species is disappearing at a break neck pace along with the others (40 years is blindingly fast on ecological scales), that can only be a harbinger of much worst to come. How blind we've been... if only visionaries like Theodore Roosevelt were listened to. With all the problems beseiging the world and our local civilization.. I don't know how we can persist for another 20 or 40 years. But, humans are crafty, so you can never make such predictions with even a semblance of seriousness. I'm just worried and rightfully so. The planet is crying under the weight of humanity. How long before we slip and fall?"

It is rather disconcerting, and sounds oddly like a morter.

I'll try to get GRUB as the default loader using the Ubuntu CD, and or just delete the load string for xp (Which is more dangerous, but I figure I can just repair it from the windows CD if it does blow it up).

I also got Tor running. Originally I had it running, but not actually set up XD;. Now it's doing stuff, and it is very mighty.

"event","Shifting through news sites and commentary by the Washington Post reminds me how much change this country faces now: and not necessarily for the better. <lj-cut>Legislation currently being kicked around by the newly elected democratic congress is threatening to revive taxation on Capital Gains. Which has historically and contemporarily been proven to damage and degrade an economy while not giving an increase in tax revenue to a government. Both in the history of this country and in other countries like Frace where and when such taxation was heavy, unemployment and inflation soared, and the people suffered. Compare that to the current state of the economy: inflation is undercontrol for once in untold years; unemployment is falling faster than analysts had ever hoped, as is the price of new houses (by 11%) and the number of them being sold has greatly increased. Moreover, the Federal Government brought in more tax revenue than ever in its history by a considerable margin this April--even with extensive tax cuts by Bush! This is no matter of magic, but simple math. 50 jobs being taxed 5k gives less than 100 jobs being taxed 3k. Tax cuts greatly help to increase the number of jobs out there as well as the amount people are earning in their jobs: which translates into more federal revenue in the long run. Increasing taxes is harmful. 

There is always a proper balance, as anyone who's played the Sim Cities know. But gees, I would like to make it manditory that people who want to be in congress play Sim City 2000 and make a stable, growing city before they are allowed to run our country: because there are so many bonehead mistakes our leaders make that are common sense issues.

It should be noted, I'm not saying all this as someone who is of one political party or another and wants my party to be in control, because it is ""my party"" sort of irrationality. I am one of those many people who sits on the knifes edge financially. After bills are done and taxes taken out, I have roughly only 160 bucks to spend for the entire month, for food and random expenses and gas. By Grace alone is that enough to live on for two people here in this home, and live without much hardship--but each month I'm left with only a few bucks left over if that. If taxes are raised, or if capital taxes (property taxes) are raised, I'll be in a heck of alot of trouble. Ironically, living in a house in this shady (though rapidly improving) area of the city is cheaper by several hundred than any apartment I've ever found in or around this city! And, those appartments still have utility bills put on them too. In short, I have no other living possibility than what I have right now.

There is no reason to fret or worry about the future, especially when one cannot change it at all. But it is something I have a great stake in and mindfulness to see how it turns out; as any changes will greatly effect me and others in my teir more than anyone else.

It's ironic that democrats say they are there to help the poor and the people, when really they create more poor and more harm than the republicans. That is, obviously, because the government cannot care for people, people must work, but they need business to give them jobs so they can work, and businesses to pay them well. And high taxes are the bane to all of that as we should remember from the Carter administration. Who we elect president for '08 will determin in a great extent the future of this country, and of the world. We need some one strong willed and minded; someone who won't be pushed around by the forces in the world and who has the head on their shoulders to take care of one's own people paramountly. Who knows that if one wants to prosper one's people, one must make an atmosphere of opportunity and possiblities.. isn't that what America is supposed to be about anyways? I don't know the presidential canidates well enough to know who may fit that role.. maybe Guiliani as he did turn New York around from ineffectuality and a corrupt police force to a prosperous and far safer city.. Maybe. All I know are who I can rule out; I have no idea who will be good.. if there are even any good choices to start with :/.

One other kinda gripe going on lately is that why the heck are so many of our leaders and potential leaders getting myspace pages? That is totally undignifying for people of their possition, I feel. Ah well, just part of the changing age.</lj-cut>

"event","I wonder if it is a surprise to people of how silly and bizzare I can be. Of course it is not really a surprise. One needs to be able to relax and release one's heart, as if a person stays in all seriousness too long, one begins to lose perspective and become so tightly wound about that which one is serious, that one can no longer distringuish self from the object of seriousness. Since, in the daily course of my livelihood, I am steeped in matters of most seriousness, that being science above which few things are more serious, I must be equally bizzare and carefree in the other direction at times that I can; in so doing retain balance and perspective from mind to heart. I have seen in many cases where this balance is lost, both in self and mostly in others; it leads to a restlessness, a sensitivity, and at times even depression and loss of purpose. It may seem strange, but our hearts are ment to be free and glide about whimsically at times; thus it is obvious why people latch to celebraties, TV characters, heroes and such things--as they give a fanciful glimps at worlds beyond the viewer's own place which allows the imagination to run and the heart to soar. Of course, such objects of imagination are ultimate let downs and do not last long, but they are simply the outward sign of the inner condition that most humans, or maybe even all as bold a statement as that is, feel.

Though the matter grows much deeper than this, and branches into many different paths, directions, reasons, and ultimates, none of that concerns me here when discussing my own behavior, abilities, or natures. It is simple important and so refreshing for me to kick back and even at the risk (or actuality) of making a fool of myself, be totally random and nonsensical. It is an act of balance and temperance. It is also a particular near irony that doing this switching habitually allows me the flexiblity to easily leap from one state to the other when the need precieved arises. One may comment, ""But doesn't such discontinuous modes go against the importance of rationality and linear thought you spoke of last time?"" to which I can only answer that it is actually the outgrowth of such things: it may seem an irrationality to let go of all of realities bonds in the form of silliness and limitless imagination, especially for one who emerses himself utterly in the rules and laws of reality, but really it's the ability to link reality with unreality that gives the power to understand and grasp reality to a far greater extent than before. It is, afterall, the ultimate definition of intelligence in the ability to associate things that seem desparate in a meaningful way.

It is then, as I've seen in all my journies, rationality that allows imagination and silly humor to exist; and imationation and silly humor that allows a capacity to think beyond the obvious and gain sight into the deeper aspects of reality. Most things people miss are not hidden things, but things right infront of their eyes, which they do not see because of lack of imagination, or lack of seeing things from a different perspective which can allow for it. Being able to jump world views, then, is a great and wonderful power and asset. One I have bearly come to appriciate or cultivate. So, it shall simply remain for me to be weird at times I choose and are appropriate, and oh do I enjoy it :3, heh heh heh.

In other words: where would the world be without dreams of creativity which bring to us the stories, music, shows, games, and ponderances that fill us with wonder beyond ourselves?

Liveliness! One of God's gifts to us to keep the world going round, hearts free, and bounds limitless."

"event","Been reading about the brain alot more lately, more specifically Richard Restak's book ""Mozart's Brain and the Fighter Pilot"". It is a basic book, not about the molecular biology of the brain so much as the physiology and the processes of it; which is why I got it since it has memory exercises and details about the workings of memory. But it brings to my awareness many things which I've observed but previously been unable to put into coherent terms.

<lj-cut>In this technologically wounderous age of Mankind, our brains are experiencing things that were never before so prominent or in such forms (as well as a new condition called information overload). There has been an epidemic increase in cases of ADD of most age groups, leaving most researches of the body and brain stunned and unable to figure out why. Explanations have abounded from strange chemicals, to genetics (though for a few rare cases that may be the case, I have seen no genetic evidence); yet the simplist and most astute answer is simply our culture. This answer is also the one best supported by studies, daily experience and observations, and by how the brain is known to function and impact the mind.

A few decades ago, the medium of communication and throught was the written word or spoken word. Both stimulate the left hemisphere of the brain preferentially (more so for writing than speaking as the language center is in the right hemisphere mostly). Back a few hundred years ago, it was astounding to people for someone to read silently to themselves because the written word was so rare. Both writing and speaking cause the mind to relax and slow and process the information it recieves in a logical way (more so speaking or hearing information, as reading now a days has become frantic in pace and actually stressful in some situations if one isn't mindful, so experiments and studies have shown, whatever their reliability. And of course, each individual will be impacted differently by the same situations). These days, though, the masters of our language are not only those who write, but television and images. Even in news casts, Restek points out, images are thrown together without any spoken connection; but simply to ellicidate an emotional response.

Images and emotions are preferentially handled by the right hemisphere of the brain. Since so much we do these days is visually based, from TV to computers, our right hemispheres are being engaged far more often than our left. Emotions and pathos have become the rule of thumb. If one studies politics and its evolution since a few decades previous, you'll notice that arguments are rarely substantiated with logical reasoning anymore, but simply ""No war, war bad!"" or ""Yes war, terrorists bad!"" without an outlook or discourse into reprecussions, reasons, proceedures, or propper debate. Emotions are what are being appealed to constantly; people say alot, but they do not use evidence to substantiate their claims anymore--except the evidence of our emotions. If we feel it is bad, it must be bad! and vice versa. How untrue that is.

This also has the effect of shifting our thought patterns. Humans, on studies and tests, have been shown to not think in linear, logical ways as much these days as decades prior. Images on TV and computers come in jumbled, disconnected forms. Likewise, we are starting to think in those manners. I can attest to that from my own self reflections. Although I attempt to use logic and linear reasoning wherever possible, I have noticed my ability to do so is slightly less than when I was younger and would read far more than now. Of course, I don't even watch TV anymore or for several years, but the computer has a similar effect, and I've come to have to consciously modulate my thoughts to keep them grounded and coherent. I've never slipped from being so, but having to put effort into maintaining it is a botheration. Likewise, the criteria for diagnosing a patient with ADD as stated in the psychiatrists reference book ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders"" is basically a description of right hemisphere dominated thought patterns. Therefore, people are being diagnosed by ADD at increasing rates these days because it is becoming an epidemic.. and induced epidemic. It is also worthwhile to note that if you use one side of your brain more than the other, the other will become less dominant in your thoughts; though you can switch between one and the other at any point in life--the mind is extraordinarlily plastic and we can literally change its shape, form, and function by the very thoughts we entertain. Stress also changes its form and function, as do other stimuli, but all can be controlled and changed by conscious thoughts. The Mind is, fortunately for all of us, greater than the brain. Unfortunately for all of us, most of us do not recognize we can or should use our Minds to override our brains at times, and simply go with what the brain recommends.

Now, one may object and point out that much on the internet is in writing, if not most things. However, one should recognize that although most things are in writing on the net, how many people keep only one window open or stay on one site that covers a single particular theme for too long? Flitting between windows, desperate sites of completely different topics, or even completely different topics on the same site at a rapid pace has the same effect. Afterall, although text is prevelent on the internet, it is augmented with many fancy imagry and layouts, as one can see even from live journal. I realized long ago in High School when the net was still young, that the layout and color scheme of a site instantly affected and set the mood in the individual viewing the site. Therefore, in context of what I have been speaking, the internet still engages the right side of the brain before the left; and the right is held in dominance over the left when using the net even though the left.

It is also important to point out that no matter how dominant one side of the brain is, the other is never ""off"" (unless you are a dolphin during sleep, or other air breathing, aquaticly locked animal during sleep, where one side must remain totally on for the purposes of breathing, but the other goes totally off to allow it to sleep). But, one side can easily become dominant over the other by simply the daily ruiteens we employ. Which side is dominant will vastly change the way our brain processes data and stimuli--to which side the data will preferentially be sent and interpreted by. Since the right side is a jumble of images and non-linear creative data, sending all information and perceptions to it mostly and avoiding the logical, coherent and evaluatory left hemisphere can both cause irrational emotional control over the person's responses and hinder the Mind's ability to evaluate those thoughts, responsense, and processes (Manic people complain about a racing brain which moves faster than their mind can put their thoughts into words. The act of puting thoughts into words is seperate from thoughts themselves; and can actually cause you to mentally trip and fumble on tests if you ""think too much"", relying on putting things into words for the Mind, instead of letting the brain dig the answer out of memory and put it down on its own). Therein, the plasticity of the brain comes to help and cause trouble: entertaining the wrong thoughs will make it easier for those thoughts to control us as our brains change to suite them, while we can just as readily reverse that, though it will require conscious effort at first, by entertaining the opposite thoughts and transforming our brains back.

Our culture is becoming more and more distracting. Many programs open, or multitasking too much causes chronic mental distraction. TV, with all its channels, commercials, and so forth is nothing but a huge distraction. Chronic distraction leads directly to symptoms identified as ADD. It is induced. As Saul Bellow put it ""Distraction catches us all in the end and makes mincemeat of us."" Or as James Gleick said, ""We have learned a visual language made up of images and movements instead of words and syllables."" This new language, which has become the modus apriori for many people in the modern world (since not many seem to read anymore), and will obviously carry with it new, unforseen consequences. 

Clear examples of this transition from logical and coherent to rushed and jumped and distracted can be seem by simply watching older TV shows and movies. How many people get bored watching black and white shows, not just because they are in black and white? How about the Johnny Carlson show, or Bob Hope? Compare side by side the original War of the Worlds with the new version that came out just a few years ago and you'll see what I mean. Far less talking, far less plot or thought, far more explosions, rapid scene transitions, and far shorter scenes in all. TV itself has radically changed towards a perpetual state of incoherence; unable to concentrate even about itself. TV has picked up ADD.

Is this a new state for Mankind, or simply more of the old? When I look at history, then listen to scholars of old times (or really old scholars still around) talk about said history, like the Greeks or first few centuries A.D., they see things in such a profound and intelligent way; while for us I fear the past is becoming completely alien. I don't think the next generation will understand how people thought or worked in the past, because they will be starting to think and work in a way totally new and unheard of. And no, heiroglyphs and pictograms are still contextual and writtin language that stimulate the left hemisphere, so even back then it was not like this. Still, I cannot say it is something new, for I do not know all of history; and really, there isn't much of anything that's new.

Though, I would like to remind many that this is about the modern world, as billions and billions live without any of this technology like we have. But... <i>that is rapidly changing as China and India finally modernize</i>. Never in the past were things quite like this, from anything I've seen. Already I can't stand the pathos and irrationality of politics now in every government that we keep news and tabs on on the internet. As pathos grows in power, I fear the world grows towards chaos. People have control over themselves, but they are apparently increasingly giving up that control to their emotions without second guessing or thinking about it.. because that culture says so. Though, this is probably something humanity has always faced. In the past, those who were ruled by their emotions were probably stereotyped as the ""ignorant peasant"" though ignorance is untrue (and it's untrue that ""ignorant peasants"" were the ones solely ruled by their emotions. Many a many crazy ruler and king certainly had not a wit or resemblance of reason or rationality in them!). Now though, it feels like these days that these people are the ones with a growingly powerful voice in the culture, and those who think, reason, and argue logically are starting to be branded ""intolerant"".

Also, let us remember that each person is an individual and handles/is effected by things differently. ""One man's stress is another's challenge"" goes the saying, and it is true. Each individual is absolutely personally responsible for how they act and respond towards stimuli, information, and perceptions. We are not totally helpless creatures (though it's true that most humans are slaved to ""sin"", which any observations at all of mankind are quick to attest), and we can make choices in how to act in any situation, even if we don't think we have a choice. Also, since all this stuff hadn't really began until my generation had grown and matured in age somewhat, I'm not sure if we are being effected nearly as much as the coming generations. Heck, how far one can be effected, and if some people are more subseptible to the effects of this new culture or not is something totally unknown. All of this is really unknown and only now coming to light, so keep that in mind and take all things with a grain of salt; but be aware. Awareness is a powerful weapon, one of the stronger there is, and a preresequite for many proactive things. Still, ""disorders"" associated with these new, right hemisphere ways of thinking are on a sharp rise. That includes ADD, and autisim/aspergers. Worthy of note is that right hemisphere dominance, and the mental patters of thought I have spoken of above are typical of autism/aspergers, and a major defining mental feature behind the pathologies of both.</lj-cut>"

"event","A random snippet of a comment made me think more on the ozone layer, and since climate change is a big deal these days, I have looked more into it from scientific sources (avoiding sources of both sides that have agendas). Now, I am perplexed.

There is a problem of the story of the ozone, and it goes like this:

<lj-cut>-UV radiation has wavelengths of around 300-30nm. Harmful UV radiation is around 300-200nm. Now, how is ozone formed high in the stratosphere where even lightning is a rare event? Ozone is made form the absorbtion by oxygen of UV radiation (first ! in my study). Diatomic oxygen absorbes UV light, most effectively at 280nm. It is then broken apart, and the single reactive oxygen species reacts with another diatomic oxygen to form ozone. Ozone then reacts with UV light to break down again; ozone will also naturally break down rather rapidly due to its highly unstable structure. This, of course, establishes a equilibrium concentration between O2 and O3.

-CFCs come in many forms, but all contain a measure of carbon and chlorine. CFCs are denser than air, considerably, yet somehow reach the same stratosphereic level of ozone at 35km or there abouts, where the weight of ozone being pulled down by gravity is balanced by its boyancy over warmer air in the troposphere and the heavier gasses of the troposphere. Ozone doesn't go higher because it's too dense to continue up into the mesosphere were some oxygen yet remains (and where noctulecent clouds form). CFCs should never reach this level of the atmosphere in any high concentrations (second !). Even when injected into the stratosphere by violent volcanic eruptions, CFCs only cause a 20% decrease in antartic ozone (or 3% globally) before they disappaite away.

-Now, back to the first point. Ozone and diatomic oxygen are in equilibrium. The sun is supplying a stream of energy that is beyond the concentration of oxgen/ozone to block, so some UV always gets through. This is a very important point as I'll show in just a sec. Now, if ozone is being depleted by CFCs, as anyone who knows thermal dynamics and kinetics will know, the rate at which diatomic oxygen converts into ozone should dramatically increase. The free energy to become ozone will become far more favorible as ozone is depleted by CFCs. Therefore, the standing concentration of ozone, since light is not a factor being as light is already saturating the system, should not change; but rather the levels of oxygen should slowly decrease as its converted into ozone and then into other forms by CFCs. In the CFC reaction, there in, ozone becomes a stable intermediate, and therefore should remain at the same concentration irregardless of everything untill oxygen itself becomes at such low concentrations as to start limiting the rate of the reaction! (third and very important !)

-This is incredibly strange. Now, to offer even more, take a look at these images of the ozone hole over the antartic taken over several years http://www.sbg.ac.at/ipk/avstudio/pierofun/atmo/o3-scans/o3-seq.jpg . I would like to point out, that the hole shrinks and grows; but most importantly, I would like to point out the band of intense concentrations of ozone that border the hole only when it is large (the orange and yellow bands). Interesting! The ozone hole increases in size, thus decreasing in ozone, but in opposite effect the area around the hole vastly increases in ozone concentration. (!!) What the heck is going on there?

More minor points to add:

-CFCs and Ozone are very negative compounds. A negative compound will not want to react with a similarly negative compound. Notice, from this source which details the reactions of CFCs with ozone http://www.sbg.ac.at/ipk/avstudio/pierofun/atmo/ozone.htm that the Chlorine radical reacts directly with ozone itself. Hm.. electrostatic repulsion anyone? That is not to say it is impossible, but the rate of this reaction verses the rate of an oxygen radical attacking ozone should be greatly lower. Oxygen is less electronegative than chlorine; it will have less problems getting near a negative molecule than chlorine, it also will cope worse with a radical than chlorine. Oxygen radicals are more reactive than chlorine radicals there in it seems; and if you look at biology, it's the oxygen radicals (commonly called free radicals) that cause the most harm to living systems due to these properties (and that most radical chemistry involves oxygen because of these properties too, making it a wonderful nucleophile in important anabolic reactions. Unfortunately, free radicals happen when a reaction doesn't go all the way because of stress or other chemical factors, that and even biological processes are not 100% effective of efficient in yield). Chlorine radicals are less effective; and the fuzzier (bigger) electron shells of chlorine should exasperate this problem. 

So then, the reaction of ozone with singlet oxygen to make diatomic oxygen should occur at a much greater rate than singlet chlorine with ozone. (chlorine, elementally, also is diatomic).

-CFCs and ozone are negative compounds. The hole in the ozone layer is found over the SOUTH, or NEGATIVE pole of the earth. The earth produces a magnetic field that is about 30 guass. That is equall to a refridgerator magnet. On the atomic scale, a permissive field of 30 guass is very substantial; it is most powerful and negative over the south pole, and most powerful and possitive over the north pole. The south pole has ozone holes that fluctuate, the north pole doesn't. HMMMM!

-Also, going back to that picture I linked above, notice that throughout all those fluctuations of the ozone hole, that the northern hemisphere showed no ozone fluctuations at all. Also notice that the vast majority of CFCs are produced in the northern hemisphere, and that they should be moved by the statosphereic winds to the North pole. It is not easy to jump the equator for a gas; and even to get to the 35km level of the ozone of the south pole, the CFCs first have to rise to that level in the northern hemisphere. If they did, they should react there first, shouldn't they? Why are there no effects in that area of the ozone? Over all, since the 1970's, global ozone layer levels have only changed 3%, which is within the levels of standard deviation (have to be above 5% to be significant), since our detection methods have also changed in those times, and error is immediately introduced when you change the type, number, or possition of a detector, whatever it may be.

-LA has been shown to be the most smoggy city in the US. However, almost all smog is made from... you guessed it... ozone! Thousands of tons of ozone are produced by US cities per year. Far less than any amount of CFC's, even at the hight of CFC production. Why, then, do CFCs not react with this ozone, which is at the same level of the CFCs on production, and why, then, does all this ozone not reach the stratosphereic level of ozone which is ozone's density equilibrium with earth's atmosphere and gravity? HMM! Very curious!

In short, I can find no logical reason to suspect CFCs cause the ozone layer depletion, except in the few cases where volcanoes physically throw them into the stratosphere, avoiding all diffusion from sea level (where they should remain!) as would be from old refridgerators. And even in those cases of volcanoes, the effects only last a few years. Moreover, form all pictures of the ozone layer; a hole forms, but a HUGE spike in the concentration of ozone occurs at the same time to the boarders of the hole. These concentrations spikes do not exist if there is not a hole, and only exist if there is a hole; and are greatest with the greatest holes. Averaged over, this shows not a decrease in ozone, but a MOVEMENT of ozone; a pushing of it to the edges of the antartic. Strange indeed! Very very strange indeed. 

Finally, and most damning of the CFCs caused the ozone layer hole stuff, is that the production of CFC's are at record lows now, and yet the ozone hole is as big as always, within yearly fluctuations that abolish it and then return it, of course (as seen in the pictures). If CFCs have decreased, why is there still a hole? And no, CFCs cannot persist in the atmosphere; they do not last long, and nor are they replenished in the atmosphere like ozone is. So then, what is REALLY going on? CFCs made by man should never reach the atmosphereic hight of the ozone, and they should react long before then. Ozone made by man should reach the hight of the ozone layer, why don't we see a massive increase in ozone? If CFCs can make it, then Ozone made by man most certainly must as well! Obviously, CFCs made by man don't make it!

So then, what is the hole in the ozone, what really causes it, especially since the ozone concentrations around the hole skyrocket when the hole grows, and decrease to normal when it goes away. What about the role of the earth's 30 guass magnetic field? Fluctuations in that perhaps? What about the solar environment? What about the polar vortex that forms only over the south pole, a vortex where the winds reach up to 100 meters a second and reach all the way up through the stratosphere, especially where the ozone layer is? Do times of a bigger ozone hole correlate to periods of intense south pole vortex production? Actually, so far that I've been able to skim out, they do. But there is so very little data on the two together. Also, those winds should act to push the ozone layer to the sides (AH HAH!) and or pull ozone down to the sea level. 

I dunno folks, but looking at the chemistry and physics of everything, it seems impossible for man to be the cause of the ozone hole (Especially since it does yearly fluctuate on its own, even if CFCs were eating ozone the equilibrium with oxygen should keep the levels of ozone the same till oxygen itself was depleted (which obviously hasn't happened!), and humans make many more tons of ozone at sea level than CFCs, yet this ozone doesn't increase the ozone layer? Finally, too, man made, sea level, ozone should react with man made, sea level, CFCs long before either can reach the ozone layer if it is even physically possible for the denser CFCs to do so in any ammount that could make a difference!). If man was putting out enough CFCs to affect the ozone, then, since CFCs are denser, shouldn't we have a CFC layer lower than the ozone layer? We don't; for we don't make that much CFCs, even at the prime; and now that CFC production has gone down, the ozone layer is still behaving the same, which really shoots the issue in the foot.

Still.. a profound mystery it is. Negatively charged atoms disappearing from the negative pole of the planet... OH yes, not to mention there is tons of ozone at the north, positive pole, even though it's that hemisphere that CFCs are mostly made in, and even though that pole also goes months without sunlight which is needed to create ozone. Obviously, ozone diffuses to that pole from the rest of the planet during the winter; yet in the south pole where you have the mighty polar vortex that occurs in the stratosphere at the ozone layer.. and only the negative south pole during the winter... you have a hole during its winter? Hm...

Much more information must go into studying this. I've bearly scratched the surface as to what really may be causing these fluctuations. But CFCs don't seem to be doing it at all. So, what is? And what does it mean for our earth and our future? Interesting questions that I see no one seems to care about either way.</lj-cut>"

"event","Had a great visit from one of Rachel's friends, who come yesterday, stayed the night, and just left a few minutes ago. It's great to have such wonderful company to enjoy, and we both would have favored if he could stay longer, but that was not possible as he had to report to his Drill unit.

At the same time, yesterday, while we were waiting for him to arrive, our neighbors came over asking if they could use the phone. I said of course, then asked why. The boy replied that their phones had been turned off. I asked how that happened, and he informed me it was because the service had been switched to the ""new house"". I blinked and asked when and if he was moving, and he said ""Tomorrow"". Sure enough, without any warning other than yesterday, they up and left today. Though, even to the last minute they were asking to get to share Laptop time and have some of our jolly ranchers; almost as if it were any other day. But nope, they have moved out, several miles away, so I will probably never see them again. Kinda took me aback at being so sudden; but it sounds like they are going on to better things, so that's good.

I got an A in Protein Structure/Function : D! And I rocked the Biochem final, and have a higher overall score in that class, so hopefully I'll get an A there too and get straight A's, as that would be oh so very helpful for schollarships/fellowships. My dad recommended I follow through with the Phi Kappa Phi invite, solely because of fellowship and networking possibilities, and I totally agree. I also need to work on getting the Chancellor's fellowship for UMKC, as that would help out.. so.. very.. very.. much.. X_x. An extra 11k a year would be SO FRIGGIN nice! I don't know if it'll go to me or to my PI, but he already said he'd be cool with it all going to me (even if it was sent to him), or at least part. Heck, if I got just 2k a year more, I would be set. I just pray the Lord sees us through crunch time till and if He provides with that, as it seems to be given for next year (you have to be in your second year to apply, so I'll start on that immediately, or at least June when I return to the lab full time). He has always provided miraculously and seen us through the straights thus far. My reserves are nearly gone, but we'll see what comes."

"event","Oh the advertisements I run into looking at news sites on the web. News is anything but unbiased, factual, useful, or a source of information that is beneficial. I have to look across many sites to piece stories together well enough to gain anything from them; but the reporting isn't the worst bit (or lack there of), but the advertisements. These sites, to the common person, come off with an air of authority, so anything advertised on them would seem legitement. Oh ho, the horrors they are in for. I wonder how many people have fallen for things like ""Instant Stamina!"" or those really annoying ""lower your morgage rates!"" ads. It's those lower your morgage scams that have the housing market in a pickle lately in the first place. Figures, eh?

Well, anyways, I wanted to post simply to get some ideas about biology off my head and tucked away where I can look at them again in the future if needs be. <lj-cut>Or, should I say, the act of writing, in some strange way, helps cement ideas in memory and heart. Perhaps it's that writing is yet another pathway through which to send the ideas. A pathway that tests them and fuses them into memory in another, synergistic, way. Or, perhaps, it has nothing to do with that and rather has to do with the fact one is paying direct attention to their thoughts again as they write. Most likely it's the last case, as I've noticed when a person writes something down, they are as likely, some times less, sometimes alot more!, to forget what they wrote simply because they wrote it and their mind doesn't need to store it. Alas, and this is why I'm working on memory exercises lately, since memory is my true limit apparently; yet physically the human mind has the potential (which has been proven from actual people who met it) to remember everything absolutely clearly through all of life.

Anyways, the keys to biology seem to be the fact that biological organisms are NOT like machines in any way, shape, or form. It is an often, and unfortunately misguiding, analogy to compare living systems to machines. That is not to say they do not do incredible tasks and that they are so meticulously and fine tuned crafted, tailor made, to their tasks as to be unbelievable almost; but they are nevertheless totally different things from the machines we make and envision.

Biological systems are about ratios, contexts, and timings. Cholera, Pertussis (whooping caugh), Anthrax, and The Plauge (Yersinia pestis) all attack and kill living systems by modifying signalling pathways. That is, either forcing a pathway to be on (as if the cell was continuously being signalled by some stimulus), or ensuring a pathway cannot be turned on (like with Anthrax which destroys the MAP kinase pathway, making the cell unable to respond to stimuli, throwing it out or whack and sending it spiralling into destruction). Every pathway in the cell is intricately interlaced and interacting (let alone whole organism level pathways), so that changes in one bring changes in them all that leads to a certain response. For instance, the NFkappaB pathways can either cause a cell to grow and proliferate, or cause the cell to go through apoptosis which is controlled self destruction. The exact same transcription factors, and pathway, can do either absolutely opposite spectrumed result. But how?

All that comes from the context, what other pathways are signalling. Cancer itself is simply a cell which has been balanced incorrectly (or transformed by a virus/mutation to have certain signalling pathways turned on constantly), and had its checkpoints damaged so they failed to notice the imbalance. 

In the area of timings, one just has to look at diabeties. A signal left on and too strong will cause a cell to desensitize from it. It's a ""boy who cried wolf"" problem. And when the signal is actually leget and important, the cell will not respond and things go ary.

All biology, disease, etc. boils down to ratios of signals and molecules, their timings and contexts. Therefore, fixing many sorts of diseases, cancer and alzhiemer's for instance, comes down to knowing how to turn off and on certain switches and how to change certain ratios to correct levels. Of course this means you must know what the current ratios are, and what current switches are on. Symptoms and the nature of the disease itself is the indicator for the most part; but it is the profound challenge of medical science to detect a patience cellular and organismal level state. To cure cancer, then, requires knowing what signal to send those cell in their current state that will be interpretted as a death signal, and which won't be interpretted as a death signal by a patience normal cells. The nature that normal cells intrepret it as is also important, as that's where side effects come from to some extent.

Yes. A cell in whatever certain state will see signals and respond to them differently than a cell in a different state. Nitric oxide (NO) will cause smooth muscles to relax, yet make the heart beat harder (contract stronger). The very nature of the cell, which defines its context as well, determins the response there too. It's so intruiging. And there in lies the key to defeating cancer and so many ailments. Knowing the key makes searching it out possible. Yet such a difficult thing it can be, as timing is also important. Not too much for not too long; not too little for not too short.

Then I read things about herbs and what they do, and it is so intruiging. So very little is actually known in biology. Sure it is presented as if everything is solved. But largely, especially whatever you seen in the news, is all speculative. All science aims for is to make a model that describes what we see and helps us predict what we see next. Science can never describe reality in full, as we can never observe reality in full. Yet, usually, models do way more than enough for us as it is. But, it's something that must be made aware of, and it's why there are ""glitches in the system"". Why things never work 100%, and can never. We humans simply use the laws of nature to do what we want, yet we don't even fully understand them. That's the difference between science/technology and magic: the former uses the laws of nature to gain some goal, the latter changes the laws so the goal is accomplished. Magic is beyond all human power; and we bearly understand science/technology, for we bearly understand the laws we live and die by.

I hope I can use the things I've been learning to solve some problems of this world for the bettering of all. However, I remain acutely aware of my ignorance (and the ignorance of humanity as a whole) over every subject under the sun. I suppose that's what makes science so fun, and gives me a job because there is so much out there to explore and discover, one must simply be creative and I've started to learn how to be correctly creative in the scientific community (or so I hope).

Now that I have a lab to be in, we'll see where things go. NMR is a very promissing field, so I'm glad I chose it in the end, even if zinc-finger proteins don't seem overly interesting on the outside; and I'm not sure what potentials there are in them--that still remains a lack of imagination on my part, and is a problem a scientist must always be aware of. For twenty or more years scientists saw Titan on every single raw gel they ran when looking at the proteins in muscles; yet they never realized it was a protein nor that it was absolutely vital to the structure of muscles in all those years. 

So often the obvious stands in our faces, yet we grow accustomed to what we are doing and miss it, or simply lack the imagination to see it for what it is. I pray I always remain aware of that, and don't fall into those traps myself... too often (as certainly I do and am even at this present time. For if we all didn't, then every problem under the sun would already be solved).</lj-cut>"

I suppose true content should be put in this LJ for once. I haven't put many thoughts in here for two reasons:

1. I've answered all my own questions to date. 

Yes, I've answered all those deep philosophical questions for myself (I in no way mean all the deep philosophical questions that are out there! But only those I thought up or were common and had most bearing or whatever); I know my place in relation to the universe and so forth. My mind, heart, and soul are at peace (though no surprise there with Christ as one's foremost, even if my mind doesn't dwell as much as it should on Him), so there is little to bug my mind into contemplation. I have my answers.

That means, all that's left to really regale is whatever I come across seeing someone else ask that I haven't thought about before, or which makes me think of things in a new light. Or, whatever I wish just to share. That last one makes it sounds sort of like instruction which is worthless in this area of life (and not that I could ever give good instruction, but just repeat what is good anyways). Nah, share is just that, sharing what's in one's heart.

2. I've had nothing interesting to say, not much time to say it, and alot of work to do in other areas in my life.

Once a certain point is past, other matters become pressing. Once those questions were satisfied, and more pressing matters came up such as school and biology, attention went there. And for good reason, for a great deal of thought I need for what's to come next in my career and such. Yes, I had an advisor and lab now, but that only opens pandora's box.

Still, my mind is always thinking; and without ponderances I just daydream lol. Imagination never stops; it just gets channelled from one thing to the next.

But a thought has come to me lately. A cummulation of observations really after watching people and debates on all manners of things. It's funny how much so our experiences are but the smallest drop of a near infinite bucket of what's out there. So much we even see, but don't realize or remember the significants of.

There is more in this world than we can even imagine.. Yes, in this very world we are in. Six billion people make for infinite combinations, or nearly so. It's funny, because it is typical for a person to feel contrained in this world, but really it's an illusion and an artifact of the familiar. There is so much out there... so many examples, ways, events, and so forth. 

The news is a horrible way to learn about the world, for it is utterly biassed. Not simply in how it reports, but actually in what it chooses to report. So much slips its notice.. I can spend all day scouring news and bearly hit on much about what's been happening in the world. I know, I've tried.

And yet we ultimately feel that what we experience and the sphere of our knowledge is all there is to the world? We assume that what we see is the norm. The apriori of existance. How wrong we are. It isn't an arrogent assumption in the sense of arrogence. It's an innocent assumption that our brains naturally make; for we cannot imagine what is outside all frames of reference of our existance. And yet, the majority of the world lies out there in that beyond realm. 

It is sadder to note, that so much strife and foolishness comes from the fact people instinctively think what they know is all there is. The source of Pride? And Pride is the source of nearly all other evils."

"event","School is schooling as ever. Time to do my interviews and select my adviser. Pray that I pick and choose wisely, as it'll decide many things, like the very projects I'll be working on to make my PhD dissertation fly. As well as define my experiences for the next several years. Someone I get along with and whose project truly stimulates me to come up with my own ideas is critical. I have one person in mind, but.. still, I must evaluate everything carefully. Thus, this week is going to be busy. 

I also need a haircut before my hair devours Russia and sparks international war.

But, in other news, Rachel's mom (who's awesome possum to say the least) and her sister (and her sisters two kids), are coming up to stay with us and visit for a few days. Thus, I won't be on pretty much at all this week.

I also need to study like MAD. The proff in my Biochem class ERASES all her notes when she puts them on the net, rendering her notes and slides worthless or near to. It's vexing after a fashion, but not really. I've just grown so reliant on slides lol, which is silly as that's not how things have ever been too these later technological years. Nevertheless... it is kinda vexing in that I don't know what's on there or not, and so I have to play a guessing and scribbling game to get down what I can before she, all too rapidly, moves on. 

Anyways, I did terrible at my last two tests.. friggin terrible. So, I must remedy this situation now and pull out with my full A's while I can (so I work towards and hope with a prayer and a sweat). Responsibilities, eh? Once I have my perminant lab and am settled in.. things will be much more lax in a sense. Not so much scrambling... but, once classes are over for good, things will be REALLY nice. And that won't be till the end of next year. Heh, and next year I want to take every class I can.. Three instead of two? Yes, I'm a crazy man XD. We'll see how this goes.

I also got this great book called ""Mozart's Brain and the Fighter Pilot"" by Richard Restak. Very good book on the brain and actually has some good memory exercises! As well as references to other memory books. I need to start doing them (and my physical ones), as if I can superpower that aspect, all the rest of this intellectual stuff will be much easier. It's my greatest weakness intellectually (so far that I know) right now, so empowering it will be an incredible help.

Enough prattle from me. Time to go into the breach!"

"event","I suppose it's time for a long overdue journal post. Yeah, I come here often, just too busy, or lacking the motivation to make a post when I do, harhar.

And thus the world got warm... and the Ged rejoiced. It has gotten very nice now, which is a pleasant thing. My experiments are going.. well.. hey, they are finally going! One out of ten working at least gives me something to work with XD. Eh.. I don't look forward to the opportunity of trying to figure out why the other nine aren't showing an insert, but I think it is just bad conditions for the PCR. We'll see.. one is all I need to start with to get the much covetted data my Prof needs for her grant, then I can figure out the rest. 

Science is alot like cooking in a way. You play it by ear, mix things together, and hope it works. Thankfully, science is more controlled than cooking, since I suck at the latter, but do just fine with the former. It just means it takes days to figure out parameters with the former. No wonder science goes so very slooowww. But I'm not complaining at all, I'm glad I can finally move forward!

Fortunately, the whole experience has left me with alot of ideas of what to work on for my dissertation finally. I think I'll go with the person from my last rotation and then try to solve the structure of her protein, Heparanase (and find an inhibitor and all that good stuff). Since, it is so related to cancer and that's something I want to help. 

I have two tests this friday, so I'll need to study all week. Thus, it's busy times for me.

What's interesting though, is the more you learn, the more complex the world becomes. It isn't that you gain explanation to answer questions.. you do, but they open up a world of new questions. Which, however, is extremely serendipitus for me since I need questions to ask to formulate my own research and stuff; and infact, I need to know even more about what is not known so I can do my scientific work, make breakthroughs, lala. But still, the complexity of the world is absolutely stunning. Seriously stunning.. and I thought things were complex before now. Heh, I'd seen nothing yet, and even know it's all just the tip of the iceberg. I see where irreducible complexity comes from, as it's quite true.

For instance, all life, absolutely all life of any kind, depends on iron. But why? It's because of this one iron containing protein called Nucleotide Reductase. Without it, you can't synthesize the nucleotides used in DNA and RNA and ATP and all that stuff. And is it a simple enzyme? Nope. Proteins, no less, are absolutely required for life to exist. 400! That is not a small number, considering a single protein is ungodly complex and could never have just appeared. My goodness.. how ignorant some scientists make themselves. Oh.. that's just the tip of the iceberg in itself too.

Time for lunch, and studies. OH! I finally started on Kingdom Hearts 2. Friggin rocks my socks. Far more amazing a game than I had envisioned. Now I need to finish chain of memories though as there are so many unanswered questions... rar!"

"event","Started my new lab rotation today. Most of it is actually going to be almost the same with what I went through in my first lab rotation, except hopefully I can do in a week or two what I did in ten weeks there. Then I have to purify protein and try to crystallize it to get an X-ray structure... 

And all this on small pox :D!

Ok, it isn't the human small pox, it's the mouse, rabbit, and monkey genes I'm working with. Specifically, we are trying to get the virulence protein that small pox makes that keeps our cells from self destructing upon infection. Dangerous stuff. Here I go from immuno response proteins, to radioactives and cancer lines, to small pox family virus genomes and deadly proteins XD. But yes, it looks like fun. A heck of alot of work, but a load of fun, especially if we (me and the tech) succeed in getting these things to crystallize.

In more boring things, test went good, another on monday in the other class, wooo. Gotta prepare for the labs I teach in, keep up on studies for the weekly quizzes, and just enjoy the heck out of everything. Ho ho ho!

"event","Ironically, I just said in my last post I'm not entertianing because I don't do reviews, and yet.. I must rave about this awesome anime XD. Sorcerous Stabber Orphen! (no, he doesn't stab sorcerer's, he's the one doing the stabbing (most of the time))

Why is it so great? Because it's the only anime I've ever watched that is truly well writtin! Seriously, this thing is alot like a greek tragety; yet like an epic at the same time. There are more twists than liberals in congress, and most are not ""contrived"" but actually make complete sense and logic. And then there's the character interactions... oh gosh, those are to die for. The dubbing is absolutely unbelievable (I watched it only in english, so keep in mind all this only applies to the english version); and the way the characters interact is genius. Character's are just developed in what they do, like most stories, but in what they don't do in Orphen. It may seem a little slow to some, as most animes are very plot thin action fests, and while Orphen is chalk full of action at times, the action is logical and realistic (within the bounds that this is a world of sorcery), and unlike almost any anime out there Orphen isn't a ""power house"" anime (where the characters get stronger and stronger and then at the end have to fight this uber boss that could have wiped them out early on but just never seemed to do so). Orphen stays true to itself from beginning to end, and it leaves you with alot of mysteries. It's the first anime where I had to bite my tongue from wanting to yell at cartoon characters on the screen because they weren't doing what they should.. if they knew everything you the viewer did, which they didn't; and thus they acted exactly like they should be for who they are and their possition, realisticly.

Just.. amazingly writtin. Leaves you with a feeling of completion, yet even the last five seconds of the anime is a twist, so they never get tired of playing with their audiance X3.

Gooo, check it out! 

Anyways, back to doing what I should be, which is studying for the Biochem test tomorrow.. woooo."

Of course, this just puts me closer to the time when I must decide my projects but... Truthfully, I like the project I was just doing as it has the ability to be applicable to helping cancer patients. I'm such an applied scientist at heart.. UMKC is just mostly basic science, and not alot of applied, so I was feeling left in the drift, but this topic has great potential... yessssss...

Urg, lab rotation is technically over, but actually I'm still slaving away trying to get this experiment to work >X(. Stupid me left my western membrane uncovered and it dried out, so I had to start all over again. And hopefully, by a miracle of God's, the western will still work and I'll get pretty results :D! 

At least my abstract is ""done"" upon review from my prof. I just have to work on the presentation from here on.

My new computer is up and running. Only one stick of ram and the crappy refurbished dvd drive I first bought didn't work. But I have a new drive now and eventually OCZ should send me info on how to return the bad ram stick for a replacement. They are being slow, but I'm also being impatient when I shouldn't be. Anyways, I should be around from time to time now. I still need to clean up all these boxes in here and get the laptop and Rachel's comp set up for wireless networking.

Ah, things are great. Quiz tomorrow already, hah XD. Oh yes, mostly school is the same as last time. Biochem II at the same time as the first one, but Protein Structure and Function comes right after at 10. This means that I have thursday completely off :D aside from lab work. I teach the same class too this semester, but this time only one class instead of too, so wootage on that (and they seem very interesting, I like them already). Only one student is there from the last time, which is a good sign.

I must see Seph more... We need to make a web site for intellectual studies; ponderances, philosophy, and investigation into the Word some more. There is an amazing radio station here in Kansas City I get to listen too from time to time, and many a gem of wisdom have I gleamed from it, and rarely anything I find I don't share the same view on. It's so interesting. The world is so deep; but most people never get the chance to see that, never get the chance to get the knowledge and opportunities I have... and I must not waste it frivilously. So much I want to do, but so little resources and such...

The seminar speaker today was talking about stuff very akin to what I had been hitting around to develop. Now I know people are developing things along the same line, blarge. That isn't bad at all, as that means some of the basic work I won't have to do, if I pursue this that is. I'm still not sure what I want to do... Maybe somehow I should go after the idea of using carriers to selectively deliver drugs to cancer cells (the seminar person is doing it in light of treating viruses). But.. it doesn't totally excite me yet. I guess there's just so much I need to read and think on; many decisions to be made, all of them important. However, I must relax and not worry, as that's the first step to accomplishing anything. Things will be as they should be.

Well, enough from me. I need to reinstall all my backup data now that I have a working DVD drive, and then study for the quiz tomorrow. AHhhhhhh the sound system on this new computer is to die for.. Thanks be to the Lord that I can hear to appriciate it!"

Sah, I had this brilliant scheme to build computers and sell them on e-bay (since building computers is as easy as breathing for me, oddly), but e-bay fees are astronomical now a days. It was a grand plan with grand profits... I'm still considering it through other avenues if there are any good ones. Since I know how to buy parts cheaply (the computer I'm assembling would go for double what it cost me if you bought it from a company, hence why I want to do the same >:3), reselling for profit would be a breeze, but WHERE to resell is the issue.. Curse you fees of E-bay! You're like the East Indian Trading Company, and we all know what happened to THEM. HAH

Rachel is well! Almost totally. Had to take her to the ER today, but they nuked her system with major antibiotics and now she's kicking the disease's butt. I feel so bad for her for how long she was sick (over two weeks with three different things in a row), but she's strong and is just fine; so all is well.

I need to start studying for the upcoming semester which starts this monday. Yes, study before hand because.. these aren't just classes but my livelihood/future. I need to know everything. I found if one studies with the frame of mind of retelling what they are learning months down the road/to teach others, then it helps one learn and retain information to a far greater degree and depth. A little trick of the trade I picked up.

Welp, it's getting late and I think Rachel is falling asleep (she needs it) so time to mosy off. My computer parts should arrive tomorrow (or Monday)... which shall begin a great festival of constructing and installing and FUN. I can't wait to see what it can do. Ahem, I mean.. I must keep in mind what good uses I can put it to as well, yess... it is a toy and a tool, and I must use it wisely while I have it.

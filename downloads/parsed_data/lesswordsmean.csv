"event","Dear livejournal,

it would have been nice to have an electronic outlet again but, seeing as this one has been invaded, I must retreat to paperjournal.  At the very least, I won't be writing here anymore.  As I've said before, the thrill of livejournal is writing with an audience, as if the audience didn't exisit.  And it's been a long time since I truly wrote that way.  Somewhere back in the days of glitterary.  This was an attempt to get back to myself.  My Self.  Silence and words.

I'd stop the world and melt with you.  I loved you, I'm sorry, I wield swords and utter apologies."

"event","Working 9-5 is the stuff of Dolly Parton songs.  Working 9-9, now, that's workin' hard to make a livin'.  I'm the man among boys, except I'm a girl (which is more the stuff of Jean Genet).  I'm starting to see what Shauna was talking about at Chapters.  There's a certain cliquishness among some of the employees and somehow I think I've ended up on Melanie's bad side.  How?  On the plus, the end of the world is coming and Smith is getting renovated at the end of July.  My excitement knows no bounds, except those like having to work again tomorrow after having worked yesterday (very patriotic, spend your day working for Canada's monopoly and your night in a line of traffic trying to get out of the Beach with the onset of that drumroll caused by alcohol.  I am.  Indulging in Stereotype, it was surround sound).  I am exhausted and I don't even know why I'm typing, which is only using up the little energy I have left, the morning's coffee's rush thinned in my blood.  I was going to write N, but I don't know what to say.  What is there to be said?  

There is a certain heaviness to this day, as if the clouds, heat, and air were the excess of the kindergarden child in the sky, an excess of white glue: thick, sticky.  A child prone to mood swings, beaming hot rays of sun and crying hot tantrum tears.  Or: the great percolator in the sky.  Hot water, the earth damp dark and heady like just used coffee grounds.  Ground, grounds, grounded, unsound.

Tuesday seems so far away.

I just realized that I spend more time at work than I do alseep.  I spend more time shelving books than I do reading them."

"event","Strange Dream (Nightmare?):  Irrational over-reaction to Dr. Chase telling me I was straying from the text.  I don't know how I over-reacted, it was more of the feeling I got from it, so to be correct irrational over-resentment to Chase's criticism.  On the first level, it can be a general anxiety over lack of focus on paper and lack of movement in classes.  Also, anxiety of what others, esp profs, think of me.  Chase as father figure?  Lacanian or Freud?  Lacan: as Symbolic father, that of school & language; am not entirely in Symbolic?  Freud: believe I am disappointing own father?  feel am being criticized by own father?  Own father encourages lack of direction, encourages wandering-- and then 180's, ref: wants me to talk to Jon about signing up for university.

Strange Dream (Nightmare?) 2:Was walking down a street in North-Central area, or rather started walking from Cathedral but street became more North-Central-ish.  One storeys and unkempt yards, fences with peeling paint.  Full heat of summer, daytime, very green and blue.  Came across girl splattered on sidewalk, she was intact but in the dream I felt/reacted like she had been splattered.  Convinced she had been thrown out of a window.  Another girl came by, a police car.  I get into police car and next dream/ dream shifts slightly so that I am in Geoff's cop car and we are driving around the industrial side at night with the general feeling that we had to clear our names/ solve a crime.  Analysis?  Freudian?  Lacanian?  Jungian???  Nothing.  Except for end, recurring theme-- Nancy Drewism.

Sometimes I feel I'm the only vegetarian who has elaborate fantasies about foie gras.  Carrie eats meat and even she doesn't fantasize about foie gras.

I'd hate to breakdown the inside of my head: I think about: hair & skin products.  Boys (subcategories: boys I know.  Why do I still call males who are technically men boys? If you're supposed to be with a dosha who balances your dosha, why am I drawn to other vatas?).  Dogs.  Swimming pools.  Arid climates.  The mechanics of time machines.  Decorating the house I will live in when I'm 50.  If Geoff and I had children we'd spend all our cash on orthodontics.  Probably the same for Dhani Harrison and I.  I knew it, Stephen King and Margaret Atwood are in cahoots.  Waffles.  Paisley clothes.  Posture.  Ice cream.  Freud.

If I start thinking about El Jacques, my mind drifts like this: I should be wearing my retainer.  Lacan=Gaze=Screen=Baudrillard=Geoff.  And so it turns out that in mythology, Echo was in love with Narcissus?  So we find ourselves in yet another triangle (triumvirates: Freud Ego Id Super Ego, Lacan Real Symbolic Imaginary, Catholism Father Son and Holy Ghost Eastwood the good the bad the ugly, High school self Geoff Joel, college self Geoff Nathan, self Geoff Echo) she being named after a car and I narcissistic reading about narcissism ""It is one's own self that one loves in love.""  But I am not Douglas Fetherling.  I am not cake.  No wait Stephen King, rather Margaret Atwood strikes again.  Edible Woman.

Question: in lit, the good tend to be slightly overweight while the bad, not bad, but... are thin?  Not universal, but Gowdy Atwood texts would support.  So is this something that arises out of Canadian female identity?  No, Jung? myth, typical associations of bountiful, fertility, mother with love to give, goodness.  While bones, sparse miserly, edged.  Smarts (which can be intellect, which can be pain stinging.  Coincidence?)  So why most evident in books by thin women.  Repeated in Gowdy.  Gowdy in fact sorority and weighty attributes in both Angels & Sandman.

Dissolution of sentence structure.  Fitting.

Haven't even addressed the issues at hand.  Which I forget now and would like to draw my attention to the phrase ""at hand.""  And perhaps now that I look at it ""Fitting.""  Because if the glove does not fit we must aquit.  Which makes no sense but this is a more accurate portrait of the mind than a graph.  So I'll leave myself with a memory/theory, perhaps my fixations of amateur neurology can all be traced to tenth grade biology, taught by Geoff's aunt, when Joel scalded his hand making a model of the human brain.

Mosquito bites.  No calamine.  But a craving? longing? for bare feet on the tiles (cool, red) of Beaumaman's terrace, with night mountains church steeple in the distance and foie gras on baguette.  Rabbit mushrooms and green beans.  White plastic chairs.  Personalized napkin rings.  Roses.  Salad.  Wine.  Mocha Russe cake.  Clearing dishes.  Sleep.

I blame this all on the combination of looking at cookbooks at work and the Euros."

"event","If this summer is all about input, the next must be output.  And already it seems like the output will be worthy of a gold star, all glue popsicle sticks and semic sets.  Applied to whom or what we still don't know.  But nothing can be known.  Just follow the vertical co-ordinate: Context (text) Context.  CON: a dupe, an elaborate lie, fraud, Freud.  It always returns to Freud.  Actually I always return to daydreams of ice cream, dogs and tall boys (men?).  Which does nothing to help the Cause.  The only thing that helps the Cause is the Job/s, as I've paid off (with my sanity) the last semester's tuition and now start paying the next's.  Working one job at 3 stores is driving me slightly up a wall (ivory tower) and considering my inner compass currently reads clockwise Context Addressee Context Subject, I never really know where I am and end up answering phones with gaps and the wrong store name.  Damn it we are all Indigo in the end so why bother with Coles/Chapters/Smithbooks?  It would save me the trouble of thinking about where I am (stalled at the crossroads of life) and all cashiers the trouble of explaining that the membership card can be used at all 3 locations in the city.  The more I try to live in the moment the more I am driven to an inner dream world where I read in a hammock.  But instead I read in a carrel in a library that smells like paint.  The university is ann odd place to be in the summer, you see more maintenance workers and painters than profs, and the students all seem to be either ESL students or honours/grad students, both incarnations of the stereotypes.  I never really noticed the amount of people here with Luis Vuitton bags.  I have bags under my eyes, and I don't even have a social life.  The only person who could offer me a social life has run off with my books and my brother.

It is freezing in this building.  I need either tan or a haircut.

And everytime I see the number 10 bus (Woodland Grove) I think of squirrels and other forrest animals frolicking and wearing little suits and carrying little briefcases, little forrest animals with little baseball hats and little coffee cups.  I often think about sharing these little vignettes in my mind with my professors to say ""See? Are you sure you really want me here?""  I can't honestly be thinking of spending the rest of my life reading things which get the Five Man Electrical Band stuck in my head."

"event","My conscious and subconscious are telling me two different things.  I think the sub- si telling me that I want to do something and act out or be an underground rebel in a dystopic future.  I think I'm weak and that at most I would probably disagree internally and just go with the flow.  I think.  In anycase while I live in fear of Handmaid's Tales I do look forward to a Brave New World, or a Giver.  I want a pill that controls my hormones and have my future dictated.  I want random sex and soma.  I had this conversation more than a year ago with N.  ""If I had no feelings I could be the most intelligent woman on Earth"" or something like that.  Anyhow.  My arteries and veins are all wrapped up in my fingers.  I feel in need of a DIY lobotomy kit.  

This morning was all charming madness, I couldn't stop sketching things like Freud in a suit and a tilley hat (obligatory walking stick included), spelunking in the mountains with the caption ""Great moments in history: Freud's Discovery of the Unconscious"" or a chalk outline of a book and a police officer saying ""Sipcowicz, get a hold of Jakobson"" to represent ""the murder of poetic language"" which is really just a rip off of Woody Allen's private investigator and the case of ""God is dead"" (though it would be nice to make a collection of pseudo-crime scene photos, Barthes and the Death of the Author, Eagleton and the Death of Theory, and a mircale of life documentary, Nietzsche in a maternity ward for The Birth of Tragedy, etc).  But this is not the point.  After a few hours of such madness I took to the computer lab where I am confronted by the entire mess of the N situation.  My life is good, my love's a mess?  It seems that everything is a case of being able to breakaway cleanly.  And yes I was the one to wield scissors to flash the sword, to say the words (actually, he had to say the words because as Carrie said incredulously ""You were crying?  I thought you were the one breaking up with him?!""  Because what if I've made a mistake?  There's the crux of the matter.  I loved him at one point, no?  I loved him even before drives in the sun to used bookstores and before Mexican food while it rains.  Strangely I can listen to Bjork and Beth Orton without crying but the minute New English plays I start having to hide in the back.

Conspiracy theory: the mall muzack selection is based on the employees minds.  Last year everyday in May they played Beth Orton ""Thinking about Tomorrow"" as I anticipated meeting him.  Now it's the best of the 80's at work and when I get home that car commercial ""I'll melt the world..."" and I start to melt.

Obviously I must be spayed? neutered?  Have a four foot iron pole lodged in my cortex?  Find religion and join a convent ([J] does bear a freakish resemblance to brown haired blue eyed bearded depictions Jesus, if Jesus wore polo shirts and retro sneakers and listened to loud music, etc.  Meanwhile N loves Jesus complexed characters ie: Tin Drum, Burnt Out Case)?  Just lock myself in an ivory tower and devote my life to Lacan? Seems I already have, what with my shifting signifiers of the signfied.

The nieghbour, who likes to give advice at the drop of a hat (I don't wear hats and if I did I would anchor it to my head because I tend to dislike advice) tells me to not overthink things, but overthinking is just my reaction to overfeeling.  I walk in circles, I sit on fences, and ultimately I use the pronoun I far too often.

I will blame everything on the weather (the kind of cold that comes after days of rain, turning blankets and sweaters into the only refuge and leaving the bed to boil water becomes one of those blind battles pioneers faced fetching fire wood in blizzards).  The weatger, or simply starting the day badly, waking up from a detailed dream in which I was the servant girl to a witch who couldn't survive water if she hadn't eaten children.  When I turned on her I had to run away as after pouring water on her she shrieked ""It's your fault girlie!""  as she ran next door to, presumably eat Northie and regain her powers.  Instead of doing laundry, cleaning the bathroom, doing yoga, etc, I lay in bed with Antonin Artaud.  

""The cinema involves a total reversal of values, a complete revolution in optics, perspective and logic.  It is more exciting than phosphorus, more captivating than love.  One cannot go on indefinitely destroying its galvanizing power by the use of subjects that neutralize its effects.""

Then after deciding that I had to get up and do laundry, I fell asleep.  Only to wake up at 8:00 and the reality that my next day off isn't until some point in the week after this coming one and that I would at some point be forced to chose between dirty clothes or clothes banned by the dress code.  Which in any case, I need to buy clothes that comply with the dress code at some point.  But my priorities are school, new contacts, and the new PJ Harvey record, which just sets my heartstrings longing for afternoons with Caro and sunshine.  Or just sunshine.

I will not let my family steal the names of my unborn unconceived children.

Susanna, Oliva,  Elise, Betta/Benna, Margo/Magda, Sygrine.  Sebastien, Peter, Noah/Jonah, Sam, Xavier.  And Frodo.

No, no, not seriously Frodo.  But I pity the child borne of parents who enjoy the hobbit scene a bit too much.  I would put Alphonse on the list, but I'm not that cruel.

Was perhaps more informed and in touch than ever during my absence from the internet, as Dad took to printing out every article he read for me.  Also took to actually writing in my paper journals, and even wrote my first poem of sorts in more than a year- the last being a reflection on numbers, the alphabet and infatuation while smitten with [J] and finding myself interested in N, and now a Bloody Valentine, a cardiac arrest and acquittal that came about after breaking up with N, reading the newspaper and seeing that [J]'s film was one of the ""ones to watch for"" during the national student film & video festival.  Last night I dreamnt of [J]: running hand and hand through some inane yet at times weirdly wonderful mall or airport, until we had to join a group of people rescuing hamsters on the field of runway tarmacs.  In the dream, at the end, I had this sense that we would never see each other again and in reality I know this is true.  Never again will we chase rodents in the night.

It's been raining men, unfortunately, as N makes me feel guilty for breaking up, as I return to my distraught adoration of [J], as the Stalking one discovered that I work in a different store now and spent 45 minutes not looking at books.

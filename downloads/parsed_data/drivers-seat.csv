"event","so i changed my layout page. i don't know if i like it better...it has more color though, so it's sort of...cheerier...more cheery? anyways.
i kind of want to try and use html and all that fun stuff to make my own layout, but i'm feeling lazy and don't know if i want to go through that process. the only time i've had practice with it was when i had a myspace and liked to customize it (but i deleted it a year ago, so i'm kind of rusty). reading the codes was sort of fun, but i would end up feeling frustrated at the end with a headache, so it seems like too much trouble.

i'm sort of hoping that i'll get into my lj again. i was checking and it wasn't since last year around this time that i was actually more frequent with entries. it was sort of fun looking back and seeing how much of an idiot i sounded like. i mean, i guess i still sound like one, but it's more funny when you look back at it. 

i really like the song ""zhong jian"" by lian jing ru. i was trying to find the english translation of the lyrics because i'm really wondering what she's saying. it's such a pretty and sad song. every time i listen to it i can't help but feel a little lonely. i don't know, but it's a really interesting how it makes me feel. so i'm just wondering what she's saying. i need to make a chinese or taiwanese friend or something.

<i>heroes</i> was awesome tonight. but there was no peter...at least i don't recall seeing him in this episode. though, i was doing laundry and trying to make dinner while watching it, so i was running around during parts of it. milo is so dreamy. and he's a cancer. haha, i guess that doesn't really matter though. but it's unforgivable that alexis from gg broke up with him (those damn virgos).

well, i better get to sleep or something like that, since there are a couple of things i need to do tomorrow before my 6pm class. for one, i need to finish printing and filling out my applications for studying abroad so i can turn it in sometime this week. 
i seriously have a problem with spelling the word ""abroad."" every time i write it, it comes out ""aboard."" i have no idea why. if i didn't remember to check it would've turned out that way again. 
...maybe i'm dyslexic (haha, had to sound that out). it really annoys me, since i've had to recently write that word a lot. agh. it's just not cool.

ttnf- at ta fro own. 
what."

"event","So I updated my journal. The color has changed from reds, yellows, and oranges to purples and blues. It looks kind of girly, but I wanted it to match with my Garden State icon, since I liked the colors in it. 
So whatever.
I'll see if I want to keep it this way. I really love red, but this is something different."

I'm going to be surrounded by hot guys! First there are the guys from MCR and the Used, and then there are the guys in the crowd. Now that will definitely be heaven."

"event","I want to get a Myspace account. I tried to get one awhile back (during summer vacation), but they stopped the year before my birth year; meaning, I wasn't old enough. But that is totally ridiculous, since you have to be at least 16 or 17 (I can't remember which) to join and I was at least 17! See! Ridiculous! And I didn't try again. Sure, I could've lied, but...well, I don't know why I didn't lie. 

But now, I want a Myspace account again. And I think I don't like xanga anymore. Mainly because no one really ever commented there; so I felt all alone. *sniffle* lol. I'll mainly just go back to read my subscriptions. 
Is Myspace really that great? I don't know. Should I? Or shouldn't I?"

I went to the Winterguard tryouts (the ones I was forced into doing). It was fun, which surprised me. I like the rifles the best so far. The dancing part sucked. You would've laughed if you saw. Really horrible, but I laughed while I was doing it so I guess it's good that I could laugh at myself, right?

"event","Well, yesterday in my xanga I posted something about my laziness, since I was writing an essay that day. And I felt that what I said there should also be posted on my LJ. So here it goes:

 Hmm, maybe I should think of being lazy as a disease. You know how a lot of smokers can't quit the habit of smoking? Well, that's how it is with me and being lazy, I like it too much and I know it's not good for me, but I just can't get over it. And I say smokers are stupid and deserve to die or have really bad health problems (I know that's all harsh but that's how I feel; don't even get me started on pregnant smokers), but in a way I'm just like them! I know being a procrastinator isn't good for me in any way at all; the stress from it can lead to heart problems (I'm sure I'll get a heart attack eventually) and starting things late means that I won't always finish and even if do finish, it could  turn out crappy. Yet knowing all of that, I continue to be lazy, just like a smoker continues to smoke. I am what I dislike. Wow. Funny enough, I just thought of that comparison just now and now it helps put my laziness into a whole new light. Hmm, weird. Maybe that'll help me get over it? Or maybe I'll just use it as an excuse and say, ""It's not my fault I don't do my work on time! I suffer from laziness. Jeesh people, don't you have any compassion?! *mutters:* Heartless bastards."" It'll be just like how doctors are ""discovering"" new mental diseases for extremely stupid things that really aren't mental things, just lame excuses (I watch Law & Order a lot and see that happen.). Or how people are suing McDonald's for ""making"" them obese. *scoffs* 

So that's what I posted. Now if only they had a patch just like the nicotine ones, maybe then I would be able to get over the damn laziness. But currently, my thought is, ""laziness is my friend."" Yep. Oh, and that essay, I did finish it on time, though, I only got one hour of sleep. So now I'm dead tired.

And by the way, in my LJ posts there are times when I'll probably copy and paste from what I said in my xanga. However, it usually won't be the whole post and I might edit things out. The reason being that my xanga is my more personal journal. So that also means I probably won't update that much in this one as I do in my xanga. Whether this is good news or bad for you...? As Stephers says, ""I gotta cheese it."" Hmm, that doesn't sound right, but I'm too lazy to check if I'm right or not."

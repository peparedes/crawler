"event","<P>Well, It's been an interesting 24 hours. He knows I want to step back from this. The news wasn't taken well. I tried to let him know I wanted to still do things, just seeing each other constantly isn't healthy right now. Am I being too soft? I'm not saying if I was in his situation I would react differently. I know this is the best thing...so why do I feel so guilty for doing what I need to do. Like people have told me before...I am a doormat. I always put everyone's happiness before mine. I think it's time I start considering my feelings along with others. But that doesn't take away this awful feeling that I am hurting someone. It sucks!! I just feel horrible. If anyone can shed any light on this...feel free.

"event","Yes, like almost everyone else in Tampa, I watched the game.  As a result, I am almost non-functional at work today.  It was fun watching the game with my Jen...However, something seemed to be missing  : (  It's all good though, some good things happened prior, so I am still smiling : )  I definitely have a few things to tell some people, but that's for me and those precious few to know(I gotta keep a few things private).

"event","(WARNING: All names have been removed to protect the innocent)  OK, so Saturday was a good day/night.  I was at Disney, my favorite place in the world, as most of you know.  I didn't get to see the EPCOT fireworks : (  But the person I was with wanted to leave....AGAIN!!!!  But, whatever.  So I get back home to watch the Lightning game (they won, THANK GOD), and the roommate had some friends over...finally some people contact!!!!  So, I have  few drinks and the group determined we needed more, so off I go to go pick up some more--not to worry I didn't drive!!! I get back and continue to drink.  Well, the first thing to piss me off occurs...It's a Saturday, I'm drinking having a good time...and the freaking idiot goes to sleep and doesn't say a damn word to me.  What the hell is up with that?!  Why am I even here?!  What am I doing wrong?!  I don't get it.  I'm not that ugly, I'm fun(when I'm allowed).  So anyway, I decided that it was my damn turn to have some fun...so F*?! IT!!!  I continued to drink (I think we can all see where this is eventually going to end up) One particular person that was there that night continues to stick out in my head.  He was cute, very nice, and good to talk to.  His eyes were almost speaking to me.  I think, that when you look into someone's eyes, you can read alot into a person...I saw good things.  Yes, I was flirting.  I'm not sure if he appreciated that or not, but I was hoping.  Then all of a sudden, all the power went out.  Apparently, someone had hit an electric pole with their car.  After we had made a little amount of noise the monster awoke, was pissed about what was going on and he and a few of the guys went to check it out.  I stayed at the apt.  After they got back, he went back into the room, and once again, said absolutely nothing to me.  WHAT THE F*@!  I'm over it, I wish he would just act like my feelings mattered.  Anyway, back to the story...  Then 2 of the guys went for a walk to try to walk off the alcohol and I and one of the guys stayed in the apartment.  That's when it hit me that I was sooooo drunk.  Yes, the sickness began.  The guy that had stayed in the apt, helped me to the bathroom.  He even came back to check to make sure I was ok...very sweet guy!!!  I made it back to the couch, he kept checking that I was ok as I began to fall asleep.  I could feel his warm body behind me...This tells you what a nice guy he was because he tried to make no moves on me (not that the thought hadn't entered my mind).  his arm was on the back of the couch and I leaned into him.  It felt wonderful.  He kept using his hand to gently, softly rub my back.  Something that comforts me and makes me feel wonderful (he was not aware of that, I just think it is interesting that it was done perfectly by him).  I then wanted him to know that I appreciated what he was doing for me.  (NO PEOPLE--I DIDN'T GO THERE!!!) I could feel his skin under his shirt.  It was so soft.  I hope he understood what I was trying to say.  It just felt so wonderful to be held, I felt so comfortable after a very short time of talking to him.  I wanted him to wrap his arms around me and hold me close, but I understand why he didn't.  Then, a little while later, I began to get sick again.  So I had to go into the room, take care of myself...and he awoke.  Not that he cared before, but anyway...I cam back out on the couch afterwards, and began to go to sleep again.  I didn't want to be in the room.  He had angered me sooooooooo much.  As I laid on the couch, he asked me again if I was ok.  He reached his hand over, and I held it.  To try to let him know I wanted him there.  It was wonderful.  But then the bedroom door opened, and his hand pulled away.  The monster came out of the room and insisted I go into the bedroom.  It was only like he wanted me in there because he didn't want anyone else to spend time with me.  Where the hell had he been all night...oh yeah...sleeping!!!  It felt like too little too late.  I was still pissed!!!!  I tried to tell my wonderful caretaker thank you, but I'm not sure if he could see me.  I think I have figured out his screen name on AOL, but I'm not positive I have his last name right.  I just want to tell him thank you, and that my actions werent' the alcohol speaking.  How do I know you ask?!  Because I still feel the same, and I can't get him out of my head.  I would love to go to lunch with him...or better yet, take him to lunch to say thanks.  Well, that was my weekend.  Crazy stuff.  My life is changing, for the better, and I just need to learn to be strong and folllow my heart, my true feelings.  If anyone knows who I am speaking of, and can assist me in this endeavor, please do.  Sorry for the novel-sized entry, I just had alot to get off my chest.  Talk to all of you soon!!!"

As long as I can get a ticket without losing the shirt off my back....although that could be fun.  It will be a nice break for me.  If anyone wants to tag along, let me know...the offer is out there.  Everything else is going well.  Saw Troy this past weekend.  All I have to say is yummy bodies.  Sad thing is it wasn't who I wanted.  Anyway...that's for another time and place.  Well, gotta work now, drop me a line anytime."

If I do, will someone please be straight up with me.  I know part of this is a self-confidence thing with me...so I apologize for being one of those girls. It doesn't happen often, but it does happen.  I just want to know that someone will like/love me for me.  Wheter I am being sweet, the occaisional party girl, listener, the sports nut...whatever.  It irritates me when I am told that I am not good enough.  All I know how to do is be me.  I guess I just want to know if I am losing my  mind and that I am wanted (in many different ways).

Well, I love my job...except for the fact that it is so far from the city I want to be closest to.  Most of my co-workers are AWESOME!!!  So..it's decision time.  Where will I live in a few months.  My heart is telling me to go with Jen...I think it would be good for me.  NO one to tell me that I need to be more compassionate, that I need to do things better, no more feeling like I'm not good enough!!!  Well, I am planning a trip up north in the fall.  Just don't know when to go yet for sure.  I CANNOT WAIT!!!  I just hope that things work out as best they can in that situation....yes, i'm nervous about it.  I won't force them.  If it is meant to happen, it will.  Happiness and comfort, on both sides, is the most important thing.  Well, I'm at work, so I should get back to that.  I'll just leave everyone with this....


If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time

Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time

For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time

Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for

Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time

I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for

I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time"

"event","Haha so I am not going to be doing anything else tonight...might as well put up the snowboarding pictures.  Little background on the trip itself:  I was having dinner with some friends that live near me and one of them mentioned that he was going snowboarding for the weekend.  I freaked out because I was going through snowboarding withdrawals having been on my snowboard 75 days last year.  So he called his friends that he was going with (who I did not know) and asked if I could come along and they said sure.  So I was stoked about this and we were to leave in two days, so I didn't have to deal with being so excited for too long.  Anyway, Friday comes along and my friend tells me he is sick and isn't going...and even though I didn't know the people he was going with, there was no way I was backing out of a chance to go snowboarding.  Whatever - the drive up to the place we were riding at was supposed to take 4 hours...instead it took us 6 because the maps the guy who was driving had were the worst maps in the history of maps.  We made it to our hotel at like 3 a.m.  I woke up at 7, super stoked to go ride, and much to my displeasure, everyone else was slow to rise.  So we got out to the slopes around 10...it was a gorgeous Saturday in Hiroshima <a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v368/rolltide81/DSC02740.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Image hosting by Photobucket""></a>
It was nice and warm, so the snow wasn't so great, but whatever, snowboarding is snowboarding and its so awesome.  Made some new friends.  I got a new hat, too <a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v368/rolltide81/DSC02749.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Image hosting by Photobucket""></a>
Subnote on the picture above.  Note the guy standing next to me.  He kinda pissed me off because I told him about posing with ""the open mouth""...a thing my friend Richard and I do occasionally, you know, to be that guy.  Anyway it irked me because this guy, who I barely know, was blatantly stealing me and Richard's move.  I felt like David Putty from Seinfeld.
Okay, so finally, you'd figure with all the snowboarding I've done over the past couple of years that I would have some actual shots of me snowboarding.  Alas, this is the only one <a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v368/rolltide81/104609148_f71c99681f.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Image hosting by Photobucket""></a>

Japan is a lovely country filled with many lovely little people and, conversely, a seemingly equal amount of strange ways of doing things that test my patience on a daily basis.  But I try not to dwell on the negative :)  I visited elementary schools for the entirety of last week.  Cute kids with great minds, but man do they have energy.  I am getting so old.  The week before that my junior high kids made mochi, a type of Japanese desert made out of - amazingly enough - rice.  You basically heat it up until it becomes like dough, then you knead the stuff with a hammer <a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v368/rolltide81/DSC02723.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Image hosting by Photobucket""></a>

"event","Since I am much faster at typing than I am writing (and because my obsession with penmanship might end up costing me 8+ hours of my life), I am going to write some thoughts down using the less trendy, yet trusty livejournal.

Not much is going in Japan or in my life.  And this bothers me.  I am wasting time.  Wasting the one life I've been blessed with and the incredible opportunities I have been granted.  I turned in my decision form 2 weeks ago stating that I would not be staying for another year of teaching in Japan.  I miss having friendships that aren't surface-level.  Its probably my fault that the friends I've made while traveling aren't closer to my heart than they are.  I guess I am just not that trusting.  Anyway, I have no doubts about and am completely comfortable with this decision.  I didn't spend that much time wrestling with this decision.  Of course I thought about sticking around for another year - the job is fun and I get paid well.  But I can see myself being a very bitter soul come this time next year.  What's funny about this decision and subsequently all of my other decisions concerning the paths I've taken in this life is that I didn't really pray that much about it.  A ""Help me do what You want"" here and a ""Tell me where You want me"" there, but that's about it.  I can't decide what to think about this; I know that I am making MY own decisions, but are these the decisions that God is telling me to make or am I truly just making them based on what my selfish grave of a body wants?

I need to spend more time in thought.  And with God.  For so long now I've wandered.  I'm not sure why, either.  I have, however, narrowed the list down to two reasons: 1)I am incredibly lazy and selfish with my time; 2)I was never all that close to God.  Its actually a combination of both these factors, with more weight being bore by the lack of true relationship with God.  Its easy to pretend when you're constantly around people who actually have a relationship with God or are pretending, too.  Step outside the bubble and you start gasping for air.  Before you know it, you're drowning.  You've collapsed.  Its only a matter of time before those who know you begin to realize they don't really know you at all.  Actually, I'm not really sure I even know myself.

Here's some things I do know, though.  I know that I believe in God, even though my life is definitely not any kind of testament to that.  I know that I am not depressed - been there, done that...I am sure I am not depressed.  I know I have a wonderful family that I often take forgranted.  I know I am lucky to have somewhere I can call home.  I know that God will forgive me.  He's already done it.  

I don't know how to accept His forgiveness, though.  I don't know where to start.  I can't comprehend it.

And the scary part:  I don't have the desire to seek out the answer.  Or at least I haven't had the desire.  I always thought the desire would come back in a rush.  Like there would be an amazing breakthrough.  But I think I am coming to find out that perhaps its a gradual thing.  Maybe other people go through stuff like this (I would be really surprised if other people didn't go through stuff like this) and maybe our falling apart happens at different paces.  I wish that I could shatter into a billion little pieces and start over.  I think I may need to be broken up into even smaller parts, actually..."

"event","Hope everyone had a good weekend.  Here's a recap of mine...

Friday night I went to Kumamoto to see some friends that I haven't seen since leaving for the holidays.  It was nice to catch up with them and hear about their journeys elsewhere.  We ate alot and drank some beers and then sang some karaoke until about 3 in the morning.  I lost my voice around 2...I had been teaching at an elementary school earlier in the day and spent a good portion of my time there trying to calm the kids down, so I knew my voice wouldn't hold up too well after that.  Anyway, I still managed to dominate Bon Jovi's ""You Give Love A Bad Name.""

Saturday, after a surprisingly early start, I set out to clean my apartment.  I say set out because this was a daunting task.  After about 4 hours of continuous cleaning, I decided to take a break for the day, but was pleased that I didn't skimp out on cleaning the shower and bathroom.  I went back to Kumamoto to watch ""Proof"" with some friends.  I thought Ms. Paltrow did well with her character and was glad that the movie didn't have too much focus on Jake Gyllenhall (sp?) of ""Brokeback Mountain"" fame.  What I especially enjoyed about the movie was the realness of the relationships between Paltrow's character, her sister, and her father.  If you see it, let me know what you think.  

Yesterday I traveled to the neighboring town of Nagasu to watch a festival called ""Matobakai.""  I was there with some kids who live near me and some Japanese folks that take care of me...I tried to get an explanation of the festival's meaning from the Japanese folk, but they pretty much told me that there was no meaning to the festival activities, but it was supposed to celebrate boys entering into manhood.  Here's how it went down:  First of all, the men of the town are clad in nothing but a sumo-type thong (remember its about 30 degrees outside)...they all drink a crap-ton of sake, get fired up, then they retrieve a ball of hay from the town's temple.  Apparently the hay was something that God had sent to the people of Nagasu back in the day as a sign of some good harvest...how hay symbolizes a harvest is beyond me.  So after someone gets the hay they all form a rugby scrum-looking mass and basically wrestle to get some of the hay off the ball in the middle.  All this while people climb on top of people's heads and shoulders and while outsiders throw cold water on them.  The men who make it to the top of the pile then start calling for their boys (I believe boys who were 2 years old)...the children get passed to them and they hoist them up over their heads as everyone cheers...meanwhile the boys are screaming bloody murder because they are so scared.  After about 40 minutes of wrestling, the horde starts moving toward the sea and when they make it into the ocean (remember, still 30 degrees out), the festival ends and everyone in the town gets a piece of the hayball, supposedly bringing them good luck for the year.  Crazy.  I'll post some pictures on the website either today or tomorrow... http://spaces.msn.com/members/jonathanmorgan

I've got a gnarly cough from a long weeekend."

"event","Hello.  Just sitting after a lovely school lunch, enjoying the fact that I can pretty much eat whatever I please here and still manage to lose weight.  This is much needed after my time back in Alabama over the holidays - a steady diet of eating whatever was in sight mixed with alot of sitting around resulted in more than a couple pounds gained.  I need the extra weight, though...its so freaking cold in my apartment that I need the extra layer of insulation!  Its pretty sad when you can wake up in the middle of the night and see your breath.  Did I say sad?  I meant scary.

I hope that things are going well for the readers of this journal, whereever you may be!  And my apologies for not being in better touch, but my Internet access was cut off because I failed to pay three months worth of bills.  It was an honest mistake :)  I will hopefully be back online towards the end of this week...until then, take care!"

"event","Well its these times that I hate being so far removed from the United States.  My prayers are definitely with those who are being directly affected by Hurricane Katrina.  The pictures and video that I have been able to watch over the Internet are pretty amazing...hard to believe the destructive force of hurricanes.  However, what is even more amazing to me is the fact that people refuse to evacuate these areas.  I hope this doesn't sound too heartless, but hurricanes are nothing new to Gulf Coast residents.  We know all too well what they are capable of and yet, for reasons beyond me, people choose to be stubborn and try to ride them out.  Perhaps we will all learn from this and be wiser in the future, although knowing humans, I doubt we will.

Tomorrow I start working at my school.  If I said I wasn't a bit nervous, I'd be lying.  I am just ready to get the first few weeks out of the way...then things should be smooth sailing when I get into a bit of a rhythym.  Speaking of rhythym, the new Death Cab for Cutie album is pretty darn awesome (thanks for the heads up, Matt).  

Last night I couldn't help but feel extremely blessed, sitting in my tiny room on the other side of the world from everything and one that I know, and yet still knowing that the one and only God, a God who loves me fiercly and pours out His mercies on me freely, was there in my room talking with me.  I like knowing that."

So today at work I really didn't do anything but read manga and its awesome because I can actually pass this off as both work and studying.  I think I am living every nerd in America's dream...getting paid to read manga.  
Oh, I have also spent some time on the internet, thus resulting in this post.  Other sites visited included the Muji Store site, from which I am planning on buying a better futon from.  The one my Board of Education gave me sucks (not to sound ungrateful or anything).  
Today for lunch I had a Hokka Hokka Tei bento, which is truly one of life's simple pleasures.  Everytime I go into one of their shops, I miss my friends from Osaka and the lady at the shop that was right across from my school, whom I visited everyday without fail.  Maybe sometime this year I'll get up there to visit her. 
Tonight I am going into the city to watch The Island, which I am semi-excited about because it will be in English and I will be glad to not have to think about what people are saying.  I think I am going to eat okonomiyaki as well, which is yet another one of life's simple pleasures.  Basically I am going to do whatever it takes to get out of my hot apartment this week.  
Pictures soon.  I promise."

Thanks to everyone who came over to Atlanta Friday night to see me off.  We had a really good time and the whole staying up all night ended up being a great idea, even though I was not feeling too hot as I was getting to the airport at 7 a.m.  Glad I had some friends there to help me with my bags...I thought for sure my bags would be well over the 70 lb. limit Northwest Airlines has, but I was under by 2 pounds on each bag - nice.  Everything actually went really well at the airport, aside from being a little grumpy as a result of the no sleep thing.  I lost my cell phone, too - I think it fell out of my pocket on the plane to Detroit, but the flight attendant said she didn't see it.  Oh well, I guess I was planning on getting a new one when I get back to the States anyway.

The reason I said that staying up all night before my flight to Japan was a good idea is because I slept for 10 of the 13 hours of the flight.  So I was feeling like a champ when the kid next to me hadn't slept a wink on the plane and was mad at me for having slept 7 hours straight.  In fact, he said he was starting to think I was dead.  Nice.

When we got to Tokyo, I chucked my bags in my room and started to hunt down my friend Hugh from Australia.  We were great friends back when I went to Kansai Gaidai in college, so I was anxious to see how he was doing and catch up with him.  After a little test in my Japanese skills, I found him and we had a lovely dinner together.  It was super fun reminiscing about the days of yore and I think we worked ourselves into a pretty good excitement about making some more memories in Japan.  Its too bad he won't be living too close to me, but oh well, I will take some trips to visit him.  

Alright well I am gonna try to figure out the phone situation and call home.  Hope this post finds everyone doing well.  Oh and if you don't already know, I cancelled my AOL account and am now using jaygeemorgan@hotmail.com  Send some love!"

It was a great time as the movie was hilarious, although the ending was awful and abrupt...its like they just got tired of having fun and decided to call it quits.  Oh well.  Some advice:  you might not want to see the aforementioned movie if you are a) a girl, or b) against foul language.  Just a heads up :)

After the movie we went out to Dave's in Five Points and had a few drinks and some good conversation.  Richard made me smoke a cigar, too.  I think it wrecked my sinuses and I have felt a bit crap all day (I am typing in a sweatshirt and some scrub pants with tissues at the ready).  Oh well, its been a lovely excuse to be lazy and read the new Harry Potter.  150 pages into the adventure and I am loving it.  Ms. Rowling most definitely has a gift.  Oh, I tried to pick up my preordered copy of the book last night after the bar, but alas, I could not join the kiddies for the festivities (Probably because I showed up at 2:30 a.m.)

last night some good buddies came up from tuscaloosa for dinner and drinks.  went to p.f. chang's which is always good (except for me having to prove my chop sticks skills to the unbelieving every time we go).  after dinner we met up with some more people and went to innisfree downtown.  it was my first time to go there and i was pleased with how the evening went...for the most part.  no use beating a dead horse, however.

today i walked around the bruno's for a bit, not because i wanted to watch golf, but rather because i needed the sun.  i mowed the lawn with my shirt off yesterday and couldn't believe how white i was - maybe the whitest i have been since birth.  i guess that's what spending six months in a jacket will do to you.  the bruno's was pretty nice and i ran into some folks that i haven't seen in some time, so it was fun to catch up with them.  this is the last year that the bruno's will be held in my neighborhood and i think i speak for my neighbors when i say good riddance, because i am pretty tired of all the hassles that come with the tournament.

everything else is going alright i suppose.  i can't really figure out girls, which i guess i should be used to by now, but for some reason still surprises me.  on the agenda this week:  more job hunting and probably more coming up empty.  we will see, though.  this weekend:  haley's home, lake tuscaloosa...should be fun."

"event","this entry should be a mix of light fun and heavy thinking.

first the heavy i suppose.  i really have no clue where i am in my faith.  i have never felt more lost/abandoned.  i know that this wandering state that i am in is my fault because i brought it about through my sins.  nevertheless, i am not sure what else i can do now.  the battle that is going on in my head is trying to remember and bask in the truths that God has promised me while there are voices telling me that i am not worthy of His forgiveness nor does He care to forgive me.  there are times, in the recent past and now, where i feel that God has chose to not know me anymore.  of course rather than trust Him, i rebelled and now am the furthest away from God that i have been since birth.  

i know that God has plenty of forgiveness and love for me and for all of His children whom He has called to His kingdom before the founding of the universe.  i just pray that my mind can somehow grasp these truths...knowing that the prodigal was his father's beloved and that God used total wrecks like Saul and seemingly perfect beings like David to advance the kingdom is definitely encouraging.  pray for me.

on a lighter note, i have been privledged to listen to some great music lately.  it was a relief to find that the new weezer album does not suck.  their last two releases were mediocre to piss-poor, so all i can say is ""its about time, weezer.""  i also purchased the new ryan adams album (cold roses) which was sort of an impulse buy at best buy.  anyway, its really easy to listen to and is definitely better than ""rock-n-roll"" which i didn't find too exciting.  i find that the best part of this album is his voice, which has gone back to being twangy and country-sounding.  hooray for alt-country and another hooray for obscure music genre naming because its seemingly impossible for me to try to put a singer/band in some category (like when i am messing with iTunes).

I love Birmingham.  There, I said it.  I love it here.  2 years of traveling here and there and everywhere, and I haven't found a place that compares.  God definitely blessed the south with gentlemen and belles, college football, and sweet tea.  I am, however, getting a bit tired of my dad riding my back about getting a job - I mean its to the point where I can't take a bathroom break without him asking me if I am being ""productive.""  And its not like I am lying around - I am definitely trying.  Its just there is only so much you can do, then you have to wait for a interview (hopefully).  I had two interviews today, both with small marketing firms in Birmingham.  I think the interviews went well, but we'll have to see if I get called back for a second interview.

Let's see, what else.  I am glad to be out of Colorado and the cold.  The snow was really getting to me.  I was tired of never being able to keep my clothes clean.  I still have my snowboard rack on my car, which is fun at night because people seem to think that they are lights and that I am a policeman.  So what if I get crappier gas mileage...its fun to keep people honest.

I got the new Weezer album last night.  I had not really planned on buying it since I wasn't a huge fan of the green album and Maladroit, however those crafty marketers got me with the sticker on the front of the CD which said stuff like ""Recaptures the magic that Weezer brought us on the blue album and Pinkerton.""  That was enough for me to at least give it a try because I think those two albums are pure genius.  I've listened to it a few times now and have to say that I am enjoying it more than I thought I would, yet it's definitely no Pinkerton.  Good enough, though.

Okay.  Barons game tonight for ""Thirsty Thursday"" as my friends have dubbed it - $1 beers and 20 cent wings.  Shouldn't be too much baseball being watched.  Hope all is well."

"event","Shew, I made it through January, which was quite hellish here.  The phones rang pretty much constantly for the entire month, thus requiring us to work 6 day weeks.  A 6 day work week is torture because there is no rest in sight.  You may get one day off, but you have to use that day to run errands and, of course, to snowboard :)  (I just notched my 52nd day on the mountain this morning, thank you very much).  Then its back to work.  Boo hiss January and ski vacationers.

Thankfully, this job will be over in 2 months.  Then its back to the drawing board.  On that note, I am going to be back in Birmingham on February 20th for a few days because I have an interview in Atlanta for the JET Program (English teaching in Japan).  So, if you have some free time and are desperate to see me, lets hang out :)  *Side note:  Haley, my plane goes through DFW, so if you can tear yourself away from rock climbing or the cult, maybe we can get some great airport food together)!

I need to get some pictures of me snowboarding.  I will work on that so I can post them on here."

And I am sure the Livejournal community has been pining for my return.  You will all be happy to know that I am still out in Colorado.  The past month has had its ups and downs, for sure.  At the beginning of the month it started snowing one day and it literally didn't stop until a week later.  They reported 4 feet of snowfall at Vail for the week and I wouldn't have believed it had I not gone snowboarding out there and been up to my waist in powder.  I've never had so much fun working so hard.  The people out here are a real treat, too.  Well, most of the people, but its not worth even talking about the bad apples.  

The downside of this month has been that we have been extremely busy at work, which has translated into 6 day work weeks for me.  And that, my friends, equals not enough snowboarding.  The workplace has turned into a warzone, of sorts, as well.  Everyone is on edge because we are so busy, mistakes are being made, guests are jerks, etc.  With all that said (and alot left unsaid), I will be ready for this month to be over!

Its weird how fast time goes by.  I am not sure if this recent apparent speed-up in time passage is at all related to my having graduated, but I have a sneaking suspicion that it does.  Before I know it, I'll be middle aged and single, with nothing to look forward to but a 9 to 5 desk job.  Blah.

I miss work being slow because then I could sit around and daydream about what I am actually going to do with my life.  Right now I have plans to go to London after I leave Colorado towards the end of March.  With traveling comes friends from all over the place, so its worked out that I have an Australian friend with relatives in the U.K. who have invited me over to stay for a bit.  Likewise, I have a Scottish friend who will be in south France and an Irish friend who will be splitting time between Ireland and Barcelona.  Work has provided me with a cheap (and by cheap I mean free) flight to London, so I figure that now would be a good time to go since I have free lodging.  However, I am going to have to find a way to save money to defeat that pesky Euro/Dollar conversion rate :(

After my trip to Europe, the plan is to head back to Japan for a year to teach English through the very prestigious JET Programme.  I haven't done the whole interview process yet, but that's coming up in the very near future.  I guess my acceptance and forthcoming deadlines will truly dictate my trip to Europe.  

Alright well I suppose I should get back to working.  Tonight I am going to the Denver Nuggets game in Denver, so watch for me in my Marcus Camby jersey looking oh so white (or half-asian).  I had planned to buy an iPod tonight, but my paycheck was rubbish this week and I can't risk not being able to pay my rent.  Look at me managing my money.  I will try to post some pictures soon...I've got some good ones of me and lots of snow!  Oooh sushi tonight as well.  Hope things are well where you are!"

well christmas is looming.  yet, it really doesn't feel like it out here.  i find this odd because with all the trees made white by the snow you would think i'd be singing ""it's beginning to look alot like christmas"" constantly, but i guess not having family or good friends around makes things a bit different.  or maybe i'm just putting off the christmas feelings so i don't have to think about the lack of money i have for buying presents...

it snowed about 8 inches here two nights ago.  there's nothing like waking up to white everywhere.  i do a little dance when i wake to fresh snow :)  i was really stoked because i didn't have to work until 11, so i figured if i was out for first chair, i'd be able to get like a good hour and a half of snowboarding in.  yet, i waited in line for 30 minutes only to have the lifties tell the crowds that some of the towers had ice on them and because the wind was blowing they weren't going to open the lift i was waiting at.  long story short, we bailed on keystone and went up to a-basin, thus lodging my 16th day of riding in this season (even though it was only two runs.  the snow was off the chain, though.)

work has been pretty okay lately.  busy.  i took the most calls out of anyone in my office last week.  unfortunately, that counts for naught.  oh well.  my boss asked me if i would be willing to help out the ski school reservations group for a week around christmas.  he told me it was because he felt that i was competent enough to handle it.  i think he might have been lying to me because i suck at sales.  oh well, it will be a nice change of pace.

tonight - 17th day of snowboarding.  tomorrow and sunday - singing in the choir at my church.  if i get some pictures, i'll post them.

Work sucks - or actually, I suck at work.  I am pretty terrible at the job I am doing out here and it put me in a pretty terrible mood yesterday because I was especially crap yesterday.  I definitely needed a drink last night and so we went to my friend's Irish pub up the street, which is an excellent place for a drink and a chat.  My friend who owns the bar works with me and he put me in a better mood by reminding me that I am not out here to work, but rather I am out here to snowboard, and so I shouldn't worry about it.  And he's right.

Got up this morning before I had to be into work and got some snowboarding in.  It was fantastic.  The sun was shining, the sky was a deep blue, and I was pretty much by myself for most of the morning.  I like the feeling I get when I snowboard - I like actually being good at something, since I seem to screw the majority of things up.  I think I might try to take out my digital camera with me one morning and shoot video of me snowboarding.  I'd like to see me do it.  And trust me, so would you.

"event","Well, if I was honest with you all, I'd have to admit that I do feel a bit sorry for the Auburn Tigers.  We, Auburn and Alabama, play in the toughest conference in all the land, and to me, there is no way anyone could argue this.  If you look at the conferences that USC and OU play in, it becomes obvious that these teams play in ""vanilla"" conferences.  The Big XII might have rivaled the SEC a couple of years ago, but those days are a distant memory.  Nebraska is terrible this year, Colorado is always piss-poor.  Texas was decent this year and so was A&M (Fran still can't beat Bobby Stoops and probably never will), but in all honesty, if they played a Georgia or LSU, they would lose.  Then there's the Pac-10, which is probably the weakest conference in the nation.  Seriously, who is in the Pac-10?  Washington, Washington St., Oregon?  USC aside, Cal might be the only other decent team in that conference.  I suppose the only other conference I would associate with the SEC would be the ACC, which is well on its way to becoming arguably the toughest conference in America.

On a similar note, I would have liked to have seen Auburn win a national championship.  Then maybe they'd understand what it means to win 12.  Maybe it would put a stop to all the whining about that's all Alabama fans talk about because they would finally understand.  

But alas, the cruel reality is setting in.  Auburn will not play for the national championship - they will be left out of the dance.  And somehow this seems like karma for a school that was on the verge of firing their now beloved coach in a way that definitely showed a lack of couth.  The real cruelty of this season will come when Auburn has won the Sugar Bowl handily.  Tommy Tuberville is already searching for some new digs, and he will be gone by next year to a job that offers him more money with Al Borges in tow, because who can really have allegiance to a school that tried to screw him over, then turns around and hails him as a god?"

So, its official.  Colorado is definitely cold.  Last night the temperature at my apartment read -20F outside.  I suppose the truly scary thing is that we are only in December, so this is only the beginning.  Yikes.  So I have had to find things to do to keep warm.  I went skiing with my pops the other day as he has been for the week visiting and that kept me pretty warm.  And I have been going to my favorite pub out here about twice a week to warm up with some Irish whiskey with my Irish friend.  Good times.

On another note, I finished my JET application and hopefully got it in on time.  I suppose we'll see where that takes me.  My dad asked me what I planned on doing if I didn't get accepted - to which my reply was the typical, ""I don't know.""  I guess I'll worry about that when and if it happens.  I suppose there's alot of unknowns in my life right now.  About a year ago I would be having a nervous breakdown at the thought of this, but now I am pretty content with it.  You really can't plan anything because its likely that your plans will go straight to crap anyway.  Day to day living is alot more fun, at least at this point of my life.  I think I might just be a travel bum for as long as possible :)"

Its been snowing here for almost the past 36 hours.  Its amazing outside.  There was enough snow on the roads last night to affect the way my steering wheel turned - like you could get in the ruts that the cars ahead of you had made and not have to worry about steering because the snow acted as a guide.  I guess I am getting worried because I am doing alot of snow driving now and I feel like I am getting too comfortable for my own good.  The only reason I was driving around in it last night was because a group of coworkers and I had gone out for some night snowboarding.  I think it was my 17th day of riding this year, which I think is pretty darn impressive.

Thus, no Orange Bowl and no national championship.  You had a great team this year...a really great team.  In fact, you had a pretty darn good team last season, too.  But you also have a head coach who falls in the category of mediocre.  Coincidentily, this is how you will describe your season - mediocre."

I have no problem admitting that Auburn has a good football team this year.  In fact, they have a great football team.  However, I thought I might offer up a little food for thought for you Barners out there:  Even if Auburn somehow gets into the national championship game, and even if they win that game, you will have ONE (1) national championship.  If my math is correct (and I know it is because I am half-asian), you Barners have a long way to go.  Next time you decide to berate me with your petty insults perhaps you should bring a more legitimate criticism with you.

It was good times going 100 mph.  I finished ""Blue Like Jazz"" for the second time today.

I think I have been avoiding my livejournal, not because there has been nothing to say, but because I just don't know how to put into words how I have been feeling lately.  I have been in ""bad form"" for the past couple of days as my Irish friend Jen would say.  And she called me out on it last night - I am glad she did, though.  Sometimes you need a friend to tell you to stop being gay and get over yourself.  I think Jen and I will be friends for a long time to come.  

This morning I woke up in ""good form"" and had a lovely workout at the gym.  But when I got to work my attitude went straight to crap.  And I have no explanation for it other than me being lonely.  That basically sums it up - I am just flat out lonely on this planet from time to time.  I'd really like to be able to say that I have God and thats sufficient, but that would be a lie.  On the other hand, I am glad that I am not in a relationship because I am selfish and would end up hurting someone in the end.  I guess thats a roundabout way of saying I suck at life.

It snowed about 10 inches over Tuesday and Wednesday which made all the trees white and romantic.  I don't think I'll ever get tired of seeing that.  All the snow made for a good opening day at Keystone Resort, which is the resort I live by.  So I hiked over there this morning before work and go some snowboarding in (my 7th day for those keeping up with the running tab).  It was definitely nice to be able to take a run that lasted more than 30 seconds, which was what I was dealing with over at A-Basin (I say this like any of you actually give a rip).

I spent the majority of the past two weeks gathering all kinds of information, references, etc. for the JET Program application.  Hopefully I will get all of this in before the December 1 deadline and hopefully I will get accepted and get to go back to the motherland.

Work has been going well.  I haven't had to start until 11 for the past two weeks, which is pretty nice because I can wake up and do any number of things to start my day.  I am not incredibly good at my sales job, but I suppose I do alright.  I am basically just getting by on my base pay right now, so I am really looking forward to receiving some commission checks.  The reason I am broke is because I bought a new snowboard <a href=""http://www.romesnowboards.com/""></a>  (Again, I am sure y'all care).

Tonight I am heading over to Vail for dinner and free drinks.  I will head back and go snowboarding again at Keystone around 12 a.m. because they are having some celebration where they keep the lifts open for 36 hours straight.  I am not snowboarding this late because I am that hungry to snowboard, but rather I am doing it for the novelty.  Pray that I don't kill myself so I can watch Alabama beat LSU tomorrow.

This passage struck me as wonderful:

Rick says that I will love God because he first loved me.  I will obey God because I love God.  But if I cannot accept God's love, I cannot love Him in return, and I cannot obey Him.  Self-discipline will never make us feel righteous or clean; accepting God's love will.  The ability to accept God's unconditional grace and ferocious love is all the fuel we need to obey Him in return.  Accepting God's kindness and free love is something the devil does not want us to do.  If we hear, in our inner ear, a voice saying we are failures, we are losers, we will never amount to anything, this is the voice of Satan trying to convince the bride that the groom does not love her.  This is not the voice of God.  God woos us with kindness, He changes our character with the passion of His love.

We dream of Christ's love for His bride reading like Romeo and Juliet; two equals enflamed in liberal love.  I think it is more like Lucentio's pursuit of Bianca in The Taming of the Shrew.  That is, the groom endearing the belligerent bride with kindness, patience, and love.

Our ""behavior"" will not be changed long with self-discipline, but fall in love and a human will accomplish what he never thought possible.  The laziest of men will swim the English channel to win his woman.  I think what Rick said is worth repeating that by accepting God's love for us, we fall in love with Him, and only then do we have the fuel we need to obey.

In exchange for our humility and willingness to accept the charity of God, we are given a kingdom.  And a beggar's kingdom is better than a proud man's delusion."

Somewhere, somehow, the light has gone out - the flame has died.  It has left me feeling very confused because I know that all Christians go through dry spells, but this has been the longest.  I am to the point of feeling like I have been abandoned by God.  I feel like all my trying is pointless - like I am stranded on top of a mountain.  I have no way out, there's nothing I can do but wait to be rescued.  Or I could just give up and die.  So I feel like I am waiting, fighting off the negative thoughts of not being saved...

This isn't to say I haven't lost my faith or anything.  I still believe that Jesus was in fact God as a man and that He died for me.  I just hate living a fruitless life.  I mean, as much fun as snowboarding is, its really not bringing God too much glory."

I am glad I decided against that because I saw that Wolf Blitzer was up at 4 a.m. saying the election was still to close to call and looking very pleased to be there.  I sat in front of the T.V. with my bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch wanting to believe that it was in the bag for Dubya, but it was the same feeling I got watching the Red Sox:  You want to believe they are going to win, but in the back of your mind you feel like something, anything, could go wrong.

I really couldn't handle the thought of Kerry being the leader of the free world so I went snowboarding (Running count:  5 days) with Aussie Ryan.  We met our friends Gemma and Paul out there and got about 3 runs in - I wish I could have stayed out there all day because it was just flat out gorgeous.  I've only recently wrapped my head around what I am getting to do...its amazing to be able to enjoy God's creation.  My enjoyment of His creation turns into pleasure for God.  And His creation brings glory to His name.

When I got home it was announced that Kerry had conceded to Bush and I found that to be quite respectable in the wake of the last election's debacle.  I thought that if I had run for president and lost, I wouldn't cry like a baby and demand all kinds of recounts, I would rather just take it like a man and be gracious in defeat.  I have no problem admitting that I am bit surprised at the results of the election with all the negative media coverage Bush seemed to be receiving up to the election.  I guess its all we heard because the only people that have a microphone to rant through are celebrities...a minority, regardless of what they might believe.

On a similar note, I found the whole MTV/P-Diddy ""Vote or Die"" campaign to be such a farce.  Personally, Mr. Diddy, I would rather not have uninformed 18 year-olds voting because of what I said above.  I would venture to say that the majority of the 18-22 year old demographic in the U.S. is rather uninformed about politics and would rather do what their favorite celebrities find trendy at the time.  This is not to say that I am well-versed in today's political world, but it does mean that I voted based on my morals, beliefs, and research into the subject.  

People may complain about the President of the United States, but what we really need to do is address the problems in ourselves.  The president doesn't tell us how to act...its our place to decide how we will change the world.  And changing the world starts with changing ourselves.  There are lots of people who complain about this war, but I guarantee you that the thought doesn't keep them up at night.  I admit that I live in a happy little bubble, one that isn't consumed with thoughts of OUR soldiers fighting for the freedom of the Iraqi people, and that needs to change.  One thing that has changed for me is my appreciation of this great country.  It may have its flaws, but in my travels I have found that it doesn't get any better.  I say to those who have beef with this country and its President the same thing that was said to me when I ""hated"" the U.S. in high school - ""If you don't like it, you have the freedom to move somewhere else."""

Today has been pretty hellish at work.  I hate computers sometimes.  Although my work computer has allowed me to check up on the presidential election (which hasnt shown much progress yet).

Sometime I think the hardcore right would rather enjoy seeing Senator Kerry being elected.  Seriously, they would eat Kerry alive at every little error he makes.

Saturday was a good 23rd birthday, although it feels a bit odd to be 23.  I am comforted, however, by my coworkers.  I would say their average age is about 28 and they are still on the ""I am not ready for a real job yet"" kick.  So I guess I have a few more years to go before my parents should start worrying.

I had an urge to go snowboarding on my birthday, but two things kept me from the slopes:  1) the crowds that would be at A-Basin on a Saturday after fresh snowfall, 2) and the pile of laundry looming in my room.  So, yes, on my birthday I was pseudo-responsible and did some laundry.  I then went to the gym for a nice workout - the gym that I am a member of here is super nice, especially since its only 30 bucks a month.  I sat around for the rest of the day, then went to a party my friends were throwing myself and my Aussie friend, Gemma, who's birthday was the day before mine.  It was a thrift store prom theme party, and it was definitely good times.  We went to some nightclub afterward that reeked of smelly feet.  The DJ also kinda sucked, but we overcame and had a blast.

Sunday I headed to church and took my Scottish friend with me.  The service was a bit ho-hum until this violinist girl played the offeratory music.  It was amazing!  We had a good chat afterwards, which was an added bonus.  I watched a bunch of football in the afternnon and bought some new snowboard goggles as a treat for myself.  Last night I joined my church's choir and we are going to be performing a little Christmas deal in the near future.  I had such a good time singing harmonies rather than just straight up...its so much harder, but all that much more beautiful.  Its been a weird time spiritually for me and singing definitely reminds me of how glorious God is.  If you have a moment to offer up a prayer for me, I would really appreciate it.  I am just looking for some resolve, some understanding.  I really just need to get down on my hands and knees and beg, knowing that the Lord will give me peace.

P.S. I also watched my favorite movie last night, The Big Lebowski.  I have seen it probably 20 times and it still makes my sides hurt.  

P.P.S.  If you haven't read what MattCrash blogged the other day, its brilliant and I would encourage you all read it.  <a href=""http://mattcrash.blogspot.com"">"

"event","Alright.  Its 5:45 and I still have about an hour to go at work.  I guess I shouldn't complain, though, seeing as how I am able to update my livejournal at work.  That's right America, I am getting paid to put my thoughts into cyberspace.

Last night was another great night of karaoke at the local Mexican restaurant, Dos Locos.  I was feeling a bit ""ferrell"" as the Aussies would say.  After some researching, I found that this word describes how you would feel if you had tasted civilized living, yet reverted to savagery.  Thats the best I got, but for some reason it makes sense to me, so hopefully it will make sense to you.  The ferrell feeling vanished when I got a cold Bud Light in my hand and my good buddy Michael Black from Dundee, Scotland rolled in.  We did a rousing rendition of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" (to which he knows all the words to), and then we performed ""You've Lost That Loving Feeling"" as an encore.  It was definitely a good time.  The night did end on a bit of a sour note as I was woken up by my suitemate's freeloader boyfriend who was vomiting in my toilet.  Oh the joy.  I think that was the final straw - I am pretty sure I will be moving to a nice locale over the weekend.  I decided that paying the extra $100 rent was worthwhile.

This morning I awoke to fresh snow on the ground and the ski report saying that there were 3 inches of new snow at A-Basin.  So I called up Ryan and Belle (the Aussies) and we got some turns in before we had to be in at work at 11.  That was incredible...its hard to beat snowboarding before you go into work, although it makes work a total bummer for the rest of the day.  Its definitely a tough life in Keystone, Colorado.

Hope things are well where you are.  Peace!"

I get to travel around Vail and Beaver Creek Resorts.  I also get to stay in the posh condos in the area for free whenever I get a free chance.  Its a tough life.

Last night I stayed in Vail with some of my coworkers.  We cooked a nice dinner and chatted and it was just cool to get to know the people I will spending the next couple of months with better.  I had a tasty new beer while on this excursion as well.  The little microbreweries out here make some darn good stuff.  And of course, the staple whiskey was on hand for a little nightcap action :)

I am thinking that I will be finding new living quarters soon, since I have realized that my suitemate is a pathological liar with a boyfriend who is apparently wanted by the law for skipping out on rent for 2 months at the place I am living - yet he is still living there.  I am not one to rat people out, but its a bit unfair when I am struggling to make ends meet, and there is some dude freeloading.  It also doesn't help that he ate some of my food, which made me incredibly bitter.  I met a girl from Alabama today who is a die-hard Bama fan and she was looking for a roommate, so I might try to do that...she already lives close to alot of my other friends here, so it may just work out.

Anyway, this weekend ought to be great fun, seeing as how its my birthday and Halloween.  Some of my friends are throwing me and an Aussie girl who's birthday is tomorrow a joint party.  We are supposed to get tacky crap from the thrift store and have a dance.  It should be alot of fun.  Hopefully I will get some pictures from it and post them.  Oh and I am going snowboarding in the morning, which will rule.  

Take care"

It feels good to be back in Colorado, which is a significant turn around of emotions compared to this summer when all I wanted to do was to get out of Miami and never go back.  This isn't to say that I didn't have a lovely weekend back in Birmingham.  I am confident in saying that Birmingham will always be my home, no matter where my life takes me.

Jason and Sami's wedding was beautiful and most definitely a good time.  Jason's gotta be one of the coolest people I have ever met.  It was wonderful to see some old friends, as well.  And everyone (excluding myself) looked fantastic:

It was also nice to go back to Greystone to kick it with the family and the d-o-g.  Lauren was nice enough to let me borrow her whip, so disaster was avoided there.  I also had a great birthday supper with mom and pops and Lauren - that was really fun and surprisingly civil :) I also got to roll with some of my best friends in the world - I could be doing manual labor in a field with those kids and still have the time of my life.  I am really glad we got to do that since I am not sure when the next time I will be afforded that pleasure. 

Okay well time to get back to working.  I hope things are as good where you are as they are here...snow tonight baby!!!"

1.  I am flying home today for Jason and Sami's wedding.  It should be a good time.  
2.  My birthday is October 30th.  Mark it, dude.
3.  Its not snowing right now, which is sad.
4.  I am so proud of the Red Sox...I hate NY so much and am so glad that all those annoying Yankees were shutup by my hero, JOHNNY DAMON!

Okay, I think that's it.  

And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.
And he said:
Your children are not your children.  They are sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.
They come through you but not from you, and though they are with you yet they belong not to you.
You may give them your love but not your thoughts, for they have their own thoughts.
You may house their bodies but not their souls, for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,
which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.  
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
Let your bending in the Archer's hand be for gladness; for even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable."

"event","Then said Almitra, ""Speak to us of Love."" 
And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said: 
When love beckons to you follow him, 
Though his ways are hard and steep. 
And when his wings enfold you yield to him, 
Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. 
And when he speaks to you believe in him, 
Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden. 
For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. 
Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, 
So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. 
Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself. 
He threshes you to make you naked. 
He sifts you to free you from your husks. 
He grinds you to whiteness. 
He kneads you until you are pliant; 
And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast. 
All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart. 
But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure, 
Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor, 
Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears. 
Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. 
Love possesses not nor would it be possessed; 
For love is sufficient unto love. 
When you love you should not say, ""God is in my heart,"" but rather, I am in the heart of God."" 
And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course. 
Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself. 
But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: 
To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night. 
To know the pain of too much tenderness. 
To be wounded by your own understanding of love; 
And to bleed willingly and joyfully. 
To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving; 
To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy; 
To return home at eventide with gratitude; 
And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.

I trust that everyone had a good weekend.  Mine was relaxing, so that was excellent.  Saturday we went in search of snow again, but alas we were blanked this time around.  Which turned out to be fine with me because I really didn't want to hike a couple thousand vertical feet.  Saturday night we grabbed some dinner at a great local brewery and then sat around and watch Ole Miss lose to Tennessee - boo hiss.  On a more positive note, however, at least Alabama came through with a victory.  Now if we can figure out a way to beat the Viles and Fat Phil this weekend and Auburn later on in the season.  How great would it be if they came to UA undefeated and we just knocked them off their horse?  Hey, a boy can dream right?

Yesterday I went to church at this awesome little community church - it was very Colorado.  I say that because the pastor did double duty by playing the guitar in the worship service and then giving the sermon.  Oh and the assistant pastor played the bongos.  It was actually a really good service and I will definitely be going back.  Actually, I think I am gonna try to sing in the Christmas thingy they have there.  It should be a good time.  Last night we had a little pot luck dinner type thing at my friend's apartment, which was a blast.  I am really blessed with some crazy coworkers.

This morning I got up early, watched the little bits of snow that were falling and put the radio on loud.  It was awesome.  I had a temporary brain fart that caused me to forget how awesome Shane Barnard is.  Thankfully I put that in my portable CD player for the walk to the office this morning.  It was pretty awesome to look at the mountains and sing some praises to the Almighty God!  ""The Lord is gracious and, slow to anger He is, rich in love He is, good to all!""

So this morning I awoke to about 6 inches of snow on the ground and I promise you that I did a little dance by my bed.  Its so gorgeous outside!  It was still snowing a bit when I hopped in the shower - and when I got out it was snowing the big, pretty flakes.  So I propped my chair in front of the window and had my quiet time.  Nature truly shows us God's beauty and love for us...I am thankful that He loves to see me smile about His creations :)

On another note, Arapahoe Basin (a ski area right up the road from me) is shooting for a October 17th opening day.  So in about a week I will be getting some snowboarding in, although I think that this opening date is a bit ambitious.  We shall see.

This is the first time I have been able to access the Internet in about a week.  It's weird how much you rely on the Internet and you don't realize it until you are without it for an extended period of time, say a whole week.  Anyway, as a dedicated LJ user, one of the first things I felt the need to do with my renewed Internet experience was to give you a quick update.

Things are great in Colorado...I don't think I could be more blessed.  The weather has been nothing short of spectacular - I have hiked to some snow for some early season turns and yesterday I took a hike around the beautiful lake in my town.  My coworkers are amazing - I am the only American in my training class.  My class consists of 3 Aussies, a Russian, a Brazilian, an Irish girl, and a Scotsman.  They are just infinitely fascinating and have traveled so much and have just the most amazing stories to tell.  I feel that I will learn alot from them.

Alright, well I know this is short but sweet, but I hope things are well in your neck of the woods.  Come visit me!  WOOOOO"

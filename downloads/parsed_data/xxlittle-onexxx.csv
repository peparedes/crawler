"event","Right, today was very reasonable . . . 

AM: investigative stations - two happy, jolly examiners, one of whom had a habit of saying: ""Now your doing very well, can you tell me . . . ""
5 lovely cases - lipoma of the forearm, aneurysmal bone cyst of the spine, Blount's disease in a kiddie, osteochondritis dissecans of the knee in a 15 year old, and Paget's sarcoma. Happy after this . . . I even got some bonus trickier questions . . . and got them right :) Most people felt happy after this station. All good solid cases we se everyday . . . 

PM: Operations II. Two interesting examiners, one guy started off a little cranky, but warmed a little as I kept talking.
1. Second toe deformity with a bunion
2. Flexor tendon injury of the index finger - how to repair
3. Bilateral DDH and previous VDRO - issues for a hip replacement (YES!!!! Like manna from heaven - I can talk about this all day)
4. Calcaneal fracture - how to fix (done a couple of these myself lately, so straightforward)
5. Grade III AC joint dislocation - Weaver-Dunn procedure; Never done this and they probably guessed it . . . described the textbook procedure, and got stuck with a tricky question anout the graft at the end when the bell rang.

We amble on to the local pub for a quick drink, then Joe, Daniel and his wife and I had a nice quiet dinner, followed by ""Star Trek"" at the cinema. Good movie, then again I'm a fan and would have found it great regardless.

I feel strangely calm, and since there's nothing I can do about the results for another 12 hours, I'm going off to watch some TV.

Presentation time tomorrow (today!) at 12:15pm.

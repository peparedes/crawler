"event","I think I woke up a lot worse.  I know I was confused.  He climbed up to me and said, ""No, you're right.""  That was a dream though I think because I heard the bathroom door shut.  

I sat on the patio for about ten minutes.  Obnoxious heat, don't look at me.  I've forgotten how to speak.  

I feel like a child though.  I slammed the door didn't I..  I didn't mean to.  I want to say I'm sorry a million times.  If you could look at me and just say stay for some other reason beyond convenience.  I don't mean love, just not convenience.  Would that you had actually persued anything for a reason beyond that.  

And you said it opened up the opportunity for you to persue anything.  You wouldn't have done it otherwise.  I want to roll again.  Before I move, because if I could just express..  Maybe it would make more sense.  Maybe then I could lose."

"event","I drank margaritas and pina coladas last night and played my guitar until I fell asleep.
I wake up.  There's so much sound going through my head, I'm swooning from it.  Dreams aren't even so much disturbing as usually so often they can be.  Not that they were any different, actually some more engrossing than frequently and yet I feel almost refreshed.  

There's this hunger inside me that's growing.  That sound, like before the war, that anticipation feeling at the beginning..  Soft drums rolling off the hills in the back as it's growing.  Like the sweat dripping off their wrists and they don't tremble; the awaited battle draws close.  

That sound, that penetrating echoed roll under your feet of vibration.  Don't fade, it's always the best part.  Bloody rapture that follows still never compares to the anticipation.  Perhaps this is my reason for obsession.  My favorite part of the story.  

I am obsessed with obsession.  Only it's destined for defeat.  No one ever wins you know.  No, because heroes don't play a part in this procession.  Only sweat and that familiar, yet always foreign vibration."

"event","Yes, I haven't made any entries consisting of actual sentences.  Lack of desire to really speak the past few days.  But I'm back, probably.  
    
I've been contemplating joining the air force within the next few months here.  My GED results should come in a couple of weeks which would enable me to do so.  Now I can actually be myself and not a downer worried about testing and sleep and work and all.  
    
I'm unsure about a lot of things right now.  I don't actually want to join the military but my options are somewhat questionable.  Music remains my sole first priority.  Only I wonder that I'm the only one as interested.  Probably I worry too much but certain things happen that make me wonder.  I'm going to attempt at not thinking about it and just seeing what happens.  
    
I'm single now I think, seeing as how I haven't talked to the chick in about two weeks.  I have a hard time thinking it was ever anything anyway.  I get my hopes up for people to actually be decent."

"event","vintage images of me lying dead
between dishonor disbelief the wasted
it doesn't seem to quite fall together
mirrored images of unsaid 
why am I watching this instead
no advise or spiritual wander 
in a picture of myself on the bed
stones all around and ungratefully
crumbled glass of this written identity
reflections and tripled meaningless
crippled vision lightening the incision
drawn to the familiarity of insincerity"

confessions lust
and bleeding fingers 
clutching dust
intentions glory chains
this misery all to 
enigmatic misplaced trust
dream- it's worn temptations
plead- it's silent situation
dead- sparks of intrigue 
it left, this news
this settling restlessness
you wept, 
come climb inside my emptiness"

"event","ok so friday night i went to don pablos with kristina which was real fun! wooo lol we go there too much haha but we love it..so i came home did some stuff then went to bed for the state cup staurday. so everyone met at the perry hall bowling alley in that little shopping center and we carpooled with deanna! woo! lol we ate a lot of pretzels lol and i sang very lovely..heh and talked and laughed a lot, but i forget about what lol but it was fun..so we get there an hour before the game so we practiced for an hour lol then deanna, jess, and i got into the triangle and started passing and a guy with these all red shoes walked by and jess was like i like your shoes!! lol so he was like thanks... and once he left jess like did that little gag thing haha god jess! if you dont have something nice to say, dont say it at all! lol so then out of no where shes like omg he looks like a clown! so deanna and i start cracking up haha cuz his shoes were like gold !! haha and he had like red wavy hair lol soo funny and the game before went into overtime and then into pks so we sat through that too which was fun to watch cuz you could see that the other team had better skill and all and the one team's goalie didnt even try to get the ball rolling on the ground into the corner..it was kinda pathetic cuz i mean she couldve at least tried! well anyway we started and holy crap these girls have skilll lol the CSA hornets i think it was..but i mean they were division 1 wags so we played really good but mr terry says we could be like division 3 or something so they won. it wasnt bad though. we played really good. mr terry said if we play this hard in the league we'll definetely win all our games. cuz we lost our last two games and havent been playing as hard..the score was 4-1..the one goal linds was in goal and they made a shot but it was on the ground.. not really fast or ne thing. and linds goes to pick it up and it rolls right through her hands. i felt soo bad for her.. but it was kinda funny.. heh..lol but it was really fun..they had this skilled player sammy and she got carded!! haha but just yellow cuz she was pushing a lot with amanda then she got all mad and yelled at manda and the ref and it was amusing..i wanted to hit her though lol but our goal was soo awesome lol cuz sam's awesome at soccer like that lol its true..but yeah you can look at d's lj to see it if you want..
so then we went to leave and we were hungry so of course our parents get lost haha fun times! so then we happen to be right on my dad's house road!! lol that was awesome lol that road is called prefferkorn or something like that haha and im like thats his house!!!! haha im such a loser lol so we finally got home and went to silver spring..yum yum!! and deanna saw some lady teacher so she talked to her and then our little blinky buzzer thing went off and it wasnt vibrating yet so i thought deanna broke it lol but she didnt..so then that guy got deanna and i shirley temples..yumm but i mean who cares who gets more cherries right?! lol and i wouldnt try that food haha im sucha wimp lol so then all of a sudden deanna's like awww! and our parents like both turn around lol and d starts cracking up lol it was soo funny..they looked like twins!! haha and deanna's mom and my mom were funny and my mom said shes never been so entertained at dinner..haha so then deanna asked if i wanted to spend the night and i said well duhhh lol not really but i did say yes lol so i went home and got a shower and came over..lol we got online then ate some apple pie yummm lol and watched she gets what she wants haha i love that bonjour yall heh it makes me laugh lol but the movie was kinda corny excpet the little boy was amusing. so then we had to take natalie out and we kept hearing something and natalie wouldnt do her business!!! haha funny funny so we were just standing there and talking for a while lol like we need to see a scary movie with the guys omg thatd be so much fun! lol so then we went to bed oh and we attacked each other with highlighters lol fun fun haha and then deanna started whispering so i was like wth?! lol and i was freaking out cuz the room kept getting dark then light then dark then light lol so deanna told me to shut my eyes haha so we got up and i ate cinnamon life..holy frick that stuffs good! lol so i got more and deanna was gonna pour milk in my cereal cuz i didnt want any that time so i was like NO! haha so then i was like whoa i sounded like a ninja! lol good times so then we got dressed and went to the mall where deannas mom got me a shirt thank youu!! it matches deanna! woohoo hehe so deanna was looking at the purses and shes like its (how ever much money) mom..and shes like deanna, you dont wear purses..so deanna like gives her this look and says so i cant start wearing them ever in my life?! haha it was funny lol so the oc shirt wasnt too boxy lol so we got it..yay!!! haha so we left and were in the car and deanna wanted to see the keychains and my keys and i have this thing you pull out and its if someone or a animal is following you or chasing you and it makes a loud noise to scare them away so deanna was like how do i pull it out?! so im like you pull the whole thing out! haha and it was soo loud in the car lol jesus!! haha deanna started laughing so hard and said it was fun haha loser jkk lol good times..i love you deanna! so many good times to come!!

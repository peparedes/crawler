"event","ive been thinking. 
 -wow thats a new one
 im starting to miss the way we all used to hang out
 when i went to shasta, we always hung out during lunch
  from playing guitars in highways, to fixing drama, we always had somthing to do
 hanging out after school
 all that good stuff you know
 and it really gets to me, cause we all used to be soo fucking close
 some of us more then others, but we all seemed to get along, like a family
 
 its all really starting to get to me cause i look back and i was so happy and everyone else is too well most of the times anyways
 i miss all the good times, i miss sneeking off campus to go smoke pot at the river trail
 i miss all my freinds i had, and lost when i got kicked out
 i miss hanging out with manda during p.e and just talking about life with her
 i miss getting excited just so i could see chelsea in between periods
 i miss getting detention in math every day for absoluty no reason except i wouldnt stop talking to annie
 i miss doing all the shit that we did when we knew we were going to get into trouble but just didnt give a fuck cause we were all having fun TOGETHER
  and i miss ALL the good times weve had together
 i just wish i could have gone back and fixed it to where we never fell apart like we are now
 id do anything to have that life back
 and its sad to know that it most likely is never going to happen

"event","dyed my hair red yeaterday, looks pretty cool, i met this girl yesterday, and i really like her, might ask her out if i get to know her; and if i have the balls to do it, its been six months since my last girlfreind, and it really hasnt been that bad, im just getting sick of being alone all the time.
tonight i went to the dip even though my mom told me i couldnt,fuck her i dont like her, we held up a sign and made five bucks, two waters, and a bag of corn nutts spent the money at mc.donelds, cause we were really hungry, met some chick that works there and she gave us even more food, shes awsome, all though i didnt get her name. yeah nothing special, just one of my average days.

love you chelsea and amanda, and everyone else too

"event","yesterday i hung out with mud and skip, we got attacked by hippies, and on our way out of the park a bum shouted   

""Luke skywalker is goign to be here in a couple minutes, hes goign to KILL bush!"" - DR.Bum

no one has left me anything on myspace, so im starting to right in this thing again, fucking shane screwed up again, fucking my mom found out that we stole the jim beam from his house, and shane left some pot , and then my mom called davids mom and his mom ratted me out for smoking pot and smoking, and she told her that i had a 40 of miller hidden in my room and that was like 3 months ago, im so fucking pissed.

i got in a argument with my mom about religion and i told her that i dont have to beleive in what she believed, and i dont really remember what was said after that but basickly she said that she can practise her religion and i cant practise mine if its not the same as hers, and i told her stright up that that's bullshit, and then i threw some stupid ps2 steering wheel control.

last night me and skip got a space bag, wow i was drunk, good times.

i cant tell if people are starting not to like me or what, lately everyone hasnt been talking to me much but im ok with that as long as no ones mad at me, so if anyone is lemme know.

ive decided that im giving up on girls and shit like that, well not really giving up, im just not goign to try anymore, cause whenever i do it always blows up in my face. i always get over it, but i figured if i dont have a chance why try?

it was cool that i saw manda at marketfest, we played with a dead bird.

EVERYONE LEAVE A MESSEGE ON MYSPACE-

"event","Its weird, no matter how hard i try to convince myself that im happy alone , i know deep inside that im not.  i never know what i want, its an indescribable feeling, i wish that somehow i knew how to deal with myself but there isnt.                                   
 
      its funny cause im writing this down thinking that ""maybe someone has advice"" or somthing like that. 

      But i know that no one can fix my emptyness, the hole inside of me, there is no way to fill it so i will eventually have to get over it, but its already been this long so maybe i wont get over it, maybe ill have this hole forever. 
i dont know its very depressing and im sick of being depressed over the same fucking thing , its stupid and rediculous, completley absurd..............wtf am i writing this down for??! no one cares -im out

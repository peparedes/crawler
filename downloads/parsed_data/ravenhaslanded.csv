Working hard painting my ornaments that I give as gifts each year and as usual running out of time...can't mess with tradition! ;)
Feeling kinda blah cause I can't be with one of my friends right now. Her husbands father past away and I wish I could give her a huge hug!

Happier note, 2 friends I lost touch with a year ago came looking for me at my store. There expecting there second child and there's a card on its way to my old address with a pic of their son. I'm hoping someone will be nice enough to leave it by the mail boxes for me. Seeing them made me feel so happy, I was feeling a little under the weather when I sent out my cards I'd lost there address when I moved the first time. :( But now we're back in touch and I plan to keep it that way! :)

Jen practically shoved me out the door cause I was afraid to leave her on her own in fear of not finding anyone to replace me. She told me no worries she'd be fine and to go home and get some rest! She's so awesome I'm so glad I got the chance to work with her!

I also got good news before I left from my District manager. She heard I wasn't feeling well and decided to call me before I left with news of our past mystery shop. We got 80% and it was either myself or Jen that got shopped. I was so relieved and happy to hear that, I've been so worried about our results and at least now I can finally relax about it.

You hide insane . You believe that you people are to blame for everything and though thats technically right its not all. People stay away from you because they fear you. You scare people and you know and love it. You think that the world is just one big hell and it needs to end. You want people to see it too. They lable you as crazy. But what do they know. People do not believe you and hardly ever come near you. It saddens you that they would hurt you. You believe that you deserve this. That you've done something wrong. You probably hate yourself.You may hear voices or see things or even be able to sense things before they happen(I can do that sometimes) and for that they label you crazy and scary. But they just can't understand you. You are special and very cool. Don't let anyone say differently. Just becuase they don't understand you they ignore you. But one day someone will come along and be your friend they will understand you. I know they will come. Hopefully things get better"

Well at least I had a good day working for a bit in their store and I got a chance to have a chat with Jemstar before she started work. :) So all in all it wasn't so bad!  

Some changes are happening in my store next week, I am finally getting an assistant manager! I'm happy but nervous at the same time. Happy cause I need the help with Christmas and nervous on whether or not we'll get along. My boss says she is very nice and is a hard worker and with great customer service and she feels we'll get along great but even with her reassuring words I still can't help but be nervous. *Sighs* Oh well! With this change I am losing one of my girls though, I like her very much but it will be better for me in the long run. She has gotten rather lazy lately and her work ethics tend to suck and that is not someone I need on my team.

Christmas hours are starting as of the 5th of November and I'm not looking forward to them. The mall is repeating the same hours as last year and they obviously did not learn from their past mistake when there was no one in the mall before 9am and no one after 9pm. but still they set the same hours. *rolls eyes* It's all do to Sears being open early, because of them they feel the rest of the mall should open when they do. Well that's fine and dandy for Sears they are able to pull in the sales that early with there specials but as for the rest of the mall it's a ghost town. Oh well not much I can do about that.

Well at least I got away for the weekend before the Christmas rush starts. I had such an awesome time in Toronto and found the North Bound show very interesting and hope to go again next year!"

"event","I recently chose to try and reinstate a friendship that I myself had ended. It was so weird like we never had stopped talking so I'm thinking this is a good sign. His girlfriend I know hates me but the feeling I can assure you is quite mutual. I had ended our friendship mostly because of her behavior towards me but I feel now that I may have given up to easily and throwing someone out of my life because his girlfriend doesn't like me now seems rather silly. I told him in response to him saying she hates me that that is her problem and that I still would like our friendship no matter what she thinks.
I know it will not be easy for him if we do become friends again as she will most definitely give him a hard time about it and I know it will restart her childish behavior yet again towards me but I am willing to put up and ignore her because friends do that. Now I did tell him that if he chooses not to then I will understand and respect his decision. I may not agree with it knowing he is doing it to keep her happy but when you love someone you'll do anything even if it means letting go of someone else you care about. I will except it though because I really don't want him to have to deal with her B.S again. 
It doesn't really sound fare to me though considering if she loves him she would do anything for him even if it means him being friends with someone she hates.
Any rate now I await the decision *sighs*....not much else I can do."

I drempt I was at home and some guys were breaking in. I ran into my room and locked the door and tried desperately to call for help but as I reached someone the line went dead. I sat silent for a moment paralyzed by fear  listening to where the intruders may be. Then a huge thud at my bedroom door and it started to break then a voice shouting we know you're in there prepare to die Bitch. Now tears streaming down my face I made for my window and managed to climb to my balcony just as my door gave way. I then climbed over the side of my balcony and some how swung myself to the one below me as gun shots rang out. I pounded franticly on the windows screaming for who ever would hear me. Finally a face appeared and opened the window and helped me inside then asking why I was there and what was going on? I told them and said we need to call 911! They just smiled an eerie unwelcoming grin and said don't you worry I'll take care of you! Now a new fear arising I tried to run but to no avail, the guy tackled me flipped me over and thats when I felt the knife and screamed...."

"event","""Anxiety""

I feel like I wanna smack somebody
Turn around and bitch slap somebody
But I ain't goin' out bro (no, no, no)
I ain't givin' into it (no, no, no)
Anxieties bash my mind in
Terrorizing my soul like Bin Laden
But I ain't fallin' down bro (no, no, no)
I won't lose control bro (no, no, no)
Shackle and chained
My soul feels stained
I can't explain got an ich on my brain
Lately my whole aim is to maintain
And regain control of my mainframe
My bloods boiling its beatin' out propaine
My train of thoughts more like a runaway train
I'm in a fast car drivin' in a fast lane
In the rain and I'm might just hydroplaine

I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from Uzi's
I've been dealing with something thats worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and thats the
The anxiety the sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety

My head keeps running away my brother
The only thing making me stay my brother
But I won't give into it bro (no, no, no)
Gotta get myself back now
God, I can't let my mind be 
Tell my enemy is my own
Gots to find my inner wealth
Gots to hold up my thoughts
I can't get caught (no, no, no)
I can't give into it now (no, no, no)
Emotions are trapped set on lock
Got my brain stuck goin through the motions
Only I know what's up
I'm filled up with pain
Tryin' to gain my sanity
Everywhere I turn its a dead end infront of me
With nowhere to go gotta shake this anxiety
Got me feelin' strange paranoia took over me
And its weighin' me down
And I can't run any longer, yo
Knees to the ground

I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from Uzi's
I've been dealing with something thats worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and thats the
The anxiety the sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety"

"event","Well after working everyday this week I was so glad my final day of this was over. Or at least I thought....When I came in to work that day I noticed a ceiling tile was droopy and there was a nice big water mark. I called security and they came to have a look and found no leak but put a bucket in the ceiling where it may have come from just in case....crises adverted or so I thought....At four when I was getting ready to leave another spot in the ceiling was dripping...*GROANS* so called security again.*sigh* They came down and sure enough there's deffinately a leak and I ended up staying till 5;30 waiting for the verdict on whether it was fixable, whether I'd have to stay after close or whether it was our A.C unit and then I have to wait till Monday to call head office to send someone to fix it.*rolls eyes* Apparently its the A.C some how the rain was getting into it and well now dripping into my store, so now I have a hole in my ceiling, have to keep the A.C off and play the waiting game! Oh well despite that I had a good day at work and we all enjoyed having the good looking security guards up in our ceiling. :P
My day ended nicely though I got to spend time with Jemstar and I quite enjoyed myself. It was so nice to finally get out after being cooped up all week and who better to spend it with!! :)"

"event","Well I decided enough was enough and I went to my ex's store this morning and asked when I could get my Play station and he said I could have it right now cause it has been in his back room for the past couple of months. I asked why he had'nt brought it down and he said it was because he just did'nt think about it......Ya right *rolls eyes dramatically* Any who's I finally got it back with out me being nasty and I kept my cool and told him thanks and much appreciated and went on my way.
Oh yeah he also said he liked my hair and I looked good! *rolls eyes again*"

<img

<p align=""left""><br><b>Explanation:</b> This powers speaks pretty<br>much for itself. Though you don't need wings<br>for this power,you can fly anyway. Some people<br>may consider it as telekinesis since they can<br>also fly, but you can't make material things<br>move like they can. This ability could be a<br>relaxing activity when you want to get away<br>from everyday troubles. Also it is good when<br>sneaking upon an enemy since it makes no sound.<br>When going over to the ""dark side""<br>the power could be used to harrass and break<br>into building through windows etc.<br>You are quite similar to this power since you<br>like to have your head in the clouds.<br>Supernatural things amuse while ordinary life<br>does not. If your daydreaming has gotten a<br>little too far you might be zooned out all the<br>time, even when you are having a conversation.<br>Your desires and/or goals tend to be<br>unrealistic even if you know those would<br>probably never happen. Travelling is something<br>you would be interested in doing since seeing<br>exotic scenery fits with your fantasies of<br>escaping your plain life. You can also have<br>some creative ability (writer, playing an<br>instrumen etc) that interests you.<br><b>Negative aspects:</b> The whole reason you<br>may be escaping life could be fear of being let<br>down by it. So if that would come to happen,<br>and an important dream had been crushed you<br>could get depressed.</p>

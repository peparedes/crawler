"event","i believe i figured out why i love the wolves and their howls and the sound of wind and wind in general.  The wolves run in packs which is togetherness which is good to feel as though you are part of something and just not someone who no one cares about.  When one wolf howls any wolf that can hear him/her howls and that also signifies unity.  The wind, well thats a different story entirely, when I feel the wind I feel like i can just go with it where ever it would like to take me.  It's so pure, it also feels like that it can take my life with whatever it is taking its way.  That it will take me to a better place.  I guess i just want someone i can hang with on the weekend hold tight and just have fun with her.

"event","i wish i knew what i was feeling, i stay up while im trying to sleep thinkin about the same thing, it goes through my mind in so many different ways but i come to the same solution over and over again.  I wonder if she's serious but i believe that she is.  I mean shes perfect, shes nice, staight forward with me, and shes very beautiful.  That all might sound a bit corny but oh well thats how i feel dont need to act like someone else all i gotta do is be myself and i should be fine.  I cant wait till i see her this winter it will def be a moment to remember.  Who knows this year might be one of the best years of my life.

"event","well everyone pretty much knows who i am, and what im about... well my freshman year i fell into a huge ass depression and i started being concieted mean to kids and w.e. else to try and make myself feel better but nothing did.  Then after the school year was over when i went up to ohio i was really cocky and did a lot of stupid shit that i regret still to this day, there are certain ways to take out ur depression and mine was and still is anger.  So this past school year my school started making me go to a psycologist so i can have help wit it but he didnt do shit, but the pills did.  Then i started realizing that being like this was ruining me, not lettin me be the person i was known to be or anything i was a huge fukin dick.  I was even mean to a grl during summer of '03 for no reason at all jus b/c i had to take myanger out on someone, then i finally apologized b/c i knew wat i did was wrong and i had to set things right.  Now me and that grl have been pretty damn close and idk she helps me out b/c it seems like someone actually cares when im sure theres plenty of people that care but she doesnt even need to care but she does.  Even though she has her own problems if i ever needed her help shes there and its good to have a person like that around wenever u need to help u.  well anyways im out i dont like this depressing shit it sucks major balls..

hopefully wen i get bak home we'll have a couple more movie nites and jus chill

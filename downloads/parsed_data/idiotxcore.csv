"event","The Crazy Theorys 
1.Technology destroys more than helps 
2.Fear is a meer image of ones self. 
3.Fashion is another way of competition. 
4.Money should have never been, it should have just been trade. 
5.Love is just a chemical in your brain to make sure u reproduce even though all species tend to overpopulate like humans have.(add on on #26) 
6.People make things to make life easier for humans, but usually at another animals expense. 
7.There is more than one person that one person will fall in love with, but only one person u fall in love with will be your true love.
8.There are three worlds with every choice you make. 
9.In this world there are 2 times, mechanical time and body time. 
10.Happiness+evil=the end 
11.Beauty is in everything living or dead, a person can not be beautiful on the outside only within because that is what beauty is. 
12.If there was anarachy there would be less people and with less people I would be able to show everyone how much beauty is in the world. 
13.There is a way to minipulate your dreams. 
14.A bad ass isn't someone who is strong and does dangerous things it's someone who is able to express their feelings openly to anybody who wants to know. 
15.Words are good in a way as it helps us express ourselves but they are bad because they take away more than they give in emotions. 
16.There is so much beauty in the world it's so worth living for. 
17.Everyone has flaws, but those flaws can be made up for in many ways. Also don't be afraid of those flaws.
18.Everyone looks for evil people.The people who don't find the evil, they are the ones that are evil. 
19.There is a person out there that is almost exactly like u in the mind.Some people find these people at a young age and some never find them. 
20.Evil is in everyone.There is a way to get the evil to die.It is something everyone should try to find. 
21.It is amazing how much one person can change everything in your life. 
22.Telepathy is very possible.If 2 brains connect at a certain point they can tell each other everything they are thinking without saying a word.But the problem is at least one of those minds must be in one of the highest states of mind. 
23.Being able to see others thoughts is also very possible.To be able to look into anothers mind and see what they are thinking without them even knowing. 
24.Meditation is a thing that everyone needs to do. To take time out of their lifes and just meditate. It expands the possibilities of your mind. Trust me, I'd know. 
25.Meditation is not the thing where u cross your legs and put your hands on your knees and humm. It is just sittin around, maybe listining to music,(very mellow music that is)and thinking of different things in the crazy world. I recommend that everyone should meditate.
26.(add on to #5) When the 2 chemicals do react the chemical spreads and starts to take over other parts of the brain so that its one of the things u cant stop thinking about, but in the process of the spread it does many other things.  Although this love is just a chemical, there is nothing in the world better than it.
27.Also the love doesn't stop spreading and when the love dies(if it does) it changes the mind in many of ways and then the process starts over again and when it ends (if it does) it leaves different things everytime you fall in love with a different person. 
28.The chemical is like an acid in your brain. It moves around and sinks in and takes parts away and replaces with what it wants. It makes you learn from your mistakes in the love so that you will not have to worry about it later. 
29.Some music can spark different things in the brain. Sometimes it is the music that sparks it, sometimes it is the lyrics. 
30.The only thing in your life you need to start seeing things in the world is an inciting moment. It could be love, the depression love gives you, drugs, or it can even be all three. These are not the only three. There are more i do not know of yet. 
31.The adverage person uses 10% of their brain as an adult. There are people I know now at the age of 14/15 that have that factor doubled. 
32.5% of the mind is used to do common functions with the other parts of the body like walking, running, and writing. The other 95% is used only as a methods that envolve strong use of the brain such as reading a book, learning new things, and telepathy. 
33.Great minds discuss about ideas, adverage minds discuss of events. 
34.Ignorance is not half as big as a problem as not knowing when someone is ignorant. 
35.If people don't like you for who you are then they don't deserve to be around you"

23 

Under 12: You are a kid at heart. You still have an optimistic life view - and you look at the world with awe.

13-19: You are a teenager at heart. You question authority and are still trying to find your place in this world.

20-29: You are a twentysomething at heart. You feel excited about what's to come... love, work, and new experiences.

30-39: You are a thirtysomething at heart. You've had a taste of success and true love, but you want more!

40+: You are a mature adult. You've been through most of the ups and downs of life already. Now you get to sit back and relax."

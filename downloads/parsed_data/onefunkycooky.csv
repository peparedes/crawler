"event","I wish I knew how to explain to the Irish drinkers side of my family that alcohol & liquor is like kryptonite to my physical healthiness without hurting their feelings or insulting them. They can't accept that the two years I spent imbibing alcoholic beverages regularly coincide with my becoming too sick to work or go to school anymore. All they see and remember is me leaving Worcester after graduating from high school and then being diagnosed with sitises and isms. I don't want one drink or one sip & I don't want to have to explain why or feel uncomfortable refusing anymore. too bad I'm too chicken shit & worried about ridiculous repercussions to say so."

"event","the answer should be yes in most cases if you say no or nothing you usually wont gain anything.
You've made some choices you regret but everyone is happy in the long run.
If you watch The Stand you'll wonder if Robert Kirkland was inspired by Stephen King at all. If you read it however you might not catch the wonder. 
After watching I also wondered how they got so many big names."

Do you stop taking the pills or the person? Or do you wait and see if one will adjust to the other like you've done with everything else in your life that's conflicted?"

"event","for some reason when i sleep i stretch myself into a much longer person than i actually am. and i sleep like the dead so jim can never wake me up to get me to shrink myself. i told him to shake me until i responded but for some reason he refuses to use force to disturb my sleep. also, hobsoncat does the same thing with the stretching out that i do, except i have no doubts that he is much ruder and obnoxious about it-i know for a fact he does NOT sleep like the dead. it didnt matter much in the winter becos we were always cold enough to sleep on top of each other in a warm trio formation, but now its summer and it gets sticky and hobson attacks us if we close the door so we cant sleep naked. this is really a major dilemma becos now jim takes naps at 4PM and gets up at 9PM and stays up so late i start passing out on the couch and then end up going to bed alone which sucks becos i dont sleep well alone, and even if hobson decides to come to bed when i go he always wants to play for twenty minutes first so he jumps around on the bed until i pay attention to him then finally hell fall asleep but as soon as im ABOUT to fall asleep he wakes up becos jim is still in the living room and he needs to know what jim is doing without him. but its hard to get mad at either of them becos they both use cute faces when they know im getting mad, and they always know. so what the hell am i supposed to do here. its not a pressing matter or anything but compared to the problems ive compained about before, this one is just ridiculous. i think im living the good life."

now im being bad at being alone again
i dont understand how i can be living this happily and still not want to exist when i take the time to think about it
perhaps i am actually unknowingly psychic and the not wanting to exist thinking is secretly a premonition of the end of the world speedily approaching but my brain knows that if i have a real psychic vision of the inevitable end i will react with panic and frenzy so instead of a full on prediction i am prompted to question general existence
sometimes i get nauseated for no reason
but im not unhappy
i just feel like ive outgrown my life
i do want to slap a bunch of people though
and scream until their heads explode
disgusting DISGUSTING
ah i just remembered the true reason why i want to give up
ABSOLUTE DISGUST WITH THE PEOPLE WHO I AM SUPPOSED TO LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY.

such wide spread terror and panic paralyzes my body which then in turn transforms what should be short reflection appointments into desperate battles to continue breathing normally so anything around me&nbsp;doesnt open my door to make sure im okay

"event","so&nbsp;in this night I was walking with one boy but remember that sushi place I loved I hoped I'd never see again that one boy pointed it out after I mentioned how much I liked sushi and I looked up and saw the sign and heard another boys voice for the next twenty minutes and it went away but now I've been woken up thrice by your voice and your face behind my eyes and in my head and I say&nbsp;I don't like it much&nbsp;but oh&nbsp;for those first few seconds of being awakened I certainly do&nbsp;like it much and oh I wish it would stop or at least let me live in my dreams&nbsp;and have those first few seconds forever. I'm not in standstill anymore&nbsp;these aren't&nbsp;a big problem these dreams but someday let me know&nbsp;it wasn't a lie prove the&nbsp;world wrong for once come back come back please sir&nbsp;someday come back so I can get high on your missing smile"

"event","I am tired so very tired and completely&nbsp;intolerent of anything and anyone and anyidea&nbsp;I dislike
and I have had just about enough of tapdancing and smiling winterbreak please come fasterfaster and lord baby jesus please don't make me play any more of these very trying very unsatisfying very prying G A M E S. If I have to inhale through my nostrils one more odor I'm really not fond of I'm going to take out my scissors and cut off the scarf that's holding my head to my neck. If I have to be convinced and slightly forced to drink or eat something&nbsp;that I KNOW is going to give me a tummy head neck brain ache&nbsp;that I want nothing to do with I am going to run very very very far away and be constantly on the move and send select people letters and notes with no return addresses. In three years I'm going to see you and you're going to see me and I'll&nbsp;remember that I still&nbsp;want you to be the one next to me every morning noon goodnight instead of&nbsp;who&nbsp;and we can go from there and maybe baby you can keep me up in bed and maybe baby you still do right now but in an absolutely&nbsp;terrible full of tears&nbsp;way but don't be flattered because the terrible full of tears way don't happen that often anymore now does it?
I walked into the first floor bathroom in my daddy's house at two thirty pm this afternoon. I prefer this bathroom to the upstairs bathroom, although the upstairs bathroom was just redone (in a very retro way). I turned on the shower (hot hot heat) opened the curtain and walked in with my favorite boxer shorts and tshirt still on my (aching) body. I sat directly in the center of the gleaming white tub closed the curtain and cried because&nbsp;I Am Sick And Tired.
I cannot find anyone else to match and sometimes this makes me extremely sad and very prone to uncontrolled dripples of tears&nbsp;
shush don't tell no one ever catches me"

"event","I started crouched by the hole that you dug, my hand small among the many stretched out waiting for you to grab. Now I'm lying alone on my belly by this grave, my hand the only one that still hangs down for you. They tsk me, they shake their heads sadly, they pat my back and give me heart-to-hearts, but I remain.

I can't tell if this is something I wrote while I was high or if it's from something I read because it's in my american voices class notes and I write things in random notebooks when I'm high a lot. I wonder when or where it's from. I think maybe I should smoke all the time."

"event","it isn't hard to smile all the time again but it's only because I've figured out how to keep myself busy and any free time I accidently have&nbsp;is muffled by playing my music really loud on my ipod. So I'm either going to go deaf or collapse&nbsp;so fuck shooting stars.&nbsp;But in real life it's not that bad and I finally think someone else is cute and I'm back with people who know what to do with me&nbsp;who love&nbsp;me who&nbsp;make sure I'm still standing up&nbsp;and maybe sometime soon I'm going to stop writing you things you'll never read.&nbsp;
but I wish I knew if you ever remembered like I do if anything that happened meant a thing to you I want to throw up&nbsp;when I believe you don't and it didn't&nbsp;and it sucks really fucking hard because I think I've lost any trust I had for the human race did you even like calvin and hobbes did you even like lions did you even like me was I just a game you played little boy remember when I didn't want to take off my pants because my underwear was too low then remember when we were so late but it didn't matter and I laughed and laughed and laughed&nbsp;in the end but my remembering never ends

"event","sometimes I absolutely can't believe some of the people I went to school with last year are actually in existence
and then the dozen remaining I hurt being with or&nbsp;without
I don't know if I had to chose which I would want
it made me think of the dilemma of my choosing between life and death if ever forced to
just because I want to know so bad what happens&nbsp;
I want to know too much it's awful
but knowing doesn't necessarily mean I'll remember it and make speeches about it I just want to have it somewhere so if I smell something or hear something or see something I can have just a little piece be triggered
and yet I'm still afraid of going to california or hawaii because of the earthquake and volcano factors how is knowing everything I can possible if I continue being afraid of loud noises
I love remembering moments with people because of a smell you catch in el nostrils
even if when the remembering ends it sucks because it made you sad you still feel so good for the few seconds"

"event","walking home from work today I kept smelling smells from the past
both&nbsp;ten years ago&nbsp;past and last year past
actually it's been happening all day
I wonder if it's just because it's&nbsp;halloween and dead things have&nbsp;the oppurtunity to be alive again or if this is some strange way of telling me I'm going to die soon
Instead of my life passing before my eyes it's familiar smells passing under my nose

my mommy is making meatloaf and mashed potatoes for when I go home friday though so I better not die before then
brian donovan should come home and eat at my house too but probably he's a giant ass and isn't going to."

it's really made me feel excellent about our recovering friendship and it's future !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

a squirrel threw an acorn at my brain today
also I saw two babies poking a headless pigeon corpse with sticks while giggling
and a pile of homeless blanket persons lying in a heap on the grass nearby
both groups had ruddy cheeks due to their general excitement and the slight wind chill factor
I really do love boston though"

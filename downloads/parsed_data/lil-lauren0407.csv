"event","soooooooo, lately my life is starting to slow down. on saturday i had a bowling match out in oxford and my team won by 3 points it was so close!! then after that i just stayed around the house and then went with my dad to pick up dinner. right after dinner i was going to get ready for work and my manager called and said that i did not have to come in to work because we were so slow. i was so happy. then on sunday i hung out with jessica for most of the day. she got her car stuck in the ditch so my dad had to pull her out. it was so funny. then i went to the movies around 7 with tiffany, her cuz, my friend and josh. it was so fun. we saw hostel. big mistake. by the end of the movie, all of us girls felt like we were going to throw up. but ya, a lot happened between me and josh at the movies and i am going to talk to him today about what is going on between us. well that is about it for now. i have to go get ready to go to the dentist. peace."

"event","hey guys. i have been sooooo busy with bowling lately, i am going crazy!!! last week i had practice on tuesday, thursday and friday. and then on saturday i went down to westland with the varsity girls for a tournament and today i had my match. i can not take it any more. along with bowling, i have work and all my meetings. this week is going to be hard but i can make it. there is always good along with the bad!! 


FUNNY STORY!!!
yesterday night after i got home from work (9:30) me and my dad went to pick up my sister and her friends from the movies. when we got there we saw to guys sitting in this little car and we thought nothing of it. when we were sitting there waiting for my sister and her friends, they drove by eating pizza looking for someone. just when my sister and her friends got in the car, they drove by again, and i honked the horn and waved. they kept driving for a couple of seconds and then they decided to back up and they rolled their window down and they were trying to talk to us. i told my dad to floor and and we left. i looked behind us and they were following us. my dad started to speed up and so did they. we finally lost them when we turned on to M-59. thank god. i learned my lesson. NEVER HONK THE HORN AT TWO GUYS IN A LITTLE CAR AT THE MOVIES!!!! lol.

well that is it for now. i am going to go study for some finals. peace!!

hope your team wins the football game keith. we missed you at dinner. maybe you can come next time."

"event","hey guys, whats up?? not to much here. i am at my grandparents house with my cuz. i just got back from the movies. i saw ""just friends"" with aaron, gusko and my cuz. it was really good i was just bummed because josh did not come, but there is always next time. soooo, early this morning i had to go out to oxford for my bowling match. IT SUCKED SO BAD. the night before they stripped to lanes instead of putting oil down. that made us start our match an hour late. i bowled like SHIT and i was getting really pissed off at one of my teamates because she was trying to coach everyone and was yelling at me over little things. but that is ok because i got both of my points and we won our match 27 to 3. i was sooooooooo happy. well thats it for now. i am going to go call matt. peace out. luv ya guys."

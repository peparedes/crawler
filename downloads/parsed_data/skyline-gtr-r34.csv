I'm still at Metro State, working on my bachelor's in photojournalism (and possibly a minor in French).  I moved to Denver in September, and I'm now living in student housing with three roommates (eesh.) and trying to find a new job to feed my travel habit.

Look me up on facebook, or on <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/andrew_bisset/"">flickr</a>.

Hope you're all doing well.

"event","well, not really.


okay, kinda.  i have a confession to make.


for everyone who thought i was already at Metro: I have been attending the prestigous Community College of Denver (because I can't stand ACC) for the past three semesters.  As of two weeks ago, I am a student of Metro State.  I'm moving up in the world.


I have kind of a foolish dream.  I've decided that a journalism degree (my straight-out-of-high school idea of a major) is far more marketable than a straight photo degree (no offence, Lexi).  Therefore, I have decided upon a suitable college for my degree: Northwestern University.


Now comes the fun part.  In order to have even a glimmer of hope of getting accepted, I'll have to pull a 4.0 this semester.  If I happen to get accepted, the next hurdle will be finances.  NU costs on the order of fourty-eight thousand a year, all expenses paid.  Crap.

So there you have it.  If I get in, it has to be fall '07.  NU only awards degrees to students who have been there for two years or more.  And let's face it, I can't afford more than that.


Aaaaaaaaaaand I have to work tomorrow morning.  Bedtime!"

"event","I went on a little adventure yesterday.  Lexi and I went up to Longmont to meet up with the Captain and Autowitch, but of course, we had to make a pitstop at the Eagle Mine.  We perused the buildings there for a while, and then proceeded to Longmont.

The other two were running late, so we decided to check out the abandoned sugar mill in Longmont.  Fantastic building, but a lot of activity nearby.  So we went and met up with the team and piled into the Land Cruiser (i want one now, specifically for this purpose) and went up Boulder Canyon.  

We then spent some time at the 'Jolly Rancher' mine, went about 20 feet into the mine itself, and took some shots of equipment in the area.  We then set out to find American City.  It turned out to be on private property, with signs of someone having been there very recently.  So we continued up the road to find an abandoned miner's cabin.  One room, but it looked like it held at least a family of three.  There were a lot of belongings left there.  It turned out to be very eerie with the fog (or cloud) moving in on us.

The next site was another old mine with some buildings clustered around it.  One of the buildings was filled with shelves containing thousands upon thousands of core samples.  The shelves had been warped by age and the weight of the rocks.  It all looked a bit surreal.

And yes, there will be pictures, but I'll need to develop them first.

Patience."

<br>
News Corp.'s Place in MySpace
 
By buying Web player Intermix Media and its runaway hit social-networking site, the media conglomerate gains on the Internet giants 
In less than two years, MySpace has emerged as one of the hottest sites on the Web. It has more page views than Google (GOOG ). And with 22 million members, and a growth rate of 2 million a month, it stands to rival MSN (MSFT ), Yahoo! (YHOO ) and AOL (TWX ) as one of the major destinations on the Web. 

With a heavy focus on music, it has become a part of daily life for teenagers and young adults nationwide. Members create highly personalized home pages loaded with message boards, blogs, photos, and streaming music and video. People use it to stay in touch with friends and meet other people. Driven by the expressiveness of its members, the social-networking site has emerged as an important channel for online advertising. TV shows and new music are often debuted on MySpace. 

CAUGHT ON QUICKLY.  Now it has drawn even more major attention, in the name of big bucks. On July 18, media conglomerate News Corp. (NWS ) revealed that it's buying Intermix Media (MIX ), the company that owns MySpace and about 30 other sites, for <b>$580 million in cash</b>. Los Angeles-based Intermix owns 53% of MySpace and plans to buy the rest. It will become part of News Corp.'s new Fox Interactive Media unit, which was created on July 15 and also is based in L.A. 

As word spread of the acquisition, News Corp. stock was practically unchanged in trading on July 18, with shares closing down 2 cents, to $17.45. Shares of Intermix were up 9.5%, to $11.74. 

""I've been in the Internet space for 12 years, and I've never seen a company grow and catch on at the rate that MySpace has,"" says Fox Interactive President Ross Levinsohn. The deal reflects Fox's ambitions to establish a premier presence on the Web. 

REMAKING THE SHOW?  MySpace has quickly beat back other social-networking sites such as Friendster. It has more than 14 million unique visitors a month, compared with Friendster's 1 million, according to market researcher comScore Media Metrix. But MySpace CEO Chris DeWolfe and President Tom Anderson have had much more in mind than just being the next Friendster. In an interview with BusinessWeek in May, they expressed a desire to become a lifestyle portal rivaling Yahoo, MSN, and AOL in size. 

The News Corp. deal could help the MySpace execs realize their ambitions. Fox can contribute massive amounts of capital to the site grow. It already rivals Viacom's (VIA-B ) MTV as the main distribution channel for new releases in the alternative-rock market. 

It has also proven itself as an ad and marketing medium. The premier of the NBC (GE ) comedy series The Office occurred on MySpace. And Billy Corgan, the singer and former leader of the rock band Smashing Pumpkins, debuted his new solo record, TheFutureEmbrace, on the site. 

CALIFORNIA SCHEMING.  MySpace has the potential to disrupt the ways business is usually done in media and entertainment. ""Now that MySpace is here, bands don't necessarily need a label to be heard,"" Corgan told BusinessWeek Online in an interview in May. If this becomes true for musicians today, it also could be true for filmmakers tomorrow. 

Why has MySpace succeeded where others have generated buzz but then failed? The answer is, partly, a matter of geography. It emerged from the L.A. music and club scene, drawing on Anderson and DeWolfe's friends for early support. It wasn't concocted by Silicon Valley tech types or New York bankers. It was born in a city that's geared toward media and entertainment, not technology or finance. And like other great exports from Southern California -- such as Hollywood and surfboards -- MySpace tapped into the country's psyche. 

Where other sites tried to be useful, sensible, and safe, MySpace endeavored to be exciting and fun. The early users included lots of models and musicians. As it happened, MySpace also has exploited technology to the max, making use of blogs before many rivals did. But the technology has always had a point -- allowing users to customize their sites and let their personalities shine through. And MySpace never sought to overly control the often riotous self-expression that followed. 

""THEY'RE VERY SMART.""  Levinsohn of News Corp. is careful not to hype the potential synergies. He says he wants to let MySpace go about its business, supporting Anderson and DeWolfe as needed. If it makes sense to launch a new Fox show on MySpace, the company will do it. But it appears to not plan on shoving those synergies down anyone's throat. 

Plus, News Corp. doesn't expect to shut rival networks and media companies out of MySpace, either. Perhaps the deal's greatest benefit is that it will help Fox spot the next important trend before it gets too big. ""They're very smart, and we're going to let them continue to do what they do,"" says Levinsohn. 

With this deal, Fox Interactive Media has taken a major step forward, after being overshadowed on the Web by companies such as Yahoo. Fox has a good understanding of what works and what doesn't, and it's willing to invest money and take risks. And the sheer magnitude of the all-cash deal shows that traditional media companies are figuring out that the Net is emerging as a primary channel for the distribution of news and entertainment."

I was laid off after three days.  My boss came up to me and was all like ""Well, as you can see, business is a bit slow, so since you were hired last, I have to let you go.""

It wasn't a total loss.  After that he gave me $100.

I leave on Friday.  Yays."

"event","Cos this world swallows souls
And when the blues unfold
It gets cold silence burns holes
You're going mad
Perhaps you always were
But when things was good you just didn't care
This is called irony
When you most need to get up you got no energy
Time and time shit'll happen
The dark shit's unwrapping
But no-one's listening your mates are laughing
Your brethren's fucking and then you start hating
Your stomach starts churning and you mind starts turning.
So smoke another draw
It won't matter no more but the next day still feels sore
Rain taps on your window
Always did tho but you didn't hear it when things were so-so
You're on your own now
Your little zone you were born alone and believe me you'll die
alone

Just trying to stay positive

Feels nice and still
Good thing about brown is it always will
It's easy, no-one blames you
It's that world out there that's fucked you
You know less of a person and if God exists
He still loves you
Just remember that - the more you sink the further back from
that brink
Maybe you've lifetime scars and you think tattoos might be more
fitting
But who's picking?
Searching for yourself you find demons
Try and be a freeman and grasp that talisman
Cos your the same as I am
We all need our fellow man
We all need our samaritan.
Maybe I'm better looking than you tho
Maybe I've got more dough - but am I happier... no.
Get the love of a good girl and your world will be much richer
than my world
And your happyness will uncurl

Just trying to stay positive

Stop dreaming
People who say that are blaspheming
They're doing nine to five and moaning
And they don't want you succeeding when theyve blown it
And you idols - who are they?
They too dreamt about their day
Positive steps will see your goals.
Whether it's dollars or control, feel the gold.
I aint helping you climb the ladder
I'm busy climbing mine.
That's how it's been since the dawn of time
If you reach a cul-de-sac
The world turns it's back
This is you zone, it's like blackjack
He might get the ace or the top one
So organise your two's and three's into a run then you'll have
fucked him son
And for that you'll be the better one
One last thing before you go though
When you feel better tommorow you'll be a hero
But never forget today. you could be back here
Things can stray
What if you see me in that window?
You won't help me I know.
That's cool, just keep walking where you go.
Carry on through the estate, stare at the geezers so they know
you aint lightweight
And go see your mates
And when they don't look happy
Play them this tape

Just trying to stay positive

I hope you understand me
Just trying to stay positive
I aint no preaching fucker and I aint no do-goody-goody either
This is about when shit goes pear-shaped
And if you aren't or ever have been at rock bottom then good
luck to you in the big wide  world
But remember that one day shit might just start crumbling
Your bird might fuck off or you might lose your job
It's when that happens that what I'm talking about will feel
much more important to you
So if you aint feeling it, just be thankfull that everythings
cool in your world
Respect to BC
Positivity
Positivity

Just trying to stay positive"

I called Kat a few days ago.  Either she was in a really pissy mood or is just sick of me.  The last words I heard from her were ""Leave me alone until I call you.""  Ah well.  Ha, I still intend to keep doing tango because now I'm going for the dance and not for her.  What a concept...

And incidentally, the other girl I was dating, Kate (Aaa too many K's), has gotten back with her ex.

But, hey, look on the good side.  I have 6 and a half days of HIGH SCHOOL left.

your smoldering breath on my
shoulders as we  move   across   
the dance floor

the muscles in the small of your back

of this dance, your body incorporating
perfectly timed movements of
your high-heeled feet and
  seductive legs.

the pull of the rhythm

there is no existence

nothing at all but you, me, and the music.
  Trancelike.
      Weightless.
          Moving as one until
  the music ends.
    Then the passion begins anew
      as another record is put on,
a lonely piano melody.
       As the notes bend and float above the lights
          we move slightly closer to each other
       slip deeper into the moment
          and stalk across the floor.
       Lips brushing my neck.
           the slow piano seeming to
              move the hands on the clock apart

       few remaining measures of music
                   these
         beats counted only by our bodies
            these steps, now slowing...
         but our minds keep dancing.
       keep moving, time marked not in strings,
           but in heartbeats."

When asked what the primary colors are, answer ""RGB""

You get the urge to 'fix' poor quality images.

You start teaching your significant other to use this ""evil"" program and in the space of one afternoon convince them it's at least only quasi-evil in the face of PSP.

You ramble about a breakthrough in the piece you're doing to people who have no idea in hell what you're talking about

You ponder the meaning of existence without layers.

You never leave the house without a digicam and notepad.

You drop something and your brain tells you automatically ""Ctrl-Z! Ctrl-Z!"". When you realize it won't work, your brain tells you ""Ctrl-Alt-Z! Ctrl-Alt-Z!"" 
 
You're getting dressed for something important and you look in the mirror and realize you would look so much better if you could just tweak the levels a little and apply a slight gaussian blur. 
  
You stop on the street to rant about cheesey effects that should not be on professional posters.

You scream out fonts as they appear on TV.

You have dreams in ""glowing edges"" 

You're standing by the ocean and wondering who used Ocean Ripple.

You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other friends who are addicted to Photoshop. </font></td></tr></table>

Oh, and I talked to Kat Friday night.  She was on the way in as I was on the way out.  The way I figure, she doesn't hate me, so that's a step in the right direction.

You want juicy details?  Tough, cos you're not getting any.  
Hmmm...I also need to figure out what's going on with Allison...weird stuff happened last night, that's for sure.
Katy called me at aboot 12.20 last night and we talked the whole train ride back.  Apparently she was supposed to be working on some kind of project and needed a distraction(?)  Oh, well, it was amusing.

"event","My hand is lonely
and craves to embrace yours
to entwine our fingers,
to hold you close.
My angel, my darling,
I miss you so much.
It's been so long, baby, since I felt your touch.
Your beautiful kisses
made my breath leap
but I think there's a promise that I have to keep.
I'll always be there
if you need someone to cry to
someone to hear you,
someone to hold you,
someone to reassure you,
cos we all have grey days.
I've always been attracted
like an unbearable force.
Sometimes I have to check myself
before I fall for you,
step over the edge
into the endless valley of you
that seductive rush
when you know you've fallen hard.
it leaves me wanting
wanting you to want me.
longing to will this attraction
into being.
But I know I can't
force it to.
You told me so long ago
that I needed you
to keep me from falling
into another chasm
I talked to you for an eternity
before I saw your face
you gave me something to hope for
something to believe in
Knowing that a thousand miles,
a million starry nights,
ten thousand words,
and a hundred fulfilling conversations stood between you
and me.
And you wanted me.
So I came to you on my moonlit
silver wings,
you in my head the whole time.
And when I saw you
face to face
I began to fall.
I halted myself though.
But now I wonder
will it ever be okay
to fall into you?"

'cos I am the words.
You have written me down
line by line
in metaphor and simile
you've painted a picture
of me and my ribbons.
In the effortless characters
your graphite blood
renders my soul.
I know now that
you have me figured out.
Not yet completely,
but the threads that I don't have,
the threads that have unraveled,
bits of the tapestry of my mind.
I know now
what's keeping me sane.
A junkie, a slut, a spinner?
A spinner of webs,
of visions and concepts,
imprints of my tattered spirit.
Others whisper curses about her,
voodoo hexes in the twilight.
But they don't know what I know now.
That she's not a whore.
Not from the cold concrete of Colfax and Speer.
Not a junkie.
Getting her fix from the alleys of 15th.
But a beautiful girl.
Who can see past the scars,
past the pain, past the teardrops turned to blood.
Straight through what I was
as if I was the plexiglas
of an old museum case.
To see what I can become.
And she cares for the man inside the boy
aching, yearning to break out,
to return the kindness shown to him,
though he could never care for her
more than he does now.
'cos I know now
why I'm not hopeless
not a Fort Logan inductee
Because of my beautiful junkie.
I know now that she does believe.
Believe in what?
Believe in life,
believe in love,
believe in whatever's inside me.
I still can't figure it out.
All this shit I've been carrying around,
but she's always seen what really matters.
My truly amazing junkie."

I'm sick of being alone.
I think of you next to me,
But it doesn't feel the same.
I want you holding me tight,
Kissing me all through the night,
So I can see the candlelight
Reflecting off your eyes.
I miss your lips on me, babe
And your fingers in my hair.
I miss that wonderful scent
That lets me know you are near.
I miss your lilac kisses,
And your warmth when you are here.
I just wanted you to know
So when the icy night descends,
You'll think of me and you,
And we'll be ablaze again."

-----------------------------------------------
I think you've given me withdrawl
Because your kisses
Felt like silk beneath it all
And I know your touch will make me miss
You so terribly tonight
But even more so now I know
I want this to be more than just kisses
Because, darling, I can see there's more below
The beautiful girl I so badly miss
Your neck was like velvet as I kissed it
And I felt you hold your breath
Maybe somehow my feelings can fit
With the kisses of the girl I'm missing to death
I can't stop this addiction to you
I know I can say right now definitively
That I'd want no on in the world
But you lying here next to me
Just like you were tonight when I twirled
Your hair in my fingers
Like so many strands of this lonely night
With your head on my heart
I took your hand and held it tight
Because I think; no, I feel that this is the start
Of the beautiful addiction that you are"

And these silver strings will sing
The song of the last time

So I walked through your door
And kissed your lovely face
I couldn't ask for more."

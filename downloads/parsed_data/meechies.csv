"event","Well itz been a while since i wrote in here and i thought that maybe it was about time to sum up my worthless life all over again.  So here it goes.....

Went to the lake yesterday and i've been going tons so i got a nice tan so thatz great.  But my legs are killing me after swimmin for a couple hours i had to walk home beccause the people i met up there had more then they expected and i didn't want to get caught in a very small car with 8 other people so i walked...which of course took like 3 hours which isn't bad...i just phoned people and kept myself busy on the way home which was pretty cool...Anyways i may have gotten a job in vancouver and i'm moving out there as soon as me and the person i'm movin in with find a suitable place that will tend to work for the both of us...Trying to cut down on the most commutin hours as we possibly can...Lets see what happens.  

right now i'm at work and itz alright altho there isn't that much work for me to do here so that kinda sucks but hey! not like i can change anything or anything like that.  Besides i love my job..i like working here and i think that it would be a wicked ass work experience and it would be a much better office if it was in the city and not this hick town.  But i love my bozz she means a lot to me altho i'm sure that she doesn't think of me as more then an employee but hey....what can you do right..

adam i want u to save up 1500$...5$ a day...thats it...and meet me in mexico in march...i miss you and if u just save up a little bit everyday then it won't be that expensive.  U'll see.  I'm working it out right now....

Its the 23 of june so...
June - 7 days x 5$ = 35$
July - 31 days x 5$ = 155$
August - 31 days x 5$ = 155$
Sept - 30 days x 5$ = 150$
Oct - 31 days x 5$ = 155$
Dec - 30 days x 5$ = 150$
Jan - 31 days x 5$ = 155$
Feb - 28 days x 5$ = 140$
March - 23 (i think is when we leave) dayz x 5$ = 115$

Total = 940$ so considering u'd only need like 5 hundred more...which includes 200 spending..( i think) that's pretty good...and if u get a good check then add like 100$ to the savings... plz try :( for me :( 

anyways i'm gonna go now cause itz almost 5 and we gotta close...have a goood day all and matt i miss you too...we haven't hung out in 2 months and i miss ya...So please letz hang sometime...

Bye everyonez muah"

"event","lmmfao omfg there was the carnival in our town this weekend so leanne asked me to go with her...well when we got there she decided that she wanted to ditch me for allan and jen.... but itz all good cause mah good gal Vanessaclese was there and Jenna and some other ppl were there so we hung out. me and vanessa went on some rides together and OMFG was it sooooooo much fun.  I mean 6 rides for 11.00$ is pretty damn good.  Anyways while we were at the carnival some carny started to hit on Jenna cause she's got very BIG boobs, soo of course every guy that is horny is gonna try to get her.  Dun get me wrong she's a great gal and isn't about to just sleep with anyone and she's really pretty and what not but still..So this carny decides to invite himself drinking with us.  And we was ""aight ur hot"" sooo come with us.   Now while we went drinking he was telling us about ""carny lang"" and one thing he said was killer funny.  If one of the carnies sees a chick with a big rack coming down the walk way he'll yell out killer loud ""DOESER""  which means, ""does are some big boobs"" and you like hear an echo of ""DOESER"" going down the line and they all know they're coming.  Anyways so we went drinking and he decides to come bakk to Jenna's with us.  Well what can we say HE'S A FUCKING WHORE!!!! lmmfao!  (a hot whore but still a whore) and his carny friends were calling us ""just another slut in another small town"" and we got killer pissed.  Anyways when we were at the house he continued to hit on all three of us.  But when he couldn't get anything more then a kiss from Jenna, he moved to Vanessa and when she didn't put out, he moved to me!! lmmfao what a whore....anyways we're going bakk to the carnival to beat up the other carnies that called us down...anyways...ttyl lmfao omg such a good nite :D"

"event","What's so great about living?  I mean everyday we go through life and we have more and more problems arise.  Nothing goes right no matter how hard you may try.  Ever feel like you are being ignored no matter how loud you scream?  Ever feel like there is nothing under you as u fall even though you're standing on solid ground?  Ever feel like no one in the world is there for you, only saying that they are to try to make you smile?  Or when you don't need anyone, everyone's there?  But when you need someone no one is to be found?  Or when you want to be alone you can't find the time?  Or when u want to be with someone, there is no one around?  How bout feeling like there is something that you're forgetting?  But only to find out your forgetting who you really are as a person?  Ever wish that you could change one thing about you?  To only realize that it was already changed, you just don't see why it matters anymore?

I've been thinking a lot lately.  And i'm wondering, do we really know who we are?   I mean truthfully, you may know what we feel, or what we want.  But WHO are we?  Are we someone that made a difference in the past?  Or someone who will make a difference in the future?  Or have you thought about who's lives you really have touch?  Or made a difference in?  Does it really matter?  Have you ever wondered what would happen if you had said yes to the first guy/gurl that asked you out instead of no?  

How different would you're life had been if u had a choice to change one thing from your past?  Or make one decision about the future?   

There are too many unanswered questions in this world.   One that really needs an answer tho is:

What is the point of Living? 

I don't know the answer to this question, therefore i don't see the point of living."

Ok, other news.
I've made a decision that it's ok to openly dislike people.  I'm saying--screw manners and say whatever the hell you want whenver you want.  I've come to realize that part of womankind's problem is the fact that they try to be polite and thoughtful while all the while just thinking, and occasionally letting slip, horrible thoughts.  FUCK IT--just say 'em outloud, you know?  I mean what's the right way if not honest?  Ladies are always trying to be sensitive and give a fuck, but I mean, that seems to just cause cattiness (sp?) and then we, as ladies, get a bad wrap for being shit-talking, whiny ovarian factories.  If we as a group would like to rule the world I think we're going to have to toughen up a bit and shoot the shit straight style.

I don't have any one situation in mind here, but I'm just ready to cut the crap and get down to business in general.  I think you can be a thoughtful, caring and compassionate person without being slimy and sugary.  It's all about finding the balance, yo.  I feel like there are so many cultures that really value telling it like it is and I wonder why American culture is so against that.  Our roots are pretty rough and tumble, especially out here in the wild wild west.

I'd just like to know if there's something valuable about pettiness and non-confrontational behavior?  I feel that I could be missing a whole piece to the pie here, folks.

Well, that's all for now compadres.

Peace and happiness,

"event","So I pretty much never write in this thing.  Mostly because I have absolutely no idea what to say.

Uh...

...ok.  So school is alright.  The semester is winding down and finals are right on my ass like Jeff Gordon on the first place stock car in the Indy 500 ( I have no idea if that's a viable comparison).  I'm very pleased to be at such a fine mecca of academic enlightenment.  However, it seems to me, at Berkeley one cannot move at their own pace.  I, as a human, like to do what I like to do.  I'm not into activities, responsibilities or tasks that don't interest me.  I mean, for reals (haven't seen that one in awhile, huh?) this is free freakin' country, no?  So, for me, taking tests and writing papers on material that doesn't interest me is really not what I'm about.  Often times, I just don't do certain assignments simply because I do not like them.  It seems to me that should be my perogative (I really don't know how to spell that word).  I pay for my semesters, so I should spend them how I want.  If I want to get a zero, I should be able to get a zero. However, at the fabulous UC Berkeley, home of thousands of over-achieving, self-serving assholes, one cannot avoid feeling guilty for setting their own individual goals that often do not quite line up with the academic pace.  It's as if students here do work just because that's what they're ""supposed to do.""  I know the stripped version of this is that I'm essentially, what some would call, a ""slacker.""  I just feel like Berkeley has so much to offer academically but most of my assignments do not even touch this iceberg of opportunity.  If Berkeley didn't have so many obsessive sheep who simply go through the various motions to fulfill a societal definition of ""normal"" and ""successful,"" I feel like we'd all be much better off.  In fact, maybe gas prices wouldn't be so high, we would have a competant leader who resembles less of an ape and more of a human being and we'd probably all enjoy ourselves a little more.  Nutshell:  I never envisioned the birthplace of modern Free Speech and American activism as a fenced pasture of caged beings who work so hard, day and night to get ""ahead.""

My question is: ahead of what?  

Do these said students honestly believe that they'll have a meaningful, life-changing experience at KPMG or Google or being someone's research bitch?  If so, where the heck are our standards as youthful, world-changers?  I suppose 5 years at a respectable business, a promotion, a loving spouse, 2.3 kids and a beautiful semi-custom track home in Dublin seems successful enough.  But is that it?  That's really it?

Maybe I'm just not meant for American soceity or something.  I just can't help but wonder, and I wonder this for a solid 2-3 hours per day, whether or not there's a whole population of American college students who are just locked up inside themselves, yearning ( for lack of a less cheesy word) to break free and express all of their hidden desires (not too sexually, violently, or detrimentally, of course).  Do the youth of today even appreciate or respect personal expression anymore?  I certainly hope so.  From my minimal Berkeley experience, this appreciation seems to be hiding in the bushes, not waiting to strike or anything, just chillin' in the shrubs.

I think for now I'll just continue to learn my own way at Berkeley.  I'll try my very best to not feel obligated to answer to my classmates about late papers, crappily written papers, or incomplete papers.  I mean, seriously, if I don't spend my time on this planet maximizing each experience to my own standard, why don't I just go all Al Capone on this shit and break every law known to mankind?  Hell, why don't we all just do that.  Alright, alright, nevermind.

Well, I feel a little better.  Everyone should probably like dance around right now a little or make up some crazy moves or noises.  Hopefully no one will spit on your shoes today and flick you in the eye.  That would hurt.

Exponential love and peace,
S."

"event","well i guess since everyone is on the whole new years kick, i'll do mine.

basically, in 2006 i learned some harsh but true realities:

1) Life is tough sometimes.

2) You think you know someone like the back of your hand, and--POOF--you don't know them at all.

3) Everyone should watch their back like they're in south central because seriously--shit comes out of the middle of freakin nowhere sometimes and not just armed robberies.

4) The internet and all of its complex social networks has really sent my grammar to the crapper.

i guess that's basically it.

i really hope 2007 holds something decent for me and everyone else.

...FYI.

So, i haven't updated in a real long time.

I don't suppose there's all that much to say.  I went to Colorado this weekend.  What a time.  I saw people that I haven't seen in many years, reconnected with some cousins.  Actually, I'm not sure ""reconnected"" is the right word considering I don't think I was ever legitimately connected to them.  That's neither here nor there, I suppose.  It was a good time with them.  However, I observed something so strange--a family (that I'm a part of) fucntioning as a tightknit entity when in reality, we rarely all get together.  THese people are just foreigners to me, but they don't sing ""Cold as Ice"" or ""Jukebox Hero.""  I felt slightly out of place most of the time due to this fact.  Needless to say, I went there to close some doors safely and calmly, and successfully did so.  

I did meet an incredible person also.  We're in-lawly related, I suppose.  He was potentially one of the smartest men I've ever met and I was so enamored.  I was hating the fact that it's so unlikely for me to end up with a man that well-rounded and...i'll say it...perfect.  Green, progressive, controlled, and he loved his wife soooooooo much.  The look on his face when he saw her was inspiring and crushing at the same time.  Still, it was really one of the most genuine and impressive conversations I've ever had.  Plus, I got to witness my uncle Danny going crazy on immigration.

I don't even know why I just wrote all of that above.  All of it, whY?  I mean, who gives a shit?  I'm so lame sometimes.  Everyone is so lame sometimes.  Earth to Earth!!--WE need to DE-lame-ify.  ASAP.

john lennon died 25 years ago today.  this morning i was very very very sad about it.  i think listening to KFOG's tribute reminded me of how amazing he was.  he really was as big as jesus.  honestly, he just did something to people, well he still does actually.  i'm wearing black today, childish i know.  it makes me feel reverent though. paying homage to one of my personal gods. if there is one thing i could wish for it would be to be alive while he was and share existance with him.  that would be so sexy.  his voice, his lyrics, his humor, his message...i love all of it.  imagine...will you please?

"event","a little bird named Christina Kim told me i should write something in this thing.  it's been nearly one year since my last entry, and what do you know? the world's ending!  hurricanes, earthquakes, murders, inditements, seriously folks--if you have not accepted Jesus Christ as your personal lord and savior, now is the time because the end is near. i've realized lately that God is sending us a serious message.  we, as humans and contributers to the earth's general well-being, need to wake up and start living righteous lives.  we are ignoring the word of the Lord our Father.  The bible speaks of this twisting of faith and action, but we must heed its words and move forward towards the Second Coming.  People need to live their lives for Jesus, because it's him we have to thank.  I have been learning to love my faith and i plan on relying on it in these hard times.

Well, you see, all my life i've basically been doing something.  I've never just done nothing, I don't know how to.  This is all part of my changing--to do things that i've never done and learn from them.  It felt alright i guess.  You should try it.

I'm pretty upset about this whole 4 more years bullshit.  I posted this message on craigslist.com (my new fav website, reference my last post for proof) that related bush and assassination and some suggestions.  Anyway, a friendly craigslist reader forwarded my message to the mother fuckin secret service, and now I'm supposedly on a watch list.  Honestly, I think this narking cat is full of god dang bullshit, but we'll see.  I guess when i get yanked off the next plane i'm on, i'll know who to thank. pssshhhhh

I think the ocean is beautiful and has a very significant effect on peoples.  I went camping on the coast on Friday night.  There was sea, there was sand, and there was even these huge ass sand dunes that rocked my world.  Lindsay, Emily, Buddy, Reid and I left Friday afternoon and camped near a town called Florence.  We played in the dunes on fri night and saturday and hiked to the ocean.  The hike was all the way across the dunes and through a path and it was a damn long walk.  I'm not going to lie, I was winded.  whew!  The beach was awesome, it never disappoints.  Really, it performs every time.  We froliced, we jammed on the seashell search (say that 5 times fast!), and we just generally enjoyed our asses.  Here comes the brunt of the philosophy-- ocean air and the natural effect of the beach makes people happy.  I was so relaxed and happy on friday and saturday.  I forgot that I had work to do and responsibility and that life sucks most of the time.  I forgot all of that and just jammed with it and didn't care that I got wet up to my belly button and then had to walk 2 miles back to camp.  No no, that didn't matter.  You know why? Because I had sand and sea and friends.  

We got back Saturday and cleaned up and went to a toga party.  It was alright, but sweaty and crowded so we moved the jammin up to BK2.  It was a good time.  I went to bed blazed and content.  Today was lazy as usual and now I have an dump truck full of homework to chill with.  Shit ass.  

I'm having a special visitor on thursday that i'm overwhelmingly excited about.  

Now it's time for me to do my shit and jam on it responsible style.

just kidding...but I got you, didn't I??  Man I'm good.  Anway, here's my update.  Here I am updating.  Update up!

I was up in Seattle for the long weekend.  I attended Bumbershoot.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with this fabulous festival, it's a four day festival primarily centered around music.  There are bits of performing arts and comedy thrown in and it is held at this rockin' place called Seattle Center.  The Space Needle is right there, Experience the Music Project is right there, the Science Center--right there, downfuckintown Seattle is right there.  It's sweet.  So I saw Death Cab for Cutie and the Presidents of the United States of America (remember ""Peaches""?) on Friday eve.  Saturday was.....prepare yourselves....Nickelback!!!!! (j/k) and Sunday fuckin' off the hook with Public Enemy and NAS.  Then Monday was Built to Spill (way damn sweet) and The Pixies.  Those were just the mainstage shows.  Off the mainstage I got to see Pedro the Lion, Brother Ali, Unwritten Law, Obo Addy, Quasi Nada, Toots and the Mayhals, and even a little Marley Brothers.  It was basically totally jammin'.  I went with Sachi and Lindsay and we had such a good time.  We participated in this fabulous parade called Vamola.  There were all these crazy drummers in it and people with these giant butterflies on sticks.   We just danced like crazy and rocked out like a bunch of mother fuckin hippies trippin on LSmotherfuckinD.  I felt overwhelmingly happy there.  It made me optimistic for this next election and I really hope these people's enthusiasism continues.  

The drive wasn't too bad, Monday's went by fast cuz good ole Lindsay stayed awake with me.  All in all, Seattle is steller and Bumbershoot was a jammin' experience.  

School is good.  I still sorta wanna go home.  I just miss my mama and my p.m.

I found out my grandfather will be voting for the piece of shit in Nov.  I'm nervous.  This means I'm directly associated with an asshole.  CRAP.

Well, I'm sick, so I should probably hit the dang sack so I can improve my health.  FIDDLESTICKS, I hate colds.

"event","Well, here I am.  I'm all settled at WU for another jammin year in Shitalem.  I finished my first damn class this morning.  ""History of Art of Asia"" since I love the Asians.  Word to the AZNS.....what!  I'm actually feeling pretty good about this year.  I'm glad as shit that I have a car, sometimes you just need to jam out of Salem and breathe a bit.

I'm not going to lie, saying bye bye to mama was tough.  I am gonna miss that lady like hell.  I guess that's what the telephonay is for.  I'm just glad I love her.  Loving is good.

I'm going to go listen to The Shins now.  They rock my flippin world."

"event","Ladies and gentleman-- I have an announcement:

I have purchased my very own motor vehicle.

It is a 1998 Acura 2.3 CL.  Really just a splendid car.  I'm glad I finally found one.  It took freakin forever.  At least I got a good deal on a car with low mileage (ultimate goal in case you were wondering).

Me and some stupid breezy (Lauren E. Campbell) went to see Princess Diaries 2 last night.  Definitely had a retard factor significantly higher than the first one.  I could deal with #1, but #2....well...let's just say, I resorted to making up interesting ways of collecting candy with my hands....that stupid breezy will know what the shit I'm talking about.

Yesterday I also enjoyed a fabulous trip to San Crazyisco.  I love my home.  There are so many god damn psychos here.  E.G.--Katherine and I are enjoying our lunch in Yerba Buena Gardens, minding our own shittin' business, and--POWthefuckBAM-- some crazy bitch sitting a few feet over is yellin at some guy she's calling ""Joe"".  Now, this is not normal yelling, it was
""Joe--You asshole, pick those up [flying napkins], you asshole.""  
""Joe, fucking relax.""  
""Joe, you mother fucker, get over here!""
This lady was on a mission to seriously knock Joe's self-esteem down 35 fuckin' notches.  Still, it was dang hilarious.

In con clue zeon, things are pretty much jammin.  I'm ready to pack up the good ole acura and move my ass back to Oregon.

I hope you yourself are having a pretty good day and I hope no one farts in your face or pinches your ass inappropriately.

out"

"event","Today is my last day of work.  I'm a little sad, because I like this office and its lovely view.  God damn I have a sweet job.  Now--it's back to dang school.

""Back to school, yes, I will go back to school...no one can take what my father has built...unless THAT MAN IS ME!""

bbzzzziippppp--""back to reality oooops there goes gravity.""

That is enough song singing you silly broad.  So anyway, today I will have my last lunch hour with my mom in SF. 
tomorrow I will buy a car, 
and the next day, well....I may just cut my fingernails.  What are you gonna do about that?  Wanna take it outside Louie?

I am so weird.  Man.  Last night, I was all happy and shit and then, I got to Safeway to buy dinner and I got mega sad and shit.  I just don't know what the freak was up.  Basically I stood in the yogurt section getting very frustrated about the misplaced light yoplaits.  They should be in the light section god damnit, not with the yoplait whips.  JEEEsus people.

Well, I look forward to your comments (nudge nudge hint hint).  I hope you don't get gizzed on or punched in the solar plexis today.

Whoa hold up you mother fucker.

Today is my first day of kindergarten bitch.  Actually it's just my first day of ""LJ"" or live journal or blogging or whatever the damn hell you want to call this shit.

Today I went to work.  I trained my replacement receptionist.  She is nice.  I got very scared on BART.  It was because there were a lot of people.

Well, now I suppose it's time to go watch ""Honey,"" with those two breezies I call my frens.  

I'm out G...."

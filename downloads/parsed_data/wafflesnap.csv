Because that smile,

my heart jump
my goosebumps climb to my neck

"event","There's this emptiness I feel that I can't quite pinpoint again. This time, it's only lonelier because I can't find anything wrong with my life. I've been really sad before, I've done stupid things to cope up, but it was because somehow, something would go completely awry -- just like getting caught, changing the course of your life, or hopping from one emotional source of affection to another. Everything's stable now. He loves me now more than he did before. Usually, when things are too okay, he gets bored. But he's happy. He's really happy. I'm starting to feel that I""m trusting him with things. That he won't break my fragile heart into a million pieces. I don't need to look for a source of affection anymore. I already have it just as much as I have an outlet. I can't be caught with anything anymore because my life has been smoothsailing, sticking to the rules as much as possible. My grades, though they could've been better, are not bad atall. Though I know I'm still far away from reaching my life goals, I know I'm finally taking steps closer to it.

So where does this emptiness come from? Where does this immense sadness and disappointment stem from and why do I feel this way? I can't tell him how sad I am right now, I don't want him to worry. He's seen me get really depressed that it scared him so much. I'm not lost, I'm not in a dark room, I'm not in a detour. I'm just sad, really sad. I'm disappointed. There's more that I wish I could give but I just can't. And even if I could, what would I need it for? My life is fine.

Somehow, I think I've just lost meaning."

"event","I keep on asking myself, ""Should I fall even more in love?"" It kills me and I know it's making me sick. He's going to leave me soon, I just know it. We fought last night. It's been a series of fights since that night I cried so much until the sun already rose. He's so stressed, he got sick because of it. He's been throwing up for more than 24 hours now and the doctor had to inject pain killers just to relieve his headache. I feel like most of the stress was because of me. I know I really can't complain. I have to accept the fact that he's so damn busy, there's nothing much I can do except wait for him to finish what he's doing.

I'm such a masochist. I was stalking around freely in the joint account of his and his ex's (who he claims he ""never really loved"") and I felt like some kind of addict who kept clicking on every single link I could find, even if I knew ever time I'd see another picture of them, it killed me even more. How can someone have so many pictures together that they practically had an album for ever single day? How come she threw him a surprise picnic on his birthday? How come he sent her roses personally, placed it on her bed, and added a little note? All I got was a stupid bunch of stargazers from his brod who basically did it without him asking. How come on Valentines day, he had someone serenade her outside her house at 12 midnight? How come he wrote such a fucking love struck note about the both of them even during the latter part of their relationship?

The truth is, I practically don't see him anymore because his stupid frat and org work keep me from him. I know I can't complain because he can't let go of either.

What he said last night ripped my heart into pieces. He said I was such a problem and he was about to give up on me. Did he really mean it or did he just say that out of anger to spite me? Jian's right, what makes us hate ourselves more is that fact that we know we're going to take them back no matter how much they're going to hurt us or how badly they leave us.

It still kills me that he's this sick right now. I know most of the stress was because of me. Maybe we should cool it off for a while. I don't know. I hate it but it might be better for him. <i>Putanginang mundo ka bakit ka ganito???</i>"

"event","It's funny I received an SMS quote from someone I was interested in last year (just because of his lame-o scars) about the right people not meeting and taking initiative at the right time. The thing is, all the while, he never made a move and now he constantly bugs me and texts me. He even remembered my birthday (which is weird because I never told him about it). It's a littly bit disappointing (although I don't regret it not happening) that he didn't bug me a few months earlier. He would've stood a chance. I guess he was too late. The ""double coincidence of wants"" just didn't work out for him and me.

Speaking of this double coincidence of wants (which I learned in Econ), I've noticed that in relationships, there's always this requirement of ""chemistry"" and it sucks because it's too picky when it comes to the right timing, the right place, and the right manner. Sometimes, one party does it all correctly but it doesn't lead him to the result that he wants. The other party may just not be as interested. Or more commonly, I've noticed how a lot of people take two steps back before entering a relationship because they don't know just how much the other party is willing to give.

How come we don't apply the same solution as we did with the barter system? Why don't we create some relationship money ala fiat money? It's kind of weird, knowing that there are so many economical geniuses in this world and no one's even tried to revolutionize an idea like this. It doesn't necessarily have to be like money MONEY per se. It could well just be laying down your cards ala pusoy dos to see how far you're willing to sacrfice your Full House to be able to use your Dos Diamond separately from its pair. Lester called my idea silly. I don't know, don't you think this just makes things easier for everyone? Because seriously, I'm almost giving up on this struggle. It's leading me nowhere."

"event","It's been pretty crazy lately that I haven't noticed how fast this year has gone. We're about to enter the last quarter of the year next year yet it still feels like January. I admit, finally leaving the ""being a minor"" stage is something hard to swallow in. For one, I've always felt like I could get away with so many things since I couldn't land in jail anyway. But aside from that, I've been so used to the idea that I'm always so many years younger than everyone else (or that I'm the only minor around). Somehow crossing that thin age line makes me wonder why eighteen's so special. I mean, seriously, when I was 17 years and 364 days old, it didn't feel any different so how does being 18 make me more mature? Yeah, repercussions (such as getting jailed or charged with a criminal offense) seems scary enough an idea to somehow make me control myself but it doesn't necessarily mean that I've changed the way I've viewed things. For all I care, sex, drugs, and rock and roll still lives on!

It's funny how I'm turning 18 and while most girls mark their 18th birthday as one of the most important dates of their life, I have nothing special going on on that date. I only have forty-two days left before my birthday and it's too late to prepare for a kickass debut. Wuh. The last time I had a birthday party (a real one, that is) thrown for me, I was <u>seven</u> and I celebrated it with my sister. I miss being the princess! I miss the cool cakes full of fattening icing! I miss deciding which stuff to put up for my party! NOOOOOOOO!

I want I want I want. I'm being bratty right now but who cares?

In spite of UP frustrations and <i>intense</i> shock from the things I found out <i>only</i> recently, I'm just too bored with my life right now. At this point, I don't even know what I'm chasing after. A dream? A cause? Or a life away from shadows? Even at that, can I actually keep up with it or am I just running after an illusion? In turn, my entire world chases me. It bites my ass up to the very last inch of my skin.

It's really strange to realize only now that all my life, I've been training myself to get away from home. And now, I just might be able to. But the things I've always dreamt of, would it still be the way I've always imagined it? And why do I keep on running away from my life that people can't seem to follow me anymore."

Soon, I'll be getting my admission slip to Diliman, moving out of Manila, and well, absorbing the heat of the huge University. I know, I still have to learn how to ride the <i>toki</i> and the <i>ikot</i> jeeps, fix and enlist subjects (manually), and basically, go around campus without having to get lost. Somehow, all these miniscule yet essential matters of consequences are pulling me two steps back when I'm supposed to be taking that giant leap towards my dream.

On another note, I've been noticing lately that I actually <s>like</s> liked someone for a very long time now but only because well, I'm not supposed to like him. Maybe I am a walking contradiction (or somewhat a Marissa Cooper but sadly with a less hot body) -- I tend to go for what's bad for me or what's shouldn't be for me anyway. In any case, I kind of find it amusing that the person bit the bait. Hah! Someday, someday, I will be more honest with myself, less stupid, and more realistic. Maybe then, I'll figure out that wifebeaters are really not for me.

I hate the way people reveal outright their personal issues that don't need to be aired in the first place. They rely on sympathy from people to drive them.

"event","When I ride the FX to commute, I always feel rather unsettled. It's as if one of these days, I just might be a victim of a hostage or a snatcher or a rapist. Call it extreme cynicism or what not, but for the past 12 years of my life or so, I have been exposed to a place of imbroglio compared to dull Singapore. In fact, the fear keeps on escalating as I continue to embark different journeys of my new commuting life versus my old commuting life in Singapore where a bus stop is a bus stop, a red traffic light is a red traffic light, and a ""no parking sign"" is a real ""no parking sign."" It's quite an awkward mix of desensitization and habituation where my fears are both overwhelming and bluntly blind. So every time I ride an FX, I immediately look for the religious paraphernalia sitting or hanging at dash board to find some comfort. <i>This</i> is a huge irony. Most of my friends understand that by now, I do not believe in a god, nor do I believe in any religious or spiritual existence. There might be something more to life, or we just might be reincarnates of animals or human bastards, but either way, they belong to the untouchable realm of (un)existence that shouldn't be sought to touch in the first place. However, seeing the religious icons seem to make me more at ease just because I seem to think that the religion of the driver might hold his and his passengers their morals together. It's like, when I look at religious icons, I feel a tinge of guilt and at the same time blasphemy, and I assume that they should too if they're going to do something wrong.

Am I feeling this comfort out of plain neediness or would I really have felt this way even before I became a non-believer?

When my parents tell me to pray, always, all the time, in the morning, in the evening, before meals, after meals, I can't help but just look somewhere else, think of another entertaining and yet totally irrelevant thought, and nod, as if I totally agree with what my parents say. When we go to church, I listen to the homily sometimes, but only shallowly. I feel this sort of perplexity for the people. Do they listen to the Word because they want to be good decent moral citizens? But can it be taught only through the Word of God?

It's a bit of an irony that I refuse to believe in a god because of it's extreme complexity leading to nowhere but yet, I still believe in equally complex things that leads to nowehere such as love or friendship. To be quite frank, in college, I've lost all certainties. I can't help but think whether my friends are really my friends. I can't help but think whether I'm in any way fit to be in a relationship or would I ever let myself in one anyway. In fact, I can't even help thinking whether I'm only thinking in a sort of non-mainstream way because I grew up uncool and so not in as a child (I was baduy, I admit).

The existence of life in itself is strange, but the way we live it is even stranger. We don't want ironies because they make us rudely inconsistent and yet, just right under our noses, we have this huge irony that we lug around subconciously everyday."

"event","Sometimes, I can't help but look back and think hard to try to understand how I've gotten in this position -- wandering vulnerably pulling off lackluster stunts that never get past a few seconds of fame. When I feel like I've finally done something special, someone takes away the spotlight and pulls off an even better stunt. No, this isn't about feeling stupidly unnoticed. This is about feeling stupidly mediocre most especially when you work your ass off and you get yourself no where. I can't help but feel like the universe conspires against me when I want something so badly. It's like I have this inherently notorious acquiesence to screwing up -- and this isn't just about me screwing up because I was stupid. This is about me screwing up because everyone around me <i>makes</i> me stupid.

Summer breaks are supposed to be relaxation time and enjoyment. I realized I've never really had a normal summer break since high school. My first two summers in high school, I was stuck with snot-nosed ballerinas (which I quite enjoyed but at the same time, had to work so hard). Then in my summer after third year high school, well, you know what happened in third year. After I graduated highschool, my parents laid out my cards for me... actually, they laid out ONE card for me (a wild card) that held the rest of my future. And now this.

Give me a break, please? Failure helps you appreciate success, I know. But what good would failure be if success was never to happen in the first place?"

People say that they hate circular argumentation. Why? Because they never lead to anything. I hate that too. People say that they hate round people. Why? Because they are not aesthetically pleasing. People say they hate mundane things, that they hate doing the same things over and over again. Why? Because it's boring.

They hate circles but do not realize that they live a circular life. They are brought up by figures, they normally go to school, work, have kids (or not), and die. The cases may be different but in the end, you know that the goals of each individual is simply to enhance their lifestyle then die. Even with our daily lives, we have a routine. We wake up, we eat and work, sleep. They say it's called homeostasis. Well, god almighty, if homeostasis was so great, why is it also so cyclic?

I want to do something out of this world, just for once, something that is so different from the circular world we all live in. I don't want to live in circles, I want to live in stars or hearts or diamonds. They're much prettier and unique than your usual circular life."

When people spoil his name, I tend to think, ""I'm glad it's over"" and it gives me this feeling of vindication for leaving. But when there are moments like this, I can't help feeling jealous or even caring for him. I'm tired of this already.

"event","Why is it that when we try to clean up our act, something always drives us back to the same old mess we were in? When we try to quit playing games, the world plays games with you until you give up and finally go back. When we try to quit some vice and when we're almost there, suddenly, something comes up and you know you just can't stop picking the vice once again. Why is it that when we try to finally be optimistic about things, the world gives you more reason to feel bad?

The concept of good and bad is something that I do not understand any more. They say that out of social convention, you create what is right and what is good. William James would put it in a pragmatist view -- that what is right and good is the one with the maximum cash value returned to us. But what if I say that wallowing in self pity would make me more comfortable, would it then be good that I do so? Who determines what is good? Who determines what is right? If the people are the ones who decide what is good and right, how come everything I do seems to be bad or wrong? Why can't the world be wise enough to concede that what is good right now is difficult to achieve and move along and make it easier for us? I'm sick and tired of hearing the line of reasoning that if everything was right in front of us, we wouldn't enjoy life. Bull crap. The bad and the wrong are right in front of me, they're right in front of so many people, and yet, it still seems so much more appealing than what is good and right.

There are so many things that I do not understand in this world. It drives me mad that I do not know and cannot know what the underlying principle of life. Life bothers me. Society disturbs me greatly. The cycle of society is foolishly cruel. We study hard to get a good job, we get a good job to allow our children to study well. To stray away from this cycle would make you useless. It would make you suffer more under the same cycle.

Perhaps sometimes, looking before we leap isn't any more a good idea. It makes us question too much that we begin to hate what's beautiful in life. Is this the way I'd want to live anyway? To live in a world of darkness where nothing else seems worthy enough to appreciate? Maybe my teachers in grade school and high school were wrong. Maybe they were all telling me lies. Maybe this time, I should learn that it isn't so stupid to leap before I look. After all, what's one failure? Too bad, with all the lies, they actually taught me the one truth, the answer to the question. It's pretty simple -- EVERYTHING."

I'm done with playing, I'm done with all those games that have just left me weary. The problem with having to play the game of non-serious people is that every time you're about to win, you lose something and it makes you feel emptier than you already are. Somewhere along the journey, you just realize that while there's nothing left to lose, there's also nothing left to gain, and <i>that</i> makes everything so pointless. But now that I'm out of the game, I realize that so many people are stuck in the middle of nowhere. I am. It's an irony to be serious. You're serious but nobody else is. It's not pointless, sure. You do get something from it. But while you wait for the opportunity to come, you're on a boat ride to no where... alone.

I'm over with last time. It's easy to accept the fact that there are people who are not meant to stay. But my fear now is that while I wait for someone to finally notice my open window, I just might get tired of the wind and close the door. It's hard to live in Zion. The Matrix of playing games seems so much better. But when you know that in the Matrix, nothing you touch is real, you'd rather that you stay asleep, dreamless. This way, you're neither in reality or in hyperreality."

***

My mom told me the other night that I was such a pessimist. I was battling it out initially with her but after she left for some party, I realized, I actually am. I have no idea how my cynicism has worsened through the years. I've decided to have a change of perception.

***

What should I be expecting from crushes? Or at least, mutual crush things? After my last relationship, I'm not even expecting anything from any one any more. It would be nice to have that old feeling back but somehow having a crush now seems so far away from really loving a person. Or at least, it seems so far away from how I loved <i>him</i> so much before.

What should I be expecting from boys who pretty much qualify as your classic <i>crush ng bayan</i> who could probably get any girl he wants? But then, am I being too paranoid? What should he be expecting from a girl who has a tendency to get spoiled by the guys from before that she's liked?

***

I miss my high school barkada now. I miss how we could easily talk about anything. No frills. Somehow, college has been so different. UP has this thing for making people feel liek they're fish out of water. And to be honest, I feel like I've been caught in the ""Mean Girls"" crowd. They're not bad. Sometimes, they're even downright silly that it's fun to be with them. It's just that ""mean girls"" like to talk... A LOT. They talk about fashion, they talk about this girl and that girl, they talk about everything under the sun. And yes, I like talking, but not to the extent that I leave my personal thoughts exposed. Maybe it's because I'm afraid to be the defenseless fourth-grader once again. Maybe that's why I'm so paranoid. But I can't be blamed. ""Mean Girls"" love talking about everyone behind their backs, somehow, I can't find a reason why they can't talk about me behind my back.

***

I spent three hours all by myself in school last Friday. I felt like the biggest loser not having anyone with me. Feeling alone when you're with people seems much of a better idea now that literally being alone and feeling alone.

***

Maybe I'm finally over <i>him</i>. It's just that I feel so burned out and numb that I can't seem to find someone else. Last week my cousin said, ""usually we have alternative boys to catch us after a bad event. I think after ****, the reason why I felt empty was because I was finally FINALLY boyless."" And I guess that's exactly what's making things worse. That finally, FINALLY, I'm actually boyless. It's pretty funny now that I study in a co-ed school, I end up with no one. Back when I was in my exclusive high school, I was in control.

***

It's a bit ironic though, I've never looked for a guy (or a girl *snicker*) in my school. Aside from the low population of good-looking guys (under my standards, of course) in school, I just can't seem to find a personality that appeals to me. Maybe wifebeater, yeah. But it's silly because the only reason why I like him is because he's so mysterious and he has the potential of pulling off a Howard Roard scene.

It would be fun to raid the Ateneo boys but I study so far away. No worries, I'll be nearer next school year."

"event","When I was a little girl, I'd imagine myself to be Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty and I'd wait for my Prince Charming until he finally comes. And just like the story would end, I'd expect that I'd live ""happily ever after"" as well. Only, I didn't know what happily ever after entailed. What happens after you find him? What do you do when you find yourself with him ever after?

From little stories you grow up with to the sappy romantic novelas you watched, there finally comes a point in time when you realized you were old enough to understand what Lady Love felt when she saw her Mister Man. And since then, you've been looking for the one. He may just be that hunky boy next door or that silent outcast sitting beside you in class, sometimes, you expect him to find you, but mostly, we expect ourselves to find him.

You admire, you love, you get hurt. That's the cycle you patiently bear just to finally have that one moment where you break free from it. You think that fairytales and ""A Walk to Remember"" scenes will finally come true for you. But sometimes, you just get tired. You think why in the world are you expecting superficiality. Then you look at all the people around you, happy and in love. That's when it hits you hard. You know that it's more than just finding Prince Charming. You're lonely. And all this time, it wasn't about expecting Mister Man that made you bear the cycle. It was the fact that at some point, once you've tasted a little bit of love from someone, you want it even more. You feel angered and depressed for feeling so inadequate and unsatisfied. That's when you start the cycle all over again.

This is the danger of dreaming about you having possibilities with someone. It makes you want the feeling even more. Yet we know now that this is exactly what makes us stuck in the same rut we've been all along.

Dreams can be wonderful sometimes, when it makes us have wings or gives us a break from all that hustling and bustling in work. But when they seem too real, that's when I start to feel afraid. Somehow, it seems more enticing to just get it on with and follow the rules of fools.

Two notecards down, three left to go. I've got to finish this by 2PM so that I can get to school early just for a debate round. I need to borrow some books from the library and copy my outline on Sir Mikee's desk. Then I have to do the paraphrasing thing for comm when I get home and study at least one chapter in my Psych book.

I really do hope we won't have classes on Friday because the friggin psych exam is four chapters long. Plus my pol sci exam is on Thursday and my Geo exam is on Saturday. Good luck to me. My brain's about to explode.

Hate exams. They make me feel so stupid. Bleh."

"event","She drives everyone mad, that incredible half-asleep woman, who wanders aimlessly around the campus with swinging arms and a silly bouncy gait. As she approaches you, smiling like an idiot, you feel ten years younger. There's something about her that makes you feel so young and stupid. ""She's such a kid"", you tell yourself, slightly annoyed that she never seems serious. Or that she's so weird.

She goes to class, like any normal student, except for the fact that she's half-asleep as she walks to the room and permanently injected with a weird mix of an upper and downer.

With that personality, everyone assumes she doesn't care about the world, or at least what people think about her.

But she does.

And she's always too afraid to think of what people say about her.

So she pretends she doesn't care at all.

But she wishes she knew what the others would say, most especially what her everyday man would about her, the guy she bumps into at times, the one she admires secretly while everyone else fades away from her world. And she waits for that day that he'll say something she'd want to hear.

But she's scared...

...to hear anything at all.

And thus, the incredible semi-sleeping woman, is not so incredible after all."

"event","What is it with being single?

You have this illusion that somehow, you're free to fall in love with anyone, but you know that the chances of something happening is very slim. You feel lonely most of the time and wish you'd have someone and get on with it already... but when you're in a relationship, you miss the adventure and experiment. You hate the fact that you're single but then you like how it sounds when your crush asks you if you have a boyfriend. You enjoy the liberties of doing crazy things with people but you know that you'd also just want to do it with someone special. You look for someone you can settle down with and enjoy life at that moment but you know you're also too tired of being serious and caring and getting damaged from your last relationship.

What is it with wanting to be in a relationship when you're single but wanting out when taken?

It's very silly and very embarrassing to admit but it actually feels pathetically desperate and yet obsessed when you actually have a crush on someone. It makes you feel so <i>kilig</i> and yet so down at the same time.

What is it with torpe guys?

They leave you hanging and frustrated. And then when you're over them, sometimes, that's the only time they admit things to you.

What is it with couples?

They kill me. Like how they rub in how madly in love they are when you're bitter, frustrated, and frazzled. Or when you feel that after that last break up, no one will ever love you or see you that way again.

What is it with social conventions that tell you how to act, what to feel, who to feel for, and what to do? They just make me feel worse than I'm already feeling right now."

"event","It's bad enough that until now, you can't tell me your problems, that I still don't know what your issues are, or what the hell is up with you, but to not tell me and tell someone else instead is just worse. You expect that someone else will tell me things for you, you expect that I'll suddenly understand, or that I'm some great person who has telepathic powers and does not need communication.

No, you're just sick. That night when we were supposed to talk, the night I needed you the most, the night you left me for a sorry bastard drinking party where you made me wait up for hours and eventually not showing up, that night was the night you told me you loved me. I was SO CLOSE to telling you that I loved you too. But I waited. I didn't want you to gloat with glee thinking that you've already taken a hold on me. I wanted you to understand exactly what I felt and what I was thinking.

That night, I realized I didn't need you. That when I woke up the next day, I was okay, that I managed not to kill myself. And to think, I was thinking the night before, ""I want to die early. I can just kill myself now, grab a knife and stab myself. The pain wouldn't hurt me. But it's the what if's with you that would."" But no, you leave me hanging, thinking that I'm okay, that everything's okay, and that I can be the person you just hang out with when you're bored and when there's nothing else to do, or when just for the sake of saying you're with someone, you need someone to formally prove it with.

I've learned things these past few weeks. Do I love you? Yes, I do. But if I can't be part of your life, then it's not worth it. Because love doesnt require you to lose respect for yourself or to make you feel like some sacrificial lamb in the end.

Does it always have to be some special occasion that I get to talk to you? It's pathetic. But these past few months have been like shit and you know it. You've badmouthed me, you've stood me up, you've even made me look bad in front of my cousin. Anger is no excuse for that. I've never called you foul names. You tell everyone else how mad you are or how frustrated you are, but you don't tell me.

And so maybe this is just fair that I shut you out of my life. That finally, I'm not going to wait for you to tell me your frustrations because I myself am frustrated with you for not being there for me.

You have your life, I have mine. That's the way things are going to be from now one.

"event","The funny thing about sleep is that it doesn't come at the right time for me. A few days ago, I panicked realizing that it was 4 AM and that I had to go to get my beauty sleep. SO, I lay down on my bed, shut my eyes, thought of nice things to dream of, only to realize that up until 6 AM, I was still not yet sleepy. I managed to fall asleep at around 6:30 however and got a good 5 hours sleep! The next night, I decided that oh well, since I can't sleep, I'll let it be. So I didn't force myself to bed... I slept at surprise surprise 5 AM and woke up at 11! Yipee! I slept an hour earlier and got 60 minutes more of beauty sleep. Then finally, last night, I fell asleep at around 7 PM and I woke up at 11 PM, ERGO I couldn't sleep. I was wide awake. I did try warm milk, hot cocoa, dilis, chocolate, cold water, reading a book, watching TV, using the internet, yet NO, I couldn't fall asleep.

And it's 8 AM now, and still, I haven't gotten my sleep. Maybe I'll just take a power nap in the afternoon after I do my book review, then, leave for my cousin's house in Alabang and well, party all night.

Only, I don't want to go out because I sort of do not want to dress up. I need new clothes. And I feel bad re-using my old clothes. :( I did get a top from Adidias though yesterday and abused Sandro's 30% off for relatives. I might get more clothes from Adidas next time. I don't know. Maybe.

I really should stop blowing my money away. I got a CD yesterday and since it wasn't your normal P450 CD (it was P580), well, it did burn a whole in my wallet. Along with my top. And my jacket.

This is crazy.

Materialism kills me.

Sadly and unfortunately, due to my obsession with burning candles in my room and while taking a bath (it's a quirk but also very very helpful), my lighter's died out. I can't find my butane gas refill although I was thinking of getting a better and prettier lighter next week. And concealer, course, since my eye bags are now horrible due to insomnia.

Somehow, the past few days have been boring, and yet, I'm okay with it. I like locking myself up in the room, reading books (you'll be surprised at how much books I've managed to read this break), and wishing on more material objects for my guilty pleasure.

Welcome to 3sa's life, where sleep is unheard of and money is pissed down the drain (as if she ever does have enough -- and THAT's why she's so poor)."

Christmas came and went. My father was hysterical this morning. I didn't get much money. I didn't really enjoy it. Halfway through the day, I wanted to go back home and just keep to myself.

I am still not ready to go back to school on the 2nd. For starters, I only have four books on the Beatles and the counterculture. Glenn's in Ireland so the two books aren't with me. I don't have any magazine sources yet. And I haven't even read my book for the book review I'm supposed to do (Well, I have -- eons ago -- and trust me, it was boring).

It's funny enough how some people think you're Miss Popularity when you're absolutely not. It's all a joke. Most especially if you feel like the loneliest person on this planet with apparently no friend to lean on. Or when you know that they talk about you behind your back.

Or maybe it's just becaue you're completely in-over-your-head paranoid.

Perhaps.

The worst part about ending 2005 is not that everything is just so wrong. I've gotten used to that when I was 10. That was when I realized everything was just bullshit. The worst part is when you want to end the year by answer math problems on your module.

You wave to him as you turn to the corner where he incidentally stayed.

He doesn't have that close up smile.
He's not your tall, dark, and handsome idol.
He's no Prince Charming to begin with.

As all things are filled with my soul
You emerge from the things
Filled with my soul
You are like my soul
A butterfly of dream
And you are like the word: Melancholy

Your silence is that of a star
As remote and candid

I am sad. There is nothing here on earth that could make me happy...not at night. But I love the night. I don't know why. There's this certain closeness with silence that I share at this hour.

I don't know how to love myself anymore. Sometimes, I pray to Kuya Jess but I don't feel like I'm being heard. It hurts me to say this but I'm having my doubts. I don't want it but I'm having it.

Mahar's right. I should try to think of why I'm so happy and not why I'm so cynical. But when I'm happy, I'm not myself. It's weird.

One day, I'd like to go away...to some place far where there are little people. People think of me as a people person...maybe I am. But most of the time, I'd rather be alone.

I'm a loner. Loneliness is my best friend."

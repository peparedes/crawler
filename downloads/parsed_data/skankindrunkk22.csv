"event","for the beginning of 2009 it was continued forward from a psychotic late 2008 iam the age 20. Wasn't a influential era but an experience from the world i stepped in. a chaotic blur but, unstressed from everything that was content around me, friends, nature, unkown beings from the thought as turned into friends. Such Putrid exaggeration that went beyond my boundaries of saying anything to that person. For Iam a format of the success of this future. As though it continued with a lust of saturation from sanctuary I gained some sort of knowledge that holding this possession is also a substance of naturing the labor of your brain. You see, Basically A collision course to envying and sinning to the unnatural.

A couple Of broads. If so, thats the only contemplation going on in mind, but in that case i just forgive it.
as an extension of so many shows, and a couple of earliest 2008 bands coming up in the chain for our history; CANNABIS CORPSE, SABERTOOTH ZOMBIE, RAMMING SPEED, PURPLE MERCY, HEAVY HILLS, EMCEE REEFUS SO'CAL As my favorites and continuing on. Caught up with Tiger Uppercut for 6 years since theyve played!!!!!!!!!

2010 holds many to come, and im probably in for a treat or wasted for the accused or Death beyond Sequel.

im in the process of learning how to achieve good moonshine with my cousin jason. and will probably slang it for 20cents a bottle. ive already tasted the outcome and its soooooo good. cant wait. i almost went on a road trip to idaho with my other relative aaron. but id rather fly over there and spend my nights drinking whiskey. since thats all there is to over there.
other than that, nothing really much. just working and having alot of whiskey nights.
the obituary show was really sick. got to stage dive and puke my brains till they kicked me out. bought a badass beanie.
3 nights later i get into a car accident with jordan,steff, and some other broad with enormous boobage. but yeah, jordan decided to be a douche on the road and ended up skidding on the highway for a good 20ft,then ran into a fence along with a bush tree and flipped on its side. what a ride. no belts whatsoever. i should be dead.haha
im bruised on my right shoulder. thats about it.

i cheated death or something like that one more time.
i dont know if there's a third chance but, i hope i never know if i should sense it.
my good friend eljker died last night in a car accident coming back from moon cadillac show in SF and almost towards home, he fell asleep on the wheel and turned the car over. i was suppose to attend with all those fools. why cant i choose to go? or is it fate.
reminds me when tammy asked to come with her to that stupid party in Prunedale or montery and we would of came back to alex's after. no, i said. i cant, because im holding everyones bottle of booze in my backpack. so i stayed. and the next morning its a whole different awakening. what a reality check it has on me. 
my theory is.....i will watch everyone go until im ready to say ""its ok"".....


im going to miss that fool everytime i spend it with the hernandez brothers.
where's that fugger at? eliminated from the content situation that future life will live long and prosper. but will he dwell??? nope.

"event","The world is like a ride at an amusement park. And when you choose to go on it, you think that it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. [Audience member shouts 'bollocks'] There is a lot denial in this ride, the ride, in fact, is made up of denial ""All things work in Goatboys favour"". 

The world is like a ride at an amusement park. It goes up and down and round and round. It has thrills and chills and it's very brightly coloured and it's very loud and it's fun, for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question, is this real, or is this just a ride? And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, they say, ""hey - don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because, this is just a ride...

"" And we... kill those people. 

Ha ha ""Shut him up."" ""We have a lot invested in this ride. Shut him up. Look at my furrows of worry. Look at my big bank account and my family. This just has to be real."" Just a ride. But we always kill those good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok. Jesus mudered; Martin Luther King mudered; Malcolm X murdered; Gandhi murdered; John Lennon murdered; Reagan.... wounded. But it doesn't matter because: It's just a ride. And we can change it anytime we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings and money. A choice, right now, between fear and love. 

The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love, instead, see all of us as one. Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take all that money that we spend on weapons and defences each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would many times over, not one human being excluded, <> And we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace. Thank you very much, you've been great. [Applause] I hope you enjoyed it."

if there really is a morbid soul in you. but thats how the ground decodes the idea.
which type of consciousness will you surrender? 
lets make contact, beyond living in this bullshit system and traveling when its on tv.
lets behead one another to spread loving and seduction foreplay.
im fully aware of my surroundings, and im sure you all are too. follow an instrustion or instinct? stand or sit. walk to the other side where its cold and strange."

Full of zest, but no appeal 
Ever want to cry so much 
You want to die 
Ever feel that you've been had 
Had so much that you turn mad 
Ever been depressed that 
(to) those you turn to, you bring distress 
Ever sit in tormenting silence 
That turns so loud, you start to scream 
Ever take control of a dream 
And play all the parts and set all the scenes 
Ever do nothing and gain nothing from it 
Ever feel stupid and then know that you really are 
Ever think you're smart and then find out you aren't 
Ever play the fool and then find out that you're worse 
Ever look at a flower and hate it 
Ever see a couple kissing and get sickened by it 
Ever wish the human race didn't exist 
And then realize you're one too 
Well, have you ... ever .. I have

sensible twilight to the mountain but cant grasp the top.

a creepy tree or a body full of imaginary venom with blow.
tongs to grab my hands. grease to let me flow down.
confined sanctuary of ones domain can lead to nowhere.

where are you? when i need you.

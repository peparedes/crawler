I have so much stress as far as financial survival but you know what....it still doesn't stop me from enjoying every day that i am here and (almost) every new twist and turn my life is taking. 

I am very sorry to all my family back home..... i know how much I miss all of you, and i know that you miss us just as much, I love every one of you.....but I finally realized something.

 It is my life,and Sarah's life and we can live it the way we want. I am smart and resourceful and stubborn. I am a good person and a good mother. I deserve a good life and I am going to work hard and do whatever it takes to have that life. i am not bragging..... Anyone who knows me knows that I have had low self esteem for most of my life. i have always put myself down and been my own worst enemy. I have learned to love myself and it feels very good.

I found my home. I don't think I will ever leave Kelowna, I love it here and so does Sarah. I really hope that everyone in my family realizes how happy i am here(come and visit me).... I really think I have reached a turning point in my life."

tommorow is my moving day. The last two months has been pure hell!! i worked my last day today and I think it was my hardest day yet. I got the feeling that Lynn was really mad at me for leaving even though her mate is working with her now and it means more money in her pocket. 

So as of midnight tommorow....I have no home and no job. Only my car and my daughter. I am scared shitless that i will not be able to care for sarah properly, I have no idea what to do when I get to Winnipeg but councelling and schooling are probably my best bet. I have no idea how to go about it but as grannie would have said... it will all come out in the wash.

I decided to take the month of July off and not worry about it. I have not had a vacation or a rest in so many years I can't remember what it means. Staying a week in Kelowna, and maybe a day or two in Sparwood(so sarah can see her dad) and then hopefully spend some time with my mother and brother and sister. I know i just saw them at the wedding but it has been so long since we could just sit and relax together.

I am sorry this is so long, i haven't written in a long time and i can't sleep tonight."

still going through shit with Dave, I thought we were doing pretty good just being friends, but then he turned on me again. I should have known not to let my guard down over him he would just hurt me again.

what kills me the most is he is the one always ""getting pissed off"" and i am always ""pissing him off"" he is the one with the anger management problem, and yet I am the bad guy.

I have 2 weeks left to get ready to leave here, and now i have no more reservations about leaving. It will still tear my heart out as i have called this place home for 2 years or more and i thought i had found the place for me to live and be happy.

looking forward to meeting my new niece Leeya for the first time, she should be out of hospital by then. I am sure she will do wonders for mending my broken heart.

I would feel like a fool walking into any pub or bar by myself. I have been trying to get over this for over a month now and every weekend, i end up doing nothing but staying home and being miserable alone. 

Maybe it is bugging me more this weekend because i know dave is partying with friends tonight, and i used to go with him. I would love to see jay again but he is dave's friend and to me is off-limits. I already learned from many previous encounters with his friends that none of them feel comfortable around me.

i want to make friends and have people who care about me to hang around with on days off, to go to the beach with or for a coffee, or anything. I want to so badly but something always seems to stop me. i keep telling myself that i will make friends after i move, it's only a month away, but i am scared that i will continue to not let people close to me even after i move

asked sarah again about her live journal and why she doesn't use it anymore, she said ""it's boorring"" ah well another thing she said ""oh cool can i have one? this is so neat!!"" and then quickly moved on to other things. she is mostly into neopets now.

conflcting thoughts in my head driving me crazy, and even though i feel I am doing the right thing leaving here it is tearing my heart apart. I spent so many years, and sacrificed so many things and worked so hard to move here, to stay here and to take care of myself here. And after all that i have nothing to show for it. 

I get so mad at dave sometimes, and i understand now why he gets so mad at me . I think we are both angry that the future that we  envisioned for ourselves together is not going to happen. I want to blame him for the situation I am in now and yet I know it is not his fault, i am an adult and i make my own decisions. It just hurts so much when i think of all the things we could have done together. This drive will hurt more than just my back, but my soul as well knowing that i will be doing it without him traveling with us to our new future, but alone with my daughter a single mom yet again."

So today she went in for an eye exam and her perscription had changed drastically requiring new lenses. so I sprung for the extra cash and bought her a pair of nice frames for 150 bucks. not a bad price for a decent pair.

lenscrafters was really decent with her, fitted her perfectly and with the total cost coming to 220 bucks i was happy that she got a bottle of cleaner, a cleaning cloth, and a case thrown in. Hopefully she will be good for another year, and damn she looks good.

made her feel very good about herself to look good, and she was impressed at how much money i spent on her, i was glad to see her accept the little ego boost"

Should make for a great paycheck though. sometimes I look at how much money i make here in the summer and i really think about staying, but then i rememebr the lean times in the winter when i only had a day or two during the week to work. Pretty slim pickings.


i get paid tommorow so I am happy and since i don't have to pay rent at the end of the month, I am thinking about taking her tommorow to buy a better pair of frames that fit her properly and get a second set of glasses made for her. These ones really get in her way, and drive her crazy

i will now write the final chapter of my story of dave. i still love him in a sad kind of way, i think i always will. No matter how bad it got with him, while i was with him i slowly learned that i could love myself, and that i am still an attractive woman. I also learned that i deserve alot better than what he had to offer me. I should find a person who is willing and capable of giving back to me as much or more than i give....A person who is not only capable of taking care of himself, but also independant and mature enough to have a serious relationships without all the hang-ups and insecurities. Pretty large order I know, but I am willing to take my time, and do alot of ""shopping"" before i make a big decision like this again. I don't ever want to lose my independance and control over my life again.

I tried to make peace with dave before i moved to winnipeg, and was (i thought) making progress, we were meeting for coffee and talking a little bit, with a few hugs thrown in. i saw him the day before i left for my sisters wedding and we were ok. after I came back all i got was silence, and no contact while i was away either, not even an email. I finally got an email today from him and it hurt. He does not wish any further contact, just wants me to go away. i will go away, i just regret that i will be sad when i think of him, and the way it ended.

this is going to be a long lonely month, waiting and getting ready to leave here. i can't even describe how i feel right now there are too many emotions.....the only thing that i consoled myself with coming back here for this month was that i might get to see him a few times before i move, and it hurts that he percieves me the way he does. 

gas prices here are insanly high..it was at 90.5 when i left for winnipeg, it was at 94.5 when i got home a week later, today it went up to 96.5 and it is supposed to go to a dollar or more tommorow. crazy days ahead. I will be riding my bike alot this month if i want to be able to afford to drive out of here at the end of the month."

Sarah remarked to me today as we were getting off the plane in kelowna, coming around the last corner to see a crowd of people waiting to greet family, ""there is nobody here to meet us"" and i said that's because we have no family or friends here.

snow storm in winnipeg this week, record breaking snowfall, has been quite an adventure with flights being cancelled and highways being closed, but despite all the difficulties this is the happiest I have been in a long time. So far have recieved many many wonderful real hugs even a BEAR hug from Dallas that cracked my back beautifully.

I have never seen my mother so happy, and I am so looking forward to getting to know my mother in a new way, as adult to adult. I was still a child when i moved away, and she means so much to me.

"event","well i am still alive, and starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. thanks to anyone who was reading all my whining crap, it has been a help to vent. my mom and dad raised me tough I will be ok in the end.

i still think about him alot but the paralyzing feeling of utter frustration and despair is starting to slowly wear off. I know it will still take a few weeks but i hope i get over it sooner than later.

i have alot to do in the next few weeks. really looking forward to seeing my family in a few weeks from now. time is still creeping slowly for me, i wish it would speed up and be the end of june so i can get the hell out of here!"

"event","well that just about sums it up. I am falling apart. every day that he does not contact me i fall deeper and deeper into into depression and despair. I can not go from loving someone as much as i love him to being completly cut off the next day. I don't even care how horrible he was to me I would give anything just for one hug from him. just to know that he doesn't hate me"

"event","another day goes by and I wonder what I am doing here, I am lost and confused most of the time, unable to make simple decisions or maybe just unwilling. I am still grieving over what happend and the stupid mistakes i made. I am not completly blameless in this breakup and i wish i could turn back the clock and change alot of things i said and did. 

i pray that i get the chance to tell him these things and ask him to make peace with me, I am so scared that I will carry this around as extra baggage if I don't find some closure. I want us both to be happy, but i feel as though i won't be happy again until i know that he won't remember me in such a bad way for the rest of his life. it still hurts me that sarah's father feels so much animosity against me(after 4 years). My sis told me I should not care what other people think of me but the people i love or have loved, i do care, i can't explain it i just do."

"event","still battling with myself, had a good cry today on the phone with my sister, she has been the best to me this week. Amazing how she can be there for me even though she is so far away. 

a former version of myself would be bothered by the fact that my baby sister is acting more like my older sister and i am not in a position of authority as the ""oldest"" but now I am just grateful she is there for me and grateful that I can talk to her as an adult and be on eaqual ground with her. i must be getting old.

the next few months are going to be hard for me, having to stay here until sarah is finished school is going to be really hard when all i really want to do is run away.

my daughter will be 12 in a few days, she's been a real trooper helping me cope through this really hard breakup. i try not to cry in front of her but sometimes a memory will pop up out of nowhere and suprise me with a few tears.

i don't hate him, i was enraged at him but i learned a few years ago how to not hold a grudge and i am not even really angry at him anymore. I am so sorry that it happened this way, i really want to apologize to him for the way i treated him, and i just want to make peace with him before i leave. I don't want this horrible baggage and all that anger and agression to follow me. I don't want him back but I do still love him and care about him and i only want the best for him......maybe i shouldn't care but then i wouldn't be me."

well it was a rough three days but that's all i am willing to grieve for him. I have my internet hooked up, I have a phone hooked up, if anyone wants to call me just ask for my number  he he he
all  his stuff is gone everything on his list that he asked for, plus more of his crap that he didn't ask for. I took it to his friends house and left it there for him to pick up tommorow. Will be a nervous day for me because i know he will be in the neighborhood tomorrow. I hope he doesn't (I hope he does shhhhhh) come by the house.

shit i am still battling with my stupid emotional brain,but i definitely do not want him to come back. maybe in a few weeks from now we can have a coffee and talk. maybe it's better if i never see him again, but i would prefer to remember  him smiling when i leave here..... we did share alot of love, and intimacy. damn i wish he was here just for a few minuits to crack my back for me, it aches all the time."

i have 5 mins left on ths comp then i get booted off! 

shit happens  i love him/i hate him/ i am so lonely

i feel so alone with no family anywhere close by, he was all i had here. so i will be very glad to move back home where i belong with my family as soon as sarah finished this school year. i should never have left, nothing but troubles for me. maybe moving home will make things alot better!

love you all  talk at you tommorow"

i survived the day and i have some peace and quiet. I have my keys and can lock my door. now just to put my life back together and start all over, i can't wait to get the hell out of this province."

"event","well i am at the library right now i lucked out and got a computer for an hour. fuck i hate not having a phone,having no computer at the same time just makes it even worse. sarah was playing happily at the school park when i went to go get her after school, dave had already been and gone leaving a mess behind *sighs* there is still alot of his stuff for me to clean up, i fight the weepies anything i pick up something of his. his mom was with him so nothing got trashed but it was pretty devastating to come home to, at least he wasn't there. i haven't seen him since our fight this morning and i wonder if i ever will. 

he gave the keys to the landlord to give to me when i got home it was quite embarrassing for me, but at least they didn't say anything to me. they have heard us fight i am sure and i always hated living there, now it is worse with just me and sarah, maybe i will find a small cheap apartment to live in i don't know, moving shit by myself is hard. i can do it but have to decide if it is worth it

it might be worth it just to get away from all the memories that place has over the last year. fuck fuck fuck fuck! sometimes i really hate my life. I really love him and i really hate him at the same time, while my rational mind tells me not to worry i will get over him, my emotional mind plays tricks with me stabbing into the sweete memories of good times we had together and all the good times we had planned that will now never happen(i think that is what hurts the most) 

will have a phone in 2 or three days, maybe by tommorow. i found an ad in the newspaper for pre paid telephone service (suits me fine don't care if it costs more) came her to go online to order the service, supposed to pay by money order looked at the adress.....it's on the same street i work so i am going to see if i can speed up the service by going in directly tommorow and paying cash.

will try again later this evening in about an hour to call you oon the phone, I really need a voice right now. i know you have the weight of the world on your shoulders, but with mom sick you are the only one i have to talk to thatnk you so much for being here for me, i am so lonely and isolated i hate being trapped here! sarah is a great comfort to me and is keeping me going (she's a tough girl) but she is still just a child and there are so many things i just can't talk to her about.

i will be online sporadically over the next while but will post in my journal every chance i get, internet is free at the library it is just hard to get a machine sometimes. that and this machine doesn't have instant messenger arggggggggggggggggggggg!

Don't worry mom and dad raised us tough, I'll be ok and so will sarah i just have to find myself again."

"event","well shit
i was leaving you a message on your phone(sister rose) and mine got cut off. Dave moves fast i guess. we got in a scrap today, i am so fucking stupid, he kept me up all night and woke sarah up at 2 am. i have had almost no sleep and i got thrown around pretty good this morning at 6 am, i have a bleeding cut/scrape on my leg and bruises on all my arms.
 
apparently i have no phone now as well, because it is dead, it went deal while i was leaving you a message.internet will  be next i am sure, he will do everything now that he can to make my life miserable. fuck now how am i supposed to call my mom!!!!!!!!!
 
i phoned the police after he left, i will be going there today at 5:30 to make a statement, they will probably want to press charges. scared shitless and so is sarah and that pisses me off more than anything.   
i wish i could get a cell phone, but most likely i will not be able to. not sure what's going to happen now, but i have crossed a line that i am sure you know can not be crossed back over, i called 911 this morning...... he will always hate me and any chance of a peaceful seperation is gone.
 
well i have to go to work now and pretend like nothing is wrong, and i am soo sore, my arms are all bruised. have no idea what is goingto happen, i cvan't believe i was so stupid to fall for his act again. he really thinks he has paid his way living here for the last year, we have been lliving together since last february, he worked end of july to december12  then worked february till now 8 months he lived with me and had no income.......you figure it out.  I am going to get screwed again but it doesn't matter as long as i have sarah and she is not hurt i will be ok. sorry for the inturruption in the phone message, if you got it at all that is. he is such a prick i fucking hate him now.
 
please call me, and don't tell mom what's going on she has enough to worry about already.
 
love you
Sheri"

"event","I woke up this morning and ""tripped"" over the easter basket that the easter bunny ""forgot"" in my room....dumb bunny, he got the wrong room! I was feeling pretty run down last night.

My mother is still in the hospital. I don't really know what is wrong with her but i do know she is quite ill, and being sedated. She has trouble breathing and speaking. My sister tells me she is not eating well either. I spoke with the nurse taking care of her and the tone of her voice was to me very worried. 

it is  hard being so far away and not being able to go see her, very frustrating, all I can do is wait and see what happens.... maybe now is a good time for me to start praying.

I try to make light of it for my daughter's sake, no need to worry her unnecessarily, but it does weigh heavily on my mind."

Damn my mom is in the hospital! nothing life threatening, but it is so frustrating being so far away and not being able to go visit her. only a month until I fly back home for my little sister's wedding. my dad is not doing well physically either, and it scares the shit out of me thinking about not having my parents alive and healthy. 

I have been away from home for so long, I wonder if perhaps it has been too damn long. I missed alot of years i should have been spending with my family, and i regret that they missed so much of sarah's childhood. hope i can make it up to them sharing her adolescence with them! 

Moving back home is going to be a big adjustment for me, i hope i can get used to living in the prairies again after a few years of soft living in the beautiful okanagan valley."

I do carry most of what grandma taught me(I still can't make pastry like she did) but i just can't latch on to the faith that they both had in god. 

I had a dream and they were happy together in heaven, but they didn't see me here on earth and for that I am glad. 

Grandpa I promise to always keep your turtles alive, to always tell stories to children, and if I ever do have a garden again, I will  pull all the weeds!

Grandma I promise to never stop trying to make apple pie the way you taught me, and i have kept the promise i made to you the last time I saw you....I have forgiven him, and accepted him the way he is. I put away pride and broke the silence."

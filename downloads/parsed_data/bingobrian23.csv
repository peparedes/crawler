"event","wow the manchurian candidate sucks. don't make the mistake bianca steve and i did tonight. (oh and steve says don't see the village either.) movies i've seen this summer

the manchurian candidate: C-
spiderman 2: B
mean girls: A
harry potter: A
fahrenheit 9/11: A-
anchorman: B+
the terminal: C-
troy: B
saved!: A
supersize me: B+

movies i'd like to see: 
napoleon dynamite
harold and kumar go to white castle
shrek 2
the bourne supremacy
maria full of grace
garden state

so back to the topic at hand. while reviews of the manchurian candidate were generally favorable, we, the viewers, had some serious problems with the lack of closure at the end. for instance (spoilers ahead)---------- why did denzel not shoot the president-elect? why suddenly would he have been able to stop himself? and why did manchurian global want to put a ""sleeper"" in the white house anyway? they seemed to be plenty powerful already. and how could meryl's little tirade actually have gotten the committee to change their nomination for the vice-presidential candidate like five minutes before it was to be announced. a lot of the movie just seemed plain nonsense. 

bottom line: don't see manchurian candidate unless you want to be confused and disturbed"

"event","so i just finished watching the convention coverage with bianca julia and erich. i'm finally convinced that kerry has what it takes. i can't believe the networks covered so little of the convention. from 9-10, the hour before john kerry spoke, there were so many good things to see and hear, especially alexandra kerry and then the video, although vanessa kerry sucked. i can't believe ABC execs feel that they can justify showing extreme makeover when such an important part of the american political process, which happens only once every four years is going on live. as sam would say, my goodness, my gracious."

"event","I just read Steve's xanga and felt obliged (or is it inspired?) to post. I saw Anchorman tonight which was fucking hysterical. The most I've laughed in awhile, except for everytime I see Bianca of course. Literally, the last time I was at Bianca's house, like five minutes later we were literally rolling on the floor laughing in the office and I can't even remember about what. And its always like that, I love it. Anyways, work's been good, I've been good. Sylvia's been good (She's looking forward to taking a couple days off next week to fly to Michigan to watch like 14 yr olds ice skate...) I'm going to Long Island/Larchmont this weekend with my darling Amy K. to see Kristin, Steph, and Sam, and it's going to be ridiculous. I'm taking a day off this week and going to the beach, and I went on Sunday too. It was the most perfect beach day ever, then all day today it fucking rained and was like shit of course. 

So I'm reading this book now, ""The Runaway British Bestseller"" it's called Eats, Shoots, and Leaves and it's all about punctuation and grammar. The writer is really tongue-in-cheek about the whole thing, but sometimes she gets so worked up, especially about signs, which I suppose she believes stimulates grammatical inaccuracy in the unwashed masses or something. I'm also reading Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions, which I like so far. 

As to my latest addiction, The West Wing, I think its beginning to wind down. (I know, you're thinking I'm really lame, but the show is so good. Once you start watching you can't stop.) But it's made me think that I want to work in the White House or for the Senate or something political, which is good since I had no work-direction that I was thinking of before. We'll see how long this lasts... haha. Maybe I can be Tom's future Deputy Chief-of-Staff...

Needing this weekend like its my job... 4 days left!"

OhSoEnthused (11:20:59 PM): do it

so...haha. ok lets see, wednesday, thursday, friday, work work work. i really am starting to like work now though, i sort of just create multiple projects for myself and switch from project to project all day whenever i start to get bored so it soothes my ADD and makes the time pass a lot quicker. sylvia is really starting to piss me off though. i do all her work while she spends all fucking day on those damn message boards. and the woman has so little decision making ability that she can't even wipe her own ass without asking someone first. but anyways... lunch with erich everyday, and allison starts at the music library on monday so she'll be there too.

bianca and erich came over wednesday night for swimming and pool (that sounds repetitive, until you realize i mean pool like snooker or billiards) and thursday i did dinner with bianca and kev at tiger noodles and bianca came back, and anita joined us and we watched ""my favorite year"" and were pretty much hysterical. friday night was kelly's birthday celebration/london reunion so there was gathering and drinking and lots of watching of erich's fucking amazing movie about our trip. its sooo good. when i get back to school i won't make you all look at pictures, but there will be compulsory movie watching (its nine minutes). so yes, the party last night was really fun, and i have a few videos of it on my camera that are the funniest things ever. soooo good. and i did some drunk dialing to the hill hall girls (steph, kristin, amy, and liz) because i miss them like its my job. :o) 

today, sleeping and swimming and pizza and nonviolent political conversation with the extended family at dinner which was unusual and very welcome at the same time. then i went to ilanas, met sarah maloney's new boyfriend, and chilled with people for a bit. and now i'm home, and writing this, and then i'm going to bed. 

sweet sweet sleep :o)"

"event","so first, my usual life summary and then on to sylvia's shocking secret. 

monday:
work was really boring...except for discovering sylvia's secret (haha i love how i'm building this up) then, dinner with ilana graeme tom erich and kelly at sunny garden, which is not as good as tiger noodles and way to expensive. then back to kelly's house, to sit in the newly refurbished library. woodrow wilson lived in kellys house. i'm not kidding. it is the single best house ever. ok, that said, moving to tuesday, which is today.

work was not boring! i began my day by moving some super secret documents that no one, including library staff is supposed to know we have. but hey, i'll tell you. i spent all day moving toni morrisons books, screenplays, diarys, and notebooks all original in her own hand, which she stores at the library because she's on the faculty (not that she teaches the class) but which doesn't belong to us, although we're hoping she'll donate it at somepoint in the future. there were like 40 diaries, all bound with each page individually preserved in plastic. boxes and boxes of her memoranda and fan mail. even her telephone/address book, entirely preserved, which i snuck a peek into and found a poem, which was actually quite good. none of the staff is allowed to access/see this stuff, and  di wasn't supposed to look either. so basically, the only people who have seen that poem are toni morrison and me, which is pretty cool. 
then i did other fun stuff at my desk, which i lovingly refer to as the arts and crafts table, because i have stickers (barcodes and call numbers) paste and paint brushes, scissors, velcro, string, and all sorts of things i use to fix and catalogue books all day while everyone else works on computers. sometimes, if i'm doing the same thing for a long time it can get tedious, but today i did a little of evrything so it was good. i had lunch with graeme, and there was a library staff ice cream social (still getting paid) from 2-3, where they had thomas sweet ice cream (mmm... a princeton ice cream parlor) and live music by, get this, the library choir, the ""dewey decibels"" which cracks me up (first that they have a choir and then that they call it that, i love it.) 

home, i swam because it was so nice out, and then had dinner with the fam, where i refrained from fighting with them. but i fought plenty with my mom later because apparently she has issues with me driving to long island to visit steph and kristin and wants me to take the train, but i want my car there and she's being dumb and ok, lets not talk about this now.... because now we must discuss the woman, the legend

SYLVIA!

as you may recall, sylvia is the woman i work across from. anyway, she's great and we get along really well, since i don't know her well enough to comment on her wardrobe yet (haha). but she mentions the other day that she really likes figure skating, and how she got into it when she was an adult etc etc. she just likes to skate around now and then blah blah blah. so then i'm on her computer checking my e-mail when she's on her break later, and i'm like hmmm... i wonder what websites sylvia goes to, because she's always on the computer. it turns most of the time, she is doing nothing! she goes to figure skating message boards all day long. she goes to like 20 different message boards everyday, including a number solely devoted to michelle kwan! ahahahahha. all day long she is posting on all these boards, from like 5 different alias, including, my SylviaSkates and Skatephile. she is obsessed. so i burst out laughing right there in the middle of the room, and everyone's like what's up with this kid. anyways, i must find out more about sylvia. 

oh, haha, yesterday she alluded to an incident where she had far too much champagne at some sort of library function. this woman can barely get out a full sentence and can't accomplish anything without asking her supervisor like six thousand questions (i think he hates her...) so i'll have to dig up this story later.

nightnight.


oh and whats the hell with dana and sam both being in the o.c. and me being stuck in new jersey. how is this fair?"

"event","ok first order of business... let's get this out of the way:

dvlxoxo: the other night, i was wasted, and someone brought up the fact that nicholas cage has a 19 year old asian girlfriend.. and literally for the next 10 minutes i was freaking out like 'omg i need to call steph and congratulate her'

amazing. 

next. my last two days. wow. oh wow. 

so yesterday (saturday) i went to allison's senior voice recital, it was lovely. followed by a reception with some of the best catering ever. best hors d'oeuvres ever. haha. bryce hayes was there and made some extremely inappropriate comments, which cannot, for propriety's sake be shared here. after i that, i tooled around with bianca for a bit, and we got a call that peter fisher was having a party later and we should go. so, a lot of musical cars and extraneous driving later, i go back to biancas and joey is there, and the three of us drive to anitas to get her. the four of us (we've all decided we're not drinking) go to the party. 

so we get there and only peter, blair and trevor lamb, james, and genny are there yet. so we start playing asshole (the no drinking went right out the window for everyone but bianca who was driving), and then some kings, and then a hell of a lot of flip cup (by now lots of other people have shown up- emily hamlin, alyssa, jon headley, julia t, kelley, ramos, allison marshall, justin, chris peters, etc.) eventually, bianca decides she has to go home, and takes anita too. probably around 1:30, i called allison paz and she was like want me to come pick you up? and i was like sure. so she set out to come and get me. 

right, so allison comes and picks me up, and i love her for it, because i'm really tired and fairly drunk. right after i leave though shit hits the fan at the party. according to how i heard it from bianca and anita this afternoon, which is already a second hand account, but here goes: trevor (who was a senior when we were freshmen, for all you college people reading) jumps over a table and starts beating the crap out joey (again, more background, blair, his sister, and joey dated for a really long time, and their breakup ended badly). so joey's getting the crap beat out of him, and blair is cheering trev on. and genny comes up and is like stop it guys, and blair punches genny. apparently somehow jon gets punched too. anyway, in the morning peter has to call his parents who come home at 8:00 am to find a $5,000 table ruined and a passed out joey with a swollen face and a possible concussion on the floor. oh, apparently someone threw a coaster at joey's face too, and its cut. so yeah. glad i got out before all that, i feel really bad for joey. 

so back to my story, allison picks me up, and takes me back to her house, where she very quietly sneaks me up to her room and after a snack and some water we go to bed. now, there's clearly no good way to explain me to allisons parents in the morning but they're going to nyc early for brunch with family, but allison's not going, so we can just sleep through them leaving. so we get up around 10:30 and there doesn't seem to be anyone there, so allison checks and decides that her dad is definitely still around but probably went for a run, but he has to leave by 11:30 so i just have to lie low until then. we think we'll hear him come in, but, of course we don't and then, there is dr. paz knocking on allisons door like 5 seconds later, and allison and i just sitting in bed. and its awkward. but he chooses not to acknowledge the obvious fact that he has no idea how or why i'm here and just goes on about his business and allison and i go down to breakfast and the whole thing is funny and awkward.

and allison and i saw harry potter. and it was good. and i think that being away for my parents for a little longer than 24 hours might help ease our fighting a little. or at least i'm hoping.

haha ok i need to shower because i'm still really gross from last night. bye."

"event","yesterday:
lunch with natasha at tiger noodles (soooooo good). boston chinese sucks. it doesn't even compare! later dinner with natasha, jen, jan, and priya at romeos followed by some light hanging out at natasha's house. i went to bed at 9:45. i was fucking exhausted. i never go to bed that early. wtf?

anyways
today
less exciting. i measured really old nasty crumbly books all day and visited erich at the museum twice. we had lunch at georges. i missed my CTD HM SPK. mmm. it was good. tonight promises to be super boring since we have family coming over for dinner and my parents are pissed at me and won't let me go out. ahhhhh. me and the fam, not on good terms right now. lets hope for some improvement there. 

lets see, what else? i still haven't sent my postcards from london (oops...) but i did write them when i was there so they are authentic!!! if you asked for one you will be getting it sometime. at work, i work with sylvia in the ""end-processing"" of the rare books collection. we're like the last step in an assembly line for books being catalogued, repaired, donated or whatnot. we're like ""bffe aeaeaeaeaeaeae..."" as dana and steph would say when they've had a couple (or steph's had two...) haha. sylvia is probably around 38, and might be the frumpiest person i've ever met. she's chinese, with long, kind of gross black hair that she parts in the middle and is getting kind of salt and pepper grey. every day she wears a different long sleeved plaid shirt and jeans, which are too high at the waist, and too tapered at the bottom. and ugly sandals. but she's really funny, but not because she's trying to be. i love her, in that i-love-my-awkward-aunt-oh-isn't-she-cute sort of way. 

anyway, i'm going to go and make something delicious for dinner and then not share it with the rest of my family. just kidding. mmm. i want pad thai. from fusion express. enough musings for now. back later- i wouldn't want to disappoint my faithful readers (haha, i know dana's life is depending on these posts now).

"event","first day of work today! it went well- sort of interesting sort of fun but not like ""oh wow this is amazing"". i can definitely see how being in that building 5 days a week all day long could become tedious. but for now its still really cool. the only thing is i have to be careful about spending money. being right in town and getting an hour for lunch and then a half hour break is going to tempt me to spend a shitload of money on lunch and coffee. i'll have to be wary of that.

i had lunch with tom and kelly and ryan carr which was fun. i picked up my brother from after work and came home and had dinner and my whole family fought and it was spectacular. mmm, don't you love those sorts of dinners?

on a better note i jumped into the pool when i got home and swam around and it was good. all i really want though is to be back in wren 335 snuggled up watching a movie with every one in their respective places :o).

"event","so graeme called at like 8 this morning and was like ""want to go to six flags?"" which of course i did. so we went. and we rode nitro three times in a row, and batman the ride twice and medusa twice and did stuntman's freefall which is the first ride i've actually been scared on in a long time. then we went through the safari and all the giraffes surrounded my car and it was a lot of fun. there was this douche bag in a minivan and his family and the whole way through they kept opening their windows and feeding the animals doritos. for christ sake. are they trying to kill the animals? giraffes and llamas and camels and such should not be eating doritos clearly. so i pulled up next to them and graeme yelled at them. 

sadly enough, six flags' renovation of the safari last year included blocking off the baboons with an electric fence, i suppose so they couldn't fornicate on, pee on, and destroy the roof of bianca's car, like in the days of yore. it wasn't quite the same without the crazy baboons.

then, we went all the way to the shore, and drove up and down the beach to find chowdah and crabcakes because we were in the mood. and we finally found a place in avon-by-the-sea that looked appropriate, but clearly it wasn't enough of a hut/shack/hovel, because it ended up being too expensive and didn't have a good new england clam chowdah. still the hour and a half driving each way was brilliant and being at the shore was fun. 

later, i got together with jen and rob and natasha and priya and had coffee and dinner in town. rob, jen, priya and i chilled on the princeton campus for a few hours after that and played frisbee, which was fun. we went in the university chapel which is gorgeous and waded in the fountain by the woodrow wilson building. (definitely a good date spot if anyone is looking for one). 

work tomorrow. not really excited. don't know exactly how dressy i'm supposed to be, so i figure i'll start at the more dressy end and work my way down. i'm hoping that the summer help wears jeans and shorts and stuff, but it will probably be more business casual or some shit and i'll have to go buy more clothes because i don't have enough stuff in that category. and that will suck.

wow today was a long day and tomorrow i have to get up early. i hate being this tired and not being able to sleep till noon. its the worst.

next up on the reading list:

eats, shoots, & leaves by lynne truss. (a book about punctuation oddly enough...)
breakfast of champions by kurt vonnegut
the curious incident of the dog in the night-time by mark haddon (which sounds stupid, but apparently is really good. we'll see.)

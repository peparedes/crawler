ANyway this gang on 15 asians with knives and balaclavers on turned up after some guy tht was at lukes party! Anyway they had fukin knives and bats and crow bars. They threw a brick at lukes kitchen window which is like where we all were so the lads were all like trying to get all us girls upstairs in the bedroom safe. ANyway some girls lyk tried to run outta the house and my mate nicole said summot to the asians who then pulled a knife on her and told her to get out of the way. Anyway they all ended up inside lukes house whislt this guy they were after was hid in a bedroom with the girls. Anyway some girls tht had got out called the police so nxt thing i know there are dog patrols and riot vans outside lukes house! ANyway they kinda literally chucked us all out, but then i dunno how but i got lost on a road by myself wearing only a fekkin vest top and skirt so i was FREEZING anyway this gang came bk and they were coming towards me so i  bezzed it sumwhere and found this lad who looked after me. SO abt half an hour later i went bk to lukes cos i hadnt seen him and i needed to check he was ok anyway i told the police i was hus gf and i was crying so they let me in lol anyway there was only me luke and this lad the asians were after so they gave statements and eventually the police went................... so yeah great what a party tht was!"

Rite well yeah i split up with him because i hadnt said owt on here really because i dunno if i said it it wud make it seem more real i guess. Anyway for a couple of weeks things went downhill quite quick. He started ignoring me at college and stuff and we hung abt lots and he started making excuses not to see me and stuff and i dunno he just didnt at all seem interested. Anyway it was really gettin me down so i tried tlkin to him about it but lukes not much of a talker really and i kinda established that he had other stuff going on in his life and i dunno he was like well i havent got as much time as i used to. So anyway we carried on but in the end it was upsetting me too much and i wasnt happy always me making the effort with him so i decided to end it with him. ANyway yeah i was pretty cut up for a bit but im ok this week. We're still like mates and stuff so thats ok!
People have bin making me feel way better saying how a gud lukin girl like me cud do sooo much better than luke lol so its the college party on monday so i cant wait for tht now with my new single status! Already got a couple lined up LMAO omg how wrong does tht sound.......... oh well gotta play the field enjoy myself a bit b4 i get into another relationship LOL omg i sound like such a slut!
But anyway yeah im feelin better abt it all and everyone thinks we're gonna get bk together but no i dnt think we will do after all this.
So yeah cnt wait till monday now! hehehe got a kewl retro outfit! Black pleated skirt, legwarmers and a blk n white stripey jumper thing with plastic white hoop earrings and a big black thick headband lol looks pretty cool if i do say so myself!

I jst think i dunno i think brett started suddenly saying tht he loved me because maybe he didnt want me to get with luke or summot. I dunno i jst think that a relationship with luke would like last longer and stuff and thts wot i want realy. Brett just says some wierd stuff sometimes. Like last night he said ""i'll ring you later if im in a talk to katie mood"" And i mean if he likes me as much as he does why would he say tht! I dunno it jst seems wierd. And he like acts asif he only wants to see me outta college well i dnt want tht. I know how much luke likes me. My mate had a big chat with him abt it and i dunno i think we're TOTALLY different people so she was kinda asking him why he liked me so much. Cos i was saying im pretty quiet and layed back...... i dnt think i'm very glam and im not at all really confident in myself. And i jst didnt think he'd go for tht sort of person cos his personality totally contrasts that. But she was asking him abt it and he was like "" i dont care i luv her just as she is"" and stuff and i know he'll do right by me all the time and stuff so i thort yeah its got to be him.
So anyway im off to the cinema with him tonight! Which im kinda nervous abt cos i dunno i havent actually been on my own with him before! hehehe! Anyway im sure it will be ok lol!
I shall tell you how it went later lol

Still feel incredibally bad abt brett but he'll be ok i know he will! He'll soon find someone else!"

"event","Argh i havent upated and theres so much changed! Well you see thing is im not with  brett anymore! Yeah i was kinda upset at the time but when i thought abt it i kinda realised it was the right thing to do we were more like best mates than boyfriend and girlfriend. So yeah we're mates now and its cool!
ANyway on like wednesday you know luke the guy in the pic with me below! Yeah well he was on msn and i was asking him if he had his eye on anyone so i cud maybe help set him up anyway he described this girl and he said. Quite short and petitie long brown hair, always grinning for one reason or another, really trendy dress sense........... and he said tht she was in our kinda little ""gang"" at college! SO im trying to think and i really couldnt think! The grinning bit really confused me because like if anyone describes me they always say how im always smiling! and it kinda sounded a bit like me but i thort nahhh cnt be! ANyway i couldnt guess so he said look in this and you'll see and sent me a picture of a mirror!!
And i was like woaaaa totally shocked. ANyway i dint know wot to do cos he was kinda a really good mate and i dint know whether i thort of him in anyother way so i said tht i'd kinda have to think abt it but we're kinda together now everyone was saying how ace he'd treat me way better thn brett who seemed more interested in his mates and stuff. And spending more time with him really showed me tht. ANyway its hols now so he said tht he'd take me out shopping one day and then to the cinema and summot to eat and stuff so thts cool. And today in town we walked past this guy selling roses and i kinda went ""awwwwwwwwwww"" next thing i knew he'd bought me one i was like AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! and he's really sweet and looks after me so well so yeah im quite chuffed. Bretts cool with it too cos them two tlk and stuff so its all ace really! So yeah im really happy :)"

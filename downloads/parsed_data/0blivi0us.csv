"event","ok so right now livejournal needs to be alive.  even though a lot of people dont look this which is why i like it.
wow.  six months.

six months ago i was both a lot less happy and a lot less sad.  i have good good good days now.  but it also seems like every time i'm having fun i feel like i'm gonna explode.  
probably because whenever i'm with people that make me happy they also make me sad.  which is pretty much everyone i know.

like friday.  happiest and most exciting day that i've had in like 429589 years.  you have no idea.
but then it got dark and i was sitting with meredith on the bench and i forgot who i was.
not like literally like in a name sense but just who i actually am.  i just sat there thinking out loud about anything i've mentally bombarded myself with for the past 2+ years.
like you and you and you and you and maybe you.
just like i haven't listened to title and registration on purpose for longer than i can remember.
so basically i went from oh my god i'm excited to oh my god i'm total loser to oh my god i love these people.
whoops i skipped that part.
I LOVE YOU CARLY for making me a party.  that was the nicest thing anyone has done for me in a forever.
and i love everyone that was there too.  you guys seriously made my day. actually like week. maybe longer.

the beach was also really fun.
sidenote:
i really can't trust diaries anymore because i can't trust my red box and i can't trust lacey not to read them and tell janet and then i cant trust either of them not to tell everyone they know.
so basically every little thing has bottling up inside for the past 2 years.



and i really hope you guys didn't all get arrested.  because i care. 
make good choices, because if any of you die or become whatever i'm gonna have another reason to cry.



Yeah.  and now its my birthday in 3 and a half hours and i'm over my whole getting old thing.
and now i'm almost kinda happy which is good because i really hate myself when i'm like this.

don't worry, be happy.         haha singing"

"event","My weekend was absolutely Carly and Janet filled.
<br>
Yesterday Carly and I couldn't think of anything to do so finally I
went to her house and we ran. 17 minutes and 11 seconds. Crazy, at
least for me, you running weirdos (Sara). Got all sweaty and disgusting
and then met Janet at the yacht club to go sailing/jump in the water.
She couldn't find the boat, so we sat around and did basically nothing.
Super fun!
<br>
Today I went to Carly's house at eleven. We were stupid (again) and
then met Janet (again) to go to Angel Island. We sat in the sun for a
while until attempting to kayak. I wasn't very helpful. I am sorry.
We tried digging a really big hole for about 5 minutes until we gave up
and went back. Janet and Carly swam, because they're CRAZY. Ooh, but I
got pictures! Well, on Carly's camera, so technically SHE go
pictures... We left, and then Janet's mother attempted to teach us how
to drive. I was disabled. Enough said.
Went home, fell asleep, woke up. <br>

it was fun, but extremely awkward, especially in my head.
that made little sense.

i like the number 13 soooo much better.
because after you turn fourteen, you turn fifteen, and then sixteen, and then you can drive, and then you turn eighteen and go away to college and it all just moves so fast.

ah, im a loser."

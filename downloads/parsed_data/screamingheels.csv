My mum blew up and started whacking her with the cane. <b>Whacking</b>, not hitting. Then Mum told my sister that she had to find a way to find that $150 herself to pay for the tuition and started pushing<i>(dragging too.)</i> her out the door. Mum told my sister to go down and search for the money and locked her outside. WTF? She's only Primary 5 for goodness sake. Uh and so I called my mum crazy and I opened the door and let her in. <br />My mum whacked her so hard that my sis was screaming like hell and even my brother tried to search her bag in hope of finding the money. After that, my mum asked about their results. My sis got 60++ to 70++ and my mum whacked her again -.-<br />My brother failed Chinese and my mum started to whacked him.<br /><br />My parents don't cane me anymore cus they know it doesn't work for me.

Hahaha.</strong></p>But sad enough, it <strong>IS </strong>me. Another face of mine in fact, I guess.<br />As much as you've changed over&nbsp;the<strong> </strong>decade, I've changed&nbsp; just as much as I possibly did. Wierd innit? I felt as if 2 seconds ago I was just beginning to enter&nbsp;nursery<em>(I couldn't stop crying)</em>&nbsp;and I called my teacher Ah-Ma -.-<br />Just 3 seconds ago I just entered <strong>Keming</strong> Pri and getting bullied by all the freaking boys! Hair pulling.. Racing against each other in the field during recess. Mind you, I still remember the people I've mixed with in primary school ok. Also, in<strong> Unity</strong>. I socialised with more girls this time though. Was more engaged in CCA rather then in Keming though. Track &amp; field, netball, house activities. Nearly was house captain but I pushed it away so Nizza got it instead.<br /><br />And then there was this period of time where I went to China for 6 months before I couldn't take it and flew back ASAP. I'm not being racist or anything. I wasn't really able to adapt to their environment there. But I'll <strong>never ever</strong>&nbsp;forget the 2 best friends I had. They were both boys, one was a Korean and&nbsp;another was&nbsp;from HongKong. My&nbsp;total best friends. We hung out everywhere. I played gameboy and exchanged games with the Hongkong guy.&nbsp;I went over to the Korean's for dinner. <strong>It was totally fab.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />But I disappeared suddenly, so I don't think they'll ever remember me. Or my name, for a matter of fact. It's rather a pity. Sometimes these memories just churn out from nowhere at all. Damn. The condo I lived in was full of foreign people like me. <strong>Asians, Caucasians.</strong> Bloody hell there were alot of ang mohs ok. But none of the&nbsp;closer ones were of my age. Seriously, I miss playing with them :(<br /><br /><strong>Do you have any childhood friends whom you've lost contact with?<br /></strong>Btw, new class blog at <a href=""http://qetesh.pseudocide.net/"">http://qetesh.pseudocide.net/</a> :D"

Walao! Today before I even woke up I was sweating like hell already.
And by the time I woke up(12.58pm), I reeked of perspiration. 
The weather nowadays is bloody hell <i>cheesebun</i> hot. Could have died of dehydration. 
<strong>MUST DRINK MORE WATER!!</strong>

Anyway, I'm an ultra good sister :D
I custom made a layout for my sister lor that stupid idiot. 
Aiyah the making process was easy, except for the coding part.
WAH DAMMMIT, spent like, 1 hour figuring out codes. <i>(I was using a new set of codes that I've never used before.)</i>
I &hearts; the layout, nice lei!
But she's a P5 kiddo and doesn't want her blog to be publicised. LOL.

Harry Potter today on Channel 5, 8pm.
Gonna watch and complete (or at least, try to.) my homework. 
Meeting bf&hearts; tmr. Hehe byebye :)

I'm pondering whether to use WORDPRESS or LIVEJOURNAL.

Don't know how to explain.&nbsp;Look at the pictures below lor! :D<br /><br />Then suddenly, I don't know who the heck started this game. Played the guessing game, (5,10,15 and stuff) loser had to eat the icecream they mixed. And the mixture was HORRIBLE. <strong>Grape + Strawberry + Green Tea + Milk + Chocolate</strong>. You gotta look at the pictures below to really see how the mixture looks like(First two pictures). And and and the finale! They added <strong>coke + MY orange juice and ice</strong> to it. DAMN, I ate a teeny lil bit and fuck. The taste sucks. Horrible terrible. Like puke. And I forgot, they added chocolate chips, sprinkles, biscuits. OH GOD!

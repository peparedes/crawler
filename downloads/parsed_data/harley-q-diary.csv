I know it's been a while, I was on the run from the Bat again this week! So now here I am....

Anyway...self preservation vs. forgiveness? Well, this just reminds me of those discussions we had in class at the University! Those were some good days....

Personally, I feel both are important. Of course, in my position, self preservation would have to be the main thing. I cannot go out and get caught, put behind bars at Arkham again now, can I?  ;)  I have gotta make sure I can remain a free woman so my Puddin' and I can be together. Him coming to visit wouldn't be good (they would nab him pronto!) and they won't allow us to share a cell!

Forgiveness is important too though, but right now, it doesn't serve too much purpose. Maybe in the future it will...but not now.

It hasn't been the best of weeks so I am not as talkative as usual. So, in all fairness...please forgive me! (Wow, it's great how this all tied in so nicely!!)

more later,

well, someone asked me if I believe in love at first sight.

the answer is...well, what do <i> you</i> think???

I say that because, hey...look at me and my Puddin'! he stole my heart from the first moment I laid eyes on him at Arkham. I <i>tried</i> to resist his charm and sexy looks, but...my heart won out.

that is why I am who I am today!  ;)

you know, I never did believe in it before Mistah J. I thought it was a bunch of nonsense...hey, I didn't even believe that love existed!!!

now I know better, and you know what? I am happy.

this was a lot shorted than I thought it would be, but the answer is so <i>simple</i>, which may be the best type of answer!

until next time....

Hmmmm...I have been thinking about whether there are good reasons to get really, truly good and smashed. 

I say, of course there are!!!

Back when I was still at the University, I would get drunk with my buds quite a bit (and woke up in several strange places, but that is another topic now isn't it?). We did that simply because it was fun, it was the weekend, there was nothing to do....

Other reasons I guess would be out of depression, or rage, or in celebration of something. I would not recommend drinking in rage though...I have seen a lot of bad things happen there!

As for me now? Wow, I don't think I have been drunk since meeting Mistah J! A little tipsy, perhaps...but not <i>drunk</i>. I mean...if I did drink too much, then the Bat showed up...that would be a free trip back to Arkham for sure, ya know? Just what I don't need, thank you very much!!! I would either be too out of it or too hung over (the next day) to elude him...that Bat is a tricky one! Gotta watch out for that in this line of work....

Besides, I am drunk already...drunk on love for my Puddin'. 
*sighs happily*

Speaking of my Puddin'...I can hear Mistah J returning from his, um, errand...so off to see if he wants some cuddles!!

later days,
- Harley Quinn  :)"

"event","Dear Diary,

Ya know, I have been thinking all about this whole so-called ""new year's resolutions"" thing lately...what with it being a new year in two days and all. I have heard them all before: losing weight, starting an exercise program, quitting smoking, giving up a bad habit. I admit it, ol' Harls Q here's done her fair share too....

But you know what? I am over it.

Yes, that is right. No more resolutions for this gal!

What made me decide this, was thinking about all that has been going on here, and about the one I made last year. That stupid one.

The one where my gal Poison Ivy made me swear off my Mistah J, when he and I were having...well...<i>differences</i>, and I crashed out at her hideaway.

I said I could do it, I said it was for the best. Like I need a man to define me! 

But you know what? I missed him. Insanely.

And he missed me too. He even told me so, when I finally caved and called him...and he rescued me from what would have been certain capture by the Bat.

We made up, Ivy eventually spoke to me again, and all is well now!

So this, dear Diary, is why I refuse to ever make another resolution ever again. Why make some promise that will just wind up broken anyway? Life is too short, and I love my Puddin' too much!

I STILL say he doesn't define me, by the way!! I am with him because I <i>want</i> to be.

Well, that is all I can think to say on that! So until next time, as they say....

"event","Dear Diary,

it is time to answer this week's question, and here it is:

<i>Do you feel that you were born with a predetermined role in society? If so, how do you feel about it?</i> 


Well...you know, I never thought about that one before! To be honest, I must say that...I don't think that I *was* born with such a role, and if I was, that I decided to do my own thing. 

When I was still doing my first assignment at Arkham, working with the inmates (and concentrating on one in particular...we all know who  <3)  I *never* in my life expected to fall head over heels in love with my Puddin'! 

I just thought that I had to do what society (for lack of a better word) wanted me to do...which was be a good little psychologist, do what I was told, meet a ""nice boy"" and someday get married. But here I am, writing this while hiding out from the Bat....who would have thought it, you know?

Some people say that things happen for a reason, but I always believed that life was a series of random events that may or may not be a part of some ""grand plan"". I just cannot see any fun in knowing that my whole life has already been all planned out! I want some input too....

The only thing I believe there is a reason for, is love. I am who I am, because I love my Mistah J and feel he and I will have a future together someday. 

I don't know what will happen in the long run, (so long as it's not being back at Arkham again! I hate that stupid cell, all alone) but whatever *does* happen...it's not because it was predetermined, it is because it is what *I* feel is best for me and (I hope!) the Joker.

I hope this made some sort of crazy sense...have to run, it's feeding time for the babies!! (that's what I call our pet hyenas)....

toodles for now,
Harley Quinn"

well hello hello!!!

it's me, the one and only HARLEY QUINN, and this is my very first entry!!! it's been such a mad whirl since my Puddin' came into my life...he's really the bee's knees! (do bees even have knees anyway? dunno about dat! my Gramma used to say it) but I have to be quick here because I don't want him to see this...he thinks I am working on a plan to erase the Bat! and now he wants me to turn the music down. What gives there? Maybe he's afraid someone will hear us, who knows right?  


I've gotta run, my Mistah J is calling me, toodles until we meet again!  ;)

love,
Harley Babe  <3"

"event","I lucked out on the flight from Sydney to Honolulu. Three seats to myself. I just lied down the whole time with my three blankets and pillows, watching two tvs. Couldn't have asked for a better flight.

I was only in Honolulu for an hour. It was hot. The airport had wooden check-ins and counters. There weren't any doors on the front (or atleast they were hidden), the airport was just open air.

My Grandpa has always wanted to go to Hawaii. There was only one store open and I looked for some kind of souvenir hula girl to get him, but there wasn't anything. Next time Grandpa.

The flight from Honolulu to Vancouver was packed full. I saw beside two Canadian ladies and really noticed their accent (eh!). There was a lot of turbulence at the end of the flight. I've never felt sick on a flight but I did on this one.

I was completely out of it in Vancouver airport. I wanted to ask the airline if I could take the next flight, but thought I would atleast try first. I forgot my water bottle was in my backpack and security took it away, oh well.

Vancouver to Toronto was only a 3.5 hour flight. When the flight attendant announced it over the intercom, I heard a girl behind me say that must be wrong, but then he repeated it in French. I sat beside an American businessman who had an engineering degree and MBA. He explained why the Canadian dollar had reached par and gone even higher. None of the buttons worked, headsets, lights, etc. He complained and basically informed the flight attendant that he would be getting a voucher for a free drink on his return flight. I don't like people who complain to hospitality staff, be nice.

The flight arrived in Toronto 10 minutes early. I had a quarter ready in my hand to call Mom at work and let her know I'd landed, but found that local calls were now 50 cents (I guess it had to happen, a quarter was just too good).

Mom said that she was just waiting for Amy and she would be there soon. She still couldn't believe I was actually back.

I waited out the front of the airport for what seemed like ages. Mom was going to finish work at 5 and drive to the airport. There was a traffic cop walking around getting all the cars to move away from the loading zone I was waiting in. People in two cars started arguing and the traffic cop just stood there laughing. I couldn't help but laugh too.

All I could see was car headlights. I picked out ones that looked familiar, it was a blue Tercel but not the right one.

Finally, Mom pulled up. She jumped out of the car and hugged me. She looked the same, only had shorter hair. Amy looked completely different, she's all grown up and damn skinny!

After Mom drove around lost for about an hour we arrived home to their apartment. It's a two bedroom apartment, cute, perfect just for them.

I slept most of the next day. Sydney was sick though, she'd started throwing up. She was hissing at me so I stayed away. Dogs are so much better than cats.

The next day I was up early and Sydney threw up three times. Then she stood in between the bedrooms and I hissing at me so I couldn't go get Mom. I threw her a treat and she chased it. Mom got up and cleaned up the puke, but some of it was pink tinted so Mom decided to take her to the vet. Mom took the day off work and Amy only went to her first class. The vet kept Sydney in because she'd swallowed something and needed to have an operation. Mom kept saying that she didn't think she was attached to it at all, but now knew she was because she'd pay anything for Sydney to get better.

Since Sydney had to stay at the vet for atleast one night, and Mom and Amy had the day off, we decided to go and surprise Grandma and Grandpa in person. Mom hadn't told anyone other than Amy that I was flying over, we were going to surprise everyone.

We walked into Grandma and Grandpa's house but they weren't there! While Mom and I were looking through the notes that they always leave when they go out, we heard the door and it was Grandpa. He stood in the doorway for a minute when he saw me, I said Grandpa and went to hug him, he unfroze and hugged me. I missed him so much.

Grandpa freaked out and showed me all his pictures while we waited for Grandma to come home. After about half an hour she came home and when she saw me we both started crying.

After a lot of catching up I decided to start ringing the Aunts. I rang Aunt Cathy's first, spoke to Kate-lyn, after Aunt Cathy came home they decided they would come over to Grandma's. I rang all the Aunts (except the two in Nova Scotia) and surprised everyone.

Grandpa made me his specialty, macaroni and cheese his way. Mmm good, hadn't had it in three years.

Aunt Cathy and her family showed up after dinner with a chocolate cake that said 'Welcome Home Megan'. After dessert Aunt Cathy grilled me like there was no tomorrow. She asked how I had really met Corgie, and I told the truth. I'd told Mom and Amy the truth the day before. No one seemed overly impressed but said hey as long as I was happy it all worked out. I still think the story is sweet.

Grandma gave me a pair of socks with a Canadian flag on them. She said I'd have to go stay with them for a few days before I fly out in December.

We only got Sydney back last night. They took two elastics and a soft hair band out of her stomach, Amy's of course. She'll be alright though, and Mom has given her a second name of Goldie because she cost so much. Amy has since picked up her hair ties.

Corgie and I had a big talk this morning. We'll be ok.

I've only been here a few days and I'm sick already. Yay traveling.

Miss you Corgie, 33 days."

I flew from Adelaide to Sydney today. Yesterday and this morning I was freaking out, I ran out of time and the house was still a complete mess and a million things weren't done, but it'll be ok.

I started crying before we even got in the car.

I made him pinky swear everything would be ok while I was away.

The flight wasn't too bad. I tried to read but just couldn't focus on anything. I haven't seen my Mom or Amy in three years. I haven't been apart from Corgie for this long in three years.

Looking at the clouds out the airplane window will always be one of my favourite things.

I took a taxi from Sydney Airport to the hotel, Hotel Ibis World Square on Pitt Street. The taxi driver was pretty nice, and of course he'd been to Toronto, everyone in Australia has either been to Toronto or has a relative there.

Dropped off my bags and got ready to set out. Next time I'll definitely have to remember sunscreen.

Now, I had no clue where I was really, other than in the middle of Sydney. I rang Corgie before I left, he said I should go downhill and that will take me to the harbour.

So outside the hotel I went left, which was downhill. The whole area was China Town, people were everywhere.

In my usual pathetic habbit I found a McDonalds. While people were in the line up one of the staff was going around taking orders on a PDA type thing. After she took my order she gave me a yellow sticker. The store runs ridiculously fast this way.

I made a pigeon friend there.

Then I just kept walking. I had all day to get back to the hotel and I could always ask for directions if (when) I got lost, or grab a cab.

I followed the masses of tourists to the Darling Harbour area.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i107.photobucket.com/albums/m291/corgieandmuffin/Darling-Harbour.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>

There were these little trains that were weaving in between the tourists. One was blue, taking people to the Aquarium, the other was a Lindor Chocolate gold train.

I didn't go in to any of the big attractions (Chinese Botanical Gardens, Aquarium, Navy War Museum, etc) because I wanted to find the Sydney Harbour Bridge first, I thought I could always go back. I didn't get a chance but will definitely go see the Chinese Botanical Gardens and Aquarium if I ever get the chance.

I walked around Darling Harbour and just kept following the masses.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i107.photobucket.com/albums/m291/corgieandmuffin/Darling-Harbour2.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>

The monorail seemed to pass by every few minutes.

I just kept wandering and somehow lost the masses of tourists. I found signs to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and tried to follow those. My impeccable sense of direction wound me up completely lost in the industrial area where there wasn't any tourists at all, but instead a few too many old scary men.

I walked for what seemed like forever and finally finally saw the bridge up ahead, all was not lost.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i107.photobucket.com/albums/m291/corgieandmuffin/First-Glimpse-Sydney-Harbou.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>

I always thought the Sydney Harbour Bridge was just a bridge, and well it still is, it's just a big one.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i107.photobucket.com/albums/m291/corgieandmuffin/Sydney-Harbour-Bridge2.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>

The weather was perfect, there were all sizes of boats criss-crossing in the harbour.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i107.photobucket.com/albums/m291/corgieandmuffin/Boat-Thing.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>

And not to far away was the absolutely massive Sydney Opera House.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i107.photobucket.com/albums/m291/corgieandmuffin/Sydney-Opera-House2.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>

Corgie and I have to remember to get patches or stickers of Canadian and Australian flags. I was asked so many times for directions and all I could say was 'Sorry, I'm lost here too.'

I took photos of two tourists for them. I should have asked them to take one of me, oops.

A few last photos of the bridge and it was gone. You can't tell from these scaled down pictures, but there were people climbing the bridge, they looked so tiny.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i107.photobucket.com/albums/m291/corgieandmuffin/Sydney-Harbour-Bridge.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>

Eventually I found my way back to the hotel. I worked out that if I had turned right instead of left (and gone uphill instead of listening to Corgie) I would have gone straight to the main tourist area near the Opera House.

My feet are still killing me but it was worth it. I just wanted to have a look around and I did.

I leave Sydney tommorow morning for Vancouver, then straight on to Toronto.

I miss him so much already...

------

I finally got my Provisional License (equal to G2) a couple months ago. First test I did I didn't exactly give way to 2 people and the test was terminated with an immediate fail. Second test I somehow miraculously passed. The Tester said I have an observation problem, but he still signed the nice bit of paper to allow me to drive by myself on the road. I have since crashed into a bush and the fence on the way out of the driveway, but no real damage to the car or any people (yet).

I finished my traineeship. I now have a Certificate II in Business Administration. It doesn't mean much but it was free and it will always be a back-up if something goes wrong with uni.

Work has been alright. The bosses yell and everyone gossips but it pays the mortgage.

Corgie is on summer break and working at a pizza shop. Only one year left and he's finished his B.A. and then its my turn.

We're planning a trip to Canada (and hopefully a few other places around the world) in December this year. It's too early to say if it will definitely be happening but I hope so. I need to see everyone again.

"event","Now I should update with something atleast slightly significant, but I'm not going to. Instead you are going to get this:

<b><u>Megan's Guide to Proper Check-Out Etiquette</b></u>

1. Once you have finished your shopping, you will proceed to the check-out area. Before entering a check-out queue, ensure that you have collected all of the items that you came in for. It wastes other people's time when the cashier has just finished and you have just remembered something you need that is on the other side of the store.

2. Do not, I repeat, <b>DO NOT</b> stack your items on the conveyor belt. This does not help anything, please wait for the conveyor belt to move down and thus create space for your items. Stacking your items in a very carefully built pyramid can only result in a foodslide disaster.

3. The cashier will usually greet you, and possibly ask how you are, just a bit of small talk to keep things nice. Most cashiers actually don't want to talk to you, they just have to greet you because it's what their bosses tell them to do. You could talk about the weather, certain items on sale, that cute baby right next in the queue. <b>DO NOT</b> bring up topics such as your extenuous medical history or the fact that your grandmother wears depends, as topics such as these are not the type of thing that you should be talking about with your local grocery store check-out operator.

4. Watch the price of your items as they are scanned. If anything seems amiss, bring it up with the cashier, but only if you know what you are talking about. Do not argue ridiculous things that have no back-up whatsoever with yourt check-out operator, as you will always be proven wrong. Check-out operators are not perfect robots, and we do make mistakes sometimes, so watch the prices of your items.

5. Before you pay with any kind of tender, check to see how much money you are spending. You should know approximately how much you are spending, and have the funds to settle the bill. Sometimes problems may occur in this area, but it should be by mistake, you should know what you are doing with your money.

6. Do not try to arrange children and food together in the same area of the shopping cart. This is not a good idea, something will go wrong.

7. As you are leaving the store, check to see if you have all of your bags. You should be paying attention to this. Check-out operators will only chase down old people if they have left their bags at the check-out, as they usually just forget, and they don't move that fast anyways.

8. As a common courtesy, thank your check-out operator, usually while he/she is given you your change. The check-out operator has most likely been nice, and not stacked leaking meat packages on top of your fresh fruit, and so deserves to be thanked. This also keeps you in good relations with said check-out operator, and puts you on the good customer list.


Sadly, after only a month of working check-outs at Woolworths Australia, I believe these guidelines are necessary. Yes, people did talk to me about the topics in number three."

"event","Ok, so maybe I really shouldn't be trying to work two jobs. I've barely had time to sleep, and have been living on fast food. On Friday I worked an overnight at hungry jacks, day shift at woolies (training), and overnight on Saturday, I managed to get about 2 hours sleep in between the last two shifts though. This week is worse, a couple 12 hour work days and then another crazy Friday, 5-10pm at woolies, 11pm-8am at hungry jacks, 9am-2pm at woolies, I can do it, with a few cans of one of those energy drinks things. Okay so I've never had them, but I saw a couple people at hungry jacks getting them, I said I'd never had one, they asked how I got through overnights without them. Now that sounds kind of bad, but hopefully it'll just keep me awake. Only a couple more weeks of working way too much, I'll either quit Hungry Jacks or just have like 20 hours a week. 

It doesn't feel like Christmas. It's hot, and my family/friends are on the other side of the world. The decorations are up in the malls, the music is playing, but its just empty. 

It seems to be the 19th and I have yet to send any cards or presents, uh oh.

I got a little bit of Canada from Rabie last week in the mail, a can of Tim Horton's hot chocolate. *Pets the can.* Thank you Rabie. It makes me feel better, mmm Canada."

It is now December 12th.

I haven't even bought any, although I did look. I couldn't find any cool Australian Christmas cards, or anything small and Australian that I can put in generic Christmas cards.

I really really need to send everything. Oops.

Now I wouldn't be that concerned about it because people should probably expect to get something horribly late from me, it's just that I'm working full time at Hungry Jacks plus part time at Woolworth's until atleast New Year's so it will be an uphill battle just to sleep enough this month, nevermind do all of the stuff that I really want to do because Christmas cards and things are cool.

Oh yeah, we got a car. It's *my* car. It's an 88 lazer, the other one we have is an 83 lazer. Yes we are the cool car people on the block. My car runs really well apparently, it's just really ugly. It's blue but both doors have been replaced, one with a different colour blue door, the other a bright yellow door. Fortunately Corgie's daddy is the coolest, and has said that he will paint the car any colour I want (other than black, it's too hard to make it look good and it will look dirty) for just the price of paint. And by the way, in Australia, if you leave a black car out in the sun things will start melting in it. My car is cool, I like it. Plus it was only $700 and we can make it look nice for like nothing. I wanted to paint it purple but Corgie will have to drive it once in a while and he thinks it will make him look a bit too ""gay."" So we're probably going to get it painted either white (because it won't be as melty in the summer) or light blue (because its already blue and its a non-gay colour according to Corgie.)"

I either don't have, or have lost, all of your postal addresses.

You see, I never really used an address book. I had a notebook that happened to have a decent amount of addresses in it a long time ago, but that has since become outdated and lost.

I did have most of your addresses, but they were usually written on tiny peices of paper dispersed throughout the house and either eaten by dogs or lost. Sometimes though I had the thought to actually save your address in a simple random wordpad file on the computer, but of course we have to format the computer at random and I seem to have a great dislike for making back-up files.

Anyways, please post your address in a comment. I am going to buy a brand new pretty address book this week, and this time I am not going to lose your address, probably.

And then let's pretend this post didn't happen. Mostly because it's not cool knowing what happens after someone asks for your address."

Now this would have been okay if I had slept decently sometime yesterday, but I didn't. Turned out that the interview was a group interview, ending in a written test. That was exactly what I wanted when I was having trouble keeping my eyes open. When it came my turn to talk all I could think of was *Don't fall asleep. Don't throw-up. Don't threaten to kill them all. Say something damn it.* Well I fucked it all up completely. Atleast I don't really care because they casually mention half way through the interview that you're only guarenteed 10 hours a week and that there was still another interview process after this. It's a fucking supermarket, you don't need a 3-interview selection process for check-out cashiers damn it. First they woke me up at 11am (after a night shift) with a phone interview, then there was today with a group interview, and anyone who is successful then gets an interview with the store manager. Fuck that, fuck them, fuck everything. I'm going to bed."

"event","Dear Prime Minister John Howard,

Have you looked outside lately? Have you even once in the past two terms of your unnecessary four terms stopped listening to those cute little pixie voices in your head?

Now I don't mean to be rude, because I'm sure you get enough of us ""Australian workers"" trying to talk to you about one of the most controversial bills that has ever been brought before parliament in modern Australia. But really, what the hell do you think you're doing?

You are intentionally creating a bottom class of society. Hey, what does it mean to be rich of you don't have the poor to compare yourself too right? You are lowering the quality of life for those who are already struggling. You are muscling this sugar-coated stomach bile bill of yours through the two houses which you have someone managed to both gain a majority in. See that I definitely don't expect you to tell the truth all the time, that's almost un-human, and I would never expect that from a politician especially, what would the public do with the truth?

You are making Australia into the only first world country that does not allow collective bargaining in the workplace. You are taking any power that the Australian worker has away and claiming that you are improving the system.

You are not improving the system.

Was it that everyone else was in a union but you? Did you feel lonely and decide that no one can be in a union if you can't? I apologize again but, what is your annual salary? What a nice cufflinks Prime Minister John Howard, I'm sure many children below the poverty line could have had breakfast this  morning but you do look snappy in those cufflinks.

It is quite tricky of you to tell the public that you are doing something good for them, improving the workplace relations system, improving everyones lives, improving the economy. I know I could never do that, I'd say that it would just weigh too much on my conscience to be taking away such things like award wages, penalty rates, and collective bargaining.

Oops, I said the words collective bargaining, I didn't mean it, really I didn't, I'm sorry I just don't have the money to pay that <b>$33 000</b> fine for trying to come to equal grounds with an employer.

I'll make you a deal, because generally I'm a nice person and I'll give you a second chance, oh sorry you blew that one over ten years ago. But anyways, I'm a nice person, so how about if you can make it, nevermind live comfortably, working as an un-skilled young Australian worker, I'll let you pass those laws of yours. Won't do it? Understandable of course, you could never come down off your perch at the top to notice anything like mass protest and public outcry for basic work rights.

Finally, if you haven't caught my point yet, no one likes your new workplace reforms. And we the public really feel that it is time to stop spending tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars on full page newspaper advertisements and television commercials attempting to defend this pathetic ""simple <b>700 page</b>"" bill. 

You made it to the position of Prime Minister of Australia, congratulations sir, but why do you feel the need to take any kind of oppertunity from Australia's next generation? You lived in an economy with fair wages and work rights, now it's only reasonable for you to pass on the same to Australia's future.



Sincerely,

Megan Pennington"

But hey, I'll give in, everyone is entitled to their own taste in music right?

It's just, have you watched any real musicians play live? You know, musicians, people who write their own songs, who know what they're songs mean, people who have a story to tell. There's this radio station that I really didn't like at all when I first moved here called Triple J, Corgie listens to it. After a while I've realized that they actually play good music, not the headliner bands all the time, not the music that all the other radio stations play all the time. They play real music, all different kinds, they give a chance to the unheard of bands who might never have a chance of getting their music out there. Some very famous acts have had their start at Triple J, and their the ones who deserve it. All you need to do is just watch them play their music and actually listen and you'll see.

It's most likely that anyone who will actually read this knows what I'm talking about.


----------


After reading over my last post I will admit that I did make a few negative comments about Australia. Just to even the score I thought I would point out a couple of things that I really enjoy about Australia.

The weather. Now I know that Canada can't help being freezing but it's just so nice here. Even in the winter you might only need a sweater most of the time and it doesn't rain too often. It just improves life a little everyday when its just always nice outside.

The ocean. It's only a 15 minute walk, and I could stay there all day. There's a pier only a short drive away where you can walk out far enough into the ocean that if you watch the water closely somedays you can see sharks. I'm still a bit too scared of the water and I have yet to stay out there long enough to look for the sharks. But it just makes you feel so small, it always forces you to think of the bigger picture, not quite the effect you get from the foam of Lake Ontario.

So Canada can't really help not being able to compete with Australia for those two things, but I have more. I have no idea what the Canadian system is like, but I really like the promotion of green energy and recycling here. There's government incentives for buying green energy products such as solar panels right down to water-saving shower heads. You can drive down the street and Corgie guessed it's about 1 in 5 houses have solar panels, usually for hot water I think. The new airport terminal is covered in solar panels and can even generate energy instead of using tons of dirty energy. There's recycling programs like green bags (to reduce the number of plastic bags used) and paid bottle recycling. It just seems that for once the people who actually have the power to change what humans are doing to the environment are actually doing something. Also I know it wouldn't make that big of a difference but there seem to be more second hand shops around here, including clothing, appliances, etc. Oh how I love op shops.

Another thing, which I may have bitched about yesterday, is government payments. If you do get in to trouble financially, lose your job, unplanned pregnancy, etc. there is a pretty good support system there to help you. Adelaide (population 1 million) isn't quite as big as Toronto (population 4.5 million) but i see very few homeless people on the streets compared to Toronto. So maybe you can argue that the people who are on the streets haven't taken advantage of the programs offered to help them, but isn't it possible that there's a better way here where people don't sink far enough to stay on the streets? Or maybe I don't know what I'm talking about at all, either way.

The higher minimum wages here are good as well. Although things do generally cost more, it is actually possible to live on minimum wage. It would be possible to live on minimum wage in Canada but you would possibly be living in a basement apartment and you might be scraping by. The wage system is currently a little complicated but an adult age 21 and over will make atleast $12 (usually more) per hour. Combined with government payments I believe it is actually possible to have a family where only one parent works for minimum wage (although you would have to be cheap). Now I know that the minimum wage has risen in Canada since I left, which is totally great, but just because it gives me a better example I'll use the Canadian adult minimum wage when I left which was $7.15 (after just going up.) You'd be lucky to make $250 a week, how can you pay for basic living needs plus keep your family comfortable on that. I imagine that some people did it, and they are now luckily a bit better off since the rate has gone up in Canada.

The Australian spirit, is one thing that I will have great difficulty trying to describe. There's a more relaxed atmostphere in general. It may be because of the many pubs around but I like to think not. You've probably heard of that Aussie saying ""no worries mate"" which I absolutely love and yet for some reason I can never make myself say. Sports play a big part in it, footy is huge here, a game only played in Australia. Okay there's some weird form of it played in Ireland but that's only one other country. There's also fair dinkum, where customers are encouraged to buy Australian products because too much money is going to overseas companies. And oh yeah, at the footy games someone in the crowd will yell out ""Aussie Aussie Aussie"" and the rest of the crowd responds ""oi oi oi."" That most likely sounds like something little and stupid but it's lots of things like that that just give you the aussie feeling.

That's all I can think of for now. There's probably huge things that Corgie would remind of when he comes home that I talk about a lot (I compare countries a bit too much.) I'm probably just talking a load of shit and it's all completely unfounded but hey it's my god damned LJ."

"event","The birth rate is very low in Australia, and to encourage breeding the government gives out a once off payment of $3000 when you have a baby. This will rise to $4000 in July 2006, and $5000 in July 2008. As a result, people are having babies, which is okay by me, it's just that now the rate of teenage pregnancies has absolutely skyrocketed. I was talking to this guy at the op shop who told me about one of his female friends who dropped out of school, wasn't working, and was just hoping to get pregnant because of the baby payment plus other child payments. Oh yeah and you get a one time $900 payment too when you have a baby, I think most people get that, but definitely everyone gets the big payment. Oh yeah that's not including the child payments every week, which do go down if you make over a certain amount per year.

Anyways, there's pregnant women (girls?) everywhere. The op shop guy told me that there's a suburb of government housing that is just teenage moms living off the goverment. Now, I'm all for kids, they're cool, but I always thought that you should prepare yourself financially (plus of course emotionaly, physically) before you have kids. With this wonderful government program people seem to be having kids just ""willy nilly"" and it's just... weird.

Like yes a teenage girl who gets pregnant accidentally should have all the support she needs, but the people who are leaving school, not using protection, having kids for the money, etc. just drive me mad. This new system just seems to be creating more of the lower class worker, who doesn't go to post secondary education and possibly drops out of high school. That is good for the already wealthy people, for wealth is relative, and if you don't have your poor working class to compare to then what makes you rich?

The guy at the op shop (he talks a lot) told me about his friend who works at a pub. Now comparing Australia to Canada it's just absolutely ridiculous the number of pubs. Okay so I never went into a bar/pub/thingy (see, I don't even know if a bar and a pub are the same thing) in Canada but atleast I know that there wasn't a pub around every corner. Now in Canada I know there's slots at racing courses, and certain major gambling centres. Slots are called pokies here, and there are up to 50 (or more?) in each pub. Yes there are a few that advertise ""pokie free"" but there are very few of these. Not only are there these pokies in the pubs, but there's a place called Tab that is just a business where you can place bets on anything all day. There's just this huge gambling culture everywhere, and I've heard stories of people just wasting their life savings (and other peoples too) at the pokies. Yes, gambling is an addiction, but should there be 50 pokies in every pub, and a Tab around the corner? A decent amount of the revenue from gambling does go to the government, so the government doesn't discourage gambling at all, and hey where are they going to get all the money from to pay people to have babies. Back to the guy at the op shop with a friend who works at a pub. Once a month or so the government agency who gives out all government payments (called Centrelink) pays everyone, this includes unemployment payments, child payments, etc. Now apparently on these ""pay days"" the pubs are absolutely packed full of people who line up for the pokies, and any other gambling games available at pubs.

I guess it's just that I can't understand why people do certain things. Yes there is a payout, but what are the chances you are going to win? So you play the lottery often and buy as many tickets as you can, but so do many other people. I hate gambling, I hate the lottery, giving false hope to the poor and the not so bright (hey, you have a one in how many million of winning that huge lottery?) just isn't my thing. This year I bought a $2 scratchie lottery ticket at a deli while I waited for my lunch, and I am quite content with that.

I seem to have gone from baby making to gambling, but yeah, people spend their money that they get from making these babies on gambling. I'm really not sure how many people do it, but just seeing the evidence like pokie advertising signs everywhere, and hearing from many people what has been happening, drives me crazy.

There's one more thing that I must ramble about. I know there is unemployment benefit for people who lose their jobs in Canada. I never actually looked it up and read about it and how it works, but what I like to think is that this is used as a back-up system for someone who loses their job and can't get one right away, also for people who are unable to work for whatever reason. Now of course there are unemployment benefits in Australia, this payment is called newstart. It's great that we live in a country where there is support for people in trouble, the only problem is the abuse of this system around here is far too common. Glen's aunt and uncle have been living on newstart for so so long, they raised there kids while living at home on newstart and therefore their kids never learnt responsibility of supporting yourself and others. The guy from the op shop (isn't he wonderful) is currently receiving newstart as well as his wife, while raising three young children. It's great to be able to stay home to look after your children, but wouldn't it be better for everyone if you would just get a fucking job? It would also be nice if you would set a good example for your children. Maybe I'm under the complete wrong impression, maybe people who can work should be living off the government and stay at home, it just doesn't seem right.

Enough of that crap, ""Shut up Megan,"" ""Okay.""

Today was my second training shift at Hungry Jacks (Burger King.) I almost forgot how anal fast food people are. I was hoping I'd get manager pretty fast but I just can't be that evil and pushy. Atleast I'm not retarded and I can already can take orders and do everything pretty well, with crap training.

It's hard to believe now that I used to work up to 14 hours a day, up to 65 hours a week, plus going to night school and everything. Since I couldn't work due to visa issues for quite a while I'm just so used to not doing anything. Oh well, I'll get over it, I'll get the paper in the morning and try to get a second job, since I doubt I'll be getting the hours that I want from Hungry Jacks. Hopefully it'll be close, because it just takes way too long to get to Hungry Jacks via the wonderful public transit system.

Corgie, Ralph, and Death are all good. We're living in our blue heaven, not sure what the future will bring but atleast we know that no matter what we can deal with it."

"event","I got my visa on Tuesday, a lot earlier than I had expected. I immediately searched for a job, first interview was at Hungry Jacks (Burger King, renamed Hungry Jacks in Australia because when they came here the name Burger King was already copyrighted and being used), and I was hired on the spot for full time. Ok so yes working full time at a burger king sounds like the worst job but I wanted to get a job fast, I'll look for better ones while I work there. Plus if I do stay there I can make manager really quick because I'm cool, indeed.

Turns out that I will be considered an international student for the visa I'm on for the next two years. There's no way I can pay internation student course fees, starting from $10 000 per year. So I have to wait 2 years to start university, it sucks but its not that bad after I talked to Corgie for a while. The 2 years gives us time to set ourselves up financially (since we'll both be working full time). We'll be able to refinance our home loan and pay it off really fast. We figured out that we can own this place in 7 years (even with me only working part time while at uni), then move into another home and rent out this one.

Instead of having one general minimum wage for under 18 and a slightly higher minimum wage for 18+ (like I assume they still have in Canada) there are wonderful things called award rates here. Ok they're really not wonderful at all but still. They have ridiculous charts like this http://www.safework.sa.gov.au/uploaded_files/cafes_r_07_05.pdf where basically there's an adult rate of $14.30 per hour if you're a cashier person, you get that if you are 21 or over. But if you're under 21 you get paid only a percentage of the adult rate, 20 year olds get 90% of that pay, and lucky me at 18 years old gets paid 70% of the award rate, coming out to $10 per hour. I don't know why they have this system but there's probably some good reasons for it. It just kind of sucks that I'm 18 and only making 70% of the award rate when I'm not living at home and trying to pay bills and such.

Even with me having a crap ass (yes, crap ass) job, we can still get stuff before we start paying off our mortgage. Our current list is:

Fridge - frost free, used (our current one is really old and generally breaking down)
Front loading washing mashing (again ours is really old, breaking down, and if we get a front loading washing machine we can stack them in the laundry)
Eliptical/treadmill (ok, we eat too much pizza and mcdonalds)
Wood chips for landscaping (we'll probably never actually do the gardening work necessary for this)
Curtains (so we can stop putting on shows for the neighbours)

Yes, that is all very exciting. You are indeed excited about me buying a frost free fridge."

"event","I am currently very frustrated with certain departments within both the Australian and Canadian governments. They suck, hard.

On the other hand, after the many many years of being toyed with by immigration, I'll be able to go to university rather than TAFE (Australia's version of college) because its only $3 900 a year for tuition. We'll have to pay for books and other fees, but still, I win.

I'm going insane from not doing anything. I don't have work or school rights so all I can do is volunteer, and I have to wait for my bridging visa and then ask the immigration department permission before I even do that. I hate to say it, but borrowing money for me to fly back to Canada to work until I get my visa with work and school rights sounds like the best idea. It's just that I can't leave Corgie for that long.

It was 2 years yesterday since we met in Toronto for the first time. Now I'm living in Australia with him, and we're married. Funny how life works out."

In and out of the streets all day flying high at night, i'm the uncatchable untouchable right-side-in me. and yet after all this time you follow me still? chase me to a city i'll stay here a week, afterall i have been flying for hours. trap me in this building i think not, but it does feel cozy i'll stay here a night. force me into one room you haven't caught me, i am uncatchable untouchable ride-side-in me. but maybe, just maybe, i'll stay here a while, just for a bit in this nice little room. i tire of this, i'll just hide in here for now. take an afternoon nap in this corner right here i'm just a little tired of this non-stop game. i wake up and your gone dear sir, i told you you couldn't catch me. but i'll stay in this room in my corner right here, it's nice and it's warm and it's raining out there. where have you gone oh i do miss our games, inside-out right-side-in upside-down games. and sometimes i wonder while i sit in my corner were you right all along, was inside-out the real right-side-in and was i wrong the whole time? put up the bars invisible bars and lock me in this cage with out-side in locks, put the barbed wire up extra spikes this time. i was wrong all along i should have been inside-out which was right-side-in but how was i to know. how could i have wasted all this time being outside in that awful weather running away from the real right-side-in. So here i stay i'll be right-side-in, you haven't caught me, uncatchable untouchable right-side-in me, but maybe, just maybe, i just don't want to run anymore from you mr. unstoppable invisible right-side-in."

I really wanted to put ""Thanks for bothering to come to our wedding, now please leave us alone"" in all of the family thank you notes, Barb wouldn't really let me though.

"event","The night before the wedding I stayed over at Glen's parents house, they're Barb and Garth. Rachel and Georgia came over and we watched Shark Tale and ate lots of candy. We all did our nails, mine were black. I went to bed early because I just wanted the next day to come already.

I woke up at 7:30am, the earliest I've woken up for months. I couldn't go back to sleep, I knew if I got up then it would just take forever until I could start getting ready. I got up, watched tv for a while. Barb and I made 5 loaves of sandwhiches for the wedding. Finally Garth went to get the cake and the flowers, they looked really nice. I thought Rachel was going to be coming around 10, but she didn't show up until 1:45pm, and Georgia and I were supposed to start getting ready at 2. I walked around a table for atleast half an hour freaking out because *I'm getting marrrrriieeedddd.* Finally it was time to get ready, I got into my dress. I put on the skirt underneath that had the trail on it that Rachel made for me. I was supposed to wear these black gloves but it was too hot for them at the time. I put on my choker with the purple cross that Glen gave me, and my black ballet-ish shoes. Georgia got ready while I was, she looked really cute in her pink dress that Rachel made and the ribbons in her hair. Barb suggested we sit down and have some wine so we could all relax before we had to leave, so we did, I had one glass. Barb left early to go set up for the wedding and Rachel said we should have another glass so we did. I did my hair in about 5 seconds while we were sitting down having wine just with clips. Then it was about 10 minutes before we had to leave so I went to do my make-up, only problem was that the ground seemed to be moving, I was drunk. I never ever drink anymore so 2 glasses of wine got me drunk, and I still had to do my wedding make-up. I really don't know how I did it, I just think that I took a lot longer than I usually would when doing my make-up. Somehow that magically turned out and it was time to go, Garth was driving us to the ceremony, he took pictures of us before we left. Got in the car, we had to have my wings in the back seat with us, so Rachel and I had to hold them the entire time so they wouldn't bend out of shape before the wedding. We had white ribbon on the front of the car, oh yeah the bridal car is a Siddely, an old pimpin kind of car. Lots of people waved and some cars honked at us on the way. The drive took around an hour, amazingly I somehow sobored up halfway through the drive, I really didn't want to stumble up the aisle.

Just as we were driving in the gates of the park (we had to drive to the middle of the park to the actual Old Government House) Barb called to say that everything was ready, they had to set up a lot of stuff and didn't have a lot of time to do it. We drove to the middle of the park, and I started freaking out completely, I couldn't control it at all. We drove up through the gates of the Old Government House, almost running over Hissey (Glen's friend) who just realized that the wedding was starting. We stopped the car far enough away so that Georgia and I could get out and get ready, I had to get my fairy wings on. We got out and all of the guests were staring at us, they were maybe 20 metres away but I didn't want them seeing my yet but there was nothing we could do. Rachel helped me get my wings on and we told Georgia to start walking that way. Georgia didn't want to go, she was scared, she wanted me to walk right with her. After a bit we got her to walk on her own, and then I wasn't sure when to go so Rachel told me to walk already. As I walked down the path I was shaking so much, totally nervous and freaking out. I found out later that Georgia had basically marched really quickly and thrown the flowers way up into the air, even though the entire way we told her to walk slow and throw the flowers like this, but it was very cute. I walked up the aisle and found Glen, he looked like he was freaking out too. I stood on the left side and gave Georgia my flowers and Sylvan (our celebrant) started the ceremony. I could hardly pay attention to anything that he was saying. I just kept thing ""Ok, don't run away"" and ""Yay Glen showed up."" For a while a bee was bugging Georgia and she was dancing around kind of, and then she spilled the rest of her flower petals. Finally we got to the vows, where Glen repeated after Sylvan and then I did, I almost cried, I managed to hold myself together. Then came the exchange of rings, Glen gave me mine, and then as I gave him his it wouldn't go on (his ring is a bit tight) and I started laughing. That was one of the things I was scared of, starting to laugh during the ceremony and not being able to stop. So I laughed through the ring exchanged but managed to calm down after a bit. Then Sylvan announced us as husband and wife (yay!) and we kissed (yay!). We went to do the signing, where the girl is supposed to sit down on the chair and the husband stands behind her for photos, I couldn't sit down with my huge fairy wings. We both signed it, I was so nervous I just scribbled something that resembled my name. Rachel came over to sign as the witness, and we had to get Sam's attention (the other witness) who seemed to have forgotten that he was a witness. After the signing was finished Sylvan presented us as husband and wife, for some reason Georgia decided that she needed to stand right there in front of us and be presented too. We walked back down the aisle together and the pictures began. Jeanette (Glen's aunt) took the role of director and told everyone what to do, without her it would have taken so much longer and the pictures probably wouldn't have worked as good. After a million pictures, half of them with a bunch of strangers that I didn't know, we went to the patio where tables had been set up with the cake and drinks and everything. We cut the cake (ooooooooh!) and I may have eaten some icing off the edge, and everyone kind of saw, lol. Garth gave a speech, he talked a lot about me. He told the story of Corgie and I, well it wasn't exactly right but close enough, it was sweet. Then Corgie said thank you for coming and thank you for the gifts to everyone and that was that, time for cake and food. We walked around for a bit, neither of us are really good at mingling, we talked to a couple people and had some cake. Took more pictures and had some wine. We decided to run away a bit early, not sure what time we actually left at, but everyone waved good-bye and there were of course more pictures taken until we finally got all our stuff into our little yellow car and drove off. Someone had written in the dirt on the back of our car ""Just Married"" (yes, our car needs to be washed.) And off we were to our wonderful honeymoon."

Everything is coming together a little bit more everyday.

I'm so happy.

Edit: Nevermind Nish, the internet has given me your address, I know you wanted it to your uni but your uni is icky for unexplainable reasons"

"event","We're probably going to send the invitations out sometime next week. I told my Mom last Thursday, she barely said anything other than I'm too young and she was just shocked. This is the first e-mail she's sent me since then:

----------

how are you doing.  your news last week shocked me a little.  i hope you are going to think about it for a long while.  i think it might be best if you came back for awhile to sort things out here.  it doesnt have to be right away but dont you think you have unresolved issues here as well.  if it is truly meant to be and real love it will still be there for you.  would be nice to be able to meet Glen and know something about him.  you know how my family is - pretty close with issues like these.  ive only told grandma and aunt cathy and they feel the same way...  think about it for awhile and let me know,,  maybe Glen and you could save money and come over here together for awhile.  Im not against the engagement, i just want to know more about everything thats been going on.  i didnt even mention it to your dad today other than to say you might not even come back.

----------

In other words, think about it, realize you're too young and wait, let us approve him and then marry him if you still think that you need to do something stupid.








Fuck this family shit, I left them for this for a reason, FUCK YOU! I'm going back to bed..."

"event","We had dinner at Corgie's parents last night, we talked about the wedding all night. The guest list has now reached about 40, with everyone. I'll explain everything later but basically we're having a small party at the ceremony venue afterwards and if we invite everyone to our wedding and that Corgie's mom is going to help us out with paying for the wedding. It's big now, and it's only 1 month and 3 weeks away. EEEEK!

I'm going shopping now with Corgie's mom, sister, and a couple other people. I have a whole page of notes about everything. I'll post everything up here to try and organize it in my head when I get back.

Hehe, hehehehehehe... yay :)"

"event","Tonight we went to Corgie's parents house and told them the good news. They were happy for us, then Rachel (his sister) came over after we called her to tell her and we all had a toast and it was cool. We talked about the wedding and everything and everyone was happy. We found out that Corgie's mom is having an operation at the hospital on April 14th, so our date of April 17th wouldn't really accomodate her. After a lot of talking we've now changed it to April 10th, and hopefully it'll stay there. Well ok this is all assuming that the Old Governor's House is available, the celebrant is available, and everything. But yeah, this date is earlier and that makes me happier. I can't wait, everything is so exciting. I'll call the Old Governor's House tommorow to see if we can change the date. Yay, yay yay yay yay yay yay eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

"event","You know how I said we had to change the date to accomodate age issues? I may have been wrong, lol. Our celebrant called this morning, he called up a contact in the registrar office and I can be 17 when I sign the intended marriage form, the celebrant didn't know that. Yay we don't have to move the date, April 17th 2005 it is."

"event","On Valentine's Day, Corgie officially asked me to marry him. He wrote me the sweetest poem, we were on the beach as the sun was setting, and he put a ring on my finger. It's all real now. It's wonderful.

Also on Valentine's Day, my boss from the pizza shop called and said that he was closing down the shop, it wasn't making any money, hence, I am out of a job.

Today, we went to see a celebrant about the wedding. It turns out that if I'm 17 I can't sign the form called the notice of intended marriage, which you lodge with the government one month and a day before the ceremony. So, it turns out we'll be pushing back the date, probably to May 8th, the first Sunday after the day when it's a month and a day after we sign the notice of intended marriage, which has to be lodged a month and a day before the marriage, but when I'm 18, if that makes any sense to you.

The ups and downs of life, and yet it all seems overshadowed by not having a job. I've always been able to get a job no problem, but here... everything's different. I know we'll be ok, we both know that, but... will everything be okay, will I be ok, how long is this going to be, fix it, please?

"event","After 3 costume shops and much frustration as to sizing, we've found my (<i>wedding</i>) dress. It's a dark purple medieval dress, with really cool huge sleeves that go down to the ground. I love the sleeves, they make the dress. It's got a little bit of silver detailing around the coller, and criss-cross ribbon on the front which makes it look cool. I'm going to wear these black gloves with it, the kind where there's a loop to go over your middle finger so they have that... look, whatever kind it is. The lady also suggested that I wear a celtic type of cross on a black ribbon around my neck, she had a couple but they were all really tacky. I'm going to take the purple cross that Corgie gave me when I first got here and put it on a black ribbon and wear that, it looks good and it means something to us. I gave up on the white dress, deep down my girly self did want a white dress but my size just does not look good in a white dress lol. This one is perfect, the only thing I'm worried about is that I really wanted fairy wings and with this dress I don't think they'll fit, because of the huge sleeves. I think I'll make them and then see if they do or not. I was going to make them pink (that see-through shiny type of material, organza stuff, Emily help?) so hopefully they'll somehow fit with the outfit. 

With everything put together we don't have a theme at all. The setting is a garden in a <b>victorian</b> house, I'm wearing a <b>medieval</b> dress, we're playing <b>modern</b> music, and Corgie is attempting to find something to wear that will somehow fit in. The closest thing so far is a big black gothy cape with a hood, although he can't wear the hood, I won't let him, I want to see his face and not be scared lol. Anyways, we have a victorian medieval modern wedding so far, it's mismatch, just like the socks we wear everyday. 

I think I'll wear black fishnets under the dress, it comes down to maybe my ankles so I doubt anyone will see them, and I'll be like ""hehe I'm wearing fishnets on my wedding day, take that you normal fuckers."" The only thing left is shoes, and now I have no idea (again, Emily you shoe freak, help?) I guess it would make sense to wear black shoes, and I don't want heels, so....? Flat black shoes? There we go, that's solved. Ok not solved, since I'm going shopping with Zoei tommorow and she'll know the names of every slightly different type of shoe and make me try on a million to find the perfect one, I just want flat black shoes. Where are my flat black shoes? Lol, but tommorow will be fun. I love the dress, really, I just hope everything fits together ok. 

We have a meeting with the celebrant on Tuesday, a ""non-obligational consultation."" Hopefully we'll like him, afterall I have heard good things about him (not from real people, real people suck, I like the internet) and he is decently cheap compared to all the other celebrants I harassed through e-mail.

We finally got the Old Governor's House info in the mail, that's the place we're booking for the ceremony. All the info is really good, nothing negative. Ok one thing negative, no rose petals are allowed to be thrown in the garden, which was my original plan. Georgia was going to be our flower girl and have a basket of rose petals, but I don't think she will be anymore because it's just not a big enough wedding to have her there. Ok I don't know what I mean, maybe we'll have Georgia, we'll see. Anyways, good things are: guests don't have to pay to get into the park (we thought they might have to pay $6.50 a car), a signing table and small vase of flowers is provided, also 6 chairs are provided and extra chairs are only 50 cents each, and the best thing if we want a red carpet it's only $10 (renting a red carpet can go from $60-80!) So we're getting extra chairs for everyone to sit down during the ceremony, even though its only going to be like 15 minutes maybe. I haven't been to any garden ceremonies, ok I haven't been to any wedding ceremonies since I was like 6 and I don't remember. Corgie says people are supposed to stand in the garden, is that right? I want the chairs because I was thinking afterwards we could just hang out in the garden for a bit and have some champagne or something and do some toasts before Corgie and I take off on our (yay) <i>honeymoon</I> (eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!)

Mmm, Valentines Day. A horrible day every other year of my life, but this year I haven't been able to wait. We have a reservation at Carmine's, and then we're going to go walking on the beach as the sun sets. Sound perfect enough? *giggles like a little girl* It will be, just because he's there.

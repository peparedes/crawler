                mayb if i tell u 
                the feelings  that are real
                perspeactives will be said
                and theyll  learn how to deal

              
               i dont think u get it yet
               or the consequences that i face
               this means so much to me 
               every heart beat is a race

            
               so what happens now?
               now that it got so close
               from me  not being ur evyrthing
               and not being the most

           
              give me more ideas
              ill make up some more lies
              ill come see u wen no one noes
              just dont let my eyes cry

          
             ill do what ti takes
             ill take it to the top
             i will never stop trying
             so pleace dont ever stop

        
             lets do what we can
             and give it one more try 
             lets leave the drama to them
             and not think of us as a telling lie

"event","dear anthony,
              im sorry that you went away so soon. it seems like just yeasterday we were together just playing games. i really miss you. i no you miss us all too and i no ur watching me from heaven cuz your my one and only garding angel. eveyr time i think of you i cant help but to get tears in my eyes. i miss you so much. and youll always be in my heart and apart of me. today i went to your grave not just because its the aniversery of your death but because i love you ! youll always be my brother and my little twin. 


Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show 
          I laced the track, you locked the flow 
          So far from hangin' on the block for dough 
          Notorious they got to know that 
          Life ain't always what it seem to be 
          Words can't express what you mean to me 
          Even though you're gone we still a team 
          Thru your family I'll fulfill your dreams 
          In the future can't wait to see if you'll 
          Open up the gates for me 
          Reminisce sometime the night they took my friend 
          Try to black it out, but it plays again 
          When it's real feelings hard to conceal 
          Can't imagine all the pain I feel 
          Give anything to hear half your breath 
          I know you still livin' your life after death 

         

          Every step I take 
          Every move I make 
          Every single day 
          Everytime I pray 
          I'll be missing you 

          Thinking of the day 
          When you went away 
          What a life to take 
          What a bond to break 
          I'll be missing you 



          It's kinda hard wit you not around 
          Know you in Heaven smilin' down 
          Watching us while we pray for you 
          Everyday we pray for you 
          Till the day we meet again 
          In my heart is where I keep you friend 
          Memories give me the strength I need to proceed 
          Strength I need to believe 
          My thoughts, Big, I just can't define 
          Wish I could turn back the hands of time 
          Us and the six shop for new clothes and kicks 
          You and me takin' flics 
          Makin' hits, stages they receive you on 
          Still can't believe you're gone 
          Give anything to hear half your breath 
          I know you still livin' your life after death 

          On that morning 
          When this life is over 
          I know, I'll see your face 

          Every night I pray 
          Every step I take 
          Every move I make 
          Every single day 
          Every night I pray 
          Every step I take 
          Every move I make 
          Every single day 
          Every night I pray 
          Every step I take 
          Every move I make 
          Every single day 
          Every night I pray 
          Every step I take 
          Every move I make 
          Every single day 

          

          Every night I pray 
          Every step I take 
          Every move I make

"event","suicide was the 3rd highest death causer for young teens. over 1 thousand teenageers 15-19 have died from suicide.
            
its kind of scary to no that thats like 1 out of evebyr 10 teens a year die form suicide. that could mean that one of us could die that way. mayb form depression.


34 percent of young women become pregnent ATLEAST once befor 20 years old.
4 in 10 girls 13 and 14 years old say that for there first time it was un wanted sex.

             thats kinnd of weird to jusr think that b/c i no ppl who've lost there virginity that age and they mtie not even want it. so many the laer u wait the bteer or atleast be sure about what ur doing.who sad is that that almost half the igrls that lose there virginty wen they first become reens dont really want to have it? 


             1 million teens say that they drunck once a week this year              39 percent had at least one serious problem related to drinking in the past year
        
.77 percent had at least one serious problem related to underage drinking in the past year


                thats really bad ... mayb drincking really isnt good i mean over half of teens that dricnk have sum kind of problem. and to think of what problems i cud have at this point.. it kind of scares me .....

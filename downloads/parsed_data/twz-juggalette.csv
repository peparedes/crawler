Then he told her to give him a massage so she did for about 5 minutes and she stopped and then he decided to tell her ""you better keep doin that, its for your own good"" so she said FUCK THAT and pused him away from her.So she still wouldnt keep&nbsp;going so he decides to pinch her leg and twist it so hard that right now she has a FAT ASS bruise from it.&nbsp;then he got all pissy and sat like 10 feet away from her. And i had my knife wit me so i started to walk tords him with it and Brandon grabs me and holds me back. I had my knife so that it was between my index and middle fingers so if i hit him it would stab him. So this shyt goes on and off for an hour or two...him talkin shyt and me tryin to get to him, poor bandon was gettin tired and couldnt hold me back anymore. So at this point it's about 10:30 (pm) and kat is standin 2 feet from him&nbsp; and me and brandon are about 10 feet from them. They were talkin&nbsp; (kinda) and i heard him call her a whore and brandon tryes to take me inside the casino so i will stop trippin. and we go to walkin the doors and i hear him call her a CUNT so i turn around and start walkin twords him hella fast and Brandon grabs me and only about a foot away from him.(when i saw ""him"" i mena Zane)&nbsp;And there are cops everywhere patrolling and shyt i didnt even care so im leanin twords him while brandon is holdin me back by my arms and i scream at the top of my lungs ""a cunt? fuck you, you dont call her shyt, i will fuckin kill you,"" and so he tries to stand up so i scream ""sit the fuck down"" and by this point everyone in the parking lot (including the pigs) is jus wathicn me yella at this mutha fucker and i really dont know why i stopped screamin but i did and brandon pulled me into the corner to try and calm me down wile Zane and kat are talkin and so are me and brandon. and then all of a sudden Kat go pissed and was yellin at him and tellin him that hes a fuckin dick and shyt like that and then she looked at me wit that ""you better get over here b4 i kill this motha fucker"" look-you know that look...and so i convinced brandon to let me go stand over there by her and they are talkin shyt to eachother for half hour or so and im just standin there givin him dirty looks and makin sure that if i needed to i could get away from him. So kat looked at me and in front of Zane i asked her ""kat please lemme kill him"" and he looked at me like i was krazie (even though i knda am) and so she told me maybe and i told her ""aint nobody holin you back....you could do it"" and he looked at me and laughed and said ""she wont hit me...i got bass knuckels i'd lay her ass out"" so i lunger to the point where i was in face face screamin ""id like to see you fuckin try, youd lay here out huh, your just a fuckkin pussy, id like to see you fuckin try, youd be gone sooooo fuckin fast, i will fuckin kill you"" i was screamin all this and more for about a minute and a half tryin SO hard to get away from brandon so i could get to him.Brandon was tryin to pull me back and i kept lunging twords zane, at one point brandon had me on the ground LOL... so finally he got up and left so we went back inside (we were ALL heated)&nbsp; so we go outside to have a cigarette and he decides to walk past us so i take off running after him and DUN DUN DUN... brandon caught me and i was screamin to zane to come back, then he called me a stpid fuckin cunt so i told him to come and talk shyt to my face and come back so we could finish that so we was about 100 yards away and kat decides to take off after him and he aparently took off b4 we got to his car and we walked the parking lot of the casino for about 15 minutes and go back inside. We just went inside and got some pizza and talked about how crazie that was (by now its 11:45) and Brandon was supposed to bring us home at 12 so we go and jump in the car and he brough us home and my parnets went home so me and my love were sittin on the bench in front of my house and kat went adn changed and came out and showed us the bruise that Zane left on her leg. It was crazie...iight well im out...BTW anybody oin vegas wanna help fight this lil fag E-mail me at </STRONG></FONT><A href=""mailto:TWZjuggalette702@aol.com""><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4><STRONG>TWZjuggalette702@aol.com</STRONG></FONT></A><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4><STRONG>...</STRONG></FONT></P>"

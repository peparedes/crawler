"event","This is my away message right now: ""<a href=""http://www.networkforgood.org/topics/international/earthquake/tsunami122604.aspx?source=AOL&cmpgn=CRS"">Do what you fucking can</a>. We have SO damn much in our lives, and we take it all for granted. 
(<a href=""http://aolsvc.news.aol.com/news/article.adp?id=20041225210109990003"">this</a> is what happened, if you don't know.)""

I hope that every single person on my list sees my away message, because it's so fucking true. There are over 117,000 people dead in Asia, and the survivors don't even have clean water to drink. Not just that, but all the bodies and sickness is quite possibly going to cause a sweep of diseases that could kill more than the quake and tsunami. I can't believe this, and I know for a fact that most of my friends don't even know it happened.

See, at my high school, kids are SO priveledged and given basically everything that it's sick. All of our sports teams have ""warm-ups"" as well as matching uniforms-- different ones for the three different teams(freshmen, JV, Varsity) and by the way, new ones every 2 years for every sport-- matching shoes/sneakers, and even matching SOCKS, for god's sake. My school is rich. And most of the people who go to my school are rich. Ok, my family and plenty of them are far from ""rich"" but I have a beautiful house, my own room, a great education, thousands saved up for my future, and thousands saved for college. I am SO fucking privledged, and there are other people in the world suffering because they can't find anything to eat. How fucking DARE I complain that we don't have the chips I like? Why do I deserve to have almost everything when so many scrounge for anything? its not fair.

I just hope that having that away message up will open someone's eyes to how they take their lives for granted, because i guarantee every single friend of mine has done so once in their life. and if one person, ONE helps because of the stupid away message, then it will be worth it. My mom and I are calling in, today, to see what we can do.

*sigh* - <3, I'm off to do some work with a friend. Have a good day, all. And remember not to take what you have for granted. Go hug your mom and/or dad, sister or brother, aunt or uncle, friend... dog. Tell them that you love them and are SO glad that you have them."

"event","Ok I did a pretty huge friends cut. (<s>17</s> 18 journals) 

This is not out of spite, this is not to make you feel bad, it is simply because things in my life are getting more serious, and I'm not too sure who I'd like to share it with. I removed some old/deleted/not used journals, but I also deleted some that were active. It's not that I don't like you, we're simply not close. You may have been on my list for a while, and I on yours, but <b>neither</b> of us made any effort to get to know eachother well, so the time came for you to go. Some, our personalities clash. Some, I would just skim by your entries on my page because I don't have time to read them- and that's not fair to you.

So I apologize if you were taken off & don't want to be. It would be nice to still keep in touch, so please email me at lcaitlin@gmail.com anytime you want. :)

<3"

"event","I hate doing this.

I hate doing it more than anything on LJ, but I had to. I had to do it for me. Please understand that I have ALWAYS hated friends cuts, because I always thought, ""it's just a list"" and that it was stupid to shut people out of your life by taking them off a friends list.

But sometimes in order to be able to pay attention to the people you care for most, you do have to shorten your friends page. Yeah, I could use my custom friends groups, but how is that fair to those whose journals I don't find time to read? It's not, and I feel horrible for it.

I am so sorry if I removed you when you didn't want to be. My reasons for removing people varied from them never updating their journal, to them irritating me, to my inability to simply trust them. Sometimes things happen where you just can't convince yourself to trust a certain person again. A darling friend of mine knows EXACTLY what I mean. <3

If you were removed, please, please don't feel offended. I feel nothing over you, no power or anything. I'm not proud that I can take you off my list, it just needed to be done. And just because I'm removing you, doesn't mean that I don't want to talk to you. It has nothing to do with that, I just really need this time for me."

If you love me. x) [Or if you don't and tell me so.]

Please post your honest opinion of me, and post it anonymously. I'll maybe try to guess who you are, but no one is forcing you to tell me. ><; So, please please do this. <3 :) Thanks."

"event","There are so many different events that run through my mind right now for our first meeting. from the hotel bar, to the front doorstep. So many different situations, all running through my mind at once. Did I wear the right thing?, will He like me? will I be appealing to Him? will I be on time? will He be appealing to me? so many questions, no answers.


how can you see into my eyes like open dooors.
leading you down into my core, where i've become so numb. 

save me from the nothing Ive become. 

now that I know what Ive become, you cant just leave me here, bring me to life. 
wake me up inside, save me, wake me up"

"event","well, so much has happened.....cat got put into quaranteen, cause she bit me and I told the truth....long story, not gonna get into that right now.

I was at the airport today.....kinda nice place. watching all the people coming and going. waiting to pick up people. dropping people off. boyfriends waiting on girlfriends to return home, big happy embraces, smiles. 
thinking, man, must be nice to have someone like that. that embraces you that way when you return home. 

so much going on, cant get it all down in a coherent manner."

"event","Today I learned that I am most like a Ruby, a Griffen, a mermaid. I am living the movie scream, and am most like the angel of peace. 
The one about the griffen really hit it on the nose. 

My mythologial creature is a unicorn! I love that! It says that I am unique, kind helpful and always on hand to help a freind. I have a captivating beauty which makes me unforgettable. And a quality that makes me utterly special! 

and of course, my greek god is Aphrodite! (sould you expect anything less?)  

i am most like the alcoholic beverage Beer. Simple. 

and, shock and amazement to all......
I am most like the Deadly Sin of (drum roll, please......)  
LUST
(wow figure that one out......ha ha ha ha)

well, im off to clip the dog now....see y'all later!
hugs and kisses

"event","I am so tired right now. it has been a very draining day. too much thinking going on in my little head. Drains my energy reserves. 
So here is what is going on, I have recently begun to explore my sexuality, and that has lead me to 3 very different men. Man 1 is a great person, appears very loving, and kind, and generous. Man 2 is a seriously strict Dom, almost to the point of being a control nut. (at least that is my opinion) Man 3 is also a strict Dom, but, he is not as strict as man 2. He is interested in more of the mental side of it all. 
so, I met with man 2 this morning. I was actually scared. scared of what he would do to me if I tried to resist him. So he did what he wanted, through me tears. I felt used. I did not like that. He has been telling me that I am not just a ""toy"" to him, but the way that he used me today, erased everything that he said in the past. I will not have contact with him again."

"event","I'm starting to look at this whole Live Journal as a bad thing. At first I thought it would be a good way for all of us to keep in touch when we leave, but now all I think of it as is a a breeding ground for distrust and sadness. It is a gossip center. Some of you may post what happened to you to day or plans to do stuff later on, but the true reason anyone looks at this is to find out what people think about, be it  about themselves or about other people. 

The whole top ten thing, although you may be finally telling someone what you wanted to for so long, you're also telling everyone else. If you truly wanted someone to know how you felt, go to them face to face. I made the mistake of not doing that before, it turned bad, but luckily it worked out. If you can't tell them face to face, maybe its better that they don't know then, for if it was truly something important and loving, then what should you be afraid of. What this really is to me, is saying goodbye.

I believe the same thing that Matt does. Don't look at this summer as our last and as if this is goodbye. There is no goodbye in our world, only cya later. Somehow, someway we will keep in touch, or see each other again. Don't look into the future being scared. Look at it as an adventure. Don't cling to the past either, embrace it for what it has taught you and remember it fondly as you travel down the road. Clinging to the old will just leave you alone later on when the world has open its doors for you to start truly living. This is just the beginning of our lives, who knows what is really out there.

I don't mean to say that I won't miss you all, I will, but I have faith in our friendships and that we will always stay together.

This will be the last journal entry I ever make.

For any of those who wish to keep in touch with me, email me your Phone Numbers, Address, Screen name, and College you are attending at Genjackel@gmail.com

I love you all and I'll cya later. 

The door is open, my pockets are full of memories, and I'm stepping through to the unknown..."

Also Matt scared the crap out of sarah woker and rachel gartner by hiding in the dark mannequin room and jumping out as they walked by. Sarah just kind of yelped but rachel did a death scream and I though someone had just died in my house, it was hilarious. Good times good time for all!"

"event","So yeah, got into a maybe little accident today.

We were going down cherrigton to whitecastle and corwyn was in front of me, they started throwing combos at my car, so i put it into reverse, rolled back about a foot, saw the light had turned green switched to drive, felt a bump, heard a screech then i drove away. I thought the bump had been my car kicking back from the sudden switch to drive, but maybe not as there was someone behind me. The person behind me flagged me down, and we pulled into subway. Her car had some yellow scratch marks on it (my cars not yellow) and this being my first ""accident"" i gave her my info but didnt take any of hers. 

I told my parents and they were okay/little angry at this, more of for the fact that it was us farting around that cause the trouble... but we stopped by the police to file something to say that if the claimed that it was a hit and run that it actually wasnt. But for now i'm staying at home for the night and Im bored out of my mind.... have fun all you guys who are out there, ill be here.. alone..."

This way well all get to hang one last time as a big group. But I don't think well do it at my house seeing as my lack of ac made everyone sweat until they died. Any suggestions tell David or me so we can all do this sometime. Itll be awesome!

"event","So it was a lot of work pulling trash during the M&A fest, but it was completly worth it because of the golf carts. After the fest ended and we had put everything away all the adults left and justin, david, mike and I just rallied through the barn and in teh fields behind it in the carts. Mike actually drove up behind david and i jumped into the back of their cart right before a huge turn. David looked back as mike pressed on the brakes and he thought i had fallen out, turns out i scared both him and justin by appearing behind them. All in all it was fun, specially how we almost flipped the cart and old people kept yelling at us to slow down. 

um.. i get really tired of people trying to hide something from me (which i already knew about) and then trying to talk to other people about it while im in the room. they are not very smooth with the whole thing and i finally shut them up about it. 

anyways i need to take action in my events and stop being a tool.
and im dead tired and my room is a messs so im going to sleep then get up and clean before helping my mom take down the final pieces of the fest.

peace out

I find things out that dont make much sense to me, such as it doesnt sound like something someone would do. but I trust the person telling me which makes everything go flippy crazyness. hmm changes my views on people, even though i still like them. confusion! wheeee!

Anyways. the past two nights have been cool as people have hung out at my house as we watched movies/talked/threw the bee. Its been full of laughing. Laura is cool! and her and I both have to deal with the squeeky squeeky and the locked doors and the radio playing, whats that now, exactly.

In case I'm not blunt enough, I'm sorry and I want my friend back.

And for everyone who doesnt know, <i>EVERYONE</i> is invited to matts at 12:30 to go up and see the parade, followed by cookout/swimming at his house, the fireworks at 10, and then watching ID4 at kathleens.

"event","Today me and corwyn got up.. after both sleeping in past what we said we would, and headed off to Origins, the gaming convention thing. We got to be nerds, but still we were cooler nerds then everyone else there so it was fun. I ran through a crowd yelling LEEEEROOOOOOY JEEEEENKINSAPPAGISDHAGFIO!!!! which made people stare but made some laugh who knew what I was talking about. All in all it was good, plus I got to hang out with corwyn which I don't do enough. But I spent over $100 dollars..which was probably bad cause i need money.

I've been really tired lately and not wanting to do much, i need to get up and do something with my summer. I should start biking again. I used to a lot, and now that the Tour started again I'm in the spirit to start it back up. I should also do my PT exercises... these are all things that I say I should do but I probably wont.

Lately Ive been brooding over something and it's just been making me Angry. My friend who I thought I knew, seems to be changing all too much too fast. They seem like the same person on the outside and when I'm around them, but Ive been finding things out that have been making me angry. And its probably because they shouldnt have changed this fast. So either they lied to me before or something happened to make me loose respect for them.  I dunno...just ranting I guess.

Ill listen to heavy rock to make me feel better.

see all of you who are going to brads tomorrow, then some others who go to matts before the fireworks on mon, then whoever else ends up seeing Fantastic 4 with us on tues (yay corwyn for scoring preview tickets)

once again its past 4 and im still awake, its probably all this stupid games fault.. can someone call me on sunday at * in the morning until i wake up so i can try and fix myself. Sleep is good when you sleep at the right times, but i dont enjoy sleeping till 3 in the afternoon.

bah

so i think someone got shot right by my house. I came home from steak n shake at 1 and the police had blocked off part of main street. I saw some cops walking around in the center with a bunch of caution tape. When i got out of my car my neighbors were outside and they said they thought they had heard a gunshot around midnight. the was a police copter in the sky with its search light on. kinda awkward. 

plus matt almost died again when corwyn, chels, and he pissed off a bunch of drunk guys heading home, whom then followed them. 

i enjoy how im too lazy to capitalize things...

never let me stay up past 2 again!

But I think the worst part for me is that I <i>wasn't</i> there. There was nothing i could have done to help, there was nothing I could have done period. I could have come back home and lost one of my closest, if not the closest of my friends....

If you don't know what or who I'm talking about, don't ask for I'm not the one to retell the story.

But before I heard the news, it was a good day. I mean it was afterwords too, just not nearly as much. 

We left NC at 8:45 this morning. Brad, Michael, and I drove for about 5 hours before stopping at a little restaurant called Hot Weiners. The restaurant seats about 8 people and was packed. We ordered hot dogs and went outside to eat. The owner came out, told us he was sorry it was so packed and to make it up, gave me a free t-shirt. Then we hit the road again, stopping only for gas, food, and classic coke in a bottle. We listened to cheesy 90's music, cartoon theme songs, and of course, incubus. we got home a little before 8:30, stopped into see my parents, then left to celebrate daivds birthday. 

Thats where I heard the story.

After that, the rest of the crew showed up including David and we headed to steak n Shake. We had all chipped in and bought David and iPod Shuffle, which I think he liked. After that we hung out around Brad's house, then Justin, Chelsea, and I drove around for  a bit and talked before heading home. 

After a 12 hour drive, I'm wide awake and no where close to getting to sleep. Guess I'll watch tv/do the laundry/write thank you cards for grad party.

"event","So today started off with us getting up around 9 and heading out to the ocean. The waves were nice and strong and we did a lot of body surfing. Although, one of the waves was strong, followed by an even stronger second wave. I rode the first, smashed by the second, flipped underwater backwards, smashed my head into the ground head and then flipped again to have my shoulder scrape along the bottom giving me some cuts. It was sweet.

As the day progressed we ended up digging a large hole in the sand and playing hold the hole. The object is to get a ball and the person holding the ball in the circle, with the ball touching the bottom. No rules after that. It was full of lots of tackling and flipping. I sprained my toe in around the 3rd point of the second game, but went on to win anyways. It was sweet too.

We ended up heading to a seafood restaurant for dinner. they were famous for crap, but I wanted more then that so I ordered a seafood platter. It was wussy, small portions of small food. Luckily I was able to mooch off my friends and get some tasty crab legs... mmm meat. 

What can I say but injuries make things much more fun.

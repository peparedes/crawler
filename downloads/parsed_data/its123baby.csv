"event","The last couple months I've went crazy with spending lots of money to see if material possesions will make me happy. I can tell you as of right now I am ecstatic, but will it last?

Here's an arrival I got today, and best of all it was free:

<img src=http://www.oddproject.com/christian/FreeiPodBitches.jpg>

Received this today as well. I got it because I'm really enjoying keyboard at school and feel I can better get into it than guitar:

Here's my new best friend. Need gamer buddies for Halo 2 and such.

I felt I've been held back the last few years because the only chance I get to practice drums is once a week at band practice and at the occasional show. This will be life changing. I played the other night at 2AM and it was beautiful.

I feel content with these sudden purchases, but when will I start to take these items for granted and when will the newness effect fade away?

Most importantly, I'm currently on tour with Folly, Antarrabae and Dreams of Reality, all extremely awesome guys. This is by far the best tour yet. It's been a constant party full of good times.

School keeps hovering over my head and I wish I wasn't going this semester. I just hope to pass all my classes so I get my degree and be done with it."

I walked on top of a car and  proceded to walk down and don't remember a damn thing after that. With the car being wet, I slipped slamming my face quite hard into the street. Blood filled my mouth and nose, I couldn't see out of my left eye and my jaw seemed to be reconstructed. The left side of my face went numb and this morning I still can't feel my lips. This was 10 minutes before 2005, so I spent the beginning for the year in a near concusion on the futon, bleeding and barely able to stay conscious.

Since I'm a dumbass and fucked up my face badly, I decided to stay home until my face is back to normal. Thanks to everyone that took care of me and other than that, the night was great. Needless to say there was no New Years kiss for me. A new party rule for me:  Stay at ground level

"event","It was time for dreaded Georgia. It has been 2 years of skillful avoidance since I have been there, but in a moment of inattentiveness, I was on the plane to see the family once again.

The first part of the trip took place with my dad, step-mom and my little brother Colby. My bro is 3 and a half now and two words for him: spoiled brat. I know it's probably just his age, but if he doesn't change the next time I see him, dammit I will lay the Escobar Wrath on him. He uses my dad and step-mom like a tool to get everything his way and they don't have the heart to say no to him. But he's my bro and he's the closest person in blood that I'll have in my life, so I appreciate him and his selfish ways for now.

Next stop, my aunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins. On one side of my family there's jocks and the other side there's stoners. Most of this time I spent the oldest of my cousins, Bobby. I grew up with him and his younger brothers, Jason and Nick. A while back when I lived in Georgia, and damn have things changed. Everyone is growing up and joining the Georgia ways. Potheads. They were so hilarious rolling blunts, joints, toking up at least 5 times a day.  Everyone I met seemed to exhibit a lack of motivation. This is how I now perceive the majority of Georgians: weed and video games.

Did I mention I was without Internet for the whole trip? Ya, that was definitely a damper.

Arriving home and stepping off the final flight into the Long Beach baggage claim area, I saw two men around age 60 or so kiss each other. It wasn't a hello kiss, it was a tilt your head passionate kiss. I smiled and thought to myself, ""Ahh, I'm home.""

"event","What the fuck state do I live in? Oh ya, California, where it snows.

Last night we had a show in Barstow and I played on a cement floor without a carpet and my set was sliding like a fish on lube. Besides it being one of my worst performances ever because my kit went sideways on one bass drum hit, it was a fun show because afterwards we all got piss drunk.

I had invited Tera to this show and we end up leaving the show around 1, so we figured we'd be home around 3. Boy, if we only knew what was in store.

About 30 minutes into our drive it started snowing. In California. Snowing in California and hard. The cops eventually closed the freeways off and we had to go to a gas station where about 40 other cars joined in a big cluster fuck to wait out the snow. About 4 hours later, Tera and I decided to try to get back on the freeway and take our chances. Eventually I got to about 20 miles away from home and I heard *thump thump thump* I got a flat tire. It was unbearably cold, but I had to run about half a mile to see where the fuck I was and luckily Tera had Triple A.

Needless to say, Tera and I weren't going to make our 7:30AM meeting for Best Buy, so I called my boss to tell him what was up. He didn't believe me and he said he needed documentation. After Triple A was done, I asked for a copy of the form and he told me they don't give copies.

We get home around 8 and I had to write an essays for my 9AM English class. I wrote that and when I got to class turns out the essay wasn't due. I was forced to write a 2-page in class essay about a poem which I couldn't understand.

My mission last night was to find out how many levels of drunk there are. I came up with 6 levels before I passed out.  There was a party down the street that I went to and the highlight of this party was chilling in the living room and hearing porno moans throughout the house of a girl being very satisfied and apparently wanting to let the whole block know. After they were done, the guy came out with the biggest grin on his face, man was he happy. I woke up at 7:45 with the worst fucking hangover of my life. I got up and drove home and wanted to cram in an hour of sleep before my 9AM English class.

I went to bed and woke up at 9:30 and was like fuck. I have a midterm today. I'm going to fail this class. My life is over. So I stumbled out of bed with still a throbbing headache, put on my lovely pink shirt, brushed my teeth and was out (Yes, I went without pants). I got to class 45 minutes into the midterm and my time was cut down to an hour to write a 3-page essay. Luckily that went alright I think...

I'm still behind in everything in my life. If I keep this up I'll be late for my funeral.

Saw Every Time I Die and The Dillinger Escape Plan @ The El Ray last night. Dillinger was headlining, but ETID totally owned the show. They must have sold more merch than all the other bands combined. A lot of people looked confused when Dillinger went on because their music is so advanced. I like how ETID slows down their music live, it's like increasing the duration of an orgasm.

<i><b>Random Thought:</b></i>
So I believe in heaven and all that, but a question has been lingering in my mind lately. If we die right now in our life, do we go to heaven with the experiences and the knowledge that we have collected thus far in life? If so, what about babies that die at birth or mentally slow people, aren't they at a disadvantage? Or perhaps say if we go to heaven as a spirit where everyone is equal. How would we be linked to our soul and our sense of self that we have had here on earth? If there's no connection of our earthly spirits to our heavenly spirits, then what's the consquence of going to heaven or hell?"

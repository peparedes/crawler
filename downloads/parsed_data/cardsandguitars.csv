"event","Got in a solid 11 and a half hours today at the Bell. Work was hella busy as it has become. The new Crunchwrap thing draws in a ton of customers. It is amazing how many things can be made with the same ingredients at Taco Bell, all they do is reposition them on different types of flour. As Chirs mocked, the crunchwrap can be ate on the go so everyone shits a brick when they find out they can eat and walk at the same time. No one ever thought of that before! Wake up, you can eat anything while walking plus do you people honestly not have enough time to sit down and eat a fucking taco? Come on.

Anyways, with all the business and nonstop customers through the drive-thru, the day goes somewhat fast and before you know it, it is 7 o'clock. Well, not really, but I like to think it that way. On the plus side, some hot chick came through the drive-thru today and I think she went to high school with me, but I couldn't recall who she was. I probably didn't like her so I immediately forgot her along with the many other classmates from the class of '03. Maybe she didn't, but anyway you slice it, she was wicked hot, which is always a pick-me-up at work. One gets sick of seeing the grotesquely obese and disgusting people that come into the store. 

I am currently owning PokerRoom.com right now, winning online is so much easier than in person and the level of talent is abysmal. But on the downside, playing against horrible players makes it very irritating, they can't be bluffed and they call you down with nothing and outdraw you too many times. I just had my flush on the flop outdrawn by runner-runner full house - ridiculous. Sometimes I think if I had enough money, or a bankroll of some sort I could make money and maybe a living playing poker online, but you have to have enough cash to get through some bad beats and keep playing. Usually whenever this thought comes to me I get outdrawn and say forget about it. But hey, as the cliche' and saying goes ""that's poker.""

Getting tired, as per usual on here, think I am going to call it a night, got to get up at 6:15 tomorrow. Oh the joys of working."

These blogs are such a novelty and I get sick of them very quickly. But, I figured I might as well write some anyways because I enjoy reading others so much - I guess I should return the favor.  I don't know what it is that makes these so interesting to read, even if they are by people you don't know. 

Summer has been chugging along quite smoothly thus far, I have been working at the Bell and playing lots of cards. Work isn't too bad away from working monster hours when I planned on relaxing this summer. Oh well, I need money. 

In a weird way I like working. IF I didn't have to get up before 7 to go to work it would be a lot better, but getting out of the house and earning cold hard cash is a good feeling. I don't like most of my co-workers and I'd say 90 percent of the customers fill me with rage. You don't realize how stupid people are until you work in fast food. Dealing with the local hick co-workers and blindly retarded customers arguing with me over what is in certain items, because they are obviously in a position to debate what comes in  a 7-layer burrito when I have (unfortunately) worked at Taco Bell over 6 years on and off. 

WEBN plays way too much Nickelback and Godsmack, these bands continue to get exponentially worse as the years go by, I wish the channel would just play old rock like it used to. I now only really listen to WTUE and Loveline and 97.3. Adam Carolla is a vastly underrated comedian and I think is a better ranter than Dennis Miller. 

I am starting to see why I stopped writing on this thing, because the topics never change and are utterly useless. 

I am destroying this bag of Chewy Spree and feel I need to stop writing.

"event","It feels great to be done with working at Taco Bell.  These last couple days of my break are going to be spent doing absolutely nothing.  I like working and earning money, but it definitely is awesome to sit around and do nothing but watch The Simpsons season 5 DVD.  
Christmas was filled with good times.  On X-mas eve, Dad, Maria and I sat up and played cards to midnight, then we opened up the gifts Tony sent us.  Maria got some kind of purse Bettie obviously picked out, Dad got a replica Matchbox type model car of his GTO and I got a little set of poker chips, cards, and other poker related items.  
Then on the morn' of Christmas we opened the rest of the gifts (we don't travel on X-mas, usually eve or the day after in this case due to the terrible road conditions). My folks were appeared pleased with what I got them and I was very happy with the haul I got.  I didn't expect to get a set of nice, professional weight, poker chips, because I didn't ask for them, but my dad picked up a WTP set of 300 clay chips (11.5 grams of course). I also got a book I've been wanting, a Family Guy and Tool t-shirt, and a tie. We busted out the chips and played cards for about 3 or 4 hours that night.
The day after X-mas we visited my grandparents and had a good time.  We ate Lasagna Maria made a few days before.  My dad and I set up the DVD player we got for his folks and we played some cards after dinner.
The past week Dad, Maria and I have been getting some use out of the new chips.  Every night we play poker for a few hours and have a good time. My dad talks about all the games he played back in the army and when he lived in the Everglades.  My dad's a great story-teller and a top-notch poker player. 
I hope to play poker at Jerry's tomorrow with Jeff and the crew one last time before I go back to school and Thursday I'm going to Jeff's little get together. 
Well, I think I am going to watch another episode of The Simpsons then hit the hay."

"event","Been putting in some serious hours at the Bell lately.  Yesterday I had around 12 hours and today I literally worked an open-to-close.  Due to the snow strom, business was way down and the roads were pretty terrible.  Jim got the okay from his boss to close the store at 7 even though it should have closed much earlier.  It was an easy yet long day, we never were really busy and we had an all right staff.  I again for the second week have close to 25 hours in two days, amazing.  
I can't stand this cold weather, I hate everything about it.  Having snow fall on me all day through the drive-thru and then braving the wintry cold to clean and shovel the sidewalks at work and when I take the trash out.  Oh well, tomorrow is my last day until I go back to work next summer.  It'll be good to get a couple more checks though, I will need the money for books and other expenses back at OU.
I am kind of excited for Christmas this year.  The holidays are a lot better when you have a family larger than one person to celebrate them with.  Too bad Tony couldn't come up this year to join, Dad, Maria and me - I just hope he doesn't have to go back to Iraq.  I think six months was enough.
Well, I am exhausted and don't feel like doing anything but sitting around so I will lounge around and listen to Love line, then hit the bed to get up at 6:45 again.  I can't wait till I am back at school and can sleep in to 8:30 or so everyday, no matter what. I love sleeping.

"event","I hate cold weather so much. 
So, the last couple of weeks have been pretty busy.  I've been putting in around 50 hours a week at Taco Bell.  I need the money to pay for my college bills and expenses.  I payed a loan payment today for 200 bucks and said goodbye to my first paycheck (of one work week) at the same time.  
Along with work, I have been managing to play a lot of poker too.  Jeff invited me to play at Jerry's and have been going there every weekend.  It's good to play against new people and help improve my game.  I do pretty well against them and have a fun time as well.  
I had to say farewell to my dog, Bowser, December 4th.  He had a tumor in his stomach area for a while before I returned home from college on winter break.  He hung in there for a bit, but got really bad around my birthday.  My dad and I decided it was time to take him to the vet and get it over with.  Holding my dog as he died was probably the saddest thing I have gone through and then digging the hole to bury him in was a bit tough too.  He was a good dog.  
In other news, the Ohio basketball team isn't doing too terrible so far, a good sign for me.  I picked up one of the positions for covering them for The Post.  So far they are 4-2, undefeated at home, and have quality wins over Butler (who beat Miami) and Duquesne, however, on the other side, we have lost to two horrible teams on the road (American and St. Fran of PA.).  Let's hope they can win some league games and go somewhere in the MAC tourney. 
Today, Chris and I went over to Travis' to jam for the first time in about 4 months. We had a lot of new stuff to work on and had a good first half of practice, but we hit a wall and then decided to fiddle around with some covers and old originals.  It was good to play some music.
Well, I am getting tired of typing and want to relax tonight before going back to work Monday.  
Good night."

I have been back home for about 20 days and I begin working full-time again tomorrow (my birthday). I was called in yesterday and got a good 8 hours in, and relaxed today a bit. 
Got my grades today, and they go as so. IART 117 - A, Graphics of Communication - A, Info Gathering - A, and SOC 220 - B.  I am pleased with my grades, and I have something like a 3.889 gpa.
Not much else to talk about, I will explain the situation with my dog sometime later and right now, I am going to watch the women's basketball game of OSU visiting OU on Fox Sports Net. Yeah, it's women's b-ball, but it's not everyday I see my school on TV.

"event","Okay, so now that I have all you loyal readers demanding an update, I've got one for you.  It isn't the fact that I am really busy - I am - but I think it is because I am too lazy to write on here.  I write 2 to 3 articles a week for The Post, so I just don't feel like using my mind anymore than I have to.  Instead, I just watch baseball and poker on television.  Plus last week was midterms and I actually studied a bit.  For anyone who cares the results are: IART-101%,SOC-93%,Graphics-85%.  I am happy with the scores, I didn't study as much as I should have for the graphics test, but I'm not too worried about it.
So what has really been happening in my life?  Not much, when I am not writing or working on the damm info gathering project (aka- the biggest waste of time since I've attended OU) I usually hang out in Gam, which is short for Gamerstfelder, the dorm in which a lot of my friends live.  A lot of wacky antics unfold there just check out Jeff and Jason's website:   http://www.geocities.com/gamertsfelder2004/home.html 
Here's a great reason to be attending OU.  Mike Reiss, you guessed it, the producer for The Simpsons, is coming here Wednesday.  Yes, I have my ticket.  I can't wait, this is the best speaker to come here since Max Weinberg.  
I'd write more, but I am more interested in watching the Astros vs. Braves game.

"event","What a shit-tastic day.  Busy and yet oh so boring at the same time.  Luckily all I have is a lab tomorrow and the critique for The Post.
Speaking of The Post, I spent a total of about six hours there today.  I got there around two and finished up my article and what not, then I had to come back in for late night sports designing at 6:30 and stayed there until 10:30.  I'm a bit angry because my article and two others will not run tomorrow except for on-line - aka they will never be read.  We have so many sports stories to run on Friday's I don't know why I even write match previews, there isn't enough space for them.  On the other hand, other beats write over the amount of inches they are told to and they go and fill the entire section.  I know no one likes cross country, but I know that very few people give a shit about field hockey, or at least 20 inches of it. Man that is such bull shit, oh well, maybe next quarter I will get a more important beat, or I will just write columns.  
Good news from The Post too though.  I talked Chris, the culture editor, to let me write the American Idiot review for Tuesday, booyah!  The album isn't too bad, I liked a few songs, and after one listen I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5.   Score one Nick - bitches.
I think I am going to crank some Whigs and relax.  Good night."

"event","So it's been over a week since I've updated the old blog.  I can't help it, I've been A) really busy lately and B) very lazy at the same time.  Been spending a bunch of time at The Post.  I even had my first column run today.  I am pretty pleased with how it turned out and I've even had feedback about it.  One good and one bad e-mail so I am happy with that.  The coolest part was that a local AM radio station sports talk show host read my article, sent me an e-mail, and had me talk on his show today for about 15 minutes.  It was fun and encouraging at the same time.  Someone actually read my article and thought it was of a high enough quality to have a half hour talk show on the topic.  Maybe that's just the ego talking, it doesn't really matter, I am pleased with the results anyhow.  
It's been getting chilly at night and in the mornings, really pissing me off.  At least it hasn't rained in 6 days.  Last Friday, thanks to hurricane Ivan, Athens was flooded (for the most part).  We have had a lot of rain before, but it was pretty out of control.  The power went out in my dorm for about two hours due to the storm and I think I had to change clothes three times.  A bit inconvenient.  
Last week's poker results were good and bad.  First the bad.  Midnight poker at baker was horrible.  I was dealt the worst cards I was ever dealt in my life.  i didn't win a hand, even though I played great and made excellent reads.  But to quote Phil hellmuth [sic] ""If it wasn't for luck, I'd win every game"".  Okay, that is a bit of an exaggeration.  even though I had a bad night Friday, I won two cash games last weekend with Dane, Parker, Jeff, and Eli.  Good times.  I net about 12 bucks,I think.  Either way it is fun to play some serious poker.  I gave up playing Yahoo hold 'em because it hurt my game.  Playing with free fake money and being a low-limit game, I could see any hand to the flop or at least turn.  It reflected in my game at the first midnight poker, however I have corrected the problem.  Enough poke talk, there will be more games this weekend.  
This live Afghan Whigs boot rocks out, big time.  I've listened to it about a dozen times in three days.  They are an excellent live and studio band.
I am out for now, time to run up town with some people and grab some Goodfellas pizza."

"event","So the weekend wasn't very exciting.  I expected to get more done over the three day break (because of labs being canceled), but I didn't do much except for lounge around.  I can't remember the last time I was so lethargic.  
However, I did go to the midnight poker game at Baker and had a pretty good time.  It's an excellent deal.  It's free and you have a chance at winning movie tickets each week and the final game of the quarter - which will be a final table of all the winners this quarter - wins an I-pod.  I didn't play as well as I should have.  I took an early chip lead, but as the game went on I found myself playing too many hands (Yahoo hands as I call them).  I did however play some hands very well and made some excellent reads.  But I did make a huge mistake and it cost me reaching the final table of the night.  I was dealt pocket A2 of hearts for the third time of the night and played to the flop.  The flop was A,2,Q.  I was playing heads up with a very tight player so I knew he had an A,Q and he bet 500 on the hand, for some reason I called, I still don't know why.  I called the 500 looking for another 2 or heart for a potential flush, however neither came.  He fired another 500 and I couldn't do anything but fold and take my losses.  He did show his A,Q though, so my read was correct, I just played the hand very poorly.  
Later on in the night I made my best play of the night.  I was dealt 2,4 of clubs and it was three handed to the flop.  The flop was A, 6 of clubs, and 8 of clubs.  I had a good feeling for the flush and waited to see how the betting would take place.  The guy first to act bet all-in, with a very large stack, I knew he had at least one ace, the other player folded to me.  Being short stacked I called and turned over my cards.  He had pocket aces, however I was feeling good for the flush.  The turn came and the jack of clubs turned up.  I busted pocket aces and doubled up on my chips.  Good times.  
Enough poker talk, I will mostly post about it again later this week.  Other than that, I did my article for The Post, read a bit for my classes, and continued to rest.
I'm bored so I am going to get ready to go to class."

"event","I am really glad Chris introduced me to The Afghan Whigs.  Since I heard him play a record of theirs in his car I've really liked them.  There are a unique band that made some excellent music.  So here is a list of my favorite bands and the people who have introduced them to me.  (no particular order)

Tool - My brother Tony first played the record ""Undertow"" for me when I was in 8th grade and I've been hooked since.  
Metallica - I actually heard them on the radio first and looked into them further on my own doing when I purchased ""Kill 'em All"".
Pink Floyd - My dad always had ""Dark Side of the Moon"" so I grew up listening to them.  
Rush and Dream Theater - David really got me into these progressive rock phenoms.  Both of these bands have some of the most talented line ups in rock.
Pearl Jam - Another band Chris got me into to.  I knew a lot of their songs before I actually knew it was them, but now I enjoy a lot more than the hits.
Yes - Travis played these prog rock legends to me.  These guys push music to the edge and then a little bit more.  
A Perfect Circle - I kind of got into them myself after learning about Maynard's side project.  

Those are my favorite bands, if I get ambitious I might post my top ten favorite albums or songs later."

Thank you Frances, everyone appreciates the gargantuan amounts of rain you are bestowing upon us.  
So anyways, I had Soc today at 3.  I have a feeling the course will be a bit annoying, because the class isn't going to be tough, but I have a prof who feels it is her job to make any class important and difficult.  I can't stand that kind of stuff.  
I pretty much finished my article for this week.  I just have to wait for Matt, the sports editor, to review and okay everything tomorrow.  I kind of like working at The Post, it gives me something to do and I am actually learning things (imagine that).

"event","So far so good.  My classes don't seem that hard this quarter, so I am sure I'll be slacking a bunch like last year.  Graphics is all right, the prof is a humorous man who reminds me of Marvin (I think that's his name)from The Simpsons.  It's funny, because I talked to him at the beginning of last year about getting into Scripps and he was quite condescending toward me.  However, he seems like an okay guy.  He has played old doo-wop music in the morning before class and it is surprising how so few people actually know of the groups he plays.  I guess I have an advantage from growing up listening to the Oldies station.  Another plus in that class is that I know a handful of people in there with me.  
Info gathering appears to be a boring class full of busy work, but I'll have to put up with it, because the class is required.  The prof reminds me of Ben Stein (though I don't know if he is Jewish).
IART is okay.  I think I will like the class even though I am still a bit perturbed from the teacher playing ""Hey Ya"" in class.  It is a small class so I might get to know some people in it.  
As for Sociology of the family, I don't know.  I go there at 3 for the first class.  
I've spent a lot of time at The Post over the last two days.  Monday night I worked late night designing (or learning) the sports page.  And yesterday I went in to work on my article.  I like the people I work with, they all seem relaxed and helpful if I have any questions.  That's all I have to say right now.  Good day."

Out of seven people that all said they would attend, six of them backed out, and I'm not going to play poker with one person.  People were ""tired"", ""busy"", etc.  Oh well, I guess I'll have to keep waiting to play a good game of cards, because Yahoo just isn't cutting it.
The past three days have been extremely boring with the exception of going to a movie last night.  A bunch of people went to see Garden State and I was invited.  It turned out to be a really good movie.  It was funny, had a great soundtrack, and was very well written.  
Matt from The Post has assigned me to cover cross country instead of volleyball.  I am cool with it, because it will be less work and still get me in the door to eventually cover basketball.  I took a walk tonight (when I found out the poker game wasn't going to happen) to get some fresh air and to be out of my room.

The worst part was having to haul things up to the 4th floor by stairs, because using the elevator on move-on days is nearly impossible.  Anyways, the room is awesome.  I can't begin to explain how much ass it kicks.  It's so big, I can actually walk around in it, unlike last year.  I have everything positioned where I want it and can't believe how nicely it all fit.  The carpet fits perfect and with a few modifications to the desk and moving the computer to the floor instead of leaving it on the desk, my space is used perfectly.  
After I got the room set up, I went up-town.  I bought my books which cost nearly 200 bucks, then stopped at another book store to buy a longer cable wire for my tv and pick up a copy of The Onion.  I came back and reheated the lasagna Maria gave me and drank my last Slice.  I desperately need to go to Walmart and buy food and drinks.  I've only met one person in my hall so far (no one else has moved in) and he's a pretty good guy.  He plays guitar and knew I was listening to Rush, so he can't be that bad. 
I've been bored most of the night and haven't done much but watch tv and play guitar.  I might go for a walk up-town just to get some air, but other than that I don't plan on doing much.  Tomorrow I will go to the football game and most likely get a terrible sunburn.  The poker tournament will still go on even though I had to change the time to 10 instead of 8, because of a meeting for The Post.

What an exciting Friday night.  My day went as so.  
1.  Woke up around 11:30.
2.  Watched the entire second disc of Aqua Teen Hunger Force Volume 2.  Commentary and all special features included.  
3.  Ate lunch/dinner.
4.  Read ""The Dream of a Ridiculous Man"" by Fyodor Dostoevsky.  The ""Mad Russian"" as Stewie from Family Guy calls him.  It was an entertaining short story.  It was good to read again.  I usually never read on summer break, but I really enjoy Dostoevsky.  I think my favorite book of his is ""The Gambler"".  
5.  Pulled out more dead plants in the garden, then hoed and raked the garden.  

An odd last Friday before I go back to school, but what the heck."

"event","Good old Family Guy.  Maybe FOX will continue to play these marathons until the new epsiodes come out.  
Today was okay.  I had the day off so I slept in late and spent the day watching The Simpsons on DVD.  
I only have three more days to work and then I'm off for good.  Work hasn't been to bad except for dealing with the idiotic conversations I am exposed to daily by the stupid, over-weight, worthless bitches that are my ""co-workers"".  The shit these people babble about drives me insane.  I've heard half-hour conversations on breath mints.  Breath mints!  Then I hear the same BS dialogues about dieting and why everyone's isn't working.  Hmmm, maybe it's because all you do is eat and watch television.  Jesus Christ.  At least pull the god damned Beef and Cheddar out of your mouth while you complain about how you have only lost 5 pounds in 3 months.  
I'm tired of all this low-carb, no-carb, all carb fucking dieting.  In fact, I am tired of hearing aobut any dieting what-so-ever.  Your fat becasue you are lazy and eat too much, period.  Counting carbs and bull shit points at Weight Watchers isn't going to do anything for you when you eat three Chalupas during a shiftf 5 hours.  I've known people who lost weight, and they did it by working out or running daily and by putting the fucking fork down.  It's not impossible if you have a litte self control and discipline.  You can't lose weight for the same reason you can't keep a good job.  You are a lazy bitch who won't put any effort into working towards a goal.  There, I've had that on my chest for a while.
So I move in the weekend of Labor day,  I'm not sure if it will be Friday or Saturday.  Anyways, I am more interested in going back this year, because I've got a new, much larger room than my prison cell last year.  Plus I have moved up two floors and won't have to deal with the immature fucks I did before.  Hearing stupid, spoiled, rich kids run through the halls screaming and making the same jokes about farting and taking a shit.  Dipshits complaining how they are poor yet they have a brand new laptop and PC.  It's funny how these ""poor"" people always had stocked microfridges full of expensive ice cream and frozen meals.
A good thing about my room thought is that it is a corner room with two windows and I'm going to have carpet to bring with me this year.  
Well I'm done ranting for the night."

"event","Not much to say tonight.  A simple day really.  I woke up around 11 o'clock and watched some episodes of The Simpsons on DVD.  Around 3 we went to the stores so I could buy the shit I needed for school.  We ate at Toots and I had a Toot's burger with Onion rings.  It was a good lunch.  
I got home and pulled up more dead plants in the garden then watched Kill Bill 2.  Seeing it again reminded me of how great a writer Tarantino is. 
Other than that I haven't done much of anything else but lounge and enjoy the day.  I don't have anything else to say."

"event","Of course it rained tonight, I knew it would.  The concert went on anyhow.  We played in Travis' living room and didn't get to crank the amps as we wanted to.  A total of 5 people came to watch/play video games/swim and I guess they liked it, I don't know, maybe not.  The set went well, we only goofed up a couple parts in some of the songs.  And as my luck goes, I broke my D string in the middle of ""Rocking in the Free World"", so I had to unplug (as Chris and Travis kept the song going with an extended interlude) and grab Travis' cheap little Squire Strat which I threw on and finished the song with.  I guess it could have been worse.  I think we played ""Sober"" and ""Rearview Mirror"", and our originals ""American Beheaded"" and ""House Arrest"" the best out of all the songs.  
We got DSL on the computer here at home finally today and the installation wasn't too big of a hassle.  Now I can check my mail and use the internet without snail-like speeds and constantly being booted.  It isn't lightning fast, but it is better than before and we don't tie up the phone line while on (my dad's favorite part).
Sleeping in was awesome today, I was able to wake up at my own time and not feel like I was run over by a truck when I got going.  
I think I am going to watch the Lewis Black DVD I bought now.  I think he is one of the few people that are as angry and annoyed by everything as me.  Good night."

-weekend started tonight
-got out of work at 4
-got new glasses
-ready for the show as long as it doesn't rain

I don't feel like writing anything else thanks to the excellent timing of my computer and its disconnection.  
Time to play some Yahoo hold 'em.

"event","I just finished watching the Family Guy marathon on FOX.  It's about time the show has been brought back to FOX and getting some prime time air time.  FOX should have never canceled the show in the first place, but I am glad new episodes are being produced and due out in hopefully the not to distant future.  I think it was the novelty of seeing the episodes back on television and fitted with all the original breaks, even though I like Adult Swim's two commercial break version, that made the showing enjoyable.  Though I did notice a lot of jokes and words pulled out by FOX which is ridiculous.  Brian couldn't say ""dump"" as in ""take a dump"", WTF?  I think I'll bust out the Family Guy DVDs soon once I am finished watching volume 3 of The Simpsons.  
Work was okay, I got out of there at 6:30 which is a lot better than yesterday and when I got home I pulled up the dead plants in the garden that have died from the cold.  John and I had some good laughs and were cracking jokes most the day about two other co-workers who we can't stand.  This John is a different than the John from Sunday... if that means anything.  I don't really feel like explaining anymore.  
After tomorrow I get three days off which is awesome.  I have been so tired I can barely stay awake at work, at I find myself leaning on things to stay up.  I hope to catch up on sleep tonight, but it probably won't happen because I am still up.  I guess I will be miserable tomorrow and sleep in to about 1:30 Friday.  
I hope it doesn't rain Friday night so that the show can go on.  I don't know why I call it a show, it isn't really.  More like a rehearsal outside.  I am mainly looking forward to blasting my Marshall, I still haven't had it over 6 and I have had it for a long time.  I'm going to turn my gain up to 11 on a few songs to get a sweet tone like Carl Bell.  It's going to be sweet.
On a different note I got a funny thing to say...or write.  Jim is a great guy and excellent boss, but his one flaw is that he is very religious man.  He reads the bible every night, so he says, and unfortunately he listens to Christian music stations on the ride to and from.  I'd usually say something, but it's his car and his choice so I try to zone it out.  Man it is terrible.  Then he went to the point of telling me I'd be interested or might like the Christian rock program they play.  I played along but really knew I'd never check it out.  Let me borrow a joke from David's stand up routine, ""Some people call Christian rock hypocritical, but I have a better word for it........suck.""  Oh man that is good times.  It sucks that David will not be returning to OU this year, but that's the way it goes.  I understand him wanting to be closer to home and his band mates.  It just blows that one of the few friends I had at college won't be there.  Oh well.
I don't see myself making many friends this year.  I get uncomfortable talking to people and the whole process of making friends, and the fact that I hate people, but I won't have as much free time this year so it won't matter.  Juggling writing for the post, which I've been told will be a big time consumption, and writing for Friday's live along with class work.  By the way, Friday's live is the shit show my college has that is pretty much a SNL copy and I wrote for last year.  However the producers never let any the good, envelope pushing sketches David, Charley, and I would write on air.  Hopefully, this year it will be better with a new head writer and producer.
Well, I am tired of writing and I'm in dire need of sleep so I am going to attempt to snooze off.  Good night."

"event","I'm busy watching the World Series of Poker on ESPN right now, so this entry might be a bit all around.  
     I'm not sure what it is about poker and the whole gambling thing, but I really enjoy it.  Maybe it is that I do and enjoy very few things, but nothing entertains me more than playing poker with friends/family (except for playing music and writing comedy).  I like the rush of winning big and risk of losing and am hoping to get into some games, maybe tournaments when I return to Athens and see how my game has improved since the end of June.  I've been looking to play some here at home, but it seems no one wants to play or scheduling makes it damn near impossible.  Oh well.
     In other news work was long as hell.  I sure love putting in 12 hour days, especially when I have to go in at 7:30 in the morning.  Jim (my ride) and I were scheduled off at 5, but then ended up staying to 7:45.  So many people quit and call off there, I don't know how the store functions.  We had to stick around until the mongoloid arrived at 7:30 (he was called in) and was complaining about how he hates work, I think, half the time- no- about 75% of the time I can't understand what the hell he is saying.  Luckily the day was busy so it didn't seem as long as it was.  I got home, ate dinner (some kind of pasta that Maria made) and now (the wsop just ended by the way) I am wasting the night before I go to bed.
     Hold that thought, I have to let Bowser (my dog) out.  Now that that is done, I can't think of anything else that is worth mentioning so I shall hit the hay.  Good night."

"event","All right, first the bad,terrible news.  When I got home from work today my dad told me how the 9,500 bucks I borrowed with a student loan would end up costing me a grand total of 21,275 dollars when I pay it off.  Fantastic.  That is over 100% in interest, which is un-fucking-believable.  This is the kind of shit that makes me hate everything.  21,275 dollars.......
     Anyways, now the moderately  good news.  I got an e-mail informing me that I got a scholarship from Ohio Lions/Helen Keller for 2750 bucks.  I should be happy to get anything, but this 2750 is just as insulting as the Deans scholarship worth an amazing 1250.  I have realized what I've earned for getting a 3.93 gpa and for belonging to the E.W. Scripps School of Journalism.  College can kiss my ass.
     Onto something that doesn't make me want to rape and pillage small villages...work!  Today Jim, the big boss man, had the day off.  So Tabitha was in charge which is the equivalent to giving an ape keys and a manager card.  Nothing gets done, people slack off more than usual, and as usual I end up doing all the work.  Why do I find it amusing that I work harder than grown adults?  Oh well, I am glad I quit next Tuesday.  
      Friday, will be a busy day.  I am taking the day off so my family can get DSL installed on the computer as well as having the cable guys coming to remove our cable boxes, because my dad is refusing to pay for the movie channels.  Then most important, the big show.  
      For those who don't know, my semi-band is playing an end of summer pool party at Travis, the drummer's house Friday night at 6.  This ought to be fun, because Chris and I will blast our amps as loud as they can go.  11 is looking pretty good.  If you want to come contact me, Chris, or Travis and get directions.  
     Well, I am tired of typing so it is time to end this post.  Good night."

"event","Well, just trying out the whole ""blog"" thing. I am already tired of this, mainly because it took me way too long to get my account started.  My other options for my user names weren't available, so I went with this cheesed-out one.  
     I don't plan on putting anything very insightful on here or anything that interesting, mostly the boring events that happen in my life and occasionly some jokes or bits I want to write down (except for I am too lazy to actually write them down, that involves pen and paper) for my stand-up routines.........but I probably won't.
     Work blew, as usual.  For those of you who don't know I work at Taco Hell in Milford.  One good thing about today is that I didn't have to work with the typical mongoloids (one in particular) I usually do. Thank Satan I stop working next Tuesday and can lounge until I go back to Athens.  Again for those of you who don't know I attend Ohio University, not Ohio State University in Columbus, so don't ask me about the damn Buckeyes.  College football interests me about as much as watching dry paint dry. 
     At least work was slow which allowed for a lot of standing around time and I managed to talk it up with John about how he is going to Canada next week to visit the casinos.  John is one of the maybe 3 people I talk to at work because everyone there annoys me and have the IQ of a retarded chimpanzee.  I have to work Monday-Thursday this week with the grueling and usual hours of 7:30 to 6:00.  I hate work mainly because I don't get payed near enough and I still haven't got my fucking raise I was supposed to get in June.  
    Well, I'm getting off here because I hate thinking about work, especially when I have to work the next day.  Anyways, it's time to listen to Adam rant on Love Line.  I'm gone."

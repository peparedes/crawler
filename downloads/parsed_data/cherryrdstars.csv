last night kenney terrell and gregg had a par-tay, and i got completely smashed.  played i never, and it only ended in lots of everclear and lemonade, a suprisingly tasty and alcoholic drink.  i think i was beligerant, but i dont really know, but i did wake up at home this morning and matt didnt drink, so i can only assume he hauled my drunk ass home after i passed out or something.  how sweet he is.

i have lost 5 pounds in the last week and a half.  dieters and fat people everywhere will want me dead.

they gave me prescription stregth iburophen that if i dont take fairly religiously every 6 hours my fever will shoot back up (believe me on this one, the whole up and down thing is what i did all weekend), and an antibiotic even though they dont think its bacterial, ""just in case"" i have something bacterial AND a virus.  

i missed call all this weekend and i feel terrible, i threw my guts up this morning (i think i irritated my stomach from all the medicine cause i cant really eat and my tummy doesnt like me right now) and my stomach hurt so bad i didnt go to class. which i cant really afford to do, but.  yeah.  i suck.

selfishly, i just want to be better not for class but so that i can enjoy a trip to london next week and get wasted and eat sushi and not worry about infecting everyone with some weird virus that has never existed before me.

sorry to be so melodramatic, but i feel like shit and i have to go to lab.

i feel like i dont know whats true and real and i never will
how discouraging that is...

i have french and a test today, and i wish i didnt have either, so i could just sit and figure out why things are the way they are and why i am the way i am

taking baby steps frustrates me to no end, because i am not patient
i just want to know where we will end up
so i know if its worth the hurt that i feel now
selfish and wrong, that is
but at least im honest
but then again...in all fairness, i would hurt either way

and all that last rant-matt and i got into a huge fight, but absolutely nothing got resolved, i still have all this pent up emotion and i dont know how to tell him cause its never the right time.  i just love him so much, he is the best thing that ever happened to me, he is so sweet and takes such good care of me whenever i need him, but i feel so...i dont know.  i guess i have to bring it up and (once again) be the bad guy who just can be satisfied with what they have.

i just have no motivation for anything and i feel myself falling back into where i was earlier this semster and i hate it.  i just want it all to be over.  i am so sick of crying."

and you know what?  I CAN BE MAD IF I WANT TO.  it hurts my feelings the way that i am the one that has to keep bending over and fucking taking it cause we dont want to hurt someone else's feelings.  if i am the most important, then why dont i feel like it?  god forbid we hurt HER feelings.  since it is so important to keep HER happy.

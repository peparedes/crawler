&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert shook his head. ""Forget it. I've already got one.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minaym looked around the room, a puzzled expression on his face. ""You may have had some sort of experience before, but nothing like this, I promise you.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert had a sudden hopefuly thought. ""I don't suppose it's a vacation to America? And I could skip the round trip part?""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Ah, no, I'm afraid not. We've got something quite different mind. You have to realize, this is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here. The A.O.D.C. would like to extend to...""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert interrupted him. ""A.O.D.C.?""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Yes, it's a company based in Arcturus.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Named?""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""A.O.D.C.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Which stands for?""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Oh, ah, well, Arcturus,"" and here Minayme mumbled, then coughed slightly, before finishing, ""Company.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""I'm afraid I didn't quite catch that middle bit.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Arcturus Offal Disposal Company."" He frowned, then hurried on. ""Not that that has anything to do with what we actually do now. It's just the name of the original company, but the Arcturans don't believe in renaming the company as it diversifies. Nor do they believe in branding differently for different species. Anyway. We would like to extend to you the offer to go on a all-expenses-paid tour of the galaxy. You'll see all the great sights there are to see. And there are a lot of them,"" he hastened to amend.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""I'm not interested,"" said Rupert.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Please, have a seat, let me explain it in more detail. If you're still not interested, then we will go.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert shrugged. ""Do you mind if I make myself something to eat first?""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Not at all. Your comfort is our greatest concern. A.O.D.C owns several hundred luxurious space liners, so you, and a guest should  you desire, will travel in comfort and style.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert carefully trimmed the crusts off two slices of bread in preparation for a simple peanut-butter sandwich. ""How long is the trip?""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minayme said, ""All told, your tour will take you about a year and a half."" Rupert started, his fingers opening. Minayme looked at him disappointedly. ""Navigating through hyperspace ain't like dropping crusts, boy. Sure, the gates get you from point B to point C instantaneously, but you still have to get from A to B and C to D at sublight speeds.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert finished recovering his bread clippings and properly disposing of them. ""That's still an awfully long time.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Perhaps, but it's a worthwhile price to pay to see the wonders of the galaxy.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""How do I know that halfway through the trip you guys won't go out of business, leaving me stranded at the other end of the galaxy? Heck, I don't suppose you guys own O'Toole's Estate Sales and Tourism Company.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minayme shrugged. ""Never heard of it. And A.O.D.C is a prestigious GalactiCorp. Nothing could happen to it so quickly.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert shook his head. ""No, I've gotten burned this way before. 'Free, expenses-paid vacation to Europe! You'll love it!' I'd be stupid to fall for it again. You know that saying: fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, I hope I die before I get old.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minayme frowned. ""Is there any way we could change your mind?""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Rupert could offer a resounding ""no"", his front door swung open, and Midnight strode in. ""Hey, Rupe,"" she said, ""I wanted to talk about our plans for the weekend... oh, hullo. You've got guests. And one of them has both of his arms and a leg raised.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert replied, ""They were just leaving... no, wait, they weren't."" If they were leaving, he'd have to talk to her... alone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minayme studied her. ""We're here to offer Mr. Hooper a chance to take a tour of the galaxy... at our expense. He's not going for it.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Oh! I've always wanted to see the galaxy! Let's do it, Rupe!""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""You can go if you want, but I'm staying.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midnight turned to Minayme, who shook his head. ""I'm afraid the offer is only for Mr. Hooper.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert said, ""But you said 'and guest'.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Well, yes. If you go, you can bring a guest. If you do not go, then you cannot bring a guest, since you are not going, and thus bringing is not possible. You could send a guest, instead of bringing one, perhaps, but since you wouldn't be there, such a person would hardly be <i>your</i> guest at all, but that is what the offer is, <i>your</i> guest, not ours.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midnight turned back to Rupert. ""Oh, please, please, it'll be great fun, and it'll be our first trip together!""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""I just want to get back to America.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""On our return, could you drop us in America instead of here?""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Sure.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Yay! How does that sound, Rupe?""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""The whole thing just sounds too good to be true, Midnight. Given my current circumstances, I have no willingness to trust this.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Well then,"" said Midnight, ""good thing I happen to have a truth detector on me."" She immediately produced what looked like a little plastic cartoon squirrel.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, dear reader, might think that this was awfully convenient; in fact, you might wonder whether anyone else thought similarly. Let us look into Rupert's thoughts for a moment. Rupert had, in fact, had just the same thought. And not only did he think to himself that it was awfully convenient, but as well it struck him as the sort of thing that would happen to the protagonist in an awful, melodramatic science fiction story--er, nevermind, let's not look into Rupert's thoughts.<sup>1</sup>

<small><sup>1</sup> Those readers who take this paragraph as being a bunch of superficial nonsense and further evidence that this author really needs an editor to trim out the crap should realize that, in fact, this paragraph is very important to the story, as they will eventually discover. Those who think this paragraph is evidence that the author is being paid by the word for this story should be informed that the author is, in fact, not so being paid.<sup>2</sup>
<sup>2</sup> Those readers who are critics or reviewers who cannot be bothered to determine the way in which the pararaph in question is in fact important: the paragraph is important because there is a huge twist towards the end of the story, and this paragraph foreshadows it and also offers a clue to it.<sup>3</sup>
<sup>3</sup> Those readers who are critics and reviewers who have read the whole story and returned here to verify it: actually the last footnote was a total lie so as not to spoil what occurs in the latter half of the story. In truth, the paragraph in question provides several clues to a secret, hidden bit of back story which explains many of the things which transpire throughout that are otherwise inexplicable.<sup>4</sup>
<sup>4</sup>Those readers who are writing their own works at the same time as this author: Nyah nyah. I thought of it first.</small>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth detector was another of those various gadgets humanity had developed with the help and prompting of various helpful alien races. Everyone was familiar with the inaccuracy and general useless of the existing lie detectors, and the need to replace them with something better. But until the aliens came around, nobody knew how.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once they did, it was simple. Detecting truths was, in practice, much easier than detecting lies; if something was a fact, something true in the world, this could, via various surprising properties of the new even-more-mysterious theory that had replaced quantum mechanics, be easily verified. However, it only worked for simple facts; the truth detector did not parse complex logical statements, nor could it judge mathematical truths or what women really meant. People new to the idea of the truth detector, which made a pleasant beep when it heard a true statement, thought that a lie detector could just as easily be constructed by negating the sense of the truth detector, but this turned out to not work, since in addition to telling lies and truths, people can make false statements that they believe are true, or simply spout nonsense. As such, the truth detector turned out to in practice be pretty much useless, and in the end it was only manufactured as a children's toy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She held it facing Minayme. ""Your name?""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""I am called Minayme.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirrel chirped happily.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Yes, but what is it?""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""I work for A.O.D.C., a major Galacticorp.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirrel chirped happily.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""I am made of green cheese.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirrel sat there, silent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Just checking. I am human.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirrel chirped happily.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""I am offering Mr. Rupert Hooper an all-expenses paid tour of the galaxy.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirrel chirped happily.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert said, ""You're not going to go out of business when we're out there?""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""We're not."" He paused, to silence. ""Sorry. To the best of my knowledge, A.O.D.C. is solvent and we will have no problem bringing you back to Earth.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirrel chirped happily.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""You are going to bring us back.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Yes."" More silence. ""Sorry, I can't predict the future. The plan is to take you all over the galaxy, and the plan is to bring you back.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirrel chirped happily.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""And a guest,"" offered Midnight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""And you can bring a guest for free,"" Minayme replied.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squirrel chirped happily."

"event","<lj-cut text=""chapter 3 begins"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert stared at the hallway to his flat. His last several encounters with the woman from above his flat, Midnight, had led him to conclude that life would be better for all concerned if she didn't know he was home. Assuming, at least, that the only person concerned was himself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He snuck silently down the hall to his flat. He hadn't encountered Midnight anywhere but this hall--yet--and as far as he could recall he hadn't spoken to her; hadn't even given her the time of day. Except the one time she had asked him the time, and he had told her. But she seemed to somehow think they had had some significant conversations; or at least, she seemed to think that they were dating--in fact, not merely dating, but boyfriend and girlfriend.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he unlocked his door, he rolled words over on his tongue. ""Tenavate. Sev inf if tea."" It had been around that time, although he couldn't remember how he'd phrased it. Nothing plausible jumped out. ""Quart or revate. Half past seven.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened silently--thanks to the recent oiling he'd given the hinges--and he pulled the door closed. Then he sensed something--a barely heard noise, perhaps--there was someone in the room with him. He left the door unlocked, anticipating the need for a rapid escape.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flicked on the lights, and swiftly swept his eyes across the room. There, in his favorite armchair, slouched a man. A man he'd never seen before. Middle-aged, mustachioed, and marking his place in a book that he now closed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert launched into the stranger. ""What do you think you're doing, breaking into my apartment and sitting in my favorite chair like that? You'll wreck your back with that posture--sit up straight. And you'll go blind trying to read in the dark!""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""My name,"" the man said, ""is Minaym."" Or perhaps he said ""Minaym is my name""; it wasn't clear. Which was unfortunate; Rupert would look stupid if he had to ask the man to clarify the pronunciation after he'd just said his name. But since he'd accented the second syllable the first time, and the first syllable the second, Rupert was definitely uncertain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""And mine... is Rupert.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""I know,"" replied Minaym.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aha! Rupert had been testing a theory--that if Minaym had said ""Minaym is <i>my</i> name"", then he was waiting for Rupert to reveal his own. Clearly, that was not the case. Rupert smiled; Sherlock Holmes had nothing on Rupert's powers of observation and deduction.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Well, Mr. Minaym"", said Rupert, carefully stressing the first syllable of the name, ""what is it you want?""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Minaym,"" corrected Minaym, accenting the second syllable. ""And as to that...""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Wait, if it's 'mi<i>naym</i>', then why'd you stress that this was <i>your</i> name if you already knew mine?""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Hmm? Oh, because it's <i>my</i> name. I can't speak for the other fellow with me.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert followed his gesture and noticed for the first time the tall fellow by the window.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""And as to what we want... we want to make you an offer."" He held up his hand as Rupert started to speak. ""We're not selling anything."" He raised his other hand as Rupert tried to speak again. ""We're not leasing anything, either.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert opened his mouth, but Minaym raised his right leg. ""No, we're not trying to convert you to our religion."" Rupert paused for a moment in thought, and then, just as his lips began to tremble, Minaym cut him off with a raised eyebrow. ""And we're not here to tell you you've won an all-expenses paid, round-trip vacation... oh wait, we are.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rupert shook his head. ""Forget it. I've already got one."""

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be unfair to say that they were foul things. The things were unkempt, frequently misshapen, and consistently smelly. Bits of leather tied with woven cord were wrapped around them in a mockery of an attempt to protect them from the elements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things were, to put it bluntly, not the kind of things you'd want standing around in your parlor, much less your mother's. (Your humble narrator happens to like his spouse's family, and so will not deign to make the obvious mother-in-law followup.)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, this particular collection of things were marching through the desolate wilderness of a planet whose native name translates roughly to ""planet which was foul but is now fair"", which is rather strange since any outside observer would have thought the opposite.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things which were afoot were feet."

"event","<lj-cut text=""a little bit more"">&nbsp;&nbsp; By apparent total coincidence, this was at exactly the same moment that the few first alien spacecraft descended from the heavens, undetected, and landed without fanfare in numerous abandoned drive-in movie theaters across the Western world. Much to _their_ surprise as well.
&nbsp;&nbsp So many things that had happened since then galled him, each one set in motion in a cascading chain of events from the alien arrival, like unstoppable dominoes: the disappearance of the computer programming profession, and with it his job; the ionization of the atmosphere; the revival of the acting career of Yahoo Serious. But what really galled him was his own stupidity in getting trapped in London, unable to return to the U.S. and his home in Idaho, the Solid State.
&nbsp;&nbsp He turned and looked for the glittering thin line disappearing into the heavens far to the north, recalled his descent along it when he first arrived, two months ago. The ascent and descent on the space elevators took more time than the actual orbital time getting from the one to the other; longer than an airplane ride, but far faster than an ocean-going vessel would be. Not that those had berths available; those he could afford. A trip back on the space elevators was well beyond his means, especially since he'd spent as much as he had on private investigators, trying to track down the tangled web of ownership behind the O'Toole Estate Sales and Tourism Company--the company that had put him in this position in the first place. It was the estate sales that had made it surprisingly expensive; nobody wanted to investigate too deeply a company involved in estate sales. People who did had a tendency to get liquidated.
&nbsp;&nbsp He walked about for several hours, his circuitous path the same as it had been in the previous weeks. He was, he thought, nodding to people he recognized from previous rounds, starting to become something of a fixture around these parts, a lighting fixture specifically: overlooked and irrelevant."

&nbsp;&nbsp;   Those twenty kilos were just hyperbole, mind; in truth he checked his pocket instead for his PAPERZ, a device whose acronym, in typically awful beauracratic fashion, stood for 'Patriotic Automatic Personal Examiner/Responder Zoop' (the last word's meaning being top secret), and whose functioning was at a minimum to identify him and report his current location, but whose other functions could only be guessed at, especially its propensity for humming the tune to ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"".
&nbsp;&nbsp;   The zoop was clearly a product of the new age of self-configuring quantum computers, holographic storage, and orthopedic networking. Rupert remembered the time before such novelties, back when he actually had a job at a computer programmer, and remembered that day a few years back when everything changed: the day the unmanned probe to Jupiter returned with the mysterious slab. The slab had been orbiting Jupiter, and the probe had come across it by chance. People drew conclusions that it was a sign of intelligent life; from its unnatural proportions (1 by 13 by 52) to its strange crinkly shape that was not clearly resolved (due to unexplained damage the main camera had taken earlier). The day the probe returned to the Earth, NASA scientists hosted a live broadcast as they opened the airlock to discover just what they'd brought back. Millions of viewers around the globe tuned or logged: schoolchildren got a break from their classroom advertisements; heads of state put off their Tiddlywinks championships to watch; and naturally  SETI and other stargazers turned their attention terrestrially. They all watched to see the discovery of the century, which turned out to be a strip of bacon the previous <i>manned</i> probe to Jupiter had accidentally ejected.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature abhors a vacuum, and so did Rupert. The difference being that Rupert abhorred a very specific vacuum: the one that, without fail, started up every Saturday morning at nine in the A.M. in the flat above his.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first inclination, as it had been for the previous four Saturdays (and so perhaps it would be more accurate to say 'his thirteenth inclination'), was to complain to the landlady, Mrs. Widdershins. But she had already done him the favor of letting him the room at well below any reasonable rate, and he didn't want to be a bother and risk compromising his tentative position.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second inclination (or perhaps fourteenth) was to go upstairs and give the door to the flat above his a sound thrashing. Not that the vacuum was the door's fault, really, but it seemed rather un-British to give the <i>tenent</i> the sound thrashing that would be deserved if this were, say, New York, and so he thought it best to strike a compromise, literally.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he could move on to his fifteenth inclination, the one that had won out in previous weeks, he found himself levering himself up out of his comfy chair, out the door, up the stairs, to the landing, and to the spoiled brat of a door that awaited punishment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last moment he pardoned the door. He still rapped rather louder than politeness would dictate--hoping to make himself heard over the lack of din from the vacuum inside, it having switched off just as his hand flew doorwards.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thwack thwack thwack! His rap echoed through the unexpected stillness like a clunking steps of a Falavian down a street suddenly silent due to its very presence. The door swung open, revealing a handsome, brooding young man with an electrifying presence. Then a woman stepped out in front of the James Dean poster from behind the door and regarded him in turn.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hair was dandelion, her lips brick red, her eyes granny smith apple, her complexion burnt sienna, and her hyponychium cerulean. She was tall, as tall as Rupert was when he wasn't hunched over by the weight of an oppressive society that demanded he tote twenty kilograms of personal documentation and tracking devices everywhere he went"

"event","so yeah....im sick of people here in jacksonville that find it neccessary to want to know everything about me. i am also sick of a certain someone that will not leave me be. i tried being nice. i tried talking to you. i have tried being mean. then i have tried being nice again. i am not too sure what i should do anymore. I love you but jesus christ just leave me alone. there is a reason why I did what I did. if i wanted you to constantly know my business and know everything about me I will let you know. otherwise please keep my name out of your mouth and will do the same for you,(like i have done these past few weeks). i mean really its over. if there was ever, ever, ever, going to be a chance of anything happening you are constantly bringing the  chances down. please, please, please, get over me leave me alone, stop talking about me, stop trying to find out what i am doing, stop for the love of god. I love everybody, i swear....i just hate stupid people every now and then. but for the most part i still love dumb people....kinda contradictory...oh well"

"event","Well it has been quite some time since I have updated. hmm...

I have:
1. Marched Drum Corps
2. Pledged Phi Mu Alpha
3. been happily together with Ashlie for 7 months...

My life has been quite crazy the past few months but things have finally started to die down. I miss alot of my friends from home I am going to try to visit home now that I have time to do so. It seems so weird when I come back to Trussville now. It just seems different. I have been away for so long. It is not like I hate college its just that I want to visit the few friends I have left from highschool. 

I love Ashlie so much. She has always been there for me. I am so lucky to have someone like her in my life.

Yeah this semester has been real rough. I have been so busy. From drum corps to pledging I have been busy for almost 6 months straight. I am so glad that I am actually going to have some free time now. I need to study more often. My grades have really suffered this semester. I have a 3.1 this semester but by the end of this semester I am hoping for a 2.5 . I have to maintain that average to keep my scholarship. But oh well I should  be fine.


HS,
Stan"

We go on tour in 5 days and our first show is in 6 days in one of the Carolinas. I cannot wait to leave to go on tour, Im sick of this hell or all days that they are putting us through right now. Im sure it will all pay off at the end of the season because Im sure we will be in finals this year. DCI finals will be shown on ESPN 2 this year so look for us on TV in second week of August. Well rehearsal starts in about 30 min. so im going to rest for a little while."

Alot of things have changed in the week or so. My hair currently looks like Ringo from the Beatles rather than Zac from Hanson. I guess it is a good change people say it looks good. I will miss my long hair but here lately it was just getting in the way. I have got 20 extra minutes to sleep in the morning because of this change and the powers that be in drum corps would rather me have shorter hair. 

Also, this past week has been great. I have got the girl ive been in love with ever since i have been in college. Ashlie Ross is the greatest girl ever and the feelings I have when im around her are indescribable. Everything right now is awesome the only thing that could go wrong will happen on April 18."

It  was a pretty good show for five dollars but when we first got there they tried to say it was a 21 and up show, we were like we came all the way from Jacksonville and they said it was ok. Good times ensued, we got doughnuts, ate pizza and saw a show and ended back in Jacksonville by 2:00 am......but yeah I had my piano and Aural Skills exam today and i made an A on both of them so im quite happy...

Im hating music theory right now, we are doing chord inversions and it doesnt make a goddamn bit of sense. Other than that the past few days have been cool. I got to march in the Georgia Dome where the falcons play this weekend so that was cool. We got to stay overnight in ATL so i got rather drunk that night. when we were drunk we broke went all the way to the roof of the hotel which was 25 stories high, we had to break the door in but the door had already been tampered with so it was real easy to get in, good times ensued.but yeah there is only one more exhitbition that we have and thats this weekend and then we only have to march for the games...which sorta sucks because we have a good football team this year and they are going to the playoffs, oh well its been a good season i just cant wait until its over so i can finally have some free time i havent been home in forever but me and andrew are finally going to go home this weekend after our exhibition to goto some guys halloween party so that will be cool but yeah thats all i got to say so...later"

"event","yeah i havent made a entry in a while, nor sober for that matter....college is great right now for the most part it gets quite stressful though...my music classes seem to be the hardest right now. Music theory is a kick to the balls just because it takes me so long to learn the intervals and the transpostion thing but ill get it eventually, and Aural skills pisses me of because im not to good at learning to sightsing and read rythyms, and as most of you know im white and i have some trouble with rhythyms....but i guess all this music stuff will be worth it in the end because it seems like music is the only thing that keeps me going at times. Being in the southerners right now is getting quite tiring because we always have exhibitions all over georgia and i never have enough time to study for anything....speaking of studying i think im going to lock myself in the music building until they close it at 11, i need to alot of practicing and studying because if not i will end up in the lobby of the dorms until the early hours of the morning."

The people there are so awesome too they care so much about the band and is almost ridiculous how awesome we have become in just the first week, but everyone says we still need to step up ad get alot better....if we were ever that good in a week at hewitt the apocalypse we be happening because people at HT never cared enough....but oh yeah i play a 20-J (tuba) which weighs around 52 pounds and the give us a shitty strap for carrying it so my collar bone feels like it is going to break everyday and I have a bruise on my side from carrying it....and since Im a rookie 20-j (tuba) player that means im a toad and they give me a nickname with a little initation, well my nickname is Hanson, as in those fags that sang MMMbop.....oh well it couldve been worse,Ben Nichols nickname is the Pickle Tickler....but all in all ive had a good time.....There has been partys everynight and ive had the chance to get beer and anything else i want but i choose not too sometimes because i could toally not work in marching pratice while being hungover....but yeah im going back to JSU tonight i just wanted to update and tell everyone what ive been doing while im gone.........."

Even though some things are better left unsaid
There's a few things I need to get off my chest
I need to vent - let me tell you why 

I'm suicidal, maniacal, self-destructive
You leave me no hope, no life
Nothing worth living for
I've taken it, can't take it anymore
My worst nightmare
You make me want to slit my own fucking throat
Just so I'll be rid of you
Just to get rid of you 

You self-righteous fuck
Give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
Why don't you take a good look in these eyes
Cause I'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart
out
My hate is contagious; you've got no one to run to
EXILE 

Just tell me fucking why everything becomes an issue
Your opinion is always senseless - fuck this
You make my fucking skin crawl
I've lived with it - can't stand anymore
My worst nightmare
I want to take a bullet in the fucking head
Every time I think of you, every time I think of you 

You self-righteous fuck
Give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
Why don't you take a good look in these eyes
Cause I'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart
out
My hate is contagious
Anyone else need to vent?
You've tried my tolerance; I just want you to die 

There's nothing more for me to say
There's nothing more for you to say
There's nothing more for us to say
I fucking hate you anyway
EXILE 

Can't count the ways that you light my fuckin fuse
I can't tolerate the sight of you, the thought of you or
anything about you
You know what I want to see?
How many ways can a loser fucking lose
I know you'll find a way
The humility awakening the idiot inside
You spineless fucking maggot - you're just wasting my
time
Get out of my face - Get out of my life
Out of my fucking way - Just die

"event","yeah this morning i was going down clay trussville road going to the highschool and some clay chalkville fuckboy pulls out in front of me when i had he green light! am i mistaken but isnt he supposed to yield to me? i believe so. Everyone was ok but my right headlight is busted yet it still seems to work. His car is a bit worse than mine the metal on his car is pinching his back right tire and it wouldnt move. Oh well he deserves it for pulling out in front of me. I tried to dodge him but if i kept going any further to the left i wouldve had a head on collision with someone else...And some girl in his car even said ""you sped up when you saw us!!"" and i was like ""why would i speed up? to make even more damage?"" what a dumb little 9th grader she has no clue how to drive much less did she have the right to tell me what i did wrong especially since i didnt even do so....Oh well fuck it their insurance will pay for it...."

"event","orlando was cool...though i got sick a few times i managed to have a good time...the hulk was the best rollercoaster ever, spiderman 3d ride was pretty good, dueling dragons was good....universal studios was pretty lame, islands of adventure kicked it in the balls. sypmhonic band performed well though we didnt win the overall contest but we won the parade and we won our class (though we had no competition)...there was a dance/social they had for all the band fags and me and jess cleared it out which was pretty easy....though it was hard to make a pit to rap music we still manges to do so...then some black guy came over and made it a dance contest and i felt like i was in the movie ""you got served"" so i backed on up out of that...then some security guard  douchebag told me and jess "" that we had to stop the violent shit,""...the trip was good but i missed melissa and the only other thing i had to complain about is that they didnt give us much time to sleep but the parks were pretty good so i couldnt complain.....all in all it wasnt that bad for my last spring trip with the band ...."

"event","<P>being catholic is so weird especially when you dont even believe what they say to you.i personally dont believe in catholicism but i guess you could say im catholic by heritage? me being very italian i guess i had no way of getting out of it so i had to goto church tonight because it being holy week.this stuff is so weird considering it doesnt make any sense to me.i mean i want to believe in some sort of higher being or god&nbsp;and what not but i just havent had it explained to me in a way that could logically understand it and catholcism or any form of christianity or any  religion just doesnt make any sense to me at all.oh well maybe one day i can believe in something but for now i guess i will be confused.but enough about religion....<BR><BR>man i hate drama and or theater. i dont know why but it just seems like the shittiest art form there is mainly because i dont see what is soo ""artsy"" about acting like you are someone else. maybe i hate it just because of the drama program at&nbsp;my school sucks because it just all the sudden became the ""cool"" thing to do and it makes me sick. maybe its just the play itself or possibly just the same people im tired of seeing on stage acting a fool....maybe one day i can appreciate it for a good art form but while im at hewitt i think i will just see it as a way to get out of class for a few hours.....i have plenty of friends&nbsp;hopefully they dont get offended because its not them,&nbsp;they just need to tell the people that <U>always</U> get the lead role to give it a break they arent as good as they think they are nor are they as funny...<BR><BR>yeah i was supposed to get my license today but it rained damnit so that means i have to wait all the way to next week to get it because i can only get it on my dads off day which happens to be thusrday, what sucks even more is that after the courthouse said they suspended the driving tests for today it got really sunny and then it was too late ...oh well...so i felt the need to be bitchy all day long.....i need to calm down...and there is only one right way to calm down and thats with my special friend cannabis.....</P>"

"event","Last night was cool. I got a little bit tipsy and everything was great then rachel gave me a pinch of some good which made my night even better. But other than all that junk it was a pretty interesting night. Jupiter Sunrise did Raining Blood and they did it very well....i wouldve liked to hear them to attempt the vocals. But nothing can beat me and chad doing ballroom dancing that was the greatest. Yeah I think I have an idea why gay people are gay now thanks to zac though i still understand how you cant be attracted to a girl...but anyways. the rowdiness was good but it seemed to get out of hand at times...i accidently hit laura hopefully she was ok, what really sucks though is that my hand went in some random persons mouth and that was kinda discusting but yeah it happens.....well im out.....

"event","So i go up to Jacksonville State (where im going next year) to hear their Chamber Winds and their Wind Ensemble. In the middle of the concert the director says he is going to recognize 2 highschool students in the audience that are being awarded FULL scholarship. So I start wondering who it could be and i was thinking it could be me considering i tried out for it. BUT no they say the last name i wanted to hear: Ben Nichols.....I felt like total shit for the rest of the concert because i thought i did good enough on my tryout to get a full scholarship but when i heard his name i wanted to throw up. So the concert ends I grab my balls and congratulate Ben and when im about to leave I see the director and he looks at me in shock and he said "" Oh my God if I wouldve known you were here i would mentioned your name too....You got a full scholarship"".......it was one of greatest moments ever.....im so happy"

"event","<p>Dear Ms. TNav,

I wish I could have a chance to tell you how much you meant to me. You&#39;re class was one of the few classes in high school I got excited about. I know I won&#39;t have minored in creative writing if it weren&#39;t for you. You gave me something to be passionate about, something to look forward to, a challenge. In your class I found my voice. I was shy, quite, and reserved but you helped me learn how to express myself through words. You gave me projects that were meaningful. In your class, I was the only sophmore. Why? Because, as always, when my advisor tried to force me into doing a five year plan I freaked out. I remember spending the whole class period overwhelmed because I didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do or who I wanted to me. When the time was up I started crying because there were too many options. My counsellor finally asked me which classes looked interesting. I told her creative writing and digital media. (I&#39;m crying now just thinking about how God has a sense of humor because here I am, Mass Communications (Videographer) Major and Creative Writing Minor when back then I had NO idea what I wanted to be. I still don&#39;t but I didn&#39;t realize how these decisions shaped my future.) Anyway, my councellor told me creative writing was only for Juniors and Seniors and I was to be a sophmore. I was so stressed and overwhelmed with these decisions so she told me she would take care of it and I wound up in your class. In your class I wrote a lot of dark, emo things because that was in back then but also because it was easy. I struggle with writing happy positive things. My college biology teacher made me write an essay on positive thinking because I was so negative years later when I went to her class. Anyway, you saw my writing as beautiful and you always gave back good constructive criticism. The poems and short stories I wrote for your class got me through university. I actually saw you when I interviewed mrs. edwards for mass comm paper. You seemed differen. I wish I would have stayed and talked to you longer or emailed you. Ms. TNav you were such a wonderful teacher. I admire you for all you put up with. The whole world has felt the echo of your loss just like Dwaynes. I think about you a lot and i&#39;m so sad you are no longer here. I wish you weren&#39;t gone. I remember when Nathan Fergeson took his life when I was a freshman. I didn&#39;t quite understand how dark the world actually is and how someone could do such a thing. The older I get the more I realise how easily one could fall into a depression. How our own thoughts can be twisted against us. How once someone goes into a negative spiral, without change, they could be driven mad. I just wish I could have provided you with some friendship or some words of hope. I wish someone would have. Your class was where I fell hard for a moron... a moron you thought was a moron no less. Stupid high school. Stupid high school and one of the best teachers I had is now gone. I wasn&#39;t even close to you , just a student, and here I am crying for you... You mean more to me than a facebook post so i can only imagine how your family feels. I think about you constantly. You, Dwayne, Brady, Nathan, Frankie, Leslie and everyone else gone too soon. &lt;3 Prayers of peace to your families. </p><p>This is for anyone reading this even though it&#39;s directed towards girls. YOU MATTER &lt;3 </p><lj-embed id=""93""/>"

"event","Happy 2016! Around this time of the year people start making goals about how they want to change their lives for the better. Around this year in 2014, I did some soul searching myself. What did I want to do with my life? I knew that I had graduated from college about six months earlier and, even though my job was directly in my major, I wasn&#39;t happy with it. I didn&#39;t like the routine, the traffic, nor the job itself. Honestly, I just wasn&#39;t ready to jump into living like an adult. It wasn&#39;t how I pictured my life to be at all. I decided to try to change my life and make it the way I wanted it to be.

I knew one thing I missed that I had taken for granted was school. I&#39;d been in school my whole life, striving for A&#39;s and I didn&#39;t know anything different. Unfortunately, I was in school for the A&#39;s not the actual learning part. I wanted to become a videographer for many reasons. I thought it would keep me out of the office, keep me fit, and keep me inspired. I did everything I could to make A&#39;s in all my classes but it wasn&#39;t until i graduated that I learned grades were useless if nothing you memorized to pass a test &quot;stuck&quot;. I began to look up places where I could get a free education. That&#39;s where I found Creativelive. I went there for photoshop classes but I clicked on the Travel Budgeting video instead. There Nomadic Matt was talking about how cheap traveling was and how anyone could do it. The more I listened, the more I believed that I could go. All I could think about was the last time I studied abroad. Everyone kept telling me to enjoy it because I may never be able to go back. My life was lacking adventure and inspiration. After listening to Nomadic Matt, I started digging online for more information."

"event","<p>This is probably the single most beautiful thing I&#39;ve read today. It&#39;s a description by someone oh how they felt working a 9 to 5. The moment they knew they wanted to travel...

&quot;I suddenly realized I knew exactly what my life would be like for the next 15 years. Well paid, good people, somewhat engaging - and completely, utterly predicable. Get up, work hard, go home, collapse; the most vicious of cycles.<i> A raging storm in a cup as the rest of the world turned on by. </i>I looked outside at the landscape and remembered many an episode of National Geographic.

Screw this. It suddenly became very obvious want I wanted.

A bit over a year later - I&#39;m traveling. I have no idea what tomorrow will bring. Carpe Diem baby.&quot;

I absolutely love this!</p><p></p><p>Also I got this as feedback for my au pair position.</p><p>&quot;Gracias Katherine, ante todo me gusta tu sinceridad.
Mucha suerte en la b&uacute;squeda de tu familia.&quot;</p><p>Which translates to:</p>

"event","<p>It&#39;s rough planning this trip. There are so many doubts and doubters. I&#39;ve managed to cut a few friends who I&#39;ve realized have always been negative people in my life. It&#39;s a scary thing to leave the people you love to venture out into the unknown. I still hold to a lot of people all over the world travel all the time, everywhere. When I went to Italy with only one friend, I never felt threatened. Did people try to take advantage of the fact that I was a tourist? Yes, however I never felt that I was in danger.</p><p>They say taking the leap is the most difficult part. Finding a host family has been more difficult that expected. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s me not wanting to commit or if it&#39;s them. I get so many applications and now they are wanting to skype call me to see if we would be a good match. It&#39;s a great idea and I totally want to do it, however, this weekend I skipped my first interview. I blame it on many things: Sleeping in, signs of a cold about to begin, crappy laptop, no decent areas for background... but maybe it&#39;s cold feet.</p><p>I&#39;ve been planning this for over a year now. The advice given to me from multiple sources was, you can&#39;t wait or you&#39;ll loose momentum. Just do it. and I think that&#39;s what happened. It&#39;s like doubt, fear, and naysayers have slowed me down.</p><p>I need to get it together. My friend recently told me that I needed to write out who I was and what I stand for so I can be who I want to be. I think that will be my next step. This weekend coming I have another Skype interview.</p><p>My plan is to au pair, learn spanish, explore, and hopefully be able to intern at a news station so I don&#39;t loose experience. We&#39;ll see how it goes.</p><p>I wrote a letter to myself last year in my agenda for this year. It said, &quot;I hope you are still planning your trip. Remember, if not now, when?&quot; So I&#39;ve vocalized to everyone that I want to do it and I&#39;m planning to do it, I&#39;ve cut out the downers, I&#39;ve researched... it&#39;s time to start putting action my plans and not get lazy. I need to commit because this is what I want to do.</p><p>If not I need to start looking for a better job because this one is like sitting in stagnant water. I&#39;m not going anywhere. Instead im sinking and turning into mud. I&#39;m becoming lazy and accepting of things that I should not accept. I am a strong believer in Socrates quote,&quot;The unexamined life is not worth living.&quot;</p>"

"event","in the grand scheme of things, i cannot for the life of me finish a blog entry. I think up many admireable things while im driving, convenently without paper or pens or anyway to safely jot them down. The thoughts that happen to make it onto the blog NEVER get finished and it&#39;s truely unacceptable.
Today is November 29, 2014 and this blog entry shall be submitted tonight, finished or not.
It&#39;s been an hour since i wrote the previous statements above. Since then I have been on facebook (Mainly), skype and I have checked my email. Then it hit me:

I was thinking about my thanksgiving weekend and how it was spend. Thus far I have had a lovely thanksgiving dinner with my family and shared a Squanto day with my dearest friends. I experienced being in public on a Black Friday and I am here to tell the story because Black Friday is not as dangerous as I was taught it might be.&nbsp; I have wasted uncountable hours on the internet and watching tv. I have declined most social activities I was invited to which is unfortunate as I would like to become more social. The delema is I dislike spending money... So if I have spent time with you this holiday consider yourself on of my closest friends.

On that note, I&#39;d just like to express how thankful I am for my friends.I only have a few close friends and I am very grateful for them. I love how different they are and how they keep in touch with me and dont just wait for me to keep in touch with them. I love how unique they are. I wish I could tell them everything I feel about them when I am around them but it just never seems to happen. You are special to me. You are some of the most creative people I know and hold so much potential. I hope the world can appreciate you!"

"event","This Saturday I went to a lower income neighborhood to help host a &quot;block party&quot; with the Serve Team. I found out about the event via facebook. I thought we were just handing out backpacks to children with school supplies. This was my first time serving without my friend Alex or without a friend in general. I just showed up in my red serve shirt, a little late as always. I asked to car pool with someone because I don&#39;t see the point of taking 100 vehicles. The girl who offered to drive me was a new christian I discovered on the way there. She, like many others, had missed out on their Hillsong concert tickets. Being one of those ticket less fans, felt her pain as we listened to Jesus Culture. I learned about her testimony and how she overcame drugs, being gay, and out of shape. Her life was totally transformed and she gave all the glory to God. Though she still struggles in a few areas, she knows that there is power in the name of Jesus. Lesson learned: always chose to carpool.

When we got to this broken down neighborhood we started unpacking tables, chairs, a grill, and food. I watched as the scene unfolded in front of me. An ordinary parking lot was turned into a place for families to come and eat. The hotdogs were on the grill as we organized food into categories: chips, cookies, hotdog buns, candy. At the end of the line we had free bibles. While I was standing around waiting for paper towels and gloves I felt something on my leg. My first instinct was to shake it off but when I looked down I saw a little boy no taller than my knee hugging my leg. Not quite knowing what to do, I stared at him and smiled. He looked back at me with his brown skin shining in the sun and black hair hanging just over his eyes. He smiled back, laughed, and ran off. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s ever happened before.

Finally everything was ready. Hotdogs cooked, facing painting area established, games brainstormed and an assembly line made for the food. Someone backed their vehicle in the shade and turned on some christian music. We saw people walking by and invited them to come eat and to tell their friends. The first guy who came only spoke Spanish. I wish I was one of the few people who could speak Spanish there. He seemed happy for the food. I gave him some chips and cookies while he dressed his hot dog. I gestured toward the stack of Bibles to see if he wanted one. &quot;Spanish?&quot; he asked. I looked through them and they were all in English. My heart sank as I replied, &quot;lo siento, no espanol.&quot; He nodded and ate his hotdog. This is why I need to know another language. I want to connect with other cultures. I want to be able to understand them and hold a conversation without a translator.

The next lady who came was thanking God constantly and would add, &quot;I only think about them children, you see?&quot; &quot;Thank God for yall!&quot; &quot;Yall need some mayo packets. I like mayo on my hotdog but ketchup will do.&quot; She was an outgoing individual. &quot;God bless yall!&quot;

After her, everything seemed to pick up pace. So many faces passed through, many of them children. I let them pick out the chips they wanted and gave them cookies. The younger ones constantly came back for candy. &quot;Which type of candy do you want?&quot; I would ask them. &quot;Red&quot; one girl shyly replied. Panicked I looked into the bucket, &quot;Kit Kat?&quot; She shook her head no. Even more panicked because that was the only red candy I saw in the bucket, I picked up some M&amp;M&#39;s. She smiled and reached for them. &quot;That&#39;s not red! That&#39;s brown!&quot; I told her while handing them to her. &quot;Nah uh!&quot; she replied laughing and walked off. &quot;Uh huh!&quot; I retorted.

The day continued. Many people seemed glad to be there, others not so much. At the end, one of the older men told the community why we were there and that we would be there every fourth Saturday. We prayed over them and started raffling off backpacks to the little kids. The girl that gave me a ride shared her testimony with the people. Then we handed out Walmart bags full of groceries to the people. I saw the little boy that hugged my leg playing in the water bucket. He was taking ice, sucking on it, then spitting it out. I picked him up and brought him to my table. Having worked at Mc Donald&#39;s, I know ice isn&#39;t the most sanitary thing. &quot; I am thirsty.&quot; He mumbled... I was shocked that he knew how to talk. I brought him some water to drink. &quot;I want to touch the ice.&quot; he said. I told him he couldn&#39;t because the ice was dirty. I picked him up and asked him where his mom was. Turns out, she was one of the Serve Team Leaders and looked busy. I took him to the side and sat on the ground with him. He played with the water bottle then came and sat close to me like my dog does. Someone passing by asked if he was mine. I heavily shook my head no. WHYYYYYY lol I am too young to be asked that question lol probably not though ugh.

When everything was packed up, we got in a group and prayed again. We prayed for one woman who revealed that she was HIV positive. I am not going to lie, I was terrified. Had I touched her? Do I have open wounds? I bite my nails until they bleed...But I remembered that God doesn&#39;t give us a spirit of fear, He gives us a spirit of hope. Fear comes from the devil. God will protect His people. It felt like I was walking on water for a moment, then sinking, but then I turned my eyes back to God and was walking on water again. Instantly I was comforted.

The little boys older brother took him. They were thirteen years apart. Turns out the little boy was three... I didn&#39;t know three year olds could talk and understand! My mind was blown.

That day I also met a young couple who were serving with me. They were so cute, both went to Southeastern, both had masters degrees, and both loved God and were so happy to give. I cannot wait to have that one day!"

"event","I feel like I have so much potential but I just can&#39;t seem to reach even a fraction of it. They describe depression like an onion with layers of darkness surrounding the person. The person feels like there is no hope and sinks deeper into the dark pit... I am sure we have all battled some form of depression. I am not depressed but the struggle is real. I can see my life the way I want it to be. It&#39;s like looking into the night sky and being able to touch the stars... you can breathe in the fresh air and stretch your hands up into the darkness and touch one of the tiny balls of fire. I see myself.

I have it all together. I cash my checks every Friday and my check book gets balanced monthly. I live in a lovely apartment, it&#39;s not too big but spacy and everything is where it belongs. No mess, bed made, dishes washed and fridge freshly stocked with fresh fruits, veggies and healthy foods. I go onto the balcony and water my beautiful plants before I go and workout. My apartment is filled with natural light, books, plants, and music. I work out daily and am constantly trying to learn new things. I have a tumbler account full of my own photography and poetry. I read the bible and pray daily. I make decent money and enjoy my job...

Even though I cannot touch the stars, I feel like the above is not an impossible task. So I believe with all my heart it can happen... of course hopefully after I travel.

I just feel like the 9 to 5 life isn&#39;t for me. 8 hours a day forty hours a week.. who came up with that anyway?"

"event","<p>The purpose of my visit to the mall was bridesmaid dress shopping with the bride to be... my cousin. I was already running late because I decided to get fuel and buy a bag of chips at WalMart. Keep in mind that I am comparing chip prices and brands to try to get the better deal... adding time to my already late departure.</p><p></p><p>I get to the mall and park in an unfamiliar area. I enter the mall through Dillard&#39;s instead of&nbsp; my normal JcPenny&#39;s entrance. It makes a difference! By now I am getting &quot;where are you?&quot; texts. They are at Forever21, so I find my way out of&nbsp; Dillard&#39;s and hasten my pace. I look for signs to get me to where I need to go. I pass through crowds of people, making turns, and follow signs to get me to my destination.</p><p></p><p>Out of no where, this young woman from a booth in the middle of the aisle walks out to me. I do the usual, avoid eye contact and say not interested. I am not sure how it happened; was it her long wavy hair or the stud bolt she had pierced under her eye that broke my resistance. She asked to see my nails. I stopped and showed them to her sure that she would loose interest. She grabbed my hand to get closer look. &quot;Oh you bite them!&quot; Her accent was unlike any I&#39;d heard before. I was intrigued. She started filing my nails with this thing and was talking to me. I don&#39;t even know what she was saying. Finally I came back to reality... &quot;three two one...&quot; She removed the file buffer thing and showed my nail, shiny, below it. &quot;Nice? huh? Beautiful, right?&quot;</p><p></p><p>I nod politely and take it as my chance to escape. &quot;Smell this. Good, no?&quot; I give her a look like she is crazy. &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid it&#39;s just a scent. Which one you like best?&quot; I told her I liked the Ocean Scent one ignoring my better judgement. &quot;Ah, yes, it smells clean. Think of someone, anyone. Do you know anyone who would like this?&quot; I thought about my cousins and how they were waiting me. &quot;Mother, sister, aunt...&quot; &quot;Cousin&quot; I say unwillingly. &quot;Ah! Cousin, ok, guess what?&quot; She reached under the table and brought out another little package... wasn&#39;t even sure of what. &quot;Guess how much this cost? Go on guess.&quot; I wanted to be lik<i>e buy one get one free </i>but I didn&#39;t want to offend her. &quot;Free. Buy this one and I&#39;ll give it to you for free... for your cousin. It&#39;s only fifty dollars.&quot; She looks at me with pleading eyes. I feel myself handing her my debit card... Like I have nothing better to spend my money on... like a new laptop or BIBLE! But here I am signing my name on the electronic device in front of me.</p><p></p><p>I feel overwhelmed and dizzy, like <i>what just happened here?</i></p><p>&quot;Come, let me treat you to a hand massage.&quot; She pulls me inside her booth thing. I am thinking <i>How much time has gone by? Where are my cousins?</i> She starts telling me about the product and I ask her where she is from. I learned that she is from Israel, 22, traveling the world, and has served in the military. Apparently, everyone must serve in the military at the age of 18. Both male and female! She is trying to earn money so that she may travel South America.</p><p></p><p>She smears mud on my arm while I scrub my hands with salt. She tells me about the Dead Sea and how people come from all over the world for its resources. There is no sand to walk on, it&#39;s all salt and it heals skin. She tells me that I should visit Israel. &quot;Isn&#39;t is dangerous?&quot; I ask her trying not to offend her. &quot;Everywhere is dangerous.&quot; She smiles.</p><p></p><p>Everywhere <i>is</i> dangerous. I know this, however, it&#39;s been ingrained into my mind since birth that it is unsafe outside the country and that it&#39;s not wise to travel. I used to think this was my family&#39;s way of thinking but now I lean towards the fact that it&#39;s how most Americans think.</p><p></p><p>She starts to telling me how this little boy got captured by the Pakistan&#39;s (or some other religious group) and she is hoping that Obama will step in a save him. I want to tell her not to count on it. Obama has probably been giving Israel&#39;s enemies weapons... but I could be wrong. I am not educated enough on the subject. I do know that the Bible talks a lot about the nations turning their backs to Israel during the end times and that makes me shudder. </p><p></p><p>She then pours water onto my hands and washes the salt off. My hands feel smooth and weird. &quot;Why do my hands feel that way?&quot; I ask her as she flips through pictures of the Dead Sea. &quot;Because it takes off the dead skin&quot; she replies and then tells me about the mud smeared on my arm. She washes it off and starts to pinch my skin together. &quot;See how your skin is tight here but on the your other arm, when I apply the same amount of pressure, you get no wrinkles?&quot; I wish I didn&#39;t see what she was saying, but I did. She starts names off prices to things. I don&#39;t even know what they are and the way she throws around one eighty, like $1.80 when it&#39;s $180, is foreign to me especially for one item. She notices my eyes bulge and panic set in. She knows I am about to come out of the cloud she somehow engulfed me in. I laughed, &quot;That&#39;s too much! There is no way I could afford that!&quot; &quot;Too much for the budget? Hold on.&quot; She walks to the computer and starts typing things in. I am thinking I am off the hook but now I feel like an animal in a cage, except it&#39;s disguised as a comfortable home with friendly people. She walks towards me and grins a little &quot;Okay, you can&#39;t tell anyone about this... pinky swear.&quot; She holds out her pinky finger like we&#39;ve been friends since kindergarten. I found myself pinky swearing even though I haven&#39;t done it in a while. &quot;I will use my employee discount and still give you the free gift that comes with it. So you can have <i>all</i> of this for one eighty instead of just this item. Sound good?&quot; I hand her my card.... why? I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s an out of body experience. Apparently it shows on my face. &quot;C&#39;mon. Smile! It&#39;s okay to spoil yourself every now and then. The price really isn&#39;t bad because these products last for a year!&quot;</p><p></p><p>She hands me a weighty bag and smiles as I drift back into the mall. I am dazed... <i>where am I going? Cousins... find family!!</i> As I return to my search for Forever 21 I see familiar faces. My cousins were going into Love Culture. I run to them. &quot;Are you alright? Where were you?&quot; They asked. &quot;I&#39;ve been... taken advantage of... financially! I just bought like $280 of crap. Quick escort me back to my vehicle! Clearly I cannot trust myself! And whatever you do avoid eye contact with everyone!&quot; </p><p></p><p>Lessons learned:
A) The I need to become more like that sales girl. Bold, confident, and carefree.</p><p>B) I need to visit Israel</p><p>C) The whole world is dangerous</p><p>D) Maybe I needed to spend the money 1. She may have <i>really</i> needed the commission and 2. I need to to learn to let go of money. </p><p>E) I have &quot;big pores&quot; haha So if anything hopefully it will work.</p><p>F) DON&#39;T DO IT AGAIN especially if going abroad. ugh</p><p></p><p>Also my friend Alex said I was &quot;thirst trapped&quot; haha</p><p></p>"

<p>I wonder if one ever gets over an accident. It doesn&#39;t effect everyday life so much as it does the simple little things. I tense up&nbsp; when I use cruise control or take a sharp turn. I grip the steering wheel&nbsp;slightly too hard when it rains and if I have to slam the brakes quickly. I notice when other cars get too close to my lane. Sometimes I shudder thinking about spinning out of control.</p><p></p><p>When I was a kid I loved racing on go carts. My family used to travel the country frequently and everywhere we went I&#39;d get to&nbsp;race the go carts. I&#39;d been on all sorts of tracks simple ones, ones that looped into the air, and some that twirled up stories high. I think I was in Colorado racing on a simple stretched circle track. That was when I got over confident. I felt I was going too fast and if I just scraped against the tire wall, outlining the inside of the circle, I would slow down a bit... because you know hitting the brake would be too easy. I must have gotten the idea from playing racing video games. When your car hits the grass median or slightly touches the wall it would slow the vehicle down... it&#39;s really the only way i can justify those thoughts. However, flying down the track at full speed and then barely&nbsp; touching the tire median causes a different reaction than I expected as a child. It completely stopped my go cart and I spun out control. If it hadn&#39;t been for my seat belt I would of had more than a huge gash in my neck. I would have been most likely thrown out of my go cart and probably would have gotten ran over. Even though I was able to get back into my go cart and finish the race I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been go cart riding much since then.</p><p></p><p>When I hydroplaned and spun out of control in the company car I remember the mud covering the windshield where I couldn&#39;t see what was going on or where I would end up. I remember trying to brace myself for when the car flipped over and thinking &quot;whelp I&#39;m it&#39;s passenger now.&quot; I slammed on the brakes because it was the only thing I could do to feel in control... even though that made it worse probably. It wasn&#39;t even a &quot;Jesus take the wheel&quot; moment. It was peaceful and slow motion like I knew I&#39;d be ok even though I was thinking the outcome would be far worst.</p><p></p><p>When I was really young my cousin and I both sat on a swing in my grandparents yard. It was a huge swing, each leg hurdled over concert. We would start swinging by pushing it as far back as our legs could reach and then lift our legs up of the ground and ride it forward. then we&#39;d pump our legs in sync trying to get it to reach the sky. We heard a noise and then floated to the ground. The noise was the arch and legs falling around us as we drifted back to earth. We looked around and then looked at each other. How did we not feel anything? Why didn&#39;t we get hurt? It was one of those moments.</p><p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: center; clear: both;""><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-54QWbS9oOcU/U0q4O7B1sTI/AAAAAAAAALE/gXYTpQJe77Q/s1600/tumblr_ltc0hlqPi71qlccb8o1_500.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-right: 1em; margin-left: 1em;""><img border=""0"" data-orig-src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-54QWbS9oOcU/U0q4O7B1sTI/AAAAAAAAALE/gXYTpQJe77Q/s1600/tumblr_ltc0hlqPi71qlccb8o1_500.jpg"" height=""174"" src=""https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-54QWbS9oOcU%2FU0q4O7B1sTI%2FAAAAAAAAALE%2FgXYTpQJe77Q%2Fs1600%2Ftumblr_ltc0hlqPi71qlccb8o1_500.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*"" tabindex=""-1"" width=""320"" /></a></p><p></p><p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: center; clear: both;""><a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NS-toGsoCCc/U0q4b_PCrYI/AAAAAAAAALM/HtJnutAHjLo/s1600/tumblr_mj1lxeXcol1qfdmiho1_1280.jpg"" imageanchor=""1"" style=""margin-right: 1em; margin-left: 1em;""><img border=""0"" data-orig-src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NS-toGsoCCc/U0q4b_PCrYI/AAAAAAAAALM/HtJnutAHjLo/s1600/tumblr_mj1lxeXcol1qfdmiho1_1280.jpg"" height=""212"" src=""https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-NS-toGsoCCc%2FU0q4b_PCrYI%2FAAAAAAAAALM%2FHtJnutAHjLo%2Fs1600%2Ftumblr_mj1lxeXcol1qfdmiho1_1280.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*"" tabindex=""-1"" width=""320"" /></a><br type=""_moz"" />

This song is nostalgic to me. I remember listening to it the summer I made the transition between the community college I went to after I graduated from high school and moving to Southeastern to begin the rest of my college career. That summer was full of the unknown for me. I had never lived away from my hometown and had no idea what to expect. I was sad to be leaving everything I had grown up to know as familiar and home. That summer was full of excitement because I took a single class at Southeastern and was commuting there and back five days a week with my cousin to get a feel for the campus. We would take turns driving there. She had been going there for two years and I was happy to reconnect with her. We hadn&#39;t really been close since before school started when we were kids. The days were hot, breezy, and beautiful. The campus was mainly empty and peaceful. I would take my four to five hour history class then stroll around campus trying to take everything in.</p><p>The statues by the art building and the squirrels that danced around it. The huge library, that had lions protecting its entrance and dark reflective windows.&nbsp; When the doors would slide open the air conditioned breeze would play with your hair as you strolled in. Everything was entirely new to me, including the freedom. The chance to do whatever I wanted to do without permission. I could walk wherever I wanted to without letting someone know. It was beautiful. Being independent is a magnificent thing, and so is learning. I had no idea what to expect. I was afraid I wouldn&#39;t be good enough to be successful in my classes since I made a low score on my ACT. I was terrified I wouldn&#39;t make friends because I was shy and kind of a wall flower. I prayed that I would get a good roommate when I moved into my dorm in the fall. I didn&#39;t think I could be away from my parents for a week and survive. I had never been away from my family, ever.</p><p>When my cousin would drop me off at home I would put Nickelodeon on the TV and try to remain a kid for as long as life would allow me to. I spent a lot of my carefree summer watching Victorious and iCarly. I had never watched child shows such as these before because they were frowned upon by my parents but for some reason they gave my comfort. This promo such out to me that summer that forever changed my life. I didn&#39;t know then that I would make friends, be successful, fall in love, become an Resident Assistant, actually declare a major, spend a summer in Spain, graduate with honors, love sushi, watch the stars on the roof tops of buildings, take late night walks with friends, and get a job in my field a month after graduation...</p><p>That summer I got close to my cousin and her friends, learned the campus, talked to strangers, explored, passed my class with an A (which I worked hard for), and drove more than I ever had (actually got lost once on the way back that turned my hour commute to three hours!).</p><p>It&#39;s weird thinking that was only three years ago. It feels like forever ago and just yesterday at the same time. I&#39;ve had a blast and I cannot wait for what the future holds! My cousin got engaged recently. I am excited for her! Something about that song brings the memories back to me. I was the quiet scared girl without a voice who didn&#39;t want to grow up....</p><p>Also, I love the way this music video was shot, it&#39;s a very creative promo... however I never did watch degrassi haha</p>"

"event","<p>It&#39;s funny how things work sometimes. I go on an outreach to help people outside my church. I expect to be outside washing cars and vacuuming, manual labor out in the sun. Some how I get &quot;stuck&quot; inside&nbsp;in charge of the food&nbsp;table with two older women. I didn&#39;t want to be inside but I definitely don&#39;t want to be in the kids area or giving manicures (as if I could if I wanted to)...</p><p>Even though it wasn&#39;t how I&nbsp;envisioned&nbsp;my Saturday going, I actually had a great time. I made new friends and I feel like I made a difference in the women&#39;s lives who we were trying to help. The most surprising part was when one of the older ladies&nbsp;I was volunteering with came up to me and thanked me for being me. She said that she took me as a sign from God to keep volunteering and going to church. She said she was so afraid she wouldn&#39;t connect with anyone.</p><p>God put me right where He wanted me to be. I wanted to have fun in the sun and get a workout but instead I encouraged another volunteer to keep going. I told the woman I felt the same way because I went by myself too. In fact I almost didn&#39;t go for the same reasons. However, I really wanted to go though regardless of the fear I had. My saying this year is &quot;Why not? and If not now when?</p><p>God&#39;s plan always amazes me. It makes me smile when I can look back on my life and see how He has clearly directed me every step of the way without me knowing it. I struggled... but why? God&#39;s got my back.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson

He is new to this whole being around people thing. He forces himself to make conversation because what does he have to loose? He dared himself to come and he has already revealed his sins, not that it isn&#39;t obvious. The twitch he carries is a constant reminder of what he craves for. He tries to impress the people around him but he is on a sinking ship and this is his last straw before he gives up the battle. The tattoos around his neck are scars from the past and the symbols on his fingers hold unknown secrets. He knows the dirty side to society, the one that lingers in the shadows and tries to draw people in. They drew him in like a moth to a light and caught him like a bug in a web but he escaped his fate like so few can. Speaking of bugs, this innocent child hums in his ear like a mosquito. He swats her gently away but she won&#39;t leave. She knows not the struggle that awaits her in the future. She will have her own inner demons to kill as well as outer conflicts. Right now she is ok that her skin is not the same as her mothers but he knows she will have a difficult civil war ahead of her. The more he swats her away, the more determined she is to come back more powerful than ever. He grinds his uneven teeth and crosses his fingers praying for patience. At any moment he could revert to the animal he once had to be, protecting his plate with both arms and snapping at hands with his teeth. He must be strong; the twitch cannot win, for if he gives in again he may not live to be sober again.

Get out of bed, make a hot drink and go outside. You owe yourself that much. Maybe you still cry in far too many public bathrooms, but I swear, you stay a few seconds less every time. Smile at strangers if it&rsquo;s all you can do, know that life doesn&rsquo;t start when the sun rises or the credits roll but when you decide it&rsquo;s time to go after what you deserve, and you deserve everything because we are alive both only once and a million times every day and every minute is something new to learn and someone new to love, and if it all crashes and burns as it so often does cling on to hope through it all and don&rsquo;t ever ever ever let it go. Start your life again whenever you need to. Repeat after me: it is not yet the end. It is not yet the end. It is not yet the end.

Compassion hurts. When you feel connected to everything, you also feel responsible for everything. And you cannot turn away. Your destiny is bound with the destinies of others. You must either learn to carry the universe or be crushed by it. You must grow strong enough to love the world, yet empty enough to sit down at the same table with its worst horrors.</p><p class=""source"">- Andrew Boyd </p><p class=""source""></p><p class=""source"">She looks at me for a moment, her eyes filled with wisdom. She says, &quot;Well, you are pretty.&quot; The first sentence I have been able to understand out of our lengthy conversation. She looks down at the seatbelt holding her into the seat. Sometimes it protects her like a hug, other times it is like a leash keeping her from freedom. She looks up and her eyes have returned innocent and distant. She mumbles about her seatbelt and asks if it is working, picking at the buckle. Her long white hair cascades neatly to her waist like chevrons on a uniform informing the world of her rank in&nbsp;life. She looks deeply into my eyes, for her conversation is real and&nbsp; her words make sense to her. When she finishes her sentence she smiles and awaits a response. I smile at her and nod which seems to suffice. She continues with her conversation. For some reason, I know she knows I cannot understand her. I know that she knows her language, which is a mix of the past and present, is foreign which maybe why she starts to mumble. On the inside is an intelligent&nbsp;woman just trying to escape. She looks intently at me as I smile and&nbsp;nod again. She knows the words, she knows her thoughts but she cannot make them&nbsp;communicate what she wants them to.&nbsp;She is rolled backwards mid sentence by a nurse. The spell is broken.&nbsp;When I look at the nurse she states that it is lunch time and&nbsp;wheels the elderly woman to&nbsp;a table.&nbsp;The elderly woman still talking to me though I am no longer in her&nbsp;view.&nbsp;The nurse puts food in front the woman. I walk&nbsp;in front the woman&nbsp;and smile.&nbsp;&quot;The others get better food,&quot; she whispers to me as she smirks, eyes full of knowledge.&nbsp;I tell her it smells good, even though it looks like baby food.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, her eyes turn distant and she starts searching for something on her plate. She finds the receipt and points to it mumbling. I tell her I have to go so she can eat before her food gets cold. She keeps mumbling but this time to herself. She no longer sees me as I wave goodbye.</p><p class=""source""></p><p class=""source"">I know she knows what is going on. I know she knows I am there to visit her.

Eventually I adopted a new family but as I grew comfortable with my surroundings, my time was up. I left many things unsaid but hopefully the memories shared were enough and long lasting. When returning to my original family, I was no longer the same person I was when I left. I had changed almost completely so I started yet another quest. The quest to belong where I once felt at home... however now I realize that I didn&#39;t fit in at home. Not completely. I only felt the need to call it home because it was all I knew but know I know there is more out there. My second home, though temporary, was more personalized. Trying to personalize my original home causes friction. Slowly I am putting down roots... but shallow roots because deep down, I know this is not my own home.

but I never thought it could be a reality so I aimed lower.
Recently I have been struck with this crazy notion that I can travel the world.
I think I have found someone who will go with me!!
My life!
Why do I want to travel the world?
Why not?
I want to see it and meet the people within it.
I want to live like no one else
and see all there is to see!
Why can&#39;t I be an adventurer?
I am terrified but very excited!
I know once I start, everything will work out.
I just have to start.
A journey of a thousand miles starts with one step.
I need to take that step/ leap of faith.
I REALLY want to do this! I haven&#39;t felt this strongly about something
in a long time."

Restrained conflict lands on

Nothing reflects on the dull
Nothing echos in the shallow.
Gold is merely a metal.

It&#39;s easier to be angry and fearful

No matter which direction the wind blows.
Heavier than lead, softer than iron

And if I had known then

"event","Driving to Monroe for business...
Three and a half hours there
Three and a half hours back.
Leave Saturday afternoon, meet reporter, set up, get interview with Edwin Edwards, Buddy Roemer, Jay Dardenne, Francis Thompson, and other politicians pre roast, set up, shoot roast, shoot last minute interviews, go to hotel.
Leave Sunday morning, get to office around 2 pm, unload and go home.
Pretty cookie cutter, right?
WRONG!!!
The drive to Monroe was pretty normal. It was a beautiful day with no traffic and a full tank of gas. Driving through Mississippi, I was wondering why it has nicer roads than Louisiana. The road quality changes literally as you cross the state line. We are talking not just zero pot holes but actual &quot;smoothness,&quot; like cruising on black ice. Honestly, I have no idea why there are nice roads with no one on them while Louisiana has crappy roads...
Anywho, on the way to Monroe, I am listening to music and semi speeding in the passing lane when I look in my rear view mirror and see this huge truck catching up with me. So I get in the slow lane to let him pass. As soon as he speeds past me, he slams on his breaks and I catch back up with him. He starts flagging me down and honking his horn. I look over and he smiles listening to his rap music. I break eye contact and drive a little faster after turning up my music to drown out his. Then he speeds up in front of me and makes me slow down so I have to go around him. He rolls down his window and yells that I am beautiful and give me his number...

Then at the roast some politician tells me that I am beautiful after we interview him. I told him thank you and then he said, &quot;but you already knew that...&quot; and I shrug. When the roast is over he finds me and says, &quot;don&#39;t forget what I said.&quot; How am I supposed to take that?

The next day I leave my hotel and start my 3 to 4 hour journey back home. Once I hit Mississippi, it starts raining hard. Before I know it I am driving backwards because the car has spun around and then I am sliding sideways off the road. As grass and mud cover the windshield I slam on the brake and brace myself for the car to flip. Fortunately it stops. Unfortunately, I am stranded in the muddy median. I tried to push my vehicle out the mud but it was stuck. My panicked self draws the attention of three trucks. The first one stops to see if I am ok. He gives me a towel. The second one also stops to see if I am ok and he lets me sit in his vehicle with his wife and little girl. The third one is a lovely teenage country boy with a rope. Before I knew it, they had me on the road and ready to go.

My co worker just posted this and tagged me in it haha

"event","<i>Saturday</i>, I learned how to shoot a gun. My first shot was a bullseye. I learned that I do not like shooting guns and would much rather learn archery... Like I have been wanting to do since middle school.

<i>Sunday</i>, I learned how to change oil. Doesn&#39;t seem that difficult.

<i>Monday</i>, I went to work and finished editing a BBB piece. The Police chief of EBRP was the keynote speaker. He announced that they arrested someone who my be the serial raper going around town. Later, after the DNA tests came back, they confirmed he was the person.

<i>Tuesday</i>, Snow day. I could have went to work though. The temperature drop didn&#39;t occur until after four, which was four hours behind the news prediction. Had I known that I could have at least worked half day. Only one co worker showed up but she is from Idaho... go figure. She posted Facebook meme&#39;s about the south and snow days vs. the north. Hopefully one day I will be a great driver in horrible weather conditions. I cannot wait to move out of state some where.

<i>Wednesday</i>, had to take a snow day because the roads were literally frozen over. Again, only one co worker showed up... yet again posting more jokes about how the south cannot survive &quot;snowmageddon2014.&quot; It is not like we can help it. Even our salt machine tricks are sliding on the ice and getting stuck in ditches.... We just do not know how to deal with this slush. Our soil is spongy. our pot holes fill with water that becomes ice... and we are just clueless on how to drive on ice.
Also, Louisiana has the worst drivers in America...Not a hopeless situation, but a pretty bad one for sure.

This whole situation reminds me when I went to Spain... people freaked out and dove for cover when it <i>rained</i> over there... But their version of rain is considered a drizzle or &quot;sprinkle&quot; over here. I wanted to dance in the droplets but it only lasted a few moments and, because it isn&#39;t humid over there, it evaporated instantly. We couldn&#39;t help but laugh at the locals. I am sure that is how northers feel about us during these &quot;snow days&quot;

Not sure how Thursday will go but I have a shoot Friday so I have to be there. If I worked from a News Station, I would have been traveling in the snow. Media is more reliable that the postal workers haha

"event","&quot;Seriously. It may SEEM to you like a &quot;filler show&quot; to you. But no one is going to hire you right out of college. You HAVE to work those jobs to get the experience people expect you to have before you walk in the door. Hell, I started as a grip for a commercial production company then went to running teleprompters for different news stations then SOMEONE gave me a camera just to LEARN ON then I got to start shooting news and sports then editing (LINEAR) then editing wedding videos (NON-LINEAR) which led to editing freakin INFOMERCIALS and THAT was my first DECENT paying gig. The time from the beginning to that one was about 6 years with a year and a half off to go to film school in Orlando. So your &quot;filler&quot; job is your wedding video job. But without it you&#39;ll never be able to appreciate where you&#39;ve been and what you&#39;ve learned when you get to somewhere awesome.

And YOU WILL. You have the right kind of drive, determination, and likability that people gravitate towards.&quot;

I love email pep talks from people from the past. They tell you what you need to hear when you need to hear it.
It was a reply to my: &quot;LNM or LHN... one of those. They are like filler shows in my opinion but without them I would not have a job.&quot;

Filler SHOW not filler JOB, but I&#39;ll take the rant.
It is good to know that someone believes in me.

Today I had a conversation with a man in a parking garage. Calm down, he was the ticket guy. He was not technology savvy at all. It all started when I gave him my folded up ticket voucher. He was having trouble unfolding the piece of paper and said it was because he didn&#39;t have nails. I laughed and told him I didn&#39;t have any either. He looked at me bug eyed, &quot;That&#39;s almost unheard of! Girls always have nails. Do you go buy them from the store or something?&quot; HA! I told him that have nails interfered with my videography. I don&#39;t have time to worry about my nails breaking or splitting or if they are polished. Then we started talking about his cell phone pictures. He told me that he had taken some pictures but they didn&#39;t come out. He said he tried to print them but they cam out awful. I told him it may be because of his settings... yes the camera in you phone has settings. Then he whipped out an old school flip phone and showed me a blurry picture of someone. I had my work cut out for me. I told him about how to avoid getting blurry pictures on his cell phone. I didn&#39;t want to insult his intelligence but he really didn&#39;t understand how to take a basic snapshot. He kept asked if there was a way to save the blurry pictures but they were not salvageable. I want to go back one day and teach him how to take a picture! Everyone should know the basics like reading and writing. Knowing how to take a good picture is a must.

"event","I had an amazing end of 2013 by taking myself out on a date where I made my resolution list for 2014. Then watched one of the most inspiring movies ever, The Secret life of Walter Mitty, with my best friend. I cried at the end and started applauding in which the entire room joined.

Then we joined more friends and went downtown. It wasn&#39;t as crowded as I thought it would be but it was fun. We went bar hoping (My first time to do this) and dancing in clubs. I watched as they came up with ridiculous new moves that I couldn&#39;t help but laugh at. Chilled with some co-workers for a bit and went off into the crowd. One of the clubs gave us campaign, which we took mobile in search for the RedStick ball drop haha. We went with the crown until it came to a halt. One of my friends took the lead and we zig zagged our way to the front. &nbsp; Everyone looked in the same general direction and starting counting down. At midnight we watched as the Red Stick statue stood there doing nothing haha. Then fire works erupted from behind the buildings and lit up the dark sky, Everyone start kissing and drinking and taking group pictures and selfies.

Our group started heading back to a bar and lines to entrances formed outside. I started to fish for my New Year kiss, because 1. Why not? 2. If not now, when? 3) Carpi Diem! So I finally found some one who was attractive and not in a group. I went up to him and asked him if he had a girlfriend in which he replied no. Then I asked how old he was, 22. I told him a needed a New Year&#39;s kiss and he grinned and we made out. Then he started talking to me... which I didn&#39;t expect. I introduced him to my friends and we had conversation but eventually we parted ways.

&nbsp;On to another bar. We met up with even more friends. Our group of six became thirteenish and sat down. I drank some random people&#39;s drinks just to taste them but then one of my friends stuck his drink in my face and turned the straw thinking I wouldn&#39;t drink it. So I chugged it all in one breath haha and didn&#39;t expect for the drunkardness that came after. Manly because I didn&#39;t taste the alcohol in his drink but I should have known better because this friend doesn&#39;t drink lite. I was high on life and now alcohol. I watched people holding up their drunk friends and random peopling falling in the road. We had lost one of our friends too.

I decided to go to the Ladies room while they looked for her. In the Ladies room there were a bunch of drunk older women talking about how their husbands had cheated on them and now they were going to &quot;screw&quot; them back by having sex with every one they could. haha Sad really... I joined my group again. They told me that they just say a girl fall and they guy that tried to help her up fell and busted his head. We were ready to go by that point. Driving to my friend&#39;s apartment was interesting too because the people in the vehicles around us were swerving in our lane. My best friend was our DD so he handled it very well and we all laughed at it. I remember not listening to Kanye, but some other form of music played and I think my words were slurring. When we got to the apartment, it was like 3am. I was in no condition to drive even after I waited an hour so I just stayed at his apartment.

It was by far one of the best New Years I&#39;ve ever had... mainly because I took risks... I am still thinking about that kiss. Anywho, here is to an amazing 2014. It started out right with with a bang!"

"event","I have been out of college for a seven months now.

I have learned much about my career path. It has forced me to be more outgoing, to fight for what I want and build my perspective. I have traveled many miles in these past months and I have networked with countless amounts of people. I have been told that I could not do something and that I would not make it. Now it is up to me to prove them wrong and make them eat their words.

I have dated guys and had a boyfriend. These relationships have taught me a lot about what I want, who I am, and who I want to be. I have learned that having children could be a possibility, travel is a must as well as adventure. and football is just not something I enjoy on a regular basis. I have been reinforced that not everyone was brought up the way I was... which is odd to me because it is the only life I know. I like differences in opinion though because they make life more interesting. I like viewing other people&#39;s perspectives and learning about how they grew up. I like beards now.&nbsp; Taking the time to type out a grammatically correct text is worth it in the end. Love means different things to different people. There is no such thing as &quot;Mr. Right&quot; and I believe that any two people can make a relationship work if both of their hearts are into it.

I have gained friends and I have lost friends. I have learned that sometimes the people that show up in our life are just passing through and are not meant to stay forever. Sometimes those friendships, as short lived as they were, mean the most. Time has a value in The Adult Life and anyone who is willing to spend it on you is truly a gift. People who do not make time for you are not worth having in your life, they are not worth your thoughts either.

Lazy people do more work.

God loves all people no matter their beliefs and it is not up to me to judge others on my faith. At the end of the day people have to do what they believe is right in their own hearts. I just wish people wouldn&#39;t be so hateful about it on all sides.
The Adult life is a classroom and should be one. You must always be constantly learning or else you slip into idiocracy. Too many people have already fallen and I refuse to be one of them.

Extra activities such as TV, movies, YouTube, Facebook and League of Legends. I have watched the TV shows that I missed out on in college due to focusing on school work. Although the shows are good, will I remember them in 10 years? No. How do I know this? I used to be a TV junkie in high school and I remember highlights from the shows I watched but that&#39;s about it. Therefore TV is not really worth the time. Movies help me learn more about the industry but not worth the price of watching them in theater. Honestly not really worth the time either. Youtube. If I spend my time wisely there I do actually learn things so it is worth spending time on. Facebook, I check it out of habit. Honestly I don&#39;t care about 3/4 of the people on it and so time waster indeed. League of Legends is worth it when playing with friends.

Self improvements: I read for at least one hour a day and I work out at least twice a week in some form.

I do believe it is ok to love people you hardly know, and trust strangers. I still believe in humanity.

My goal was Southeastern. My goal was school. I remember mapping out my life freshman year of high school.
1. Work at McDonalds until High School diploma
2. Pass ACT get TOPS
3. Go to Southeastern
4. Get Job
5. Get Married

racing to get some more conclusions
I watched the hunger games by myself

I drove in circles around my neighborhood
for thirty mins just thinking
sorry for typos i feel like im slurring haha
I wish i could put worlds down on paper while I thought them
that way all of this would make sense to you.
I&#39;ve had trouble finding ways to express myself lately
I know what I feel
I know who I am
but how to express it?
and what do I want?

Does any of it matter? We are just a breath in time. But some people are remembered so they make good use of their time.
Success means different things to different people.
I think i want to be successful. That seems to be a good thing to strive for, right? I miss college... but i dont
im in limbo stuck
and drifting on sleeping meds.

Easy money, got to meet all sorts of people
free jazz music and food
Got offered free drinks
it was grand.

Lately I have been noticing things about my life that has changed within a year.
Last year I celebrated Squanto Day with two of my closest friends.
It was a weekend that we all had duty on (I believe)
We went to try to find places that were open and settled on a subway in Walmart.
We bought sandwiches and snacks then went back to campus and had a picnic in the park
by a pond and talked. Things were so peaceful back then.
I wish I knew then what I do now. I don&#39;t know if I could enjoy the time I had more than I did...
maybe that&#39;s what makes things special,
the fact that they can never happen again.
I was an RA living on campus, struggling to survive college life
stressed to the max with school work but surrounded by loving friends.
I had wonderful residents, great professors, and no responsibility except to be a student
which I took seriously. I had multiple friends in my classes
and I had the luxury of seeing my friends everyday.

Now I&#39;m working everyday doing what I love
I have 3 to 4 co workers who are all friendly not family though
I have one friend from college who is family
I have a boyfriend.. was not expecting that this soon
I live at home
I go on my own adventures
I do my own things
I watch Breaking Bad with my boyfriend
I semi started playing league again

My schedule is
Wake up
workout
shower
breakfast
Joyce Meyer
hour of traffic
work
lunch/read
work
hour of traffic
Time with people
Home
Sleep

Way different from a year ago for sure...
Sometimes I&#39;m perfectly happy where I&#39;m at
other times, It&#39;s not enough
Always, I try to remember, it&#39;s about the journey
so sit back and enjoy.

You are no longer a student
You are no longer a teen
You are a young adult
this is your time
How will you use it?
I ready to change the world a live my dream life haha
I try to remember the job I have now is pretty perfect
as far as what I&#39;m doing.
I try to remember and not take for granted that I was somehow blessed with a job in my major almost immediately after graduation.
This job is mainly laid back and I can make mistakes. I get to travel. I get experience. I meet different people from all over.
The struggle is real enough.
With God all things are possible.

Never give up.

Sometimes I think about all that could be and what steps I need to take to get there. I don&#39;t want to hold back
I want to unleash and give this life everything I&#39;ve got.
I think it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t know exactly what I want.
Too many options again.
I mean I dislike the making of decisions after all.
The decisions I make are like climbing up a tree.
You choose branches but the further away from the interior you get
the less that is available to you and the weaker the limbs get beneath you
soon you have to assume the courage to jump to another tree
or stay until the limb you are on grows fragile and breaks.

In the end we are all pretending
pretending to know what we are doing
pretending to be confident
pretending to look perfect
pretending to have it all together.
Hoping one day to not have to pretend.

I met this old photographer on my job. We were in a hurry to get back to the studio but I couldn&#39;t help myself. I had to stop and soak in the moment of this guy who longed to talk about his adventures. He traveled the world taking amazing photographs. He told me of being in Africa taking pictures of giraffes one day and Antarctica the next. The man took pictures of grizzly bears catching salmon going upstream and how tomorrow he was going to go take pictures of snow monkeys. I wanted to cry I was so happy I met a person who was living the dream. Someone in the flesh, living something that seems to be but a distant fairy tale to me. His advise was that life begins after 60 and I told him I want it NOW I dont want to wait to have adventures, I want them not and at 60. He told me to marry a sugar daddy ah ma life.

I met an astronaut who said &quot;most kids dream of growing up and being rich but all I wanted was adventure. Well I got it!&quot;
I want both! I want adventure and money! I never want to be in debt but i also want to enjoy life and have adventure.

THERE HAS TO BE A WAY!! I will find this. I am determined to! I feel like my life should be MORE than it is now. I&#39;m tried of waiting for opportunity. I dont want to be one of those people who stay in the same spot their whole life at the same lame job doing lame daily things. They settle down, get married, have kids, have a white picket fence around their house. I dont want that. No offense to those that do. I want multiple places of residence all over the world. I want to explore and see things. I want to realize how small I am in this huge world. I think I&#39;ve finally found someone who wants these things too. Keep your passion on fire people. Keep your vision boards and work hard. Together we can all turn our dreams in reality.

Rant over!&nbsp;"

"event","On my way home from work, sitting in traffic, I turned my radio off and listened to the ambient sounds around me. I turned the air conditioner off and rolled down my window. I looked at the scenery around me and started praying about my future. I prayed about everything I wanted my future to look like and what my desires were. I prayed about where I was in life and where I wanted to end up, how I wanted to die. Then I thought about how dying is difficult but since I was a kid I&#39;d been a fern believer that God would just take me. I would disappear without a trace. There are mentions of such happenings in the Bible and I would be honored if God would bless me with this. However, after pondering about death I started thinking about life. Life may be more difficult than dying in some cases, I&#39;m unsure since I haven&#39;t experienced much of life and no death besides that of loved ones. Then I earnestly told God, &quot;I trust you to take care of my life. Whatever road I&#39;m on I trust you to get me through it and whatever death you have for me I know you&#39;ll be there every step of the way.&quot; For the first time in a LOOOONG time I felt very close to God. It&#39;s hard to explain so I&#39;m going to put it into whatever form makes sense.

My whole life I haven&#39;t the slightest clue who I was, who I wanted to be, and where I wanted to end up. I always felt out of place and weird. I felt like everyone was good at something but me or at least had some sort of direction. I planned on graduating college with a General Studies major because I wasn&#39;t interested in anything.

I was classified under Undecided my sophomore year at SELU. They forced me to to choose a major after that so I stumbled into General Studies, Major concentration in Mass Communication (only because they were rumored to teach video classes), Minor concentrations in English and Photography. After taking some Comm classes one of my teacher told me they were coming out with a new Communications concentration called Electronic Media. I didn&#39;t do any research, I just jumped in. Even then, I had no idea what was happening in my life.

I felt God saying, &quot;You panicked so much but I had you the whole time. Look at all I have done in your life thus far. Yesterday you got to interview an astronaut. Did you ever dream your life would be anything like this 4 years ago? I was with you then when you were in turmoil, I&#39;m with you now, and I will take care of you in the future.&quot;

Four years ago I didn&#39;t know this field existed. I&#39;ve already done more, seen more, and met more people, than some do their entire lives and I&#39;m introverted... 

God has a plan and a reason behind everything. Sometimes my life is rough and causes me to look to the sky and squeal &quot;Ma life!&quot; but I keep reminding myself to look at the positives. I got this! Friends rotate in my life like seasons change. Boyfriends come and go. Family issues are ongoing. God is the same. God is good. God is worth it. He only wants the best for me and will never love me more than He does now. I&#39;ve made so many mistakes and still wound up where I needed to be."

Got a raise at work and a &quot;good job&quot; ha I guess that means I&#39;m permanent staff now.
My life has changed so much over the course of four months.
Karen is leaving for Florida. One of my friends overdosed on LSD.
Still shaken about that.
Been sought after by creepers.
Been having the time of my life at work

I dont long to go back to school anymore.
I feel free. I enjoy life.
Like I&#39;ve never just let go,
I feel young instead of old
I feel independent and light
I have drive and passion.
I have been making a difference in people&#39;s lives
even if it is small.
I love traveling the state
I love meeting people
I love filming everything
I actually love learning how to operate my camera
yup MY camera muahahaha
Editing has been a challenge though
but hey challenge accepted. I can only get better
and one day I&#39;ll read this post and LAUGH.
We have nothing to fear but fear itself
even the Bible says so.
Which I love being in love with God again
And exercise is medicine for the body
I enjoy it.
Oh and I made major progress yesterday.
I cleaned my bed off!!!
Today I realized though in the span of 4 months
I havent just cleaned off my bed.
I reorganized 6 drawers full of clothes
my entire closet and my bookshelves.
I havent done that in a while prob a decade.
Now all that is left is my desk, dressers and floor
and then a generic walk through.
Baby steps haha

I watched a meteor shower tonight
I bought a homeless man food
(still feels weird)

I really like a guy

It worked because now I don&#39;t spend time thinking about college anymore
or trying to stay in touch with people who are simply too busy to stay in touch.
Understandable, but I&#39;m not there anymore so my mind should be here.
Ever since I &quot;let go&quot; people from the adult life have been coming in to fill the void.
Some of them are new friends and some are old connections.
It&#39;s weird living at home again.
How Baton Rouge can seem more like a small town than Hammond... baffles me.
I suppose it&#39;s because in Hammond people were from all over the world
and they were so close... but
here it&#39;s three high schools and LSU football.

Even though my grandpaw has been buried for close to 20 years, he lives on.
People I&#39;ve never even met before remember all the great things he did.
He was a firefighter and a carpenter and he was in the navy.
I honestly don&#39;t know much about him.
Except that he loved me so much he quit smoking.
We used to argue about who owned the moon, me or him.
He was the first person I ever took a picture of
and that was the last picture ever taken of him.
He used take me to the store and i&#39;d beg him to buy me a stuffed animal
he always did... I have too many haha.
Pieces of him have faded
like the sound of his voice, what he looked like, memories.
People have tried to twist what memories I have left of him
but I know the truth.

Today all they had to say was his name and people instantly remembered
He was always helping people.
It&#39;s funny how funerals bring people together."

When you can tell a girl is about to cry, instinct tells you
ask her &quot;what&#39;s wrong&quot;
NOPE. Fight instinct.
The proper thing to do is to ask her if she is ok
then try to comfort her and make her smile.
Give her a hug tell her everything will be ok.
Ask questions where she can nod yes or shake her head no.
Never ask her whats wrong until she&#39;s better.
She will probably tell you once she has collected herself.
When everyone asks &quot;what&#39;s wrong?&quot;
It&#39;s difficult to explain without crying which is what
she is trying to avoid.
You are welcome."

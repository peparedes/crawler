"event","Yesterday I spent $145 on makeup. At once. On makeup. I think I am crazy. I couldn't help it. It was like it was seriously calling my name. I have never been so compelled to buy something in my entire life! I woke up with my eyes swollen and puffy, and was out the door 15 minutes later. I was wearing a sweatshirt, dirty jeans, and my Fuggs (Fuckin' Dirty Ass Uggs). My hair was greasy, I forgot my makeup, and I had 3 brand-new volcanic zits on my face. As soon as we got to Cherry Creek Mall, (OK, after I stopped at Peaberry and had coffee) I booked it to Urban Outfitters and bought myself some sunglasses. I needed to cover up my eyes, pronto! Yes, I was one of those annoying chicks that wears sunglasses indoors. After an unsuccessful attempt to find decent shoes (my 4th time this week), I met up with Joanna and she drug me into Neiman Marcus because she wanted to show me this ""dreamy"" makeup at Bobbi Brown. I felt so damn out of place in there, frumping along amongst the store models and perfectly poised salesgirls. When she was done picking out what she wanted, she turned to the salesman and said as she motioned to me, ""Lets do her make up too."" To put it bluntly, when I was done, I looked fucking amazing! The makeup girl had the most amazing skin, and she was absolutely brilliant! I told her she had no choice... she was coming to California with us to do our makeup all weekend. I WISH! I don't remember much from then until the moment I walked out of the store, but I left there $145 poorer! I'm still not really sure what exactly I bought. All I know is that as long as I can figure out how to put it on right, I am going to look SMASHING!

Oh, I didn't mention the splurge that started off this vain, money-driven spree... tanning. Wednesday I bought a bunch of tans and a bottle of lotion I am sure is totally unnecessary. I tanned on Wednesday, and again yesterday, and then immediately after yesterday's UV poisoning, I did what they call a 'Double Dip' and went straight into the sunless tan booth. I've used it before, and I know I am not totally incompetent, but I felt like such a retard in there. Per Joanna's brilliant advice, I put one of those plastic shower-caps on each foot in addition to the one on my head. (My feet will turn a nasty shade of orange if I don't cover them up, and I forgot the socks I ususally wear). With the plastic on my feet, my little 'marching' dance turned out to be more like a Napoleon Dynamite-esque dance sequence... except with more stickiness and claustrophobia. I kept slipping on the floor of the booth, and banging my elbows on the walls. After that fun little experience, I looked like an Oompa-Loompa. Seriously. Sans the green hair and unflattering overalls. It was only for 8 hours though. Ha. 

Bottom line here I guess is that looking good can cost a lot of money. A lot. Good thing I'm not any uglier, 'cause I don't think I could afford to fix it if I was.

I am kinda excited. In 12 Hours, I will be on a plane on the way to California. Granted, the majority of the trip will be spent in a continuous state of frantic uncertainty. I have to do something I'm not yet trained to do. The only other person who knows how to do it is stuck in Indiana until her doctor clears her to fly... which won't be in time for her to make it. Oh well. I still get to go to California, and we have dinner reservations for The Ivy tomorrow night. This is gonna be fun!"

"event","So maybe I should update this or something. I was thinking I might actually start writing in here... I like the idea that no one I really know would read it, so it's more like a journal than any other blog. It's not like I don't have 2 other blogs I could write in. I'm not a huge writer, really. I like to write, but I have to be in the mood, and I guess I'm just not there most of the time. I have to be in 'the zone' to do anything remotely productive. Maybe I am allergic to 'the zone'.

Ya know what though? I really am hating iTunes right now. None of my music will play on iTunes anymore, which means not only do I have to use stupid Windows Media Player, but now I can't update my iPod! I am PISSED! I need to update it before I go to California, or I won't have my RENT soundtrack songs, or my new Adam Pascal songs from Civilian. SOOOOO SAD! Stupid Apple. Stupid Bill Gates. Stupid Computers. I hate them all.

So last night, I had the most fun I have had in a long time. After she bought gas with a bag of pennies, Megan and I went to the RAD house for the St. Patty's day party. I love the RAD house... we always have such a good time there. Cool people, good music, awesome bar. Those guys could start charging admission, and everyone would still come, and they could make tons of money off our sorry asses. I made sure not to get myself fucked up on Jungle Juice like I did last time I was there... that wasn't fun. We had Killians, Guiness, Car Bombs, and Green Apple Jello shots... how festive. How come I didn't notice the pole last time I was there? we definitely did this time.... ha ha ha. Oh- a word of advice for you kids... just say NO to Captain Morgan. Just dump that shit on the floor, and pretend you're taking the shot. No one will notice.

The water polo boys decided to play strip pong somewhere during the course of the night, and Nick's pants disappeared. Hmmmmm. Danielle had *nothing* to do with it! Right when we were leaving , they got some more music on, and they put on a Flogging Molly song... so I had to do a jig... and Nick (still in his underwear, mind you) instructed me to pour the rest of my Killians down his back. So I did. And he kept dancing like a fool. And we left. Anyway, Meg and I walked back to her house afterwards, and almost got killed by a drunk driver (again). I was soooo hungry, but Wendy's was closed, so we called Silver Mine when we got back, but unfortunately, they informed us that they had run out of bread. WTF? You're a damn sandwich shop... how the hell do you run out of bread? You gotta plan for that shit. Or don't answer the phone. 

Well, I know I am pretty random, but you're just gonna have to deal with that. 

On Thursday I leave for California for Expo, and today I went shopping for 'professional' clothes to wear. I need 3 suits... it's kinda fun. I like looking 'professional'... it makes me look like I actually have a fucking cue what I am doing in this job. I still need shoes, camel pants, a black jacket, a gray jacket, and shirts to go with everything. Aaaahhhhh! What I really want is some cute shoes... some HOT shoes. I'm not sure how my feet will feel about that, especially at the end of the weekend, but I can deal.

OK, I am off to bed now. I definitely didn't get enough sleep last night, and now I am going downhill fast."

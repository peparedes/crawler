"event","And so, as one chapter ends, another begins. 

It's customary that I bring my big chapters back to live-journal, so here I am again to commemorate the moment they way it ought to be done. 

Today was my last day as a Broward Health employee. After four years at the company, I tendered my resignation two weeks ago to a shockingly ""supportive"" and oddly excited boss.  I'm sure some might remember a few posts back where I detailed how my boss suffers from the crazies, so her reaction to my resignation came as a bit of a surprise to me. 

I know I'd mentioned a few instances of outrageous behavior in the last work-post I made, and I'm sad to say the situation only escalated from there forward.  It all snowballed out of control so quickly, I couldn't even tell you when it began.  She had me working like a dog during the legislative session to make sure this big project was done.  Once that went off without a hitch, without so much as a word of recognition for a job well done, she started in on me.  

She continued to completely sabotage my work and would accuse me of dropping the ball on things when, in reality, she was not following up on my countless requests.  She then accused me of sabotaging (word of the day!) my co-workers, being a huge screw up, being the weakest link in the department, and then told me she'd have a new employee on me ""like white on rice.""  She said I sucked, I was useless and terrible.  Oh, and then she called me learning disabled. 

Wait, let me go back.  I had confided in her about the problems I was having with Katherine so she would understand why I needed to leave early on a few separate occasions (the psychologist was in Miami).  She later threw that back in my face, saying ""some of the qualities your daughter has that you complain about...I see most of them in you. Call it a learning disability or whatever.""

Once that conversation was over, I locked myself in the office conference room and cried for 45 minutes.  I was at my wit's end.  I went to seek help at the Employee Assistance office. They said there was nothing they could do for me.  I applied for every job I could find, even applying for those I was overqualified for & willing to take a pay cut to move.  I explored options to downsizing my living expenses and even considered moving back to Miami if my parents could use their contacts to find me a job down south. I contacted every person I knew and asked them to please keep me in mind if they knew of any leads.  I could feel myself on the brink of meltdown and wondered if I was going to snap one day soon.  If I did, I could pretty much count myself out of a job, so my parents and I put a plan in place for such an event.  One after the other, I received e-mail notices telling me the jobs had been filled without so much has having received a call back.  It was pretty devastating. 

I soon found myself constantly depressed.  Nothing made me happy & having to report to work made my sick to my stomach. My parents suggested therapy.  Her abuse continued to escalate. She stripped me of all of my duties and would bad mouth me to my co-workers.  She stopped calling me, refused to talk to me and refused to meet with me to review my work.  She would hold department staff meetings and exclude only me, leaving me feeling alienated.  She trashed all of my work product and reduced me to a quivering pile of insecurity, basically.  With my confidence at an all time low, I found myself incapable of even writing an e-mail without a certain level of anxiety about what she would say. I felt my job was threatened as she had left me with no real job functions & worst of all, I couldn't understand what I had done to bring all of this on.  I asked my co-worker and she couldn't identify what the trigger was either.  It appeared I had just ended up the target of emotional terrorism.  

And then came the fateful Monday where I walked into work to find my desk stripped bare.  Apparently, the Sunday before, she raided my work space and took every single piece of paper she could find.  She checked under my desk, in all of my cabinets, in my inbox & through all of my files.  She confiscated everything and took it into my co-worker's office.  She then labeled everything with my own post-its (which I had gone out-of-pocket for, since I like the colorful stuff), with horrible messages, asking me why things weren't done, why they were lying around...she even left a post it on a pair of shoes under my desk, asking me why they were there.  She then called me and told me that the things she found around my desk were totally unacceptable and that she was going to write me up for them. According to her, some of it was too old to not have been taken care of. 

I felt so violated. She went through ALL of my things. I later found my notepads in her office, stashed away because I'm sure she meant to keep them.  In a fit of rage, I took them back, packed up what was left of my belongings and waited for her to fire me.  But she never did. She spent 2 weeks telling me she was going to sit down and go over the piles with me and then write me up. If she had taken the time to really go over the piles with me, I would have been able to explain to her that 90% of the things she had found were copies and reference material that I kept around to make sure the things I did were in proper form.  She never bothered asking and she never wrote me up. She was just content to leave me sitting there with a feeling of impending doom for 2 weeks of my life. I think I must have aged 10 years in those two weeks.  I've never had any form of disciplinary action in any of my files.  Quite the contrary, every boss I've ever had has been really happy with my performance.  Just last September, she herself had rated me well above expectations in my annual evaluation.  I was just beside myself. 

I was feeling a lot like a caged animal being poked with a stick. I'm sure she was doing these things because she could get away with them, knowing I had no way out and no way to bite back.  And then, just like that, the heavens finally opened up and smiled down on me, lol.  Gina's boss was looking for a paralegal (which I happen to be) and was willing to consider me.  Gina gave me a glowing recommendation and I was given the job.  It was as if a weight had physically been lifted off of my shoulders.  Indescribable. My gratitude to Gina is immeasurable, she really & truly saved me.   

So, with a new lease on life, I went ahead and resigned from this position and its as if the switch on my boss somehow automatically flipped the other way.  I suspect she suddenly reverted to a charming and supportive version of herself to do some damage control. I think she knows she overstepped boundaries and she doesn't want me to take it HR. I'm sure I had a lawsuit in there somewhere. I think she honestly thought she was a-okay because I wouldn't find any other jobs in this market.  I'm so happy she was wrong.  I could sense her observing my mannerisms and reactions to see if I was up to anything. She had a crazed look in her eye. And just like that, we were best friends again. Throughout the past two weeks, she's been calling all the time, sending me work constantly, entrusting me with things & finding time to chit chat and ask about my family. She praises my work product and responds to all of my e-mails, inquiries and requests.  She then insisted that I send her all of my contact information and that she & I do lunch together alone (without the co-workers) because we've always been so close -- she calls me the daughter she never bore.  It's all been so surreal.  I'm almost angry at myself because of how easy it is to forget all of the horrors she's been imparting while she's being nice.  That's how I know I've been subjected to this abuse too long... I think I'm suffering from some kind of Stockholm Syndrome. She's been asking me if I'm excited about this new job and keeps insisting that she feels it's truly the best move for me. She says she has all the faith in the world in me and thinks I'll excel in my new role. She also says I'm extremely bright & vibrant and would do well anywhere (?).

But the boss and her insanity aside, I truly am sad about having to leave a great company and some of the truly wonderful people there.  I can't even explain how bitter it makes me to know that things would be different were it not for this woman who has made it her mission to terrorize me and strip me of my dignity. [Hello, drama queen]

My co-worker and I have become really close over the last year, and all she's been saying it how much she's going to miss me.  As a parting gift, she bought me 2 new sweaters so I'll ""look nice at my new job."" She also brought a cake to work and she and the new guy treated me to lunch.  Two old friends from another department also treated me to lunch and I've had people giving me cards and contact information and hugs left, right & sideways.  I'm probably the most-hugged person in America today, honestly.  Today, another friend of mine treated me to lunch as well & then the boss took me to dinner, where she cranked up the charm some more and made the whole thing really quite pleasant.  I've eaten like a pig all week.  

I will miss so many things and so many people, but I'm actually finally looking forward to something for the first time in a long time & for that, I feel really fortunate. Really blessed. 
Wish me luck, Live-journal.  It's the start of something new."

I just got an e-mail via Facebook informing me that my 10 year reunion is approaching.

First off, where the HECK have the last 10 years gone? I can't have passed by just like that, right? Holy crap.
Secondly, thanks, alumni committee, but no thanks. I think I might pass on this one. Its not like I don't already know what most of my class is up to anyway, thanks to Facebook.  The truth is, I only really care about a handful of people from La Salle anyway - Laura, Katie and Patty pretty much cover it.  

Anyway, I hope you guys had a nice weekend. It feels like they come and go way too fast.  I had one of those weekends where I feel like I wasted too much time sleeping and not enough time doing useful things. 

On Saturday, I woke up at like 12:30 in the afternoon :( I hate sleeping in like that. I spent the early afternoon cleaning up around the house until it was time to head Chipotle and the movies with Michi, Jina and Gina.  I was late, as always.

We went to see <i>No Strings Attached</i>, which was alright. I wasn't blown away.
After the movie, I came home and watched <i>RED</i> with Jeff and I <b>REALLY</b> enjoyed that one.  The cast was great and the movie was really funny.  I may watch it again before its time to return the DVD. I also rented <i>Secretariat, Runaways</i> and <i>Conviction</i> which I'm really looking forward to watching too. 

Today, I actually woke up at around 10:30, which wasn't too bad, and I threw some laundry in before it was time to get dressed to go to lunch at my mom's.  The whole family went down and enjoyed mom's pepper steak and Jeff got to watch half the Super Bowl there while I went to see my dad for a little while.  

My dad was actually in the middle of ""family dinner"" with his new girlfriend, her daughter and the daughter's son, who's 4 and incredibly annoying.  When I showed up at the restaurant, I felt like I was intruding on a family moment, which was odd and a little obnoxious. Still, I was there to see my dad so I addressed him when he spoke to me and ignored the rest. Once they were done eating, I passed by his house for a while and ended up leaving with an entire PC he didn't want anymore, lol.  He had this ACER desktop, practically brand new, but he's decided that he's going to use laptops only at his new house.  I don't exactly know what to do with the computer, but I figured I could put it to good use somewhere, sometime. If not, I'll find someone who needs it.

I just broke my index finger nail down beneath the skin, so I'm going to go weep softly into my pillow now, if you don't mind. That bitch hurts.

Good night LJ :)"

"event","Now that I've burdened you all with my wah wah wahing, let me move on to fluffier topics. In no particular order: 

School is going well and I'm a straight A student! Makes me wonder why I didn't try harder before, back when my only focus was school and school alone. I obviously had the capacity to make the grades, I just never wanted to do the work. Youth is so wasted on the young.

Tomorrow, I will hopefully be getting together with two of my lovely friends for burritos and a movie date. I'm definitely looking forward to the mental reprieve. 

I've been spending copious amounts of money on Hello Kitty things lately, my most recent purchasing being a hello kitty sewing machine. I'll have to photgraph it and post pictures. 

I've also been dropping money on makeup a lot lately and am hoping to learn little by little how to best beautify my face. Lord knows I'll never get my body into shape, so I may as well be proud of at least one thing.

My mother is engaged. We are happy for her.

My father is discussing engagement. We are not happy for him. 

I will be celebrating my 5 year anniversary with my boy in July.

Boyfriend and I are re-doing the kitchen on the cheap and its looking pretty amazing, I think. Especially considering the whole thing cost us all of $300. Pictures to follow once its finished. 

I want to learn how to knit so that I can make my own Gryffindor scarf. And maybe a matching hat.

World of Warcraft takes up way too much of my free time. Yes, still. 

I'm a faithful watcher of Pretty Little Liars, Hellcats and the Vampire Diaries, further reinforcing that my mind still hasn't left high school.

I am still addicted to painting my nails and my polish collection has quadrupled in size. 

Jeffrey supports my addiction when he probably really shouldn't.

I'm hungry right. this. instant.
That is not unusual.

I still write bad fanfiction, a fact that I'm not entirely proud of, but we're partaking in honesty hour here, people.

I think I'm warming up to dad's pet horse a little (his girlfriend) but I still can't stand her laughing hyena of a daughter or her marsupial looking grandson.

I adore my dad but he's a fool.

I can't think of anything else, but if something comes to mind. You may get another micro-blogesque entry. 

Toodles."

"event","I've been been awake since the ass crack of dawn, which normally would be more than enough of a reason for me to be grumpy. But that's not my problem today.  Today I'm grumpy because Jeffrey had to leave for New York.  Without me.  
This is the first time in 4 years that he won't be sleeping in our bed.  First time in 4 years that I'll spend 24 full hours away from him.  This whole thing has me damn near inconsolable, lol.  How ridiculous.  I know I'm a clingy girlfriend, but c'mon.  I feel like a kid who just lost her puppy.  I swear, if I cry one more time today, I'm going to smack myself straight across the face.  

This all takes me back to the beginning of our relationship before he moved here from NY.  Those were some tough months.  He and I have always been strangely attached to each other and even though we jumped into things quickly, we never doubted for a second that all we wanted was 24/7 with each other.  He was in tears this morning when he left, all the way up to getting out of the car at the airport. I had to pry his arms off of me.  

Oh, and my other problem - planes make me so nervous. I know they're supposed to be the safest form of travel and all of that but when you're up there, your fate is in the hands of some pilot and his buddy and how closely they're paying attention.  If that plane goes down, you don't stand a fighting chance.   It scares the piss out of me.  I've been praying to God, Jesus, the angels & saints and to the Virgin Mary so that she'll cover Jeffrey in her sacred mantle.  I had DREAMS last night that I was praying to all of these people, too.   Again, back to ridiculous....

And that would be another reason I'm grumpy, I guess. Sleep didn't come easily to me last night.  I feel like I was only half asleep all night long.  I worked until close to 8 last night and I'm tired today :(  I think I can officially say that this day sucks.  I was going to do a more general journal update, but I think I may have to make a separate post.  I don't want to mix the funk with the regular stuff. 

I do want to end this on a bright note though - my two cuddly pups keep edging each other out of the warm spot next to my laptop and leg. It makes me feel like they're fighting to cuddle with me, even though they probably aren't, lol.   

Anyway, bye."

"event","I need a vacation.  I'm long overdue for a vacation. 
But...I will I get a vacation any time soon? Probably not.  

It's been kind of a rough week. The weekend was nice enough but the week has been hectic and exhausting.

For starters, I was involved in a car accident this morning and I'm super uncomfortable now.  I can't find any position to sit in where I feel comfortable.  It's aggravating.  This morning, on my way to work, some d-bag cabbie made a dead stop in the center lane of the road so that he could butt into a super long line for the left turning lane.  I had to hit my brakes because he came to a dead stop at a green light but I guess the woman behind me didn't notice and she plowed into my rear end.  It was a miracle that I didn't plow into the cabbie.  Anyway, her car had to be towed and she was issued a citation, which made me feel kind of bad for her.  Still, she hit me damn hard and now my back hurts and my car is coated in the diet coke I was holding when she hit me.  A less than desirable situation, I say.  At least her insurance responded quickly...I'm going to take the car in for repairs tomorrow.     

My ""bad week"" actually started last Friday, where, upon arriving at work, I was greeted by a voicemail from my co-worker Paula.  For those of you that aren't familiar, Paula is a sickly, frail 60 year old smoker with a serious chronic cough. She's a sweet little lady, but I worry about her sometimes.  So, anyway, I get to work and there's a voicemail waiting for me and it's from Paula and she sounds like she's gasping for air and there's a whoosh of wind around her that I wasn't able to identify until later in the message.  Apparently, Paula was on an oxygen machine and was at the hospital with a major shortness of breath. So I relay the message to my boss and I'm worried about Paula but I figure she'll probably be out in a day or 2 when they figure out the problem. I'm working through my day, blissfully ignorant and Iwas even able to speak to Paula later in the day. I ended up wrapping up the day reassured that all would be right with the world.  Well, come Monday, I get to work and my boss and I get together to call Paula for a status update. Paula doesn't answer, but the nurse does. Paula had taken a turn for the worse, had remained in ICU all weekend and was now intubated. Cue the tears. We don't know what it is that put her in the hospital, how to fix it or when we'll be seeing her again & it's been nerve wrecking.

Bad news aside, the weekend was actually enjoyable.  I went to a birthday party on Saturday for a little girl that goes to school with Kat.  Her mother is a delightful Russian woman who came to the US 8 or 9 years ago and who loves to chat outside of the school in the mornings. We've become great friends over the last year or so.  Anyway, I went to their house for the party but arrived late so my Russian friend sat me down at a table with her family.  Yeah, her Russian family. The ones who didn't speak a lick of English.  That was fun.  They made no effort to communicate with me and didn't return my friendly smiles so I just kind of sat there for half an hour, quietly munching on pizza.  The only time Karina's (my friend) mom acknowledged me was when she was thirsty, lol.  She looked down at her cup and then up at me.  Then back down at her cup. Then she tipped it in my direction.  So I asked her if she wanted a drink and she nodded once.  I pointed to the lemonade and she shook her head no.  I asked her if she wanted sprite and she nodded yes.  I picked up the sprite and poured her about half a cup before she hand signaled for me to cut the stream and then took a long swig.  She then proceeded to ignore the heck out of me and started talking to her family in Russian again, lol. She was an absolute joy.  Better still, I made the mistake of turning to look at Karina's 75 year old aunt just as she was laughing heartily about something and I nearly lost it when I saw that the woman had a mouth full of yellow gold grills.  It was then and there that I had to excuse myself from the table.  The rest of the party was uneventful, but it would have been hard to top table-time anyway.

On Sunday, Gina and Natasha came over for some girly time and that was highly enjoyable.  Time flew by while I had those 2 hanging around in my kitchen eating pizza. 

Monday was a long day, what with news of Paula's health and my boss' subsequent freak out over our being short staffed.  I ended up working till 8 that night.  On Tuesday, I had to head down to my mom's house for her birthday party.  I can't imagine what on earth one would find enjoyable about having 40 people up in your house on a Tuesday night, but mom seemed to enjoy it.  As for me, it only served to add to my exhaustion.  Yesterday, I was able to leave work on time and run to the financial aid office at school.  I feel much better knowing that I straightened out all of that stuff in advance and that I'll be able to register for classes after advisement next Wednesday.

And yeah, that brings us back to today which has now brought this entry full circle.  I should probably get my rear in gear and get to bed, but truth be told, I'm actually enjoying this infomercial for 80s power ballads ft. the dude from REO Speedwagon who is, quite frankly, tearing it up on my TV with hit after hit from my childhood and then some.  Heck yeah.

Bahh, maybe bed will help my back.  Night night people.

Wait, no. Not that kind of phone post. This is your garden variety post done from a smart phone. A smart phone that generally isn't very smart at all, so kindly excuse any typos in the post. The <i>phone</i> post. 

So the weekend is gone and I am left here feeling  kind of sad that its over. It's too easy to get used to not having to work. I am, of course, stupid-sleepy which is making work downright painful.  It's all my fault though...I shouldn't have been sitting on World of Warcraft until all  hours of the night. I will  admit that I thoroughly enjoyed playing yesterday which had not been the case for many months prior to last night's raid. Sometimes content gets repetitive and playing feels more like  a chore than fun. Yesterday was a reminder of what's still  fun in that game.

Anyway, my weekend was a good mix of eventful and uneventful which was just what I needed after several weeks of hecticness. Friday I took the family to see the Last Airbender which proved to be downright disappointing :/ We had really high hopes but in the end, it kind of fell flat. On Saturday morning, Katherine was picked up by her non-payment-making ""father"" which freed up my Saturday and Sunday a bit. After having planted myself on the couch for what felt like an eternity, I got up and got dressed to go to <lj user=""mad-turtle"">'s house for some barbeque fun. She was, as usual, a great hostess & the food was delicious. They got me kind of liquored up, which was interesting, lol.  Friggin' fruit punch and scooby snacks were yummy but I could have done without the Patrone (sp?). 

Sunday was uneventful. Jeffrey and I went to eat sushi and then to a thrift store where he picked up 3 polos for a dollar each. Two were from Express. Not a bad deal. Later in the evening, Kat came home and we all went to dinner with my daddy. The weather was yucky so we passed on the fireworks and all of that 7/4 fanfare. Monday we all went to Delray Beach to see the hotel my mom was renting at and she took us all to lunch. We ended up at this place called ""The Office"" and holy crap was that place good. It was a burger place and, though pricey, was some of the best food I've ever eaten. I had a Florida Blue Crab burger and it  was just sinful.  I strongly recommend that place if you all  are ever in Delray.  When burger time was over, we all skidattled and caught an afternoon showing of Eclipse (second time for me, first time for Jeff). 
And then, after a night of WoW, my weekend was over :(  Saddies.

Interesting random happening: My mom was at a bbq wearing 2 bracelets i made her and some woman there saw them and apparently liked them. My mom totally gave them away :( But the lady asked me to make more so that she can sell them at some show. Hmm. Let's see what happens there, I guess.

Anyway, its back to work for me. Toodleloo.

PS- I hate my autotext sometimes. 

PPS- Happy bday to Cheryene <3"

"event","Ooooookay! So I have FINALLY uploaded the before and after pictures of my living room.  I think I'd mentioned on a previous post that I did some work to my condo & that I would share the photos.  True to style, I'm late. But better late than never!

I have a lot of stuff to post about and a lot of pictures to share, but those will have to wait for another day.  Motivation & inspiration has been scarce lately, so my poor journal has been horribly neglected. Forgive me, journal. I value our 8 year relationship more than you could ever know. &hearts;

So, let me give you a little guide here. My condo's living room are is kind of shaped like a giant rectangle. Its one big room.  You enter from the front door, obviously, and there's a short hallway.  To the left, the hallway extends to Kat's room and the bathroom.  To the right of the door is the kitchen & if you go forward, you hit the living room. From the living room, there's a door to our room and inside of our room is another bathroom.  My biggest challenge has been breaking up the living room in functional little spaces.  I'm not very good at that. 

Without further adieu, here are the before pictures of my living room.  And if you're wondering, yes, I am embarrassed over how ugly it was.  It was also a little on the messy side because we were already boxing things up for painting. 

<lj-cut text=""Out with the old"">

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4633761947_d38a8bf379.jpg"" BORDER=""10"">
A view of the couch & chair from the vantage point of the TV.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3329/4633762373_61c7b5faf2.jpg"" BORDER=""10"">
A view of the chair next to the couch (w/ a box on it). Behind are the dog crates and the DVD rack. You can see the door to my room & part of the hall to Kat's room.  The end table pictured next to the chair would tilt if you even looked at it the wrong way.  It was like 6 years old & I bought it for $25 on abcdistributing.com, so imagine what kind of shape it was in. 

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4633763027_26b9a544ef.jpg"" BORDER=""10"">
A view of the computer desks & part of the TV.  In b/t the desks is my printer.  My hamster cage is next to my desk.  Please pay special attention to the carpet as it will be the first thing to go.

Picture of my computer desk, my TV, my old curtains & my hamsters.  Jeff's gaming chair is tossed there in the middle of the living room.  This is kind of from the vantage point of the couch, but not quite.  Its more off to the side, by the DVD rack, I guess.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4023/4633764583_9c0e3bd868.jpg"" BORDER=""10"">
This is a more complete view of the couch, curtains, gaming chair, coffee table and TV.

</lj-cut>

Not pictured at all was a view from the living room to the kitchen, the bookshelf and the dining room table.  As you can see, the place certainly could use a facelift.  

It all started with an innocent trip to Target (doesn't it always?) where I happened to pass by a clearance shelf.  Sitting there on the shelf were these pillows that I immediately fell in love with.  The ""color scheme"" of the living room was orange/red/terra cotta/brown, etc & there were some pillows that matched that perfectly.  I, however, opted to buy the exact same style but in blue/green/yellow/brown. which matched absolutely nothing in my living room. 

<lj-cut text=""In with the new""> 

Here is the pillow that started it all:
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3394/4634331836_a6fc173b0c.jpg""BORDER=10>
I can't resist a clearance item at Target. 

So we went ahead and decided to paint the place.  We settled in on a nice green hue.  
Here is a shot of the TV which now sits where the couch/chair/end table used to be:
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/4634332662_76bc919ef5.jpg""BORDER=10>
You can see the now-green walls and the new wall decor. The big pot & bamboo are new too.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4029/4634328624_7846eb41be.jpg""BORDER=10>
And here's another view of the TV along w/ the artist formerly known as the terra cotta arm chair.  Slapped a slip cover on that bad boy and scooted it into the corner. 

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4634327810_0c8962a0cb.jpg""BORDER=10>
Right across from the TV is the couch and the !!!new pillows!!!  Behind the couch is a desk holding the surround sound which will soon be replaced by a couch table.  Behind that is the DVD rack, the bookshelf, the hamsters and a new side table & lamp.  The coffee table was replaced with 3 little ottomans which are a lot more comfy and practical. 

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4071/4634327110_f28e1263da.jpg""BORDER=10>
An almost full view of the room, including my big blue chair which I'm posting from right now. I don't know how I lived 26 years without this chair.  I think I'm in love.  Also featured in the picture are the dogs, the new floor, the new area rug, new curtains & new lamp. 

Allow me to feature my glorious blue chair one more time:
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4023/4633731351_9bebe0cbae.jpg""BORDER=10>

Here's a view of what you see if you stand by my sliding glass doors:
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4633727221_c8f1a01154.jpg""BORDER=10>
There is a port hole from the living/dining room to the kitchen and we now use that counter place instead of the dining room table. 

Happily, the turtles were given a new home in the process of revamping the house.  They have their own table now instead of taking up half of our kitchen counter:
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4051/4633728287_3002807f9b.jpg""BORDER=10>

I picked up some place mats that matched our color scheme for the counter top:
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4633732927_0470255cac.jpg""BORDER=10>
And those stools are new too.

The devil's in the details:
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4029/4634333394_a5404d5c97.jpg""BORDER=10>

And this is the wall which used to house the DVD rack:
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3411/4633732227_816dd0c733.jpg""BORDER=10>
We bought one of these nifty cubby pieces which allowed for a lot more storage options, which we were severely lacking.  The empty wall is still missing a piece of art and possible cubby addition.  Not sure yet.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3370/4634324334_8223418ec9.jpg""BORDER=10>
And we got new computer desks courtesy of IKEA.  We needed something smaller than our old set up, so we settled on these sensible little tables and the cute little blue chairs. IKEA sells these boxes where you can store all your wires & I took full advantage of those clever little ideas.

</lj-cut>

And so there you have it, our living room.  Its not perfect, but I think its a lot more comfortable now than it used to be.  You've gotta be comfy in your home, right?
  
Larger versions of all the pictures are available at my flickr account (www.flickr.com/photos/pluckita/sets) in the Virtual Tour folder. I'd love to know what you guys think, so feel free to leave feedback :)

This post has officially taken 2 and a half hours to compose. I'm off to bed.

"event","For the past week, I have done everything possible to procrastinate on these meeting minutes that I know full well I have to do.  And now, on this fine Saturday night, I'm facing my final chance to get these minutes done in a timely fashion - which is especially important since I told my boss that I had completed them on Thursday - and yet, I'm sitting on Livejournal, writing a completely pointless entry.  There is something seriously wrong with my brain functions.

I have to post pictures.  I've kind of given my living room a make over and I have before and after pictures to share, but I'm too lazy to upload.  I'm considering holding off on the pictures until I've gotten all of my wall hangings up, but I'm impatient and excited, so chances are I'll post the incomplete versions.  I spent the majority of my day cleaning my condo.  I'm now tired and unmotivated.  Particularly when it comes to MEETING MINUTES. UGH.  I hate that part of my job. 

Speaking of my job, I have to report to it tomorrow.  This is the second consecutive weekend that I have to work.  I'm beginning to hate that. 

Right about now, I want to watch episode after episode of Criminal Minds.  I've been watching is in syndication on ION Television and A&E and I've grown quite fond of the show.  I'm always tardy the TV parties. 

OKKKKK, I'm going to force myself off of the internet.  This post had made zero sense.

Goodnight."

"event","First & foremost -- Happy Valentine's Day to any LJ readers left out there.

Today, my boyfriend was perfect, as always.  

He went in the morning to pick up the ingredients he was going to need to make me a yummy dinner.  He came back with a dozen red roses accompanied by an adorable look on his face as he fumbled with all the wrapping on the roses, lol.  When he got home, I ran out to the mall with Katherine to pick out a gift for him.  I had an incredibly busy week and didn't have enough time to get him something before today.  Kat and I had a great time at the mall. Not only did I buy boyfriend's gift, but I also bought Kat a few things.  She is my little Valentine too, after all.  

We came back from the mall and gave boyfriend his gift & as we had family cuddle/play time in the living room, the door bell rang.  It was a delivery for me -- Edible Arrangements chocolate covered strawberries and balloons -- my gift from boyfriend.  It was such a surprise.  He rarely does those kinds of things, so it was really special to me.  

JT came to pick up Kat shortly thereafter, so boyfriend and I took advantage of the free time and went to go see Percy Jackson and the Olympians.  When we got to the theater, there was this ADORABLE little old lady walking in, dressed to the nines in a red dress, dazzling white coat & diamond chandelier earrings.  She was struggling with the front door and the wind, so I hurried up to the door to assist her with it. From that moment on, I was totally enamored with the little lady.  I already love elderly people, but she was just particularly charming.  
After purchasing our tickets, I kept looking out for her to make sure she wasn't having trouble with any other doors, lol.  Once we entered into the theater, I spotted her walking toward the ticket collector, and from the right side of the entrance comes this equally adorable old man wearing a sport coat and leaning on a walker.  He walks right up to his date and she hooks her arm into his elbow, and they both hobble into their movie to commence their Valentine's date.  To say that my heart melted would be an understatement.  I was so touched, I started to cry, lol.  Boyfriend just squeezed my shoulder and said ""that's going to be us one day.""  I cried all the way to our seats, lol. Ridiculous, I know, but the whole scene gave me a major case of the warm and fuzzies. 

So, after the movie, boyfriend and I came & he commenced dinner preparations.  He made crab, potatoes and steamed broccoli, and everything came out spectacularly.  Kat made it home just in time to join us for dinner and watch the Disney Channel premier of StarStruck.  

All in all, I'd say it was a pretty spectacular day & just  reinforces to me how lucky I am to have the people I do in my life. I have no idea what I did to deserve them, but I'll never stop being grateful for having them.  

Back to work tomorrow & I'm wide awake, which is unfortunate.  I think its safe to say, though, that my chances of falling asleep would be a lot better if I'd close my laptop.

So, with that, good night.  I hope you all had a wonderful weekend :) &hearts;"

"event","So, I really want to sit down and construct a proper update, but I haven't yet found the time, the motivation or the pictures to put it together properly.  I could do it right now, but the rational side of my brain is yelling at the rest of it to go to bed.  I know that if I don't try to fall asleep soon, I'll regret it in the morning.  

I can't really remember what I last updated about or what gaps I left in the updates, but I know I haven't said a word since at least before the holidays, so there'll be plenty to share.  

I'm hoping that by posting this entry, I'll be a little more motivated to come back in and finished what I started.  So, with that said, I'm going to wrap this up and get in bed & then hopefully spend the entirety of tomorrow thinking about what I should post.

"event","My boyfriend made the family some hamburger helper for dinner :) I'm so proud! It came out delicious.  He's also making some dinner rolls in the oven as we speak, and he helped Kat do her homework.  He even let Katherine put a princess band-aid on his finger when she saw he had a booboo.  If that's not a fantastic hunk of man, I don't know what is. 

So, I got home from work a little late, but I think boyfriend and I are going to settle in and play some Aion.  We're trying the game out a little for a month, since the first month is free.  It was part of my early birthday present.  The second part of the present is Kingdom Hearts 3 (/squee) which I'm way excited to play.  Because he pre-ordered it for me, I got a KH poster and some postcards.  Love it, hehehehe/snort.

I honestly can't wait for the weekend.  I feel like that's all I focus on these days - the weekends.  Maybe its because I've had a lot to look forward to lately and will continue to have things to look forward to for the next few months.  Just this past weekend, I had a lovely night out with my dear friend Laura, who I've known since high school, and I got to have Sunday lunch with <lj user=""nuttandwhat""> and 2 other awesome girls.  Not only that, but Nut took me by this uhhh-mazing nail polish place and I think I'll be eternally indebted to her for sharing her trade secret, lol.  I burned through $50 at that place, and while I'm sure it bought more nail polish than I'll ever need in 3 lifetimes, I'm already itching to go back and look at more, lol.  You'd swear I was opening my own nail salon.  

In more somber news, kindly keep my brother's best friend Angel in your thoughts.  He's been like family to us since I was 10, and he got into a motorcycle accident today.  He's actually married to Kat's god-mother and they're both very dear to us, as are their 2 young sons.  Anyway, he's ripped all of the tendons and nerves from his right arm & its completely detached from his body.  There's a 40% chance that he'll lose it, but we're really hoping for the best.  I understand that there are risks associated with riding motorcycles, but at this point, that's water under the bridge and all we can do is pray for some sort of recovery that allows him to keep his arm. 

With that, I'm going to wrap up here, but I leave you with a stupid video of my dogs, whom I love so much.  I caught them on my flip cam the other night and I, personally, think they're too cute not to share.

"event","I can't even express to you all how happy I am that this week is over. It was a long one. 

Tonight, when I got home, I decided to surprise boyfriend & Kat with a trip to Ritter's ice cream and dinner at Applebee's. Because we kinda went to Ritter's first, I declared today BACKWARDS DAY!! Which really only meant that we could eat our ice cream first and then work on our dinner. This idea was a smashing success with Kat. Not only did she devour her Ritter's, but she annihilated her Applebee's chicken.  The grown-ups, on the other hand, felt pretty sick and stuffed after our little adventure.  We're clearly not built like we used to be. 
The wait staff at Applebee's found our idea to be rather amusing.  They were actually exceptionally pleasant tonight. As a matter of fact, I think there was something in the air tonight that had everyone in an extra friendly mood -- as we were driving to Ritter's, I was dancing & singing in the car. I know, I know. Plucky? Dancing? Yeah, dude, I totally was.  Actually, I shaking the car so hard with my moves, that the Ritter's girl caught me and she had a hell of a time keeping a straight face as she rang me up. Then, when we left, the boyfriend and Kat joined me in a completely off-key rendition of Boys Like Girl's Love Drunk.  It was pretty painful on the ears.  All in all, it would appear that everyone was in a good mood tonight; dare I say, silly? Yes.

Tomorrow, I take my munchkin to Disney on Ice. This is one of those moments where she needs to appreciate how awesome her  mommy is. I'm not joking. 

Speaking of the munchkin, the parent/teacher conference went well, as far as I can tell. Her teacher seems like a really nice lady and I appreciate the fact that she's keeping me in the loop whenever possible.  She said Kat's fairly behind on her reading, but I knew this already.  On Thursday night, I had a long talk with Kat and told her that if she doesn't start trying harder, we may have to keep her back a year.  We're going to re-address that issue closer to December/January, though.  

She did have her first spelling test today and we'd spent the better part of last night studying for it.  Hearing her go over her little words made my chest swell with pride. She seemed to be receptive to the whole learning thing that night, which is unusual for Kat. Typically, the minute she's challenged, she shuts down out of sheer laziness. So when she was actually getting them right, I was incredibly proud. I need to find some way to tap into her thought process so that I can make learning more fun and interesting. I need her to find her own motivation or she's never going to get through school because there's no way I can do this for her. 

Anyway, I think I'm going to try and work on my neglected fanfic for a while.  For once, I need to stick with something I've started.

Night!"

No, really, she went to a meeting at the county so I have at least an hour of freedom to update. -claps hands-

I'm having a day.  One of those where the smallest of things would probably frustrate me to bits & pieces if my brain were actually working. I can't wait to go home. Yesterday was another 7 pm departure and it seems like the day after one of those, I'm too tired to function properly.  It would also seem that I'm only capable of posting when I'm on the brink of exhaustion resulting in ridiculous and incoherent livejournal posts.  Either that, or I've just been nothing but exhausted lately, but its definitely one of those two...

Anyway, on with it.

Work has been busy, but I can't honestly say that there's been a time in the past year or so when work hasn't been busy for me.  I always seem to get on board @ these jobs and start asking for all of these responsibilities right off the bat.  Its really quite foolish to try to ""over achieve"" (for lack of a better term) in the work place, but, still I never seem to quite learn that lesson. Over achieving only gets you more work, less pay & a higher standard to live by.  One of these days, I'll learn my lesson, I'm sure.  Its a thankless world. 

Don't mind me, I had a hectic weekend and I still haven't recovered. I get cranky when I don't have recovery time.  I had to make 2 trips down to Miami this past weekend, which I absolutely hate doing. Ugh.  The first trip down was to see my friend Patty (who I adore) and pick out a dress for Kat to use in her wedding. We successfully picked out and purchased the dresses so the trip down was productive and Patty made it perfectly bearable.  At 5 PM, I had to haul boot[y] back to coral springs to attend this bowling fundraiser/sponsorship event with my boss & her husband.  Once that ended, I dragged the boy off to see a late showing of 9.  I only have one comment about that: the animation was nothing short of amazing.  Then on Sunday, I had to run back down to miami, but I got to have a late lunch with Daddy, so it was worth the drive. We went to my favorite thai place and had a grand old time.  Still, I got home at 9ish & by then, I was pretty drained.  Whatever. As they say, I guess I'll be able to sleep when I'm dead, no?

On September 17th, I have my very first parent teacher conference at Kat's school. I'm curious & concerned about why the teacher would need to meet with me so early into the year. I suspect it won't be good news.  I guess we'll just have to wait until Thursday to find out. Thursday at 7:30 AM. What a God-forsaken hour.   

As far as my schooling goes, I'm down to the last 15 days of this course & I am, of course, spazzing out. My ""professor"" (if you can call her that) e-mailed me this week to advise me of the option to ""buy"" more time on the course: three months for the low low price of $500.  Bargain, eh? /scoff. I might just end up doing it because its either that or lose the 7gs that my dad paid out on the course when we signed up. Its a no-brainer.  Still, it pains me b/c a.) I'm not that far from finishing and I know I won't need the entire 3 months & b.) I've been incredibly displeased with this course from the get-go. Its been nothing but problems. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.  But I guess you live & learn, right? 

I'm actually thinking about taking Kat to Disney on Ice again this weekend.  Well, the thinking part has mostly passed & I've pretty much decided to take Kat. She always has a good time there & it would be nice to have some alone time with her.  

Oh, i'd also like to mention that, finally, after 6+ years of marriage, 5 of which were spent separated(lol), I am actively in the process of a divorce.  Please, hold your applause. 
And if any nosy-non-friends still read this journal, I'm sure I can provide you with scumbag's contact info if you're interested so that you can, as you all say, ""hollar"". Right? Kids still say ""hollar"", right? Yeahhhh, I hear he's quite the catch these days, lol. Lol. LOL.
Sorry, I thought I might be able to type that with a straight face, but it didn't happen.  
My petition was filed last month and his answer was sent maybe a week ago so the ball is certainly rolling on this.  I can't tell you how happy this makes me.  its a pretty even split between happy & relieved, actually. 

Also in my good news category - Gossip Girl is back. Yay! It was a long summer without my favorite upper-east siders.  Gossip Girl + Moes Monday gives my life purpose.  Ha, just kidding. That's my little heathen's job. Dur. 

The next few months promise to be busy busy busy.  October is my birthday month & that's usually well-celebrated.  On Halloween weekend, I'll be heading up to NC.  Toss in there some holidays and baby showers and birthday parties & I'm booked. November is the New Moon premier! That's gonna be the highlight of my YEAR.  December, I'm heading back to NC with some cool chicks. I'm stoked. 

Stay tuned for birthday plans. I'm actually in the mood to socialize this year lol.
And in case I forgot to mention this -- my boyfriend is awesome. But that's not new news. 

Anyway, I better wrap this up before bosslady arrives. I already have the work she requested stacked in neat little piles & ready to go. I'm so efficient."

"event","In keeping with my posting trend -- I'm back to tell you all about my weekend! Woo. -twirls finger-

Actually, I had a really fun weekend. <lj user=""mentaldisarray""> made her way down to South Florida for a little visit, and even though I know she hates it here, I was really happy to see her, lol.  So I knew I had something to look forward to this weekend.

On Friday, I came home from work a little on the late side.  By the time I got home, I didn't want to do anything.  I basically just laid down, picked up my copy of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and read until my eyes burned.  Not the most exciting Friday night, but I was more than happy to waste my free hours away with my nose in that book.  

Saturday, plans had been made to go have lunch at the Cheesecake Factory.  I was to pick up <lj user=""mentaldisarray""> at 11:45 AM and drop off boyfriend in the process.  I made it to the pick-up location at 12:00 PM. which I'm sure didn't shock anybody because I'm notorious for being late to EVERYTHING.  But I swear it, it was Kat's fault.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it. 
Anyway, off we went to eat at Cheesecake at Sawgrass.  It was a whole group of us and it was SO MUCH FUN. I had a great time and it was really cool to be able to see everyone. Some people I hadn't seen in a year and others I hadn't seen in close to 5. Its so weird how time flies. One person I was actually meeting for the first time and she was a doll. All of the children in attendance were super well behaved, save for mine, lol. My little homie Jason & I got to talk about video games and that was all kinds of awesome.  I accidentally knocked over a huge glass of diet coke and bathed poor Julian. I'm fairly certain those kids thought I was outside of my mind by the end of that lunch.   Our waiter ended up being  a major snot-face, but that's okay.  We ate and sat around and talked, so he was just a minor inconvenience, at best.  At the end of the lunch, Emi made us all gather around for picture-taking.  She basically had us all stand there while the same photo was snapped 6 times, as she ran around behind us, changing positions, lol.  I found that to be rather comical.  

I somehow managed to lose my valet ticket but we were able to collect my car and get a move on toward the nail place by my house.  Natasha joined Emi & I on a quest to find a place where we could all get manicures and pedicures.  We first stopped by this place down the street from my condo complex and it turns out that its under new ownership.  I was completely floored when I walked in, lol. All the furniture was different and the staff was completely different.  It took me a while to register that this was no longer the same family that had been giving Emi & I our pedicures for the past 2 years (at least).  Emi sat down and had started to soak her feet, but after a second incident with the staff there & the spa chair, she got frustrated, dried her legs, had Natasha do the same and we all left, lol.  Yet another comical situation, but it may have been one of those things where you had to be there.

After checking 3 different places, we finally settled on this one random place that we spotted on the other side of 441.  It actually ended up being a really long experience, lol.  There was this motley crew of hispanic ladies that were doing the nails, and while they were extremely nice, they were also a little on the slow side. I think all 3 of us decided that we wouldn't be going back there again, lol.  

Please bear in mind that the entire afternoon, my child was acting like a complete heathen.  Thankfully, Natasha had endless patience when dealing with her, because Kat pretty much decided she wanted to wedge herself up Natasha's butt for the day.  
 
By the time we were all done w/ the nails and toes, Natasha had to leave us, so we said our goodbyes and Kat, Emi & I headed off to La Bambas to meet up with our respective men & her ""in-laws"".  Dinner was lovely and the in-laws were great but Kat continued to be a little heathen.  
By the end of the evening, boyfriend and I had been invited to a BBQ the next day over at their house, which was way nice of them to do. 

Come Sunday, boyfriend & I relaxed about the house until about 2:00 PM, which is when we headed off to meet Emi & Seth at the dog park.  The heat was pretty brutal and our dogs didn't last very long. By the time Emi & Seth came around with their doggie brood , our dogs were pretty much pooped and panting. We stayed there for a while, and as we left, I noticed our dogs were barely able to walk themselves to the car, lol.  Jeff & I decided to drive them by Ritter's for some doggie bowls.  They actually have soft-serve vanilla for dogs, which they top with a little dog biscuit. Its adorable to watch them eat it.  
After their ice-cream the dogs looked less overheated but ready for a nap never the less.  
At around 5:30ish, boyfriend and I made our way out to the BBQ. Again, another really fun time! The food spread was pretty outrageous and I ate like a complete pig. After a great dinner & some socializing, we went into this den area to play some Rock Band. There was an extensive selection of songs and I was the only idiot who was foolish enough to do the singing.  I sang myself hoarse as people picked ridiculous songs that they knew I'd sound stupid singing, lol. It was a loooot of fun though.  I'm eternally grateful to Jason for grabbing Katherine and keeping her calm and entertained for a long while. He was really excellent with her and I was beyond impressed. The whole night was great! Again, I'm thankful that they invited us over and were such gracious hosts and so incredibly generous with their food and their house.  It was great. 

At around 11 something, Jeff & I said our goodbyes and headed out. I came home and crashed in bed. Not sure why, but I've been tired all weekend, lol.  Anyway, today I was awoken at 7:30 AM by the dog trying to chew off one of my earrings and then sitting on my face.  I can think of better ways to wake up, but whatever, lol.  I took them out to potty and let Jeff sleep in a little.  I lounged around in bed with my face stuck in some Harry Potter again until about 2:00 PM. Actually, I suckered boyfriend into watching ""Win A Date With Tad Hamilton"" on TNT or something, so I watched that and would read during the commercial breaks, hah.  Once we got up, we got dressed and went down to Miami to visit my parents.  My mom made everyone pepper steak, which was delicious and she also surprised me with a Pandora bracelet! I love it. She started it for me and gave it to me in hopes that family would be able to give me more charms for my birthday. It was really sweet of her.  My daddy came by with some Spanish souffle and we all lounged around until about 7.  I just got home a little while ago and have actually been writing this entry ever since, lol. 

So there you have it - a recap of my uncharacteristically busy weekend.  I'm really hoping that the 4 day work week is a quick one.  That would be awesome. 

Anyway, I'm off to study. This entire post was really just another method of procrastinaion.  I seriously need someone to regulate on my behind. Ugh.

"event","I'm grumpy. 

And I can't help but be amused by people's reactions to my grumpiness, because people don't see a grumpy kristen all that often.  But that aside, nothing has been able to alleviate my grumpiness. 

I've been trying to pin down the source of my disgruntled mood, but I can't and that just ends up further aggrivating me.  I'm betting it has something to do with my lack of down time yesterday. I'm pretty sure I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, so it was no one particular event that triggered the grump. 

I managed to get Kat to school on time & arrived at work half an hour early. 
Someone asked me if I had gained more weight. Yes. Yes I have. 
I've gained a ton of weight and can't bring myself to worry about it right now with all the other things that seem to be happening at the same time. Namely this course that's looming over my head.
A HA! That's what it is....I'm stressed about this course.  
I think. I mean, I am. I know I am. Is that enough to make me grumpy? I don't know. I'm not prone to bad moods usually. 

I have stacks upon stacks, resting on stacks of work on my desk and my only impulse at the moment is to set them all aflame.  Yes. Excellent. 

I was giving some heavy thought to my future again and I think I may very well take advantage of the fact that my job will pay for half of my education.  It'll be health care related, but that would be fine. Another certification or degree can't hurt. 

I have a scab on the inside of my nose and I constantly get the urge to pick at it, but then I end up looking like I'm picking my nose (which I guess I kind of am) and it hurts to boot. 

Ok, back to creating convenient fire hazards on or around my work stacks. 
Byee.

"event","So, I promised I would come over here and write a post.  Here I am.
Sadly, there's a reason why I haven't been posting much & that reason issssss:
My life is overwhelmingly uninteresting.  

This entire week has been spent attempting to nurse Katherine back to health.  On Monday, she woke up with a mysterious fever but no other symptoms.  Knowing how her little system works, I took her straight to the pediatrician b/c if there's a fever, then an infection is sure to follow.  Unfortunately, I think we caught it too early and the doctor sent her home claiming that it was just a simple head cold.  By Tuesday night, the fever was still there and the poor little thing had lost her voice and developed a ferocious cough. At that point, I knew that even if it had started as a simple cold, it was now something more serious. So the boy took her to the doc again today and they were able to identify the sinus infection.  She's now on 10 days of antibiotics.  She's the only child I've ever met that actually likes drinking that pink medicine.   

I was able to stay home with her most of Monday and all of Tuesday, but there was no way I could get away with staying at home with her for another day.  Missing even one day of work usually results in this enormous backlog of stuff, and its nearly impossible to catch up once it gets too far gone. Case in point: today. I got to work at 9 AM and started my work immediately.  I left work at 8:30 at night and there was STILL stuff left to do when I left. I was (am?) pooped. I didn't even get a lunch break today - it was literally 11 & 1/2 hours of straight work with 3 bathroom breaks.  Needless to say, coming home was a real treat.  Of course, when I got home, I had to cook, lol. That's okay though, I made some angel hair & pesto for the family, stuffed some clothes in the dryer and sat down to watch Ghost Hunters with boyfriend. It could have been far worse. 

Unfortunately though, I didn't get any time to study for my paralegal course. I'm down to the wire on that course and I need to pick up the pace even more than I have been lately.  There's just no way I can fail it.  My marks have been good so far, but I'm definitely stressing the deadline. 

I'm really looking forward to the long weekend. Not only will I get some time to work on my course, but I'll also get to see and hang out with Emi! Boyfriend and I were supposed to head up to NC this weekend, but something came up and Emi and Seth had to come down to Florida instead.  Its going to be nice to see them.  I'm already working on rescheduling our trip up to NC for the end of October. I'd love to head up on Halloween weekend & bring Kat along.  I bet she'd get a real kick out of trick or treating in that area.  I'm dying to see some evidence of Fall and that'll probably be the only chance I get.  The more I consider the idea, the more I like it.      

So I've been doing quite a bit of reading lately and I'm wondering if I should set a goal for the year, like I see some people do. I don't think I need any motivation to keep picking up books, though. On most days, you practically have to pry the book out of my hands. At the moment, I'm zipping through the Harry Potter series & I absolutely love it.  When I'm done with the series, I'm going to start Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series (True Blood).  There are all kinds of rave reviews on the HBO series, but I don't have HBO, so I'll stick with the books for the time being. 

I do have Netflicks now though! And I'm actually getting some use out of it, shockingly. Last time I signed up for the service, I queued up one move, received it, held on to it for 5 months and kept forgetting to return it.  I cancelled the service shortly thereafter, lol.  Seems I've become a little more responsible in the years since then. 

On a completely unrelated note that I don't know where to place, I really want to see the movie 9. I can't express enough how much I love the fact that they used that Coheed song in the promos.  Gets me all hyped. 

I have a ton of pictures that I should post, but that's an awful lot of work & I think I've suffered through this post long enough. I've had a headache since 6 PM that the 2 Tylenol I took didn't even touch. 
Also, if this post lacks humor, creativity or coherency...that would be why. 

I will leave you guys with pictures of all of my babies :)

"event","I know I'm totally stating the obvious here, but Livejournal has been so dead lately :(
Everyone is busy elsewhere and there's nothing to read.  It saddens me greatly. 

I just got home from a mini-trip to Orlando. I took the boy to Epcot for his birthday/our anniversary.  We actually had a grand old time but I'm completely exhausted & sore.  Unfortunatelyh, while we were there, I didn't think to take too many pictures.  I don't think it matters too much seeing as how we were there just last month for Katherine's birthday & I did manage to take a ton of pictures then.  I'll get around to posting those one of these days, but not today. I'm feeling exceptionally lazy after this trip.  I still have to do laundry but I can't seem to move from my desk.  Who's going to break it to my boyfriend that he won't have any clean underwear for tomorrow? Its not going to be me...

I'm exhausted. We left at 8:00 am yesterday morning and hauled toosh up to Orlando to see if we could check into our hotel early.  We had brought the dogs with us and booked a room at the Holiday Inn Express, which is pet-friendly.  We arrived just in time to catch the shuttle service, so we dropped the dogs off in the room, crated them and then ran downstairs to ride to the park. Once we arrived at the park, we were all over the place.  We were able to fit in a few rides including Honey I Shrunk the Audience, Soarin' and the Figment ride before we went off to the countries.  When we got to the countries, the boy went nuts.  He went and sampled food at every affordable food spot he could find.  He was disappointed to find that the food there wasn't very authentic -- he was hoping to find less-Americanized food.  A little bit of shopping and a lotta bit of eating, and we were about done at the park.  We left at about 8 and went to the hotel and crashed.  The trip was a quick but enjoyable sojourn. 

The hotel was actually pretty decent considering how cheap it was. The shuttle service they use is a joke, though.  All of the nicer hotels have these nice, clean shuttles with TVs running. This shuttle had a matte aqua paint job on the outside, and the seats were torn up. The only thing adorning the inside were signs reminding riders to tip the driver. It only departed twice in the morning with three return options at night.  It was clearly the poor man's shuttle, lol.  It did the job though.
Its just funny to see how much a difference a few bucks make. 

Anyway, I'm going to join Mr. Jeff on the couch for some Full Metal Alchemist.  Maybe then I'll muster up the motivation to do the laundry."

    <p>So, this weekend, my child said something that I thought was too cute not to share. 

Yesterday, Kat and I got to work on cleaning her room. She has a nice, big room and its just filled to the brim with toys, a lot of which she doesn't actually use anymore. Its overwhelming.  Everytime she goes in there to play, she manages to make an epic mess out of all of her stuff and she doesn't know how to clean it up on her own. We agreed that we would take some time this weekend and put aside some of her old toys ""for the poor kids"". At first, her main concern was that I not give away any of her ""Hanni Tanni"" stuff. But yesterday, while we were cleaning, I asked her if we could place the toy I was holding into the poor kid pile, and she said 

""Mommy, why do you keep calling them the poor kids? You should call them the happy kids! They're getting all these new toys!"" 

And the way she said it was so aww-worthy, that I had to post it.  My kid has such a good little heart.

I spotted them one morning, coming off the elevator.  Someone used them to hang up a notice about swine flu.  I knew then and there that I had to have them.  

Thus started the week long reconnaissance mission.  I scouted the surrounding area daily, trying to pinpoint what the ideal hour of the day would be to nab them and replace them with a lower quality substitute. 
Finally, I could wait no longer...

This past Tuesday, I called a radio morning show, did my best Woody Wood Pecker impersonation and won a prize pack.  The end.  Well, I mean, I'm sure I could get a little more discriptive, but I think I'm going to hold off on that until after I get my prize pack from XM 20 on 20.  This most recent experience ALMOST compares with my Canadian radio experience, actually - though I'm not sure anything will ever trump that euphoria.  

When I used to work at the law firm - before the days of my ipod - I would listen to a Canadian radio station called ""The Peak"".  It would stream live on the internet and oh how I adored it.  After months of listening, I finally decided to e-mail my favorite DJ & let him know that The Peak had a fan in Florida.  Ten seconds after hitting the send button, the guy sends me a shout out on the air! Something like: ""I'd like to send a shout out to Kristen listening from Florida! Thanks for tuning in, we'd love to have you in Canada some time!"" I was absolutely tickled! I wanted to move to Canada right then and there. I'm pretty sure I called all of my family that afternoon and told them I was Canadian celebrity, or something equally ridiculous.   

Sadly, not long after that experience, one afternoon, I went to tune in to The Peak and I came to find that they had reformatted the station without warning. I was crushed and til this day, I'm still upset about it.  But long live the memories of The Peak!  Like Camp Anawanna, I'll hold them in my heart.

"event","Ackkk, what is this whole ad thing they've done to non-paid accounts? How incredibly annoying.  I thought you could choose between a regular account, a plus account and a paid account?

I need to renew my LJ time. For some odd reason, I'm not okay with having anything but a paid account. While I'm at it, I have to renew my flickr time too.  Thing is, flickr is worth paying for so much more than LJ is.  Regardless, I'll just renew both. 

So this past week has been eventful. I went on a mini-shopping spree for some new work clothes and I swear I feel as though I have a new lease on life. New York and Company was having the most amazing sale and I was able to completely revamp my work wardrobe for $200. I have 2 new suits, 2 new skirts, like 5 new pants and a slew of tops and sweaters.  I've been looking pretty sharp since wednesday, lol.  I'm generally not one to spend any of my fashion budget on work clothes, instead opting to mix up my weekend tees and tanks with some black or beige pants, lol. I'm such a mess at work. 

Aside from that, this week my mother made and finalized some plans for the upcoming long weekend. She ran straight to my dad and bamboozled him into agreeing to a weekend in St. Augustine before she'd spoken to me. Once she locked my dad in and made reservations, Jeff and I were locked into going ourselves. I can't leave my dad hanging like that and nobody wants to rock the boat with mom, so oh well.  I did kind of have plans for a baby shower that sunday, but when mom decides something, its her way or nothing. I now have the embarrassing task of letting Aimee (kat's godmother) know that I'll be out of town.  The only reason I hadn't made any other out of town plans for the long weekend was because of this shower. As a matter of fact, I had briefly discussed with <lj user=""mentaldisarray""> the possibility of another NC trip that weekend and didn't follow up on it anymore because of this shower.  My mother is truly something. 

But I can't even really bring myself to stress over vacation related stuff when there is so much going on at my workplace.  Something is amiss here and I can't pinpoint what. Its leaving me rather uneasy.  I have to kind of wait it out, but it still has me nervous and bothered.  I guess I've just got to stay on task and hope for the best.  I'll start ""staying on task"" promptly after lunch, heh. 

Kat's teacher called me yesterday to find out if I wanted to assist with the end of year field trip. I did manage to get clearance from my boss so that I'd be able to attend. I'm excited. I love doing those kinds of things with Kat. 

I made banana cupcakes last night with boyfriend. Actually, if it weren't for boyfriend's mixing skills, the cupcakes would not have been made.  Hand-mixers've got nothing on my boy. So I guess I didn't really make cupcakes at all -- boyfriend did.  Yay boyfriend! And yay cupcakes.  They're awesome. 

So now that I'm done scattering my thoughts all over the place, I think I'll get back to waiting for my food. 

Toodles."

"event","Its nice to finally be recovering from this sinus infection that I picked up last week. Today is day 5 of my antibiotic and I'm <i>still</i> not exactly all cleared up, but I am eternally grateful for regaining the ability to breathe through my nose.  Its one of those ""you don't know what you've got til its gone"" type things. 

While I'm here:
<b>HAPPY BELATED MOTHER'S DAY </b>to all of my glorious mommy-friends.  I hope you all got spoiled rotten. 

My mother's day was looking quite promising.  I had spent the whole morning preparing the condo for my mom to come over, as we'd planned.  I hand-painted a wooden picture frame in bright yellow and placed little wood letters that spelled ""mom"" on it in a deep fuschia color.  I hand painted and dipped the letters in glitter, because my mom likes sparkly things. Then I decorated the border of the frame with stickers from 5 different packs, all hand picked to match the frame's colors. It came out pretty awesome.  I put a picture of her, kat & I in the frame and then got to work on the customized garden step stone.  Kat and I were making a stone for her to add to her garden. The stone has a picture of kat in it and the stone is imprinted with ""abi I love you"".  Then, I filled out her card & had kat fill out the card she would give her. I bagged up the little mom-themed book that I buy her every year & the digital key-chain photo frame thing.  Once the gifts were set, I  made the from-scratch banana cupcakes with homemade frosting.  

At around 3, my mom called me.  In her very short manner, she proceeded to inform me that she was in a bad mood, her mother's day had been ruined and that she wouldn't be coming up to see me. She then hung up on me. 
Not knowing what I did or what to do, I sat & cried. And cried. And cried some more.  About 45 minutes of it.  By the time the tears were gone, so was my energy. 

At around 4 or 4:30, she called again.  She tells me she'll come after all. I told her that I'm not sure I want her to come anymore.  She acted as if she didn't hear that and told me she'd be here in about 2 hours.  Not wanting to fight with her, I said fine and hung up. 

When she got here, she acted as if nothing had happened. She gave me a hug and a gift and followed me inside. When I gave her all the gifts that I'd very nearly broken after her first phone call, she cried.  She said she loved them all.  The rest of the evening was spent eating cupcakes and humoring a very bossy Kat, who wanted all the guests to play tea party with her. 

So what was my mom's deal, you ask?  I'm not even sure I have the answer to that. 
Her sister-in-law (her deceased brother's wife) was having a luncheon.  She was going to do it at her house, but her septic tank blew, rendering her backyard unusable. So, of course, my mom ""lends"" her backyard to host the shindig. 
My aunt and her daughters, for the most part, are your typical, vapid Coral Gables psuedo-socialites, which I absolutely cannot deal with. Events with this side of the family are stiff and awkward and forced. All they like to do it gossip and feud and gossip some more about who's Gucci bag is real and who's is not and whether x y or z has gained 3 lbs.  Needless to say, I didn't want to attend this event, which consisted of 30 people I barely know, much less like.
My mother, on the other hand, did. So I told her that's fine, she could do that whole thing & we can get to the stuff I have planned when she's done there.  She agreed quite happily.  My mother loves to <i>keep up with thes jones'</i> and would give one of her limbs to be up in the mix with these people.  I know its a lifestyle she kind of envies (though she'll deny it) and she's forever looking for validation from these people.  

So the plans are set & I acted and planned accordingly. Tell me why my mom flipped out and got mad about my presence, or lack thereof, at this lunch? I guess I was supposed somehow know that she would change her mind about wanting me at the lunch? 
She said she was fine until she realized how big of a deal this lunch was to these people. People were dressed up and taking pictures and she was upset that I wasn't there and she looked all alone and abandoned.  
But still, why punish me for it? 

The whole thing was just amazingly upsetting, but I don't know why I expect any different from my mother. She does this kind of thing to me on every holiday. She's not happy on holidays unless I'm upset. 

And, on top of all of that, my child was being a demanding little snot.  She keeps picking up these awful behaviors from the kids at school and I'm really starting to hate it.  

But, on a brighter note: my cupcakes came out good, my boyfriend loves me, my daughter ended up finally saying happy mother's day, I found pictures I'd forgotten I had taken on my camera and I rearranged my living room.  That was all good news. 
This week, I'll tackle laundry & the bedrooms. Joy. 

Anyway, back to work. 
Byeee."

""Day started @ 4:30am. Dog pooped. Dog ate poop. Dog puked poop. Both dogs ate poop puke. Rinse & repeat. Result: angry kristen""

And that right there about says it all. 
Sorry for the grossness.  Trust me, nothing was worse then actually waking up to it, live & in progress.  Blech, disgusting.  

I had to hose everything down and toss it into the wash with copious amounts of detergent and softener.  I'll probably rewash it when I get home, just for good measure.  

But anyway, tonight I have a volunteer appreciation dinner at Kat's school for the whoppin' 2 times I volunteered for events this year.  I guess that's kind of a nice little thing they're doing.  its definitely an opportunity for me to maybe meet other parents in my area.  I'm not the most social human you've ever met, so these events are the extent of my ""networking"" in broward county.  

Anyway, I'm going to get to work on a big, long boring epic post recapping stuff. I guess.  There's not even that much to recap.  Truth be told, I don't post much because frankly, I don't think you guys find me all that interesting, lol.  & I'm really not.

"event","Well, my paralegal course certainly hasn't started with a bang.  Chapters are slow and boring and the assignments listed look like a piece of cake.  I wonder if its the course or if its actually the subject matter.  Either way, I'm feeling less excited and more impatient to just get the whole thing out of the way.  

My course literature hasn't arrived yet, so I was reading off the electronic version of the materials.  Maybe that's what threw me off. I have a hard time focusing if I'm not reading from a hard copy.  I kept wanting to stop my textbook reading and switch over to the screen with the unfinished manuscript of Midnight Sun.  

Bleh, I'll just have to keep plugging along, hoping that this gets better.  And its not that I dislike law, either. Quite the contrary, I've always enjoyed it and there was a time I wanted to practice it, but I can't deny that my heart isn't in it anymore.  I really want to get on with the classes that will get me where I want to go.  

Anyway, if I wish to remain employed, then I suppose I should get back to work.  Unless someone wants to call a bomb threat into my job? Ha, JUST KIDDING. Seriously, totally joking.  Don't do it.

"event","Here at the lovely almost-government institution where I am gainfully employed, non-exempt employees use this system called KRONOS to clock in and out and monitor their hours.  Its a phone system, nothing too sophisticated, really. 
I'm not feeling so hot today and I feel like I've been working the most insane hours lately, so I actually wanted to leave early this afternoon. I have a lot of things I should catch up on, and I have plenty of comp hours if my boss okays it, so it seemed like a good idea to just leave.  

So, I went into the KRONOS system a few minutes ago to check on my hours.  The last thing I want to do it short myself on hours just to go goof off on a wednesday.  I pull up my time card and it says I have an unexcused absense.  Wait, what? I haven't missed a day of work since like January.  That's definitely strange.  So I pulled up the pay period report and lo & behold there is nothing there.  Confused, I pull up last pay period and it only registers the 16th and 17th as worked. I pull up my absence report to confirm my suspicions, and it lists me as absent (unexcused) since 3/18/09.  That's a huge problem. I'm thinking that according to the system, I've basically abandoned my post.  Not to mention, tomorrow is pay day and per KRONOS, I've only worked 15.75 hours in 2 weeks.  Did I mention that my mortgage is due today? Hah.

So now, I'm insanely curious to know how they're going to fix this.  I worked loooong hours last pay period and I couldn't tell you how many even if I tried.  Do I lose my overtime?

I do have to say, he's come such a long way in the (almost) 3 short years we've been together.  He's grown into this great <i>man</i>. So much more than I ever could have asked for.

Professionally, he went from doing odd jobs like pizza delivery, bowling alley food stand clerk and above-ground pool installer (yes, he worked all these jobs simultaneously when I met him) to working in the healthcare industry and being promoted and making 5 dollars more (an hour) than when he started. All within 2 years of starting at the company. He's worked hard and established himself and I am really proud of him.  

Also to his credit, the kid has ""cojones"" (pardon my french. Er, spanish. Whatever).  He moved down to Florida with nothing - no family, no friends, no connections, just me - and he's done so well for himself. 

Anyway, I just wanted to say all of that, lol.  He does me proud.  I heart him."

JT is jobless and has been this way since before October? I think.  Whatever, no major shock there.  He's typically in a perpetual state of unemployment.

The last Sunday he had Kat, he handed me $80 and told me it was from a job he had done that Saturday. This would be the first cash I see from him since like last September. I said okay, thanks. Whatever.

Well, I just got a call from JT's mom asking if he gave me the money she had given him to pass along to me.  I explained that I'd gotten $80 from him, which he claimed came from a job that he'd done, and that any additional money was news to me.  She was uuuuupsetttttt.  Apparently, in addition to this work money he had, his mother gave him $120.  $20 of that money was for him to take as gas, and the other $100 was to come to Katherine.  I never got that money.  He had claimed that the $80 he had given me was the money he made at the job.  According to JT, he made $100 total at the job, and he had to use $20 of the job money on gas, so the $80 he was giving me was ALL HE HAD.  Yeah.  There's $120 given to him by his mother that is totally unaccounted for.  Savvy?
I know this all sounds like a bad word equation & I apologize.  

The bottom line?  He stole money from my daughter. 

Really though, stealing money from a 5 year old that shares your DNA? I think he's sunk to a new low."

"event","Well, I'm long overdue for an entry. I keep getting sidetracked by one thing or the other everytime I sit down to write.  First things first, I'm two weeks late on writing about my vacation to North Carolina, which is pretty weak of me.  So here goes...

The boy and I went to North Carolina and we hated it.  The end.

Haha, just kidding, Emi. 

Let's start from the beginning, shall we?

Friday morning, I woke up super dooper early for a sponsorship meeting here at work. I was actually at work about an hour early, 8:00 a.m., so that was fun and exciting.  I worked and worked and before I knew it, it was 7:00 pm.  That kind of sucked because I had told my boss that I needed to leave on time to make the 12 hour drive up that night. Yes, that's right, the boy and I were actually going to attempt an all-nighter, neither of us sure that we would actually make it.  So, I headed home, and my dad is there, waiting for me. He was doing me the tremendous favor of picking up kat so that jeff and I could head straight north, instead of 45 minutes south to leave her at my mom's.  So I pack everyone up, and before we know it, its 8:30ish.  Jeff and I load up my car, with dog and all, and we head out.  10 minutes in, jeff is hungry, lol. We make a stop for dinner, and we're finally on our way.  At around 11 or 11:30, jeff gets sleepy, lol. So he lays back and takes a nap. Me? I'm already dying to lay my head down, and we're only about an hour and a half in. This is definitely going to be a rough ride.  
So boyfriend naps while I blast the most obnoxious music I can find on my satellite radio at full volume to keep me awake.  At around midnight or 1 am, he wakes up and decides to string himself out on caffeine to stay awake.  We end up staying  awake together until about 3:30 am, which is when I decided to hand over the keys so that I can take a cat nap.  We gas up and keep moving.  I finally fall asleep around quarter til 4, and before I know it, I was getting shoved awake again by my darling boyfriend who was experiencing a caffeine crash, lol.   I took back the wheel at 5ish or so and kept us moving. The hour or so between 5 and sunrise was absolute agony. I wanted to pass out.  Once the sun was up, I was fine.  We ended up breezing through the remainder of the drive with the help of the now-trusty TomTom, who led us there quite effortlessly.  We arrived just shy of 12 hours after leaving margate -- about 9:45 saturday morning or so.  So we hop out of the car looking like poo twice-run-over, and our gracious hosts allow our darling dog to pee on their concrete, and puke and poo in their yard.  The pup then proceeds to annoy thr everliving hell out of mr. Corgi and just wrecks over-all havoc for a while.  Emi then gave me the grand tour of her absolutely gooooorgeous house.  I was totally impressed by her stellar decorating skills.  Seriously, though.  It all looked effin awesome.  Once the grand tour was had and the luggage was moved into our comfy guest room (which, by the way, was nice and toasty with a comfy bed), boyfriend and I took turns showering.  I accidentally used up a good majority of the warm water :(.  And by good majority, I mean all.  So I was clean, hair washed, teeth brushed and dressed, in other words - no longer looking scary.   Once again presentable, we all headed out to lunch at this absolutely delicious place. I think the name was O'hares? I'm not sure. The food was yum and the service was fantastic.  In NC, they actually have the cleanliness rating of restaurants on the walls, and this one had a high one, lol.  
After lunch, the rest of the day kind of bleeds together a little. That might be due to the fact that I was well over my 24 hours awake mark, with the exception of my hour nap.  I know we grabbed some starbucks, went to Petco to buy some sweaters for penelope and then I think we did wal-mart, to pick up rations for the cook-out we were doing in the back yard.  Then, I know Emi and I somehow ended up at my new favorite place, Garden Ridge, where we proceeded to shop until the place closed its doors, which was at around 9 pm.  What a freakin' awesome store that it. I think I would move to NC just to be able to shop there regularly. Jesus.  I might have even enjoyed it more if I hadnt've had to use the potty really bad the whole time.  I was practically tango-ing across the store trying to hold it.  Next time, I'll listen to Emi when she tells me to go before we leave the house, lol.  I have the bladder of a kitten.
Once we'd shopped our little hearts out, we went to pick up supplies for smores.  We headed back to the house and had our delicious cookout.  The only problem with the cookout? IT WAS REALLY REALLY COLD OUTSIDEEEEE. But that was a problem for me the entire vacation, really. Lol.  So, we ate, we inhaled tons of fire pit smoke -choke- and we kind of failed at roasting marshmellows. I set one on fire by accident, too.  By about 12 am, it was time for bed and I had officially been awake for a really long freakin' time.  I slept like a baby.  
Sunday morning, I'm up and adam early. We decided to just have bagels for breakfast/lunch to save ourselves for cheesecake factory that night.  That was dumb of me, because I was literally ready to eat my own hand by about 2 in the afternoon.  Poor Emi woke up with a horrible migraine that morning, so I just lounged around in the man cave with the boys while they played video games and I watched. Relaxing day.  I was snuggled up to poor dottie for warmth down there.  I'm definitely not used to the subarctic temperature in the downstairs of the house.  Once Emi was feeling better, we all made our way to the cheesecake factory for Emi's birthday dinner which was a good move for the well-being of the other occupants of the house. I was almost ready to commit an act of cannibalism at that point.   Once again, dinner was yum and the service was excellent.  Seemed to be the standard in NC.  Emi's lucky we were all stuffed because I was about to gather the wait staff to sing their loudest, most obnoxious rendition of ""happy birthday"". We came home after dinner and played CLUE!! That was so much fun.  I won the first game, but gave away my strategy, like an idiot.  I was like the villain in a bad movie or cartoon, explaining my genius evil plot to the hero just before he foils my plan.  Yeah, like that. I totally didn't win after that.  I love that game, though, and I loved it even more playing it by Emi's fireplace. It was conducive to the mysterious mood. 
On monday, emi and I made it another shopping day! We went to the salvage place, this candle store, this furniture consignment shop and back to Garden Ridge.  I bought something at every. single. place. Except for the furniture place.  I was so bad.  Its a compulsive shopping habit, really.  We also got to eat some delicious Cracker Barrel without the grumpy boys complaining about the place.  I looooove their food. And yes, I bought something there too :(
For dinner, we got treated to the world famous Jimmy's BBQ, since we were in the BBQ capital of the U.S.  that was some gooood BBQ (thanks guys!). I've been wanting some lately :( I've never had such tender pork. Mmm.  After dinner, we all sat in the cave and watched Valkryie.  I was literally sitting on that couch in full outer wear the entire time.  I don't think there was any point in the vacation where I was actually warm aside from bedtime.  I'm such a punk.
Sadly, on tuesday morning, the boy and I had to wake up early to head home. There was frost on my car that morning! Which was kind of neat.  We fired up the tomtom and made our 12 hour trip home.  That was uneventful.  

Soooo, we had an awesome time and we got to stay in a great place (thank you for having us!) And NC is totally gorgeous, of course. Even in the winter with the dead trees, its a sight to behold.  The people were nice and happy, lol.  They totally have ""Carolina blue skies"", which Emi is an expert on, lol. And the neighbors, they just walk up to you and say hi and do a meet-and-greet between dogs. Its definitely a different atmosphere.  Its quite lovely, really.  And of course, it was endlessly entertaining watching Penelope annoy Ein. Even eith his subsequent barking. 
I suspect that jeff and I will be making the trip up again sometime. Hopefully sooner than later, so if our hosts don't mind the houseguests, I think NC in the fall would be amazing."

Anyway, I'm completely procrastinating on this task my boss has given me, and this entry has given me a pretty solid excuse to put off work for a little while longer.  I don't even have anything I really want to say, but who cares?  After I'm done here, I'm going to grab my markers out of my second drawer and decorate my calendar. I had originally told myself that I would color after I finish my filing - as a treat - but I don't think I'm going to be able to resist the temptation.  Life is so hard sometimes.  

So, tomorrow after work, I'll be embarking on a 12 hour car ride to go see <lj user=""mentaldisarray"">.  I'll have the boy in tow.  We're both supremely excited to a.) see our friends b.) get out of town & c.) not have to work.  We had originally planned this trip for last weekend but my boss sprang a last minute change on me, which left me a little bitter >_< not gonna lie...
But either way, its worked out fine.  Maybe better, even.  They got to enjoy their valentine's day and we'll be there for Emi's birthday weekend! Yay! And we already have activities planned and all of that good stuff.  Now all that's left is packing and surviving the 12 hour car ride with the dog.

Oh, yeah, I never got around to posting this, but we've added a dog to the family! She's been with us since my birthday last october.  Her name is Penelope, she's a 7 month old Boston Terrier.  She's made of win. Seriously.  She's adorably expressive, incredibly intelligent and bordering-obnoxiously playful.  She's also easily one of the most spoiled little pup's you'll ever meet. She's about as pampered as any of the humans in the house are.  I'll have to add her to the ist of things I owe pictures of.   

Ya know, I've suddenly lost the urge to update, lol.  Its been replaced with the overwhelming urge to work.  Freudian death instinct? Maybe. 

I'll finish later."

"event","Greetings from my new white tmobile G1! 
I gave into my dark side and bought the phone. The other phone made me so miserable.  I had get rid of it.  I know that sounds terribly bratty of me, and maybe it is a little ridiculous of me to care so much about something so trivial, but oh well.  I use my phone enough where that kind of thing matters.  

Anyways, I wanted to thank you guys for the feedback you provided. I absolutely adore the phone. Its awesome.  I should have gotten it back in november when I had originally planned.  Wait, actually, it worked out better this way because the white one wasn't available in november and part of the reason I love the phone is the color.  So yeah -- bottom line is:  I heart the phone. 

Anyway, enough of that.

I hope you guys had a great weekend. Mine was filled with warcraft holiday achievements, sushi, cleaning and boy-cuddling.  Congratulations to all the Steelers fans out there on your Super Bowl bragging rights.  My condolences to the Cardinals fans out there (that is assuming that any of these mythical creatures do, in fact, exist).  The Cards put up a good fight, they deserve e-daps.  

I need to get some pictures up of my toothless wonderbaby. She's so effin cute. 

Anyway, I'm wrapping up this entry. Take it easy, guys.
Toodles."

"event","My phone hates me. 

I swear to you, if I didn't know better, I would say that the little eff-er conspired against me yesterday.  

I was at work, and I'd actually gotten livejournal working on the horrible internet connection from my phone.  I load up to write an entry about my phone and how much I dislike it and how disappointed I am with the purchase.  I hit the post button, and all of a sudden, the phone stops cooperating.  I tried hitting the ""post"" button at least 18 times before the phone locked me out of the webpage.  When I hit another button to navigate back, the phone shut off.  I had this whole long entry done and ready, and I was never able to post it.  I personally think the pig-headed piece of garbage knew that I was talking about replacing it, so it rebelled.  

Anyway, what the original post was saying was --
I hate that stupid phone.  I should have gone with my gut and bought the G1 while I had the chance.  What I'm asking you fine folks is: Do any of you own the G1? Is there anyone out there willing to make a personal recommendation? If so, I'll consider buying it on ebay.  I'm a tech freak and I can't, in good conscience, use a phone that I despise.  So, any opinions are greatly appreciated. 

On a non-tech related note:
I'm sorry I've been such a one-sided LJ friend lately.  I've been reading journals fairly regularly, but because of the stupid phone's poopy connection, I have a hard time commenting.  I also never have time to post.  It may seem like I've been lost, but I've totally been watching.  And that sounds really creepy.  Eep. Sorry. 

I promise I'll pull together an entry one of these evenings.  Not only is my LJ neglected, but my house is a mess, my dishes need to be done and my laundry is starting to pile.  I'm really behind on life.  
The bright side: I've finished 2 books in 4 days and I now have a Barnes and Noble membership.  I think I'm on a reading kick.  
But all of that is for a later entry.

Anyway, its way past my bed time.  I'm too old to stay up past midnight :(

G'night!

"event","I'm having THE WORST pop-up issues EVER. I don't know what to do. I'm leaning toward reformatting my computer, but I wouldn't even know how to do that on this PC. 

I've switched to FireFox, I've downloaded anti-virus and spyware programs; you name it, I've done it.  I""m so frustrated.  No matter what I do, they still freakin' pop up.  I hate it.  Someone advised against paying money for an anti-virus software.  They said it wouldn't help enough to be worth it.  I wouldn't really know how to operate it anyway. 

UGHHHH. 

Anyone have any suggestions?"

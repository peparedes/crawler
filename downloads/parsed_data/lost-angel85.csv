Work today was..well it was work. it was a pretty good day, thanks to Sarah, Im glad she worked today or it may very well have SUCKED. and I'm glad Sheri came back. there are days when I like it and there are honestly days when I hate it.

there is just something about certain people and the way I feel when I am around them, like I'm at home. its weird. i love those people <3

i feel really gross and fat.
i need to lose weight.
i cant wait for tomorrow to be over...
i have to study but i want to sleep, but i also want to go jogging. 

I NEED MORE TIME.

sheri im wearing the red shoes tomorrow. going to ""break them in"", i'll take pics. 

sorry for being so distant, and unapproachable. I have an attachment problem, i dont want to miss you when youre gone. i dont even want you to go.

"event","<sigh> well today was a very long day, but it wasnt too bad. I'm just tired from last night, my adventures of getting kicked out the club and freezing my ass off for like almost an HOUR! lol oh well, it was fun! James worked today :) that was cool, i like working with him...and Stephen, i love him hes just so fun, and a really cool guy! oh and of course i cant forget RAMI!!! hes the best, really sweet kid. and Sheri worked also..in the stand..and other people that i dont care too much about worked, oh wait i lie Jess worked ( MY HOMO!! lolz)

i guess there are some things that will never change, and some people as well...
i know it takes a long time for some people to grow up, but c'mon you can't be that dense, that naive to think that you're superior to the rest of us. 

YOU ARE A NOBODY.

NOTHING.

NADA.

ZIP.

get over yourself. i have.

its okay to laugh, and snicker, and poke your fun. but you just remember this one thing...while youre laughing behind my back now, i'll be laughing in your face one day, you'll see.

i love the attention...i really do. I want more...morE...moRE...mORE...MORE!!!

"event","What do you do when you love someone so much and youre unsure despite the many times they tell you if they love you too?

What do you do when all you want to do is cry and the tears just won't fall? 

What do you do when it feels like everyone around you is moving so fast, and you're just standing still? 

What do you do when it hurts so bad you just want to make all the pain stop?

How do you explain your life after death?

Why is it that nobody can hear you when you have a million things to say, but everyone is listening when youre speechless?

why is it so hard to be me?

"event","So today is like quite possibly the lamest Sunday ever...i switched with idiot Josh so that I could do something this afternoon which I never even ended up doing {scoff} soo yeah im pretty pissed about that cuz now I have to work in Projectin tonight and there is NO radio (thanks to homo Jason) and umm yeah I have to work with Gordon...yaye...fun?! NOT! ugh today sucks.

Last night at work was pretty funny though, lol I was sooooo tired I was kinda going off the walls. I kept laughing and making funny sounds and jokes haha Gordon was cracking up, and I made Ryland laugh a little too. 

After work Mel & I went to Boca Ale House for a drink, it was cool. she hadn't eaten anything so she was feeling he liquor a little bit. I just had one beer, Corona w/lime...yum! I never used to like beer, but that just like most things, you tend to aquire a taste for them. 

Hrm...I think some cool ppl work tonight, though I'm in frickin booth so it doesnt matter to me, but at least I get to see them when I get there and thats cool. plus i have like an hour break @ 8pm so I can always go say whats up if they are still there. However I think I may have to do inventory tonight YUCK!! so I might be stuck with that. omfg plus i have a butt load of hmwk to do...ughh!!! the weekend isnt long enough I swear...life is totally over packed with too much to do and not enough time to do it all. 

I JUST FEEL LIKE SCREAMING!!!!!!

w/e it's 4:02, I have to be to work by 6:00...I'm already showered and ready, just got to change my clothes...so I pretty much have an hour and a half to sit here and do what i do best, absolutely NOTHING. 

hate to say it cuz sumtimes i dont, but i miss high school. even though everyone was so fake at least you had ppl around you, though sometimes its better to just be alone. 

I'm going to be alone, forever.

bleh...im boiling eggs to make egg salad let me go check on them, I think I've done enough journaling for today.

I can't stand being torn in two...trying to please everyone around me and please myself as well. It's not what I plan my days out to be like. I'm so tired of smiling for the sake of others. Let me frown, let me cry, let me be silent and stay to myself. I have a very contemplative mind, I can shout to the world how I feel or let my feelings been seen through the expression on my face and the glaze of my eyes. Life isn't perfect, nor is it fair, so why should I prance around on broken glass for everyone? Nobody does it for me...

I'm not Miss. America, never won anything for being pretty, stop putting me on this peddistool like I'm an unwritten about Goddess. I don't need the spot light, I don't need the attention, I'm content with being me, being average, being plain, being simple, being sexy in MY OWN WAY, not worrying about what size I wear, based upon the twigs on the covers of ""Cosmo"" or ""Elle""...I'm tired of looking in the mirror trying to see what all of you see. I don't see anyone special or amazing or magnificant, don't see anyone great or perfect. I see me, simple & plain, not cocky or vain, just me.

Love saved my life. I owe everything I have and ever will have to Love. To being Loved, to being In Love, to seeing my Love, to being seen by my Love. To shout to the world that I have a Love. This Love is my Love; It's a good Love; A special Love; A Love that I would Die for; A Love that I can not live without. It is a Love that will bend the rules of Love. The strongest Love of all. It's the Love I have for myself...Because nobody can or will ever Love me more than I Love myself, no matter how hard they try.

*I can't imagine my life without...


~ Seeing him is like breathing, I need to do it to survive ~ (Me)

*I could write a book, but to bore you with my life would be like reading a story about you...because no matter what anyone says you & I both know that we're all alike, don't try and pretend you're better, it only makes me laugh!*

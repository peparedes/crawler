"event","<i>Things you enjoy, even when no one around you wants to go out and play. What lowers your stress/blood pressure/anxiety level? Make a list, post it to your journal... and then tag 5 friends and ask them to post it to theirs.</i>
<lj-cut text=""b's list"">
1.  Sleeping.  I don't always sleep very well, so I like to take a nap now and again - which only makes the nights even worse...so I get tired and take a kip and then I can't sleep when night comes........  Meh.
2.  Reading detective/police stories (preferably British or Scandinavian).  American crime stories always refer to people as hookers and junkies, and that's off-putting - it says a lot about how people are viewed in the respective culture.
3.  Driving and listening to music, preferably my brother's downloaded CDs. Since I don't have a CD player on my own I only get to listen to music in the car.  :(  I can listen to the DVD, of course, but it refuses to accept burned CDs - bloody machine.
4.  Paying bills.  The best stress relief there is, except for the fact that my bank account suffers.
5.  Watching good stuff on TV, preferably documentaries.  Marine life, wildlife, paleontology, biology, natural history, medicine, and the occasional disaster.  ""What if""-scenarioes are also interesting.
6.  The sea.  Just hanging around, watching, walking on the beach.  Occasionally fishing, but I rarely get into a boat - I don't have one, neither does anyone I know.  :/
7.  Surfing the nett.
8.  Buying stuff for J.  
9.  Getting drunk.
10.  Playing billiard/pool.

"event","<lj-cut text=""Dog shows"">
I thought the dog show up north would take place the last weekend of June...I was wrong.  It's the last weekend of July.  I hate being wrong.  Seems to be an outdoor show - something I'm not too fond of; outdoor shows means nowhere to sit, and the breeders will retreat to their little tents, making it more or less impossible to strike up a casual conversation.  And I need it to be casual at the start, otherwise I get nervous, can't get a bloody word out, and end up walking around in the outskirts of the grounds, feeling sorry for myself.  For some reason I can't manage to give a good first impression no matter how much I try.  How other people do it I will never know.

Maybe I should just contact that breeder again.  She seemed like a nice person, and her dogs look great.  *sigh*

Have decided to cut my hair - it's nearly halfway down to my oversized ass by now, and I'm fed up with finding long curly hairs everywhere.  Maybe I should post a ""before and after"" picture."

All right.  This will be the six favourites <i>right now</i> then, 'cos these things change every other day.  But they're good...
<i>
Led Zeppelin- Rain song
Johnny Cash- Hurt
Johnny Cash-  When the man comes around
Nick Cave- The carny
And a couple of techno pieces that my bro downloaded for me, but I have no idea what they're called.</i>  I can always find out later.  Yeah, I love techno - shoot me.  I won't tag anyone...instead take it if you want, it's interesting to see what people like when it comes to music.  Looking at my list of favourites would tell anyone that I have no bleedin' clue when it comes to new music.  IMO they stopped producing good music somewhere in the late nineties...

Got a new stove today.  Well, maybe not new, but it's from 1990, instead of 1980 like my last one - and in 2015 I'll get one from 2000.  I'm always fifteen years behind on these things.

I have some mails/comments/posts to reply to...but please, forgive me.  I'll do it tomorrow.  Now, I'll go watch <i>The Shining</i>."

I know exactly what he's talking about here.  I can't explain it - but it's this heavy feeling that always seem to be a part of our lives.  Not quite sadness, I think the word he's looking for is melancholia.
Maybe it's the closeness to nature, the fact that our people used to live few and far between, often left to the whims of mother earth?  But that could also be said about many other countries...  Maybe it's the darkness in the long winter?

Have I talked about this before?  Oh, never mind."

"event","My mum had a friend once, O.  Actually, he used to babysit me sometimes when I was a toddler.  *thinks back*  I was pretty surprised to see him in my class when I started college...  :)  He's cool.  Mum and him are still on friendly terms, even though they don't have that much in common any longer.

Why am I thinking about O?  Well, he was a breeder and judge of Cavaliers and King Charles Spaniels; only last year J and I went to look at his last litter, a pair of black and tan King Charles girls.
Thing is I'll get some tax money next year (I pay more tax now than I have to...deliberately - an effective way of saving up holiday-money), and I may end up buying a dog.  A bitch, I've decided, and I have four breeds I'm looking at.  Will spend a couple of days this summer/autumn going to shows, just to look, while J is at Gran's place.  That way I can talk with breeders and owners and maybe get a few connections (and of course just enjoy being in a show environment again).  The first show will be the last weekend in June, up north, in my ""old"" town so if I'm lucky I can stay with an old aquaintance.  B perhaps.  :)  That'll be fun."

<lj-cut text=""A little 'bout OCs and songs"">
<b>1) Do you ever take inspiration fron real life people when you write your OCs?</b>
Both yes and no.  I think it's mostly situations I use.  A friend of mine, B, went to see a buddy of his one time, but the buddy got sick and ended up in a hospital.  My friend then got the message that the buddy's parrot had died, and he wanted B to bury it.  He also told him that he'd bought a steak that he planned to have for dinner - could B please put this in the freezer?  So B went over to his place, put the plastic bag in the freezer and another plastic bag in the ground.  ""So long, parrot.""
Then the buddy got out of hospital, he came home and found his dead parrot in the freezer.  My friend had buried the steak in the back garden.

Now, to be honest, B can be a bit...creative, so he probably looked in the bag first, saw the parrot, and decided that it'd make a good story.  But absurd little situations like that is something I borrow from time to time (and hope to God it isn't nicked from some obscure TV-series).  There's quite a lot of B in my version of Dung Fletcher, actually.  I've never thought 'bout that before...

I can take the idea of an OC and think of a particular person, but usually the OC morphs into a person of his/her own after a couple of pages.  If s/he doesn't, I have a problem, because I'm not fond of ""forcing"" the characters to do things that doesn't feel natural - and that often disturbs the plot of the story.

<b>2) What is the first thing you do when you wake up?</b>
Curse my fate and bite people's heads off.  I'm not a morning person.

<b>3) Is poetry better than fiction?</b>
No.  They both have their uses, there are things you can say in, or with, a poem that you can't say out loud just like that - for instance when it comes to love.  Love is a big word (at least in my language/culture), almost a bit threatening sometimes, and to tell the truth it makes me slightly uncomfortable.   With poetry one can express these feelings without making it sound too weird.  
Am I making sense at all?  :/
But also, poetry can be stiff and awkward, at least when I try to write it.  I'm no poet myself, and most of those who consider themselves to be poets make me grin.  When it comes to poetry, I'm a hard critic.

<b>4) What song means the most to you?</b>
Impossible to choose.  It depends on how I'm feeling at the moment.  It's all melancholy stuff, 'cos I'm melancholic to the core.  Bob Dylan's Mr. Tambourine Man is one-
Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.

Or Jethro Tull's Heavy Horses, because it moves me so incredibly much.  I actually start crying when I hear this song - it's embarrassing as hell and I'm not sure why.  Maybe because I see myself as one of these heavy horses that no one has use for anymore.

Standing like tanks on the brow of the hill
Up into the cold wind facing
In stiff battle harness, chained to the world
Against the low sun racing
Bring me a wheel of oaken wood
A rein of polished leather
A heavy horse and a tumbling sky
Brewing heavy weather.

There are a dozen others.  I can't choose.

<b>5) What is is about people in general that you would like to change?</b>
People don't change because of what anyone tells them.  It has to come from the inside, or it won't come at all.  
If I <i>could</i> I would make people more open minded, make them use their brains instead of just quietly accepting each stereotype and ""truth"" they're being fed since birth.

Well, perhaps the song will grow on me.  If I bother to give it a shot, which I doubt.  
Moldova did good, though.  But not <i>one</i> single point from Norway?  One should've thought they would get at least five (considering how many times I called...).  Meh.  Not quite satisfied with this outcome - but then again, that's tradition."

"event","Just read <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/xylodemon/232778.html"">this post</a> and the replies to this post completely rubs me up the wrong way.  Honestly, I'm not sure if I should write this - it's late, I'm cranky, and I've got a headache.
Thing is, I write stories that are centered around OCs.  This is because I find Rowling's universe interesting to play in, and if I only had the canon characters to write about I wouldn't write fics.  I do it because I find pleasure in creating something of my own within this set universe. 

Does that make me a lesser fan than the rest of you who stick to writing Weasleys and Malfoys?  

<i>Why don't you write your own stories?</i>
1) No one is interested in reading fiction from an unknown writer.  
2) I like to play with Rowling's universe, as I already stated.
3) I like to keep in touch with the rest of the fandom.
4) I want people to realise not all OCs are Mary Sues.
5) The place I'm most interested in, Knockturn Alley, <b>can't</b> be written without OCs.
6)  I AM writing an original story, but I have a fic I want to finish.

And I want to shout this from the friggin rooftops...but what's the use.  If people aren't interested I can't make them change their minds - I'm not a speaker, I'll only end up looking the fool.   I can rant about it here, which won't change anything.  There's a lot of snobbery in this fandom, and it's a big turn-off.

I'll stop spamming now and go to bed like all decent folks do."

<lj-cut text=""In which bruno rants about drunken foolishness and pets"">
<b>1. When did you start smoking and why?</b>
I was twenty-two and sharing a flat with a roommate.  She smoked quite a lot of weed, and wanted me to try it.  I did, and got a very nice kick out of it - but the kick faded after only a few minutes.  That's when I realised that it was the tobacco that gave me the kick, not the weed - so while they smoked bongs and shit I nicked a few cigarettes instead.  Some people get sick when they smoke for the first time, I didn't.  Took me a while to like the weed, but the tobacco I enjoyed from day one.  (No, I'm not telling the kids to start smoking - just stating how I personally felt.)

<b>2. What's the most embarassing thing you've done while drunk? And do you remember it?</b>
Only too well.  Half of it anyway.  
I'd fallen in love with this man - one of the most brilliant men I've ever met; tall, blond, a real viking through and through and with the sharpest mind this side of Volga.  I followed him around, laughed at all his jokes, pinched his butt when I could and was a general pest (I was in my early twenties back then, he twenty years older).  But, strangely enough, he put up with it!  He ruffled my hair, patted me on the back and generally acted like a nice uncle.  I think he considered me as some sort of pet.

Well, anyway...  I was hopelessly in love, I would've killed for this man.  But he wasn't interested <i>at all</i> which was pretty hard to swallow.  One night I was out drinking and I got angry.  So I went up to his house to declare my undying love, but I had to stop by each and every pub on the way up.  In the end I was so plastered I couldn't walk straight, but that didn't matter - I went anyway.  Standing outside his door my nerves started acting up again, but I knocked anyway.  It was in the middle of the night...he was sleeping of course.  Then his dog started barking like mad, and I heard his shout at it to be quiet...and I ran away.

I lived just down the block, but my feet wouldn't carry me anymore, so I sat down in the middle of the street.  I was feeling very sorry for myself and wanted the cars to hit me - I was slightly unbalanced back then...  And I started singing, some melodramatic love song, sitting in the street outside his house.  Maybe I wanted him to hear me, I don't know.  Cars drove by, in a circle around me while the drivers yelled or laughed.  In the end I got up and walked home - though I can't remember it.  
woke up the next day and found my clothes in the stairway...some of the other tennants had placed them outside my door.

<b>3. If someone came up to you and said they were from the future, what would it take for them to convince you?</b>
If they gave me next weeks numbers in the great national lottery.  :)

<b>4. Why'd you choose to get a pet rat? What other pets have you had?</b>
I had a dog when I was a kid, a Collie bitch named Bella.  I had a rabbit later on, can't remember the name.  I've had goldfish, and Pontoppidan the rat - she enjoyed being in my pocket or on my shoulder when we went out (she hid in my hair), she used to come with me to the pub.  A nice icebreaker, she was.  A friend had to get rid of her rats, so I took her in.  Then three budgies, a small parrot that we found in the garden (long story), and a mouse that one of the cats caught.  It died though.  :/

But cats - always cats, ever since I was tiny.  There were Rina, a pedigree Norwegian Forest who I had to give away because she was afraid of children (she's 14 years old now and lives a life in luxury - she's handfed chicken and shrimps...).  And Weed, a beautiful blue tortie calico who lived indoors and then one day jumped off the balcony.  Never found her again.  :/  And Monty, a black longhair, fabulous mousehunter!, who died of old age.  Black Hell, who tortured the other cats and had to move.  Blues, a beautiful tabby and white girl who got hit by a car.  Itsy-bitsy, who ate something and got sick - I had to put her down.  The autopsy showed poisoning.   Satan, who went with my ex when we split up.

I've had quite a few cats that I picked up from the street and then found homes to.  Grey, who was...er, grey, and Tiger, another pedigree Norwegian.  Rasmus, who I found when he was just a baby - someone had thrown him out of a car.  A tortie I found in a barn - she was so shy I never got her quite tame, in the end I had her put down because she was being bullied by the other cats and I couldn't find anyone who'd take her in, poor girl.  No one wants a kitty that makes a mess in the corners.  :/  A tabby tortie who followed my brother home from school...cost me a lot of money to get rid of all the vermin...  :p

A lot of animals, spread out over twenty-five years.  Now I only have four cats, Tommy (6), Old Mum (9), Spike (1) and O (5), his mum.  And when O gets spayed later this summer, that'll be the end of it.  For a while, at least.  I love animals, always have and always will, but I think living so close to nature and animals has made me rather unsentimental about the facts of life.  When you get a pet and won't breed it, castrate/spay the animal.  When the cat/dog/rabbit gets old or sick, let the poor thing sleep.  I don't understand those who spend 20.000 dollars to keep a dying animal alive for another six months.  May sound harsh to some people, but to me it's just common sense.

<b>5. What's your fondest childhood memory?</b>
I can't remember.  I remember fragments, images floating by, but not something specific.

You know the deal - if you want to be interviewed, make a comment!

<lj-cut>
<b>1. If you could visit any planet in the Solar System (apart from the Earth), which would you visit?</b>
Tricky!  Io perhaps, to look at vulcans (though I could do that in Iceland as well...).  I'd visit Europa, I think, walk on the ice when an ocean might be lurking beneath.  Perhaps there are living creatures down there, far beneath the ice?  :)
(Charming little typo there - to look at vulcans, instead of volcanoes.  I'll let it stand, 'cos I wouldn't mind studying Vulcans either.)

<b>2. Which do you identify with most, Lord Byron or a sparrow?</b>
A sparrow can fly, Lord Byron couldn't.  I can't fly, therefore I must be a Byron.

<b>3. Do you prefer reading novels in the original or translated into your mother tongue?</b>
Well, when it comes to Scandinavian literature the answer is easy.  I have no problem reading Danish and Swedish, since our languages are so similar.  When it comes to other languages besides English I have no choice, but when it comes to English lit...  It depends on the writer.  If the author uses many high-brow words and idioms, I've always preferred to read the translated versions, simply because there are many things I don't understand.  Wordplay, certain references, the fine distinctions in the choice of words - all that is spoilt on me.  :/  But after I started writing fics I've become a bit braver - at least now I <i>try</i>. 

<b>4. Which Harry Potter character do you think gets the most unfair treatment from the fandom?</b>
Hmm.  The not-so-pretty characters, perhaps?  Those who aren't immediately shaggable by any Trio-member or other ""desirable"" characters; Millicent, Filch, any Hufflepuff, to a certain extent Moody and Dung Fletcher.  People write page up and page down about the woes of Miss Sue Parkinson, but no one ever writes about Millicent.  What these characters have in common is that they wouldn't win the local beauty contest, and this is a young fandom.  Most young people are shallow, it's as easy as that.

The <i>most</i> unfair would IMO be Filch.  There's a reason why he has become who he is.  He's a Squib, born outside of the society he lives in, denied the fellowship that should be his by right of birth.  There are some great stories in his life, I'm sure of it.

<b>5. What was the last thing that made you cry with laughter?</b>
Hmm.  I can't remember.  :/  I haven't cried from laughing in many, many years.  I'm the quietly snickering, raised-eyebrows sort of person.

It's a wizarding drug, of course, so no needles and stuff, but still - can I show someone getting a fix and get away with it on a PG-13 rating?  <i>Repeatedly</i>?  
What about theft?

Planted those pumpkin seeds, by the way, and they're growing like whoa.  It's almost eerie to see how fast it goes - and it's eight plants.  How the hell will I find room for them all?  
J loves them, and I can see why.  Must be more fun for kids when they can actually <i>see</i> the plant growt two centimetres from the evening to the following moring.

Norway deserves it, IMO - her being a hundred years now.

<lj-cut text=""Movie whore meme"">
1. Take the list and post it into your own LJ (as opposed to someone else's LJ, duh), marking movies you've seen with an X, and removing Xes if you haven't seen an already marked one.

2. Add five more movies to the end of the list. The meme must be fed!

3. Count how many X'es you have. If you've seen more than 70 movies, you are a ~*~ Movie Whore ~*~. Post the score of how many movies you've seen in the subject line.

4. Use a LJ-cut since you've got at least one LJ-friend who doesn't really want to see an ungodly number of movies snaking its way down the computer monitor. (Right now the list is over 200 movies)

5. (optional) Question your friend's taste in movies.

"event","The air force wants my brother.  He's supposed to be sent to Stavanger, which is on the other side of the country (joining the military is compulsory for healthy young Norwegian men).  I suggested he could cut off a couple of fingers or something.
My brother's comment?  ""Fuck them.""

It looks like he's been accepted as a trainee in a factory nearby - no definite message yet, though.  That would be luck, because the air force can't force him to break off his education.
""Well, I guess the air force could help you finish that education,"" I muttered, carefully observing his expression.
""I'd rather go to jail,"" he sneered back.  

My little brother, imprisoned for his beliefs.  *shakes head*  Well, let's just hope he gets to be a trainee instead."

<lj-cut>
1. Total number of films owned, dvd or video: 
Around fifty?  I've never counted them, and the videos are stacked away in a closet since the VHS player broke - which means that I have several of my favourites on VHS and can't watch them.  :/

2. Last film I bought: 
The Godfather, on DVD.

3. Last film I watched (in an actual theatre): 
That animated film with all the robots...I think it's called 'Robots'.  Can never seem to remember the title. (/jk)

4. Five films I watch a lot, or that mean a lot to me: 
I'm going to sound like a copycat, but the original <i>Star Wars</i> series, since I grew up with them - it's become a part of my personal history.  <i>Fight Club</i>, because it's a facinating concept and has some brilliant actors.  <i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i>, because it's a beautiful love story and, again, because of the great actors. 
And since this makes five I'll stop there.  Because this is a too difficult list to make.  It all depends, on mood, on how long it's been since last time, on... Yeah, you get the picture.  Maybe if I had a list of thirty I could give them all the place they deserve.

I'm having a little writer's block and can't seem to come up with anything, I've read all my books, I don't have any computer games.  Got the idea for an essay, but I haven't written any essays in ages... *tears at hair*
Can't someone blow up the toolshed or something?  Save me from my boring life!

There may be some spamming from me tonight.  I appologise in advance.

EDITED to include a rec-
<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/pornish_pixies/282051.html"">Down Among the Dead Men</a>, by <lj user=""atdelphi"">.
I rarely visit the Pornish Pixies, so I didn't see this one before now.  Take a look - it's a brilliant piece (<i>of course</i> it is, it's Delphi's work...).  Filch, NC-17, and a stunning portray of this fascinating character."

"event","I'm supposed to go to a consert tonight, and of course I've come down with a cold.  Am currently sneezing my head off, and my throat feels as though I've eaten an anthill.  I'm going anyway, the music will be so loud that no one will notice.  

I haven't been out in so long that I hardly remember where the place *is*.  Nah, that was a lie.  A medium-sized pub of the sort that only let in adults (and I'm old enough now to appreciate this), with a great billiard table (hope it's still there).
I wasn't sure I wanted to go, really...but I've changed my mind.  I've found that if you don't expect too much - that's when you really end up having fun.  Besides, cheep beer is always a plus."

"event","Was over at my Mum's house a few hours ago.  We sat in the living room while she nitted, or that other lady-thing Idontrememberwhatitscalled, and the TV was on as usual - BBC Food.  And there was a lady there who had a whole show where she taught how to boil an egg in the correct way.  
I mean, honestly. 

She also taught us how to open it correctly <i>after</i> it was boiled, and apparently I've been doing it wrong all my life.  I normally just take the hardboiled egg and knock it against something hard and then pick off the shell, but no!  That's not good enough.  I'm supposed to hold it under running water and then peel from the round edge and forward.  (From the way she was fondling that poor egg one got the impression she was thinking 'bout her man's nuts.)
She also taught us the proper way to make scrambled eggs.  ""If you're extra hungry you might even take <i>three</i>,"" she said and looked into the camera with her dead-fish eyes.

I took six eggs once.  I am an anarchist, I am the antichrist..."

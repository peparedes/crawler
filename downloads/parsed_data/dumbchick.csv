"event","<p>Just a few observations<p>&nbsp;</p>1. Just because she didn't want you, doesn't mean all girls are into douchebags. Just because he turned you down, doesn't mean all guys are into skanks. Your personal romantic problems are not a sign of a tragic society wide flaw. And if you are consistently ""unlucky in love""? It's probably you. <p>&nbsp;</p>2. Your job does not define you. Working a high paying job doesn't mean you're better than the guy who sells you cigarettes. And working a shitty job or being poor doesn't give you carte blanche to hate&nbsp; everyone wealthier than you. Oh, and if you've been fired from or quit every job you've had? Hint: it's probably you. <p>&nbsp;</p>3. You have no right to judge someone/look down on them just because they're living a life you wouldn't want, or choosing a path you think is beneath you. Not everyone is ambitious. Not everyone wants kids. Not everyone has the same definition of success or happiness. And that's a good thing. Our differences give us the opportunity to learn from each other, everyday. And if you think everyone else in the world is a failure with nothing to teach you? Yep, once again, probably you.<p>&nbsp;</p>Bonus! Being cynical does not make you more clever, or more worldly than anyone else. It just makes you cynical. Plenty of people have seen more, experienced more, been hurt more, and chosen to drop the adolescent version of cool in favour of openness and un-ironic enthusiasm. This does not make them weak or naive. It makes them awesome. </p><div class=""promo-link""><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/android/link"">LiveJournal app for Android</a>.</i></span></p></div>"

"event","Ok. Not porn. But pictures! Of ideas! Idea Porn! Woo?



So, because all the money I'd put into the wedding savings account had to be re-appropriated for Jeep repairs, I decided to cheer myself up by looking for pretty things and ideas to use when we finally do have money to get stuff. And now, I share with you. With commentary. :)


<img src=""http://www.homewetbar.com/images/prod/wine-candle-chandelier1.jpg"" />

I love this. Nick and I must have a million old bottles laying around, waiting to be turned into something pretty. And, come on! Wine bottle candelabras at a vineyard? What could be more perfect?


Pretty signs...
<img src=""http://d30opm7hsgivgh.cloudfront.net/upload/30172633_CYKklbVI_c.jpg"" />

<img src=""http://d30opm7hsgivgh.cloudfront.net/upload/142580017_AoK3eAPm_c.jpg"" />


Moroccan Lanterns! I <i>think</i> the rainbow one is my favourite, but I like them all. 

<img src=""http://www.bargainbunch.com/i/NEW%20LANTERNS/14119.jpg"" />

<img src=""http://www.bargainbunch.com/i/NEW%20LANTERNS/13365.jpg"" />

<img src=""http://www.bargainbunch.com/i/NEW%20LANTERNS/13175_1.jpg"" />


I feel like Nick would look pretty rockin' in one of these suits...Or something similar

<img src=""http://d30opm7hsgivgh.cloudfront.net/upload/182057269_oB82HQB1_c.jpg"" />

<img src=""http://images.forbes.com/media/2008/06/13/guestattire_01.jpg"" />

<img src=""http://ruffledblog.com/Images/posts/Shopping/vintage-3-piece-suit-1.jpg"" />

<img src=""http://dkl3fnj1o5loa.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/brioni-three-piece-suit.png"" />

I admit, that last suit (a $15,000! Brioni) is pure fantasy. But still. Mmm.

And finally, a few random pretty lighting ideas. 

<img src=""http://d30opm7hsgivgh.cloudfront.net/upload/217884092_UzJkNEqO_c.jpg"" />

I will actually be doing a modified version of this halo... I'm going to combine it with the bead chandelier I've already made.

<img src=""http://d30opm7hsgivgh.cloudfront.net/upload/367668109_wUkQlKoE_c.jpg"" />

Again, pure fantasy. I could probably recreate it, but totally time/cost prohibitive

<img src=""http://d30opm7hsgivgh.cloudfront.net/upload/298194921_73NZMfGi_c.jpg"" />

This one, however, we could definitely do, and it would drastically cut down on the need for individual lighting in it's space. I think it would look nice behind the food/bar area. 


Thoughts?"

Let's take stock...</p><p>I have a job I enjoy with good pay and plenty of hours. <br>I have a home, a working vehicle, and enough money to maintain those things.<br>I have a lovely family who support me.<br>I have great friends. Seriously. I'm even rebuilding some friendships that had cracked or lapsed. <br>My animals are all healthy and cared for.<br>I'm losing weight again.<br>Nick. Just... Nick. He's wonderful. It's not perfect, but every day, at least once, I'm struck by how much I love him. Every day. That's amazing. </p><p>And these are just the major things. So, yeah. This post is just a small thanks to the powers that be, and a recognition of all I have to be thankful for.</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

Manager at Spirit Halloween.<br>I am filled with death and sickness.<br>Nick is pretty awesome and I still like him.<br>I've gotten to see Rachel more often, which is stellar.<br>Joanna is moving to Florida! <br>I started learning how to make jewelry. Dig it.<br>In the next couple years, I might be able to start a wedding planning company with Michelle and Erin. </p><p>So, the good far outweighing the bad, at the moment. I'm into that. Still stressed about health and money and life, but, right now, things are pretty darn good. </p><p>It helps that I just got done riding Xander. There's nothing in the world quite like the feeling of sitting atop a horse like him. Just, controlled fire, coiled underneath you, waiting for your signal to unleash itself and thrust forward like a catapult. Only the energy doesn't subside after the initial release. It gets stronger, and faster, and takes you with it until you know how it feels to fly without wings. </p><p>And I get to call all that mine. He trusts me, and allows me to be his partner. Amazing.

"event","<p>One, Erin is a fantastic human being. Just, always being a lovely, intelligent, awesome friend. I missed her. </p><p>Two, I am going out of my mind being unemployed. </p><p>Three, Nick said this the other day:</p><p>""What we have, what we are... It's really timeless. I mean, anytime anyone reads or writes or thinks about these feelings... About great love, and how honest and true it is... Anytime they think of any of that, in a way, they're thinking about us."" </p><p>...how could I <i>not</i> be in love with him? </p><p>After that point, the whole day went to shit, but... Friends being douchebags, fights, even car trouble... It all pales in comparison with knowing that at least one part of my life, I'm doing right. </p><p>I need more friends like Erin, though. Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure she's one in several billion. :-)</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/iphone/link"">LiveJournal app for iPhone</a>.</i></span></p>"

So that is still making me smile this afternoon. 

Only a few weeks left in Florida. Wondering if I'm doing the right thing."

"event","I guess it's as appropriate as anything else. I'm sorry for not being able to give you what you wanted of me. 

Many men have loved the bells
you fastened to the rein,
and everyone who wanted you
they found what they will always want again.
Your beauty lost to you yourself
just as it was lost to them.

Oh take this longing from my tongue,
whatever useless things these hands have done.
Let me see your beauty broken down
like you would do for one you love.

Your body like a searchlight
my poverty revealed,
I would like to try your charity
until you cry, ""Now you must try my greed.""
And everything depends upon
how near you sleep to me

Just take this longing from my tongue
all the lonely things my hands have done.
Let me see your beauty broken down
like you would do for one your love.

Hungry as an archway
through which the troops have passed,
I stand in ruins behind you,
with your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps.
I love to see you naked over there
especially from the back.

Oh take this longing from my tongue,
all the useless things my hands have done,
untie for me your hired blue gown,
like you would do for one that you love.

You're faithful to the better man,
I'm afraid that he left.
So let me judge your love affair
in this very room where I have sentenced
mine to death.
I'll even wear these old laurel leaves
that he's shaken from his head.

Just take this longing from my tongue,
all the useless things my hands have done,
let me see your beauty broken down,
like you would do for one you love.
Like you would do for one you love."

It wasn't all unpleasant. Seeing Mike and Jacob was actually nice. And it's been ages since I've danced. Certain songs always bring me right back to when I lived with Rachel. Good memories.


But all of this unplanned jaunting down memory lane leaves me vaguely unsettled."

That I speak no more
And my voice be still
As it was before
I will speak no more
I shall abide until
I am spoken for
If it be your will

If it be your will
That a voice be true
From this broken hill
I will sing to you
From this broken hill
All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will
To let me sing

From this broken hill
All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will
To let me sing

If it be your will
If there is a choice
Let the rivers fill
Let the hills rejoice
Let your mercy spill
On all these burning hearts in hell
If it be your will
To make us well

And draw us near
And bind us tight
All your children here
In their rags of light
In our rags of light
All dressed to kill
And end this night
If it be your will

If it be your will.


From this broken hill
All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will
To let me sing"

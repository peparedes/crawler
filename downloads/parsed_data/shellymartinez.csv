"event","I'm way behind on updating this.  I spend more time observing rather than doing actual talking.  I lurk on people's post and laugh at the hypocrisy some of y'all partake in.  It's sad really but since it's not my place to say anything, I avoid calling any of the people out because they would probably whine and cry that big bad Shelly made a point.  ANYWAYS!  I love ranting.  Let's rant about...work next!  Tonight on Impact I have my first match since October.  What kind of crap is that?  ODB and Angelina Love can be booked every freakin' week but someone like me or Christy are stuck valeting all the time.  She's not even on tv anymore last I saw.  I dig being a valet, it's fun, but I don't want to do that all the time and I sure as shit don't want to be the token jobber that puts Kong over.  Everyone else does that.  We all get it, she's big.  Maybe it's time for something new?  How about, oh I don't know, more knockouts tag matches?  Or even more matches one on one where Kong isn't involved.  She doesn't have to be the constant focus just because she's the champ.  Look how much Beth wrestles on RAW and she's the champ there.  When was the last time she defended her belt?  Women's wrestling shouldn't be focused solely on a title.  We don't need a pretty little belt to show us we're talented.  It's never been about that and it shouldn't be.  I mean look at Jeff.  He'll probably never get the big title because some bitch doesn't think he is over enough with the fans to get it and yet he's one of the top guys WWE has.  No one needs to see a belt on him to know he's better than alot of the roster.  10+ years in the business is proof enough of that.

Too many people focus on the materialism of the business.  Yes I would love to see Jeff win the big belt but if he never does?  It won't ever change how great of a wrestler he is.  You don't need a big belt to be talented and even if you win it, you could just be kissing the proper ass to get it.  Belt does not equal talent.  Can we all do that formula?  I hope so.  

Work. Work. Work.  I do other work besides wrestling.  I recently did a spot on RVD's internet show which was fucking awesome!  I love that man.  I also filmed some other thing a couple days ago.  It's 4am, don't expect me to remember what exactly it was.  Aside from all that I just spend my time at home really.  Sometimes I follow Jeff around but WWE isn't my favorite place to be so I'll generally crash in the hotel till he gets back from the show.

The Hall Of Fame is coming up and of course I am attending.  I know a few other TNA'ers are coming so it'll be interesting to say the least.  Everyone going bought their own tickets, most just to see Flair in ducted, but I would go regardless because of Jeff.  I probably won't be seated next to him since Matt always seems to be his date but I'll just stash myself in the back with whichever TNA group I can find.  I'm pretty sure Kurt, Karen, and Reso are going, though no one really knows.  Booker and Sharmell might show as well.  Anyone who goes from TNA is going to be an old time WWE'er I think so it'll be pretty cool.  I doubt any of us will be shown because we are from the opposing company but it'll be rad to be there regardless.  Everyone is just so pumped about Flair being inducted.  It's going to be so sad when he actually retires.  Something tells me though he won't be gone long and will end up doing commentary or something.  Maybe he can replace Coach.  God that guy should never be given a mic.  Why he was picked to replace JBL is beyond me.  And people wonder why I hate Smackdown, aside from the obvious reasons.

I should go lay down now.  Jeff is off lurking somewhere, probably painting something he shouldn't be, so I need to go make sure my dogs are all their normal colors."

"event","hey guys! so mardi gras was kind of a waste of time. its a long and complicated story, dealing with the vip list, and somebody flaking out and not calling till the last second after driving to sunnyvale to go to the forum, and then trying to get the owner to come out and get us in for free, but him not answering the phone and people being too cheap to pay and bitter about not getting on the vip. so we just drove back and hung out at a friend's house and listened to him play guitar and had some drinks and brownies. bonded with some french kids too. oh and downtown san jose is freakin crazy. one of our friends wanted to go to a club there (it was 21+ so most of us couldnt go) and while dropping her off we saw not just cops on every corner, but like swat teams with their big plastic masks and rifles. also a bloody man walking around. he was literally bleeding from the head and had his shirt tied around it, but there was still blood spilling down. and it took us about half an hour to drive those 3 blocks from santa clara street to the 101 entrance. oh there were also lots of prostitute business cards. quite a night...

so i guess saturdays at work has been designated as livejournal update day.

hey nick, did you get an itrip? and if so, does it work well in ur car? i still dont understand the porn number...."

"event","damnit, i'm so exhausted. ive been having 13 hour school days mondays and wednesdays, and 12 hour workdays tuesdays and thursdays. i kind of work off and on fridays and saturdays, and sundays are my only days off. but all my time off has been homework time lately, i'm not sure if i can make it through the semester like this. also my chemistry class is so hard, since i skipped chem15 and mostly everyone else in the class took chem 15, the teacher assumes we know a lot of stuff that i dont know, so im going to have to find time to go in the tutoring center or something. at least work isn't too bad, sometimes it just seems to be bullshit. like the other day at abercrombie all i did for two hours was open doors and let people into fitting rooms, so dull.... and i do get time to do homework at my other job.... 

oh on a happier note, my parents pitched for a new laptop for my birthday, so i just ordered a new powerbook (and ipod to match) :D yay! i dont know how long shipping's gonna take though,but the ipod will be here by my birthday.

so nick, how was that porn number..."

"event","why is it so freakin cold all of a sudden, yesterday i was driving around in flip flops with my top down and the sun was shining and everything in the world was fine. and now today its all stupid outside and the stupid sliding doors at my work are broken so we're just keeping them open. and its like a perfect windtunnel down the hall to my desk. everywhere else is fine, but my desk sucks. and to top it off clients keep coming in and reminding me that this is a cold spot, as if i didnt notice.... ugh damnit another one just came and did it, right as i was typing this... 

so how's the dq lounge going marcy? where can i get some coups?"

"event","hello turlock people! remember me? sorry for not really making an effort to keep in touch, i've just been pretty busy lately.
i just wanted to say howdy and that i didnt forget any of you.
so... i'm in san jose :D
oh btw i dont know if anyone wants to call me for some reason, but here's my cell # in case you don't have it (408) 603-5851.
ok so update on my life right now: i go to 2 schools and i have 2 jobs, so that takes up most of my time, and on the weekends i'm still pretty much the drunk uncle lol. what 2 schools you ask? san jose city college and evergreen valley college, they're ok, i dont really know many people there, oh and i have a 5 hour chemistry class, 5 hours! its a 2 hour lecture followed directly by a 3 hour lab. what two jobs you ask? i work at easter seals bay area (probably never heard of it) its kinda like a therapeutic center w/ a pool and yoga and kickboxing classes, and i'm a receptionist. i call that my adult job b/c everybody else there is grown up. i also work at abercrombie, my teenie job, which is ok except its lame work (but the people that work there are fun) and they pay about half as much as easter seals. 
ok, so basically my point was to start keeping in touch with people a little bit more than i had, so let's give it a try"

"event","ok so i got a livejournal, i dont think anyone has my name thingy though... 
so david just left my house, he's going back to turlock tonight cuz his flight leaves from modesto in the morning, and even though i know i'll see him tomorrow in san francisco when he switches planes i feel really really sad. i feel like i'll be alone now even though i'm now living with more people(mom, charly, and abi)(dad's in turlock for a while) but after being with david for 10 months day and night... its gonna be really hard... can't wait for august when i go to europe. nick, marcy, and alex are coming though and thats pretty cool and i know they're coming to say bye to david but the fact that they're spending the night with me makes me feel good cuz none of my friends from san jose ever came to turlock.

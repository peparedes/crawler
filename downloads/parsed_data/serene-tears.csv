"event","I've done it, when I said it would not be done again. I opened up and the heartbreak is pouring in. I like someone, but it's a secret. Mainly because I can't,I won't and I am not supposed to. If only it were so simple, that I could just make this feeling go away I would, instead of living in a state of heartbreak. Lucky for me said person does not know, or else maybe I would die. Lucky for me I don't have to see said person for at least a year, maybe never again. Although now I do feel like a stalker, trying to find pictures to last me a year, or two, or maybe a lifetime. What can I say other than, once more, I want to be rid of this feeling for good. Maybe focus on something more than a crushing crush. No good feelings lead to no good. And I, my friend, am up to no good."

"event","I dont belong. It's not just a lingering feeling anymore. Its just there. I know I love my friends, and for the most part, they love me back. But I am not who I want to be, and I'm still not sure I know what that is. I mean, I know what I want to be in a sense, but I dont know if KNOWING what I want to be is the same as being myself... ya know? Of course not...

Tomorrow I am protesting the silence forced upon gays, bis, lesbians and transgendered people from the prejudice shown towards them. I will not speak at all. For those who wish to join me, I support your choice. For those wishing to speak tomorrow, I also support that. Maybe if I stand up for a greater good, my minor problems wont be so problematic.

On the same yet slightly different front, I am sick to death of people telling me ""yeah, im sorry its so shitty, but ya know, there are a ton of other people going through exactly the same thing"" like i am some kind of selfish bitch. You know what? It's not the same damn thing, and you do not know how I feel and what is going through my mind. So Shut the Fuck Up.


I'm done."

She needs to be blissfully happy. I heart Hayat. And I am really happy that Gloria finally called up Ken and asked him to the movies. I think I was more excited than she was.... I really hope they make babies...er, date I mean.Hey, if you guys make babies, do you think he could hook me up with Ian? Lol. Jk, I would never wish myself on Ian, or the guilt of putting me on him for ken.  I love it when my friends are happy. I guess I'm just not on the ""Life is going great"" list yet.

"event","I am so tired right now. Currently I am abusing my five minutes self alotted break from my SSPD (i.e. hell). I have not had nearly enough sleep lately. That sucks. All last week I was running low on sleep and then I stayed up until 1 on Friday, thinking, hey, I still get 9 hours cause I have to be awake to get ready for festival at about 10. Well my mom knocks on my door at like 2:45 am, saying my aunt went into labor. We ran to the hospital where i remained, in an unsleeping state, until 10, where i rushed home to change and rushed out to festival. From festival (where i have since then learned we recieved a 1) my dad and i ran back to the hospital (still no baby) where i grabbed a bite to eat and immediately went to volleyball practice. From there I went to drop off Julie, and take carrie to my house.She and I stayed up until 3 because neither of us could sleep (i was in a really weird state because of my lack of sleep i was a bit punchy, and that caused us to laugh for about an hour non-stop) plus i couldnt leave her awake and just sleep while she was a guest. So then we went to sleep (then TIME CHANGE-LOSE AN HOUR) Then we woke up at what would be 5 FUCKIN AM and went to a volleyball tourney. There we played all day and I got home late and continued to do homework until 12 ish. The past two nights i havent done much other than homework. I am about to die. Well, off to see the new baby/eat/cram for a test all at once. Happy trails to you all"

"event","So today in orchestra I decided randomly (seriously randomly...like in the middle of the 4th line of molly) that I would found the School for the Emo. We could import the Emo from around the world into this one, quite centralized location (of course it has to be wichita Kansas, how much more central do you want?!) They would be forced to carry around notebooks (i know, such a task for the tyical Emo kid!) and they would never get detentions. Their only ""punishments"", if you could call it that, would be to write in their notebooks on how they felt about the daily events. Dress code would be strictly Emo style(if you have any discrepencies please see a local show). Chucks would obviously be the shoe of preference, but on hot days I think we could make an exception for flip-flops. MP3,Cd, and Cassette players would, of course, be allowed. That is because music is one of the ultimate forms of expression. All classes would have Emo names. Oh yes, and I would have first pick on my guy of choice. Now how cool would that be? I'll tell you- very, very cool. 


Oh yes, Gloria MUST date Ken. (I figure if I say it enough times, and she reads it enough times, she will believe it and eventually do so)."

"event","Wait for Sleep-Dream Theater
Standing by the window
Eyes upon the moon
Hoping that the memories
Will leave her spirit soon

She shuts the door and lights
And lays her body onthe bed
Where images and words are running deep
She has to much pride to pull the sheets above her head
So quietly she lays and wait for sleep

She stares at the ceiling
And tries not to think
And pictures the chain
She's been trying to link again
But the feeling is gone

And water can't cover her memory
And ashes can't answer her pain
God give me the power to take breath from a breeze
And call life from a cold metal frame

In with the ashes
Or up with the smoke from the fire
With wings up in heaven
Or here lying in bed
Palm of her hand to my head
Now and forever curled in my heart
And the heart of the world

Say it Ain't So- Weezer
Oh yeah,
all right.
Somebody's Heine'
is crowdin' my icebox
somebody's cold one
is givin' me chills
Guess I'll just close my eyes

oh yeah,
all right,
feels good now,
inside.

Flip on the telly,
Wrestle with Jimmy
Something is a-bubbling
Behind my back
The bottle is ready to blow...

Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a lifetaker

I can't confront you
I never could do
That which might hurt you
just try and be cool.
and I say
This wayis a waterslide away from me
that takes you further every day (day)
So be cool

say it ain't so
your drug is a heartbreaker
say it ain't so,
my love is a lifetaker

Dear Daddy,
I write you in spite of years of silence.
You've cleaned up, found Jesus, things are good or so I hear.
This bottle of Steven's awakens ancient feelings.
Like father, stepfather, the son is drowning in the flood.
yeah, yea yea. yea yea.

say it ain't so.
your drug is a heartbreaker.

"event","Carrie spent the night last night. I had a lot of fun. Carrie and I get along so well. We would stop and talk for hours and not even realize it.We went out to dinner and rented some movies. We only got to watch Sylvia though (which I was thoroughly excited about) because I had a HUGE migraine and we were both exhausted from the tourney.

The tournament was a lot of fun, even if we didnt win any medals...again. Lol. Our team is really good, but it seems that the refs always screw us over...all I have to say is that ball was blatantly in . Ah well. Stephen (whos last name is Zenda, how cool is that?) came to watch Carrie. He's so much fun to hang out with. We played hackie sack, cause Stephen is really into that, and apparently I got better since the last time. I think he's starting to feel comfortable around me, which is cool, cause he's started talking more.

I am NOT looking forward to going back to school tomorrow. Sometimes I think I need new friends, but I dont want to go get new friends. And besides, who else would I hang out with? (and no Gloria, that does not apply to you in any way shape or form). I feel so left out of everything, but I have no idea where my personality would fit in. Not that im trying to ""fit in"" per say, but I would like to feel good about myself while I'm around my friends. I would like to feel included, and like I know what is going on as it happens. I am sick to death of finding out the most important information 6 fucking months after it happens. That's a long time to be oblivious. I hate that. But I still can't leave my friends...grrr, I wish I knew what I wanted. Or at least what was possible and highly plausable as far as controlling my own life. Sometimes I want to just drop IB, have a little fun, be a little more ""care free"" I guess. Don't get me wrong, I love it...but I just dont know anymore. This is my 4th year in it, and its getting rather ""old hat"" if you know what I mean. Of course I could never drop IB, and in the one-in-a-million chance that I did, I would definately take AP/honors classes....I just need to find myself, and people arent making it any easier than it is. That said, I'll stop bitching and whining. Later days."

On a lighter note, Ken likes Gloria. I can feel it. I was happy to hear he remembered who I was, but thats beside the point. They should date, and have little carrot-top babies. They would be so cute. 

Glow and I went to B&N tonight on one of our ""loser-dates"". It was fun, I bought a book, had some coffee. We talked. All was good. We just want our emo boys. Nothing more.

"event","My window is open, like my imagination
Candles cast flickering shadows on my wall 
I stand, and move from my desk to my window.
The cool breeze brushes against my face,
so bruised and washed out that not even I know who I am anymore.
Yet the night air knows me, and not of the hate that I have felt, so it touches me without cringing.
I look to the moon and it shatters into a million tiny shards that rain down on me.
The shards kiss the bed of white roses that has replaced the worldly presence from which I have fallen. 
My white roses bleed from the kisses, like I bled from the tears.
I cry out for them, but my nostalgia knows not how to plea. I have never longed for a pure past, only shut my eyes and washed the trail of pain away.
Then I see you, laying in the roses, covered in their blood.
Yet, you lay smiling. Slowly you sit, and then stand.
Slowly you make your way toward me, my prison.
When I reach for your hand, you actually reach back for mine.
As our fingers touch, my dreams fade and our reality turns to ash.
I laugh and quickly turn away.
In what reality would you have reached for me?"

"event","Still new at this posting thing. Well Gloria and I plan to do something on Friday. That should be fun. I don't know if she picked the coffe-bookstore option or the movie option yet. Gloria, lemme know where our ""loser-date"" is going be. 

I feel kinda bad because I haven't gotten ahold of Carrie yet, we were supposed to do something this week, but I forgot to call her on Wed., and she left practice on Tuesday before I could talk to her about it, and I can't do anything today, and I'm hanging out with Gloria tomorrow. Maybe Carrie can come over tomorrow night and spend the night here. Then we can just go out to the tourney together...erg. Or not. She's probably taking Stephen again, so that means she'll want to pick him up.... Ah well, whatever. 

So, tourney on Saturday. I'm excited. We only had one practice this week and then I went to watch my sister's tournament. That made me want to play so much. I hope this time not everyone will be in a shitty mood. Last time all Amy could talk about was her huge hickey (that was blatantly obvious) and the fact that she was ""so dead"" if her mom saw it. It wouldn't have been that bad if it was her boyfriend who gave it to her (still kinda gross cause he's like 4 years older than her), but he was still out of town. Carrie was in an awful mood last time, all she could do was complain and whine about everything. But playing hackey-sack with her and Stephen was fun, even though Stephen was the only one who could actually do 3-peg. So Carrie and I got hit a lot.lol.

Enough of this volleyball talk though. I think I'm going to talk my mom into taking me to the pawn shop when she gets home (after I shower though...) so I can go look at amps. I don't really want to blow my little wad of cash I like to call savings, but I want to get a fairly decent amp. Then maybe I can practice and not suck so bad at EVERYTHING I DO. Downside is, the amp that I blew, or rather, that Paige blew for me, was my Aunt's. Although she said she would rather me buy myself an amp and keep it- my mom said I should but the amp and give it back when im done with it... I figure while I'm at the pawn shop I may as well look at some of the guitars. They can have some really good deals. 

Well, enough of my boring talk. This is why I stopped updating my last diary. I feel as though I am this incesant, annoying buzz, with nothing good to talk about. Oh well, I guess if you came here on your own, it was your fate in your hands..."

But I'll take what I can get, right? Is it so crazy to look forward to talking to him everyday? I like smiling, and talking to him gives me genuine smiles. When he told me what he did, cutting, my heart stopped. Not only because he hurt himself, but because I couldn't stop it no matter what, cause I'm not there. He promised me he would stop, and I sincerely hope he does, but thats just it. That is all I can do, hope. Well I can't really think of anything to say...At least nothing to say that isn't redundant or over the top. So I guess I'm off to listen to 'Wait for Sleep'. I'll be in touch."

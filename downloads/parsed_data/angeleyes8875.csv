"event","Is destiny true? and if it is...are some people ment to be unhappy? can u mess it up? can you ever be completely content with life? Is anyone ever completely happy? Is there love that never loses the freshness of romance? How long does it really take to fall in love? can it really take minutes? hours? days? weeks? 
when you finally get what u have always wanted out of life will you be happy?"

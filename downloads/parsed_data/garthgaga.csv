Album: Delicious Surprise  
Title: My Give A Damn's Busted  
 

Well you filled up my head with so many lies
You've twisted my heart 'til something snapped inside
I'd like to give it one more try
But, my give a damn's busted

You can crawl back home, say you were wrong
Stand out in the yard and cry all night long
Go ahead and water the lawn
My give a damn's busted

chorus:
I really wanna care
I wanna feel something
Let me dig a little deeper
No, sorry, nothing

You can say you've got issues
You can say you're a victim
It's all your parents' fault, I mean after all you didn't pick em
Maybe somebody else has got time to listen
My give a damn's busted

Well your therapist says it was all a mistake
A product of the Prozac and your codependent ways
So who's your enabler these days
My give a damn's busted

Chorus:
I really wanna care
I wanna feel something
Let me dig a little deeper
No, still nothing

It's a desperate situation
No tellin what you'll do
If I don't forgive you, you say your life is through
Come on give me something I can use
My give a damn's busted

Chorus:
Well, I really wanna care
I wanna feel something
Let me dig a little deeper
No, man, sorry
Just nothing, no

You've really done it this time
My give a damn's busted


PS to Joel...I have been trying to talk to you...I'm getting married this coming march...I'd like to send you an invite but where to? Email me."

"event","Well if anyone is still reading this I have moved and I am in the process of getting settled. I had trouble getting my computer going because the blasted thing would not recognize my modem, I think I had a bad memory stick or something somewhere. Anywho, I ended up getting a brand new computer and things are back to semi normal. Everything is status quo, Danny and I have been together for 6 months plus and still going strong. I think this is a new world record for me. I am still at Jones and it still sux eggs but at least it is a paycheck. It's better than nothing. Anyway just a short note to say hi and that I am still here if anyone in cyberland cares. If not I understand. Whatever."

"event","I saw Narnia with Dr. Madd (the love of my life) and two of the other people I work with. By the way, no you are the greatest :) anyway Narnia was AWESOME I have been waiting for months (since I saw Star Wars III with freaky Frankie) and lemme say that it was definitely worth the wait! That movie ROCKED! Tilda Swinton made a wonderfully creepy White Witch and I loved Georgie Henley's portrayal of Lucy. They both were wonderfully cast. And they did a wonderful job making it seem realistic. How the Hollywood techies made the animals talk and the other creatures I will never know. But it was exciting! Needless to say I had a wonderful time even with a small headache. Well all is status quo for now just checking in. Later"

I am at the point that there is only two reasons I haven't quit yet other than the fact that I am not a quitter unless I have a good reason to like I find something better.  Ugh. Anyway I don't have much to say cept *sings* ""HAPPY 27TH BIRTHDAY TO ME"" Yup 27 wow and I am only slightly better off than I was this time last year the only difference is that I am actually in a functional relationship with a nonf*ckwit! I knew there had to be one out there somewhere I just didn't think he'd be this gaga about me then again what's not to love? I am still in a job that a high school drop out could do though. Well that's all I can think of for now."

2 fights and I'm surprised he still loves me
I'm surprised that he wants to marry me
but there are still issues that need to be addressed
I'm sure things will work out, but there are ""things"" that aren't going right.
for one thing:

AJ:
ohhh...

Brian:
Don't pretend you're sorry
you know you're not
You know you got the power to make me weak inside
And girl you leave me breathless
But it's ok
Cause you are my survival
Now hear me say...

Howie:
I can't imagine life without your love
And even forever don't seem like long enough

Chorus:
'Cause everytime I breathe I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
Everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

AJ:
Maybe I'm a drifter
maybe not
Cause I have known the safety of floating freely in your arms
I don't need another lifeline
It's not for me
Cause only you can save me
Oh, can't you see

Nick:
I can't imagine life without your love
And even forever don't seem like long enough
(Brian: Don't seem like long enough, yeah)

Chorus:
Cause everytime I breathe I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
And everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

Kevin:
Go on and pull me under
Cover me with dreams, yeah
Love me mouth to mouth now
You know I can't resist
Cause you're the air that I breathe

Chorus:
Everytime I breathe I take you in (Brian: everytime I breathe, yeah)
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it (AJ: baby I can't help it)
Keep me drowning in your love
And everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it (Brian: Baby I can't help it)
Keep me drowning in your love (Brian: Loooooooooooooooooove)

Got me drowning

AJ: Keep me drowning in your love

by Sherrie Austin 

He was a hot-blooded rebel, he was aiming to please
He had more than a tattoo up his sleeve
Marylou, Peggy Sue, Suzy Q, Norma Jean

He was pretty as a picture on his motorbike
He never met a mirror that he didn't like
Sorry dude, with your rude attitude, take a hike

Goodness, gracious, mercy me
Somebody tell me when will I be

Lucky, lucky in love
Roll myself a seven when I throw the dice
I've been waiting for the king of hearts
Still I get the joker every time
When will I be, lucky in love

I met a sweet-talking guy from Paris, Tennessee
He bought me french fries at the Dairy Queen
He came on strong, before too long
He was on bended knee

Now when I hear his footsteps up my block
I hear the tick of his biological clock
Sorry hon', gotta run, it's been fun, still in shock

Goodness gracious, mercy me
Somebody tell me when will I be

Lucky, lucky in love
Roll myself a seven when I throw the dice
I've been waiting for the king of hearts
Still I get the joker every time
When will I be, lucky in love

Goodness gracious, mercy me
Somebody tell me when will I be

Lucky, lucky in love
Roll myself a seven when I throw the dice
I've been waiting for the king of hearts
Still I get the joker every time
When will I be
Oh when will I be
Oh yeah, when will I be

25 OMG a quarter of a century old in 3 days (the 19th) and I have done some evaluating.

In a quarter of a century I 
1. Have Graduated HS and College with honors 

but 

2. Have a HS dropout job and still live with my mommy....but at least I am gainfully employed...

Does this define me as a failure?

And on the love front...I'm still single and have NO prospects for anything but for the rest of my life...

Predictions for the next quarter of a century?
To be the old woman on the hill that is an old maid and has 50 cats...one for every year of her life...Number one will be a black short hair male named Salem.

On the plus side I lost 38 pounds in 3 years...GO ME!!!

Oh yeah I'm depressed."

by Garth Brooks</div> 

<div style=""text-align: center;"">She sits among the pieces of broken glass and photographs
Reluctantly releases the last of what was her past
It struck without a warning or did she just ignore the signs
In those dark clouds forming behind her silver lines

Chorus:
THE DOOR IT SLAMS LIKE THUNDER AND THE TEARS THEY FALL LIKE RAIN
AND THE WARNINGS FROM HER FAMILY WHIRL LIKE A HURRICANE
SHE'S DROWNING IN EMOTIONS AND SHE CANNOT REACH THE SHORE
SHE'S ALIVE BUT CAN SHE SURVIVE THE STORM

A broken jewel box dancer lies in peices down the hall
She's finding out the answers don't change nothing at all
It's time that she stopped searching for who's to blame or what went wrong
The only thing for certain is he's gone, she's got to move on

Repeat Chorus:

Someday days just roll on by without a gray cloud in the sky
She keeps telling herself, ""I will make it on my own.""
And her friends they've all gone back to their lives
Thinking she will be alright
As she races through the night to make it home

Repeat chorus:

She sits among the pieces of broken glass and photographs
Reluctantly releases the last of what was her past</div>"

How You Ever Gonna Know 
by Garth Brooks 

Album : Sevens 

that old wind that's whiping out there 
it's whistling your tune
that wind blew pyramids to egypt
and footprints to the moon
that old star that you've been wishin on 
is shinning mighty bright
it's the fire inside your heart
that's gonna lead you to the light

how you ever gonna know
what it's like to live there
how you ever gonna know
the victory
how you ever gonna know
what it's like when dreams become reality
how you ever gonna know
how it feels to hold her
how you ever gonna know
what it's like to dance
how you ever gonna know
if you never take the chance

you know failure isn't failure 
if a lesson from it's learned
i guess love would not be love
without a risk of being burned
anything in life worth having
Lord it has its sacrifice
but the gift that you're receiving 
is worth more than the price

how you ever gonna know
what it's like to live there
how you ever gonna know
what you never knew
how you ever gonna know
if you're down here doin 
what the good Lord put you here to do
how you ever gonna know
if you could have done it
how you ever gonna know
how it feels to fly
how you ever gonna know
if you never dare to try

listen not to the critics 
who put their own dreams on the shelf
if you wanna get the truth to admit it
you gotta find out for yourself

how you ever gonna know
what its like to be there
how you ever gonna know
if you're the best
how you ever gonna know
what you believe in
if you don't put it to the test
how you ever gonna know
how it feels to hold him
how you ever gonna know
what livin is
how you ever gonna know
if you never chase the dream

how you ever gonna know
your potential
how you ever gonna know
victory
how you ever gonna know
what it's like when dreams become reality
how you ever gonna know
how it feels to hold him
how you ever gonna know
what it's like to dance
how you ever gonna know
if you never take the chance

<lj-cut text=""Body Meeting"">
 BODY MEETING

     All the organs of the body were having a meeting, trying to decide who 
was the one in charge.


     ""I should be in charge,"" said the brain, ""because I run all the body's 
systems, so without me nothing would happen"".

     ""I should be in charge,"" said the blood, ""because I circulate oxygen 
all over so without me you'd all waste away.""


     ""I should be in charge,"" said the stomach,"" because I process food and 
give all of you energy.""


     ""I should be in charge,"" said the legs, ""because I carry the body 
wherever it needs to go.""


     ""I should be in charge,"" said the eyes, ""because I allow the body to 
see where it goes.""


     ""I should be in charge,"" said the rectum, ""Because I'm responsible for 
waste removal.""

     All the other body parts laughed at the rectum and insulted him, so in 
a huff, he shut down tight.


     Within a few days, the brain had a terrible headache, the stomach was 
bloated, the legs got wobbly, the eyes got watery, and the blood was toxic. 
They all decided that the rectum should be the boss.


     The Moral of the story?


     The asshole is usually in charge.

"event","sooooooooooo. i haven't updated for aaaaaaaages. i did exams. was very very nervous when i did them but they were ok. still have an internet exam on the 15th that i've only started studying just the tiniest bit for. And oh yeah, I'm HOOOOOOOOOOME! lol yes i'm typing this at my supercool home computer that is miles better than my laptop. gave yuri a batho. he says hello a lot cos he's so excited that i'm home. so odd to see dubai again with its changes and new buildings. everyone did the equivalent of falling off their perches when they saw me cos i am a new stick. i think i was a tree trunk before.

God it;s so weird to be here. Yuri couldn't stop chatting to me for like an hour when i first arrived. i got held up at the airport cos they had a local trainee  at Passport Control and they also got ruffled at my DVD collection at the last baggage check. BUT THEY DIDN'T LOOK inside!! I was soooo relieved. Hehe And I just remembered on the first flight, there was this loud Canadian older guy who helped me put my trolley bag up and then said to the guy who was sitting next to me ""How come you get to sit next her! And I have to sit next to this dumb guy"" (pointing to his neighbour who was grinning). I was like *duck head and blush as much as a indian can lol* 

i'm so happy to be here but it's weird cos sometimes i'm thinking how hard it will be to leave. and i was utterly devastated when my mum said she had to join uncle nick in going to goa from the 14th to the 23rd. THE TWENTY THIRD. I just lost it. that's too long. like the 20th/21st fine. not the 23rd. I don't want to go back to Canada ever. everyone's desperate here. no bread. so why pay all this for me to go to school if we can't afford it? god i'm so confused here. everything's in a muddle. they're trying to act like this all is normal but it isn't. i'm here. mama won't be. then i have to go back to hell. the point? fuck it hurts. i guess i thought everything would be fine once i got here and it isn't. 

in other news i convinced mama and daddy to let me have half a glass of the super expensive wine i bought from the airport. you may not realise what an achievment that is. i'm 19 and its like hitting my head on a brick wall trying to get them to let me to drink. i still haven't had my pizza or my chinese. i just want my mum here with me. i came all this way, altering exam times, and missing school in january to be here for longer. fuck this just fuck this.

that is a mini slice of what's been going on here at home and in my head."

"event","So. I got through yesterday. Which was quite a feat. Some parts of it were good and some parts of it were very very bad and humiliating. The big thing happened after the exam. 

Kurt's little comment hurt a fair bit. But it was only icing on the cake compared to what happened before. I swear I would have reacted more if my heart hadn't been fair dead already. See he's blind. And a lot of people at this uni know him cos he's been in their classes. I always thought he was a great bloke. Always talking to everybody. Yesterday at the theatre there was a line up at the ladies room in the intermission. Kurt came with the class as well, and someone had said something about him taking advantage and feeling them up while they gave him help. I thought 'nah' he's always been really nice to me. But there I was in the line-up. Other ppl from uni had already gone to the loo, cos there were only old ladies and other 'dignified' theatre-goers there. So when he asked where was the men's loo I had to help cos there was no one who knew him in that line. As I was nudging him in the right direction he says in a loud voice ""I remember you from our NATS class. Yes, you're the girl who couldn't afford to go to school in England."" I was stunned. And those women in the line up looked at him and me. I just couldn't react. It's one thing to be blind, but that doesn't mean you're without some sense of decency. Anyway. all I said was ""Yes Kurt. That's me. You know what - the bathroom's through there, straight ahead of you.""  

High point: Professor Gobert shepherding us (around thirty uni students) to that poky little pub and the hard-to-find theatre through the subways. No one here dares to hold up the subway doors and he dared to do it to make sure all of us got out of the train. I met a lot of ppl. It's funny when you put us in that situation of sitting around a table with food and drink instead of being at class. Changes everything. And he was doing the Toronto Walk. All I can say is we all got our term's exercise keeping up with him, running across streets almost colliding with street cars. If I hadn't lost everything before coming I'd have had a lot more fun.  He's a good man. And I was with good people yesterday. They made me forget everything until I came home at around 11.40 pm. A group of 15 of us stuck together until we made it all the way back to York."

"event","<P>so i finished another big piece yesterday. Just an independent drawing which was supposed to be in-class on the last day, but cos i'm handing everything in early i did it now. same size as the 3 panels. er chalk, charcoal and conte. came out ok i guess. i liked it at the end anyway. key requirement was that it was abstract which i can say i pretty much fulfilled. everything else was our choice. </P>
<P>snowed like mad yesterday. i think that's why i couldn't get through to Goa, poor uncle Nic getting those phantom phone calls that were actually me. ****ing York long-distance cards, that's what it was. I need to buy the proper cards, specially if Ma is going to stay there longer. Steffu girl is coming with Esper today to see them i think. So she'll be happy to see Mama, both of them actually. I know the strain of keeping it all in is getting to Esper so it's good Ma's there. And hehe Ma'll get some food i guess. </P>
<P>OMG EARTHQUAKE IN IRAN, TREMORS IN DUBAI! shite when i saw the yahoo news title i said that's TOO CLOSE, then i check <lj user=""istara"" />&nbsp; and lo, there were tremors on Sheikh Zayed road. Heh there's me panicking cos Baba's in E.C past the 2nd interchange on Sheikh Zayed and both Tanta Priss and Tanta Hyce are in the skyscraper buildings at the start of Sheikh Zayed. T. Priss's whole building ran out as did the Emirates Towers and others. But I was worried about Baba cos who will get to him in time should something happen? Daddy's stuck in Karama branch and Mama's in Goa.</P>
<P>In other news. I hate revising and&nbsp;I hate exams. Hehe I'd rather have essays. I hate the build up while revising - you get so nervous. grrr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>"

"event","sooooooo. had con crit today. First, before that I had Film lecture which he cut short AND said there'd be no tutorials cos of the blowing snow that was going to get worse. yay! lol i was happy, heh and i really didn't realise how bad the snow would be. He was really kind that way today.

End up at con crit. I hang mine up. They are the biggest there, but by no means the 'best'. So she starts with mine, and I get comments but just a few compared to everyone's later. Now I know that they were good. Really good, cos I pushed myself, but the comments mislead me I think. I was really really insecure until i actually spoke to her during the break. She's like look i saw what you did. it's good and i saw you pushed yourself. She seemed a bit annoyed - she prolly thought I was fishing. Or that I was stupid or summat. I agree - I am stupid cos I just needed to hear her say that. Am I that insecure? I dunno. I think it's because I have no one here I can get feedback from. Like at home I'd show mama or baba, but here? Heh Rahel was so amazed but she is not 'educated' in art - she's all science. Other ppl said it was amazing and stuff. But I dunno why I felt I needed more? I mean I'm not usually that needy in compliments or accolades, but I felt a bit empty and low today. I think it was because I put my soul in that work. You know I just surrendered it to God - I said I can't do this, help me. And I get a work that is so beautiful, that when I look at it, I'm like heh I DIDN""T do that. But I dunno. It's like with Art sometimes, as with music, something is just so right and it fits, and it's about something that really matters. 

mama and unc and clement got to goa ok. were at the lawyers gearing up and stuff. I heard in mama's voice that she was bearing up, not happy. she couldn't say anything i know. it's like with the aunts and unc, when it concerns le cukoo you can't say anything. so mama has sacrificed everything to be there all the time. to them its like so what? i hate that. cos she deserves more. i miss her more than anything. and baba. i saw him on the web cam - he's getting so big. Like manly big. I mean he was already way taller than me. But sometimes I expect to see the little boy in the camera, not this big guy with a fit broad shouldered body that's so not my side of the family inheritance. he used to be so little. and i kind of hate missing all this. watching him grow. my git. and daddy. he makes me laugh all the time. and his love is like this constant thing where you know he'd do anything for you.  ah and my baby yuyie. he's my little boy, and i'll always miss him. 

you know the hardest thing about these hols is knowing that they're so short. that i have to come back and endure this again. And I know from last year that second term is always worse, especially emotionally. And considering I made myself ill and I was pretty much fucked psychologically for this term, I'm really not looking forward to the next. 

I can't talk to guys. And I see these two fit ones. Like they're not posers like so much of the male population at York. None of that 'yo' shite and body language. One's really beautiful. Like his bone structure and eyes. V. dark. He speaks slow, but when you see his art, he does well with the deep thinking stuff, which is always a plus. The other bloke has manners, and is nice to everyone. Just a regular Canadian guy. For some reaosn I just like that his name is Steven. But neither have shown an interest, or spoken to me voluntarily, so that's out. I just liked 'em. And then there's this WEIRD skinny guy who serves at campus mass sometimes and he's in my drama class. Now he knows I go to mass cos I've caught him glaring at me several times (heh think Snape) but at class he says hey to the girl sitting right next to me, and studiously ignores me. Strange git. 

You know. I think it's me. Cos I seriously do not speak to guys unless I need something for class. I'm afraid to. I honestly don't know why but I'm literally afraid to. And when I do talk to them, I must seem so abrasive and abrupt - but its cos I'm fucking painfully shy! heh. a right conundrum. Not that guys actually speak to me voluntarily. You know. I think that any contact I've had with blokes over the years is fucked up. Cos only Shanaka and baba see me as a real person. Two boys. For any other guy it was cos I was smart, so I could help them. I'm 19. This really isn't helping when Rahel and Nissie all talk about going out with guys and who said they looked hot and all that shite. Ah fuck. I can't solve it. I dunno what's going to change that heh.  I'm stupid. Arrogant prolly. Not very approachable. 

In other news I'm doing sketch plans for the independent drawing. Since that's to be in-class it's not all that big. But I want to do good so it matches the standard of the triptych. And I've a Drama exam next week, for which I have like 5 new plays to read, and look over the other 6. Going to a play with some of the class and Prof. Gobert after the exam. Then on Friday next, Rahel wants me to go to a dance with her cos she's required by House Council to attend. There'll be booze there. But I've nothing to wear. Cos like I'm skinnier now, and I didn't bring anything formal skinny clothes. And I know I'll just be sitting there drinking all night, saying nothing, and getting depressed until we go home. $15 to attend. Not decided.  

Pride and Prejudice isn't on at the cinemas close by. I was SO ANGRY. I've been looking forward to that break for two weeks, just chilling with Alex, doing some window shopping and then seeing this grand film. Now it's all messed up :( Hehe and not to mention she hasn't rung. So she'll prolly cancel. Fun. I'll just be vodding all by my lonesome tomorrow evening. Though I could so work instead of going out with her. It's just I needed the break. Ah well. night night. 'm tired. baba didn't come online."

"event","soooooo. that's sort of the end of assignments except exams. 

i had to give in my VISA essay on monday - turned out a little long, but let's hope she doesn't think its all shite. Mary did an all nighter and the morning before tutorial for it. I'm glad i had the weekend. My brain was mushy but i tried.

And then on Mon night i did colour compositions for The Three Panels of Hell.

Well they aren't, not now, but then I was thinking of them like it. I finally started them last night after panicking furiously. And stayed uptil 2.30. Then woke up at 7 AM because I couldn't stop wanting to finish it once and for all. Medium was coloured Conte on Stonehenge paper. size (because I'm that crazy) 23"" by 30"" (times 3). ish. she said minimum size per panel was a sheet of A4 so, I really went overboard on this one. Let's hope she appreciates it. I had to smudge everything by fingers, so much so that I had bright red swollen cracked fingertips today. IT HURT. I think they split a little. But yeah it all got done in surprisingly little time. around 9 hours for the whole thing. I'd thought it'd be longer. ah well. we'll see tomorrow. I really really hate con crit days. And JOY tutorial after, so I'll be coming home at around 7.40 pm. Laaaaaaate. 

Wonder if Jess will show. She didn't these past two weeks so i dunno. I feel stupid sitting there waiting for her, but ah well. 

The panels turned out amazing. Absolutely scarily amazing. ""Luminescent"" looks like light coming through stained glass windows - vibrant colour. ""Scintillating"" is 'sexy' according to Rahel. Organic loveliness. These rounded physical limbs rising like. And ""Ethereal"" is just pure light and colour - no forms at all. I was kind of dumbstruck when I saw the finished stuff cos I swear it wasn't me who made that. Seriously. That's from someone else way up there. 

I keep wanting to cook my special made-up dish but I'd have to go shopping to get corned beef, pasta sauce and a cucumber. And I think I want to lose it for a bit on Friday night. Just a little. May buy juice on the way home - noooobody knows the meaning of fresh juice here. At home it's like fresh fruit juice available everywhere. Hah I just want a little for my voddy, mate. And I'm supposed to go to Pride and Prejudice with Alex, but she hasn't rung. Hope she doesn't cancel.

And the conundrum of Prof. Gobert. He's summat else. really wow when he does his lecture stuff. Alternating between that and unbelievably cute funny camp stuff. heh he's something - if I fail the exam, at least i had fun at lecture.

Sam said some bloke at her office said I looked nice. Lol she made me blush silly git. Ahh I wish I wish. Just that someone'd say that here.  

I was really worried for Mama today and everyone. She was so frantic on the phone like - I know how hysterical she gets whenever she's flying, but I really wished I was home today. Either to keep house for Baba and Daddy or to pack Ma's stuff for her, and to run her errands and help her on the trip. Cos U. Nic is incapacitated, Clement will have to do everything, and there's a limit to how much he can do. I just wanted to be there for her. And she told me to say R and C so I did cos she asked me, and she forgot to. I hope so much that we are allowed Cukoo back. Everyone is. Like bated breath all over the scattered corners of the world that have relatives in it. I just want everything to go ok. 

So tired I can't see straight. I have to wake up to take pics of the works and to paper-wrap them for protection. Which will be funny cos I have no newsprint/spare paper. 

I looked skinny in the webcam today after doing the ****ing laundry. ba said i was a tendril lolled. i miss deed-deed.

ow ow ow ow owwwww. i came out as a star wars geek today. well i totally am. read all the books (HAVE all the books and the Mara Jade comic HA) and been in the fan fic for years. Rather a surprise today when watching ROTJ and find that Old Redeemed Anakin has been replaced with Hayden Christensen. Well I thought it fit better for me, especially after seeing what Anakin did in Episode III. I mean I'd read all that baaaaaad stuff about Anakin (truly a monster in the Empire's height of reign) but when you see it, it's different. Anyway, to just think of him as this comfy forgiven old guy really didn't sit right as I was watching ROTJ today. Putting him as H.C. really gave it the right perspective. The Good Anakin as when he was younger cos he was truly a bastard when he was older lol. I miss all my SW books. It's all at home. I think I've a couple of X Wing books here, but nothing else. I left Maia at home too. DAMN I want my bookses.

You know. I haven't read anything I personally wanted to read (i.e. a printed book) for ages. Very unlike me. Cos I used to read 2/3 books a week. I suppose it's the funds situation and the lack of a good fiction library on campus. They've got a HUGE research library but v. little fiction. I read fan fiction everyday, but lately I've noticed that I've started just wanting to read the really-well-written-adult-style-novel-length-fic. Like not the shorter ones, or the PWPs. I like if there's a pairing in it but I need super-developed-plot...like that fic that's H/D where Harry goes to the US and comes back. 'Transfigurations?' I think. The sheer complex spell work logic, and the lore and myth and teaching of magic in that fic was fantastic. And the prequel 'Night Blooming Heartsease'was grand too. Finding it really hard to get novel-length fic of that calibre. 

Fan fic is my life. I dunno. Really. Like these books/movies' universes are my life I guess. I've read everything I could I could possible on Star Wars (all the following printed fiction) before I even knew that this stuff was on the internet. It's so vital. Heh I suppose my lack of anything resembling a life contributes cos I read a lot at home, but it wasn't EVERYTHING. Here, it is absolutely essential. There's nothing else for me to do. Else I'd've gone mad by now. Not kidding about that. I'd be a collapsed emotional mess instead of a well-hidden-masked-emotional mess person w/o fan fic. How life changes.

"event","<P>So I remembered that I'd dreamt about E.C days this morning. First time in aaaaaages. I think I used to get those dreams more regularly at home in the summer, or last year at uni. D.C was actually few and far between. Despite some of the shite at E.C, I loved the feeling the building gave me. White huge pillars to hug lol. And those amazing skylights on the second floor. The sunshine just pouring in. And the ACOUSTICS, my god. the way single voices would echo across the hall. the piano I used to play after and before school in Rm 29 and Rm 30. omg the afterschool Art club/ Miss Morris/ dear old Russell/ Lavery/ Harris (Mullen). Everything happened then. The choir singing in the reception area, echoing in the most amazing acoustics with that opening to the second floor skylight - it sent shivers up your entire body to hear it. Ethereal.</P>
<P>And then I remembered it's Veteren's Day tomorrow. I remember so much history through Mr. T. All that WWI stuff we learnt. Shite. it's so weird to think of what was actually a really good part your life, and you know that at the time you thought it was shite. I know though, Years 9 and 10 were really good times then.</P>

"event","So...I had a good day...*waits for impending bad thing to happen* lol

I did the presentation and felt ridiculously happy after I did it. And my TA who gave me such a bad mark for my essay was surprised I think. Probably thought I was going to be dumber than shite. But HAH I made it funny. And she liked it. 

So after class, I come to see her with my next essay 3/4 done, just so she can look over it. And she says I can't understand your mark for your last essay, cos I read your presentation write-up, and heard it, and now I see your next essay, and it's good. I dunno. I think she realised that my mark shouldn't have been that bad, when she looked over it again, but she wouldn't change it. And I was upset about the grade, but mostly I was upset about her thinking I was really dumb, so that was ok-ish. 

After class, cos it's a really nice day today (if a bit nippy) I went down to the pond (more like a mini-lake within the university)and relaxed on a bench. Watched the clouds, and the autumn colours of the trees. And the ducks/seagulls/geese flapping and swimming. Thought about stuff.

And then came home and made sausages! yay! i'm a sausage mad person lol. 

Hah. I have work to do."

He's an only child, stuck way in Boston, far from all of us, so I think he's hungry for interaction. Though if Brent's was around, he'd run straight for him, rather than me. You see, the big problem is that I'm a GIRL....lol

PRESENTATION omg so scared. like I just want to do it. I have to wait all the way until 2.30! cripes. 

THIS WEEK: Presentation, prepare essays
NEXT WEEK: Hand in three essays, prepare essay and drawing
WEEK AFTER: Hand in one essay and drawing
WEEK AFTER 2: Hand in my entire drawing portfolio. Sit Drama exam.
WEEK AFTER 3: Sit Canadian Lit. exam, PACK, sit Film exam, LEAVE FOR HOOOOOME. yars

and that's so weird. cos i remembered just now, this morning when i was sleeping, and i woke up. stayed there awhile and then tried to get up, it was like i blacked out for 5 mins before trying to get out of bed. like you know when you faint you have this blackness, and no memory of what just happened. i opened my eyes and it was like dizzyness. weird. this chest tightness is worrying me, cos i didn't want to take more than 2 puffs."

Er, perhaps that's better annunciated as a downward spiral. Or a straight vertical drop even. I don't know how to cure it. And how to write well again. Cos it didn't seem like anything changed, really. I was myself when I wrote them. And edited well. And yet according to 2 T.A's they are shite. Prolly are real shite, that I know, and I've come to terms with it. But for someone who's never gotten bad grades before, I don't know how to fix it. Cos nothing's changed in my life since I wrote them.

Went to the ROM today. such stuff. i could not properly comprehend it, there were too many ppl but suffice to say, i have never been in a real museum. it kind of blew me away. i put on makeup - like really kohl-ed the eyes - not like the artsy way i normally do it, but thick sexy stuff. i wanted to. btw, i had a little summat before writing this post to scuse me if i ramble.

professor gobert is wow. he has this way of weaving this spell when he's in the class room with you. and when in lecture he's so funny and overtly camp. but seemingly gentle in tutorial. he seems cool. it's amazing how cold i felt towards richie though. like usually i love her in class - she's so funny and rambly and nice. but since last week it's like i despise her. and suddenly like gobert. ah well. 

why do i measure my worth by boys? well i don't measure it fully by boy's attention cos otherwise i'd've killed myself by now, but sometimes it really hurts. no guy has ever talked to me here. hardly. maybe 2 in the last year. none this term at all. it must be me right? cos i know i dunno how to talk to guys. and maybe it's what i look like/ how i dress/ my overall presence - i just want to know what it is! and then maybe i can fix it. who'm i kidding? i can't fix bloody 19 years of nothing. 

everything is just so fucked. and it's like i'm so alone. not even my family gives a shite. ha, i'm the one who thinks about them all the time, its not the other way round. i can't get everything done. and get good marks. i'm crying everyday. i dunno how to stop. i never do it outside my room, cos it'd would be like a cry for attention. it's not. it's just i don't know how to make everything ok.  it's like it never will be."

"event","ok so i have to do my readings. i'm sooooooo behind it's unbelievable. and it is effing freezing today. i was almost blown away and my fingers went dead. i saw a poor seagull being flung off his course, poor fellow's trying to fly against it.

so cos its cold i try on my old old winter jackets from when i was skinny (cos all i wore last year was this one jacket that was HUGE) cos i want to look better in winter. lol they fit! even a little big like. hhehehe.

hm. in other news, in lecture I suddenly remembered Dr. Lewis from D.C - the teacher so (apparently) lecherous he got told to leave cos he was carrying on with one of the girls. And he had a wife and 2/3 kids (his wife was Brent's music teacher at DESS). I dunno, why he came into my mind though. I remembered so clearly this moment in class there when we were listening to him, then the chatter began. And Lily (v. pretty) said she was cold (it was always freezing there-heh you had to bring your jumpers in cos it was cold *inside*). And then Dr. Lewis got his humongous jacket and stood behind her chair and put it over her shoulders. Now if it had been any other teacher, it would've been different. he wouldn't have done it that way. But this guy...when he did it the whole class went silent, like this hushed pause. Again, I don't know why he came into my head. Particularly that moment...

Bird flu is scaring me. I'm really worried about my baby, I hope there's some sort of preventative measure the vet's may offer. I've asked ma to ring, cos it's really worrying. My poor boy. And my dreams aren't helping - I've had 2 horrible horrible ones where he's dying or in great pain, or he's trapped and I can't get to him. Hence, my worried-ness..."

<P><lj-cut text=""cut for angsty stuff""> In the Art History lecture today something weird happened. The lady below me (tiered seating) was a T.A and she had just got coffee in the break. So I sit back down and the smell comes wafting up to me - I immediately began having a mini anxiety attack. The smell was the exact same coffee they use on the plane coming here, every single time. It really upset me, I was like omg what's happening. See, on the planes here it's awful - I know where it's going, my body is aching for home, and when the lights go off, i'm trying really hard not to sob, so i don't disturb my neighbour. Put that with the stuffy atmosphere of the plane and the feeling that you're in a caged hell, or going straight to one, and you get what I remembered when I smelled that coffee today. Or rather what my mind and body remembered. It's as if my body started reacting to this thing, I immediately became distressed and I couldn't control it. I was so glad the lights were dimmed so we could see the slides, so no one could see me. That return to that horrible time flipped me out completely. I've been a little on edge all day. It's funny how your body remembers things you'd rather forget. God no wonder I hate Paris.</P>

Bulges aren't as apparent as they were before, but they still exist lol. Still humming the hymns. I'm thinking of joining the church choir - there are only 6 of them, but they are very good at harmony. Been ages since I really sang (my God since D.C!). I miss it, but my breath work is in shambles. I'll ask about it maybe. I dunno, i only know one of the girls, and she's one of those super sweet ppl, who are nice, but don't really care? unsure. Maybe if one of them has a keyboard and music, i could contribute that way? I want to be actively involved in music, after a whole year of not doing anything. Going to mass last week was like heaven, simply because I got to sing and be a part of music again. Grr. I dunno what to do, cos its the only music option on campus available.

"event","<P>omg I don't know what it is about Rahel. &nbsp;We can sit there and talk for <EM>hours</EM>. like last night we talked for over 2 and a half hours until almost 2 AM. Now I'm dizzy sleepy, though i woke up only at 9 15. I ran again last night cos I'd inadvertently eaten a piece of sweet potato. Alex brought me Thanksgiving food! Turkey, stuffing, omg I miss T. Prissi's stuffing, pumpkin (they don't make it like Granny) peas, red beans, and sweet potato. See, it was right next to the pumpkin and was mushed up and orange like it, so I ate it, only realising after about the different taste. Crappy.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And I met Carly yesterday too. She isn't like my roomie, and I think maybe it's good thatI have Rahel this year. She and I can talk, but its not like me and Rahel, where usually, we are on the same wavelength. Hehe she said to come over to her new place to do shots. I'm like ok, but they have drugs at ther place, so I don't want to go. Hheheh Rahel said she'd do shots with me, but only diluted ones of vodka. I hope she doesn't feel like I'm forcing her to drink. I don't want to do it if she thinks that...darrrrn I dunno.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My body's aching now after exercising. And it was barely anything, cos I didn't do the second half, cos Rahel heard me and asked if something was wrong and then we started to talk. I wanted to do 'weights' as well - lol my Art history text is HUGE omg so heavy. So I can use it as 'weights'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I want to see Domino this weekend. I need to clean. I'm tired. I've got a feeling Rahel will leave at the end of the year - like she'll go to Guelph, or she'll move back with her family. I'm screwed then for a roomie. yay. And I didn't know York was a second rate (or worse uni) I truly didn't - apparently they take everyone in. Heck do you think Mama would have sent me here if she knew. It makes you feel horrid cos it's like you're working for a degree hard, and you're paying intl student fees and it's so expensive. And then it's not worth it. Kinda crushed here :(</P>

"event","<P>Why is it I always cry at Mass. or sort of get teary like. I dunno. The new Father's a bit odd. Seems like the white version of Father Cyprian. Speaking of which I really wanted to hear Father Augustine talk. He was so charismatic at Porta and now he's in Dubai. Phil said hi, and said come see him. Dunno what for, he never took an interest last year. I guess he feels he has to since he's got Maja's job now. Not that she took an interest last year either. Lets see how long he sticks around - not long I bet. Too awkward. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I'm getting this feeling all the time. Like the moment I'm out anywhere, listening to lecture, to the sermon to anything, all I say in my head is ""I want to go home"" over and over. I can't think why it attack me then. I hate this shit. Tuesday will be eventful cos I've to give in the essay, then meet Alex cos she wants to give me food, and then see Phil. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I have so much laundry to do. Father Allen eh - well that would take care of the accent I guess, cos he had this Irish rounding to his words (Lavery and Gleeson took care of that for me). He said something in the sermon about ""don't listen to the urgent, but listen to the important"" - I think that was a poor choice of words, but I got what he meant I think. YOu know I couldn't care less about the stupid computer or materialistic things, or the new comp at home. I just want to be there. I couldn't care if we lived in a shack. I just want to be home Lord, that's all. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""weird idiot me""> I'm glad Father Dan's not here, ok not glad, but its nice i don't have to see him. Lol after confession at Easter he looked at me funny. Or treated me different, I dunno. Prolly just me I guess, nothing with him. I miss home Lord. I just want someone to care where I lay my head each night. Or what I'm doing, or what I'm eating like Daddy. I just want someone to give a shit, maybe it would make this a bit more bearable.</P>"

"event","<P>Nothing to update that much. I now have a nice full length mirror which makes me look skinny - lol always a plus really. I'm going to start soup diet soon, just to get an edge. Trying to get into exercising but I have no energy. I think I feel good after I've done it, but to actually start doing it is the problem. I was really into running earlier this term, but that seems to have fizzled. Ah well. </P>
<P>Onto comp news. I have new low quotes with Monitor! One from a place in Markham (a)- for around $1330 plus tax and one near Finch station (b) for $1363.94. And it comes to $1568.53 with tax. This is the quote from Canada computers - I was recommended to these ppl twice so I'm inclined to go for it despite the $30 extra. But see the thing is that (a) said if you get it from us it'll be with a $50 thingy to buy in-store stuff. So I'm really getting a good deal from the (a) ppl. The only BIG problem is that they're all the way in Markham and I'm stuck at York. Should anything go wrong with the comp there's no easy way to get it to these ppl. So I guess I'm going with CC at Finch for $30 more and no giftie thing. I wish I knew someone who had a car, but all the ppl I know depend on their parents/siblings for car travel. </P>
<P>I had such shocks when re-looking at the comp today though. My God - I had to change the motherboard, cos it wouldn't fit the casing, then worry that the processor I picked would burn out the casing, then think shite I need a heatsink, but it costs too much. The whole comp surprisingly, with tax, comes to 1000 Dhs less than what we paid for our Dubai comp. Which makes me wonder at the mark-up for Dubai's 'lowcostcomputereverything' - because the guy we used was much less than what others were charging. Hmm. </P>
<P>I know a laptop would be wayyy less fuss, but it also comes at literally double the price for the features I want. Some don't even <EM>have</EM> the features I want, and cost like $10-13,000 Dhs for that. So I know I want a desktop. Now I have the price for it. Now I have to decide should I really get it or not. Cos I'm using the parents' money that was actually for courses, but I dropped a couple, so I have the&nbsp;money. But should I use it for what&nbsp;<EM>I</EM> want&nbsp;instead of tuition next year/food/emergency money. Cos I don't really <U>need</U> this computer. I just want it so I can finally do my gaming and listen to my music and just have all the features my laptop doesn't have - like with the monitor and stuff. So it's just this thing I 'want' - not needed. Parents said ok fine, we'll get you a new laptop in April cos this one is on its way out (cos I use it like a desktop and its 4 yrs old). So I do need a new comp. It's just that I feel guilty, and the parents' said April, and I dunno what to do. Now or what?</P>"

I've been sending quotes left right and centre. I finally got a decent deal, but they don't seem to have my casing. I want that cube! ok price is, including Viewsonic monitor and tax: $1846. Which is better that everyone else's at 2000$+. But I had to give up my 2 GB DDR2 RAM for that. I'd get 1 GB now, and the 6600 Geforce Graphics card. I think these ppl will be good, depending on those other places I asked for quotes from. That 'Signa' guy is charging too much. But I keep thinking about DEll! if I get the Dimension 9150 inclusive of monitor, shipping, tax and a better graphics card I get it for $2297. I guess I'm saving $400 if I get it made, but it looks like such a sweet deal. 

And I keep forgetting to press 'update'. Lol it is now 10.03 AM"

I want to go to Walmart that's apparently at Dufferin for a mirror and stuff. I wish me and my roomie had more in common. We can talk I guess, that's good. But she is soooo different. Er, oh yeah I went to the Menezes today. Mrs. M is so kind, and so strong, poor woman. She and hubby truly made me welcome. I hope God heals her soon, she's such a good woman. And it's good that both Stacy and Melissa are easy to get along with. Both are such rakes though. I felt like a barrel walking along with Mel. And this taped up mirror next to me didn't help so I'm hopefully getting a new one. I want home so much again. Er, weird how the M's home is starting to feel like a familiar place to me. I wish I had my own place sooooo bad. I hope that if I do get steady part time work, I could get my own place.  poopoopoop. Nice chickpeas."

"event","Life is tainted by so many horrible things. Well, not horrible, just unwanted perhaps. I make it sound like these things come into one's path completely out of the blue, and the worst part is, is that they don't. You make the choice. You make the choice whether or not you want to do these things, and end up feeling hmmm. Polluted I guess. And as much as you'd like to think ok, it wasn't your fault, you had no idea it'd be like that, why didn't you run away/ stop at the first inkling. I'm rambling. There are so many things that I wish I could change about today. Not really bad or awful things, just things I wish I'd judged better. 

I'm starting to list my food now. Well, I ate sausages today so I've listed what I can eat on the weekend. I wish I didn't feel guilty when I eat something. Like today for instance. I ate nothing except tea and a wee square of melba toast. so when I came home by 7 30 pm I was starving, and I ate ham and cheese. But now, when I remain hungry the whole day, that doesn't satisfy me. I think it would have, had I let it settle for half an hour, but after eating that I was still in a hunger frenzy like. Like all I could think of was this pain in my head and my tummy. so I fried sausages and ate 4 medium sized chubby sausages - these aren't franks, these are english 'bangers' or thick brekkers sausages. But now around 2 or more hours later I still feel like I shouldn't have eaten anything. It's like at the time I'm in this painful achy frenzy, and then after I feel guilty, for having a full tummy. Weird. Messed up.

Er. Hmmmm. I'm tired. My drawing was crap. Well not crap, but compared to others it was crap. I felt so ashamed, and that's kind of bad when you know you've put work into it. I think I'd've put even more work into it if I'd known what to look for or what I was aiming for. She didn't take them to mark anyway, she just said to rework them if you want to. But that still didn't spare you that humiliation you know. And I know con crit isn't 'bad' and it's good for you, but if it just makes you feel awful, and all you seem to get out of it is that you and your work suck, then how good is it. 

Again I miss home. I miss it at really odd times. I suppose it was worse last year but now it doesn't seem like a lesser pain. Just different, more subtle. You flare up suddenly, get angry, and start thinking WHY WHY ME like a fool. And it'll be anywhere. In the middle of lecture, tutorial, when someone's speaking to you. You start to like hurt. Not hurt more ache I think. Like this twist inside you. It gets worse when you go to your room and you're alone. I suppose you could go seek someone out but why burden them? They've got enough on their plates. And what's weird is how sudden these mood swings happen. Cos you'll feel like you can handle stuff 2/3 hrs before, and bam you're sobbing/ angry/completely low soon after. I miss home so much. Just for my sanity if nothing else. In these four walls you feel like you'll go mad. Maybe you won't at that very moment but you're on the cusp.

I'm tired. And there's no one I can say that too. No one to put me to bed or to say good night, or I care where you lay your head to sleep. It's weird in a Western/ Canadian mentality that at 19 you still need your family/ your mum/ your brother/ your dad. But in our way, I guess, Goan or just our family way, we are always 'joined' somehow. I wonder sometimes if it is just me who misses it, and whether they give a shite at home. They do I know, but not in a 24/7 way that I do. You see they still have their lives at home. They say, everyone says I've got a life here, and I've got to make it through here, and Canada is a life. But it isn't, it truly isn't. It's nothing. And I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, what I feel right now. It hurts bad, but what hurts worse is knowing it'll never fully go away.

I'm tired Jesu. And I want to go home please."

Hmmmm

Well I kinda actually like my job at The Great Escape (gaspeth) Like my fellow cashiers a lot =D so at least I'm getting along with people.  I'm getting a little better with my chemical knowledge, as well as how to hook up a sand filter if you have a main drain.  Go me.

Paul and I are doing wonderful, like how we used to do before he dumped me for that dumb girl.  I'm madly in love with this guy and sometimes I don't know what to do with myself because of it.  I want to be with him constantly, and well usually I am with him constantly.  I love him.

I kinda miss a few of my friend (ie, blissa, trish, joey, you know who you are)  So yeah, ask me to hang out sometime soon, it would be appreciated.  Well, if you want to see Paul cuz he'll most likely tag along.

I got a new piercing... sort of a modified conch dealy <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v315/diablo_cuddi/Amanda150.jpg"">

You met a guy, you really like.  He treats you very well, wonders how your day goes.  Calls to ask you how you're feeling.  Hugs you when you're sad.  Smiles with you when you're happy.  You fell in love.  

He dumped you, for four months.

One day he started talking to you again.  You tried your hardest to hate him.  You couldn't.  But you could make him feel bad about the horrible decsision he made.  Time goes on, you start to see him again and realize why you loved him in the first place.  But your family, the ones who NEVER ASK YOU WHAT THE FUCK IS UP, hate him.  Try to get you to dump him.  Ask things like ""What possessed you to go back out with him?"" or say ""He's ugly, you can do better.""

Well, people, I ask you this.  How can one do better that see someone who seems to give a fuck about how one feels?

I'm stressed out.  About everything.  It's effecting my mood, my appetite, my sleeping.  I constantly have a headache and constantly feel like <i>somethings wrong</i>.  Hell, I COULD be crazy.  Or I might just have something wrong.

I can't stand not having a job.  It's killing me, not having money.  No way to pay bills, besides having mommy and daddy take care of it.  I feel horrible asking my parents who don't have money to take care of my money problems.  The stress is getting to me too, I'm acting differently around people I was once at ease with.  I'm probably going to fuck up my relationship with Ben, in no time flat.  I'm ignoring most of my family.  I also see little point in going out on the weekends.

The stupidity of all of this is getting to me.

I need a job, I need to move out.

Living with 7 other people (two of which under the age of 5) is making me go insane!  And the fighting... the constant fighting.  I can't stand this anymore.

I almost wish that my family DID have to move to Florida, and I could just stay here."

"event","Ok, Kiddies, guess it's time for concert talk.&nbsp; First off I'd like to say, I went to the show not to see KMFDM but to see CombiChrist.&nbsp; Not that I'm upset about KMFDM at all, no no no.&nbsp; In fact I left the HOB with a whole new appreciation for the band.&nbsp; They are truely amazing.&nbsp; I guess they'd have to be amazing to play a 23 song set, and no one gets bored at all.

But fuckin CombiChrist, was just simply.&nbsp; Amazing.&nbsp; Wonderful.&nbsp; They are my new favorite band.&nbsp; Andy L has spectacular stage presence.&nbsp; I was in awe.&nbsp; Not to mention, HE'S BEAUTIFUL.&nbsp; It was kinda funny, during ""Enjoy the Abuse"", Paul pulled on my dog collar the entire time as if to say ""hey, this bitch enjoys the abuse.""&nbsp; Anyways, about 4 or 5 times, andy left the stage, and stood on the railing and touched me.&nbsp; Well his crotch touched me.&nbsp; The only draw back of being in the very front.&nbsp; Oh wait, I lied, it also sucked having my ribs being smushed into the railing while 130984712904357825 people tried to take my sweet spot.&nbsp; 

Everyone go listen to CombiChrist"

I love that I don't have to worry about anything he does, he can handle himself maturely so I don't have to be with him for everything.

I love that I can tell him a guy is hot and he'll agree. And the other way around as well. Yes, other people are attractive, denying it is ridiculous and shows a serious weakness. But knowing that he chooses me over size zero push-up bra, and I choose him over muscles to here guy, is a serious ego boost.


Sorry. Just randomly had a mad-props to the RJ moment. He's my masculine rock, Emily being my feminine. *lol*

I'm fine through the whole thing until Betty Ford got escorted in. I bawled. Not because of the president status, but seeing a newly made widow after 58 years of marriage. It was well placed perspective for me.

It was so weird to hear them talk about Grand Rapids on national television though.. I was like ""hey, I know that place.""

I'll do my makeup in the parking lot at work.

"event","So. I don't usually make new years resolutions. But there are a few things I wanna commit to.

1. Lose 10-15 pounds. I mostly just wanna wear hot pants *lol* I won't join a club because I won't commit to it, I live on the third floor so I can't do DDR like I used to. So it looks like yoga (again) and good ol' fashion running. (the cemetary is scenic.. or something)

2. Talk less about myself. Sounds simple enough. I'm just not interested in what a lot of other people have to say usually. My goal is to at least pretend to.

3. Take more time to focus on my artwork. Since I've graduated, I've only churned out 5 1/2 paintings and 2 sketches whereas I used to pump out a painting and 4 sketches every month or so. But my computer graphics are through the freakin' roof!

4. Stop being mean to myspace-dependant kids. It's not their fault they can't make real friends. Ok so that wasn't really a resolution. I just wanted to randomly rant. And no, I won't add your ass if I don't know you.

4.(the real 4) Don't let stupid people get to me. Even if they're total, complete idiots because the truth is staring them in the face and they still deny it and argue about it. Some people just need to argue because they have no life.

5. Make more time for people who want to chill with the Mac-dawg. It seems like everytime somebody wants to do something, I'm busy with something. I don't know how to make myself more available considering I work 6 days a week.... but I will certainly pay attention to opportunities.

6. Quit impulse buying. Did I really need to buy that talking parrot toy from goodwill just because it had the pirate symbol on it? *debates with self* No. I've had it for a few months and haven't even put batteries in it.

7. Drive to Texas, kidnap Taylor, and Ally. Drive to Mass. marry Hil. ~fin~ ok not really

7. (ok for real) Finish Hilary's portrait.


That was more than I intended. My focus is on one and two though."

It may have been short notice. But wow. She looked so happy. She told us that it originally was going to be the pastor, her, emmit, and RJ and I. I couldn't tell if she was joking or not. She looked effin serious.

Anyways, it was about 25 people I'd say. Amanda looked amazing. I could have bet money that she'd have flowers in her hair, we talked about her obsession with that before. I told myself I wouldn't cry, then I saw her and lost it *lol*

The reception was at the same place I had my open house and you could tell that she didn't have a lot of friends there. The girl that was her best friend in high school hardly even talked to her. I was like.. huh.. that's weird. She hung out with us a lot which was sweet. 

And then she gave me the bouquet. I was like... really? I thought I was gonna cry. I didn't have to fight for it, I got picked. *lol* No, but I really felt special to be picked like that.

It all made me realize how much I miss that bitch. We need to hang out more because when we did, we clicked I think. And that doesn't happen to kenzie very often. I gots like... Emily and Amanda that clicked. It's probably the throbbing psychohyperbitch vain.

Anyways, she looked really happy and Emmit seems really nice. I had a great time seeing her and feeling all important-like. 

It's still all so surreal. Even she was like... ""wow. I'm married."" But really, they make a good couple.

And of course, I made a slideshow.

She called RJ today. She's getting married TOMORROW! WTFHAMSANDWHICH! So... I'm still currently like... umm wtf.

So yeah... I'll be in ionia tomorrow at 5 for a wedding, then a reception.

Which also means I get to go shopping today.. on Black fuckin friday... I'ma tear up some charlotte russe. I've been eyein' some dresses there and now I have an excuse to get one. Fuck yeah.

.... wtf, I'm going to a wedding tomorrow?

I love Amanda. I'd be disappointed if she did things the normal way. *lol*

Pictures to follow.

So let's review appropriate wedding attire.

I'm assuming this will be informal to semi-formal.. soo.... cocktail dress.
DON'T WEAR WHITE
DON'T WEAR BLACK or sequins to a DAYTIME wedding... (this one starts at 5, so I could probably wear black?)
Nothing too flashy (too many patterns, too much skin, etc.)
Wear something feminine

Phew. So it sounds like pretty much anything from charlotte russe that isn't white. *lol*"

So now she's died her hair black and I left this comment on her myspace about it.


""Lauren, I am concerned about your well being. Dying your hair black definitely means you are clinically depressed and in need of severe counseling. Please don't try to kill yourself. *bursts into laughter*""


and here's what she wrote back after commenting on the picture of me and em in our rocky horror costumes

""I realize your concern for my dramtastic choice of hair color and I will try to resist the temptation of suicide. However..the thought does cross my mind when I see this picture and realize that I am related to you...""

"event","Have I mentioned that I absolutely love our new laptop? K cuz I do.

My last laptop was a gateway and I beat the shit out of it and I can still go over and turn it on and put the sims on it. It's never needed any work except the occasional reboot, but that's normal. I wouldn't change a thing about this laptop and we got a really good deal on it. We looked at the 1300 ones and they just didn't compare. I don't need a damn thumbscanner, thanks. That was seriously the only thing that this didn't have that the others did. LOVE. 

I don't, however, love comcast. The internet still isn't right and this will be the sixth time they've been out to ""fix"" it. I'm really fuckin' sick of it.

Our cool neighbors, (the ones that are moving to CA. Came back from his dad's to visit us a couple days ago. They took us out for ice cream *lol* They called today to ask us to watch skoshi, their littlest kitty, until the 24th. He's about the size of loki, aka, baby kitty. She's currently asleep on the top shelf of the kitty tower, mostly hanging off of it.

On a much more serious note.

RJ's grandpa is in the hospital. I guess a couple days ago, he was complaining about really bad knee pain and nobody could convince him to get it looked at. Then they take him to the hospital a few days later, and last night he started to go paralyed. His son was telling us about it at the hospital today. I guess he was in the room and all of a sudden, piece by piece, he went numb. He's now numb from the neck down. He went into surgery last night, turns out he got a bacteria infection from a shot a few weeks ago. The bacteria is the second hardest to fight but lives on our skin naturally. He got a cortisone shot and when the shot went in, the bacteria got pushed in and it immeadiately attacks the weakest joint available. HIs grandpa had neck surgery in 1975 and that is what it attacked. He was sleeping today after no sleep for four days but we were able to take a peek at him and it's just like...wow... that's the guy who just gave me a hug at christmas. His spine wasn't severed by the bacteria so he still has a chance. And I guess he can signal with his head some communication and responds to people coming into his room and is completely there mentally. He's a tough guy and we're hoping for the best. He is in intensive care on the neurological floor so it's pretty insane right now.


So yeah. Heavy and stuff."

Hmm... something interesting... Found a sega game gear at goodwill today for $7. They also had sonic 2 for it and we somehow didn't get charged for it. Sweet.

Got pictures done today. I thought we were just doing a group picture with RJ's siblings. 

I was dead wrong.

We did a group picture, then there was a picture of just the siblings, then a picture of me and RJ, then a picture of each of us individually. I guess I'm kinda happy about it. I can hijack one of the ones of me and RJ and distribute it to my grandma, my dad, and my ajah parents. I just hate getting pictures done. I feel like a tool. And this guy had me posin' all weird. meh, we'll see. I'm not payin' for 'em so what do I care? *lol*

Oh, finally got around to making new icons for the Journal. The one today comes courtesy of a young Mr. Kiebler himself. He apparently likes the way the bottom of the bowl tastes.

Still obsessed with the pirate board. Apparently the harry potter one is starting back up. This is their third residence, so I'm leary of getting too attached. I'll just play my mandatories right now. I've been recruited to RP one of the basic canon characters. Apparently is unanimous that I'd be good at RPing one of the Weasley twins *lol*

Almost 60 members at the board. And that's after deleting the inactive ones. *squeeee* One of my characters is male and I found a thread discussing him and they think he's rped by a guy. So apparently I cover well. 

Hmm what else. Emily informed me that GVSU is putting on Rocky Horror Picture show and she's auditioning. Even if she doesn't make it, I'm going. And there are others planning on going too. They all plan to wear leather or other such items *lol* Oh I love my G.R. chicks. Their the only ones crazy enough to fit my style.

OH Emily and Marley made it into Ionia Idol. Yeah.. I'm reaaaaal surprised*~ (~ means sarcasm. A old board member and I came up with it *lol*) So I'll have to make it out to that. They perform on seperate days which could be tricky, but I'll check my schedule and make it to at least Emily's.

Jack is RJ's best friend. I always felt bad because Neko is a HUGE momma's bitch and Jack tends to wanna hang out with RJ. RJ comes home from work and Jack immeadiately walks over and lays on his lap. Them snuggling in bed is one of the cutest things I've ever seen.

Pirates was awesome. It was fun goin' to a movie with Wes and Emily. That doesn't happen too often. We had a bonfire afterwards and it was mostly making fun of Kenzie's roasting skills, and RJ and Emily dorking it out. I'd have been more interested if I wasn't buzzin' like a street lamp in saranac. Somethin' about sailor moon is all I can remember.

Oh and I have to remember to rock the miniskirt and leggings next time I'm gonna see Wes. Apparently he doesn't like that combo, but I like to annoy him. It's fun.

Then, we have a wedding anniversary to go to, then we're hanging out with RJ's family again. We were there last night for craft night. Well I was there for craft night. RJ was there for moral support.

I effin love craft night.. and not for the crafts. The projects start out nice and martha stewarty and about 5 minutes into it you hear ""God dammit!"" ""How the fuck am I supposed to do that?!"" and so on. It's second only to basement/campfire/garage parties with the majh and fajh. Seriously.

Anyways, there's gonna be a campfire, poolness, and possibly even a rock climbing wall at the family thing tomorrow. My sibs don't know they're going yet, so that should be interesting.

We let hobokitty spend the night the other night. He slept right in the bed, between me and RJ. Apparently he eats in his sleep or something because he gnawed on RJ all night. He's the sweetest kitty and I'd adopt his ass in a second. I've haven't seen him since yesterday morning when he was sleeping on a pile of leaves, he didn't wanna come in either. But he's usually out and about for a couple days, then he comes back and waits on the porch for someone to let him into the building. Neko let us know how much he really loves us the day after hobo left *lol*.

We were supposed to go kayaking with the neighbors the other day. Yes... KAYAKING. Our neighbors are the freakin' shiz. 

Well.. it's back to doing my hair hell.... I don't know how much longer I can grow it.. I wanna cry.

"event","I am sad. 

I lost a goldfish today. Raoul died. I just got done crying. It was bad because I knew he looked he sick and I was worried about him.. I was my fault, I think I hurt him in transit to the new place and new fish tank. I can't believe I cried over a damn fish.

On the topic of animals. I'm not too sure on how much of a hobo, hobocat is.... I'm gonna sit back and observe/talk to the neighbors a little more about it first.. there seems to be possibly a second stray around too.

The move has had a strange effect on Totoro... He's gone from reserved and bratty too... Loveable.. .like.. annoyingly cute loveable. It's gone from us not leaving him alone, to HIM not leaving US alone. Not that I'm upset or anything.. It was just sudden.

More good news about the neighbors. Yesterday, they came beating on our door at 8:30 asking us what we were doign for dinner, unfortunately, we'd already eaten :( 

We caught the guy on his way to see X-men. An apparent fan. *lol*

Hmm.. what else

Trying to get settled in here. got a good amount of boxes sitting around still. I broke the garbage disposal today, but luckily we haven't submitted the apartment condition report yet, so I wrote it down *lol*

..I don't really have much to update... RJ said I was movin' around too much in bed so I got up so he could sleep. That's what I get for staying up until 3:45 the previous night on a new RP board. ~*Lame*~

SO yeah, I'm gonna give the sleep thing a second shot, now that RJ is certainly in a deep sleep. At least he doesn't snore. Usually."

When we moved in, we met the neighbors. I don't believe there is anyone over thirty in our building. The girl under us said don't worry about being loud cuz' she's loud too. (which, she hasn't been as of yet, and it IS the weekend. The people across from her offered to help us move, but we were almost done. Later, they offered us pizza.

We haven't formally met the person across from us, but RJ recognizes her as the sales associate at gamestop. Lovely. 

I will post pictures later after the boxes clear up a bit.

We also have a resident kitty. I will be making a big post about that later. But here's a preview. A little kitty needs a home badly. He's verrrrry sweet and the residents here affectionately call him ""hobo kitty"" nobody can find a home for him and he's on the skinny side. Everyone here feeds him when they can, but he really needs a home. Or even a foster home until a permanent place is found. If anyone's interested, or no someone who is, please please please let me know. I'll post pictures of him later when I take the time to scrounge him up.. and when I find my camera.

I cannot walk. No seriously. Every piece of furniture had to travel up 4 flights of stairs to reach their final destinations. I was walking like an alien from the movie.. well.. Aliens. It hurts so bad. 

Will have a party soon. Gotta go. More unpacking to be done."

For some reason, I thought I had to leave here at 11 to get to work at noon. I've been doing this for a year.. I should know I don't leave until 11:30. But sweet! I've got a lot of extra time. So I'll waste it here vs. packing.

RJ got paid like $30 an hour yesterday because of holiday pay. Sadly, they kicked him out after he got his guaranteed 4 hours.. that sucked. Loren didn't even go in. Which completely blows my mind. It's hard for me to feel sorry for him when he doesn't even bother to go into work when he'd get pay for TWO DAYS. Not my problem, not my problem.

Went over to Bradley's yesterday. I was really looking forward to going, but somewhere between getting ready and driving over there, my energy went poop. All I wanted to do was curl up sleep! It was extremely pathetic. It's sad because get togethers like that are a sudden rarity.

I think I'm just wiped out physically and mentally because of what's going on right now: hot and humid weather, painted Momma-c's for 7 1/2 hours, apartment is making me crazy, moving anxiety, new place anxiety, vacation soon.. etc. etc. etc. I can't wait to be good ol' me again.

Emily, we found 2 more items for your pirate collection. I'm holding them ransom for the next time we hang out. 

Anybody not working thursday? Come out and help us move *lol* it's just me and RJ again. We've made it work in the past, but it just sucks *lol*

My vacation starts tomorrow. So does the rabid packing. I've packed all I could, now it's laundry laundry laundry, and packing essentials (silverware, bathroom stuff, clothes.)

Moving sucks.

Emily got to move today. Lucky bitch.

So RJ's mom called this morning to ask if we could come over and help move a couch. So we did. Turns out she was painting the living room.. by herself. So of course we decide we're gonna help. Figure we can just do a little here and there and be done with it.

7 and a half hours later. We're done *lol* But RJ got payment. He got to drive his stepdad's Nova.. which he's been asking to do for years. So that was pretty cool.

I'm all tingly with moving excitement! I'm looking forward to 110% less stress. Not to mention the health benefits of moving work. I bought my running shoes, now we just need to get RJ's after we move. 

I work tuesday and that's it until the following tuesday. Vacation time.

I broke the news to my brother that he'd be coming with RJ and I to cedar point. I think he peed  a little. Em is coming with us during halloweekends. Which I actually prefer, so it all worked out for the best. Which is rare.

We found a sweet shelf at goodwill. I've been put on a designing spree *lol*

It's not a very good picture. He runs fast. He's about an inch tall and an inch and a half wide. Emily, if Thor layed on his side, he'd be that size.

My justification for getting Antonio? If Em can get something ugly and slightly dangerous, so can I. Dammit. Oh and he was $1.99 and he had enough from out bottle return for him :)

On the theme of ripping off emily. I'm gonna work on some new LJ avs featuring things other than my mug. It's hard to pick an appropriate av for angry when all of yours are of your happy face, or constantine's gyrations. Kind of moots the point.

Moving le SOOOON! Next thursday! I go on vacation starting may thirty-onest until June 5th.

Cedar point trip will soon follow. Em, if you're going, you may want to enlist a ride partner. If you're not going.. well fuck you and I'll take my siblings.

On that topic... RJ plays Dnd on thursday, so he can't watch OC with me, he waits for the season to come out on dvd. Well after season finale this week. Loren comes home and walks in , ""So I hear they killed off marisa?"" After RJ and I had just discussed him not wanting to know. I thought I might punch him. Still pissed about that.

Birthday was the normal birthday and all that implies. Went to craft night tonight and made a shitload of shit for shit and stuff. 

Ummm.... No b-day party until next month... umm

RJ sent me flowers at work! That was very very nice of him. Every girl likes to get flowers, I don't care what anyone says/thinks. It's a common fucking desire for cryin' out loud. *shakes head* Anyways..

My sister called me at midnight on the 17th/18th to wish me happy b-day. She wanted to be the first one to tell me happy birthday. But.. she got a little confused... my b-day is the 19th... Here's the conversation/

*ring*
me:Hello?
Katie: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
Me:...? Ummm.. thanks?
Katie: I wanted to be the first one to wish you a happy b-day so I called right at midnight!!
Me:...You know my birthday is the 19th....
Katie:...... Why?
Me:....
Katie:....
Me:....
Katie:.. OK bye!

So Yeah.. that was special. She gave me my b-day present today. Here it is:
Me: Hello?
Katie: HI! Have a good birthday?
Me: Yeah
Katie: Hang on a sec
Audrey: APPEEE BIFDAY! APPEEE BIFDAY!
Me: *Melt* AWWWWW!
Katie: yeah, we've been working on it so she could tell you it on your birthday.
Me: *tear*

That was cute. She also revealed to me that Audrey got her middle name from me. I don't know how true this is considering my grandma's middle name is Leigh, as well as my mother's.. all spelled the same. But, whateva.

So yeah! 9 days 22 hours 38 minutes and 42 seconds until we move!"

She was someone I talked to almost everyday, saw almost every friday night, and at all the practices.. just weird. I was also a captain when her sister joined the team, so I think about her a lot lately. We were all sisters on that team. Kelly (the girl) was one of the saberettes with me and emily. Had to be talented to be one of those, and she really was.. it's just really sad..


More dorkdom for you: I downloaded a yahoo widget that counts down the time until the move day. So everytime I look at my computer, I can see the exact time I have left here. Currently we've got 15days 0hours 44 minutes and 26 seconds. 

Oh and we gained another couch? Yeah. It's solid black so that's cool. It should look great with our royal blue and yellow couch *lol*

I've boycotted cleaning all together. I just don't do it anymore, not worth it. And guess what.. it's nasty here. Except for the things RJ's has done.

Stress stress stress. I have a lot of it right now. I don't wanna talk about it.

Rj had to call in on monday. I wasn't upset, nor did I blame him. About 2 am, dead silent in the apartment except for *crrrruucnh* followed by silence *crrrrrrrrrunch* silence. Yeah, someone bursts into the apartment at 2 am, turns on the t.v. and eats potato chips. And anyone who has been here knows that the apartment's layout allows you to hear all things at all times. (It's a very square apartment. All rooms come to a point in the hallway, almost dead on)

So my birthday is this weekend? I hardly even remembered it. Probably 'cuz I'm not doing anything. I kinda wanna do something at the new apartment. Although Mikey said he would change the name of his party this weekend from ""congrats christy"" to ""Congrats christy/Happy b-day Kenzie."" :) 

I had to work a long day today.. I have to do it again tomorrow. Things are getting really stressful there as well. I used to love it there.. loved the people and the job. But now it's just the people. Nobody can make their sales without force-feeding customers and it's just not cool. I dunno what's gonna happen.

Grrrrrg. I can't wait for this all to pass. 

Now to plan something to do for the next 15 days 0 hours 33 minutes and 40 seconds."

Yes it's crude, imperfect and missing a few items, but it's the basic idea. This is WAAAAY better than moving furniture around for days to decide what we like best. This gives us a pretty good idea of what we're going to do.

Told you I was a dork, but I'm overly excited for the new place.

Math exam today, wish me freaking luck. I'm gonna need it.

In other news, we went to mikey's the other night and of course RJ and mikey had to wrestle out their gay love. Well one of the giants stepped on my toe and sprained it. It's purple and painful and everytime I hit it on something, I feel sick. It's lovely. Strangest thing was that it was just a few close friends at Mikey's, me, RJ, Josh, and a couple others. No crazies, which made it kinda crazy. The two girls there were actually really cool and slightly hilarious. It was just strange to see mikey downing capri suns vs. jack daniels."

But it is not the incident we want to remember. We should remember her Labryinthine re-enactments in the kitchen, chasing bob the moth across the driveway, sleeping underneath a circusish tent, and pirate wenchings.

We must bear in mind that her death will not be in vain. Her tragic end will serve as a lesson to all cell phone users; never lose your phone or the wrath of the 'rents will smite you DOWN!

As you keep her in your hearts, please enjoy pickled whipped cream jerky, buttery nipples, various cheese products, pizza rolls, and bagel bites.

I got a little carried away with early packing. Hopefully RJ had no intention of reading any books for the next month because I packed both book cases worth *lol*

I took my in class final for my writing class. I had to write a 600 word reflective essay in the span of fourty minutes to include in my portfolio (Which is 70% of my grade and determines whether I pass or fail) My essay kicked ass. So kicked ass. I'm so happy. Now I just have to finish math and art. My art teacher is an idiot though...

Here's the tricky part; we're gonna have to ask to stay here one extra day, through the day June 1st, otherwise our stuff will be in the lawn until 8 am on the first. It shouldn't be a problem, when we give our 30 day notice here, we'll just say it'll be vacant by 8 pm june 1st or something.

So I took a copy of the apartment floor plan and scanned it.. printed it bigger.. then made scale paper models of our furniture and arranged them on the paper floor plan. How lame. But at least we know exactly where everything is going! Oh, I should mention that RJ helped. And did a very good job *pats*

Tomorrow is my english exam. I'm not excited. I have to be there at 10:10 or she will lock me out. She even said, ""Door will not open for you if you arrive at 10:11, don't test me on this. I haven't had a teacher this crazy since Bonita. But at least she was a fascinating relic.

You know those moments when yer bf makes you 100% melt? Had one of those yesterday. He sincerely looked me in the eyes and told me how excited he was to be getting a place with just us... awwww....

I'm not gonna lie, it's a little cozy. It's like emily's without the office/computer room thing. So it's about the large end of small. But the bathroom is heudge.

ANYONE WILLING TO COME OUT/AVAILABLE ON JUNE FIRST TO HELP US MOVE WILL BE HANDSOMELY REWARDED!!! Truth is, we have to move in less than a 24 hour period. Granted I did that once with my mom and it was an entire house, but it really wasn't fun.

We will be getting a u-haul and hilarity will ensue.

I'm not having a party for my b-day because, well.. I'm not having one in this hell-hole. I'd like to have a party though, maybe I'll post-pone my b-day until july 19? Bleh, whatever. We'll see.

I'm just really excited to get out of here I guess. There are so many things I look forward to.

I also can't wait for summer break. Then fall when RJ starts his first semester at college! *takes a bow*  I'm really proud of him.

I found an e-mail from my mom that's like 3 days old and it says

""Kate is having some medical issues.....possible heart murmur.  She goes to the doc tomorrow.  Hopefully, we'll know more this week. 

Things are going good....hope your Easter went well. 

Miss ya....love ya. 

Mom""

Umm... what? Your daughter possibly has a heart murmur and you say things are good? And this e-mail is 3 days old? You couldn't call me? You haven't given me an update, or anything since then.

This sounds awful, but I don't know how seriously I should take this. I mean remember that she called me out of the blue and told me she was internally bleeding and was going to die in a few days.. and that was an extreme exaggeration. So part of me can't help but think she's doing the same thing again for attention.

Katie would have called me.


So since I'm trying not to worry about that.. We applied for an apartment last night.

It's windemere village off of saginaw, it's a one bedroom on the third floor (NO more basement style apartment thank you!) and has a balcony (finally!) and allows cats (but we DON'T HAVE CATS- GOT IT?!?!)

Get this, it's $460 a month but if we sign a lease this month, it's $100 off rent for SIX MONTHS! that's $360 a month.. $10 freakin dollars more than we're paying now! Effin amazing. 

I just hope we get it. The only thing I'm worried about is that all the fees that Loren racked up are gonna somehow get linked to RJ and I and we'll get a bad report because of it. We told the person that we applied with what was going on and she seemed to understand, so I hope that doesn't happen. I'll be pissed. We find out either after 4:30 today, or on monday.

I got a really nice complement from a customer the other day. She said, ""You look like my soon to be sister in law... She's gorgeous."" I wanted to glomp her for making my shitty day better.

Oh yeah.. It was so hard to get this. I drew the horns and stuff on the t.v. and waited for him to move into the picture. I didn't evenknow it looked like he was growling until I looked at the picture I took. Too fuggin' perfect.

Tonight is the say anything show. RJ's really excited for it. I'm excited for him. I think he may be their biggest fan.

Format show was ok. I didn't like the venue (MSU union)or any of the opening bands. Anathallo was cool to watch, but that's the kind of band they are... one you've gotta watch.. kind of like stomp. Plus I just wanted to punh the lead singer directly in the face. he just had one of those faces. AH and theses two girls in front of me were pissin me off! They had to have been high, or on ecstasy. No joke. They were bouncing around like idiots... to slow songs. So after they bumped into me a second time I went, ""Yeah, move."" and stood in front of them. At 5'8"" I was much taller than them (they had to be 4' something) and they eventually moved. My bitchy side has it's perks.

Plus I was kinda cranky from my diet. Speaking of..

I'm leaving phase one 2 days early. It has made me extremely cranky, depressed, and frustrated. Not to mention that I feel tired all the time from the complete lack of any carbs or sugar. So here's a big ""fuck you"" to phase 1 _|_

OK so I can't really eat a LOT more sugars and carbs on phase two, but at least I can have whole wheat things now. I cheated last night at the restaurant and had wheat toast before I officially switched to phase 2. I don't have a scale, so I couldn't tell you if I've lost anything. I'd like to think that i have, but I only really notice that I 've lost a little in my stomach, maybe. But that's apparently where you're supposed to lose it first... I wasn't even concerned about my belly, but hey, it didn't hurt.. much.

Oh. Emily. bad news. I have to work the 19th at noon. I'm really pissed. Can the other person make it still? I know you need both of us though.

Six minutes till I have to leave. I should probably brush my teeth.. and pack my jeans. RJ is picking me up at work and we're going directly to the show, so I have to pack another set of clothes, shoes, my makeup, and hair stuff. Oh vanity."

"event","So concert tonight? I've kind of forgotten about it until a couple days ago. I haven't seen the format in a while, so that'll be nice.

I have to work today. What kind of bullshit is that, huh? Here it is coming up on exam time and my schedule starts getting messed up. I can't stand my hours. Love the job. Not the hours.. or the pay for that matter.
To make it worse, RJ has monday's off now... we usually hang out and play video games all day. *insert bummed face*

Stephanie. You ROCK my makeup collection. Sorry I haven't had a chance to say thanks, I feel like a jerk for that. But you rock! Even the hoochie mamma lipsticks are cool.

So yeah.  I've sectioned up my livejournal into like 6 groups now. So if it looks like I haven't posted in a while, it's because I've posted to a group you're not a part of. Sorry. It's just obvious that it has to be this way.

I'm building a pirate ship? RJ and I bought this model kit for one like a million months ago and I found it again when I was  cleaning... again. It's probably one of the most frustrating things I've ever worked on. The instructions are for the boat ""Jolly Roger"" and on of the pieces for the ship label says something like ""Flying Whitefish."" I'm just assuming that some boats in the series have a sheet of parts in common so they send both name plates with it.... At least I HOPE.... I'll be sure to post a picture of the results.

Like the new icon? It's the only one I can find of him in his apron. I can't even find just a picture of him in the apron.. so I had to settle for an icon :( 

We own V for Vendetta now.. *ahem* I mean uhhh... no we don't....

We only have to pay rent at this place one more time... Then we move again. Man does this remind of my childhood or what *lol* We've got a couple of places in mind. We've even considered a larger studio apartment so we can save a few extra bucks. It's not like anyone comes over, so we don't really need the privacy. I mean, I pee in front of RJ for god's sakes.

I'm going to kill myself if I don't go to phase 2 of the diet soon."

I now have to actually sit and DECIDE whom I trust enough to read certain topics from my journal. How pathetic. I can't have a general friends list because people take everything I say literally.

This isn't high school. Talk to me and not behind my back. Chip Kiebler already does enough of that for everyone. I don't need people whom I am supposed to trust, doing the same.

I miss my friends. Who understand me and don't make assumptions..just by the way. Don't assume anything about me or my opinions unless I out and say it.

If anyone is going to give anyone shit about my posts, it should be to me and not to someone else ABOUT me.

I've been doin this south beach thing for a couple of days now. I don't know how much longer I can do phase 1. It's seriously the worst thing I've ever done to myself. I feel sick, I feel tired, and I'm upset that I can't eat a lot of the things I used to. If I don't start feeling better soon, I'm going to move on to phase 2. Emily had to do this as well, so I know I'm not crazy.

I also have zero motivation right now. I really need school to be over. I also need a better paying job. I should have asked for more when I got hired. I love my job to death, but I just feel like something has to change.

Lemonade sounds sooooo good right now. Actually, we have a sugar free mix that tastes like regular... I'm gonna make that.. now I just need room for the pitcher in the fridge. *sigh*

Went and saw V for Vendetta again. It's one of the best movies I have ever seen. Fills my NEB cup to overflowing with how perfect V is.

I feel like I haven't done anything but be a homebody for the last couple of weeks.. To make it worse, I'm going to my MOTHER'S this saturday and potentially spending the night. How. Lame. It's only saved by the fact that Audrie and Bobby will be there. I'm so proud of my brother.. he's turned into one of the coolest, funniest guys I know.. I'd liket to say I played at least a small part in his awesome sense of humor, but it's really all my dad's fault that Bobby and I are freaks of nature with our weird humor. 

Anyways. RJ and I are going out to GR early for a little vacation/date. We're gonna go see the butterflies, and the museum because RJ has never actually been in grand rapids. Well. He's never been out of the car. 

There's a techno and tacos this weekend. This is the only bar in existance that neglects the ID checking step (name omitted for awesomeness). Looks like Kenzie's getting hammered again on $1.50 margaritas. I just realized all the bar hopping I'm doing on friday.. First is Relli's with RJ's family, then it's techno and tacos at the other. Man. I'm just a crazy party animal.

So I had training yesterday again for work. My boss went with me. No pressure. He took me to lunch at Finley's and we talked about the general bullshit: today's news, school, RJ, work, etc. It was just weird. I remember being a kid and seeing people in business suits walking into a restaurant and having lunch.. I used to think that they must be important and rich.. Then as a I sat there eating my low-fat salad in my button sport coat and shiny shoes, I realized that I was that person I saw when I was little. I was that prissy business chick with the salad and diet soda. The only difference- I knew how unimportant my career was to me. I knew how unhappy I was dressed up like career barbie and how much I looked forward to going home and putting on fat pants. 

It was just so.... eerie.... and.. borderline upsetting. I don't wanna be suit.. I wanna be a bartender *lol*

I also wanna be 8 pounds lighter. I got the south beach book in the mail. Should be starting late this week.

Damn.... I still have 10 minutes."

"event","So yeah.. I had a bad day yesterday... I came in that day to make up for missing a day when the car wouldn't start, then I couldn't get my chagne vault open at work (I swore up and down that the combination was my birthday-it wasn't) and wasted everyone's time, then I spilled water all over my window, then RJ called to tell me we were out of bread and needed it for dinner, then I ripped a pair of my work pants, put on my favorite sweater and found a hole in it, got into an argument with RJ (which was stupid), and just over-all wanted to curl up into a ball and hide.

Today was better though.

So I've suddenly gotten a fascination with mixed media art and I've started doing some of my own. I really puts crappy pictures to good use. I'd scan some to the journal but it's out of commission at the moment. 

Audrie saw a picture of me at my mom's and she pointed at it and said ""PeePoo."" The whole weekend she was here I'd ask her ""where's poopie"" and she'd look  for RJ, point at him and say ""peepoo"" so I think she was looking at my picture and asking ""where's peepoo"" I get to see her next weekend. I'm so excited. I guess she won't take off the shoes we bought her. It just feels good to know that she remembers me and all that jazz.

Slowly filtering out the groceries to start up the south beach diet with Emily. I'm still scared. I don't think I can live without fruit juice. But 8 lbs. would put me at the bottom of my healthy weight range, and that would ROCK!

Things have begun to grow on my kitchen table. That is, the seeds I planted are growing! I'll soon be enjoying my ""fragrant flower assortment""

Know what? I can't stand scenesters. That is all. I'll probably be leaving myspace because of it. The idea of collecting people bothers me as well as 34057308457 other aspects of myspace and the people on it.

"event","So, I don't know what came over me, but I did a spontaneous cleaning. Not just your average ""pick things up"" cleaning... but like... mop to the walls cleaning. I seriously mopped the walls, the floor, wiped down the counters... just really cleaned. Did I have help? Nope. Just a little clearing of the way when I vaccumed. That's fine, so long as it stays clean. I am also not cleaning up after anyone else. Which is probably why there is already stuff on the kitchen table that should be thrown away. It's so frustrating.

So in the midst of all this, I get upset again that there isn't a plant in this place. I need a plant. So RJ and I return some bottles and start plant shopping. We figure, ok, we don't wanna spend a lot so we'll plant one (I have a ceramic lamp thing that's shaped like a bowl, the lamp broke but the bowl part is just too cool so I sealed up the hole) in a bowl and it'll eventually be pretty. Then, there it was.. this huge chinese fan palm tree. RJ's like, ""Yeah..pfft.. I wonder how much that is"" I assumed like $35 bucks like all the other big plants at meijer. It was 17.99. RJ almost pooped on the floor in the plant section. So we bought this beast and wedged it in the car after taking it through high winds and put it in the apartment. It is the coolest.

I even put it up on the RPG board I'm at for a naming contest. Wow.

We also bought some seeds and they are growing on the kitchen table as we speak!

We're so ready for our own apartment now. We've got everything we need! We should be moving around may!

So I'm starting the south beach diet with Emily. I'm scared. It says to cut fruit juice and that's seriously all I drink. I ordered the book to get some specifics.. maybe it's just fruit juice with high sugar or something. I wanna lose about 10 pounds, but if I do that, that puts me 2 pounds under the healthy weight range for my height. I'm actually like smack dab in the middle of the range for my height, but I'd like to be on the low end. Like, the minimum end. So 8 pounds it is!

RJ is doing it too. He just doesn't know it yet.

**EDIT** I just went out to start my car for work..and nothing.. the dome lights were left on somehow... fucking hell... I bet sherri's getting really mad at me because I can't go a month without something happening and needing to call in. Just my luck. *picks up phone to call Sherri* Gah, she didn't sound happy.. I offered to come in tomorrow to make it up and she said that was fine..but still didn't sound satisfied. I think I'll just go cry now."

"event","So this is my 694th post on this blog. It started when I was 13 years old and had no idea what I was doing. I've hidden my posts but they still exist so I can laugh at myself forever but they are not public anymore. I have decided that it's the end of this era. This eight years of growing up and ranting and whinging has come to a close and I have started a new blog elsewhere. If you know me and you read this, you may ask me where it is. I'm sure the link will be put somewhere on one of my social network sites but I haven't decided yet. That blog will just be a continuation of this journey I'm on but a fresh start. A new domain and a new look. So that's it. This is the end of an era. I didn't quite get to 700 posts but close enough. I wonder if anyone had ever read them all. Now you will not have the option. Only I will be able to laugh at the immaturity and naiveity  of my teenage years and a little beyond. So. Peace out. Til the next blog.

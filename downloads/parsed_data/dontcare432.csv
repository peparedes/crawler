"event","last night was interesting. im such a child i truly am. but whenever i want to say something i cant. its the whole stupid thing when u open ur mouth and nothing co mes out. i dont know why. it isnt a big deal i guess. i dont know why this time is so different. probably cuz  theres three possnile outcomes apposed to the normal two. and i like the normal two, its plan and simple but the third..that stupid third is what was i think, was stopping me. oh what a fool i am. but it doesnt matter, nothign will come from this. excpet maybe the third. the third seems presestent, and goes after what they want, which isnt a bad thing, unless ur me. but i should be used to this shouldnt i? it alawys happens, no matter what its so pathedic. there will alawys be a third and theres nothing i can do about that excpet sit back and watch, im not like the third and never will be. thats just how it is."

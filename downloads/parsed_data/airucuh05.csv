It is not a bad relationship...it could be worse...i think that i need to just chill...yes he will be leaving tomorrow to south texas (which I am going to miss him a lot) but i need to have some fun with my friends and not mope around just cause he's not going to be by my side...i will still feel his love...i know that he will think about me...and i know that he is going to miss me...welp...until tomorrow we'll see how it goes after lunch...hopefully he won't make me mad today, or you know what?

"event","Well I just am going to jump into this thing they call ""live journal"".

I am so confused, I don't know what to feel... If I do this, long time consequences could occur, that's what he told me ""i meant everything I said""... well that meant that we are in for a long life together, I care for the both of them I really do...Love...I love him....which one you ask?  THE ONE AND ONLY...the one that has been in my life for about a year and a half...this is what it feels like...i don't want to lose what i have with him or the other guy, i care immensely about the both of them...i really do...why do we have to banned from each other...it's so childish...he's the other best friend (C.C)...you are...please don't be mad...I just don't want to lose ""the other best friend"", he means alot to me C.C., when we were talking about it last nite, I was referred to ""his brown eyed doll""... i really wish he could hear that song C.C.

""your'e his brown eyed doll, at least that's what he told you, his words make you feel small, you're his brown eyed doll, at least that's what he told you, he lifts you up to fall...""  

""his brown eyed doll is blue...."""

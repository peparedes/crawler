"event","Some people I come across, or who have met me, often get the impression that I have a side to myself that is merciless, extreme or overly idealist. I think a lot. I'm actually a lot more open-minded than some people may think and I try to re-examine my view from as high a bird's eye as I can manage to make sure I am seeing things clearly. 
I rarely see in black and white, although my vision of civilization is a clear one. There are those for which other living things are secondary to their existence. It is not a very difficult thing to show consideration for others. Although an alarmingly large number of individuals in society seem incapable of this humane task. 
All of us hurt someone on occasion and it is not a pleasant thing. Often you lose touch with an old friend, who really misses you and wonders why you don't call anymore. Or maybe you made fun of a song or film that was one of the most meaningful parts of someone's memory, right in front of them. However there is a line that a rational and well-grounded person can be called upon to draw. Some people have lost touch with other's ability to feel pain and serve no purpose to our society. Those rational and well-minded people are what the world of tomorrow needs. 
There are also those who are so wrapped up in their indoctrinated idea of freedom and liberty that they refuse submission before any entity, be it in the form for a woman, man, government, idea or just a feeling. If you serve nothing, you are a mere consumer. There are forces stronger than you, wiser than you, more graceful and unfathomable. 
To see oneself reflected in another's eyes is a vision into a future of radiance, strength and propinquity.

"event","I wrote about this dream in an email, and wanted to paste it here so I can remember it later :

I had to fill up my car with gas and there was this place where diesel was like 1.02 and I thought, wow I gotta get as much as my tank will let me. But I kept having to do different things with it because I couldn't just pour it in. I had to open the passanger side door and pour it in  slot in the apolstery. I kept spilling too and it was going everywhere. and pretty soon the ground was soaked and so were my clothes.  ""I thought god if there was one match spark I could lose my life."" Then  a glow started to emerge from the nozzle of the gas dispenser. I just thought ""oh no."" and the glow turned into a flame. and it started to get about as big as two candle flames and a tear started to come out of my eyes as I was just getting really panicky and preparing for holocaust. But the fuel never lit on fire and the flame sort of just started to die on its own."

"event","Last night was about one of the best damn times I've ever had. Definitely the best christmas party ever. It was at such a fucking awesome club: <a href=""http://www.thehighlandsla.com"">The Highlands</a> . The company I work for treated everyone to an amazing night. I had this delicious teriyaki salmon, prime rib, a reallllly good salad and a like 3 vodka martinis, a tequila shot, most of Juni's lemondrop and champagne, and a new castle at some point. It was so damn funny...we all had so many funny exchanges and for a while it was me, my boss and Juni(who hear so much about each other it was a real treat to have them meet.) Then random people would find us and I just remember laughing so much. Me and my boss have very similar senses of humor, he's so fucking hilarious. A few things in particular I just fucking died. It makes me feel really lucky to have fallen in with such cool people. From the beginning,  right as I walked in the door like 10 minutes later my cheeks were all already starting to hurt from smiling and laughing so much. 

Man ever since I started working here, I've been so happy. When you have a good work environment and really fun and positive coworkers, things are so much easier. I think I had mixed negativity working for Kaplan and the University so its really nice to actually be working for a place with such a nice and wonderful atmosphere. Juni had commented on how everybody seemed really warm and friendly and thats exactly how things really have been. 

Dancing is so much fun. I really wish I could do it more often, it also always makes me think of my friend Josh who I really miss, he always would talk about how much he liked dancing and never got to do it. I really can't wait to see him again. 
Dancing is also a bizarre and very human thing to do. Its weird, no other animals are really observed dancing for no reason than like mating dances and stuff. I suppose certain primates dance and I've heard about dogs reacting to music too. Very interesting."

Sorry, Kymm I didn't think it was a very good quiz. But I really love dogs a lot so it's definitely got something magical happening. 

I've figured out why people hate LA. It's called Hollywood. I work there and I hate it. I'm not talking about the ""it's so cool and progressive to hate LA""-crowd ... I honestly haven't met too many people that talk about rolling through this particular part anyway. It's kind of the worst of all worlds: you have plenty of low-class deliquent ass kids, shit-punks, hookers of every disgusting type and of course some random fuck yelling about jesus. Add to that a lot of weird looking people who drive expensive cars and kids in other expensive cars who look like they might be friends with ozzy osbourne's kids and that's about the worst aspects of Hollywood. It's not all bad though and there are much worse places to work, but I definitely get the ""learn to swim"" message here. I still love where I live and LA as a whole. There are a lot of Eurasian people and businesses in random pockets of hollywood though, and that makes me feel a little more at home. 

Working for a large corporation has sort of changed my views on large corporations and big-money capitialism. It's kind of disgusting. I'm pretty nondiscrete about my journal and my email so I don't really want to go on about what bothers me about it here. It sort of resparks my interest back in my right-wing socialism days. But I honestly am growing really tired of political meandering. I don't really choose to be involved mentally in the things I am, I suppose I just feel strongly about certain things. I do feel like its a battle-front though not really the end-all that you fight for. The more I dwell in that area ""behind the front"" the more I understand that that's what really matters, and where I need to be spending more of my time."

"event","Last night was the best, despite the fact that I had to leave LA at 4:30pm on the day before thanksgiving, meaning a LOT of traffic. My paternal cousin was having a birthday at my aunt's house which is a really gorgeous house. Its located in the countryside near the foothills of northeast Fresno and at nighttime, when there is moonlight out the whole landscape is toned with this divine blue light. I actually made it there around quarter till ten, which was great because dinner wasn't going to be served for another half hour. My aunt's husband greeted me at the driveway, which I thought was a very warm welcome. He likes me very much, especially since the last few times I saw him we have had really great conversations and I think he appreciates my outlook and character. The feeling is actually mutual so its really good. We did some tequila shots and I had a few brandy's which, funny enough, I told Cyrus that I got really into brandy recently and I always think of him cause it was his drink. So then we had this really long conversation about the history of brandy and how it was ""actually everybody's drink back then.."" and he pulled out this really elite French Brandy, Rayel I think it was called..it was realllly good. 
My father's sister and my mother's youngest sister easily have the reputation for being the best cooks in the family. My aunt really outdid herself. Cyrus was telling me that she spent a lot of the previous night and morning preparing everything and man did it show... First there was goose fesenjun(which is a walnut based sauce), then lamb shanks with dill rice, these huge and unbelievable meatballs, an amazing salad, and a seperate platter of cherry-plum rice. The appetizers were crazy-good too. 
I really love their damn house too. Its really big and very classy. I hadn't been there in a long time and there was all these decorative thigns that I hadn't seen before including a very cute baby grand piano. My father actually designed the house himself which makes it all the more meaningful for me. 
I feel a lot more at ease with my father's family these days. I used to feel more comfortable with my mother's, but things have really changed. Recently, I see a lot of things in my maternal family that make me, and have made me a little apprehensive. My paternal family just lives better, gets along better and has really good taste. I get this stressful feeling around my mother's family a lot and ask myself a lot of questions like ""why the hell does so and so insist on living/thinking that way"". I just feel like I can at least relax with my father's family. 
<hr>
Recently things that I'm seeing and hearing are really pissing me off and pushing me to write more for the political party I'm affiliated with. Several recurring elements that I'm constantly exposed to are closley related to my political and social feelings. Instead of moving away and letting down my guard I feel even stronger on the defensive and the ciricling seems to lead me back to the same conclusion. I'm a little worried, if things happen for the worse, which they very likely may, I'm going to be put in a really uncomfortable position without immediate allies. I woke up this morning thinking about this and then I thought about my own personal life and realized that I'm very happy. Things have gone so well in many respects and I couldn't really ask for more in my own sphere. 
The contrast is a difficult view to take in sometimes."

I think it'd be nice to do payroll or something for Vivid.

I've added some items to my DVD wish list: I want to get some Good Times and Happy Days. Happy Days because of the 2 year Arthur Fonzarelli affection that Sean has sparked in me and Good Times cause I really liked it when JJ would say DY-NO-Miiiiite! --- Although I remember there would often be these akward silent moments on Good Times when something politically charged or  dramatic happened. It was a pretty smart show. Back when there was still drama and good humour on television.

"event","What a week this will turn out to be. Two back to back 11 hour work-days and then one long ugly drive to Fresno during the holiday rush. Oh well. I'm really thankful to have this car down here, I think without it traffic would drive me crazy. Its so relaxing to drive it and just listen to good music and occasionally puff on a cigar, which makes the time roll by. Thankfully I can stop teaching for Kaplan after the 1st and start putting in a normal 40 hour week. I'm really sick of that company for several reasons, mostly because they are so cheap and so fucking wealthy. There are definitely things about it that make me happy but for the most part I'm a little tired of it. 

I've decided that in December I want to invest in some good DVD's. I think I rely on the internet too much for good film,etc. and its nice to have full quality, fast and easily accessible discs on hand. I found an incredible Andrew Blake boxset that I plan on buying along with a few other of his titles. I swear that man and his work is so inspiring and awe-evoking. In some ways it almost makes ashamed that I'm not involved in making that caliber of work but its at least something to aspire to. 

I started working on a project doing avant-garde/experimental interpretations of some select Nina Simone songs and I am very excited about it. Working with an amazing vocalist really changes my mindset too. In fact anytime I've worked with an instrumentalist that I've thought to be exceptionally good its added that extra level of ""wow we really have to harness this and show it off""-type motivation. But also it's just kind of an extra reminder of what you have available to you to make a really great piece."

I'm not productive enough. This is the reason that starting sunday/monday I'm going to experiment with being conscious from around 2 or 3am to 7 or 8pm. This will mean that I will go to bed when I come home from work and wake up very early in the morning. I have a feeling this experiment will be a shortlived one since my social life will surely suffer...however I am noticeably more productive, sharp and creative in the first 4 hours of my day, so instead of wasting them on my job, I thought I might make the late night hours work.

I'm extremely excited to have fixed my car. I found a new grill and new light fixtures off a 450SE in suprisingly good condition. It looks like nothing happened at all. Although the hood stil has two dents that cause about an inch clearance where it should be flush. It will have to do for now. I really want a steam cleaner now. Its extremely satisfying to be able to take the car back to its old shape. 
I had dinner with my parents in fresno last week and it was wonderful. My dad brought out a 2000 wine that was very very good and I made my italian-style fish with some very premium halibut my mom wanted to use. Man was it good and definitely quality. All that was missing was my sister and her dumb jokes. I'm just kidding her jokes are very funny. 
I also watched the Godfather part II the other day while sharing another bottle of wine. Absolute serenity. A night to truly remember.

One time I was playing my guitar around someone and they remarked that what I was playing sounded overly aggressive. I sort of laughed and told them that was really not aggressive at all, and played something that would be considered aggressive by most... he only scoffed his naive music-major scoff and said, ""hah, no, thats melodramatic..."" 
Thankfully, I am no longer in contact with this individual. 

Playing a good round of black metal on the much neglected guitar after a week of inconvenience and 3D modeling feels incredible. Especially in my cold room with huge windows over looking lit up hillsides. Very pretty at night, makes me glad I don't have curtains. Its too bad more people don't understand/appreciate this art. I guess it appeals to a certain perspective. It doesn't really matter in the end I guess. Its a really nice way to start a Friday night nonetheless. The perfect prelude to see a friend of a friend's concious hip-hop band.(sarcasm). It will be assuredly fun nonetheless.

The American presidential election is my latest element to fuel my hatred for democracy. An idiot can be president of the most powerful nation of the world for eight years it seems. In the 21st Century... it seems unthinkable. We are doing amazing things with genetics, stem cell research --- the fact that was even an issue was absurd --- art and music are drawing lines never thought imaginable -- yet a command of the english language seems not to be a prerequisite for presidency.  I hope all of this will make people understand who their real enemies are.

I've been engaged in a lot of stuff that I need to be doing. Some of it for my protracted investment of the future. Its a little overwhelming. There's so much going on and I suppose I have a lot to learn. I know I do. I'm sort of enjoying the process I guess. 
I've been drinking a lot of coffee(2-3 small cups a day, thats a lot for me I guess) and also working out a lot. I don't know what it is. I go through these crazed gym things every now and again.

I have to say, I'm kind of in a bad spot. I definitely don't feel like I wield enough power sometimes and have enough control over where my life is going. Although there is no lack of happiness in my life, in fact there is a remarkable amount as of late. Everything is ""okay"" and where it should be though. There really are things that could be more to my advantage. I'm just a little impatient. Having enemies is really bad, especially when they are in your way...

So the whole story with the police-sniper rifle and all the bloodhunger that ensued after a few days ago had to do with an individual who's duties include evaluating instructors at a company I work for. I used to be a classical musician and was regularly in front of juries and individuals criticizing what I held most dear all the time. And I respected it, because they were smart and would say constructive, although occasionally stinging comments. I understood their perspective and wasn't so sensitive about it...
I can only say ...that this....rat bastard, asshole... resembled none of that. I've been evaluated by 4 people before him with no problem, but this was the stupidest bunch of shit I have ever had to listen to in my life, extremely well disguised in sheeps clothing. But I saw right through it. Additionally I feel like this guy has had issues with me since I started there that I can attribute to maybe one thing or another... either way he is no one to me and has effectively made me number my days at this company by personal choice.  
I don't know what to attribute it to, because there is nothing characteristic about this person that I specifically can attribute my hatred towards, meaning he doesn't resemble anything that I am known to dislike in a person. But I will say that I don't remember hating someone so intensely in my life. The dehumanization process occured very rapidly and I'm eager to burn this bridge as soon as possible and get myself the fuck away from this motherfucker.

Not being able to write music for a living really pisses me off sometimes. It's totally what I do best and what I feel most committed toward. Whatever. Rules of the game I guess. 
Maybe one day i'll just buy 1.6 million dollars in barabonds, hire someone to steal them, collect 100% from the insurance and buy back the bonds from the theifs at 60 cents on the dollar. Then I can do whatever I want all day.

So, when I accelerate (I have rear wheel drive) the wheel off the ground spins in the air pointlessly, while the planted wheel doesn't do a fucking thing. And there you are. Stuck at the base of a huge fucking driveway, on a huge fucking hill, with your car in a pathetic display of submission. 
Luckily one of my neighbors is very fat. (Boy if I had a dime for everytime I said that!) This guy was nice enough to plant himself in my back seat while his friend pushed down on my car forcing it to make contact and subsequent rubber burning, etc. etc. and finally making its departure for the absolute LAST time off my sonofabitch dumb driveway. 

Speaking of impact, maybe when I'm more calm in a few days I'll elaborate on one of the hardest-to-resist invitations to homicide that I recieved yesterday, after having a conversation with this...motherfucker."

I spent a lot of time in the downtown Glendale area today, waiting for my car to be serviced (which is fixed finally.) I am extremely happy at this.
Glendale has a very large Armenian population, much to my delight. As I knew before, Armenians are very classy people and I really love them. It's really nice seeing such nice taste for a change after living in Northern California for so long. Of course there are exceptions to every rule, and <b>David Krikorian</b> is the exception here, who has proven himself unworthy of understanding high art -- namely high art involving Al Pacino and Robert Deniro.

Okay let's continue with this wells fargo mess now that I am on a rare posting spree.

My sister had been making fun of me a lot because this Personal Banking thing i'm trying to do requires a lot of preliminary testing including math, etc. So she would tease me about my MaTh QuIZ and what not. Just so you know this Personal Banking thing is basically one-on-one consultation with people who's money you ...finance, or whatever. Apparently they're going to teach me how to deal with money which is good. Anyway the job is nutty - oh excuse the CAREER which they insist on calling it, and I guess for good reason. You take a (REALLY HARD) test in October, a follow-up assessment interview in November and you get your decision in January and start paid training in February. Apparently its highly selective. They have like a 20 percent pass rate on the test and they eventually take 50 of the 2000 that apply. 

So, as you may know, I teach the LSAT and have been dealing it with for quite some time now so I've been exposed to a lot of formal logic and argumentation, so I was like yeah-hard-test-whatever(the proctor played the test up to be really hard). I will say that the bank's exam was very very difficult and honestly, I thought I was in the 80th percent of failure.  The math part was fucking nuts, no calculators and all this shit about dividends and percentages and comparisons of profits by percentage and stocks and shares and money blahblahblah money .  Well good news is I passed the sumabitch, so we'll see where we go with this. 

Lets fast forward a few days. I got my fucking car and was all excited. Yes! The Radiator is fixed..whoa...
what
the hell
happened to my steering....
Imagine driving in the swiss alps on a snowy evening without chains with large amounts of scotch in your bloodstream. Thats about what it feels like to drive the car. The wheel just goes right...then left... then you feel liek you're going to die. etc. etc. etc.

SO I don't even know anymore. The motherfuckers that towed it are coming out here to see if it was their botch, since it was fine pre-tow and the mechanic(a friend of the family) said it was like that when it got there. 
Well this is complete bullshit. As I was telling my sister, the heart break from seeing this machine from its 1915 ceremonial parade status, to late 1944 Warsaw wreckage is hard to take in.  
Mayhem wasn't the best soundtrack for the last couple of days. But I've been feeling so much serenity and beautiful moments in the last several weeks, that I felt like intensifying the discomfort level just a kick more. And in hindsight I could still appreciate the stress-level. It just sort makes things heavier to deal with...this is the kind of problem that follows you around. 
Primus is helping my attitude about it...perfect mix of darkness and smiles."

This morning before I had to try and figure out what my mechanic did to my car to render the steering all but useless, I decided to have my tasty Flax Seed Granola. I was out of milk, so I decided to be sneaky and take a little bit out of the gallon one of my housemates had. ""You are so sly"" I thought to myself...then I ate the first spoonful and froze. I walked back to the fridge, looked on the other side of the container and it said ""Sell by Sept. 11."" That was about six weeks ago, and I just ate some of it. Boy I'll tell ya....when I ate that shit, it felt like a plane crashed right into my mouth.

Yesterday I went to the financial/corporate district here and it was really amazing. Huge tempered glass and granite buildings, very clean weirdly tiled courtyards with lots of fountains. It was like being in a space colony. On the 43rd floor of the building I had my meeting in, I decided to take a step outside during the break to see if I could get some cell phone reception. The Wells Fargo(the building I was in) and the KPMG building(which made me think of my long last pal and local charlaton, Sean Francis) are the arguably the tallest buildings in downtown. Somehow I ended up in the stairwell and the door locks shut. So I think to myself, self... you sonofabitch....now you have to run down FOURTY THREE flights of stairs in about 8 minutes before the ""Break"" is up, run outside the building and go through security all over again. The best part is that I was on the second day of soreness from heavy lifting at the gym on my legs and I felt like I had been shot ten times with an M-16 in my thighs. 
Basically there's nothing else I need to say, it doesn't get funnier than that...I was laughing so hard going down the stairs I thought for sure I was going to fall, the only thing that could have made things funnier. I was also getting a little hypnotized by the sight of passing stairs over and over again. More things happened that were of moderate interest that I'll explain shortly."

Being on good-terms with someone and being visibly amiable can be very akward when you are aware that they are tormenting someone you love. I've met a lot of people who are incapable of this and declare their enmity forthright. Personally, the Godfather was one of my favorite movies -- keeping your enemies close is always to your advantage. You don't lie to people you care about. Period. These are words that I have lived by, so decieving the outsider is perfectly acceptable. The juxtaposition of the handshakes and inner rage are always striking and again, sometimes very uncomfortable. Inside though, there is always a need for truth and resolution, its hard to handle sometimes knowing you have to be ready to fill the graves when the flags have risen. On nights like this, it's nice to have the windows open with a cold beer. It keeps part of my mind on the battle and the forever War.

After being stranded in West LA for the last few days it's nice to be back to my place. I love how this huge house, no matter how many people are home, always feels somewhat empty. I can't really be away from my music for very long. I start to feel uncentered. I carry a lot of it in my head though and its very vivid. Last night I was actually listening to other music but my focus was so strong that I could all but hear the parallel stream in my head. There is something viscerally satisfying that seems hard to replace. 

After three-four weeks of low intensity bullshit exercise, I signed up with LA Fitness which is a great gym down here, way bigger and with more amenities than I have ever seen. They have some really great machines too that give you the best of both worlds in free weight mobility with muscle targetting. The guy who was showing my around was named Frank and had a strong German accent. He asked my background while we were at his desk in their office area and I told him I was Persian. He pointed out a few of his coworkers who were also Persian and said ""There are many Persians here, and one thing I'm suprised by, is that every Persian I meet speaks German"", I smiled and replied ""Das Starke sucht das starke."" His eyes got a little big not expecting that and gave a friendly laugh. I can't wait to get back to improving through destroying my body. My goal is to add ten pounds of muscle by the spring equinox. 
It's been far to long without my guitar so that'll be it for the night here."

A significant misfortune actually came my way since my move down here about two days ago. I will not divulge the details since I am still a little shocked/hurt to say the least still. I will say that it has to do with my Panzer. -- [ meaning of course, in reference to my Mercedes ] -- Now it is in the hands of a familial ally to whom I am sincerely indebted a great deal of gratitude. By tomorrow or saturday the intial stages of recovery will hopefully be complete and I will be on the road to returning the machine to its fully operational war status. As a token of my appreciation for the machine, I'm going to get it steam cleaned, re-grilled with some Germanic ornaments finally and maybe put up the decal designs I've wanted when I get around to it. Quite honestly, I'm a little fearful for the complete resurrection. Its not too bad honestly, again, just a <i>little</i> fearful. 

Quite a bit of brandy, scotch, coffee and hooka tobacco have gone through my body in the last 36 hours and I intend seriously pushing my body tomorrow to compensate. While I've been getting quite a bit of physical activity it still feels weird to not have that feeling of pushing the envelope with my body for more than a few days. 

Aside for the automobile assault things have been extremely well. Next week I have some stuff planned that should put the final steps in facilitating my grounding here in terms of work, etc. I feel like I have had a lot of good fortune since my move so I'm much more happy than anything and trying not spend energy on the negative occurences, as they significantly underweigh the seratonin excretion taken and taking place.
I'm also very happy to have such a loving and supporting aunt, and despite their difficulties with him, her husband and of course my youngest cousin. I find myself speaking of my aunt with regularity socially. Family really is invaluable.

Nineteen times. On his knees.
...If you've ever wondered why I support the police force, there's a partial answer. 

After a pleasantly bloody and painful trip to the dentist, who happens to be my father's cousin and a very sweet woman, I proceeded to come home and do the only logical thing someone like me could do at 9:30am on a frightfully rainy day: Pour myself a few brandies, eat my mother's superb Persian cuisine and listen to Arcturus' Sham Mirrors. Divine.
I enjoy these quiet times at my parent's home alone, even though these walls don't always contain the finest of memories. In fact last night, I had quite a violent dream where I was literally destroying everything in front of me out of rage for a family member. Suprisingly that is very much not-my-style. I think that kind of violence is so lowly and unattractive. I was so angry in my dream though I remember punching my pillow in reality. 
I must say I've been having quite a great few weeks but my dreams have been very weird. Some of them have been very enjoyable though. 

On a political note I'm so disgusted with all these tax-evading measures on the ballots. The Republican party has no shame. Everything I'm reading about only makes my dreams of an all encompassing-government more attractive. When I heard ""inefficient beauracracy"" on one of the commercials the other day my blood pressure skyrockted. Thats one of those stupid catch phrases that people just throw around like ""Fascist"" and have no idea what the hell they are even saying. 
That old story played out over and over : If you don't get it now, you probably won't ever understand.

It's been cloudy/raining the last 2 days and made the weather very enjoyable. I'm fortunate to actually have it be somewhat cooler in my area in the hotter days that I experienced in early October. 
This morning I had a wonderful breakfast of 2 grilled bratwursts with sauerkraut, baby green salad with greek dressing and 3 pieces of trader joes multigrain brown toast. Very soon coffee must be made and suit must be ironed for a prospective business I might be working with. I apparently have a few options now, but again I would like to see today's work most because of the travel opportunities. 
I got to go to Henessey and Ingalls that I've been intrigued by since I re-saw <b>Heat</b>(multiple times) and it was everything I thought it would be and more. So many amazing books on architecture that it was all extremely inspiring. I kind of felt like the first time I opened a Bartok score along with a recording when I was a music major. I got lost in this book about Czech palaces and another on contemporary work in Scotland. If allowed, I could easily drop several thousand in that store... a really wonderful experience.

We actually share a lot in common, and more importantly we shared a lot in common during a time in our lives where we knew few if any people who shared those things in common. In a lot of ways we are very like-minded even though we definitely have our individual tastes and styles of musicianship and music appreciation. We used to be at odds about certain things but I think we've found our equilibrium. We played some Emperor today and it was really fucking great. Funny thing is we had never rehearsed any of the parts together but we had coincidentally covered them all. He had the rhythm parts when I had the leads and melodies and vice versa. There were no unisons or missed entries, it was really amazing and made me feel really energized. Later we actually worked on some original material that was really great writing and I can't wait to develop it. 
Later in the evening we cooked some really good bratwurst which was a great idea. We talked a lot about some music that I had showed him amongst other things. We also watched a bit of Andrew Blake's masterpiece Decadence - his first experience with the director and pretty much one of my absolute favorite pieces of art. The soundtrack is really enveloping. We were both talking about how much of a trip it was, for lack of a better word. It almost feels like a CIA mind-control project. I highly recommend this work to anyone unfamiliar with this master of human expression.

Also working for a national corporation has its perks of getting in touch with people there, so work for me isn't a problem. The second day I was there I fould this amazing room in this huge house on a hill in what is technically considered Eagle Rock in North LA, its about halfway between Glendale and Pasadena. The view is really awesome, you can see all the north hils and I like the way the land is up there. Long story short I got really lucky with a great deal.
The wedding was amazing. I can't believe how many good looking people are in my family. As usual I was in a whirlwind trying to catch up with as many people as possible and thoroughly enjoying the apple martinis. I got in touch with a really close friend who I hadn't talked to in probably nine or ten years and look forward to spend much more time with him after I move next week. He and his girlfriend are two really wonderful people and are very, very smart. We talked about a lot of things, from Neoclassicist music cross overs to how England began World War One--he actually told me a lot about that which I didn't now, some of it really blowing me away. It was really obvious why were such good friends when we were kids. Not because we shared the same views or any of that, just in manner of speaking, how we connect..hes really like the brother I never had. Also a lot of my other cousins were there that I plan on being in much closer contact with to everyone's delight. A lot of big things are going to happen in LA.

This was a really amazing experience for me and I really had a <b>wonderful</b> time. I really can't wait to go back, in fact I didn't really even want to come back while I was there. 

I actually have a lot more to write, I left out the best parts. All in due time."

"event","I had extremely vivid and weird dreams last night so I wanted to write them down before I forgot them later in the day. 

Let's see where did it start?...The earliest thing (I think) I can remember is that Victoria was sleeping with some guy that I was very unhappy about. He was very skinny and pale with a lot of freckles. Mostly he was just extremely stupid and I was completely confused as to what she saw in him, but she tried to assure me that there was more than met the eye. I dismissed that entirely. 
I retired back to my parents house, and the yard had been extended from some land acquisition. I spent the night outside in this little area under some trees with my computer and keyboard making music the whole night. My dog was there and my grandparents were staying with us too. I came in around 4am and they were both up and my grandpa was kind of joking around with me telling me he got me something but decided to throw it away because I spent to much time on playing music. It was a very large muffin. A banana-bread with walnut muffin. And it was extremely difficult to eat, both my grandparents refusing I fail to devour it entirely. As I was eating it, a large amount of walnuts were falling into the sink below and for some reason they looked so good I would try to catch as many as possible. My grandma encouraged this as they weren't walnuts they told me, but imported pecans. Then things got more weird...

I had to pay Victoria a visit at her new friend's house to bring by some car or somehow arrange for rides or something. When I got there they were just talking and having a great time and I just wanted to get back home really. Somebody had suggested that I would lighten up and be able to appreciate the situation if I got to know the pale skinny guy's girlfriend. She was Asian and I think her name was Karen. Someone said something about her being into bloodletting and that I would find it interesting. So I go into this bedroom with this extremely weird girl, Karen and she starts instructing me on what to do: I'm supposed to make an incision on under her right arm and then then left, try to seperate the skin a little and let as much blood flow as possible. ""...Ok..."" so I begin and she has a very difficult time with it and is in obvious pain. ""Do you want to stop?"" at this point there's kind of a lot of blood everywhere but I'm just confused at her obvious lack of experience with this and she says ""lets just do something sexual to even out the pain"" - whatever. It was extremely akward and unnatural and I'm wondering if this girl is comfortable with anything, so I leave and all around weird place that I didn't want to be in. 
I get screwed over with the cars somehow and end up driving this ugly ass cherry red honda accord home.

When I get there this is sonofabitch in a green Bronco parked ON my parents lawn. So I step out and ask him what I can do for him. This shitheel steps out of the car in jeans, flannel and a stupid baseball-type hat and pulls out these two double barrel shotguns, one of which was sawed off. My dog comes out and now I'm just worried about her. Then he tells me that he found both of these in our trash can and that my fingerprints are on them. I ask him if he knows my name and he's silent, so I know hes full of shit about the fingerprints. ""Do you know what a sawed-off double barrel can do?"" ""Yeah I'm pretty well-aware I don't need a fucking demonstration okay slick?"" (I don't think I really called him slick but its a good word.) He loads it, points it away from me and shoots both barrels at once. The barrells looked like 6-gauges or something because they were huge and extremely loud. It pounded threw my head and for an instant I felt like I had gotten shot in the head in the split-second-surreality of dream fabrication.
What happened next was just disgusting. My teeth started falling out. First just a few and then it was like a waterfall of somekind. The blast or something had dislodged one of my teeth and the rest just fell out like pieces of glass from a smashed picture frame. Some of the teeth were really oddly mishapen too. All I could think about was hideous I was going to look and how I didn't want to go through the complications of recovering from a massive oral injury again like I did when I was 10. After about 30 minutes of panic, my teeth were pretty much normal except for one or two that had actually fell out. What was really suprising is that my family was very calm and methodical about the whole thing and I was the one who was panicking. 
After that this black family came to our house and told us that the guns were theirs and their kids had found them or acquired them somehow and they wanted to just dispose of them. They apologized and said they didn't mean to cause any trouble. They had a grey-golden retriever and it was an amazing animal. I kept asking them questions about the breed and they kept ignoring me. 
I stepped outside and there was an enormous crime scene crew in my front yard as if a mass grave or something had been exhumed. I was very confused. Two of the crew members where wearing the Police style raincoats that say ""Homicide"" or ""Forensics"" on them...but their said ""Incompetence."" I have no idea what that meant. I'm not even the kind of person who harbors resentment for law-enforcement. I have no idea why my mind created that image. 

A very vivid dream with lots of bizarre scenes.

A note about my livejournal: To my mind, this community/software provides two purposes. Firstly, to provide a permanent, universal, international journal for your ideas or just space to write in however you wish to please. Secondly, since it's tied to other people via friends pages and random non-ljuser's visitations, it can be used as a mass message board. 
Except for certain very obvious circustances, this journal is where I put <b>my</b> thoughts, for me. I'm happy that other people I know are interested in my life, and in some ways I'm a little flattered that people even read the stuff I write. 
I felt like I had to make this clear, that my primary intention is to have a written, digital, univeral record of my life now and again. More than once have I gotten myself in ""trouble"" so to speak because of things I have written. I excerise tact and consideration but dishonesty is very often worse than anything.

"event","The day I get to go prom dress shopping, I end up getting my period. What is that shit all about? I was out for about maybe less than two hours and my crmps were killing me. It put a great damper on my whole trip. There aren't that many good looking prom dresses out there, than again, I am not a dress person, so dresses don't come to a natural liking to me. But, I came home and slept for a good two hours and that helped out.

 But, I guess the main point of writing is to complain about that feeling of needing someone but not being able to be with them. It's not that you feel like you can call it love, just that tiny little looming feeling inside that tells you that whenever they're not around something of you is missing to and that life just gets boring until they come around to bring you back up to your feet. Ever feel that way?

Me: I think i'll just make Tera be like but Ron, I..I like you ::blush:: lol
Ron: No dont!
Ron: That will make things weird
Ron: Dont fuck my game over
Ron: lol
Me: I thought that time you tried killing me was special...::shuffles her foot::
Ron: Dont you dare!
Ron: o.o
Me: I mean...the way you held me and forced me to my knees, it was just so...erotic and sexy.
Me: LOL
Ron: LOl!!
Ron: Dude you so going down
^ Inside joke between Ron and I.But, I still found it humurous.
-------------------------------------
The King: What was that for? 
Buttercup: Because you have always been so kind to me, and I won't be seeing you again since I'm killing myself once we reach the honeymoon suite. 
The King: Won't that be nice. She kissed me

Miracle Max: Go away or I'll call the Brute Squad.

"event","Holy Jesus on a stick. I haven't written in this thing in god knows how long. So, lets do the usual update on my little life. Moegi (japanese exchange student) has been living with me for the past week (I think). I've gotten back into roleplay and fucked up (as usual) I've been in World of Warcraft, got my Tauren Druid to lvl 37 and now taking what I would call a break from the game. Umm..Allison has a car, go Allison.
 Shit been boring as usual. Pissed off about the banning law of SMOKING in public areas (even thinking about public PARKS), yes..someone five miles away might catch a hint of my second hand smoking and catch cancer. Lord almighty, best watch out. Umm, everything else that I can think of is pretty irelivent (sp). Mind you I am not good with spelling large ""intellectual"" words

"event","Holy shit, it's been a long time since I've written in here. Alright first of all, life has been decently good compared to when I was constantly on my computer. Now I am constantly hanging out with Tuby and the gang which makes me feel like I'm stalking them. 
  The group news has it that one, Bill and I are dating and have been for a little while now. It's a pretty good relationship compared to my others, well some. Thomas and Katie broke up and he's really sad and I worry. Katie is ignoring him and will be for acouple months as she said and Mike is lecturing Thomas and telling him to stop being selfish and being sad because it makes Katie sad. The whole situation is fucked up and in my head, Katie is just kind of being a bitch about all this. I also told Thomas no more hurting himself. Moegi has been hurting herself too, but Tuby and he worked out the problem and I am happy, 'cause a cut up wife, is not the coolest thing.
  World of Warcraft: Ah, my first Warcraft game and I got addicted to it. It's like EverQuest. It's addicting and very fun. I play every night after I come home from Tuby's. Usually from 8-9PM to 12-1AM. Then I go to bed. I am only lvl 15 though, half way to 16.
   School has been going fine, good classes, good teachers, no troubles with other students, though there does feel like there's something missing when I go there, not to sure what it is but there is.
   Supposively I got booted from roleplay, and I think it's total shit. I am not quitting roleplay unless my Pops (Cory) or Zanny (Tye) tell me that I am out and I have no choice but to quit. Those silly Jap realm people are nuts. But hell, I understand where they are coming from to. But all and all I still say they should shove that shit back up their ass, because I don't give a damn. ^_^
 
Well, that's all for now.

With Jake, damn if he wasn't a fox and funny, just a complete stoner and was entirely gone in the head half the time. I just kind of feel awkward and bad about the Joseph thing, because I believe he does like me, maybe that's like superficial for me to say, but whatever. He gives Bill evil glares and sometimes goes quiet. I don't really have the balls to say anything to him about it though. So hopefully Bill or Thomas will break it to him nicely and he wont be mad or stop being my friend.

I went back to sleep though and my mom woke me up around 11:30AM and I got up and called Bill back. I had my mom make me some scambled eggs and cheese, which was totally awesomely good :o.
 I cleaned my room for about 2 hours and did actually do some good progress on my room and kind of want to finish cleaning it up, hahah. Then I went to Tuby's or well he picked me up and I ran to Jon's house for some smokes and had to stop at Gamestop or something like that. When we returned I watched the guys play some games, talked to Tuby's mom for awhile too. I had Ryan drop me off at my house for a second because I got my period :( and then we stopped at his house for Magic cards and then to get some food.
 We returned and Thomas and I played a round of Halo 2 together with only swords and plasma gernades. Kekeke. Eventually we started watching Ichi the Killer, which I thought was a totally fucked up yet awesome movie. Before we all left I played another 3-4 rounds of Halo and got my ass kicked around. 
 It was Rico's birthday today, but it wasn't anything special like we normally do for birthdays. Probably because we were all broke, lol. So; Mike, Rico, Joseph, Thomas, Bill, Tuby, Sutich, Ryan and I just hung out.

"event","I went to school and went to the Mall of America. It was fun, but my feet got sore. Only walking for like 2-3 hours, but hey, I'm a lazy bastard. After that, I went to Tuby's and watched the Grudge. Then Thomas and Sutich showed up. Thomas, Joseph, and Tuby played a round of Magic. Though Thomas quit early to play a game of Slayer Halo2 with Bill, Moegi, and I. It was fun. Then we did our ol' fashioned team slayer, the team mostly being Bill, Moegi and I again. Though we switched up the players about the second to the last game. I didn't play the last one. 
  When we were leaving, I thought I was going to stay, but everyone ""piled"" into the car except Bill, Thomas, and I. We talked for a few minutes before Joseph came back in and ask if we are coming. I got mad and yelled a little, at least the stern voice bitching how I didn't want everyone in the car. Not only because Tuby's mom would have yelled at us, but it just pisses me the fuck off. Thank you very much. Joseph and Thomas stayed home and Bill, Tuby, Moegi, Sutich and I went.
  Everyone says, Joseph flirts with me, because he likes me, though Joseph says stuff that makes him seem like he doesn't. Bill kind of seemed pissed and was going to tell Joseph that we are dating now. It's cute. Tuby wants to go to the California Cafe for Valentines day. I think we should go someplace less well known so it's not so crowded, but that's just me.

"event","Well, I woke up around 1:00 PM and ended up going over to Tubys. My mom was at work and I told her I'd come home to help her work for spending $100 of emergency money she left when she went away on their trip. Speaking of which, we had a damn close call. My brother and I thought my parents were getting home around 6:40PM Saturday night, but instead they were booked on a earlier flight and got to the airport sometimg late around 4-5PM. My brother, Katie, Thomas, Bill and I all cleaned the house as fast as possible, lol. Thank god for their help. x.x.
 Anyways, I went to Tuby's and we watched part of Evil Dead and Army of Darkness, then I began watching Dawn of the Dead (again) basically because I wanted to hear the Johnny Cash song. Umm, we played a few rounds of Halo 2 and the guys played video games as usual. Bill bought Half Life 2, which is a good game from what I've seen. Ummm, I had a few cigarettes, lol. I also was a tad bit weirded out because I heard that Best Buy smelt like me or I smelt like best buy. I guess I smell like big industry, but to Bill and I, I just smell like low low prices, lol. I've been spending a lot of time close to Bill. I mean, I've heard Joseph likes me and I don't want to hurt his feelings and shit, cause Joseph is my friend, but I don't like him that way. I just like him as a friend. Though, I do appreciate Bill saving my ass most of the time. I'd be fucked if I was alone half the time. If Joseph ever reads this, well all I have to say is sorry and hope that he understands and gets the idea. :O

Which is totally awesome. >.>; I am getting a lot better at avenging my own death by sticking people with plasma gernades and blowing them up just after I die. Or sticking them and getting blown up because they corner me -.- One of the two. But, I am also getting the hang of the smg. And I don't fear playing against Bill half as much. I think it's just more frightening for the fact well...you see him one second and then he's gone. Or you don't find him what-so-ever and then BAM Rikimaru killed Mr. Right. It's a lot funner when we have more people together, or when it's Tuby and I on a team, lol. I always kill people by accident with a rocket launcher when we're on Team Slayer. Just say, spawning by me, or being infront of me is not a good idea."

"event","Lately, I've been spending a lot of time hanging out with Tuby, Bill, Joseph and Moegi. On some days Allison might hang with us but usually she's with Kevin and Donny. We normally just play Halo2 but we've also been watching movies because the only time they have movie nights/days is when I am around. We are trying to use the most of the days up to good use because we are not certain if we'll be able to see Moegi as often as we do. It's kind of sad. It's like ripping Moegi away from her friends when she's not at school. 
Problems have arose amongst the crew. It seems Joseph likes me which makes me feel a bit awkward since I am usually sitting next to Bill or even on his back when we play Halo2. Joseph plays with my hat, leans on my head, it really doesn't bother me so much except the fact I know he may or does have a slight crush on me. I think I just feel kind of sad that I am just going to blow Joseph off. It's not about the way he looks or how he acts, it's just he's not the right person I am looking for so I am not going to give it the chance if I know how it will end up. I just don't want to be mean to him because Joseph is still one of my good friends.
This whole week has been crazy, I haven't been home very often and my brother has been throwing parties nearly every single night. Drinking, smoking the works. I am not going to help him clean unfortunately because most of the mess is his to begin with and the fact I probably wont be home. I feel guilty for spenind my moms emergency money, but I used it for food, gas, and more food. Anyways, I am really sleepy.
Time for me to go to sleep.

"event","People think of me as a bitch, kind, funny, and all these other ideals of adjectives you can throw into the pile. I don't see the harm in honestly, cruel or not. Even I can lie to people about things and not truely feel guilty about it. I think being honest is the best way to be, blunt or not. I would prefer being honest and crush someone just so they know the truth. Tell them they are ugly, tell them that they are annoy and to go fucking kill themselves to rid us of their annoyance. But, I can't always say that. I see good in people and I see bad. I don't see much good in myself because I haven't exactly done anything that I consider to be good. I do little things here and there like buy someone something, but that isn't considered good at all. I hate society, I hate homeless, I hate rich people. I hate flaws, yet I rather see everything be completely fucked up and equal. Yet not all the same to an exact point. Lately, people have been getting on my nerves. 
 I suppose I shouldn't be bitching in my live journal. It's not necissarily a problem, yet it is such a problem that I feel the need to write about it. Tuby of course is right though. One can't bitch about their problems because there'll always be someone out there worse than you. Basically all you can do is live your life the way it is, with a lot of hatred and a lot of happiness. Bite your pride, bury your face in shame and smile.

"event","First off, I will rant about friends. What is a friend? I think it would be someone that you can trust, be honest with and not feel any sort of guilt around. What determines who will become your friend? Or, how do you find what you like in a friend? What makes someone more than a friend, and less of one? Are 'best friends' really, the best? And is a person you've met or hung out with several times considered a friend? Or is there a boundary to who are your friends and who isn't? I don't know. I don't know who are my friends, best friends, semi-friends. Or anything really. Sure, I know some people I can trust and are my, indeed, friends. But I just don't understand what makes people be friends. Is it dependancy? A crutch? Someone to lean on? Is it a mutual thing, where you get something and the friend gets something out of the relationship? Can it be parasitic? Where you use someone for a feeling you get when being with them. I guess I could consider some, well, one in particular, of my ""friendships"" parasitic at times. I have a need to be around a type of person, and this person fulfills my need for the type, so adequately, that I require a quantity of this person's company. But also, can guys and girls just be friends? Of course, yes, but isn't there always some kind of questionable feeling/urge/anything of the sort that you feel necessary to inquire about? Sure, I have male friends that I just want to be friends with, quite a few actually. And I'm more comfortable with them than I would be with someone I could consider more. But, the real point is that... What makes one friend more desireable than the next? I do like guys as friends more, only because there's no womanly bickering that occurs, also, the fact that I do like to play videogames and just chill - which girls don't tend to do very often. I just don't know. The whole friends thing is just old. Does someone absolutely without-a-doubt need friends? I wish I did not. Sometimes relationships altogether are too complicated. I can name a few currently, and will be tomorrow.

I left school early since Andrew seems to always leave after 3rd period and I had him drop me off at Sibley so I could go chill with Tuby. Moegi, Tuby and I went out on a little card ride for about two hours looking for one damn story, United Noodle, which in fact I kept calling oriental noodle. ::Coughs:: I aint to bright in the head.

Our regular games of Halo 2 usually happen on Fridays and Saturdays when a group of us will get together and duel it out in team slayer or just a regular ol' fashion kill anyone you see and more. Tuby, Joseph and Bill are the regulars that tend to kick the shit out of everyone, especially Bill. Thomas believes he can only snipe, but that's not true. Ryan is just a run around and kill, still getting good at the game. Moegi is getting a lot better but still tends to be fodder. Blondie is getting the hang of it and is doing a good job at it. Go sniping Donny in the face! Myself, I suck at it. Lol. I will get people off and on, my highest kills I think was in the 30's.

I got a lot of worthless shit running through my head and I have school tomorrow morning. Katie offered to drive me and Nick and Eli are suppose to pick me up. I have to go to band practice with them, which shouldn't be so bad. Hopefully I can take a nap or something if it's at Eli's house like usual. ..>> Maybe I can steal back my Soul Calibur II poster they refuse to give back, lol. I guess this entry is more just for the fact I need to rant yet not fully come out to tell you what's on my mind. Kind of a gip dont you think? 
 I'll give you a clue. I am kind of fed up with people. Just certain people. Not everyone. On top of that, I am very worried for Bowser kittie, he seems to be in really bad shape so Nick and I adviced Melissa to take him to the vet. I love that cat so much.

"event","Holy shit, at 5:00AM Saturday morning, my parents went out on a cruise. Which left my brother and I all alone in our house and me to look over it. What a horrible responsibility due to the fact that I am younger than my brother, hah! So, well nothings really been happening. I've been hanging out with Blondie and the crew (Tuby, Joseph, Thomas, Bill) the usual. We play Halo2 most of the time, I spend a good portion of my time falling asleep on one of the beds or someplace on the floor while everyone is playing other video games.
 Saturday night, I slept over at Tuby's house because I didn't really want to come home. I didn't think the night would have been good and well being at Tuby's was a lot of fun. We basically just laid around watching movies, like Troy, Swat and I saw the begining part of Face off. I slept in the other bedroom for Tuby's mothers sake, even though none of us are dating. Tuby been a little edgy lately about the Moegi thing, but I don't blame him. His ordeal is a real shit in the pants.
 Today, I came home late after watching Fellowship of the Ring with Tuby, Moegi and Bill. Joseph and Thomas left early. Then Tuby drove us all home and I've been hanging out with Nick, Melissa, Jenny, Satan, Sarah, Eli, Tim, Gabe, and I think that's it. We played cards and Tetris, they smoked and drank. Was a fairly good night, loud but good. Plus I was acting as Jenny's personal bodyguard after Melissa left, lol
----------------------
And there's nothing better than a interesting quote to finish this all off.
Eddie: Hey Nick, we should go take a shower together ::says in a sarcastic drunk tone::
::Nick picks up a pillow about to throw it at Eddie::
::I lift my hand and foot up closest to him::
Me: Put the fucking pillow down
Me: ::Looks to Eddie and points:: And no more gay comments
::Nick, Eli, and Andy all bust out laughing::
::Eli say something about how good I burned Eddie, followed in by Andy and Nick laughing and agreeing. Eddie just laughing yet has a stupid look on his face like he doesn't know what to say next.::

"event","The man was alone, shrouded by the darkness of the empty room about him. He was squatted down on the floor, his arms wrapped about his knees, his face pressed into them. Sobs were the only noise that escaped his lips, teardrops falling to the carpet beneath him. The white carpet was soaked beneath where his feet were placed, the patch around him visibly darker than that of the rest of the room. His knees came forward, his hands moving ahead of them to fall palms-down on the white carpet. Upon doing it splotches of red began to form. There was more than tears coming from him, blood was leaking down his face. The droplets from his chin were a mixture, a clear fluid with swirls of red. Each droplet fell upon the floor, and with each sob another spot was added.
	He raised his face, beginning to utter words, seeming speaking to himself. ""Repay your debts, fool that is Eubuleus,"" he interrupted himself with another sob. His voice was quiet, full of hatred. ""So much experience, and yet your name still betrays you,"" he slammed a fist upon the floor, anger swelling within him. His voice raised to a shout. ""Should the unrecognized face of your servant decend upon the true life of the one he's shaped, then you lose that which keeps your very existence!"" Upon the end of his ranting he broke down, crying as his blood-stained face pressed against the carpet. His plees were muffled, ""The task was done, repay your debts."" More sobbing, ""Please repay your debts.""
	A click. Light shone into the room, however when the man looked to the door it was shut. Light came through the doorway, a figure crawling through the woodwork. It spoke not, and yet the man understood. He spoke again, pleeing with the figure. ""Please, repay your debts!"" The figure stood before him, a shadow whose face was only a mask. The intricate designs resembled that of a human skull. ""Please,"" the man begged once more, ""Please repay your debts!"" The figure stood, silent, the empty holes of the mask staring into him. ""I have done your deeds, repay your debts!"" The figure moved towards him, standing only a foot away. A cold feeling rushed over the man, his entire body trembling both with fear and despair. His voice was now hopeless and quiet, ""Repay your debts.""

--- Numbwer 2 writting
A boy stands against the world, young in age and yet defiant of the species lower than him. He is told that although they are lesser, they are to remained unscathed. Now he has gone against his master's will, and so his master does that which he knows will teach the boy a lesson. The boy was told to assist in the forming of a colony, the ants thriving as they spread further and further out. Their hands never slapped, they were free to roam about. Unlike the boy. The boy was restricted to this island, the island in the ocean. He could never leave. It was against the rules.
	The ants had no fear of that around them, the colonies occasionally engaging each other over territory. This provided mild interest, and his master was pleased. The ants feared only one thing. His master, bearing the mask formed in the shape of his own skull. When he would come within their sight, they would flee to the colonies. Battles would cease, only for the moment that he was present. When he had passed, one at a time the ants would return.
	However, in recent times the ants had become defiant. They had refused to see him or his master as the superior. They now freely battled under his master's observation, they were arrogant. The master was not pleased.
	If the ants could defy his master, why could the boy not do so? And so the boy set about building a boat. He remained faithful to his master, but he moved to leave. He was caught, his master placing him in front of the ants, forcing him to watch them battle each other. ""Look,"" he said, ""This is what you have created. You cannot abandon it. You must remain here. Your creation has become arrogant, they no longer recognize their superiors. Do you know how this is fixed?"" The boy shook his head, fearful of what his master might say. However, he already knew. His master spoke again. ""They must be punished, they must be shown that their instinct is correct, that what they think is wrong. They no longer fear us, and so we must force them to."" And with this his master cast water upon the battles, all ants upon the surface washed away and lost. ""Look,"" the master said, ""I have taught them fear, and they will rebuild once again, and once again they will flourish. Some day, we will again be forced to punish them. You may not abandon them."" The lesson was learned.

I created a Get well card for Sensei, I felt completely dumbfounded when she kept saying arigato and I couldn't remember what you're welcome was in japanese so I just said it's okay in japanese and you're welcome in English, hahah.
 I stopped to say hello to my german teacher and my sister, Jessica just so happened to be in there and I gave her a hug and she was like you smell like cigarettes and I was like, I bet I do with Ina smoking in the car and looked to my teacher smiling guilty-like. He just looked at me with this look, ""Allison you should not be smoking"" look. Tuby drove me home and basically I have been in my bed all day, doing a little of roleplay and sparing with Eddie. I also talked to Allison about some things, ah she's so fun to talk to on the phone, lol. Later this night I talked to Joe-Joe on the phone, poor kid was tired as hell. Eventually he went to sleep and I've been talking to Josh the rest of the night, doing another roleplay with him between Blue and Ookami. Woo. I also talked to Andrew for acouple minutes, conversations never last long with him, but that's probably because I have nothing to talk about.
Well anyways, I have to pee again and sneeze, maybe i'll even drop a load in the toilet, hahahahah! Just fucking with you, but I do have to pee and sneeze.

Alright, no one get me wrong, Andrew's a cool kid. But, he's like geeking out on me because I had made plans with other people and it didn't involve him. Now, maybe it's just me, but it sounds rather self-centered to act like if I do anything that just because he wants to hang out, I got to drop my plans and bring him with like I'm his mom or something :/
And yes, they are kind of like a bubble. They don't care if you come over to hang out, but they need to get used to you to be apart of their little group. They aren't selfish and such, but there's a reason for it if you think about it.

No hard feelings to Andrew about all this, but it was bothering me the way he over-reacted over it. ::Shrugs:: Then again, I'm not the most sensetive person either, so he'll probably take this the wrong way just like anyone else would."

"event","Character: Tera Flames

Situation: Well, everyone here's the deal. I do this dice roleplay and when I first had my character Tera back on AIM. I had a big hand in the fall of the Black Market the first time, bringing Zanjin in and he slaughtered a bunch of people. Well now after all these months, Black Market is back and under new management, Shiro and Tersa Right. I am weak in dice, so the odds of me being able to take it down alone are very slim, but it must be brought down because there is too much corruption taking place in the United States roleplay. But, as I have previously mentioned, my brother, Larson aka Sage told me that if I did not submit and become evil like I should be, then a innocent would die in my name and have it be known. He will even kill those in his ranks, people I do or do not know, it doesn't matter because the blood will be on my hands. If I even meet up with someone from the Black Market, any confrontation, he will kill someone. 

Problem: If I surrender to them, I spare innocent lives. But, if I do that, then it will be like if I had only surrendered to clear my name from being branded and hated for being the cause of innocent peoples deaths. If I go after the Black Market, not only is it a slim chance of winning, but it is also one of my own personal vendetta kind of ordeals and that would be selfish of me. Either decision is selfish.

Answer: Someone give me their outlook on what they would do in the consideration of being pure, being good. To do good acts. Now see keep in mind in dice roleplayng I am very weak and a lot of people I am up against are much stronger than me. Let alone I have many enemies and many people keeping promises to the old Black Market ruler, Mr. Right. What can I do, without being selfish? What would be the right thing to do in this situation? Let people die because I want to destroy one source of corruption and be dubbed as my personal vendetta. Or turn myself in and go evil, sparing lives of innocent corrupteds and still have the risk of being killed and beaten."

That I was in this house with loads of people, it was kind of like a party, distinct faces that I knew were Allison, Jon, Ray, Ingrid and some other people from Creative Arts. Well the most rememorable part was a bunch of us were heading into this unfinished basement and well it was very odd. I could hear this voice, this maniacal laughter. In truth it was Hyena laughing, it was very disturbing. I had no idea where it was but I was booking it out of there fast and when I was half way up the stairs I saw on a support beam, it said Media Room no. 9. 
 Then I heard screams, and I was gone, running up the stairs, everyone was in a paniac, people shouting around me and people saying that someone had already lost a arm. I ran into this overly large bathroom. I let some people in, like Allison and others, while I was closing the door I saw the Hyena and he saw me. He ran after where I was and lept the door since it didn't seem to be ""attached"" to the wall and he bit me right between the hand and the wrist. Allison was helping me get it off. It tried to bite her face and we both were holding it at bay. Jon came up and stabbed it behind the back of the neck with something and it's head blew up. End of that one but there was three more. 
-End scene-
 Next thing I knew, Allison and I were sitting in this cage up over a city, like Hollywood and on a ledge this little puggy thing was sitting there watching. Anything in the cage that movoed turned translucent and stuck in a box, even changed into a animal where it went on this bar line to be sold for money. Allison was moviing and I told her not too so we wouldn't have to suffer that.

I don't really remember much after that, but it was very bizzare, lol. When I sleep I am liking to dream crazy dreams or nightmares, nothing pleasent. It's a curse."

"event","Today, I felt like shit, my stomach was bothering me and I had a really bad headache. On a lighter note though, school wasn't so bad. Some dancers came in and they were good, the little girl they brought in was really adorable. Jon boughy my cigarettes, thank god I really needed them. I went home early just at the begining of third period and came hoem and got much needed rest. I laid around the house and got food from my mom.
 I talked to Eddie, Josh, Joe, Mike, Karin, Vanessa and Larson. My brother, he is very corrupted now. He is even the replacement King of the Jo-men. I'm so proud of him, yet so disappointed. It's okay though, heh. He seems maniacally happy being so evil (brother I mean Larson, not Nick)

"event","Well, this was the biggest load of bullshit I have had to go through all night. Alright to explain this clearly, I began living in the basement for a long period of time, giving my cable box to my brother because he never had one. So after so many months I decided, I want to move back into my room and hey, look I did. Whoopie. Now I finally got my TV back from Eli's house and hooked it up, for the longest time, I just had to watch DVD's because I had no cable box. So I decided I am going to use the one from the basement exercise room. I've had it for oh maybe two days.
  So now get this, around 1:00AM I go to turn my TV on and the cable box isn't on, I turn on my light and it's gone. I find out my moms up in the kitchen so I go ask her and my mom tells me that my dad wants that cable box in the exercise room and we'll buy me another one. And now here's the real shit kicker...My dad doesn't go to that room very often, maybe one or twice ever 2-3 months. So, you know he takes the cable box out of my room which I use every day to put it back in a place where it's hardly used and will make me wait till they get a new one...
  Why don't they let me have my cable box and buy a new one for downstairs...-_- These people are killing me, just killing.

"event","Oh dear merciful god. I want to start another roleplay war where rules are actually abided by and people can understand them and not whine like little girls. Basically what everyone else did because I guess I was just overly prepared for a simple Free Form war. I want to go against Josh. 
  I think it would be lots of fun, unfortunately what is left of the free form roleplay is nothing more than a dead empty husk. Only a very few handful of original roleplayers are left in the general area and I am only left with two, Joe and Josh. But, perhaps maybe Allison, Yuri, Mark and Bryan would participate, maybe even Pat. I don't know I want the old gang back together like the good ol' days of Klickalack Tavern (which will never happen) Wishful thinking though.
 
[!!] Vampires vs Werewolves [!!]

Not many roleplays read my livejournal, so it makes no difference, but if you got any interest at all, hit me up sometime, because I can tell you mostly what you need to know about the Lycanthropes, Vampires however I know very little on. That's why Joshipoo is the vampire and I am the wolf. ::Snickers:: Hail the victorious howlers!"

Granted it was fun, I went and spent the morning with Sensei and her first hour Japanese class, which is Japanese...3? 4? I don't remember, but it's a small class and she was making food. I had stuff I have never had before in my life, was stuffed beyond compare. I went to my school after and well I was out of smokes, it was HELL. And I kind of slept through 2nd and 3rd period. I felt really bad for my teachers 'cause I was out like a damn light. Then I got a ride home from Ingrid, god bless her. And later tonight Allison and I went over to Jon's house to watch Garden State. Which I might add was a terrific movie. The guy knows how to pick his movies.

Josh: The fact that you're lying!

"event","Have you ever wondered which hurts the most?
Saying something and wishing you hadn;t?, or
Saying nothing and wishing you had?
I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say. Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them.
If you do, they might break your heart..If you don't you might break theirs.
Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you aldready had with that person.
Your heart decides whom it likes and whom it doesn't.
You can't tell your heart what to do, it does it on its own...When you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.
Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was to afraid to let you?
Too many of us stay walled up because we are to afraid to care too much.
For fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at all.
Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle.
We tell lies when we are afraid..afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.
But everytime we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger.
Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump.
Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have done, or could have had.
*What would you do if everytime you fell in love you had to say good-bye
*What would you do if everytime you wanted someone they would never be there
*What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt?
(even if it's that you don't care anymore)
*What would you do if you loved someone more than ever and you couldn't have them?
*What would you do if you never got the chance to say I am friends with all my family and they know I love them?
People live, but people die, I want to tell you that you are a friend.
If you died tomorrow (God forbid)
You would be in my heart
Would I be in yours?

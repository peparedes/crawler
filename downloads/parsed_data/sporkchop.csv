"event","I got 90% on my Women's Studies paper that I wrote in 1 night and 75% on the exam that I barely studied for.  This is not too bad.  

I had a bunch of revelations last night, but forget them all now.  

I'm confused as of now.  Just make it better.

We jammed yesterday and finished another song...it's really good.  Not too fancy...more strumming, but it sounds cool and faster...with really cool drums and different than anything we've ever done...as usual.  Mel is going to have one giant muscley leg soon.  I really like it...the song, I mean.  We've just got to get the whole thing flowing and it'll be nice.  We almost have a full set list of original songs now, I think.  I love that we can get things done so much faster now.  

This song brings me back to the old days when Laura and I had our Closing Time band....we were so cool. Any time we would get near a guitar and a piano...we'd bust out. I found a tape of us singing and acting like morons.  It's great."

I was all set for a night of nothing, when I talked to Andrew and he said ""come to my house and watch star wars""...or something like that...so I did, but the right star wars wasn't on so we watched other tv and movies.  It was still great fun.  And now, I giggle.

I feel a bit better than earlier today.  The uncertainty still hasn't settled down, but I hope with time and knowledge, that it will.

"event","Not feeling too much better today.  I could use some reassurance and certainty.  I could use a friend who shows they care...but as of now, it seems no such person exists.  I'm not feeling sorry for myself, but there are times in my life, when even when I am surrounded by the best of friends, I feel alone.  I'm confused..and I need you to know and tell me that everything is going to be okay.  I apologise for my outbursts at times, and I apologise for burdening you with my feelings.  

<lj-cut text=""survey""> 
-have you had a colour that you've loved forever? yes

-was it a primary colour? no

-do you regard black and white as actual colours instead of the the total lack or overabundance of colour? I used to until I became an art major...they've crammed all that colour information into my head.  Black is not a colour unless you add a colour too it, making it a shade of that colour...white is not a colour unless you add a colour to it, then it makes it a tint.

-do you think that a yes or no answer to that question has a deep psycological meaning? no

-is love something to be bled for, or something to be enjoyed like wine? it should be something to be enjoyed like wine, but there may be a little bleeding in the process

-Is it possible for your best friend to also be your worst enemy? not worst enemy, but an enemy

-How old do you feel? I think I feel older than I act...I feel younger than I am though.

-If you could name yourself, what would your full name be? what's in a name..

-what album would be your soundtrack on the worst day of your life? well, on the worst day of my life, i think the music i hate most would be playing, either that or a lot of very sad, slow songs that might make me cry, but not one album, a collective list of songs.

-do you think you'll age well? only time will tell

-are genetics on your side? pfft.

-if you could go back in time, would you kill hitler, knowing that it very well could mean a DIFFERENT dictator coming up and doing far worse. OR Would you befriend him and be his right hand man, guide him to dominating Europe, thereby gaining massive amounts of power?  I would honestly rather sit back and watch history run it's course without me affecting it, but knowing what Hitler did, and not knowing that a different dictator might come up and do far worse, I might kill him.  There could always be a chance that a different dictator wouldn't come up.  I would hate to have enough power to dominate Europe, so I wouldn't do that. 


-were Biggie and 2pac's murders just staged events to quell the eastcoast vs. westcoast feud? blah

-would you kill george dubya bush or the millions of idiot voters who couldn't read and thereby made sure an even BIGGER idiot who can't even spell or pronounce regular, everyday words became president?  Killing Bush would only mean that the person who is second in power who is basically telling him what to do, would come into power, making no change, at least the way i see it...but killing millions of ""idiots"" wouldn't do any good either.  They're all morons.

-Admit it, you secretly wish you were in Avril Levigne's (sp?) band. haha...no, but I'm bitter that someone who has very little talent can get so famous.

-has an animal ever died as a DIRECT result of you? (amphibians and other water-borne cretures don't count since they don't have feelings) .  Directly, no, but indirectly, I've taken part in the killing of many things.  Everyone does in some way, by means of consumption.  One time I fed my hamster some weird roots, and I think that might have shortened her life...so then...maybe I did.

-has any manner of normal-culture deviant behaviour ever REALLY appealed to you? yes

-has it ever caused you to go out and do something that you'd never EVER admit to another living soul what you actually did? hmm....i imagine we've all done something like this, although i can't immediately recall an instance.

-in your humble opinion, which of the following feelings are the FURTHEST apart (and feel free to elaborate) : Love & Like or Love & Hate? love and hate.  you start out liking someone before you love them....it is a more difficult process to change from love to hate and vice versa

-would you let ten small defenceless children die horrible deaths so that a nuclear bomb would not be dropped on a highly populated 3rd world city, killing hundreds of thousands or worthless poor people. One of the groups WILL die... which one?  Chances are, there are more than ten small defenseless children in the highly populated third world city, so it would make more sense to let the ten children die, although my morals speak differently.  i'd rather no one dies.


-would you steal from the poor, ignorant needy of the world just to live in total comfort? funny question...don't we really do this already by purchasing things made by poor and needy people who are paid very low, if any wages.  total comfort, to one person, could be the opposite for another.

-do you feel like the ability in you to kill exists without any kind of mental conditioning? perhaps it existed when i was first born, as most meat consuming animals have an ability to kill,  but i've been taught that killing is bad...so maybe it's the opposite.  i've been mentally conditioned not to kill.

-(disregard this question if you haven't read the book) would lord of the fles be different if it were all girls instead? it would all depend on the group of girls.  Some girls would be complete ""savages"" like the boys in the book, while others who were taught differently, would probably be less so.  

-Can jealosy and love coexist? Certainly.  If not jealousy, then something similar...or something like hurt.  But, if the love is mutual, then perhaps not.  I wouldn't know.

-where and what time were you born? Thunder Bay...general hospital 6:48 pm, February 20th, 1984

-what is your astrological sign? pisces

-were you born with any unusual markings or birth 'defects'? not that i know of.  my mom said i didn't really cry when i was born, which i guess is different...just looked around in amazement as i took in everything.

-what is your natural hair colour? light brown

-have you ever had anything removed? (aside from teeth) tonsils and i think during that surgery they took out something on the inside of my nose

-do you require glasses? no

-are you a spiritual person? no

-religious? no

-evolution or creation? evolution certainly has more proof than creation.  creation to me, sounds like a bunch of myths.  

-were you raised in a particular denomination? no

-were you ever baptized or partook in any kind of initiation? also no. 

-what happens to us after we die? if i knew, i wouldn't be so afraid.

-god, vengeful or loving? how about, the cause of a lot of the world's conflict

-what is your opinion of abortions? pro-choice

-how about contraception? definitely.

-is sex only for after marriage or are you a sinner? (are you aware that such tame intimacy actions such as open-mouthed kissing, groping/fondling, ""making out"" even WACHING anything vaguely pornographic and not least of all oral sex are all forms of ""inappropriate behaviour"" seriously looked down upon by god and all who fear him?) hahah...sin to the core, i guess.

-non-smoker or are you a sinner? non-smoking sinner?

-abstain from drunkenness, violent behavious foul language and the glorification of it (movies, books, posters, tv, or music) or are you a sinner? oh my...sinner?  if i believed in sins.

-would you say that you had real conviction or are you a mere participant? both

-which of the four seasons are you? it depends on the day and my mood...I could be spring, summer, winter or fall

-classic jeans or one of the many pant alternatives? i like the jeans for the most part...if i could find jean alternatives that i liked around here, i would most definitely go for them.

-Is the enemy of my enemy really my enemy? That depends on the situation.  yes and no.

-how many grandparents do you have left? 2

-don't think about this question, are you a piano or are you a chesterfield? chesterfield

-donkey, ass, or beast of burden? beast of donkey ass?

last question

-what is the greatest thing about your life right now? I'm uncertain at this point.  I've got a good life, and like I said before, I'm not sure I deserve it. </lj-cut>"

Oh my...

So I'm really confused right now.  I would like, for once, to be completely certain of something instead of having doubts.  It's never happened...I'd like to know what it feels like.  It seems any time something might be going right, I'll look for an excuse to make it wrong.  I'm not sure why I do this, but it's really tough...on me and on other people.  I'm doubting everything about myself and my life right now.  I have no direction.  I know I've been pretty happy for quite some time, but that sinking feeling is consuming me yet again.  It's creeping up slowly, but I'm feeling more traces of it every day.  More negativity...more serious doubt.  The things that used to seem constant aren't so anymore.  I feel like some people are pushing me away.  As of now, I'm nothing but background noise.  I've been waking up after getting a full night's sleep and feeling unrested.  I have little energy and no motivation to do anything productive.  I'm not sure what happened to bring all of this on, but it's coming back.  I will try and hide it as best as I can, but it's not always easy to hide something that takes over your mind and body.  My thoughts and actions aren't like other people's.  There are things that most people feel the need for, that I have absolutely no desire for at all.  More and more I question the point of my existance, if there is one.  I don't believe in destiny...I can control who I become, but as of now, I am becoming a worthless being.

So that's about all...I wish I could expand more in this thing...talk about specifics...complete events.  It's not really a journal, when I think about it.  I censor out what I say, knowing that people I know read this.  It doesn't contain many true complete thoughts or feelings.  This is just a censored public forum.  I say what I've done during the day...a few interesting or not so interesting things and then it's done.  This isn't my whole life.  This is only a tiny portion that I choose to share with other people who do or do not care.  The rest of my life, thoughts and feelings are buried deep inside of me...to share with no one but myself.  This is not me."

"event","So here's the deal...haha Ryan is really funny.

He came to class so excited today because he had a Star Wars dream.  It sounded like a cool dream...he said he had it because we talked about Star Wars for so long during our break in drawing yesterday.  He got to fight superheroes with crazy weapons with some crazy little furry guy that I don't remember the name of.  Then all of a sudden...a girl in my class said ""mushrooms"" and it triggered the entire memory of the dream I had last night that I couldn't remember all day.  It was weird.

"event","Hmm...these past couple of days have been a blur...it might take me a moment to recall the events. 

 School was school yesterday...women's studies was awesome...she did a really good lecture...it was very interesting, but somehow after that, I ended up exploding into a fit of rage...getting mad about everything...and I'm sure Amanda and Joan didn't enjoy it. I just got the nicest e-mail from Joan though...hehe...she's a great girl. Basic design calmed me down a bit...nothing like 4 hours of colouring to make things a bit better.  I went out to Laura's after I got home and we played Super Nintendo and then her, Tyler, Andrew and I watched a movie.  Andrew and I went home after and that was that.  

Today...haha I'm not even going to talk about art history too much more since it's the same old thing every time.  Today it was funny.  He was talking about how he noticed the class had drastically dropped in size probably by about 2/3.  Then he asked ""Am I doing something wrong?"".  Dead silence.  It was definitely one of those things that you had to be there for.  Drawing class was only good because Anne bought us danishes.  We started drawing in ink with quills...just like they use in Harry Potter.  I don't know how to draw in ink...people said my drawing looked good, but I really didn't see it this time...it looked like a bunch of scribbles, maybe I'll post it later...I don't get it.  

Speaking of Harry Potter...it's been amusing in class these days.  Yesterday, Ryan and Carissa had a big debate...Star Wars computer games vs. Harry Potter games...I think Star Wars won.  Today Kamila, Ryan and I spent an hour talking about Lord of the Rings and Ryan was telling us how cool Attack of the Clones is...he did the actions and voices for it and everything.  It was great.

Meg called me the other night just to let me listen to Get Out Of My Dreams, Get Into My Car by Billy Ocean, but I was not home.  She's a goof"

"event","Today, I went to art history at 8:30 as usual....absolutely boring...my body was so tired it was twitching to stay awake. Very tough to last for 1.5 hours of that.  After class I walked outside...and it was soo snowy.  Ceramics was also boring.  I can get along with and like a lot of people...most people in fact, but every now and then someone comes across my path that makes me very mad.  One of these people is in my art class...I'm with her a lot of the day...sooo annoying.  ""Look at me...look what I did....Teacher!  I'm good at this...look!""  I'm not even joking that she said that.  Not to mention what a big liar she is.  She makes up lies in order to gain popularity, and since I was in high school with her, I know she's lying about things...such as who her friends are and things that she says she likes, when she refused to like any such thing last year.  I'm not saying people can't change, I'm just saying I don't like her.  I can't tolerate people with GIANT egos, nor can I tolerate someone who doesn't know me, yet seems to enjoy making fun of me while I'm mere feet away.  Why do I care so much about this?  I have no idea.  I told Nathan that I hate her more than Nickelback.

Jamming went okay I guess.  Eva couldn't make it again, but Roxanne and I fixed up some of our older songs and then trashed 2 new ideas for new songs that we came up with last week and the week before and came up with something that we feel is better.  Our music was starting to sound all the same...we were following a pattern, which Mel pointed out...so we changed it up, and I'm liking how the new song sounds..simple, yet good...and faster...we can always use faster songs.  Right after we finished jamming around 9, Jon T and Ryan called us up and asked us if we wanted to go see Bowling For Columbine....wowzers...good movie and a half!  I haven't been that impressed/enraged/amused/frightened by a movie in quite some time.  

I think Laura's having a party tomorrow night...good old middle of the week parties.  I don't know if I'll be able to go...I've got a good deal of homework due on Wednesday, not to mention the fact that my parents might get a little mad that I did that.  I remember doing it the night before university started...haha they weren't impressed.

The show was...no comment.  Worst thing ever, I think.  I got a call from someone in The Rots this afternoon (at first I didn't know who it was and they never actually told me, but I figured it out...and have yet to figure out how they found my phone number) telling me the Apollo said they had nothing booked for today...no show or anything.  This set me into panic mode...spent the entire afternoon talking to Mel and we were both trying to reach Adam to see what was going on....which took a couple of hours.  One of the bands cancelled on us...which is not really a problem...seeing that they weren't a really good band.  So we get to the Apollo...and neither band has all of their members there...so we had to wait forever to put on the show...at this point we figured Sip Yek Nom (Mel showed me their name is just monkey piss spelled backwards) was still coming.  So we had a little problem with both bands bringing their drum kits when Adam only wanted one...which was really our fault for being unorganized...not to mention both bands wanted to play last...and I felt bad for making either one of them play first.  So around 9 or so, we figured Sip Yek Nom wasn't coming...kinda pissed us off since we were told they'd be there earlier.  Not to mention the fact that I feel bad that so many people had to pay $6 for the shittiest show in the world.  I'm not saying the bands were shitty...just the whole situation of people thinking they would get to see 4 bands.  Seeing a table covered in puke wasn't exactly a bowl of cherries either. Marc made us feel a bit better sometimes I suppose.   

I apologise to anyone who paid $6 to get in...or how about to anyone at all...

Despite that it WAS the shittiest show in the world, I still don't mind putting on shows, just maybe not for a while...and maybe next time with some more reliable people.   

After the shit show was over, Mel, Tyler, Jonny T , Ryan and me headed to Seattle for coffee and had a good talk...lots of good music, and some decent hot chocolate.

Women's studies was fun today.  Our tutorial group went into smaller groups and talked about abortion and birth control and things.  I don't really like talking in groups and stuff, but I managed to a bit...grossed out a few people in my discussion group with my weird knowledge about abortion and pro-lifers...haha...it was funny and good.

haha...so...i wore off part of the fingerprint on my right thumb...i know it will come back, but for the time being, i find it funny.  hardcore art stuff.  

i didn't stay home and do homework like i planned last night.  andy called me up and we went to the show then hung out at his house.  it was fun.  we drew lots of pictures. 
the good thing is...i didn't have to do my homework last night like i thought.  my art history prof cancelled class at 8:30 in the morning...after we all sat there for 15 minutes and then got the message he wasn't coming AFTER.  we could have stayed home and slept.  but at least i had more time to do my drawings.  i got all 3 of them done and even had time for a nap after.  i get embarassed when people use my art as examples...my face turns red and kamila laughs.  i don't like being centered out as having the best or worst art.  i left drawing class early because i don't want to draw any more self portraits.  soo tired of looking at myself in the mirror.  i am getting better at them though...i just didn't feel like doing it today..and anne was driving me crazy so i thought it would be a good idea to get up and go.  it will be done at home

Ryan told me that Eva got her recording done...so all Mike has to do is mix it.  

I could eat subs every day...I had another today...it was so good...maybe another tomorrow too?  yum.  

haha oh yeah...and i don't really feel like doing this show on sunday....i feel that nothing good is going to come out of it.  mixing all those genres of music at one show with all 3 local bands wanting to play last, is not a good idea as far as i can see.   

time to make more food...then lino cut up a storm...then read women's studies...sexuality chapter...should be interesting."

I'm sooo hungry...nothing will fill the void in my stomach today.  Well...maybe eating a bit more...I bought a sub from Mr. Sub (or was it subway) at school..so good, but not nearly big enough. Sooo very...hungry...

Basic design was pretty boring...we got to mix colours today...haha...we're really getting up there.

I figured out that the flower people screwed up when they sent me Meg's flowers yesterday...yesterday was January 20, not February 20...I guess they are stupid or something....but she thought it was funny that I got them early.

Andy said I should go to the me tall show tonight...I would like to...a whole lot, but..soo much homework.  3 drawings to do for drawing class..haha. Hopefully we can hang out on Friday if Laura has her little party.  I would like that.

Went to St James to get some cds...it brought sadness in me when I walked in there to see it nearly empty...to see all those people scavenging for cheap cds...if the place was that busy all the time, it wouldn't have to be closing.  So after that, went to The Painted Turtle to get some India ink and a purple pencil crayon.

Laura called me up later...she, Tyler, Andy, Mark and me went to Boston Pizza for food. I had a delicious caesar salad. Afterwards, Mark left and Laura, Tyler, Andy and me went back to Andy's house and watched tv and stuff.  It was fun.  Andy is really cool...he likes the punk music and used to come to watch Jerkbait play and yell things at us on stage...good times.

Meg and I might go to Warped Tour this summer...hopefully in Toronto or somewhere in that area since her and her friends are renting a house around there anyway. She wants to go to St. Louis...cuz...well her boyfriend lives there...I'm not a huge fan of the guy, but whatever makes her happy. I think Toronto would be better...not to mention cheaper.

Yesterday was not so good...mocked by the art history prof in front of the class.  Not sure how many more times I'll want to go back to his class, but meh.  Drawing went okay, despite the fact that when I drew Kamila, she looked like a young dark skinned boy...oh well.

Today...the women's studies seminar proved to be fun.  We just got to get to know everybody in the class...and Lori seems really nice, so it should be okay.  Printmaking...well, I learned this is not my thing after getting a monster blister in one thumb and stabbing myself in the other thumb with a razor sharp lino cutter.  Haha...not so good day.  Then I came home and took a nap, and woke up when Roxanne called to tell me we were going to Colosimo's basement to record.  I was in a better mood after my nap and went to record my guitar for the last song...which didn't take too long.  Eva didn't get hers done, but she's going on Tuesday to do it.  Mike, Mike, Jon T and Ryan lightened things up with their comments and silly things and then played us some of a With Regard set.  Thoroughly enjoyable indeed.  Made my day, actually.  Maybe even my week, as dorky as that sounds.  Now time to go and write more guitar for more songs.  We might do a Sunday jam, I hope, as well as our Monday jam."

Katie and I went to see a movie last night.  It was not a very good movie, but that's okay.  It was nice going with just her.  I know it sounds dumb, but sometimes I just like to go places with one friend.  I guess it's easier for me that way.  After the movie we picked up Dru and drove to Kevin's camp, where we found a note on the door saying ""Don't turn on the lights"".  He's done this before.  It seems everytime we all go to his house or camp, he likes to sit in the dark by himself or with one or two people.  It's funny.  So we went and found ""Die die die"" messages on Katie's cell phone and an evil bear sitting in a high chair in the middle of the floor.  Kev and Steven are funny guys.  Not as good as the first time they did it, but that's okay.

And that's what we did.  Laura, Tyler, Erica and I hopped in Erica's car and drove.  Laura and I went mostly for the free pop I think haha.  We milked that free pop deal for all it was worth and paid for it by having to pee a lot. The food guy gave us free popcorn too...which we decided we would eat with free mayonnaise and ketchup....grossed Tyler out, but it was funny.  We got lots of free Wetnaps too.  What a free night.  A lot of good talks on the way there and back.  I like hanging with Laura and Tyler.  I like that their relationship is really open.  Tyler's wonderfully honest about everything, which I find great....not always the nicest thing, but it's really respectible.  And Laura can be herself around him, which makes me happy.  They are happy when they're togethter.  It's nice to see.  I always find going back from the states to be more intimidating than going into them.  The people are much less welcoming and very strict...and ask really pointless questions...or at least they seem that way.  What a good adventure that was.  I think on New Years, if I go to Cameron's, Laura and I are going to buy fancy drink glasses and go to the booze store and buy fancy drink stuff.  Either that or dinner party with Darin.

"event","Another weird dream last night...
There was a psychologist at my house and he was telling people they had mental illnesses...and I got really mad and one of my friends was there and I went crazy and started to beat her up and yell and scream.  Then...I guess she forgot that I did it, so we went to this college and saw Chelsea there...and Chelsea told us to go in this room that looked all sanitary and stuff...and we went inside and it was this weird animal testing place that looked like a bowling alley.  There were weird two dimensional plastic porcupines that were racing...and giant rats.  Chelsea wanted us to free all the rats.  There were too many needles and chemicals to free the rats though.  They were injecting all the animals there with weird things.  There were a bunch of weird dogs there too in cages.  Then we came out and Chelsea laughed at us.  Then we went home.

I guess that beats the dream I had a couple nights ago, where I worked in this secret office place, and my boss made me slaughter a cow that she stuck in my office by feeding it a lot of garbage.  Then I got scared that people would find out because of the cow poop smell.

My brother's friend Mary bought him an old school Ninja Turtles cartoon movie from the thrift store...I think I'm going to go see if he wants to watch it.

Merry Christmas kids.

Today was crap.  Family here today...all talking about death for 5 hours.  Everything related to Debbie and how she died.  Very depressing.  My old aunt likes to talk about death in any form.  I tried to get away by hiding in my room, but my other aunt came over and came upstairs to find me and brought be back downstairs to visit with more family that decided to come over and cram themselves into our tiny living room.  My 80 year old aunt was tanked.  I guess it's a hard time of year for everybody right now.  How about people stop driving drunk and killing other people...yeah...how about that.

Took a nap and managed to stay away from the cousins today...which is good.  Now I'm eating pickles."

"event","Okay..one more thing before I'm off to bed.  This is more of an observation.

I noticed something the last couple times I have been to Silvercity.  A while ago...maybe in the summer, they were advertising tickets for $7.95, with, I believe, no tax.  So in the fall, I looked in the paper and the prices had ""lowered"" to $6.79 (or something)...any movie, any time.  So one night I went to get my dad to pick up the ticket for a movie because he was going out...and I added everything up...put the tax on top of the price, since they were now charging tax on their tickets....it came out to something like $7.71.  I gave my dad the money, and he came home saying the ticket was more than $7.71.  This was no big deal...I paid him back the extra few cents.  Then...added up the ticket price again....$6.79 x 1.15 = $7.71...okay...so howcome the ticket price was $7.95.  We figured out they're charging something like 17% tax on ticket prices...can you even do that when taxes are normally 15%?  So...the ""cheaper"" prices are really the same as they were before. I need to look into this more.  Greedy bastards. 

Also...I find it really weird that people in the theatre applaud at the beginning when a person working there comes up to advertise Silvercity's products...I mean...we don't applaud when we see commercials on tv..."

"event","You notice when someone says, ""I'm here for you""...they're never actually there when you need them?  It's kind of something they say out of pity...or say because they can't think of anything else unoffensive to say.  They never mean it when they say they'll be there for you.  They won't be.  They are busy.  You don't cross their minds on a regular basis like they do in your mind.  They lie...they don't care. You're just a shadow.  

Last night the cover show was okay.  The bands were fun for the most part.  Some dressed up. Some of the people, I could have done without.  ""bla bla bla...-insert lame inside joke here- hahaha..."" *laughing hysterically in front of you*...""oh...we will never tell you what we're laughing about"".  You know..I didn't even care to know.  I don't care about your inside joke and I wasn't planning on trying to be a part of it since I don't even like your little group of friends.  I don't like that you try and fit in with the bands by buying new clothes that you think will make you more 'band worthy'...and do things that you think will make yourself popular with people that don't like you in the first place...the fact that you take pictures of people who hate you...countless pictures of the same band...I hate you.  I don't like that you try to be someone you're not and never will be.  I just want you all to go away (not you...the people i picture in my head as i write this).  You're nothing but useless groupies without the sex.  And most of all...I hate that they don't see it......just shut up.

Watched The Two Towers and The Fellowship today...not bad.  I think they're a little overrated to be quite honest.  They're still good...just don't quite live up to all the hype people give them, in my opinion.

Oh yeah...a year ago today...some drunk loser killed my pregnant cousin while he was driving.  Apparantly...he had something like 22 counts of child molestation or abuse or something like that too.  No driver's liscence...lots of drunken charges.  I hate him too.

Aren't I just a little bundle of happiness......gross."

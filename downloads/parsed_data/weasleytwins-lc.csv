"event","<p>The Twins were cleaning up shoppe after a particularly long day of visits from Hogwarts Students.&nbsp;&nbsp;George stacked misplaced jokes and gags&nbsp;in a basket, to give to Verity to replace on the shelves&nbsp;in the morning.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""The Twins have a chat about a certain 7th year"">""Is it just me or are they getting more annoying?"" asked Fred,&nbsp;sweeping the mess of Pigmy Puff droppings up off&nbsp; the floor around their pink cage.<br />""Hmm?"" asked George absentmindedly, stopping to turn with what looked to be a Fanged Frisbee in hand.<br />""The 3rd years. So annoying! Were we ever that <em>annoying</em> when we were in Hogwarts?"" asked Fred.<br />They both looked at eachother.<br />""Nahhh!"" they agreed simultaneously with wide smiles.<br /><br />""We weren't annoying, rather, we were...."" George thought for a moment,&nbsp;fanning the Frisbee back and forth, ""<em>Charming</em>!""<br />They both laughed and continued working.<br /><br />Fred threw the little blue and yellow droppings into a nearby bin and looked thoughtful. ""Hey, have you seen that girl around here from Hogwarts? The one with the ginger hair? About our height I guess....""&nbsp;<br /><br />George looked clueless, shook his head and continued to work. Fred wasn't satisfed with his vacant expression and persisted.<br /><br />""The girl with the ginger hair!"" said Fred, annoyed that George had no idea who he could be talking about.<br /><br />George returned the irritated tone with his own look and said, ""You mean Ginny?"" he chuckled.<br /><br />""NO! She's...a Hufflepuff I think. A 7th Year. She comes into the shoppe often,"" said Fred.<br /><br />""Was she in here today?"" asked George.<br /><br />""No. She wasn't."" said Fred. He surprised himself with the disappointment in his own voice.&nbsp;<br />George caught on and laughed,""Seems like somebody fancies Megan Jones!""<br /><br />""How'd you know her name?!"" asked Fred with great interest.&nbsp;<br />""Come off it, mate, she's in here every chance she gets. 'Cept for today. She stares at you, ya know,"" egged George, ""She was behind the shelves staring at ya last Hogsmeade visit.""<br /><br />Fred looked utterly pleased at this news. He turned a bit ginger himself and just smiled and continued to clean up around the Shoppe.<br /><br /><br />((ooc: this is simply to let the Megan Jones character know that Fred possibly fancies her, and to open up communication between the two characters possibly in the future?))<br /></div>"

"event","So long story short, I almost broke up with my girlfriend today for real. I don't know what I was thinking... She's such a great girl, I don't deserve to be with someone as good as her. She makes me so happy and It never fully hit me untill today. I don't know if she'll ever truly forgive me for being such a low life, but I was just so glad to have her in my arms again tonight. We met up at Juanita Beach, and before we said anything, and ran up and kissed her. But we covered a lot of ground, and I think we will be going on 5 months now strong! Well, that's all I want to say about that, so I guess I'm gonna go to bed."

"event","ok, so I haven't been able to use my computer for two reasons, a)I work a lot of hours, 2) My keyboard keeps messing up on me. I think that I should just go back to the old wired keyboard. I don't know, it's a big step. So, I went to Mr Cues again, and it was pretty cool. I'm not good at pool, but I'm not bad at pool you know? I just go there to have fun, and make my lucky shots. so other than work, that's all I got."

"event","I was unsure about doing all this, but my girlfriend Ray finally convinced me. Mainly because her friend Spam has this sweet RP, so I was pretty excited. Let's see, I think you write about what you're doing with your day in these things... So I'm going to Shoreline today to get my parking pass and hopefully take care of the money situation for books and tuition. What might end up happeing is something like ""Yeah, you should just go home and never come here again."" After that, I'm probably going to have lunch with an old friend, Irene! She's just going through her run of bad luck right now, so I'm just trying to be there as much as I can for her. From like 10-2 in the morning, I was playing pool with my brother Matt at Dr. Cues. It's pretty cool except for all the cig smoke... Anyways, Irene called me last night and I was like ""whoa! how ya doing?"" and she just wanted to stay out and say hi to her ""kid"". So yeah, I don't know what else to say, so leave me a message or something. Oh yeah, I know my profile looks like shit, so don't remind me. I'm working on fixing it!"

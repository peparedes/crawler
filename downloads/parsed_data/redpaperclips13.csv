"event","i've been questioning myself a lot this week. i get depressed and then get more depressed that i'm depresesed. does that make any sense?? yea.. i'm back to ana. it's a really really really long story about my ed. basically i've been going through it for a really long time, and recently for some reason my 'dedication' if you can call it that, has been majorly faltering. like REALLY badly. and when i have a bad day, i cut myself.. which is depressing in itself. this week i've cut myself 4 times.. i feel like it's necessary to do when i'm not good. like, punishing myself or something. thing is, it's my own little secret. no body knows about what i'm going through except myself...it sucks massively. but at the same time it's good. it gives me modivation to 'be good'.
so in conclusion: I AM BACK.
love,
kate"

1 chewy granola bar
1 piece of toast with margarine and cinnamon
1 teaspoon of chocolate frosting (hehe..)
1/2 cookie

that's it- it was kind of a lot, but what's good is that i got really full after eating some of that.

"event","so inspiration. i'm going to make a list of reasons why i can't eat like i just did. 
i might as well be constructive with the time i can't sleep, right?

REASONS WHY KATIE SHOULDNT EAT:
1) I'll feel crappy and fat like I do now (if I eat).
2) I'll LOOK crappy and fat like I do now (if I eat).
3) I have people counting on me to lose weight.
4) My family will stop giving me shit about being 'chubbier' than my cousin.
5) I'll look better for my boyfriend.
6) When I go to Boston this December I'll be thinner.
7) Food=gross
8) I'll improve my self control and dicipline, which I desperately need to do.
9) I'll overcome the power that food has over my life.
10) Eat to live, don't live to eat.
11) If I eat, I'll have to cut myself, which damages my skin, and people will notice.



I made these really cool bracelets out of righteous beads I found at Michaels yesterday. 
I think I'll always wear them. They work as a constant reminder of a goal I'm trying to reach.

"event","well i saw wallace and gromit today with a friend. he wants to be more than a friend, and i really don't like him that way. different guy than before. but ya, the movie was grreatly hysterical! sad thing is, he got us a small popcorn, and i ate a few handfulls. sweet, buttered, salty, popcorn. i can't believe i did that. so when i got home i ate an apple and drank a bottle of water. something good for me to cancel out the crap, maybe? aaah, i'm so mad. tonight my friend is coming over and we're watching a movie and making cookies. i don't want to eat ANY of it, but i don't want to make her suspicious. i hate when this happens. WHAT DO I DO?? i loved chocolate chip cookies too.
i'll keep you updated.

i have a date tonight! i'm kind of excited. except i don't really know if i like this guy enough to be his g/f. haha, he thinks we're going out, but i just don't know.
and there's this other guy i'm supposed to go to a movie with on saturday, and he is probablly going to ask me out, cuz we went to homecoming together as friends. aaah i'm so confused!!
today so far:
2 bottles of water
1 piece of toasted bread with jam on it

not too bad, lets see if i can get by without eating much on this 'date' thingy.

usually when people are all eating around me, i give in and eat too. but this time, i didn't! and no candy either! i know it's stupid to be so proud of such a little thing, but i guess for me it was a big accomplishment.
ok well... i gotta go.

i went to a friends house today with some friends and we watched the ring and the grudge. they had chips, and popcorn, and candy, and hot dogs. i ate like all their cucumbers. aaaah! i came home and watched final destination 2 with my dad and brother. 3 creepy movies in a row dude- that'll do enough to paranoy you for a few weeks... lol.

"event","Hey there all-
i'm new at this. i don't think anyone will actually be reading these entries.. they're mostly for my own benefit. i have real journals and stuff i write in at home, but it just seems easier to have one on the computer for some reason.
dude, i'm so fucked up. like seriously.. i don't know what the hell's wrong with me. i know i'm not alone, and a lot of people feel the same way i do, but it's just so hard to talk about it. last time i tried to talk about my 'problems' or whatever to someone, they laughed and thought i was joking, or got really mad at me.

here's a little bit about me:
-I LOVE music. I live for it. I've been singing in choirs since i was little, and it gives me a lot of joy. my big thing.
-I've moved 10 times.. but that's not important.  
-I have three younger brothers, and am the only girl on my moms side of the family.
-We have about 20 barn cats that keep multiplying.
-I don't have very many real friends.
    -I have no friends who i can talk to about how i feel..
-My family doesn't understand my feelings.
-My mom thinks she's a counsoler.
-I've cut myself for 2 years now.
    -People found out about it, brushed it aside, and my parents grounded me.. i stopped for awhile, and then just recently started up again.
-Tons of people count on me to be stable, and come to me with advice.
    -I'm not stable, and give crappy advice.
-I hate the way i look.
-If i don't talk about it, no one will know.

So there you go.. there's me for you. 

Until next time!
XxKate

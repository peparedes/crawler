this site and reading everyone's things has felt too daunting a project to undertake and sift through. i hope everyone who reads this is well, please please let me know if i have missed anything about anyone, and feel free to contact me through email/aim if one should wish to for any reason.

"event","i dont understand cruelty. especially cruelty to a person who is hurting. to a person who you claim to love, were in-love with. how does one allow himself to become such a monster? how can a person keep themselves from caring for another human being, scream at them and call them names, put them down like they are going through nothing? how can one not understand the hurt the person they have told they do not love is now going through? how would you expect a person to act whos heart is being broken? not everyone can shove it out of their minds. forget. deny. convince themselves of so many things, when they were convinced otherwise for so long. its not healthy to do that. sure, its dealing, but its temporary, and actually, its not dealing. if you can feel so confident in a decision, you should be able to face it. face the person who you said you loved, who was the one, who you planned such a future with. take responsibility and be mature. understand that this person is facing a difficult time and not condem her for feelings and actions that any spurned lover would have and make. face and discuss, make closure and come to terms, as a pair, because it was not just you in the relationship, even if it is just you who made a choice. have some compassion. do not put up walls. do not run away. do not revert to old ways. its not right, though it may work for you now. and it is terrible, awful, heartless, to the person who said you loved.

and im sorry, but no one could ever truely be 100% sure of something like this, as you claim ""not one teeny tiny part of me wants to be with you"". if you dont hear your heart at all, you arent listening to it. how could one ever be so sure of matters dealing with love and the heart, something that meant so much only two weeks ago? the very act of stating such an impossibility shows an error in thinking, cloudiness. something is not being allowed to surface, not being allowed to be considered, not being allowed to be felt. and that is not healthy, not fair, and hurtful to you and to me.

all of the truth, not just what you choose to see, will come down on you, that i know. though i struggle with self-doubt at times, i know i am a good, caring, selfless, honest, person... and stronger than i thought. but what does what you are doing make you out to be? it surely shows who is capable of dealing, who is strong and who is weak, when i face and i deal and i work on myself, and you run away and hide, distract and alienate yourself, and talk with no one but biased parties.

i know the best will come of the situation, but i cant help but think it will come sooner to one who has open eyes not afraid of crying, an open mind that considers everything, and a true heart that is allowed to speak up and be heard, even if only to be broken."

"event","i can tell myself everything will be ok all day long, and believe it. but the fact is my heart is broken. and no place that i move, or thing i accomplish, or amount of fun i have, will make that pain dissipate. 

i dont understand how this happens. i dont understand how people let themselves give up. i mean, i do, but i dont. i do. but i dont know. D isnt the kind of person who gets carried away with something, hes incredibly controled. and honest. he does what he wants and nothing else. and he's logical and has a lot of sense about himself, and life; hes got a good head on his shoulders, that is always the ruling force with him. thats one reason why i dont understand why he now doubts things he did or thought in our relationship. it would be so unlike him to do anything by any other force than that of his own will. he might have ""lost himself"" to the degree one needs to in order to be in love, but he always knew what he was doing. he always knew, and i believe he believed in us. i believe his wanted what he said he did. 

he needs independance higher than what you have when you share yourself with someone. i guess he needs to reclaim himself. he has always done what he wants, but i guess my existing in the backround limited him. it sort of seems as if he doesnt want to care about me, i mean, the way he talks about it is that he doesnt like the feeling of wanting to be there for someone. he is trying to help me find a place to move, and i tell him, ""see i thought you wanted me to do things for myself"" (as if dont already), and he says, this is what i want to stop doing, stop helping you. whats wrong with helping someone??? it just means that you care! and whats wrong with caring for someone? thats a good thing!! why should someone suppress or try to get rid of such a feeling? why would someone want to not care? i dont know. its something about this i dont understand. i do soooooo much for myself. i dont need help, and i cant find a place, and go to utilities and do all this stuff for myself, its not hard and its not what im scared of. its that he doesnt want to care ""too much""(!), thats something im scared of, something im so confused by.

other than the overwhelming pain, i guess im getting better at dealing with this. its hard to keep it all in, try not to think about it. im trying to give him what he wants, space. leaving him alone. not talking, not asking questions. i feel like im trying to be invisible, too scared to ask, care, effect him at all, since thats what i understand to be what he wants, to be uneffected."

"event","<lj-cut text=""i am more than this"">though no doubt much to my own fault, most people i know seem to have a perception of me that is not entire. everyone seems to think im miserable all of the time, though i can remember countless times of fun and happiness. i dont understand this dispairity, but people have expressed this view to me and it makes me realize i havent opened myself up very much, a thing which is not easy to do. i feel as if no one really knows me, or they are just arent acknowledging everything else i know i am and know i demonstrate. ""melissa-ann"" does not mean ""depressionandanxiety"", it means ""melissa-ann"". i am not those things, they are a bad part of me, a hormone, a habit learned from parents, ingrained thoughts, whatever, the point is they are not me, they are not my dreams, not what i want, not how i truely feel. there have been times when these impulses have been so strong, i have felt as if i truely believed them, and stated that; it is a cloud, its a phantom, a bad apple, and it is something that i have had no choice in possessing, and it expresses itself. it is like a spirit possessing me, making me think and see in its twisted way.

but nevertheless, no one claims to have seen the real me. Dustin used to say he had, and he knew that the depression was not me, and that i could overcome it, and he knew i did not want to be this way. i cant help but feel so defensive. i cant stand to hear people say im miserable allllll of the time when i know the truth, and i know they see the truth that i am not, but they say this anyway. I DO NOT DENY MY PROBLEMS, and never, ever have. i do not deny my part in this relationship, and my part in what brought it to whatever state it is in. 

i cannot change the way he thinks. i cannot open his mind. i cannot make him look at things. i cannot persuade him to drop his defenses, his wall he has built to detach and distance himself. i cant do these things any more than he could persuade me that i should forget everything positive, or that it should be easy to push all these feelings aside. this is just the way it is. he is not wrong in the way he is seeing, even if i dont think he sees everything. and he is right in so many ways, even if i dont think this is what should happen.

and its strange, and sort of bittersweet, that a time that demands of me so much strength to not shatter makes me see how strong i have become. how aware i really am of my abilities and the work i do on myself that no one sees but me, and the limits i have and how, though i have known it for some time, i do need to swallow my fears and talk to someone professional. and the person i have talked to, and will see in the future, she is able to see these things. its so hard to talk about problems i have to friends or people, because i am scared of scaring people away or burdening them somehow, so people dont know what is going on inside of me, might not know how to understand, and so they have perceptions (as everyone makes, it is out of their control), that are effects without a cause, without a full picture. its nice to talk to someone who knows how these problems can take over people, and how they are not something unconquerable, someone who doesnt think im just crazy and hopeless, someone else who knows i am a person and i am good and i can live and have things and be happy."

"event","<lj-cut text=""how do you make love stay?"">Dustin doesnt want to be with me anymore. he wont hear reason, hes incredibly negative. he isnt taking the entirety of our relationship into consideration. he says its been coming but he didnt know that, feel it, or see it. he says he doesnt think ill ever get better. he says all these things about me putting presure on him, that arent true at all. i never ask anything of him. i never expect anything of him. i know that he isnt supposed to help me, and he doesnt do anything to help me, so i dont know why he thinks that he is supposed to. he takes all these things upon himself that im not placing there, and now i suffer. he wont see how ive gotten better. he wont see anything positive at all. hes so stubborn. he just wants to quit because its easy. because he went to a weekend thing that made him want to be more independant. i dont keep him from doing anything. i would never stop him from doing anything he wants to do, ever. he is independant. i am independant, though he says im not, which isnt true. i do ao much for myself. i chose to go to school. i chose to learn how to drive. i made those decisions of my own volition. i live my day with myself, taking care of myself. but he says he feels like he has to take care of me. he doesnt do anything!!! i dont know why he feels that, he doesnt do anything. he says im miserable all the time and its not true. he just wont even think about good days, about the good past. ""its the negative things that brought me to this conclusion"" he says. but youre not supposed to make conclusions with only one side of the situation!! with only half the story! he wont hear this from me. hes closed himself off from me. even if there is some way to remedy this, he doesnt think he wants to, because its ""risky"". oh, fuck, if no one did anything risky in life. i was being risky by getting in a relationship. its risky getting in the damn car. ""risky""ness shouldnt keep you from doing things where the gain is sooooo much greater than the risk. he used to believe in us. he is the one who talks about getting married, and he is the one that gave me a ring only last month. only last month!!! hes the one who talks about buying land together. i dont trap him. i dont try to take away any part of him. he wont listen to me. he doesnt listen. he admits he is confused but hes so determined to be negative that i know he isnt fully considering everything. i didnt know there was all of this wrong. he didnt know either. its not right that we should just give up. its not right to quit. if hes scared thats ok, but he doesnt say it that way. he says he doesnt know if he ""can"". he doesnt know if he wants to try. him and i were so invested. i didnt make him!!! i didnt change him! we are two independant people! i dont know why he could just give up like this. i dont know why he doesnt see any hope for us, something he was soooo sure of. i dont know why he cant see the potential he used to see. i dont know how i can stop seeing it. i dont know how i can let go of the future that was so sure and the love that is so solid i have no doubt in my mind that it was going to be. i love him so much. he is such a great person and what we are supposed to have was so beautiful. and he wont see it, he doesnt even try. he is dead set. hes making a rash decision, on one side of things. no relationship is without its ups and downs. no relationship can be anything without effort. and now that weve come to the apex of a supposedly gathering problem, we should face it and do what we need to work though it. but no. he doesnt see it that way. its too much. he doesnt want to work. he wants to be free. he has always been free. if he feels that isnt true, then it is because of presures he imposed upon himself. marraige. ""taking care of me"" i dont know what the heck he does to that end. i never asked him to ""take care of me"". hes not my damn shrink. i dont expect him to be. he has always been free. he has grown, i have not impeded anything that he wants to do or any way he wants to change or grow. he does what he wants, goes where he wants, eats what he wants. sometimes ive gotten upset because he has spent more time doing political things and we talked about that when i felt that way, and came to the conclusion that there was an acceptible balance between these things. i dont stop him. for now we are sleeping in separate rooms, and it is killing me. i love him so much. his emotions never, ever, ever come out, and its so hard to know they are truely there. i dont understand how love cannot be enough strength and power and reason to try to fix whatever is wrong. i guess right now nothing is definate, but hes so negative, and refuses to see positive, that i feel i know where it will end. im not mad, because i cannot be. hes not wrong, but i dont think he is going about things correctly, holistically. hes giving up. he doesnt see all the positive changes i have made in myself. they dont matter because they ""cant change the past"". thats not what it is about!! its about making the future better. its about believing and faith and love. with every bit of my body i believe in our love and future. he did too. its so out of character for him to be negative. for him to not have hope. if communcation is an issue, then we know that now, and it has been because we have been busy, both of us. that is not abnormal of a problem to have, its a time every relationship goes through. i think this is all about communication. the things he says were not clear to him until now, were not clear to either of us. and if they went on for as long as he says, we did not know. he isnt even clear on if/when these things/feelings happened. how can a problem so unclear be allowed to take over the fate of our relationship?? we should not hurt what we have just because we did not see that something that accumulated. in any relationship, things accumulate, and they get to a point where you figure out how to better the situation. you dont just QUIT. you dont just give up on everything. i cant get him to see this. i cant get him to see anything. i am totally powerless in this. he is determined to see only the negative, and to be negative about it. i dont know what to do. i dont know what to think about this. i just wish he would understand how he doesnt need to feel these pressures. i just wish he would let himself feel all of the good things that he is denying. i just wish he would believe me when i say how our future would be so great, so loving, so fantastic and full of growth and experience and yes it would not be easy but nothing worth having is easy. nothing worth having isnt worth fighting and working towards. we have something. i dont want him to just give up on it because of his perceptions or his own mental issues of needing to help others and thinking he has taken it too far or whatever because i dont need him for my mental health. he used to say he needed to help me. it was his purpose. i know that it isnt up to him and ive never said that or lead him to believe that it was. it isnt right that he shouldnt see the truths to his perceptions. he is ignoring a whole world of fact and feeling. because its not easy. because its risky. im at risk too!!! i didnt even want a relationship because i was scared. and there were times when i said i wanted to back out, and it was only easy because i only thought about the negative things in my head. i  didnt think about what was possible. he isnt,either. he isnt considering for once second anything positive, or that anything can be done. this isnt the worst situation or problem that a relationship has had, im sure that many have bee n through much much worse. i need to work on me, he has time to work on the things he has. when we are together we are we, and those things may be subjects of talk, but they are our own things. i wish i could get him to see that i understand, and  that the changes in communcation are not difficult to fix. that i can work harder on me, and that he can feel free to pursue those things that he is already free to pursue. i wish i could lift those burdens he has placed on himself. i wish he could open his mind up. all i can do is wait for the axe to fall right now, the relationship is in his hands.  im powerless for it. i dont know what is going on in his head, but i just hope that he can consider every factor of our relationship, the positive things and potential, besides the fact that we have had stress lately of our own outside factors does not mean that things will always be like this. there have been so many changes during our relationship, there has hardly been any length of time where the factors or each of our lives have not changed in some way. we need to work on things. we have not been. that does not mean there is no hope, no future. i dont know why he will not open his mind. i cant stop typing. its just so frustrating, because he wont hear me, i cant only say what i wish he would listen to to other people, becayse when i say it to him, it bounces off, he refuses to acknowledge anything i say, or really consider it. i cant beliueve i have no power of input in a relationship i am one half of, but it is true. he has taken all of the power. he has taken all of it.</lj-cut>"

im cutting excess from my flist so if i dont read things for a few days i dont have some daunting 13 pages of the crap/people that are interesting but i never comment so its just like reading a TV show/etc i have now. and there might be people who never post and im going to cut them while im at it, so stand up if you think youre one of those. i doubt ill make ""friends only"" entries, so i guess youll see my entries even if i take you off. if anyone even reads this thing.

or so i hope. it might be the weather. its sunny and bright and mild outside. these swings of temperature and the swings of my temperment accordingly give me great reason to blame SAD for my snowy lows (as if i dont have them all year... but D states i am worse this time of year). but the climate outside is about as unpredictable as of late as my state and i am throughout all the seasons.

and i continue to exist, like everyone else is so content to 
but im just not


ive never been one. a big fan of getting a job and being a voter and having a car. and i still have incredible anxiety about job searches (ok, so do most i would imagine) and ive only voted once in my 7 years of ability to do so (for a person who i sort of knew, otherwise i wouldnt have even done it) and now that i can drive i completely hate it. i think i knew it would be like this from a very early age, that i would hate it, or maybe i decided that at the very beginning, but either way im not predisposed for the standard way of life. it just doesnt fit right, or i dont know how to wear it. as a child i dreamed of the things i would be, the way i wanted to live, and im sure it would have made adults laugh if i had actually communicated my true thoughts and feeling to an adult, ever, in my youth. 

one dream i had was that i wanted to find the next big archeological site in Egypt. the news that this has happened without my involvement is a big blow to my psyche. not only has my dream been fullfilled by others, but i am in no fucking way close to doing ANYTHING AT ALL EXTRODINARY OR INTERESTING OR ACCOMPLISHING AAAAAANYTHING in my life. now, i never really got my hopes up too high about digs and statues or anything else that i have dreamed about, but i didnt know that i would have done absolutely nothing by my age. i thought id do <i>something</i>... but no. im just doing what everyone else does. 

i dont think ""what everyone else does"" is bad, and im not saying that im better than that, because believe me, im not better than anything. but i dont know. im just upset. i dont know what the hell im doing. im doing nothing, i want to do something, but i dont i cant im wound and im broken and im a mechanical pencil with no lead, purpose obvious and will present but no way to convey, so is there any purpose anymore? or ever?

goddamn. my psych teacher was saying today that there are some people with higher IQs that dont reach thier potential because of mental disorder. all i could think about is how creative mentally disordered types turn to the bottle to disolve their problems, temporarily, sometimes, or something else. its like the ladder up the wall, like the hole under the fence, the ""open sesame"" into the cave of ideas and thought. its stereotypical, i know. but thats what i was thinking when she said it. i just wonder what other ways there are over that wall, under that fence, cause im just sitting here staring at it and i cant seem to think my way through."

"event","I've lost my voice, and i love it.

For some reason, being ""sick"" for me almost always includes this affliction. There have been instances where laryngitis was the <i>only</i> symptom i had, and  besides that i felt perfectly normal. On these occasions my friends Ken and Dave would swoon all about, because they said i had ""the sexy voice"", and even though it might hurt a bit for me to vocalize, their goofy, amorous behavior towards me only made me want to talk more. 

Having no voice makes me feel vulnerable, so it sort of makes me feel strange to like it all the same. I like the way that being any kind of physically sick makes me feel more helpless or needy, too. Im reminded of princesses in towers, that feminine quality of distress and frailty. It all reminds me of a program i once watched on human sexuality. Though im not one to talk up the subject, when its spelled out like a science its fascinating. Which sort of explains the reason for the ""princess syndrome"": sitting around being sensitive and defenseless, naive and clean, detached and dreamy, is a whole lot easier on the conscious. Now im not saying that when im sick and have lost my voice that im looking to get some, im just saying that being in this sort of emotional/physical state makes me feel a certain sort of femininity that i enjoy revelling in. 

No wonder i dont connect with feminism... 




Anyway. I havent been writing, because ive been hectic. And notice im trying to capitalize things. Though MS Word automatically capitalized things you write, im trying to learn to remember myself. You know, for all those tons of papers im going to have to write now that im a student again. 

I almost completely changed my schedule for school. I dont remember if i posted it before, but i was taking Intro Psych, Intro Soc, Intro Phil, and Eng 101. Im still pissed about the fact that Eng 101 is mandatory. BUT, while changing my schedule i was advised to take a selective ""Eng 104"" course in the fall, which is 101/102 in one semester, with a challenging, enjoyable, quality professor, that i was assured i would be accepted into. So that is the plan for that. And now i am taking Intro Phil, Intro Psych (the only original class in its original time slot), World Civ I, and Intro to Classical Music. I wanted more than these 12 credits, but was warned against getting over my head in my first semester of school in so long. Sadly, it looks unlikely i will get in over my <i>knees</i> from what my syllabi look like. My teachers (all of whom are likable) like to lecture, and i like to read and listen, but i wont be doing much writing. Ive taken all of these things already in high school and have a memory of them, except for the music course, which looks to be my savior for actually learning something this semester.

And yesterday i tried to quit the farm, but im no good at quitting when someone wont let me. I told my boss i wasnt getting enough hours and i need to leave, needed to find something steady and dependable. He counter-offered with a salary. Not a killer one, nor one that i couldnt top if i were lucky enough find something fleible with longer hours and decent pay, but it was a solution to my problem, somewhat, so i couldnt really refuse, and i dont know how to say ""no"" or ""give me more"". Im still iffy on the whole thing. Ive got a lot of personal issues with him/his son/the industry, but more important than these issues right now is my own financial situation. So i guess ive got to accept it for now. But there are kinks to be ironed out, and i though it seems like sort of a bad idea, i want to make it clear that im not going to stop looking for a job with more hours/pay. I think he thinks i cant get better (hes a dick), but im pretty sure i could... somehow. I would feel sort of bad if i left, but not really. I would only feel bad in that ""youll never have anyone as good as me/ no one will treat you like i do"" type of way, but i know i would be better off in the long run.

they can fall and hurt themselves in your apartment. youre liable.
my friends arent jerks, they know what constitutes an accident. and how are they getting hurt, anyway?
they could trip over something. they could drive home too drunk.
*laughing and swearing in head* i dont have people driving home drunk from my house! i dont even really have people drinking at my house!

i think im going to dig out my dad's old violin and teach myself to do something with it. i had a dream i was in an awesome jug band type outfit and i was rockin' a fiddle like it was my job. i know a violin isnt a fiddle, but its a start, and i practically have one, which is more than i can say for my first instrument of choice.

the other night D and i had a get-together at our house for new years. a boardgame party. my stomach was doing backflips for three days in an attempt to force me into oncoming traffic so as to avoid the upcoming social event that was the first ever party-type-thing ive ever held/hosted. D is funny 'cause he said to me that i should be able to relax at the fact that i was going to be safe in my own home, instead of being a visitor in a foreign place. it doesnt really work that way. instead of being a speck (unimportant and a nusance) in a maze (strange, lost, intrusion), the flipside is like being under glass, a microscope of a stage. so i always wanted to run off, find some other focus, the naked person in the crowd, the back doors of the theater that we were taught in dance class to focus on while we spun and performed. i guess/hope in the end i was alright and not too awkward. i drank a half a bottle of rum with (soy) eggnog, and i like rum-drunk, though i was never more than just there, which was enough. it was a really good time, id like people to come over more often.

and i guess that happening is a bit more probable, or more comfortable an idea that previously looked upon as, since our housemate is moving out. yes, we have a housemate. he's about as conspicuous in our lives as he is in this journal, which is to say he is a exclusive to himself and his computer monitor. well, i cant say i know much about his life, honestly. he and D were friends for a year before i came around and theyve grown apart to the point where a biting resentment has developed. the air in the apartment has been thick with tension for some time. its a sad situation. but ive been given cold, hard encouragment and foundation so as to quit the farm. which i dont really want to do, but the business aspect is making me a bit ill, and im seriously underappreciated/underpaid (and the whole ""giving me an animal"" thing is a complete ruse, and a stupid thing for them to try and pull). and a new room = more room for tchotchkes and decorating. actually, now we have really complete control over EVERYTHING. this place is going to be so different... so much warmer. im not opposed to someone else moving in eventually, but it will be nice to have some more space."

no, ive never seen that movie, but i can only hope the no doubt rollicking, drunken, co-ed fun held within it will be found in my own upcoming return to the lively world of higher education. ok, my <i>debut</i>.. but its not as if im going to be living in a dorm, living off of whatever i can cook on a hot plate, or any of those other obligatory college things, so my experience has already been plotted out as one different from the freshly-out-of-high-school-like-most-people, since its been almost six long-short years since i failed gym class and vowed to show the world i didnt need a diploma or formal education.

and i dont feel as if ive failed to show that, 'cause i know no ""one"" cared anyway. it was more than young, anti-establishmentarianism; other factors like being unsure, complex, or obscure in my view of what i ""wanted to be"", and me and my family not having money (and me not wanting to pay off loans my entire life [a                thought which co-exists with other ""idealistic"" views and problems i have with the way EVERYTHING is]). anyway, i guess ive settled down or supressed something or whatever. ha, i had much more energy for writing about this in the beginning. im pretty tired lately. got 10 hours of sleep and ive only been awake 13 hours and im done. D made fries, theyre calling.

my schedule for spring: oh hell i forgot the hours. im taking Sociology, Intro to Psych, Intro to Philosophy, and whatever they call English 101, which you HAVE to take, and i think is silly, since the woman who helped me register for my classes acted as if she could obviously tell from my APT test that 101 is going to be a total snore-fest for me.

D and i went grocery shopping and ""film""-seeing/tea-drinking with Joe and Nikki. saw <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0367089/"">The Squid and the Whale</a>, which  i really, really enjoyed, when i wasnt covering my eyes and face flushed with discomfort for certain.. situations held within it. really, i liked it. the more i think about it, i think id like to own it someday. and thats a lot to say about a film.  it was pretty accurate in its portrayal of the average divorcee's behavior towards their children, i felt (compared to my own parents, anyway). it was also pretty funny in its representation of the ""intellectual"" characters. and any movie using Kafka as a factor in a joke line definitely wins points with me. all in all, Jeff Daniels has never looked so hot (and it wasnt just the beard, it was the fact that he was such a smug, intellectual, sad snob).

Sunday we went to the symphony holiday show with D and his family. it was very enjoyable. i love watching orchestras, even though it makes my fingers ache for a cello's strings to be underneath them again. a Jewish cantor came out and sang a beautiful song in Hebrew. they played songs from the ""Home Alone"" score (ok, cheesy in idea, sort of, but its actually pretty nice music, i mean, they played that song that they use for the morning where Kevin's mom comes home and theyre reunited and AWWWW, etc, and i sort of got tears in my eyes, its very pretty. ok, i guess im a wuss, fuck you all, i love that movie, FUCK YOU). they also played what D calls ""the Home Alone song"", which is actually ""Trepak (Russian Dance)"" from the Nutcracker Suite (which i have always known, because i goddamn love the Nutcracker and as a ballet student i went and saw it every damn year). the maestro said he tried to put together a show of less-played seasonal music, and they did play a Rimsky-Korsakov piece and some British thing. oh and traditional Rudolph and Frosty, which i could have done without (as i said to D, if i wanted to see people sing those i could go to an elementary school's christmas show), because i hate sitting around incredible joyous people singing that crap while i just want to hear some quality orchestral music. humbug!


and today i continued my pretend adulthood by taking the placement test at the local community college. oh yeah. even though i forgot a whoooole lot of my maths, i still got past ""math 98"" or whatever the hell it is. i didnt worry about anything else, and it was all easy... except the maths. anyway, now i have to schedule a whole bunch of classes i dont want to take, so i can get good grades and transfer ASAP to a school ill actually want to tell people i go to.

they are everything that i want to be, and yet, cars i never see coming keep running me over.



and though that was meant to be something of a pun, i seriously cry <i>every single time</i> i see a little fuzzy (or anything that once lived) that has lost its life in the middle of the road (i think ive already expressed in this journal my intense hatred for those who shrug off such actions and occurances). it fucking ruins me. ive stayed home instead of going to social functions out of incurred saddness, im not kidding. because when people start seeing even such ""small"" deaths as something that ""just happens"" or ""is no big deal"" (these are imaginary quotes, mind you, but i can hear people saying them), then i know that the human race has really lost its sense of worldliness, a piece of love that no one has for things outside their immediate, self-serving sphere. oh hell, i think i knew that years ago. i just have this ""i won't stay in a world without love"" sort of additude about it. come to think of it, i think that sort of feeling is the root of most of my depression.

hmm.


so, squirrels. i love them. no one ever thinks about how many die. i always get scared that they could slowly go extinct, and no one would even notice. they'd all be happy their suet wasnt being eaten and they wouldnt have to buy fancy $60 birdfeeders that throw squirrels off of them. but that little dot, that bouncing little grey (or red, or black around these parts) fluff would be missing from the yard. no yard is complete without one, and it hurts me to see bare stretches of perfectly cut emerald grass, unmarred, unscavenged. we need the squirrel. to make us laugh, to prevent millions of saplings, to just be there, be jittery and to complete our world.

i dont get why everyone thinks im ""wrong"" and ""stupid"" for not liking my appearance. its not like i go around telling people ""im ugly"", but if the subject of my looks comes up i gotta be honest about what i think. and then everyone tells me im crazy. well, i dont think anyone tells their friend they are ugly, do they? of course not. so why do i have to believe anything anyone else says, anyway? 

i dont share everyone's opinion, so leave off about it. its not even a big deal! i dont sit home crying about it (often), so lets just drop it and never bring it up again. there's more importaint things that i should be thinking about than my looks, and im trying very hard to do so, and people telling me im wrong doesnt do anything but make me think about what i really see myself as. i appreciate that complements are supposed to make me feel good, but they only make me awkward, and being my friend is enough to make me feel good. so dont tell me im wrong, pretty, crazy, anything, unless you want to deal with a heaping can of worms, alright? ok.

its the only thing on my mind and im trying so hard to supress it and destract myself but when i open my mouth or my mind its the only thing i can say or think about.
and im falling apart in little bits but it doesnt relieve the pressure to just fall on the ground and get into a ball and think about all the ways in which it is awful and punch at the dirt and why is it that death always makes life stand out so much? why when something is dying does it seem to feel more warm and more solid and more conscious even when its losing it?

damn. i love The Monkees. even that pansy Davey. he may be a poor-man's Paul McCartney, but at least he's not a total and complete tool who went on to make shitty music for years and years after his band broke up. Paul sucks. i would like to see a boxing match between Davey and Paul. hell, throw in Peter Noone for kicks. maybe Eric Burdon. but no Brian Wilson, he'd fucking tear the place apart.

"event","today i quit a job at a Starbucks that i hadnt even started yet, and scheduled an interview at a coffee place in a mall. im serious. let me put the difference this way: 

Starbucks = wearing a fucking headset, due to its location and drive-through-ness, its basically going to be a slight notch up from working at Dunkin Donuts. a teeny, tiny, slight notch. the woman who ""interviewed"" me (ie, told me when to come in and fill out tax crap) looked at my resume and said ""oh, so it looks like you have some food service experience"" flippantly. <i>some</i> experience??? working with coffee is almost all ive done since i was 18. i spent 4 years in one place and became assistant goddamn manager. SOME experience??? fuck them. the other people there for interviews were some juvenile delinquents and i think THEY got hired. Starbucks is some bullshit, i didnt want to work there in the first place, its just that its 5 min from my house and i need to do <i>something</i>..

mall coffee place = no drive through. thats enough to swing me. plus, as funny as it sounds, i kind liked working in a mall. i love being busy. i love assholes that piss me off. i love tips. i love that this place isnt going to make me go to ""Espresso College"" or whatever the hell Starbucks calls its mandatory training program they do (even though ive got over 7 years combined experience, id still have to go). i spoke with the manager who asked if i had experience and i told her all the crap ive done and she said ""so you know how to do all this stuff already!"" and so there i go, im not going to be treated like some fucking nothing like i would at Starbucks. fuck, i cant believe i was almost going to work there... anyway, the mall is seasonal anyway, which is ideal. 

sure, people think making coffee is a shit job. sort of is. but its not. and i love it, i dont even care if it is shit. its a goddamn art. its a small art, but it satisfies people. i dont know, i like that. its something i know im wicked good at, and even if normal people take it for granted, i feel proud. i should move to Italy where i would be more respected...



in other news, i love Metallica."

"event","tonight, after working up the courage for weeks (ay! months) to ask, and facing numerous set-backs (or at least ""sit-back... and see what the hell is going on now""s) in influential developments, i finally talked to my boss about getting a raise. and he fucking <i>filibustered</i> me. 

now, my boss is a man of business. he knows im a far cry from such a thing, but he must not think im stupid. yes, im young, and i havent a degree, but that doesnt mean i dont deserve to get paid what i am worth. my statement included facts like:

1. ive been working there for more than a year (isnt a yearly raise standard in like, every job? or at least, when its obvious your role has changed?) 
2. ive grown from shit-worker (literally) to administering medicine (he trusts me to stick needles into babies, ok?), and have garnered MANY responsibilities and have become very dependent on by them.
3. the past three or so weeks im barely making enough to live on. part of that is the weather's fault, and the bigger part is there isnt any work to do. but its quite obvious in our talks that he wants me to work there, and in my mentioning that im looking for part-time work for the winter he <i>insists</i> there are ""tons of hours"" at the farm, so he wants the farm to be my main focus. i cant let  the two hours i work there in the morning rule my whole day as far as scheduling another job around it, <i>unless he makes it worth it for me</i>.

so what the hell do i do now? he says we'll ""work something out"". that means he has already forgotten everything i said and he'll bring up the whole fact that i have to pay him back for an animal some other day, flippantly and non-commitally, and we will never actually work something out. actually, he did bring up the fact that i could ""sell my first born"", and pay him back that way. as a big fan of/believer in fairy tales, this idea REALLY CREEPS ME OUT. 

his son (one of my ""set/sit-backs"") metioned to me today that i got a good deal on Zia, that shes probably worth as much as ten grand more than what i will be paying. then he remarked that what really matters anyway is that our farm has great genetics, and ""shes a *Maple Brook Farm* animal now"". to which my mind screamed out a big ""FUCK THAT!"". shes a *whatever the hell i would name my farm* animal now!! im not paying 16 grand to ride on Maple Brook's coat-tails! sure, i know part of the reason my boss is helping me out here is so that i feel more invested (ie ""am indebted and must work there by fault""... come on, i know a <i>little</i> bit of that intention is in there), but he must also know that my in- in the alpaca business is also going to be my out- of working for other people-ness. im scared to put all my proverbial eggs in one furry little bread-oven here, but i sort of am. my venture will have MY name i choose for it.

and above all of this business looms a feeling that <i>this is all really fucked up</i>, which is contending with my choices and decisions. the big factors, i mean, what this is really all about, is money, and animals. money i hate, animals i love and try to advocate for. this is not a business in support of that sort of ethic. not that its abusive, buuuut, its objectifying, and its not entirely <i>natural</i>. its also very elite, subjective, and well, its all about money. i dont like that i need money, i dont like people who are surrounded with money, i dont like looking at beautiful, sweet animals and imagining how others look at them and see piles of cash on four legs. i dont like thinking about female animals as ""ovens"", like my boss referred to them the other day. 

so now i have demons. and a boss who will basically loan me $16,000 but wont give me a raise. and a job at Starbucks that i dont really want, and barely had to do more than apply for. and a job offer (though i dont know the details) from my old boss in Gill, MA. and D's parents are *this* close to buying a berry farm which it sounds like i would be a huge part of running. and an ISO conference to go to on Saturday when i would <i>sort of</i> rather stay here and go see Casiotone for the Painfully Alone instead. 




but i will say i had one of the most fun Halloweens in a while yesterday night. Joe and Nikki and i went trick or treating, but for a cause. we collected canned goods and non-perishables for the local shelter. pretty much every person who answered their door was shocked at first. in the first 'hood we visited, most people were surprisingly not into it, saying ""oh, sorry, i dont have any"" (wtf <i>you dont have any</i>?? who doesnt have a can of something?) and similar lazy-ass responses. we got a few things, though. then we went to a different (and noticably better-off) neighborhood, and people gave us armfulls of stuff. i dont know what that means, but the difference in response and additudes was so drastic. people were loving us, lauding our act. some guy said what all those lazy people were thinking: ""you want me to rummage through my cupboards right now?"", and told us to come back some other day, with a positive note of honesty. a woman we talked to had a great candy system. she was talking about how there were numerous ""older"" kids out on Halloween, who sort of shouldnt be (so much), who barely even wear costumes. so she had <b>two</b> candy bowls: the kid bowl, with BIG bars, and the ""shit"" (her wording!) bowl, with little dinky candies. because its true, and ive done candy duty on Halloween before: fucking 6 foot tall football bro-dudes WILL come to your door with black hoodies on over ""Scream"" masks, and if you dont give them <i>something</i>, they will break something in your yard/attached to your body. 

i think in the end we probably got around 50 or so cans/boxes of food. it felt really, really good. waaaaay better than some sugar high."

who wants the job? deciding what jobs i go after, what jobs i take, what jobs i quit, where i put my money, what i say to bosses, what i say to anyone, if and when i am okay to go hang out with people.





i really want to say a lot of things. this isnt the place, and i dont know if there is one. sometimes i/you just want to say things, things that will bother others, but i/you dont want to do that, but i/you want them to know thats how i/you feel, who i/you am/are. i guess it doesnt really matter. 

theyve been re-running old ""Treehouse of Horror"" Simpsons episodes over the past two weeks. yesterday they played the one with the skit that is the first appearance of Kodos and Kang, the aliens who appeared many times afterwards. though their later incarnations where ones chracterized by hostility, in the beginning they were good. they abducted the family, to wine and dine them and be friends. but Lisa didnt trust them. she snooped and looked for flaws and doubted thier intentions. im sort of like Lisa, in more than a few ways, but in this way most definately. and in the end, this spying and distrust ultimatly led to the Simpsons being planted back down onto Earth, having lost an opportunity to live forever and ever in splendor and beauty on the alien's home planet.

lets just say that <i>i'm</i> Lisa, and <i>every -thing, -one, choice, place, option, job, boss, street, meal</i> i come in contact with gets this overanalystic, cynical treatment. and i dont leave it/them alone, i cant sit still, until i loose every -thing, -one, opportunity, etc that i am given, and i end up spinning on my heels right where i always am, stuck.

yeah, that sounds right.




on a more upbeat note, my farm-friend Melanie just called to tell me that she was 100% sure that her name-drop of me got her a job at the Coop. she says everyone there loves me?!?! i dont even know who works there anymore!"

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y15/mygodthelight/animals/Zia.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

her name is Zia. 
and my boss just bought her for me.


yes, i said ""my"", as in ""mine"", as in, i own her and she is mine. that is to say she belongs to me, as in, she is mine. 

<i>damn, i make too many Monty Python referrences that no one ever catches on to...</i>

so yeah... i have an alpaca.



time for the small print. i forgot how to make small print, though, so its going to be regular-sized.
my boss didnt buy her to <i>give</i> her to me, he bought her <i>for</i> me. as in, im paying <i>him</i> back for her, over the next 34739483048 years. well, no, it wont be that long. because im renting-to-own, she's mine already, including whatever offspring she will have (even if i havent paid in full when they are born). 
so, im pretty fucking exciting. and happy. and i feel more secure at my job now. my boss's wife even remarked, after i had stated how incredibly WONDERFUL they are to have done this for me, that i am ""worth it"". IM WORTH AN INVESTMENT OF $16,000 (i mean, my staying there, being part of the farm is worth that). thats pretty damn sweet.

and so here are some pics of my Halloween costume, which is by far the greatest crafty thing i have ever made in my entire life.

the dress is some shitty cheap thing from Forever 21, and i painstakingly covered it with ASSLOADS on yarn. i made rows little wavy loops, and sewed them down. i actually had to make the loops as i went along, so it was like ""make three loops, sew, make three loops, sew"". i was convinced my sewing machine was going to burst into flames 'cause i did this for about 7 hours straight on Saturday (though id been doing it for a few hours every day this past week). underneath it is an impromptu crinoline skirt-thing i made by accordianing some tulle, sewing it to a long scrap, and tying it around my waist.
<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y15/mygodthelight/knitting/halloween05012.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">


my bonnet-thing is a pattern from <u>Stitch n Bitch Nation</u>. i tried to make it on the recommended needle size, which was US8, and honestly, i dont know who in the hells noggin that would have fit. so i frogged it and knit it on some US17's, and it was only slightly too big for me. what the hell is with that? theres a BIG dif between 8 and 17!!

"event","in my current bored-but-not-really-just-trying-to-avoid-doing-other-things so-im-going-to-dig-around-myspace state, i just lucked upon an interesting tidbit of information.

there is a girl, D, who i was somewhat close with from ages oh, 8 to 13 or so. after i broke up with my first ""boyfriend"" in 6th grade (or he broke up with me, because i wouldnt kiss him.. actually, he broke up with me for that reason the first time, then *she actually took part in* our ""getting back together"" [she facilitated communication between us {ie - she went on and knocked on his door}]), D then persued him and they dateed for like the next 4-5 years. around that time our friendship got stressed because, seriously, i couldnt stand her. she was a yes-man if there ever was one. and i cant stand people like that. she was a void, and i had a MUCH better friend this whole time, anyway.

at some point, in my 10th grade year, she became friends with my then-boyfriend, John. actually, how this came about was that i broke up with John, and to get over me he went and lost his virginity to one of the nastiest acting/looking girls in our school. she was friends with D, and apparently D and my former/her current bf were big into swinging and swapping. and through this sort of activity (that my 10th grade mind/kindergarden naievity could NOT bear to think about), D became enamored with John.

D and my ex broke up. then John wanted to get back together with me, and i said ok. i didnt know about any of the stuff i just wrote about. but i heard rumors and D now hated my guts. but she started dressing like i did, when before she had been quite ""normal"", and shaved her head like i had. and through common aquantances i heard that her and John were ""seeing"" each other. our relationship was crappy (it was always pretty child-like, in the least), but now i was a wreck. i found myself shopping, actually started talking to another boy, and so i broke up with John, who was apoligetic and didnt want to. he felt ""guilted"" into cheating. D had always been manipulative. but anyway. then D started creeping into EVERY part of my life.

John and i were still good friends (what can i say, i knew him, and though what he did hurt, i knew he never meant to hurt me.. its tough to get anyone to understand how weak of a person he was), we were bandmates. then D started hanging around where we practiced, started hanging all over my friend Danny (who, incedentally, had carried a thing for me since we had first met 5 years before [he had actually asked me out then]). i stopped hanging around, because i was fucking grossed out. rumor has it that John taped D and Danny having sex. i didnt want anything to do with these people.

anyway, ive found out that D got married. to John's brother.

man. and she has some uuuuuuuuuuuuugly tattoos."

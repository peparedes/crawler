"event","Funny this should look like the 'quiet' week-end  to come that I'd been hoping for for a few weeks in which my week-ends had been so full of things, when over half the people I know are in Leipzig for the WGT living it large. Tonight, a brief birthday meet for a friend at the new incarnation of CCK in Warren Street, tomorrow another brief birthday drinks for another friend. Will probably not do anything more than that this week-end.

Wrist slowly getting better, but still find that playing can be awkward and at times painful, in surprising ways -not necessarily playing difficult things but just finding myself putting my hand in a position it doesn't like. It does seem to finally be getting on its way to getting better, which is at least something.

Have not practised those Thomas Campion songs that I should be preparing for R.D. for a couple of days -she wasn't able to meet this week as she was unwell; I clearly need the pressure in order to work. The version I have has the original English tablature (letter for frets instead of numbers, 'a' is practically identical to 'd', etc) which I find difficult to read -my eyesight is not getting better. The version on two clefs would be quite a job (double transposition, etc, the very reading on two clefs on a guitar, etc) so I've transcribed a few of the songs to modern tab and may write them in music, guitar style (assuming open guitar tuning rather than real pitch, to facilitate the reading) so I can quickly read and play it.

So, an unusual Friday, a QNI, with Attenborough speaking softly from the telly in the distant background while I do other stuff..."

"event","Ah, didn't post about the long May Day (that sounds to me a little less boring than 'bank holiday') week-end. There was quite a bit happening and also quite a lot that I missed -you cannot be everywhere at once. On Friday I went to the Negative Creep, this time at Nambucca in Holloway. Got there in time to see Nemhain's set.. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10154121748549919.1073742097.544159918&amp;type=3"">took pictures, rather many pictures</a>.

On Saturday I went to Jennie and Aya's birthday party. This was a blast and, again, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10154121917239919.1073742098.544159918&amp;type=3"">there are pictures</a>. I think I got away lightly with the roulette game.

Sunday brought about <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10154124066924919.1073742100.544159918&amp;type=3"">the garden party at Karen Georgina's and Lee-Anne's</a> in West London. That garden is so very beautiful. There were lots of lovely people and also a very cute snake (did I just write that? yes, she was a very cute snake). In the  evening I went to the Garage for the Voltaire/Memepunks/Joe Black/Black Volition gig -which was very good, a lot of fun. Yep, <a href=""http://the"">lots more pictures taken</a>. Found myself there with <lj user=""squirmelia"" /> again as well as <lj user=""sashagoblin"" />, <lj user=""_pyromancer_"" />, Jennie and Dan and a lot of other lovely people.

Monday: went with <lj user=""augeas"" />, <lj user=""kekhmet"" />, <lj user=""squirmelia"" />, <lj user=""alexmc"" /> and a couple more folk to the Other Worlds exhibition at the NHM. Of course you will have seen many of the pictures before, they being photos taken by the Cassini and New Horizon probes, the Mars rovers, etc -but presented in an interesting and informative way, accompanied with music by Brian Eno, which I was looking forward to but this (the music) was far less interesting than I anticipated and, perhaps not a lot better than my own electronic ambient doodles that you can find in one of my SoundCloud pages (that no-one ever visits, neither have you so you haven't heard them). Took pictures but none of the exhibition itself. After that we went to Tombo's, Japanese restaurant there in South Ken, and had matcha lattes and Sundaes and lovely Japanese food.

After the very busy previous weekend I was thinking I would have a much quieter one on the bank holiday/May Day one. Wasn't going to happen but it was all good, including for me what may have been some closure for a long-standing painful issue. Not the wrist/elbow, that is an ongoing story but it does seem to be getting better now."

"event","Eventful week-and-a-half. Had doctor's appointment last Wednesday, the results of the MRI scan were back. It turns out that part of the problem was that, unbeknownst to me and  without symptoms thus far, I turned out to have an incipient arthritis in my wrist. If I understood correctly, the two things (arthritis lurking in the background and the trauma and damage resulting from the accident) made each other worse.

It does look like I'll have to be doing those physiotherapy exercises for quite a while. I'm beginning to be able to play, at least, but now and again my hand falls in a position it doesn't like and gives me a severe shooting pain warning.."

There is a reason that you can clearly see, a purpose and a means to work it out it and work along with it. Then you wake up and it.. still is there, clear as crystal and it all makes sense. You stop the alarm, get up, set the coffee maker on, grab the toothbrush... and it slowly begins to melt into the reality of the world; grasping at it while you can still see it is of no avail. It goes and by the time you come out of the shower it's gone. What shreds of it you can still grasp make no sense, they're just the workings of the brain repairing itself from the previous day, or those of the obscurest chemistry of the mind, as remote from our understanding as Andromeda. Never mind, it will come back in the next night's sleep and then maybe we can keep hold of it. Maybe that once."

"event","I was hoping this week-end would be a little more sedate than last. It was -but not by much. On Friday I went to Glitch, a little 80's night in a pub in darkest Hackney -all of which doesn't sound very auspicious but it was a good night with much dancing and catching up with friends old and new -and an encounter with someone from a previous life, something good, someone with whom it was good to reconnect. 

Saturday brought lessons and a computer repair job. I hadn't done that for many years and then after sorting out a pupil's Mac she has been recommending me to people. This was the usual 'my laptop has become very very slow'. On checking it, trying to run a browser, MS Word and a couple of other things on 2 GB memory in these times wasn't going to be blazing fast in the best of cases. Then, looking into it, I begin to find start up items for the infamous MacHelper and Genieo -of course the machine was slow. It is often said by mac fans (like myself, although I'm not remotely as.. ardent as I used to be) that there are no viruses for the Mac and this is technically true -but there is quite a bit of malware out there, that often relies on our being off guard or on the same sort of instinct that tells us that our numbers will win, this week it is going to happen. Or that the nice man from the email really is going to give us a few hundred thousand pounds if we keep that couple of million for him, we only have to give him these advance and our bank details.

I left the computer half way through sorting it out, having replaced the slow spin hard disk for an SSD and having 8 GB to replace the original 2 later. Went to some birthday drinks at the Camden Black Heart -I've said this before, I'm off rock pubs. Anywhere where you have to shout to get heard and strain to hear what the other party says is not a place I want to stay long. Ok, so I'm getting old. From there I went to Yesterday's Shadow at the  Pack and Carriage and danced a bit and conversed some more. On Sunday I had my nightmare lesson, which I survived ok, then a lovely little gathering for Sunday roast with people at the Water Rats. I didn't know most of the people but it was a very good afternoon. Came back to try the 8GB again (it hadn't worked the first time, not a good idea to try to do this kind of thing at 3:00 am after a night out) and this time it worked. Good thing I don't have to get up early on Mondays and work early."

There was a wedding, several birthdays, the usual lessons, a club night, a Sunday outing to Crossness Pumping station and a Sunday evening roast and beer with friends at a pub.

The wedding was that of Robert Cowlin (of the Terminal Gods) and Jo Tapper. I only went to the reception, at Electrowerks (the  site of the Slimelight). I had far more fun then than I'd had at any of the recent times I'd been to the Slimes. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10154076730089919.1073742085.544159918&amp;type=1&amp;l=cafba6d747"">Pictures here</a>.  On Saturday there was also <lj user=""dj_alexander"" />'s birthday in Greenwich. Good catch up with  people although karaoke is really not my thing. Of course I didn't go there to sing but to say happy birthday and share in the celebration -<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10154081691464919.1073742086.544159918&type=1&l=2c29d53f53"">there are some pictures here</a>. After that and one stop-over somewhere else  I went to Reptile where I danced a lot and stayed until 2:30 more or less. 

On Sunday I met with <lj user=""squirmelia"" /> and friends to go to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossness_Pumping_Station"">Crossness Pumping Station</a>. Who would have thought that a Sunday outing to a sewer works could be so much fun and so interesting -it is an old Victorian building, more like a church (or a cathedral, even) than what anybody's idea of a sewer works would be. So, this was a kind of crap day in a very good way.

In the evening I met with a lovely group of people at the North by NorthWest pub (used to be the North Pole, now it's Hitchcock themed, with a wax figure of the egregious man, stuffed crows everywhere and a couple of model aeroplanes and director chairs hanging from the ceiling. I ended up playing Scrabble, which I'm rubbish at -but my team won, how about that.

This was the book set for the April Bibliogoth meeting. A tale of magic and parallel worlds, four cities that share the name and location of London but are utterly different -ours is 'grey London', where magic does not exist. There also are a Red, a White and a Black London, in which magic is prevalent in different ways. The characters were a little bit cartoon-like, almost stereotypical of the genre, as was their quest (any more detail would be a spoiler). For me, the most attractive bit was the world in which the book is set although this, too, needed more fleshing out. As this is the first in a series, I expect this should happen in the later books.

I quite enjoyed this. Can't remember now who recommended it to me (Camille? Katelin?) but thanks! it is perhaps not something I would have gone out of my way to read. Mind, it made me think at first of a sort of Games-of-Thrones and then ... oh, dear, the Walking Dead...(is this a spoiler? :) ) the setting (Restoration London during the Plague) is a fascinating time of history and the author uses it very effectively. Suspension of disbelief does get stretched at times but overall it is an enjoyable read.

In spite of initial reservations, I loved the whole series -and the second one I liked better than the first. The characters are .. better shaped, more credible as people. The dragons themselves are quite believable on the whole as an object of interest to a scientist. Some things still jar a bit -one, for me, was that for some reason I found the use of German, French and Italian names (and perhaps stereotypical national characters). On the whole, though, it was an enjoyable book, an enjoyable series.

Wrist is not. It still hurts, three weeks on; I still cannot play the guitar at all and many things are very awkward to do. Yesterday I tried to play a few notes and quickly decided that was a bad idea. Patience is the only course of action but I will be asking the docs when I go to an appointment in two weeks time (I have to go back to the Royal Free hospital next week for a physio session -will be asking questions then as well if they let me).

Early Easter week-end this year -I will be mostly at home; still have one or two lessons. Only a couple of outings, one club and a couple of social things.

Today I will be going with friends to <a href=""http://highgatecemetery.org"">Highgate West Cemetery</a> for a guided tour. Seemed like a good thing to do on a Good Friday. Tomorrow there'll be some birthday drinks for a friend WOLJ at the Big Red in Holloway. Sunday I will be going to a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1555083068152701/?ref=1&action_history=%5B%7B%22surface%22%3A%22permalink%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22surface%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%5B%5D%7D%5D"">Sunday roast with friends in Stoke Newington</a> and, in the evening, to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/242573949408951/?ref=2&ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming&action_history=null"">Invocation</a> at the Minories in Tower Hill. Monday... I will be doing as little as possible. Seriously."

"event","On a Met line train, making my way out of London for my teaching day in Watofordo. Running very late, won't be able to move stuff around (which will prevent me from using my printer, locked in a filing cabinet in my old teaching room which I cannot use because of a broken window mechanism that the school hasn't had time to fix, it's only been nine months since I reported it for the first time). This is probably going to be an interesting teaching day. As per the old supposedly Chinese curse.

The BT/Openreach engineer came yesterday, fixed the line, confirmed that 'somebody' had disconnected me to connect somebody else. This makes me wonder how long I will have telephone and internet before it happens again if it happened twice within 36 hours.

Elbow seems to be healing well but now I'm getting pain in my wrist (and more creaking when I turn it -not liking this much) and have noticed bruises on my knee and my leg that I hadn't noticed before, maybe because of the elbow. I should be able to play the guitar by the end of the week. I hope so; it is so much more long-winded to explain things in words than to demonstrate guitar in hand, even if you have the right words

Wondering about some friendships of mine (ok, one) that seem to be one way only, as in 'I try to be a friend, the other person tolerates my friendship'. That is not a satisfactory situation and I think I'll just get out of their hair. Anyone who reads this and knows my recent history will probably know who I'm talking about. Not their fault, we all are how we are.

Need to push the house-concert microgig idea more and get myself a few recitals for the summer. I'm so rubbish at 'selling the product', though. Need an agent, clearly... but that's another minefield.

Well, that's the current state of the flavio, I think. That, and strange dreams of loss and recovery and strange but familiar distant cities."

"event","Getting slightly better mobility on my arm, which is good. Strangely, now my wrist is hurting and creaking more -but the hospital people say this is not related to the bone fracture. Have cancelled my teaching day at the school in Highgate today. Could probably do the teaching (albeit explaining in words rather than demonstrating by playing, which is always more convoluted -and with such short lessons as they do there...) but there's a certain amount of moving kit around (guitars, amp, my own printer which lives in a cardboard box there because the school hasn't got round to giving me access to the school network so I can print on the music office's laser) involved -and I already know that with elbow injuries you tend to think it's ok, overdo it and make it bad again, so trying to avoid that.

No news on the telephone/internet front, so at the moment I'm getting a trickle of internet by means of sticking my mobile phone to the window inside a wok which acts as a reflecting dish (as per a radar dish, I'm told) -thanks to Tarquin Finch for this excellent idea that actually works. Well, works well enough for a temporary work-around but would not want to depend on that permanently."

"event","Well, the last few days have been rather strange and testing. In minor ways, nothing very dramatic but all the little things together do accumulate.

The most dramatic bit (or perhaps the most ridiculous one)  must be my getting run over by a bicycle while coming back from feeding a travelling friend's cat. This resulted in a fractured radius, which impacts rather a lot of what I do: I cannot drive, lift weights... more importantly, I cannot play the guitar, which makes teaching it rather more complicated -half a bar of music demonstrated to a pupil can be worth hundreds of words. Literally. I also cannot properly wash or shower or do anything that requires two functional arms. Stretching or bending my left arm results in horrific shooting pain. Moving it at certain angles produces an intense pain that is very much like a cramp. Luckily (?) the bone didn't break, just fractured lengthwise and didn't change its position. Also feeling, curiously, like I let my friend down, somehow. One good thing is that the Royal Free Hospital people reassure me it won't take six weeks for me to be playing the guitar. Now, they do require me to do exercises stretching, flexing and rotating the arm. In other words, all the things that currently make me scream in agony...

The internet situation is even more strange. I had reported that my telephone line and broadband were dead. An engineer came on Monday and sorted it out, telling me that somebody ('a contractor, surely') had just disconnected me in order to connect somebody else. He reconnected me and I had internet and telephone... for less than 36 hours. Yesterday evening the line was dead again. I need the internet for a lot of stuff, partly for my teaching (I do a couple of online lessons) and communication with my pupils in several ways, apart from everything else I use it for. If that engineer was right I might be getting a sort of war of attrition, if BT/Openreach are going to be coming to fix that line for it to be pulled by ... whoever is doing it. This is unsustainable. We'll have to wait and see.

One little thing that compounds the internet situation is that I have very poor mobile reception in my flat. With luck I get enough to make phone calls (which often become warbly or get cut off). This hasn't always been the case and started about a year and a half ago. It means that in order to get some very patchy, very very slow internet I must put my mobile phone out the window and then tether the computer to it. Absurd, in these days. There's been  a couple of other irritants these last few days but that's probably enough to mention. Nothing fatal, nothing big enough to warrant a good fit of sobbing screaming, but..."

"event","I seem to have survived another Valentine's Day, one with the potential to be a particularly painful one. Managed instead to have a good time with friends at a double birthday party (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153919785389919.1073742070.544159918&type=1&l=fc650431ed"">there are pictures</a>) and later at the Slimelight. I've never really really had a very bad night at the Slime but this was a good candidate, although not for lack of good company, having arrived with the birthday boy and girl and their entourage that included <lj user=""londonjon"" /> and <lj user=""rougeno1"" /> and running into <lj user=""djpsyche"" /> and a few other peeps. The one dancing room I found painfully loud (it did feel like much louder than usual, it may have been me) and didn't have ear-plugs with me so I stayed in the courtyard talking to people. Lasted about an hour and a half and left for home. Better than other possibilities for the night. Next month I'll be at Reptile. This last one.. no, I couldn't do that to myself. Funny how it works. All these things (Christmas, birthdays, etc) are arbitrary markers, this day is significative because we decide it is. And many of those days are just vehicles for the commercial juggernaut to make us buy things. And yet we need them and they often work. Except when they work in a way that makes us feel worse not better.

Sunday brought the monthly <lj user=""bibliogoth"" /> meeting, this time discussing '<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libra_(novel)"">Libra</a>' by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_DeLillo"">Don Delillo</a>, a sort of history-fiction account of Lee Harvey Oswald's life leading to John F Kennedy's assassination. The person in the group that was the most familiar with the book hated it. I, the only person in the group that was alive at the time of the events, quite liked it although I did find the first few chapters difficult to get on with, particularly with the swarm of Federal agents that all 'looked' identical and in my mind were all like copies of the Matrix's Agent Smith. A very interesting discussion that centred more on the events that the book explores rather than the book itself."

"event","You may have noticed, if you read this, that I'm allowing myself to put slightly more personal stuff in here. I still think it is a very bad idea to put _very_ personal stuff in a public social platform or, well, anywhere on the internet. OTOH, what do I care, as long as I don't name people: I'm never going to go for a job interview, nobody really cares what I write in here and my livejournal is read, for the most part, by a tiny number of people in whom I trust. I stil think it is a very bad idea to use this or any other public platform to complain about your boss, your partner or to put any details about your lifestyle, mental health or any other aspect of your life that can be brought up in the future and used against you.

In the meantime, I quite like that there are a few more people writing and, amazingly, reading livejournal. I so much prefer it to Facebook, immensely useful as the latter is -FB has many questionable or worrying sides to it and also seems to encourage a shorter, shallower sort of communication."

"event","A sunny morning on a train to Watford, another strange day in which everybody I know is mourning somebody they never met -but who has touched their lives and given them a soundtrack and a momentum, even perhaps helped give it some significance. 

As the train moves ever closer to the beginning of my teaching day, I try to recall what I was dreaming last night, or only two hours ago -it seemed momentous at the time, I woke up clearly remembering everything vividly -or so I thought- and now I cannot even recall what it was about, what the astounding insight I was having of the connection between things apparently unrelated in the real world was. All an illusion, but so seductive at the time, leaving me longing for whatever it was that is now lost down the washbasin's plughole."

I'm never actually there in the dreams -I'm always somewhere else (normally Caracas) and something prevents me from going back -and my guitars, my computers and my books, as well as my working life, are all back there, so it is almost a nightmare although not quite. But I could describe in detail my room in the house I share there (in the dream) with another musician, the little balcony, the battered garden set in it, the plants, the old music stand I have (don't know where that comes from, never had a wooden music stand). Like peeking into a world that could have been, or into that multi-dimensional  shift-space of possible lives that never were...."

So, what to do.... ok, put some chorizo sausage from the local butcher, garlic, potatoes and olive oil, salt and pepper and quite a bit of rosemary (and a little bit of oregano) in an oven dish, stick it in the oven for the duration of three rounds of Bach Chaconne's arpeggios plus a few chromatic scales. It works!"

"event","Remarkably busy week-end. I should start that on the Thursday, when I went to the <lj user=""londongothsluts"" /> meeting at the Doric Arch -particularly since I didn't have to go to school on the Friday. I did go to <lj user=""deadandburied"" /> (ah, that's still there, even though Nik hasn't posted for many an eon) in Archway. That was an excellent party. Saturday was very good, if a tiny little bit bittersweet for me in parts. A couple of lessons, then to the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/729647970478981/"">Bart's Christmas Bazaar</a> with my friend Jennie with the idea of buying a couple of little pressies for <lj user=""redd_foxx"" /> who always buys me lots of little presents for xmas  and I hardly buy her anything back. Didn't find anything that would really catch me but did buy a couple of things. We left and ended up in a Nicholson's pub nearby, had a lovely catch up and finally each left for their home -I only briefly, as was going to Cavey Nik's (seems he has finally deleted his old LJ) birthday meal at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/JashanTPL/"">Jashan's Indian restaurant</a> in Turnpike Lane. This turned out to be very good, perhaps not the cheapest but very very nice food. A lovely meeting of people, too. I think the birthday boy was happy.

Sunday brought, apart from my most difficult lesson of the week, the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/32039652963"">Alternative Bring & Buy</a> at the Dome in Tufnell Park. This was, as always, a lovely event. Again, I came back with a couple of small things. In the evening there was the 'after-event' party at Aces & Eights in Tufnell Park. Pizza and beers with friends."

"event","Get up, check how much sleep I've had (the Pebble tells me that) -never enough. Drag myself up, take the pill that I probably don't need but a prescription is a prescription, grab a change of socks and underwear, wake the computer up as I stagger to the bathroom, drop the socks, etc, gargle some Corsodyl and stumble over to the kitchen to grind some coffee beans, switch the Gaggia coffee machine on, stagger back to bathroom, brush teeth, have a hot shower, back to the kitchen to make coffee.. and those two things are the nice little things in my morning -the hot shower, the first sip of home made espresso. Check livejournal, check FB, check my calendar, send a couple of birthday greetings, drink the rest of the coffee.. get ready to leave for lessons. If it is a Tuesday, I no longer have to get up at 5:20 am (that's the good bit) but have fewer pupils at WBGS and therefore less money coming in and have to negotiate the Northern Line right at peak hour for the first time since forever. I'll be on the Met Line to Watford slowly making its way out of London, replying to emails, writing little poemoids, looking out the window, trying to resist the temptation of writing to the woman I love because there is no point. The world outside slides quickly past, it seems to be full of things -it shouldn't feel so void and empty. Moor Park, Croxley; we're getting there. Somewhere. But it doesn't really feel like we're getting anywhere."

"event","In trying to avoid reading 'Infinite Jest' by David Foster Walace, which is the book marked for discussion on the next <lj user=""bibliogoth"" /> meeting -book which I'm finding extremely tiresome to read, I have been reading or re-reading a few other books, including a couple of the Peter Grant series by Ben Aaronovitch, the whole Merchant Prince series by Charlie Stross, re-reading 'Matter' by Iain M Banks, which was the first Culture book I read and finding that I had missed so much detail and reference the first time round, and also now 'Starship Troopers' by Heinlein. Have enjoyed all of these in different ways; Aaronovitch books present bits of London that are part of my life in a different light; the Stross series is yet another Parallel Worlds story but a very well told one -and although it is a bit late it is nice to see G W Bush and Cheney dispatched like that, at least in prose. 'Troopers' is a slightly different case. I'm enjoying reading it but I can see I wouldn't be able to see eye to eye with Mr Heinlein on practically any social or political issue, I find him profoundly reactionary, the society he depicts borderline fascist. It is a good read, though."

"event","The week-end had the big shadow of the incidents in Paris over it -and the reaction of the media and of people, mainly on Twitter and Facebook (and, in one case, in person, where a friend of a friend started having a go at the refugees and the old 'there's too many of them lot over here already', as if not aware that she hadn't been talking to somebody who, albeit in very different circumstances, started life 'out there'). But all that came later.

Thursday evening I went to the Gothsluts weekly meeting, this time at the Angel in Bermondsey. A Sam Smith pub, it seemingly has many strange rules of the house that I wasn't aware of. First the Italian guy at the bar (I think he's the manager, he seemed to be in charge) stopped me short when I spoke to him in Italian, 'speake in Englishe, the customer over there (points at a customer at the bar) could think we're talking about him'. I refrained to mention that the pointing thing was more rude than any imaginary offence for not understanding what other people were saying. Rules of the company, he said.

I had gone to the pub straight from a lesson so I had a guitar. Dylan wanted to have a go so we brought the guitar out of the case -and the same Italian member of staff came and told us. We weren't allowed to make any sort of music in the house. Rules of the company, he said. Ooh kay then. The booze is cheap there, the food is cheap and ok, the view of the riverside is lovely but I don't think I'll be voting for that pub for the meetings again.

The company was excellent, though."

"event","On Friday mr <lj user=""lproven"" /> was celebrating his birthday at a pub in Chiswick, the  so I went. The pub was ok, made me think a little bit of the Pembury Tavern for some reason -certainly not for the variety of ales on pat, mind. It was ok and it was a good gathering, though. I had occasion to remind Liam of how he embarrassed me in the summer at Infest, embarrassing him in turn so perhaps we're quits. Ok, I'll never forgive him.. :D

Saturday brought about <lj user=""dj_alexander"" />'s and Liz's wedding in faraway Bexley, which was a good party if, for a party of goths, not a goth party at all. Made it on time for the last train back to Charing Cross with, again, <lj user=""lproven"" />, which was good. Once home I phoned (on Skype) <lj user=""maragotika"" /> to say happy birthday.. ended up going to bed at 4. My photos of the reception are <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153723261814919.1073742039.544159918&amp;type=3"">here</a>.

Sunday came with the most challenging guitar lesson of the week -after that, shattered, I staggered to the Landseer in Holloway for Sunday roast with a few friends, which was very and made up for the earlier horrors."

Looks ok, it's quite busy at the moment and has several interesting angles (some of which in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsu_%28social_network%29"">their Wikipedia page</a>). Do they have a chance? Erm... probably not. So many have come and gone. The main problem with Facebook is not features, it seems to me, but momentum and, most of all, reach. If you can persuade my sister in Venezuela, my cousins and old aunties in Italy, my friends in the four corners of the globe to switch away from Facebook I'll then believe you have a FB killer. In the meantime, it's just a little fun to play with.

In any event, I'm there at http://www.tsu.co/flaviomatani -you can set up an account starting on that link."

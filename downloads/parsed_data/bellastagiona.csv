<b>""On the Mindless Menace of Violence""</b>
by Robert F. Kennedy
<i>(a speech given at the City Club of Cleveland (Ohio) on April 5, 1968)</i>

This is a time of shame and sorrow. It is not a day for politics. I have saved this one opportunity, my only event of today, to speak briefly to you about the mindless menace of violence in America which again stains our land and every one of our lives.

It is not the concern of any one race. The victims of the violence are black and white, rich and poor, young and old, famous and unknown. They are, most important of all, human beings whom other human beings loved and needed. No one - no matter where he lives or what he does - can be certain who will suffer from some senseless act of bloodshed. And yet it goes on and on and on in this country of ours.

Why? What has violence ever accomplished? What has it ever created? No martyr's cause has ever been stilled by an assassin's bullet.

No wrongs have ever been righted by riots and civil disorders. A sniper is only a coward, not a hero; and an uncontrolled, uncontrollable mob is only the voice of madness, not the voice of reason.

Whenever any American's life is taken by another American unnecessarily - whether it is done in the name of the law or in the defiance of the law, by one man or a gang, in cold blood or in passion, in an attack of violence or in response to violence - whenever we tear at the fabric of the life which another man has painfully and clumsily woven for himself and his children, the whole nation is degraded.

""Among free men,"" said Abraham Lincoln, ""there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet; and those who take such appeal are sure to lose their cause and pay the costs.""

Yet we seemingly tolerate a rising level of violence that ignores our common humanity and our claims to civilization alike. We calmly accept newspaper reports of civilian slaughter in far-off lands. We glorify killing on movie and television screens and call it entertainment. We make it easy for men of all shades of sanity to acquire whatever weapons and ammunition they desire.

Too often we honor swagger and bluster and wielders of force; too often we excuse those who are willing to build their own lives on the shattered dreams of others. Some Americans who preach non-violence abroad fail to practice it here at home. Some who accuse others of inciting riots have by their own conduct invited them.

Some look for scapegoats, others look for conspiracies, but this much is clear: violence breeds violence, repression brings retaliation, and only a cleansing of our whole society can remove this sickness from our soul.

For there is another kind of violence, slower but just as deadly destructive as the shot or the bomb in the night. This is the violence of institutions; indifference and inaction and slow decay. This is the violence that afflicts the poor, that poisons relations between men because their skin has different colors. This is the slow destruction of a child by hunger, and schools without books and homes without heat in the winter.

This is the breaking of a man's spirit by denying him the chance to stand as a father and as a man among other men. And this too afflicts us all.

I have not come here to propose a set of specific remedies nor is there a single set. For a broad and adequate outline we know what must be done. When you teach a man to hate and fear his brother, when you teach that he is a lesser man because of his color or his beliefs or the policies he pursues, when you teach that those who differ from you threaten your freedom or your job or your family, then you also learn to confront others not as fellow citizens but as enemies, to be met not with cooperation but with conquest; to be subjugated and mastered.

We learn, at the last, to look at our brothers as aliens, men with whom we share a city, but not a community; men bound to us in common dwelling, but not in common effort. We learn to share only a common fear, only a common desire to retreat from each other, only a common impulse to meet disagreement with force. For all this, there are no final answers.

Yet we know what we must do. It is to achieve true justice among our fellow citizens. The question is not what programs we should seek to enact. The question is whether we can find in our own midst and in our own hearts that leadership of humane purpose that will recognize the terrible truths of our existence.

We must admit the vanity of our false distinctions among men and learn to find our own advancement in the search for the advancement of others. We must admit in ourselves that our own children's future cannot be built on the misfortunes of others. We must recognize that this short life can neither be ennobled or enriched by hatred or revenge.

Our lives on this planet are too short and the work to be done too great to let this spirit flourish any longer in our land. Of course we cannot vanquish it with a program, nor with a resolution.

But we can perhaps remember, if only for a time, that those who live with us are our brothers, that they share with us the same short moment of life; that they seek, as do we, nothing but the chance to live out their lives in purpose and in happiness, winning what satisfaction and fulfillment they can.

Surely, this bond of common faith, this bond of common goal, can begin to teach us something. Surely, we can learn, at least, to look at those around us as fellow men, and surely we can begin to work a little harder to bind up the wounds among us and to become in our own hearts brothers and countrymen once again.</lj-cut>

<b>""Farmer in Chief""</b>
by Michael Pollan
<i>for the New York Times Magazine, October 12, 2008</i>

Dear Mr. President-Elect,

It may surprise you to learn that among the issues that will occupy much of your time in the coming years is one you barely mentioned during the campaign: food. Food policy is not something American presidents have had to give much thought to, at least since the Nixon administration--the last time high food prices presented a serious political peril. Since then, federal policies to promote maximum production of the commodity crops (corn, soybeans, wheat and rice) from which most of our supermarket foods are derived have succeeded impressively in keeping prices low and food more or less off the national political agenda. But with a suddenness that has taken us all by surprise, the era of cheap and abundant food appears to be drawing to a close. What this means is that you, like so many other leaders through history, will find yourself confronting the fact--so easy to overlook these past few years--that the health of a nation's food system is a critical issue of national security. Food is about to demand your attention.

Complicating matters is the fact that the price and abundance of food are not the only problems we face; if they were, you could simply follow Nixon's example, appoint a latter-day Earl Butz as your secretary of agriculture and instruct him or her to do whatever it takes to boost production. But there are reasons to think that the old approach won't work this time around; for one thing, it depends on cheap energy that we can no longer count on. For another, expanding production of industrial agriculture today would require you to sacrifice important values on which you did campaign. Which brings me to the deeper reason you will need not simply to address food prices but to make the reform of the entire food system one of the highest priorities of your administration: unless you do, you will not be able to make significant progress on the health care crisis, energy independence or climate change. Unlike food, these are issues you did campaign on -- but as you try to address them you will quickly discover that the way we currently grow, process and eat food in America goes to the heart of all three problems and will have to change if we hope to solve them. Let me explain.

After cars, the food system uses more fossil fuel than any other sector of the economy -- 19 percent. And while the experts disagree about the exact amount, the way we feed ourselves contributes more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere than anything else we do -- as much as 37 percent, according to one study. Whenever farmers clear land for crops and till the soil, large quantities of carbon are released into the air. But the 20th-century industrialization of agriculture has increased the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by the food system by an order of magnitude; chemical fertilizers (made from natural gas), pesticides (made from petroleum), farm machinery, modern food processing and packaging and transportation have together transformed a system that in 1940 produced 2.3 calories of food energy for every calorie of fossil-fuel energy it used into one that now takes 10 calories of fossil-fuel energy to produce a single calorie of modern supermarket food. Put another way, when we eat from the industrial-food system, we are eating oil and spewing greenhouse gases. This state of affairs appears all the more absurd when you recall that every calorie we eat is ultimately the product of photosynthesis -- a process based on making food energy from sunshine. There is hope and possibility in that simple fact.

In addition to the problems of climate change and America's oil addiction, you have spoken at length on the campaign trail of the health care crisis. Spending on health care has risen from 5 percent of national income in 1960 to 16 percent today, putting a significant drag on the economy. The goal of ensuring the health of all Americans depends on getting those costs under control. There are several reasons health care has gotten so expensive, but one of the biggest, and perhaps most tractable, is the cost to the system of preventable chronic diseases. Four of the top 10 killers in America today are chronic diseases linked to diet: heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and cancer. It is no coincidence that in the years national spending on health care went from 5 percent to 16 percent of national income, spending on food has fallen by a comparable amount -- from 18 percent of household income to less than 10 percent. While the surfeit of cheap calories that the U.S. food system has produced since the late 1970s may have taken food prices off the political agenda, this has come at a steep cost to public health. You cannot expect to reform the health care system, much less expand coverage, without confronting the public-health catastrophe that is the modern American diet.

The impact of the American food system on the rest of the world will have implications for your foreign and trade policies as well. In the past several months more than 30 nations have experienced food riots, and so far one government has fallen. Should high grain prices persist and shortages develop, you can expect to see the pendulum shift decisively away from free trade, at least in food. Nations that opened their markets to the global flood of cheap grain (under pressure from previous administrations as well as the World Bank and the I.M.F.) lost so many farmers that they now find their ability to feed their own populations hinges on decisions made in Washington (like your predecessor's precipitous embrace of biofuels) and on Wall Street. They will now rush to rebuild their own agricultural sectors and then seek to protect them by erecting trade barriers. Expect to hear the phrases ""food sovereignty"" and ""food security"" on the lips of every foreign leader you meet. Not only the Doha round, but the whole cause of free trade in agriculture is probably dead, the casualty of a cheap food policy that a scant two years ago seemed like a boon for everyone. It is one of the larger paradoxes of our time that the very same food policies that have contributed to overnutrition in the first world are now contributing to undernutrition in the third. But it turns out that too much food can be nearly as big a problem as too little -- a lesson we should keep in mind as we set about designing a new approach to food policy.

Rich or poor, countries struggling with soaring food prices are being forcibly reminded that food is a national-security issue. When a nation loses the ability to substantially feed itself, it is not only at the mercy of global commodity markets but of other governments as well. At issue is not only the availability of food, which may be held hostage by a hostile state, but its safety: as recent scandals in China demonstrate, we have little control over the safety of imported foods. The deliberate contamination of our food presents another national-security threat. At his valedictory press conference in 2004, Tommy Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, offered a chilling warning, saying, ""I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not attacked our food supply, because it is so easy to do.""

This, in brief, is the bad news: the food and agriculture policies you've inherited -- designed to maximize production at all costs and relying on cheap energy to do so -- are in shambles, and the need to address the problems they have caused is acute. The good news is that the twinned crises in food and energy are creating a political environment in which real reform of the food system may actually be possible for the first time in a generation. The American people are paying more attention to food today than they have in decades, worrying not only about its price but about its safety, its provenance and its healthfulness. There is a gathering sense among the public that the industrial-food system is broken. Markets for alternative kinds of food -- organic, local, pasture-based, humane -- are thriving as never before. All this suggests that a political constituency for change is building and not only on the left: lately, conservative voices have also been raised in support of reform. Writing of the movement back to local food economies, traditional foods (and family meals) and more sustainable farming, The American Conservative magazine editorialized last summer that ""this is a conservative cause if ever there was one.""

There are many moving parts to the new food agenda I'm urging you to adopt, but the core idea could not be simpler: we need to wean the American food system off its heavy 20th-century diet of fossil fuel and put it back on a diet of contemporary sunshine. True, this is easier said than done -- fossil fuel is deeply implicated in everything about the way we currently grow food and feed ourselves. To put the food system back on sunlight will require policies to change how things work at every link in the food chain: in the farm field, in the way food is processed and sold and even in the American kitchen and at the American dinner table. Yet the sun still shines down on our land every day, and photosynthesis can still work its wonders wherever it does. If any part of the modern economy can be freed from its dependence on oil and successfully resolarized, surely it is food.

<b>How We Got Here</b>

Before setting out an agenda for reforming the food system, it's important to understand how that system came to be -- and also to appreciate what, for all its many problems, it has accomplished. What our food system does well is precisely what it was designed to do, which is to produce cheap calories in great abundance. It is no small thing for an American to be able to go into a fast-food restaurant and to buy a double cheeseburger, fries and a large Coke for a price equal to less than an hour of labor at the minimum wage -- indeed, in the long sweep of history, this represents a remarkable achievement.

It must be recognized that the current food system -- characterized by monocultures of corn and soy in the field and cheap calories of fat, sugar and feedlot meat on the table -- is not simply the product of the free market. Rather, it is the product of a specific set of government policies that sponsored a shift from solar (and human) energy on the farm to fossil-fuel energy.

Did you notice when you flew over Iowa during the campaign how the land was completely bare -- black -- from October to April? What you were seeing is the agricultural landscape created by cheap oil. In years past, except in the dead of winter, you would have seen in those fields a checkerboard of different greens: pastures and hayfields for animals, cover crops, perhaps a block of fruit trees. Before the application of oil and natural gas to agriculture, farmers relied on crop diversity (and photosynthesis) both to replenish their soil and to combat pests, as well as to feed themselves and their neighbors. Cheap energy, however, enabled the creation of monocultures, and monocultures in turn vastly increased the productivity both of the American land and the American farmer; today the typical corn-belt farmer is single-handedly feeding 140 people.

This did not occur by happenstance. After World War II, the government encouraged the conversion of the munitions industry to fertilizer -- ammonium nitrate being the main ingredient of both bombs and chemical fertilizer -- and the conversion of nerve-gas research to pesticides. The government also began subsidizing commodity crops, paying farmers by the bushel for all the corn, soybeans, wheat and rice they could produce. One secretary of agriculture after another implored them to plant ""fence row to fence row"" and to ""get big or get out.""

The chief result, especially after the Earl Butz years, was a flood of cheap grain that could be sold for substantially less than it cost farmers to grow because a government check helped make up the difference. As this artificially cheap grain worked its way up the food chain, it drove down the price of all the calories derived from that grain: the high-fructose corn syrup in the Coke, the soy oil in which the potatoes were fried, the meat and cheese in the burger.

Subsidized monocultures of grain also led directly to monocultures of animals: since factory farms could buy grain for less than it cost farmers to grow it, they could now fatten animals more cheaply than farmers could. So America's meat and dairy animals migrated from farm to feedlot, driving down the price of animal protein to the point where an American can enjoy eating, on average, 190 pounds of meat a year -- a half pound every day.

But if taking the animals off farms made a certain kind of economic sense, it made no ecological sense whatever: their waste, formerly regarded as a precious source of fertility on the farm, became a pollutant -- factory farms are now one of America's biggest sources of pollution. As Wendell Berry has tartly observed, to take animals off farms and put them on feedlots is to take an elegant solution -- animals replenishing the fertility that crops deplete -- and neatly divide it into two problems: a fertility problem on the farm and a pollution problem on the feedlot. The former problem is remedied with fossil-fuel fertilizer; the latter is remedied not at all.

What was once a regional food economy is now national and increasingly global in scope -- thanks again to fossil fuel. Cheap energy -- for trucking food as well as pumping water -- is the reason New York City now gets its produce from California rather than from the ""Garden State"" next door, as it did before the advent of Interstate highways and national trucking networks. More recently, cheap energy has underwritten a globalized food economy in which it makes (or rather, made) economic sense to catch salmon in Alaska, ship it to China to be filleted and then ship the fillets back to California to be eaten; or one in which California and Mexico can profitably swap tomatoes back and forth across the border; or Denmark and the United States can trade sugar cookies across the Atlantic. About that particular swap the economist Herman Daly once quipped, ""Exchanging recipes would surely be more efficient.""

Whatever we may have liked about the era of cheap, oil-based food, it is drawing to a close. Even if we were willing to continue paying the environmental or public-health price, we're not going to have the cheap energy (or the water) needed to keep the system going, much less expand production. But as is so often the case, a crisis provides opportunity for reform, and the current food crisis presents opportunities that must be seized.

In drafting these proposals, I've adhered to a few simple principles of what a 21st-century food system needs to do. First, your administration's food policy must strive to provide a healthful diet for all our people; this means focusing on the quality and diversity (and not merely the quantity) of the calories that American agriculture produces and American eaters consume. Second, your policies should aim to improve the resilience, safety and security of our food supply. Among other things, this means promoting regional food economies both in America and around the world. And lastly, your policies need to reconceive agriculture as part of the solution to environmental problems like climate change.

These goals are admittedly ambitious, yet they will not be difficult to align or advance as long as we keep in mind this One Big Idea: most of the problems our food system faces today are because of its reliance on fossil fuels, and to the extent that our policies wring the oil out of the system and replace it with the energy of the sun, those policies will simultaneously improve the state of our health, our environment and our security.

<b>I. Resolarizing the American Farm</b>

What happens in the field influences every other link of the food chain on up to our meals -- if we grow monocultures of corn and soy, we will find the products of processed corn and soy on our plates. Fortunately for your initiative, the federal government has enormous leverage in determining exactly what happens on the 830 million acres of American crop and pasture land.

Today most government farm and food programs are designed to prop up the old system of maximizing production from a handful of subsidized commodity crops grown in monocultures. Even food-assistance programs like WIC and school lunch focus on maximizing quantity rather than quality, typically specifying a minimum number of calories (rather than maximums) and seldom paying more than lip service to nutritional quality. This focus on quantity may have made sense in a time of food scarcity, but today it gives us a school-lunch program that feeds chicken nuggets and Tater Tots to overweight and diabetic children.

Your challenge is to take control of this vast federal machinery and use it to drive a transition to a new solar-food economy, starting on the farm. Right now, the government actively discourages the farmers it subsidizes from growing healthful, fresh food: farmers receiving crop subsidies are prohibited from growing ""specialty crops"" -- farm-bill speak for fruits and vegetables. (This rule was the price exacted by California and Florida produce growers in exchange for going along with subsidies for commodity crops.) Commodity farmers should instead be encouraged to grow as many different crops -- including animals -- as possible. Why? Because the greater the diversity of crops on a farm, the less the need for both fertilizers and pesticides.

The power of cleverly designed polycultures to produce large amounts of food from little more than soil, water and sunlight has been proved, not only by small-scale ""alternative"" farmers in the United States but also by large rice-and-fish farmers in China and giant-scale operations (up to 15,000 acres) in places like Argentina. There, in a geography roughly comparable to that of the American farm belt, farmers have traditionally employed an ingenious eight-year rotation of perennial pasture and annual crops: after five years grazing cattle on pasture (and producing the world's best beef), farmers can then grow three years of grain without applying any fossil-fuel fertilizer. Or, for that matter, many pesticides: the weeds that afflict pasture can't survive the years of tillage, and the weeds of row crops don't survive the years of grazing, making herbicides all but unnecessary. There is no reason -- save current policy and custom -- that American farmers couldn't grow both high-quality grain and grass-fed beef under such a regime through much of the Midwest. (It should be noted that today's sky-high grain prices are causing many Argentine farmers to abandon their rotation to grow grain and soybeans exclusively, an environmental disaster in the making.)

Federal policies could do much to encourage this sort of diversified sun farming. Begin with the subsidies: payment levels should reflect the number of different crops farmers grow or the number of days of the year their fields are green -- that is, taking advantage of photosynthesis, whether to grow food, replenish the soil or control erosion. If Midwestern farmers simply planted a cover crop after the fall harvest, they would significantly reduce their need for fertilizer, while cutting down on soil erosion. Why don't farmers do this routinely? Because in recent years fossil-fuel-based fertility has been so much cheaper and easier to use than sun-based fertility.

In addition to rewarding farmers for planting cover crops, we should make it easier for them to apply compost to their fields -- a practice that improves not only the fertility of the soil but also its ability to hold water and therefore withstand drought. (There is mounting evidence that it also boosts the nutritional quality of the food grown in it.) The U.S.D.A. estimates that Americans throw out 14 percent of the food they buy; much more is wasted by retailers, wholesalers and institutions. A program to make municipal composting of food and yard waste mandatory and then distributing the compost free to area farmers would shrink America's garbage heap, cut the need for irrigation and fossil-fuel fertilizers in agriculture and improve the nutritional quality of the American diet.

Right now, most of the conservation programs run by the U.S.D.A. are designed on the zero-sum principle: land is either locked up in ""conservation"" or it is farmed intensively. This either-or approach reflects an outdated belief that modern farming and ranching are inherently destructive, so that the best thing for the environment is to leave land untouched. But we now know how to grow crops and graze animals in systems that will support biodiversity, soil health, clean water and carbon sequestration. The Conservation Stewardship Program, championed by Senator Tom Harkin and included in the 2008 Farm Bill, takes an important step toward rewarding these kinds of practices, but we need to move this approach from the periphery of our farm policy to the very center. Longer term, the government should back ambitious research now under way (at the Land Institute in Kansas and a handful of other places) to ""perennialize"" commodity agriculture: to breed varieties of wheat, rice and other staple grains that can be grown like prairie grasses -- without having to till the soil every year. These perennial grains hold the promise of slashing the fossil fuel now needed to fertilize and till the soil, while protecting farmland from erosion and sequestering significant amounts of carbon.

But that is probably a 50-year project. For today's agriculture to wean itself from fossil fuel and make optimal use of sunlight, crop plants and animals must once again be married on the farm -- as in Wendell Berry's elegant ""solution."" Sunlight nourishes the grasses and grains, the plants nourish the animals, the animals then nourish the soil, which in turn nourishes the next season's grasses and grains. Animals on pasture can also harvest their own feed and dispose of their own waste -- all without our help or fossil fuel.

If this system is so sensible, you might ask, why did it succumb to Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, or CAFOs? In fact there is nothing inherently efficient or economical about raising vast cities of animals in confinement. Three struts, each put into place by federal policy, support the modern CAFO, and the most important of these -- the ability to buy grain for less than it costs to grow it -- has just been kicked away. The second strut is F.D.A. approval for the routine use of antibiotics in feed, without which the animals in these places could not survive their crowded, filthy and miserable existence. And the third is that the government does not require CAFOs to treat their wastes as it would require human cities of comparable size to do. The F.D.A. should ban the routine use of antibiotics in livestock feed on public-health grounds, now that we have evidence that the practice is leading to the evolution of drug-resistant bacterial diseases and to outbreaks of E. coli and salmonella poisoning. CAFOs should also be regulated like the factories they are, required to clean up their waste like any other industry or municipality.

It will be argued that moving animals off feedlots and back onto farms will raise the price of meat. It probably will -- as it should. You will need to make the case that paying the real cost of meat, and therefore eating less of it, is a good thing for our health, for the environment, for our dwindling reserves of fresh water and for the welfare of the animals. Meat and milk production represent the food industry's greatest burden on the environment; a recent U.N. study estimated that the world's livestock alone account for 18 percent of all greenhouse gases, more than all forms of transportation combined. (According to one study, a pound of feedlot beef also takes 5,000 gallons of water to produce.) And while animals living on farms will still emit their share of greenhouse gases, grazing them on grass and returning their waste to the soil will substantially offset their carbon hoof prints, as will getting ruminant animals off grain. A bushel of grain takes approximately a half gallon of oil to produce; grass can be grown with little more than sunshine.

It will be argued that sun-food agriculture will generally yield less food than fossil-fuel agriculture. This is debatable. The key question you must be prepared to answer is simply this: Can the sort of sustainable agriculture you're proposing feed the world?

There are a couple of ways to answer this question. The simplest and most honest answer is that we don't know, because we haven't tried. But in the same way we now need to learn how to run an industrial economy without cheap fossil fuel, we have no choice but to find out whether sustainable agriculture can produce enough food. The fact is, during the past century, our agricultural research has been directed toward the goal of maximizing production with the help of fossil fuel. There is no reason to think that bringing the same sort of resources to the development of more complex, sun-based agricultural systems wouldn't produce comparable yields. Today's organic farmers, operating for the most part without benefit of public investment in research, routinely achieve 80 to 100 percent of conventional yields in grain and, in drought years, frequently exceed conventional yields. (This is because organic soils better retain moisture.) Assuming no further improvement, could the world -- with a population expected to peak at 10 billion -- survive on these yields?

First, bear in mind that the average yield of world agriculture today is substantially lower than that of modern sustainable farming. According to a recent University of Michigan study, merely bringing international yields up to today's organic levels could increase the world's food supply by 50 percent.

The second point to bear in mind is that yield isn't everything -- and growing high-yield commodities is not quite the same thing as growing food. Much of what we're growing today is not directly eaten as food but processed into low-quality calories of fat and sugar. As the world epidemic of diet-related chronic disease has demonstrated, the sheer quantity of calories that a food system produces improves health only up to a point, but after that, quality and diversity are probably more important. We can expect that a food system that produces somewhat less food but of a higher quality will produce healthier populations.

The final point to consider is that 40 percent of the world's grain output today is fed to animals; 11 percent of the world's corn and soybean crop is fed to cars and trucks, in the form of biofuels. Provided the developed world can cut its consumption of grain-based animal protein and ethanol, there should be plenty of food for everyone -- however we choose to grow it.

In fact, well-designed polyculture systems, incorporating not just grains but vegetables and animals, can produce more food per acre than conventional monocultures, and food of a much higher nutritional value. But this kind of farming is complicated and needs many more hands on the land to make it work. Farming without fossil fuels -- performing complex rotations of plants and animals and managing pests without petrochemicals -- is labor intensive and takes more skill than merely ""driving and spraying,"" which is how corn-belt farmers describe what they do for a living.

To grow sufficient amounts of food using sunlight will require more people growing food -- millions more. This suggests that sustainable agriculture will be easier to implement in the developing world, where large rural populations remain, than in the West, where they don't. But what about here in America, where we have only about two million farmers left to feed a population of 300 million? And where farmland is being lost to development at the rate of 2,880 acres a day? Post-oil agriculture will need a lot more people engaged in food production -- as farmers and probably also as gardeners.

The sun-food agenda must include programs to train a new generation of farmers and then help put them on the land. The average American farmer today is 55 years old; we shouldn't expect these farmers to embrace the sort of complex ecological approach to agriculture that is called for. Our focus should be on teaching ecological farming systems to students entering land-grant colleges today. For decades now, it has been federal policy to shrink the number of farmers in America by promoting capital-intensive monoculture and consolidation. As a society, we devalued farming as an occupation and encouraged the best students to leave the farm for ""better"" jobs in the city. We emptied America's rural counties in order to supply workers to urban factories. To put it bluntly, we now need to reverse course. We need more highly skilled small farmers in more places all across America -- not as a matter of nostalgia for the agrarian past but as a matter of national security. For nations that lose the ability to substantially feed themselves will find themselves as gravely compromised in their international dealings as nations that depend on foreign sources of oil presently do. But while there are alternatives to oil, there are no alternatives to food.

National security also argues for preserving every acre of farmland we can and then making it available to new farmers. We simply will not be able to depend on distant sources of food, and therefore need to preserve every acre of good farmland within a day's drive of our cities. In the same way that when we came to recognize the supreme ecological value of wetlands we erected high bars to their development, we need to recognize the value of farmland to our national security and require real-estate developers to do ""food-system impact statements"" before development begins. We should also create tax and zoning incentives for developers to incorporate farmland (as they now do ""open space"") in their subdivision plans; all those subdivisions now ringing golf courses could someday have diversified farms at their center.

The revival of farming in America, which of course draws on the abiding cultural power of our agrarian heritage, will pay many political and economic dividends. It will lead to robust economic renewal in the countryside. And it will generate tens of millions of new ""green jobs,"" which is precisely how we need to begin thinking of skilled solar farming: as a vital sector of the 21st-century post-fossil-fuel economy.

<b>II. Re-regionalizing the Food System</b>

For your sun-food agenda to succeed, it will have to do a lot more than alter what happens on the farm. The government could help seed a thousand new polyculture farmers in every county in Iowa, but they would promptly fail if the grain elevator remained the only buyer in town and corn and beans were the only crops it would take. Resolarizing the food system means building the infrastructure for a regional food economy -- one that can support diversified farming and, by shortening the food chain, reduce the amount of fossil fuel in the American diet.

A decentralized food system offers a great many other benefits as well. Food eaten closer to where it is grown will be fresher and require less processing, making it more nutritious. Whatever may be lost in efficiency by localizing food production is gained in resilience: regional food systems can better withstand all kinds of shocks. When a single factory is grinding 20 million hamburger patties in a week or washing 25 million servings of salad, a single terrorist armed with a canister of toxins can, at a stroke, poison millions. Such a system is equally susceptible to accidental contamination: the bigger and more global the trade in food, the more vulnerable the system is to catastrophe. The best way to protect our food system against such threats is obvious: decentralize it.

Today in America there is soaring demand for local and regional food; farmers' markets, of which the U.S.D.A. estimates there are now 4,700, have become one of the fastest-growing segments of the food market. Community-supported agriculture is booming as well: there are now nearly 1,500 community-supported farms, to which consumers pay an annual fee in exchange for a weekly box of produce through the season. The local-food movement will continue to grow with no help from the government, especially as high fuel prices make distant and out-of-season food, as well as feedlot meat, more expensive. Yet there are several steps the government can take to nurture this market and make local foods more affordable. Here are a few:

Four-Season Farmers' Markets. Provide grants to towns and cities to build year-round indoor farmers' markets, on the model of Pike Place in Seattle or the Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia. To supply these markets, the U.S.D.A. should make grants to rebuild local distribution networks in order to minimize the amount of energy used to move produce within local food sheds.

Agricultural Enterprise Zones. Today the revival of local food economies is being hobbled by a tangle of regulations originally designed to check abuses by the very largest food producers. Farmers should be able to smoke a ham and sell it to their neighbors without making a huge investment in federally approved facilities. Food-safety regulations must be made sensitive to scale and marketplace, so that a small producer selling direct off the farm or at a farmers' market is not regulated as onerously as a multinational food manufacturer. This is not because local food won't ever have food-safety problems -- it will -- only that its problems will be less catastrophic and easier to manage because local food is inherently more traceable and accountable.

Local Meat-Inspection Corps. Perhaps the single greatest impediment to the return of livestock to the land and the revival of local, grass-based meat production is the disappearance of regional slaughter facilities. The big meat processors have been buying up local abattoirs only to close them down as they consolidate, and the U.S.D.A. does little to support the ones that remain. From the department's perspective, it is a better use of shrinking resources to dispatch its inspectors to a plant slaughtering 400 head an hour than to a regional abattoir slaughtering a dozen. The U.S.D.A. should establish a Local Meat-Inspectors Corps to serve these processors. Expanding on its successful pilot program on Lopez Island in Puget Sound, the U.S.D.A. should also introduce a fleet of mobile abattoirs that would go from farm to farm, processing animals humanely and inexpensively. Nothing would do more to make regional, grass-fed meat fully competitive in the market with feedlot meat.

Establish a Strategic Grain Reserve. In the same way the shift to alternative energy depends on keeping oil prices relatively stable, the sun-food agenda -- as well as the food security of billions of people around the world -- will benefit from government action to prevent huge swings in commodity prices. A strategic grain reserve, modeled on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, would help achieve this objective and at the same time provide some cushion for world food stocks, which today stand at perilously low levels. Governments should buy and store grain when it is cheap and sell when it is dear, thereby moderating price swings in both directions and discouraging speculation.

Regionalize Federal Food Procurement. In the same way that federal procurement is often used to advance important social goals (like promoting minority-owned businesses), we should require that some minimum percentage of government food purchases -- whether for school-lunch programs, military bases or federal prisons -- go to producers located within 100 miles of institutions buying the food. We should create incentives for hospitals and universities receiving federal funds to buy fresh local produce. To channel even a small portion of institutional food purchasing to local food would vastly expand regional agriculture and improve the diet of the millions of people these institutions feed.

Create a Federal Definition of ""Food."" It makes no sense for government food-assistance dollars, intended to improve the nutritional health of at-risk Americans, to support the consumption of products we know to be unhealthful. Yes, some people will object that for the government to specify what food stamps can and cannot buy smacks of paternalism. Yet we already prohibit the purchase of tobacco and alcohol with food stamps. So why not prohibit something like soda, which is arguably less nutritious than red wine? Because it is, nominally, a food, albeit a ""junk food."" We need to stop flattering nutritionally worthless foodlike substances by calling them ""junk food"" -- and instead make clear that such products are not in fact food of any kind. Defining what constitutes real food worthy of federal support will no doubt be controversial (you'll recall President Reagan's ketchup imbroglio), but defining food upward may be more politically palatable than defining it down, as Reagan sought to do. One approach would be to rule that, in order to be regarded as a food by the government, an edible substance must contain a certain minimum ratio of micronutrients per calorie of energy. At a stroke, such a definition would improve the quality of school lunch and discourage sales of unhealthful products, since typically only ""food"" is exempt from local sales tax.

A few other ideas: Food-stamp debit cards should double in value whenever swiped at a farmers' markets -- all of which, by the way, need to be equipped with the Electronic Benefit Transfer card readers that supermarkets already have. We should expand the WIC program that gives farmers'-market vouchers to low-income women with children; such programs help attract farmers' markets to urban neighborhoods where access to fresh produce is often nonexistent. (We should also offer tax incentives to grocery chains willing to build supermarkets in underserved neighborhoods.) Federal food assistance for the elderly should build on a successful program pioneered by the state of Maine that buys low-income seniors a membership in a community-supported farm. All these initiatives have the virtue of advancing two objectives at once: supporting the health of at-risk Americans and the revival of local food economies.

<b>III. Rebuilding America's Food Culture</b>

In the end, shifting the American diet from a foundation of imported fossil fuel to local sunshine will require changes in our daily lives, which by now are deeply implicated in the economy and culture of fast, cheap and easy food. Making available more healthful and more sustainable food does not guarantee it will be eaten, much less appreciated or enjoyed. We need to use all the tools at our disposal -- not just federal policy and public education but the president's bully pulpit and the example of the first family's own dinner table -- to promote a new culture of food that can undergird your sun-food agenda.

Changing the food culture must begin with our children, and it must begin in the schools. Nearly a half-century ago, President Kennedy announced a national initiative to improve the physical fitness of American children. He did it by elevating the importance of physical education, pressing states to make it a requirement in public schools. We need to bring the same commitment to ""edible education"" -- in Alice Waters's phrase -- by making lunch, in all its dimensions, a mandatory part of the curriculum. On the premise that eating well is a critically important life skill, we need to teach all primary-school students the basics of growing and cooking food and then enjoying it at shared meals.

To change our children's food culture, we'll need to plant gardens in every primary school, build fully equipped kitchens, train a new generation of lunchroom ladies (and gentlemen) who can once again cook and teach cooking to children. We should introduce a School Lunch Corps program that forgives federal student loans to culinary-school graduates in exchange for two years of service in the public-school lunch program. And we should immediately increase school-lunch spending per pupil by $1 a day -- the minimum amount food-service experts believe it will take to underwrite a shift from fast food in the cafeteria to real food freshly prepared.

But it is not only our children who stand to benefit from public education about food. Today most federal messages about food, from nutrition labeling to the food pyramid, are negotiated with the food industry. The surgeon general should take over from the Department of Agriculture the job of communicating with Americans about their diet. That way we might begin to construct a less equivocal and more effective public-health message about nutrition. Indeed, there is no reason that public-health campaigns about the dangers of obesity and Type 2 diabetes shouldn't be as tough and as effective as public-health campaigns about the dangers of smoking. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that one in three American children born in 2000 will develop Type 2 diabetes. The public needs to know and see precisely what that sentence means: blindness; amputation; early death. All of which can be avoided by a change in diet and lifestyle. A public-health crisis of this magnitude calls for a blunt public-health message, even at the expense of offending the food industry. Judging by the success of recent antismoking campaigns, the savings to the health care system could be substantial.

There are other kinds of information about food that the government can supply or demand. In general we should push for as much transparency in the food system as possible -- the other sense in which ""sunlight"" should be the watchword of our agenda. The F.D.A. should require that every packaged-food product include a second calorie count, indicating how many calories of fossil fuel went into its production. Oil is one of the most important ingredients in our food, and people ought to know just how much of it they're eating. The government should also throw its support behind putting a second bar code on all food products that, when scanned either in the store or at home (or with a cellphone), brings up on a screen the whole story and pictures of how that product was produced: in the case of crops, images of the farm and lists of agrochemicals used in its production; in the case of meat and dairy, descriptions of the animals' diet and drug regimen, as well as live video feeds of the CAFO where they live and, yes, the slaughterhouse where they die. The very length and complexity of the modern food chain breeds a culture of ignorance and indifference among eaters. Shortening the food chain is one way to create more conscious consumers, but deploying technology to pierce the veil is another.

Finally, there is the power of the example you set in the White House. If what's needed is a change of culture in America's thinking about food, then how America's first household organizes its eating will set the national tone, focusing the light of public attention on the issue and communicating a simple set of values that can guide Americans toward sun-based foods and away from eating oil.

The choice of White House chef is always closely watched, and you would be wise to appoint a figure who is identified with the food movement and committed to cooking simply from fresh local ingredients. Besides feeding you and your family exceptionally well, such a chef would demonstrate how it is possible even in Washington to eat locally for much of the year, and that good food needn't be fussy or complicated but does depend on good farming. You should make a point of the fact that every night you're in town, you join your family for dinner in the Executive Residence -- at a table. (Surely you remember the Reagans' TV trays.) And you should also let it be known that the White House observes one meatless day a week -- a step that, if all Americans followed suit, would be the equivalent, in carbon saved, of taking 20 million midsize sedans off the road for a year. Let the White House chef post daily menus on the Web, listing the farmers who supplied the food, as well as recipes.

Since enhancing the prestige of farming as an occupation is critical to developing the sun-based regional agriculture we need, the White House should appoint, in addition to a White House chef, a White House farmer. This new post would be charged with implementing what could turn out to be your most symbolically resonant step in building a new American food culture. And that is this: tear out five prime south-facing acres of the White House lawn and plant in their place an organic fruit and vegetable garden.

When Eleanor Roosevelt did something similar in 1943, she helped start a Victory Garden movement that ended up making a substantial contribution to feeding the nation in wartime. (Less well known is the fact that Roosevelt planted this garden over the objections of the U.S.D.A., which feared home gardening would hurt the American food industry.) By the end of the war, more than 20 million home gardens were supplying 40 percent of the produce consumed in America. The president should throw his support behind a new Victory Garden movement, this one seeking ""victory"" over three critical challenges we face today: high food prices, poor diets and a sedentary population. Eating from this, the shortest food chain of all, offers anyone with a patch of land a way to reduce their fossil-fuel consumption and help fight climate change. (We should offer grants to cities to build allotment gardens for people without access to land.) Just as important, Victory Gardens offer a way to enlist Americans, in body as well as mind, in the work of feeding themselves and changing the food system -- something more ennobling, surely, than merely asking them to shop a little differently.

I don't need to tell you that ripping out even a section of the White House lawn will be controversial: Americans love their lawns, and the South Lawn is one of the most beautiful in the country. But imagine all the energy, water and petrochemicals it takes to make it that way. (Even for the purposes of this memo, the White House would not disclose its lawn-care regimen.) Yet as deeply as Americans feel about their lawns, the agrarian ideal runs deeper still, and making this particular plot of American land productive, especially if the First Family gets out there and pulls weeds now and again, will provide an image even more stirring than that of a pretty lawn: the image of stewardship of the land, of self-reliance and of making the most of local sunlight to feed one's family and community. The fact that surplus produce from the South Lawn Victory Garden (and there will be literally tons of it) will be offered to regional food banks will make its own eloquent statement.

You're probably thinking that growing and eating organic food in the White House carries a certain political risk. It is true you might want to plant iceberg lettuce rather than arugula, at least to start. (Or simply call arugula by its proper American name, as generations of Midwesterners have done: ""rocket."") But it should not be difficult to deflect the charge of elitism sometimes leveled at the sustainable-food movement. Reforming the food system is not inherently a right-or-left issue: for every Whole Foods shopper with roots in the counterculture you can find a family of evangelicals intent on taking control of its family dinner and diet back from the fast-food industry -- the culinary equivalent of home schooling. You should support hunting as a particularly sustainable way to eat meat -- meat grown without any fossil fuels whatsoever. There is also a strong libertarian component to the sun-food agenda, which seeks to free small producers from the burden of government regulation in order to stoke rural innovation. And what is a higher ""family value,"" after all, than making time to sit down every night to a shared meal?

Our agenda puts the interests of America's farmers, families and communities ahead of the fast-food industry's. For that industry and its apologists to imply that it is somehow more ""populist"" or egalitarian to hand our food dollars to Burger King or General Mills than to support a struggling local farmer is absurd. Yes, sun food costs more, but the reasons why it does only undercut the charge of elitism: cheap food is only cheap because of government handouts and regulatory indulgence (both of which we will end), not to mention the exploitation of workers, animals and the environment on which its putative ""economies"" depend. Cheap food is food dishonestly priced -- it is in fact unconscionably expensive.

Your sun-food agenda promises to win support across the aisle. It builds on America's agrarian past, but turns it toward a more sustainable, sophisticated future. It honors the work of American farmers and enlists them in three of the 21st century's most urgent errands: to move into the post-oil era, to improve the health of the American people and to mitigate climate change. Indeed, it enlists all of us in this great cause by turning food consumers into part-time producers, reconnecting the American people with the American land and demonstrating that we need not choose between the welfare of our families and the health of the environment -- that eating less oil and more sunlight will redound to the benefit of both.</lj-cut>"

about three weeks ago, on a gloriously sunny friday lunch hour, i impulsively bought a flat of herb starts and a flat of veggie starts at planters.  and they've been sitting on trays in front of our west-facing french doors ever since, waiting to be planted.  and i just added some more veggie starts which i bought at the independence expo yesterday.  all are patiently waiting, and i'm praying that they don't get too root-bound before i can get them safely in the ground.

around the same time, i ordered a 50/50 mixture of compost/topsoil from <a href=""http://www.missouriorganic.com/"">missouri organic</a>, which was delivered on 3/31.  15 cubic yards.  took up the entire driveway (and a little of the neighbors', despite the driver's best efforts, but chris cleaned that up right away).

<center><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3456/3404520890_7a236f5f63.jpg?v=0"" /></center>

spent all of that evening working with chris to get the raised veggie beds he'd built the previous saturday...

<center><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3565/3378476051_2836f5575d.jpg?v=0"" /></center>

...filled in.  (4 wheelbarrows of dirt, pushed by chris mostly uphill from the pile in the driveway cleeeeeear around to the very back of our property, for each one -- the man is a wonder to me -- my job was to rake it out evenly, break up the clods, tamp it down a bit.)  

<center><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3456/3404520764_2082065718.jpg?v=0"" /></center>

we finished that up after dark had fallen, and moved more dirt from the neighbor's driveway-side of the pile into the front terraced rock beds we'd built last summer (and which i'd attempted to ""lasagna garden"" over the fall/winter with layers of peat moss, newspaper, and coffee grounds, but no dirt because i ran out of money, so all the dirt's getting added at the end -- oops) so that we could cover the pile cleanly with our enormous, bright blue tarp, then collapsed into bed after well-deserved hot showers.  

the next evening, since we didn't have the beds built yet for the bean trellis and raspberries, we worked on the front yard.  chris continued adding dirt to the terraced rock beds.

<i>(chris building the terrace beds last summer)</i></center>

these beds will host shade-loving plants (coleus, hostas, etc.) for the duration of the hot months, but next year i'll be starting cabbages, lettuces, broccolis, and things of that sort to plant in them so we can harvest them before the trees leaf out.  got too late a start for all that this year, though the locust trees on the east-facing ""hell strip"" on our property are late-leafers, so i may yet experiment with some lettuces and cabbages in those beds anyway.  

<center><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3586/3403709893_e37da8cf0a.jpg?v=0"" /></center>

and i forked up the soon-to-be herb bed...

...leaving the bordering ivy and grasses, and the two boxwoods (which will likely be moved out of that bed), but ran out of back power and sunlight before i could add in any of the new dirt/compost.  and now it's rained and gotten cold again (and will likely snow a bit tonight), compacting it all back down so that i'll have to do it all over again.  *sigh*  but i got the three roses moved to the bed along the driveway; hopefully they'll like their new home.  they're not going to get as big as i'd originally thought when i first planted them as foundation ornamentals, so that wasn't a good use of them -- plus, who wants to be harvesting herbs around prickly roses?  (although i'll definitely be harvesting their hips later this summer!)  

half the dirt pile is still waiting in the driveway, covered in the bright-blue tarp (currently straining and flapping in 40-mph gusts of cold north wind), for the weather to turn so we can get it placed in the new bed spots in the yard.  but first we have to build the beds in which to place it -- and that will require some building with the remaining fir boards we bought as well as fetching more rock from shawnee, all of which takes time, energy, and good weather.  oy!"

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d-hTyo1eAg"">this documentary</a> (largely in german, with subtitles) was recommended to me by a homesteading-minded acquaintance. i just watched the entire thing (it's divided into 10 10-minute segments) and it's truly horrifying. the movie highlights all the reasons why our globe's conventional food system has gone awry -- from starving people in brazil while using the majority of farmland to grow soya for export to europe, to causing traditional farmers to move to planting GM, hybrid seeds because they can't make enough to live on by growing better-tasting heirlooms (thanks to governmental shenanigans with subsidies), to the unbearably callous treatment of the living, breathing animals raised to feed those folks in the world with already more food than they can eat, to the destructive effects of industrial-scale fishing not only on the oceans but also on families of fishers and their collective hard-earned wisdom passed down through the generations, to the creepy apparent brainwashing of corporate CEOs that the only important thing they should consider is profit, no matter the consequences, even to the extent of privatizing water (yes, <i>water</i>).  and on and on...

it makes me all the more glad to be working so hard to embrace and support locally-, sustainably-, and humanely-produced foods raised by good-hearted people who i'm happier to know every day.  please take the time to watch even a part of the documentary; it's important that we all become more aware of the effects of our choices, even on people we'll likely never meet.  it all comes back around.

"event","a friend of mine commented on a previous post that he would like to find out more about how to obtain local meat, which groceries participate in the sale of local meat, and how he can work the cost of local meat into his family's food budget.  i apologize for taking so long on responding to this request, but as i'm rather new to the meat-buying (and food-budgeting, for that matter) myself, i wanted to give his request some thought.  

i'll take the easiest questions first.  

the best way to find producers of meat here in kansas city is through the <b>KANSAS CITY FOOD CIRCLE</b>'s directory -- you can either download a PDF of their directory (they're printed every spring in time for the annual farmers' expos), or go to their online directory <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/KCFC-Bulletin-Board/web/200x---kcfc-grower-links?pli=1"">here</a>.  there are a lot of meat producers there, with descriptions of where they are, what they raise, how it's raised, how they market it, and their contact information's there too.  some are more web-savvy than others, but all are worth looking into, meeting at farmers' markets, calling, etc.  in order to be a food circle member, farmers have to agree to sign the KCFC's pledge, which you can read <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/KCFC-Bulletin-Board/web/2008-kcfc-grower-pledges"">here</a>.  the pledge is important to note because it provides consistency and a statement of responsibility by the farmer.  

you can also find meat producers through <b>LOCAL HARVEST</b>'s website <a href=""http://www.localharvest.org/search.jsp?map=1&lat=39.105634&lon=-94.518958&scale=8&ty=0&zip=64105"">here</a>, but they're not held to any of the standards which the food circle requires, so eaters have to be that much more attentive and cautious.  

you can currently meet the following meat producers every friday evening at the <a href=""http://www.badseedfarm.com/"">BADSEED</a> winter farmers' market (through early march, i'm told, which is when the regular-season market begins): kim wells of <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/KCFC-Bulletin-Board/web/kcfcmg---wells-family-farms"">wells family farms</a> (grass-fed beef), sarah burnett of <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/KCFC-Bulletin-Board/web/kcfcmg---burnetts-heritage-farms"">burnett's heritage farm</a> (free-range chicken (and eggs), turkey, and pork), and sarah hoffmann of <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/KCFC-Bulletin-Board/web/kcfcmg---green-dirt-farm"">green dirt farm</a> (grass-fed lamb and sheep dairy).  it's a great farmers' market with not only these producers but also fresh bakery products, local honey, fair-trade coffee for sale, and more.  plus, it's indoors!  

during the spring/summer/autumn farmers' market season, there are various meat producers to be found at the ever-expanding organic farmers' markets, information about some of which can be found <a href=""http://www.kcfoodcircle.org/docs/directory-text.html#FeaturedFarmersMarkets"">here</a>.  

as far as grocery stores which support local meat producers, the name i've heard the most is <a href=""http://www.henhouse.com/cnt/BFBL_Homepage.html"">hen house</a>.  (green dirt farm just signed on with them, in fact -- just ask for their meat by name.)  they've not only got local producers as vendors but also run a quite-popular CSA (see the link for more info).  that said, i can't encourage you enough to go to your usual grocery store and <i>pester them regularly</i> to get their meats and produce from local producers.  besides the fact that the squeaky wheel gets the grease, other grocery chains certainly don't want to miss out on the great market that hen house is cornering by providing local foods to increasingly-enthusiastic and vocal consumers.  let them know that the interest -- nay, the <i>demand</i> -- is there, and watch them scamper to catch up!  

with regard to wrapping local meat (or local produce for that matter) into your family's food budget, my first and foremost recommendation is to <b>GROW YOUR OWN</b> as much as possible.  it's invaluable for both adults and children as education, playtime, exercise, and the general sense of well-being that comes with knowing that you're controlling to some extent the quality of what your family needs to survive.  past that, focus your grocery shopping on <b>WHOLE FOODS</b> (grains, beans, and produce) and cut out the processed foods altogether (except, of course, for some things like pastas).  it's pretty much guaranteed that you can cook up a better chip/doughnut/candy/pastry/cracker than any additive-laden box o' crap that lines the grocery shelves, including those touted as ""organic,"" ""healthy,"" etc.  <b>BUY STAPLES</b> in bulk and learn how to cook with them.  (one good way to do that is to join the growing <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/SquashBlossomKC"">squash blossom food buying club</a>, which obtains organic foods in large quantities so that its members can get items in bulk quantities and save money in the process.  especially helpful during the lean winter/early spring months.)  <b>PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S IN SEASON</b> and buy those items in large quantities.  <b>EAT LESS MEAT</b>, or learn how to make that meat last through several meals -- i read recently of how one family stretched one chicken through five (4!) meals by using every last bit of it creatively, including eating some of the organs (which are quite good for you, provided they come from an organically-raised, free-range animal) and making broth from the bones, which can be used immediately or saved for future stews/sauces.  

finally, another way to obtain locally-produced meat is through <b>MEMBERSHIP IN A CSA</b>.  i'm the director of the <a href=""www.kc-csac.org"">KANSAS CITY CSA COALITION</a>; feel free to use the ""contact us"" page on the CSAC's website if you have any questions.  we're currently working on updating our records and the website for the 2009 season, but for the moment i can tell you that 2009 will be the second year for <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/KCFC-Bulletin-Board/web/kcfcmg---parker-farms-natural-meats"">parker farms</a>'s meat CSA (a wonderful family, about whose meat i've heard only the best and about whose eggs i can testify personally as extremely good), and wells family farms (see link above) is considering putting together a meat CSA.  i'm also in the process of working out a produce-and-meat CSA with a group of amish farmers in north missouri, so please let me know if you'd be interested in participating in that (especially those folks living in the northland).  

i'll share more as i learn more, but that's a start for now.  i hope it helps, and i hope the increasingly-easy availability of information about our local food producers makes getting your food locally less intimidating.  know at the very least that i'll be here to encourage you along every step of the way.  :)

"event","i really like the fact that he didn't spend any of the half-hour mentioning mccain.  instead, he outlined the plans he actually has for this country.  you don't get that approach from mccain, even in his stump speeches; only obama-bashing from every angle.  pathetic.  

when his collar's unbuttoned, sans tie and jacket, he's being ""personal"" and letting us see ""the real him"".  :D

the determination and fire in his eyes when he talks about the circumstances of his mother's death is incredibly touching and inspiring; one doesn't usually come across such fire exhibited by american politicians.  

regarding his potential handling of red-button issues, i DEFINITELY trust his temperament more than mccain's.  obama appears to approach the world as a listener, a diplomat.  mccain appears to see the world through the eyes of a victim, the eyes of someone who was horribly wronged and needs revenge, no matter the cost.  everyone's mccain's enemy and he's too likely to overreact at the slightest perceived wrong.  

the photos are really quite good.

overall, the production was amazing, and, as chris said, that's coming from the world's most cynical person.  given the fact that nobody better or ""purer"" will have a chance at winning the presidency.....

today, the fall equinox, i am turning 29.  i've been doing a lot of pondering about the significance of this year in my life (or the significance which i can give to this year).  and i've come to the conclusion that this year will be one of focused learning, preparation, and planning for a new stage in my life.  i'm going to spend the next year learning, in an organized manner, how to (1) grow my own food, (2) harvest, store, and preserve that food, (3) make preparations for bringing animals (read: a couple of chickens) onto my property, and (4) figure out a way to get the two schools which bookend my house to let me use their land for organic subsistence gardening.

yesterday he built a new door for the deck, so we could <i>finally</i> take down the weather-tortured doggie gate.  it looks so nice, and even has spring-loaded hinges so it closes itself, and a gate latch so it stays shut and we can padlock it if we want.  see?

work is iNSANE.  will have nearly 30 hours of overtime on this paycheque.  and no end in sight; just more pouring in.

leak in kitchen ceiling appears to have been fixed, though the damage to the ceiling has not yet been repaired.  waiting for the next fierce deluge to occur to prove the fix before patching all up.  oy.

basement stinkier than ever, and still hasn't dried out enough to paint with dry-loc.  going to have to buy a humidifier.  probably with my massive paycheque this weekend.  

after the dryer stopped working and started making a smell like burning electrics, we bought a new washer and dryer off of craigslist.  got snookered by the guy on the price (he made about $75 off of us, as was proven by the receipt he passed on to us for the remaining warranty), but they're so QUIET and work so WELL that we kinda don't mind.

i've been insanely busy lately, working overtime at work (LOTS of litigation and discovery going on, which i have to keep organized; we've reached the point where nobody's allowed to touch <i>anything</i> on my desk for fear they'll screw up the piles of mid-project organizing i've got which keep getting interrupted by other, more immediate tasks).  i've also been ramping up my work on the CSAC -- lots of website revisions (thanks to my dahlink christopher, my web guru), and i'm going to start scheduling actual farm visits soon so that i can get to know the farmers, their operations, their issues, their products better.  wheee!  i sure hope we get this grant money soon so i can get reimbursed for the gas i'll be burning up!  

my parents are outstripping me in their green-ness: they're building a composter in their backyard out of wire mesh and wooden studs.  they just throw any scraps into a bowl they keep on the kitchen counter, and then toss it on the pile out back.  i'm so proud of them!!  now i gotta play catch-up.  :)  

i'm trying to figure out a way to present my idea of gardening in the elementary schoolyard behind my house.  it's just begging for some raised beds, and i think it would be FABULOUS to give some lessons to the kids (some of whom come from less-moneyed neighborhoods than mine) on real food -- planting, growing, harvesting, preparing, and eating it.  it'd be a fantastic way to encourage community gardening, too -- as the marketers say, the best way to influence parents' habits is through their kids!  why not influence them in a positive manner for once?  :)  so i'm working on that, too.

two weeks ago, chris and i received the rest of our new dining set:
<center><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3121/2588611255_97c235afbd.jpg?v=0"" /></center>
from the people in topeka who'd listed it on craigslist.  it's an ethan allen set, in maple, and the new chairs are exactly the same as the ones we already had (you can see the old ones in the rear of the photo) except for that their backs are windsor-shaped and the old ones have that curvy-topped bar across the top of the back.  and the old dining room set (also ethan allen, from the late '70s) is made of pine, with a mahogany finish.  it was a great deal, and we're considering stripping all the chairs (new and old) and the table legs and re-staining them black (i've been advised that painting them will completely devalue them (EA chairs sell for around $350 - $400 APIECE), and considering that it's all very expensive, well-made furniture and still worth quite a bit of money (despite the great price we got on the new set), we'll be doing what we can to maintain its value and take care of the wood), so they'll all go together in a mixy-matchy way.  kind of going for this look:
<center><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3059/2613653628_79914e078a.jpg?v=0"" /></center>
but we haven't made up our minds yet, so the old chairs are hanging out in the basement for now.  ;)  

also, last week we bought a new sofa (another craigslist find) from a super-nice, teeny little japanese girl who's moving back to japan and selling all of her furniture.

(that's misha peeking over the ottoman in the first pic, and both sophie and misha in the second one)
it's really a nice piece of furniture, and chris vouches heartily for its level of comfortableness (he's been spending more time on that couch than the old one!).  i'm going to refinish the wood because it's scraped and scuffed in several places, and then reupholster the sofa with the fabric that's been sitting in the corner of the dining room for nearly a year.  exciting!  as chris said, if i'm going to experiment with reupholstering something, a $70 sofa is a good place to start.  :D

finally, i also decided to make a door of sorts for the ""doggie cabinet"" in the kitchen.  it's a little cubbyhole cut into the back of the cabinets which form the base of the breakfast bar, where we store the dogs' food &etc.  i originally wanted to find a really cool reclaimed floor grate to make into a door, but couldn't ever find one of the right size, so i made a curtain-door out of swing-arm rods and a curtain i made from the kitchen drapery fabric.  i think it turned out pretty well!

5.68 miles of quite-hilly streets in 45 minutes (6:30 - 7:15 pm).  the only part i had to walk was the top half of the hill on main (from 27th street to 30th) and the 53rd street hill which i'd never encountered before and i swear has GOT to be a 60-degree incline.  that hurt (i actually had to stop halfway up the hill to catch my breath, with the neighbors looking on curiously at the weird girl gasping and crawling her way up their hill).  but i got home in time to see my mom & stepdad, who had dropped by to drop off our tickets to friday night's royals game!  *pats self on back*  
<hr>
the second one was my first close encounter with, and catching of, a bat.  my next door neighbor, who hadn't yet turned on her a/c because of a contest she's been having with a coworker to see who could endure kansas city's horrible hot humidity the longest, has been opening all her windows and doors in the evenings to catch whatever breeze might be about.  unfortunately, the series of french doors which open onto her front patio don't have screens.  so last night, a bat decided to come visit.  over she trotted around 9/9:30 last evening, all wrapped up in a sheet like mother teresa, broom in hand (her mom had told her to cover herself with a sheet and shoo the bat out of the house with a broom, though she didn't see how that could be much use), asking whether either chris or i knew how to catch a bat.  she looked hilarious.  and her partner and son were hiding in their screened-in porch at the back of the house, making <i>her</i> catch it all by herself!  well, i wasn't having that, so i grabbed my broom and returned next door with her.  after a room-by-room check and shutting doors behind us, we discovered the small brown bat (he wasn't even very ugly!) hanging upside-down, wings folded neatly at his sides, on the door of the farthest-back bedroom upstairs.  i said, ""okay...i'm going to sneak up on it and try and throw this sheet over it to catch it!""  she said okay, she'd be my backup.  so i tiptoed up to the doorway, with the bat watching my every move, its eyes darting to and fro, its little head twitching, and just as i was about to toss the sheet, it <i>flew at me!</i>  we both screamed bloody murder and i threw the sheet.  and i caught it!  it fell to the floor, squeaking madly and fluttering wildly under the far side of the rumpled sheet.  corey quickly gathered the whole mess up and ran it outside (she decided to leave the sheet out there for a while to give the bat a chance to recover and remove itself from the area), where their cat was waiting patiently (haha)."

"event","As my friend Brian said, this is yet another reason why my presidential vote will NOT be going to John McCain this year: according to <a href=""http://www.sierraclub.org/pressroom/releases/pr2008-02-21.asp"">a press release by the Sierra Club</a>, McCain ""was the only member of Congress to skip every single crucial environmental vote scored by the organization, posting a score lower than Members of Congress who were out for much of the year due to serious illnesses--and even lower than some who died during the term. By contrast, the average Member of Congress scored a 53 in 2007. McCain posts a lifetime score of only 24.""

From Carl Pope's (the Sierra Club's Executive Director) statement, ""Out of 535 Members of Congress, John McCain is the only one who chose to miss every single key environmental vote scored by the League of Conservation Voters [""LCV""] last year. When it came time to stand up and vote for the environment, John McCain was nowhere to be found.  Every other Member who received a zero from LCV last year at least had the temerity to show up and vote against the environment and clean energy time after time. And unlike John McCain, I doubt any of them would claim to be environmental leaders or champions on global warming.""

He didn't bother to vote even when his own constituents (Arizona) are to be affected by the proposed legislation:
""McCain missed votes to save his constituents $499 million dollars at the pump and at least $550 million on their energy bills, while creating more than 10,000 new clean energy jobs in his home state.""  Not to mention the fact that ""two weeks ago . . . John McCain was the only Senator who chose to skip a crucial vote on the future of clean energy in America -- dooming the measure to fail by just a single vote.""

Pathetic.  I choose Barack Obama.

On the topic of home gardening v. the giant corporate agribusiness culture in which the USA is ensnared, I really liked <a href=""http://www.gardenrant.com/my_weblog/2008/06/why-economic--1.html"">Michele Owens' post today, entitled ""Attacking Kitchen Gardening on Grounds of Inefficiency Is Huge Waste of Time,"" on the blog ""Garden Rant""</a>.  Referencing a <a href=""http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/09/do-we-really-need-a-few-billion-locavores/"">post made by Stephen J. Dubner</a> on the New York Times' Freakonomics column, Michele criticizes Dubner's argument as being flawed because ""(1) It assumes an equivalence between homegrown produce and industrial produce when there is none,"" and ""(2) The argument assumes that extreme specialization is the ideal way to organize human society.""  I'll leave it to my readers to follow the links and decide for yourselves who is right, but I have to say that I tend to agree with Michele.  It is important to know how to care for oneself in a variety of ways, including being able to grow one's own food, in order that as the times shift and economies rise and fall, one is not left in the societal lurch.  

Her argument goes right in line with my current, and planned, endeavors -- learning gardening, canning, preserving (""foodcraft""); learning herbal medicine and self-healing remedies; learning how to design and sew clothing, decor, etc. (""clothcraft""); learning how to build and maintain things; learning how to sell anything i make (micro-economics); etc.  i don't really expect to become an expert in any one thing, but i figure that as long as i know enough to get by with in all these topics (and more), i'll be able to make my way through the world and make a good life for myself.  I won't have to depend on any uncaring corporation, government, or faceless entity of any kind to live.  

THAT's the american dream, in my opinion -- the ability, and the freedom, to be self-sufficient and live one's own life."

"event","my stepbrother's house (he lives in wichita) was broken into tuesday evening.  he was home when it happened.  apparently the intruder broke through a window to get in, and stewart heard him and went for his old shotgun.  the guy either heard stew in the house or saw the shotgun, i'm not sure, and ran away.  so nothing was taken and nobody was hurt, but still...dealing with the anxiety of having one's supposedly safe haven breached has got to mess one up.  i know it would me...  

when we first bought our house, the sellers had had an ADT security system sign in the front garden bed.  i took it down at the time, saying that it was unnecessary while the house was full of gaping holes and missing walls, and i do believe to some extent that buying into such things only draws negative energy and situations towards one (i used to keep an old boyfriend's vicious-looking folding knife under my car seat ""for protection,"" ""just in case,"" until i finally admitted to myself that the thought of it being there and possibly even being used against me freaked me out too much entirely, and i felt too much of a psychic vibration of danger and evil with it in the car, and i got rid of it).

in other news, we're having ANOTHER big thunderstorm right now.  the tornado sirens have been wailing for over half an hour now.  if k-state in manhattan hadn't been hit so hard last night/early this morning (sophie woke us up at 4 a.m. when that storm hit us -- though <i>i</i> thought this morning's storm was rather soothing.  gentle thunder which sounded like the ocean, and a constant patter of rain on the roof.  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...), and another town in kansas nearly wiped off the map (or so i've heard) as well, i'd probably go to sleep.  as it is, i took three sominex an hour ago and they've not kicked in yet (although the doggies' sedatives seem to be doing a good job on them).  am becoming convinced that sominex (and sleeping pills in general) are not worth the boxes which contain them.  hrmph.  

...unless a drastic increase in typos means that the drugs are working.  loss of brain-hand coordination, anyone?  

welp, guess i'll go back to reading now, and waiting to fall asleep.  wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<hr>
the lightning's gotten brighter, more spastic.  the wind's really starting to gust now, hurling bits of the trees at our house.  there's supposed to be large hail with this storm -- good thing i don't have a delicate car which would be troubled in any way by mere hail.  the thunder is louder; i can feel it vibrate my head through the stacked-up pillows, through the headboard, through the wall.  sophie's in her box, trying to dig her way to china.  better through that than through the bathroom rugs, strewing little carpet v's everywhere.  oy.  must go watch the storm now."

(i'd create the false wainscoting with mdf, 1""x3"" boards, 1""x6"" boards for the shelf, with decorative trim and brackets) stuff like these plates here, by thomas paul:

(the chalkboard paint works wonderfully, btw; finally got some chalk and tried it out this weekend.)

i also really like the idea of creating silhouettes of people who are near and dear to me (perhaps i'll have them sign and date the backs of their individual silhouette), and hanging a collection of those on the wall somewhere.  perhaps in the dining room, since that will be the gathering place for large family events.  now i'll just have to figure out how to do that.  :)

late this morning, chris and i took the doggies to the park.  gloriously sunny, it was windy enough to make me wear a baseball cap.  i thought perhaps the wind would be cause for a long-sleeved layer, but no!  it was warm enough that, had the wind not been gusting at ~100mph, it would've been downright HOT.  

the park was full of people, kids, and doggies.  some fed the migrating geese, climbed trees, a couple guys were practicing their metal-detecting skillz, some folks played frisbee (or catch with their dogs) in the open areas...

"event","chris and i had dinner at <a href=""http://www.kansascitymenus.com/1924main/"">1924 main</a> last evening to celebrate our 5th anniversary since the night we met, and it was FANTABULOUS.  for those who don't know, 1924 is a restaurant that offers a menu that changes monthly, so that they can focus on what's fresh, seasonal, and hopefully locally-obtainable.  there are three courses, and you can choose to either go with the wine pairings (nearly doubles the cost of the dinner) or without.  for us veggies, they're wonderfully open-minded and creative.  and seriously, everything was so heavenly that literally, with every bite, we were making oddly orgasmic-reminiscent noises of delight and surprise.  i kinda felt like one of the judges on ""iron chef"" with the way i was trying to get the flavor of every ingredient on the plate into each forkful, and follow each forkful with a sip of wine to see how the flavors blended and danced.  

<lj-cut text=""photos and a description of our dinner"">
one side of our dining room:
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2211/2168634661_21579b7243.jpg?v=0"" />
it was funny -- when we arrived, we were shown into this side dining room of which we were the only diners.  we got a lovely table by the window, so we got to enjoy watching all the first-friday-goers (always an interesting crowd) meandering up and down the street.  

the appetite-whetting bread served was a crusty rustic biscuit with a spongy interior served with the best honey butter in the universe.  NUM.  

my first course was a long and narrow plate of grilled radicchio mixed with chunks of roquefort, slender pear slices (lightly cooked), and a fig-mustard vinaigrette.  (it was supposed to come with prosciutto, but i think it was perfect without it.)  it was perfectly paired with a red zin.  chris's first course was the goat cheese ravioli sprinkled with braised lamb and candied fennel, all doused in a light stewed tomato & rosemary gremolata.  his wine pairing was a lovely cotes du rhone.  

the main course was the showstopper.  my plate contained a wee tower of three ""potato rosti"" (basically palm-sized cakes of grated potatoes, sauteed) served alongside the most amazing example of oyster mushrooms i've ever come across, seared so that they were ever so slightly crisped but retaining all of their divine juices, with a sauce of melted leeks and truffle oil.  i literally mopped up every last drop.  *happy sigh*  it was supposed to be accompanied by some diver scallops, which i can understand would be a fine complement, but i was more than thrilled with the version i got!  the wine was a two-year-old chardonnay from carneros.  chris had a ribeye steak that had been pounded flat, served atop garlic potatoes and pancetta-creamed chard.  to the side were the most mouth-melting fried green tomatoes in existence.  and finishing the look was a drizzling of cabernet sauce.  his wine pairing was a napa valley cabernet.  

i totally intended to photograph each course, but the food was so good that i completely forgot.  :)  so all you get is a photo of dessert...demolished:
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2051/2168634669_532d44be7b.jpg?v=0"" />
chris had an ""espresso pot de creme"" with little chocolate shortbread wafers on the side, cinnamon creme fraiche and chocolage kahlua.  that was completed with a marvelous muscat wine that brought out all the best qualities of the choco-spresso.  HEAVENLY.  mine was a ""pineapple spiced rum crepe suzette,"" langorously draped over a coconut macaroon and topped by a small scoop of cream cheese ice cream.  it was good, and very sweet, but i liked chris's dessert better.  </lj-cut>

it was expensive, and so really a ""special occasion"" venue, but TOTALLY worth it, and i can hardly wait to go again.  as we were leaving, we discovered that they have a basement bar/band area.  we also discovered that that was the place from where the sound of the jazz trio who'd been playing during our whole visit was emanating.  it's a warmly-painted, cozy room, and i look forward to revisiting it for a langorous evening of cocktails, small plates, and good music.  since 1924's so relatively close to my office, i'm going to have to check it out over lunchtime and get a better look around.  can't wait!  :D"

would anyone like to attend the <a href=""http://www.moyoga.com/workshops_davestringer.html"">dave stringer kirtan being hosted by kansas siddhi yoga studio</a> next friday?  it's $20, and it's bound to be a fantastic experience (i hear that his band is one of the best kirtan bands around)!

let me know as soon as you can -- we can buy our tickets online ahead of time, or at the door.  i hope somebody wants to go with me!!!  :)"

"event","i have a recipe for ""spicy crackers"" that it's become a tradition for me to make once a chill comes to the air.  unfortunately, i didn't remember the recipe from last year, and then i didn't read it properly once i got home.  so i made double the ""mix"" for half the number of crackers.  let's just say that they're very.....juicy.  good and spicy, but.....juicy.

hm.

methinks it's time for bed.  a nice, early bedtime.  oy."

"event","i am getting SO tired of people/organizations notifying me of/inviting me to events at the last minute.  it is INCREDIBLY rude in disrespectful of my life and schedule.  i mean, what makes all these people think that i have so little to do in my life that they don't need to invite me to things practically until the thing's begun??  especially in a world where everyone goes about complaining about how overly-busy their lives are, what makes people think that a (4.00 p.m.) wednesday invitation to a friday event -- one being held during normal working hours, which would require the average person to take time off from their work -- is even remotely acceptable, much less makes the recipient feel as though their time/schedule is respected?  

i've started getting really protective of my schedule.  if i don't have at least a couple weeks' notice for most things, i simply don't go.  i have very little ""spare time"" to toss about as it is, and no time at all to waste on people/organizations who don't value it.

yesterday after work, i had to wait in line for 45 minutes at the union station post office -- a line which wrapped around all the displays and out the door -- because they only had 2 post office employees working the 10 possible counters.  when i arrived and took my place at the end of the line, i muttered under my breath, ""you've got to be kidding me.""  the guy in front of me said, ""'fraid not.""  i said, ""what is this, christmas or something?!?""  he chuckled and said, ""i wish it was -- at least then there'd be something to look forward to!""  *ba dum chhhhhhhh*  i did have to laugh bitterly at the electronic sign on the other end of the long room, which had a message repeating and repeating on it about ""use the computerized ATM-type thingy or the usps website and you won't have to wait in line EVER!  it's SUPER!!!""  which wasn't an option for any of the people in line because we all needed personal service for our various boxes, shipments, purchases, etc.  *rolls eyes*

so i didn't get home from work last night until after 6.

this morning i was stuck in traffic for nearly half an hour, first waiting to get onto SW tfwy, then waiting to get up the w. plaza hill on said street because someone decided that morning rush hour would be the perfect time to drive their car into someone's HOUSE on said street, so all the traffic on what is usually a very-busy, 3-lane ""traffic sewer"" through midtown was cut down to one lane so all the cops, firemen, and EMTs could do their work.  the whole front end of the car, clear to the top of the windshield, was <i>obliterated</i>, thanks to the homeowners' quite-sturdy-looking concrete front porch being about 3 feet higher than the ground.  good grief.  

then, when i finally reached downtown, since the city still hasn't repaved 10th street between broadway and main (so that you're driving on the substrate and have to maneuver around manhole covers which stick up 3""-6"" above the ground, and bump up and down where the (paved) cross-streets meet 10th, and frankly i don't know how much more treatment of that sort my car's going to take before turning on me entirely), i've been looking for an alternative route to walnut.  so this morning i decided to take 14th street to main (nearly killing myself because i didn't realize that after wyandotte 14th street changes from a 1-way to a 2-way street, which i couldn't see because of the sun being in my eyes), go north to 12th street (because P&L district construction blocks 14th street past main st.), east to walnut, and north to my garage.  fairly easy process, no?  apparently not.  i made the right-hand turn onto 12th street to go the ONE BLOCK to walnut, and got stuck near the end of a block full of cars, all in the left lane because of street crews having the right-lane concrete torn up into piles.  after much horn-honking and frustrated flailing of arms, we discovered that a city bus had died <i>right at the corner of 12th/walnut</i>, blocking all the traffic in a single lane behind it.  so we had to wait until the street crews could move some of the piled-up pavement pieces out of the way so we could scootch past the bus and get on our way.  

so i was 45 minutes late to work today.  good times."

"event","while preparing to garden in my front yard the evening before last, i overheard my next door neighbor informing someone over the phone that she's got breast cancer and starts chemo next week.  i still haven't given any indication that i know, but i want to put together a care basket for her, filled with warm fuzzies that will help her through her treatment and recovery -- herbal remedies, teas, anything.  do any of my online friends know of anything i should include?  i'm rather clueless thus far.  

while her words were ringing through my brain as i was raking and hoeing the dead plants out of the front-side-yard, i managed to slam my hoe right into the entrance of a wasp next that was hidden underneath a patch of english ivy and whatnot.  one stung me, and about 903487203746 more came swarming out of the nest, all enraged.  needless to say, i fled into the house to nurse my wound.  and, despite all i've read since about wasps being very beneficial creatures to have around because of how well they keep the ""pest"" insect populations down, their nest is right where i want to build a gardenbed, and right <i>next</i> to where we're going to be pouring the patio.  so, although i'm very grateful for all the good work they've done in keeping *our* insect population in check, they're going to have to be raid-ed, i'm afraid.  *sigh*

one of my friends is about to burst, she's so ready to have a baby.  and i bet it's going to be the *cutest* little person evar.  

and one of my friends has to put her beloved cat to sleep today because he's finally succumbing to feline leukemia.  

the circle of life keeps on spinning and providing constant reminders of what the important things are in life, which need to be kept at the front of our minds at all times: loving, caring for, and sharing with our friends and neighbors, and respecting all life, even if its choice of homesite (read: ""nest"") means that it must die.  every moment is precious, every being has purpose, and the embrace of the Great Circle keeps us all."

"event","it is SO SO SO gorgeous this evening.  not a speck of humidity -- just the way summer ought to be.  i'm writing this while perched on my front stoop, enjoying the night music of cicadas and bats, the bedtime calls of the neighborhood birds, the soft evening breezes.  even the yapping of the new neighbors' dachshund is pleasant in this atmosphere.  *siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh*

i brought home lulu's for dinner tonight, and after a brief respite to soothe my suddenly-stuffed belly, went outside to do some gardening -- i got the remainder of the already-purchased-and-waiting plants in the ground in the front flowerbed.  even though they're small, you can see them from the street and the place is starting to look more civilized and less like a construction zone.  :)  there's nothing like ending a stressful day with a good round of gardening.  *strrrrrrrrrrretch*  i even carried a 90-lb bag of topsoil from one end of the yard to the other!  i nearly had a hernia doing it, but.....*flex*  

chris hoed up the part of the frontyard where the dumpsters and miscellaneous trucks left tracks and ruts, and then spread some sun'n'shade grass seed.  it's a lovely shade of seafoam green; goes charmingly with the pile of sand next to it.  haha

chris is sitting here trying to remove masses of silicone caulk from his hands -- it's quite stubborn and he's really having a time of it.  [edit: we googled it, and all it takes is rubbing the affected skin with a plastic bag.  it takes the stuff right off!  :)  ]

oh -- speaking of the neighbors' dachshund, we finally met them this evening while working in the yard.  they seemed very nice and not standoffish at all.  hrm.  ah well...bygones, i suppose.  i don't have the time or energy to hold grudges against people i've only just met.  x-P

welp, it's getting dark now.  guess i'll go hide inside for the night and leave the evening to the bugs.  thank the gods for ""off!""  :)"

"event","warp tour was awesome. im sure you've heard. i went to see larry the cable guy with *brad* his bro and michelle. i had a lot of fun. it made me realize that no matter how much i dont want a b/f ... i do like him. the whole day he would put his arm around me and stuff like that ... we ended the night with a good night kiss. that was nice. but i never know what hes thinking. i have a feeling he still likes natalie but he says he doesnt. and in a way i think she likes him. i talked to michelle, which is his bro's feiance', at the park, and she told me that he had mentioned that we seem to like each other at different times. well after that saturday it seemed we like each other. but idk. i guess not. but if we never like eachother at the right time ... then whats right so i know next time. anyways my family has been through kinda a lot lately. my dad is having surgery asap to have his gallbladder removed, my bro has a blood clot that could break free and kill him, my aunt is in the hospital once again, and on top of this there a hurricane. what luck huh?"

"event","""Jaded (These Years)""

There's a time and place, for everything.
There's a reason why, certain people meet.
There's a destination, for everyone.
What's the explanation, when we're done?

All the summer nights spent wondering;
So many questions asked, but no one's answering.
Would it be okay if I left today?
Took my chances on what you said was wrong?

I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless.
Not sorry, and I'll never regret.
These years spent, so faded and wreckless.
Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years.
I'll never regret these years.

Now here i sit, so far away.
Remembering all our memories.
Its times like these that I miss you most,
Remembering when we were so close.

I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless.
Not sorry, we'll never regret.
These years spent, so faded and wreckless.
Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years.

We'll never forget the places we've been, you and i.
Our lives are slipping away.
Don't want to let time pass us by, byyyyyyy...

I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless.
Not sorry, and I'll never regret. 
These years....
...spent, so faded and wreckless, 
Not sorry, and I'll never regret...
I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless.
Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years."

"event","<P>so its my senior summer and its awesome! im partying it up like i never thought i could. there is sooo much drama tho omg! its not even slightly funny! people are wanting to fight everyone else in the small little town. michelle and jessica, cory and jessica, me and kim are ready to jump this girl lyndsey ... and the list goes on. this bitch has been on my fucking nervous and has been the rudest person to me ever since me and ryan in october. now shes fucking with my friends and its pushed me over the edge. that whore bag better see us before we see her cuase she wont see us coming ... and it WILL come! </P>
<P>me, mandi, and jessica drove out to jax beach the other night for a lifeguard party... great times. mandi freakin almost wailed out on one of the lifeguards. he was being really rude and just a downright annoying drunk. and he pushed her too far and she hit him and spilled whatever was in his cup all over lizzy. of course she was pissed so we went back to lizzy's hotel and stayed for a little bit. then when we left we went to mickey d's and stole some food. lets just say theres no telling what you can do when you distract people. oh man, mandi and jess, WOW! lol .... hahahahahahahah. i dont think we got home till 5:30 or 6 in the morning... we were out stealing cones and signs all night ... just beware .. if you yard gets signed..you know who it was!lol! mwahahaha! </P>
<P>awwww .. sweet story .. i was working last night and this guy robert <REALLY middleburg to goes that guy sweet and cute>came into texas with kim and chris and walked me to my car when i got off work ... i sit down in side and he hands me this teddy bear right ... well thats not it. he was like look at the back of it ... my warp tour ticket was on the back. he had gone and bought me my warp tour ticket! what a doll! lol! </P>
<P>yeah so me and kyle are on talking terms again and so are me and brad! yah for me! although i may be gaining some friendships back i cant help to think some are slipping away and it hurts. kim and mandi are becoming pretty close and i cant help to think that im being pushed away. they get annoyed with me... or atleast thats what it seems when there both around me. i love them both .. theyre great but idk. i dont know how i would handle losing my best friend of 9 years. you know! im not sure what im suppose to do. i hope it all works out. but i got to go get ready for chucky cheese! lol! peace! </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>PS. &gt;&gt; I PASSED! I GOT MY REPORT CARD FINALLY AND I PASSED CHEMISTRY! WHAT NOW MRS. GEORGE! HAHAHA! IM A SENIOR! CLASS OF 05 ROCKS MY WORLD! WE WILL HAVE NO REGRETS GUYS. LIVE IT UP!</P>"

    PROM DAY!
  when i woke up on sat. i called kim and she came over so we could go get a few things done before prom. she talked me into that spray tan shit... DONT EVER TRY. it turned out orangy but i have to admit it didnt look that bad. it was only orange in certain lights. its faded alot but still there so its not as orange anymore. yahhhh. anyways i went to go get my hair done and it turned out REALLY good. i loved it. simple yet awesome. it wasnt curled but she had flipped and pinned my hair to where it looked like it was, then i had twirled hair around that. it was pretty or atleast i though so. lol. after i got that done i went over to kims to get ready we were ready soooo early ... or so we thought. when becca called i realized my toe nails and make up hadnt been touched yet. so we missed pictures. finally the boys showed up. they looked soooooooooo good. oh my word. we got to dinner and i had sooo much fun. i dont think ive laughed that hard in a while. anyways i had alot of fun at prom unfortunately. i mean its not exactly a bad thing but i was doing so well not having crushes. and it really dont help that ive already tried and things went really bad last time we tried dating. but theres something about that boy that just wont let me go. no matter how hard i try i end up kissin i him at the end of the night knowing it dont mean anything to him. or so i think. i know how he is tho and no matter how much i fall for him i know i cant have him .. not becuase he dont like me (even tho he dont) but becuase i dont want to start something if i know from the beginning it will end bad. you know. so to answer a bunch of yalls question do i like him ... my answer is ... no, yes, no, idk, I CANT! after prom we went to franks house to change then we to drews friends house for like 2 sec. and left becuase it was ssooooooooooooo gay. then we just went to kims house and slept. what a night. i just wished i partied more. haha. i wanted to get piss as drunk. i went home with only a buzz. i was pissed. but yah prom was really fun and i dont regret anything i just wished it meant something to him not just me. :("

I still had hope but i guess now it really is over between me and ryan! and i knew with the way he was acting it was going to be like this but its not suppose to hurt. it was always off and on. and for some reason, im really overwhelmed by it. maybe its because i wasnt just lied to about things, i was replaced. what the hell is wrong with me, i got replaced by a dyke! lol J/K i know yall think shes cool. i dont know her, soooo ....  thats just not right!&nbsp;i dunno why it hurts so bad. maybe cause i had so much hope? i dont know! but it does! all of the sudden everything is overwhelming me and i feel like ive been knocked down and i cant get back to my feet! like i have no one to help me up! i know i do! thats what kim is for and i know she is and always will be there for me but having some kinda of relationship with a guy ... even if its just friends is different from having a best girl. you know. i just want a guy that will be there when i need him to be and help me up when i have fallin. and i cant seems to find him anywhere right now! but im really not in the mood to be around people right now so im outie! peace out cou!</P>"

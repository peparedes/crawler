"event","The sun is warm, the sky is clear,

The waves are dancing fast and bright, 

Blue isles and snowy mountains wear

The purple noon's transparent might, 

The breath of the moist earth is light

Around its unexpanded buds;

Like many a voice of one delight

The winds, the birds, the Ocean-floods;

The City's voice itself is soft, like Solitude's.

 

I see the Deep's untrampled floor

With green and purple seaweeds strown, 

I see the waves upon the shore

Like light dissolved in star-showers, thrown;

I sit upon the sands alone;

The lightning of the noontide Ocean

Is flashing round me, and a tone

Arises from its measured motion,

How sweet! did any heart now share in my emotion.

Alas, I have nor hope nor health, 

Nor peace within nor calm around, 

Nor that content surpassing wealth

The sage in meditation found, 

And walked with inward glory crowned;

Nor fame nor power nor love nor leisure- 

Others I see whom these surround, 

Smiling they live and call life pleasure;

To me that cup has been dealt in another measure.

 

Yet now despair itself is mild,

Even as the winds and waters are;

I could lie down like a tired child

And weep away the life of care

Which I have borne and yet must bear,

Till Death like Sleep might steal on me,

And I might feel in the warm air

My cheek grow cold, and hear the Sea

Breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony.

 

Some might lament that I were cold, 

As I, when this sweet day is gone,

Which my lost heart, too soon grown old, 

Insults with this untimely moan-

They might lament,-for I am one

Whom men love not, and yet regret;

Unlike this day, which when the Sun

Shall on its stainless glory set.

Will linger, though enjoyed, like joy in memory yet."

I started talking to them and i was telling Dante how much i loved there music and how much it helps me out.  When i was tears were coming to my eyes and Dante started to cry.  He turned to the other members and was like thats the best feeling right there guys.  When you know your music actually touches someone.  I gave them all hugs and asked them to get back together for one more show.  Then i woke up!"

When i thought that there was nothing else more for me i get a phone call that cheers me up. It was you! This past month you we have become close again and i am so happy that we have. 

When i was feeling really down it effected my schooling and i failed a class. Now i am in a new class and it is really hard and i might fail this. If i do i am going to get kicked out of the school. = ( And that brings me too last night. We were texting back and forth and then you called me and i apoligize for not being sober. I love hearing your voice. I love making you happy. 

Well i went home and i fell alseep and i had a dream that you had moved to florida without telling me and i found you one day. But i was packing up and my parents had come down. I failed out of school and i was moving back to jersey. Well i just wanted to stay and be with you but my dad was being really pissy to me so i fought him and stayed with you. You were happy and i woke up crying. I miss you"

Just don't hold your breathe for anyone but yourself, because everyone else will fail you!  Past experiences only prove that everyone does this, so i really don't know if you can count on anyone.  I'm not saying I don't have friends, but i'm saying sometimes they fail.  I've failed too so don't think i am judging anyone, because i'm not.  I just think this week ate me up and spit me out.  I've come to the conclusion i miss alot of people i haven't thought about in a long time.  I've reconnected with them as well which is always a good thing but it probably wont last like usual.

"event","Well this weekend was a blast with some minor downsides.  

The Perks:  Friday     - Party at my place
                       - alot of pot and alcohol
                       - i saw sarah for the first time in awhile
            Saturday   - Band hung out with me (William's Eve)
                       - Band bought much more alcohol
                       - we smoked together
                       - i saw Kristin for the first time in like 2 months
                       - i went and saw the band play for free
                       - went back home and had another party
                       - damon was piss drunk and hooked up with justin
                       - dave, sarah, and kristin crashed at my pad
The Downsides:  Friday - got alittle too drunk to remember the entire night = / 
                       - i realized what i wanted = /
                       - i realized what i had, nothing


Well this weekend was fun, but i realized what i look for in a girl.  I don't know if i would consider myself real picky or what not, but yeah.  The band was amazing and they want to help support JETFOI.  Looks like Gabe, Don, Luke, and Shaun will have something too be happy about.  All i have to eat is fries, 5 Lbs. of FUCKIN FRIES!  

i'm done"

"event","I had a very nice conversation with a very good friend last nite.  How i miss shaun.  Talking to him made me look back on these past five years.  I think we both realized that we help each other out alot.  Just not with simple problems, but the problems of what we are too do with our lives.  Where we will be and what we want to be remembered for.  It seems everytime i talk to him he just pushes me right back to time travel.  I mean i have my own reasons for doing it, but i just cant stay motivated and he helps me to stay motivated.  We have come up with some good ideas over the time we have known each other.  What we have learned or at least what i have learned i have told to others and not knowing what it would do....it actually reached others in a way i never expected.  With knowning this it makes me work harder at what i love, it makes me want to spread more of my ideas, not with the intention of FORCING them on others but just to place them there for others to read.  If others like them and want to comment i apreciate that greatly.  If others want to ignore it i do not mind, because i am not expecting everyone to take it in.  

It is like i have these three great loves or passions in my life.  At the moment though, being in school and not having much time they all have to be put on hold.  Another problem that comes up is i do not have as much knowledge that i would like to have.  After finishing this school i would like to move onto another college and just study my other passions.  This is where money comes in, when you dont have much of it, it is hard to follow those dreams of yours.  While sitting here and writing this i am trying to realize that this is not right either.  Nothing should stand in the way of anyones dreams.  I seem to be repeating myself, to myself.  Sometimes i just find that this world can be so unfair.  

Now it brings me to another topic.  How people can be unfair in an unfair world.  Just in the past month i have found maybe three or more people to be unfair in there own beliefs.  How is it that you can say one thing now and then act totally different only days later?  I know none of them will ever read this but still it is just one of those damn questions.  You must not know the pain you inflict onto others when you do this.  If you are going to make a desicion that will effect more than yourself you must think long and hard about that desicion before you go through with it.  It only pushs those other people hopes up knowing your making them happy.  The fact that you are doing this in an unfair wold makes the world that much harder to deal with.  

Just think things through before you start them..."

   The time i have in florida is cherished, but with a sense of loss.  I'm losing out on so much, but what is there too do?  I mean isn't this a part of life?  I guess you could say i'm building stamina for the harder times.  Today was the last day i smoked.  I havent smoked ciggs for a couple of days now, lets hope it stays that way.  

Today while i was in class something kept making me think about new jersey.  I MISSED NEW JERSEY ALOT TODAY!!!  I MISSED SHAUN!  I MISSED THE ROADS, THE SKATING, EVERYTHING!  But even after this feeling i didn't really want to go back.  It was more of a 'i want people to make something with their lives' kind of a feeling.  I want my friends to be happy in their lives.  The few friends i do have i cherish and miss.  

  My Chemical Romance is a good band.  I don't remember who or how, but i started listening to them.  My Chemical Romance just has good beats and lyrics i like to sang along with will heading over to Damons.  What band do you rock out too?"

"event","Well besides being back in florida, idk what to do.  I have a will to just let everything go rite now.  If its truely mine it should find its way back, or at least its happened like that once before.  This is just the bigger test, because after this i'll be out there to venture freely.  I need to stop my bad habits but peer pressure and my environment doesnt allow for that.  I hate change too soo why would i change my environment and shit.  Eh!  I just want one thing rite now, but again i can wait till there is time.  When the time is right!  But knowing its there and its waiting and it could be mine makes me antsy.  What else....more people want time machines now a days.  Who wouldnt though with all the mistakes we make learning and teaching ourselves about this world.  It is only common for us to want to go back and correct those mistakes.  

I can look back rite now and with one subject i made a mistake or two.  Well that subject made its way back into my life with a big impact.  More than i had hoped for, but am willing too take.  I think what i am trying to say is maybe we dont need a time machine but just to come to terms with ourselves that we can fix things.  Everything and everyone just needs time to get on track, to find themselves.  The journey is well worth it.  

Another thing, don't let a movie or a song change your life.  I've had plenty of things influence me over the years, but now i realize that was all wrong.  You should just analyze everything, but don't take it all in, you don't get much from it except wanting what isn't for you!  

If anyone is bored and would like a good movie to watch then i totally think you should get American Beauty.  For some reason i've watched nothing but Kevin Spacely lately and he is a very good actor.  Its alot to take in but just pick at it and let me know what you think.  I really like knowing what others think.  Later"

"event","Well the past two weeks were amazing on so many levels.  Most of which cannot be discussed for too many reasons.  It started off amazing before i even left with a very long await conversation with an old friend.  That just syked me up for the trip and yea....thats off the record.  Then i went to my grandparents house and talked to my mom about life.  I ended up getting sick, like physically sick.  All in all though the coversation was needed and it was good.  Then i headed to New Jersey and i saw alot of people.  I saw Shaun, Jess, Tiffany, Don, Gabe, Kate, Ashley, T, and everyone at the shack.  I skated with Shaun and then i left my board in Jersey. = (!!  Then it was my birthday so i did that and got some nice things.  Next there was a party at the sub shack and i saw danny there and mark and Q - dog.  So much good alcohol, also i was hanging out with doug earlier that day and we got stoned.  So that was a good day!  Then the rest of the week i hung out with shaun and jess.  I also went and saw Spangalish, that was a good movie and a good nite.  When that week was over i headed back to Virginia to celebrate the New Year with my old friend.  I met there parents and they are just soo kicking.  The dad reminds me of myself quiet but tries to make discussion.  The mom was just outgoing and super nice.  She was on my team for beer pong.  It was a first time for both of us and we ended up winning three games and yea it started the nite off good.  Then we had dackeries?  i think thats what they are.  They were sluchies with vodka yea they were good.  Then the dad pulled out this vodka with flakes of real gold in it.  After that we played twister and something else but i cant remember.  Then the countdown started so everyone had champage.  Ew!  To end the nite at 3am we popped in Red Dragon.  The next night i went to my grandparents house to say hello goodbye.  My grandfather isnt feeling too well.  I love them both very much.  That was my break let me know how yours was.  Till next time."

Tom

I slept from 5am til 5pm today.  Talk about fucking lazy i had no class and i had no point to get up.  I woke up because Jess texted me.  After i got up i went and got the mail.  Nothing cool there, so i came back in and poured some milk and ate some cookies.  Then i called Jess and talked to her til i made a pizza.  I just finished it and ive been watching tv since.  Seinfeld and Simpsons and Everyone Loves Raymond.  Only two more days til i hit the long road and i just cant wait.  I shaved last nite so now i have no facial hair = (  O well.  My hair is getting long though.  Idk eh i cant wait til friday morning thats about it.  Waking up in a new place with an old friend in the same house.  That is good shit.  Music is everything.  Late"

  Lauging so hard your face hurts, falling in love, getting mail, the beach with friends or loved ones, laughing at your own laugh, just doing nothing with your closest friend, getting butterflies in your stomach everytime you see that special someone, watching the sunrise, sharing that moment with someone, watching a movie cuddled up on the couch with the one you love, waking up next to the one you love, just holding my loved ones hand.

You think the song ""Truckin'"" by the Grateful Dead should replace the national anthem.

Your music collection is worth more than your vehicle.

Your bong is taller than your dog.

It takes you more than 30 minutes to roll a joint.

You set your wedding date for 4/20.

You take off April 20th every year and treat it as a holiday.

You spent your last bit of money to score some herbs and don't have enough gas money to get home but you don't care.

You start every sentence with - uhhh!.

You intentionally roll seeds in your joints on independence day so you can hear the popping because you don't have money to buy fireworks.

You eat at Taco Bell more than 8 times a week.

You wear sunglasses at night, and see better.

You go to the corner store and the clerk automatically tosses a pack of rolling papers on the counter.

Your pot tray is fuller than your refrigerator.

Your bong gets washed more than your dishes.

You sell your car for gas money

You are the only tobacco smoker in the room and you look at the cigarette in the ashtray and ask, ""Is that my cigarette?"" 

You're eating something on your way home thinking about what you're gonna eat when you get home!

Every cylinderical object you see, turns into plans on a new smoking device....

Just to be religous, you observe 4:20 in every time zone.

Someone has ever come up to you on the street and said ""Hi"" and you said ""Yep.""

You thought the ebola virus was a type of weed.

You think being stoned to death would be a damn good way to go out.

You have ever smoked pot before 8 o'clock in the morning.

You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other pothead friends.

I was counting
The good things about this city
The only good thing is you are not here
When you're around it
Makes it hard to be what I need to be
I was trying to breathe
I was dying to breathe
I was hoping I'd never
Have to write this song again
The kind of song that makes
You want to hang
Your headached - head
And I was hoping
That I would never fall in love again
'Cause that would be the end
Of everything (you're everything)
My parents fell in love
And all I got was life
And all I ever wanted
Was to not be alone
I've been wearing this new outfit called
""Quit while you're ahead""
Your smiles are the end
Your eyes are the end
I was hoping I'd never
Have to write this song again
The kind of song that makes
You want to hang
Your headached - head
And I was hoping
That I would never fall in love again
'Cause that would be the end
Of everything (you're everything)
Just hang your head
Just close you eyes
Just hide your heart
Hide your heart
I believe that when I'm gone
My love will live in song
This is not where I wanted to be
I wanted to be
I believe that when I'm gone
My love will live in song
This is not where I wanted to live
I wanted to live"

"event","When i feel like crap it stays for days, or until the problem gets solved.  
I've been listening to nothing but leftover crack the past 2 days straight.
They are playing here on December 10th.
I hate when my heart and mind fight, its a battle with many casualties.
I really like my new l/j icon.
There use to be someone to always talk to, but noone is ever around anymore.
New S/N = KY Goddamn, talk to me sometimes, for i am lonely.

    There are so many parties but i lost interest.  I feel once again that drugs and alcohol are bad.
I don't sleep anymore, i stay up til 4 and sleep for 3 hours.
School is the only thing that keeps my mind occupied.

When i get home i only have the computer.

   Noone calls me.  Only shaun and ashlee text me.  Anyone else i always start the interaction.  It makes me feel like crap.
Music is all I have.

My bed is comfty but it feels like i am missing something, it is really big.

   I wish we were still in early 2003, when we would skate everyday and didn't worry about girls.  I had just gotten the car.  We use to drive around and find amazing new spots.  The car was amazing too, just to treat like shit.  

  I don't like where the road is leading me too.  Life gets so much worst.  Money, money, money; its all that it is about.  Well that and pain.  

  Unrequited love is the only love that you will ever find.  Even we you think your done looking, and your with that special someone.  They will shove it in your face.  You will do it to someone also.  So remember love is pain.  

  If i had my choice of dying, idk.  It is kind of funny and people would probably be like yea right you would never.  Honestly your probably right but still i want to become an Assassin for hire.  When i go i want to go by killing as many cops as  i can.  

  I'm not happy with me at most times.  The only thing that makes me like myself, lol, is my tattoos and when i have a gotee.  I actually started working out.  I use to have the nicest looking six pack and i want it back.  

   Only one person has been there for me since i was little.  They are still there for me at times.  One persons been there for five years now.  One has been there for four years now.  One has been there for me time and time again going on ten months.  One person more recently has been there since August.  These are the true friends to me.  

   Longest journal entry,  yes.  I keep a journal of my own.  Only one person besides me has ever read anything out of it.  That person means very much to me, but what if i lose them?  I feel i might and it hurts.  The journal i have is filled with many things, but mostly about my love life and my father.  One entry is all about my theories.  I started it a year ago in August.  

   I'm going to end on this.  I am fearing returning to New Jersey for several reasons.  I do not know what is going to happen.  I really would be better off not knowing, but idk.  Just let me see some fimilar faces and warm hearts."

You work so hard for something just to throw it away.  Was it worth it?  Like yea you know i can honestly say i've done it, but when it was done i realized it wasn't rite so i fixed it.  I dont know at this point, i want to go on that trip shaun.  Make the summer now!!  I can take up too 3 months off of school with it being excused but it has to be done at one time so yea, lets do it!!"

"event","What if the world was different?  Everyone takes everything for granted, but really its the small things you don't pay attention to that counts.  Like just laying with that special someone, even if they are alseep.  I would just treasure that moment forever, knowing they are at peace with me right there next to them.  How about going to the beach and watching the sun rise.  I mean that is what i live for those moments.  Just for laughs how about falling alseep with your friends and wake up with all three of you guys spooning.  (That is the funniest thing that ever happened at random!) 


    Maybe if we lived in a world like ""Equilibrium"" just for a month and then come out of it, everyone would see what they really miss in life.  Life is to short to waste."

"event","As we grow up we learn that the one person that wasn't supposed to ever let you down, probably will. You will have your heart broken, probably more than once and it's harder every time. You'll break hearts too, so remember how it felt when yours was broken. You'll fight with your best friend. You'll blame a new lover for things an old one did. You'll cry because time is passing so fast. You'll eventually lose someone you love. So take too many pictures, laugh too hard and love like you've never been hurt because every minute you spend mad or upset is a minute of happiness that you'll never get back."

The other nite jess told me how to make this thing that is useful, last nite i used it twice!  It was amazing.  So when i got home from school i passed out til nine at nite.  I stayed up talking to Ashlee til four in the morning on the computer bc there was nothing else to do.  Conan was on all nite though, that was amazing!!

"event","I wish I could say I am feeling better, but infact I am doing much worse.  I have a raging fever and am not only caughing up green and yellow phlem, but also some blood.  I think the blood is from my nose, which is rubbed raw from constant blowing (also green and yellow).  Last night April and I went out to get dinner and since there was no resturants around our hotel, we ventured into the alleys of Chinatown to buy from street venders.  It was delicous and April even found vegetarian food!  China town is jam packed with EVERYTHING.  Anything you could possibly imagine, and tons of stuff you can't even fathom cram the streets.  Since everything is grouped together, there is a lot of competition and therefore prices are really low.  So for example, we found the paper area with every kind of notebook and pen known to man, the shoe alley had shoes in every shape and size, from shoes for bound feet to shoes for the huge buddhas. After about two hours we got tired and headed back to the hotel where we crashed for the night (at like 6pm!).  This morning we got up around 7 and had a terrible breakfast at the hotel (complimentary breakfast at hotels is always a bad idea) and changed hotels to go to the Asha.  Asha was the guest house we stayed at when we first arrived in Bangkok last month.  Now that I've experienced several places around Thailand/Laos, I really appreciate the quality here.  The rooms are very simple and there is a shared bathroom, but it is clean and there is a nice common area with a pool.  Hot water and flushing toilets make it a good deal ($7/night for two people) and the really friendly front desk staff make it exceptional.  Do I sound like a tour book yet? I guess I've been reading too much of the Lonley Planet.  After checking in April and I set out to see the Wats (Buddhist temples).  I doesed up on cold meds every few hours to make it through our 10 hr excursion.  By the end though I was super sick.  I know, I pushed it too far, but we had to see the Wats.  The last wat we saw, we met a buddhist monk who wanted to practice english, so he gave us a private tour of the whole compound.  It was rated the best place to visit in the Lonley Planet (which also said it was the most overlooked by tourists - which is true since we so no tourists around).  It was really cool and he even showed us the famous university that is there for the monks (monks from around the world get sent to study at this university, its like the Harvard of Buddhism).  
Execpt for that monk (and a few other people, like the staff at Asha), The people in Thailand have been less than helpful.  They run up to us and tell us we are going to wrong way, to point us in the wrong direction, just to get us lost.  Everytime (EVERYTIME) we ask for directions, they point us in the wrong direction and we end up walking several blocks out of our way before finding ourselves on the map and reorienting ourselves.  It has gotten so bad, that April and I refuse to listen to any Tai person who is giving directions.  On top of it, they tend to tell us wrong things (like that a certain place is closed, when really its open, or that this place isn't what we're looking for, when it is).  At first we thought it was a language barrier, or that we were stumbling into the wrong kind of people, but it has happened so often that April and I now think it must be a national sport to point foreingers in the wrong direction.  It is frustrating, annoying and maddening. 
April ate durian for the first time today (and wasn't impressed) and we tried several other weird looking things, none of which were very good."

"event","April and I went out last night.  we started with dinner and a footmessage/pedicure then found a couple of clubs.  I am stll very sick, but made an effort because April really wanted to go out.  The first club, a futuristic, all white, alien looking place with tons of beds to sit on, was pretty much empty.  The second club, called Q, was packed.  The crowed was interesting since April and I made up 2 of the 4 non-Tai girls in the club and the 4 male bartenders were the only thai guys inthe club.  There is something called Tai-fever, where older well off white guys date and marry young Thai women.  We've seen this all over (picture nasty old white guy with gorgeous young Thai girl), but it was esspecially true at the club last night.  We has been asking ourselves, how these guys met the girls, and now we know...  Club Q.  anyways April ended up hitting it off with at Thai girl who's cousing owns a resturant in Greenville, NC right accross from April's school (small world). She was with two 30-something Turkish guys.  Surprisingly, the club closed at 1am! and the thai girl invited us to continue partying at another club about 15 min away.  I was tired and sick so I opted to go home (my big mistake) and left April with the Thai girl, two Turkish guys and two very nice french guys I had been talking to.  April made it home all right (I was worried) but when I asked her how it went, she replied that ""that is a part of bangkok I never want to think or talk about again"".  She hasn't said much since.  She woke up this morning at 10:30 (actually, I woke her up because we were checking out of our hotel) with a terrible hangover and has been barly functioning all day.  She also managed to loose three of my travelers checks in the process (not intentionally of course, I jsut have to call and cancle them).  
So April had really wanted to change hotels every day to see what different places looked like.  This is not my idea of fun, so we compromised by changing every other day, therefore staying in 3 different places.  We had picked out two guest houses from the Lonley planet that were close together (so if one was full, we could try the other) in Chinatown area, but not too close to the center (where there is tons of traffic and more crime).  We got a taxi to take us to the hotel - or so we thought.  He charged us 4 dollars and dropped us off, telling us the hotels were just down the street.  We had shown him on the map 4 times where we wanted to go.  Unfortunatly, he apparently didn't know how to get there, and in typical Thai fashion, would tell us that, so he just droped us off somewhere in China town.  Knowing nothing about Chinatown, we didn't know any better and got out and paid him before looking at the map and figureing out we were on the exact opposit side of chinatown!   So we hired another cab (a tuk tuk) who spoke some english.  He insisted on taking us to a TAT station (usually a communications center, but in this case it turned out to be a travel agent). He wouldn't take us where we wanted to go until we taked to the travel agent (telling us we needed to call the hotels first).  I sent April in to the place while I waited with the bags and tried to convince the guy we didn't need reservations.  He kept insisnting I go into the building and he would wait with the stuff (I realized that this was an extreemly bad idea since he would jsut take off with our stuff).  Since I wouldn't leave, he started to try to talk me into going shopping with him (there is a well known scam here where a taxi driver talks tourists into going shopping at a place he knows well and has good barggens.  The place sells shitty made stuff and the taxi driver gets a commisson off whatever the tourists buy.  there is apparently high pressure to buy the stuff and even threats of not getting your things in the taxi back unless you buy something).  So I kept telling him we did not want to go shopping, that we had no money and that we had already done all the shopping we wanted (all of which is true).  He was very pushy but I was insistant.  April didn't fair so well. She ended up getting convinced to book us a room in a hotel in the center of Chinatown.  Its a bit expensive, very loud, but luckily is in the Lonley planet as an ok choice in the area.  She only booked one night and when she told me, she said ""we'll just cancle when we get there"" but I showed here the not so fine print of a 60% canclation fee.  Poor thing was so hung over and tired that all she wanted to do was find a bed, so that's what she did.  She is now sleeping the day away as I tour Chinatown.
So Chinatown is a really really really bussy place where there are no street lights but everyone moves at 10 miles an hour because the traffic is so heavy.  I thought bangkok was pretty much jsut concreat (like NY), but this place is even more so.  Small streets are cramed with everything possible.  It is segregated into sections accourding to proffession: Machine parts, Jewlery, food....
We happen to be near the Jewlery section and not anywhere near food :(
Money:  On a side note, there is a $1 fee for every travelers check cashed into Bhat.  I was stupid and got a ton of $20 checks and only 2 $100 checks so I loose $1 on every check.  Live and learn I suppose.  Wachovia has decided my card must be solen, since I used it in Bangkok when we first arrived last month.  Unfortunatly, I can't call them since they only have a 1800 number and I've been everwhere and everywhere tells me you can't call a 1800 number from Thailand (so I've writen my parents to try to work it out).  THis means I have almost no money or any access to money since my card is salled and my travelers checks lost or already used.  I guess its time to come home, eh?
We leave on Friday, Aug 19th a 1:20 am flight from bangkok to Soeul (arriving 8:40am).  We leave Soeul at 11am and arrive in NY on Friday Aug 19th at 11:40 am.  April then flys to NC and I head to Carina and Vladamir's place.
On top of everything, I am still sick and getting sicker."

"event","Well,April seems to have evaded the cold, but its got ahold of me pretty well.  We had thought to go out last night dancing but found the price of enterence was about $15 on the weekends and only $5 on the weekdays.  We've also been told that more people go out on the weedays then weekends here because weekends are typically reserved for family. SO instead we went to this little Italian resturant, found a good massage parlour and got a $5, 1 hr Tai massage.  That made me feel better.  Then we headed to the very ritzy Emporium shopping mall where there is an english language movie theater and saw a new Tai movie (with english subtitles) called Tom-yum-goon.  It used every karate film cliche in the book and was so over the top it wasn't even funny anymore.  The most interesting part was before the film started when they played the national anthem to picutres of the king on the screen and everyone in the theater stood up."

"event","So we survived Laos!  Actually April and I had a great time (despite Faith) and really liked the laid back atmosphere of the country.  We adapted pretty well (we think) to life there and even enjoyed the sketchy toilets with no running water.
Yesturday was our last day, which was pretty hecktic since we had to buy all the souvenires we wanted and almost missed our ride out of town.  Our tickets said the van would pick us up at the hotel at 5:30, but it came at 4:30.  I was just about to get on the internet to write everyone, when April comes running from the Hotel to tell me they already left and would be back to pick us up in five min.
The boarder crossing was no problem and the second class sleeper car in the overnight express train to Bangkok actually left on time (amazing!).  We all remarked about the change of attitued and pace life as soon as we got over the boarder.  Thailand is definatly more bussling than Laos.
We got into Bangkok this morning and found a hotel.  We then hit the weekend market (which is HUGE), where April bought herself a new wardrobe ;-)   We ditched Faith as soon as we got to Bangkok (after our big fight last week she decided to head down to the islands as soon as possible.  This suites both April and I as we were getting really annoyed with her ranting)
We are both comming down with a cold (and high on cold meds) so we are going to take it easy for a few days to try to recover.
I thought I had a roomate set up in NY for when I get back, but it turns out there was a miscommunication and she is moving to Brooklyn not the Bronx.  So I will again have to apartment hunt as soon as I get in."

"event","Yesterday after I wrote you April and I got invited to sit in on a english class taught by Bianca, one of the australian girls who works in  Nam Tha.  It was very interesting.  There were six Lao students, one girl, five guys, all from different ethnic groups.  They were very interested to learn about american culture and very interested to discuss Lao culture.  We talked for a while about weddings and since I was the 'married' american, I told them about typical american weddings. They were very interested and kept asking a lot of questions.  Then we went to dinner with Bianca and her friend Euginie, who was in town visiting from Australia.  Euginie flew out to Vientiane with us today.
Today we got up and wnet to the airport and after we checked in, went back to the boat landing for breakfast.  They have the best fruit pancakes in the whole world so I was happy to have them one more time.  I was kind of nervous taking Lao air becaue it has a bad track record (actually it doesn't release information on safty, but it is well known that if it is foggy or cloudy, they can't land since they have no navigation system apart from the piolet's eyes.)  The flight went well though (on a very small and loud airplane) and was one of the smoothest rides I've had here in Laos (where everything is  bumpy).   When we got to Vientiane, we went to the imigration office to get our visa's extended, and they have to keep our passports overnight.  So then we went to a couple of guest houses, until finding a room for $12/night for flushing toilet, tv with satilite, hot water, and aircon.!!  Ah, the life of luxury.  It is much much hotter here then in Nam THa, so aircon is apreciated. Faith felt this was too expensive and too cushy, so she got a shitty little place down the street,which she now regrets because her room is invaded with ants.
We went to lunch at this vegetairin resturant where our food all came out half an hour apart and even though I was the first there, I was the last to get served and hour and half after I ordered food.  I was sooooo hungry
We wondered around for a while and found the bookstore with the Lao Plants Name book for $20 and got that.  Its really a disertation, but its totally worth the money.  
We also went to visit some Wat (buddhist temples) which are beautiful if very gaudy with all the gold and shinny metalic decorations.  We sat in on a buddhist ceremony at one wat and talked to a young monk, who was hitting on april, at another wat.  I,  unfortunatly, didn't catch on to the fact that she was also hitting on him and started asking him a lot of questions about the wat and Laos.  April was quite annoyed with me, for good reason.  Oops!  I get very carried away with my questions sometimes and monopolize the conversation.
THen we ate dinner down by the mekong, which is covered with little outdoor BBQ resturants.
Anyways that was my day.  I miss you so much and also can't wait until I can talk to you and see you, even if its only on Isight.  I think that will make this all a lot easier.  I think about you all the time and wonder what you would thing of this or that and wish I could share it with you.  Only 9 more days until I come back to the states.
Aug 11: Roomates and Government
I dont' know how this NY roomate thing will work out since I just got an email from Heather saying she was looking for something in Brookly (I quickly wrote her back saying that I wanted to be in the Bronx).  We'll see what happens.
Today we started out trying to find the Traditonal Medicine Research Institute (TMRI) which we thought was at the Ministry of Health.  Turns out its not.  We ended up calling the director (who I've been in contact with several times and was introduced too over email by Dr. Soejarto from UIC).  The director informs us that we have to have special permission from the Cabinet minister for the ministry of Health in order to just visit the TMRI.  So we set up an apointment for this afternoon.  The minister however, decided to go home early and so we will try to meet with him tomorrow.  I can't belive we have to get the minister's permission to visit the center or that I can just walk into his office and set up an appointment!
We also had lunch with Renee from WCN who we had met in Nam Tha and she sent us off to the University with two of her collegues.  They introduced us to the only Botanist at the university who toured us around the new Herbarium (the first one in Laos!).  Faith and I are going back tomorrow at 1pm to have him look at our plant specimines.  We also need to use his dryer since it is impossible to dry specimens since it is so humid here. 
We spent the rest of the afternoon going through pictures of plants and trying to lable them."

"event","Aug 6 : Trecking
The trek was interesting - except for faith.  It was two days in a two person river kayak.  You remember how I said I couldn't stear, well I got put with April, who really can't stear so I was in the back.  It took me about two hours and three dives into the river to figure it out.  Just when I got it, Faith decided I looked like I was having (in her words) 'too much fun' so she complained to the guide that she wanted to be in the back of the boat.  So he switched me to the front of our boat, faith in the back and April to the front of his boat (she was pretty tired and had just gotten over being sick, so it was a good change for her, which is why I didn't put up too much of a fuss).  Faith managed to tip us over 4 times in 3 hrs, smashed my thumb nail so that it is purple and bleeding (it will probably fall off) and yell at me the whole time.  To the point where the guide came up (keep in mind that I'm in the front, and faith is in the back yelling at me to paddle harder, which I have now been paddling my heart out for a few hours and can hardly move the paddle let alone 'paddle harder').  The guide said to Faith ""it would go much easier if you paddled and did some work once in a while'.  I hadn't realized that all she had been doing was sitting in the back yelling at me to paddle harder, without doing anything but occasionally dipping her paddle in the water to stear us - usually in the wrong direction so that we got stuck or had to duck under a tree and get scratched up or tip the kayak over. She started to complain that she couldn't paddle because she was too tired, so I offered to switch so that I would be in the back, but she said she didn't trust me not to tip us over (at which point I pointed out that I had not tipped april out at all, even if I had tipped myself out a few times).  The next day I was in the back (I won RockPaperSisscors) and steared the whole time flawlessly, with her sitting in the front bairly paddling, but it was sooooo much better than being tipped into the water the whole time.
The village we stayed at was very interesting. T hey were Lanten ehtnic group.  We stayed in a small bamboo hut and slept on a raised bamboo table.  THey cooked us local food over the fire (we saw the duck, saw the duck killed, defeathered, and cooked).  In the morning I helped Pawn (the owner of the boat landing and trek tour agency) with a meeting with the villagers where I also got to ask them questions about the forest and products they used.  I will tell you more about it when I get back.
At the end of the kayaking, we ended in another Lanten village where there was a boy who had cut his finger.  I looked him over, but he needed stitches, so we took him to the hospital (2 hrs away).  After seeing the hospital, I will never again send anyone there.  I would have done a better job myself."

"event","I'm sick.  What else is new.  I have Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever - or at least we think I do.  Aparently to test for RMSF it takes two week in which time, if your not already being treated with antibiotics, you will be dead or close to it.  So they went ahead and started treating me.  Its not like normal sick, there is no nasal drainage or coughing.  I'm just ALWAYS exhausted and my muscles feel like they weigh a hundred pounds and my head hurts really bad.  Every joint and muscle in my body hurts and I'm sure when I'm done with this entry I will be so tired I will go back to sleep.  I'm supposed to see the doctor every day for the next week so she can keep track of me (this was better then the option of being stuck in the hospital for observation, although everyone is on standby).  Adrian had RMSF last summer and he said it took him a week to recover and it kicked his ass.  He normally doesn't get sick, so I don't even want to think of what it might do to me.  
On the other side of things, my Laos trip is comming together.  I'm starting to  make a pile of stuff I need to bring, and I got some grant money and have applied for more grant money.  My sister is comming into town today so we can plan some more this weekend."

"event","Friday was my thesis defense.  At first the computer didn't work so we had to run around to try to find a computer that did work.  FInaly it worked and I started my one hour seminar.  I looked out at the audience and there were my parents and Ryan, Alex and Faith and many of my graudate friends.  There were also the DGS and the head of the department and many other molecular people who are critical of ethnobotany.  I was so nervous I thought I would be sick.  At one point I thought I would faint, but I worked through it and kept going.  I don't even remember what I said, and there were tons of questions afterwards, but I did it.  The oral exam part was easy, since the committee felt I had already answered their questions.  Therefore I PASSED!! I now have a Master of Science.  I then got really drunk at my party which was a lot of fun (Thanks to everyone who came)
Then, to top it all off, today I open the mail box to find out I've been accepted to CUNY's Biology PhD program!!! I'm so excited I can't sit still.  It looks like I'm moving to NY folks!"

She is very nice, though she tries to stay out of the way too much.  Yesturday Sammi and I went to the movies and in the evening Ryan and Sammi and I tried to go bowling, but it took 1.5 hrs to find a bowling ally and then it was all full, so we came home and played board games instead.  Today we went to the mall and she stayed at the mall while Ryan watched football and I went to dance class.  Unfortunatly I didn't get as much work done as I wanted too since I didn't want Sammi to be too board (I think she was anyways)."

I am taking Statistics for Biosci (very usless for my research, but required by the department), Buddhism (really hot teacher, but all undergrads so it goes slow), and I am teaching just one class and doing all the prep for 33 sections.  luckily I have help on the prep."

"event","I have now lived in wisconsin for over 3 weeks.  The first two and a half weeks, the weather was atrocious.  Within a week we had frost (yes, at the end of June, we had frost), a tornado (the first to hit madision in over 10 years), and an earthquake (1.6).  It was so cold that I had to buy a winter hat and scarf.  I was wearing long sleeve shirts and sweaters with a jacket and jeans in the middle of June.  The past few days however have been nice, in the 80s, though it has rained quite a bit.
The Madision campus is pretty, and is located on a large lake, lake mendota.  The campus departments and specialties remind me of NCSU since it has Ag, Engineering and all that jazz.  But it seems to have a stronger humanitites department.  and less brick of course.  
The house where I am living has seen better days.  It is drab and a bit run down but the people are nice.  there are 17 people living in the house and everyone seems to get along.  I have been hanging out with a group of girls from the house who are very nice.  The house is about a mile from class located on the top of a large hill which I get to hike up every day after school.  It is good exercise for me.  Speaking of which, I am on the Lao-Philipino vollyball team and we won our first game last week.  We play wed and fridays and have practices whenever we get a chance.  I have also signed up to start a Palaties class with one of my roomates.  I am looking forward to that.  
Lao is going slowly. I wish I was progressing faster, but the teachers seem to be satisfied with our progression. I am in the first year class with two other girls.  They are Hmong and are already exposed alot to Lao so they catch on quickly.  I am always trying to keep up.  I missed class on Friday because I was quite ill, but am feeling a little better today.  My fever is gone and my nose is running clear and not green.  Last weekend we went to a Lao buddhist temple in Rockford Ill.  It was very interesting.  I was appauled that nobody washed their hands before handing food to the monks, but other than that it was a great time.  There was some very tasty food and I really like rice with coconut milk.
I miss Ryan alot and we talk every day on the phone.  He is comming to visit June 15-20th and I am counting down the days.  Well that is life here."

This time, I am ending up in the same places (except Barcelona next week) but loved paris and hated amsterdam.  See, I dont like the touristy stuff in Paris, but this time, I let Ryan go off on his own to see the Eiffle tower and the like, and I went to the Natural History Museum to the Herbarium (the oldest and one of the bigest in the wolrd) to do research.  I could have spent a year there, but I only had one day.  I got a lot of good information however, and am going to apply for grants to come over and get more good information. Also that night we saw a cabaree show at the Crazy Horse which was very good (and very expensive). Amsterdam, I realized, is exactly the same thing I saw the last 5 times I was there.  I got to see Astrid in Cologne however, which was very cool.  I think Ryan is having fun and he is doing very well learning french.  He even learned to count in German!"

"event","My research has been going well and badly.  The bad part is that the head of the graduate students for the department had not realized until recently that my research did not consist of field work or lab work.  Instead I read through old manuscirpts writen by european explorers about Laos.  I pick out any mention of plant use and record it.  If the plant is identfied by the writer, it gets recorded on a master list of plants used historicaly in Laos.  Many times the plant is identified with the local name, which means I get to hunt and hunt and use linguistics and taxonomy to try and identify which plant was mentioned.  This is usualy quite difficult.  But to the department head, this isn't enough.  So now I am franticly trying to apply for grants so I can travel over to Laos in December and collect plant samples...."

"event","We are having terrible problems with our Apartment complex.  It started a few months after we moved in last summer.  We get these letters from the management company on our door (they distribute them to everyone).  The first one we got was more or less benign, but it had atrocious grammatical and spelling errors (it had to have been bad for me to catch it!!).  So bad that I felt the need to take out a red pen, correct it and turn it back into the management company.   It must have worked because the grammar has gotten much better.  but since then they have sent out letters saying things like, if you see your neighbors dog pee on the grass, you should follow them back to their apartment to get their apartment number and turn them in. (Dogs are supposed to pee in the forest outside the apartment complex).  Also things like if you see your neighbor put the trash outside their door, you should turn them in so the complex can fine them $25.  In these letters, most of the wording IS IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE ALWAYS YELLING.  Sometimes it is even bolded.  We have tried to tell them about this but they say they do it for emphasis and that nobody but us thinks of it as yelling.  Well the worst came when they put out a series of memos all stapled together and buried in the middle somewhere was a new rule that if you didn't put your apartment number on all of your checks, they would consider the check invalid and your rent would be late.  Later in the memo pack they remind us that if our rent is late they will charge us a $50 late fee and revoke all concessions for the remainder of our lease (which could amount to hundreds of dollars).  The next day they put out a memo saying that if our rent was late they would make sure it went on our credit report and we would never ever be able to buy a house or rent anywhere else again.  Do these sound like threats? because they did to us, especially when they are in all caps.  So we complained and complained but it all fell on deaf ears.  So finally we decided to put out our own memo to all the neighbors telling them that if they are as fed up with this as we are to tell the management company to change it.  Apparently there were tons of calls into the company (Told to us by a fed up employee who was tired of taking the calls).  The company avoided taking the blame by telling people we were just upset because we had violated the rules (though we haven't violated ANY of the rules and said so in the memo).  In any case we have a meeting with the head of the management company this week.  Funny though, we had lots of people tell us they were not going to renew their lease and a few days after our memeo came out, another memo was sent out by management saying that if anyone was thinking of not renewing to come talk to them so they could work out a deal to get people to stay.  Little do they realize that the deal would be respect, which they don't seem to understand.  Even the guy in the office Carina talked to compared the residents as children who needed to be spanked and that is why all these memos come out."

I really need the vacation and spend most of the time relxing near the pool or on the beach and sipping pina coladas (they were sooo good).   One day we rented a car and went to visit some Mayan ruines.  That was very interesting, especialy since I could eaves drop on about 3 different language groups touring around so I would pop in then translate to Ryan and his parents.  On the way back we took the sceenic rout and got to see all the small Yucatan villages.  I was very interested to observe what was growing in their gardens.  Ryan and I also went to a couple of clubs.  This one was like a mix between circle de soeile and a techno club. It was amazing!"

"event","Get this! I got my oil changed a couple of weeks ago at Jiffy Lube.  I'm always really good about getting my oil changed every 3,000-5,000 miles.  In fact, I once went 6,000 miles, but was too busy for an oil change, and got so worried that every time I drove, I drove with the radio off so I could listen if anything was even sorta going wrong.  I know, I'm obsessive about some things.  So last saturday, while driving around, I noticed my oil light blink on and off when I braked really hard, but it only did it once.  I thought this was very strange since I wasn't due for another oil change for over a 1,000 miles.  But, my car had been acting funny and had been noisier than usual and I had even called saturn to make an appointment to bring my car in for a check-up.    The next day (sunday) the oil light would come on every time I braked hard, but not when I came to a soft stop or while I was driving.  I started to worry and wonder what was wrong.  It couldn't be the oil because I just got it changed two weeks prior.  that monday the oil light came on more frequently and by tuesday I was really worried.  Wednesday I didn't drive it at all and thrusday morning I got up extra early to take it down to the gas station. I checked the oil stick at this point and saw there was NO OIL on the oil stick!  The guys at the gas station helped me put three quarts of oil in the engine (its a 4 qu. engine).  They asked if I had seen oil under my car, but I hadn't (and I had even looked).  They thought that jiffy lube had probably quickly drained the oil but in doing it quickly left a quart or two in the engine and forgot to fill it up so it ran for a while fine, then the oil light came on.  I was pissed.  I could have really messed up my engine.  So Friday it snowed and when I drove the car around saturday it drove much nicer and quieter.  Sunday, however, my car started to overheat half a mile from my apartment!  My dad came up with some coolant fluid and when he opened the coolant tank, he found it was full of oil!  He ruled out blown head gasket because there was no coolant in the oil tank.  He figures jiffy Lube, in their great intelligence, put the oil in the coolant tank instead of the engine.  My car is now at Jiffy Lube while they try to fix the problem.  What idiots!"

I knew Ryan was really down because he had been organising, for months, to have all his collage friends to come into town (its a tradition) and go to my parent's beach house for the week, but at last minuite (just before christmas) they all backed out.  So to try to make the best of the sucky situation, I made some baked bre, poured us some drinks and set up the cribbage set.  Come to find out (after playing cards for 2 hrs) that all Ryan really had wanted to do was play his video game and be away from me.  He was just playing cards to make me happy and I was just playing to make him happy.  so then we kinda got mad and I went to bed. Overall, New Year's sucked."

Everything that could go wrong on the way  up did, including getting lost, breaking down, and getting stuck in traffic for 3 hrs because 3 semi-trucks jacknifed and they had to cut a guy out and hilicopter him out.  Once we got there, the stress stated.  My grandmother was stressed because she was throughing christmas for about 40 people.  so instead of getting some research done, I ran around helping cook, clean and prepair for christmas.  we were up everyday at 8 and not in bed before 2.  All this stress lead me to get a cold (which I still have) and become throughouly exhausted.  Christmas was fine, Ryan played santa and really enjoyed giving the gifts out to the kids.  My little cousin said ""that's not the real santa"" when Ryan walked in with full santa gear, but after my cousin sat on his lap and Ryan said ""hey Grant, did you enjoy that magic 8 ball I gave you this morning?"", Grant came running to me saying ""he knew who I was and what he gave me!! He's gotta be the one!""  It was all very cute.  We spent one day taking Ryan around downtown Chicago including lunch at the 95th in the john hanckok, the art museum, navy peir, and a show of the joffrey nutcraker (one of my cousins is a ballarina in the show).  It was a beautiful show and when we left the show about 4pm, it started to snow.  Sunday night we went swing dancing so I could break in my new shoes.  There was this really great big brass band and it was so much fun.  In any case, I'm really happy to be home.  I think Ryan and I will probably stay in for New years and just relax."

One of my costudents from Botany, Faith, came over to my parents house yesturday evening with Ryan and I to put together a costume.  I ended up recycling my French maid constume but Ryan and Faith got really creative with their constumes.  Ryan went as, what we can best describe as a Vages Porn Producer.  He has this kinda sleezy looking short sleve button down shirt that he wears open over a white wife-beater and jeans.  He barrowed one of my dad's belts with a huge shiny silver belt buckle, my dad's cowboy hat with feathers around it and these huge silver sunglasses.  My mom equiped him with several fake gold chains in various lenths with different large gaudy pendents on them.  He looked ridicuouls and realy awsome.  Faith put together a jester's outfit with the top to my midevil prom dress and two pairs of tights and a jester's hat.  She got voted in the top five best costumes of the night. Ryan felt that I was the hotest costume there but that's because he made me put on a push-up bra that made me look like a hooker, which sorta went along with the costume theme so it worked.  He was impressed and I had fun, and I guess that's what counts.  Many of the botany grads were at the club and we danced and had a lot of fun.  I'm looking forward to more parties this weekend."

"event","I am obsessed with design shows.  I don't have TLC or the Discovery Channel, because I don't have cable, but my parents do and I what it every time I'm there. They make do-it-yourself projects look easy.  In two days they can convert a drab, boring bedroom into an exotic wonderland.   So refinishing 4 kitchen chairs should be easy, right?  That was my theory.  Ryan and I had inherited my parents' old kitchen table and chairs, which were my grandmother's old kitchen and chairs.  The little sticker under the table says they were made in Nov. 1954.  after 50 yrs of wear and tear the stain on the chair arms, back and seat had worn thin.  actual the stain was no longer existant.  This should have made the project even easier, less stain to remove.  It did not.  I transported, with some difficulty, all four chairs down to my parents where there is on hand expertiese and space both for striping and staining.  Stripping the stain off the chairs required gooping this orange smelling toxic gel onto the chairs, leaving it for thirty minutes(no more, no less) and scraping it off.  Easy? no.  The goo got everywhere, my hair, my arms, the floor, everywhere except the chairs.  Once I got the goo on, I stressed about letting the goo dry (the back of the bottle has a warning that the gel should not dry on the chairs).  The problem was that I was working with too many chairs at a time.  By the time I got the goo on the fourth chair, the first chair had dried.  So I set aside one of the chairs and just worked with three.  It took about 12 hrs of scraping, scrubbing and gooping with steal wool, and plastic scrapers.  12 hrs of steel slivers, trying to get the stain out of the little cracks in the little spindals.  12 hrs of back breaking, itchy work. by the end of day 1 my fingers were bloody and bent in a semi-perment curl.   Striping the stain took another 3 days.  Finally I was on to the sanding stage.  The electric sander felt really nice vibrating against my abused hands.  Unfortunatly, the electric sander could only take me so far.  See, the chairs have these very intriciet carved spindals and each one has a million little crevices to get into.  Sanding took 5 days.  Ah, Staining.  this was easy at least.  Just splash some stain on the chairs (a little on the floor and a lot all over my mom, Ryan and I) and let it sit.  only, we forgot an very important step in staining:  Wipe the stain off after 15 min.  oops.  so the stain was uneven and look like parts of the chair had water stains on it.  We went through several suggestions on how to fix the chairs.  I wiped them down with Mineral spirits, more stripper, even tried sanding them again.  But nothing helped.  The other problem was that the color of the chairs was nothing like the color of the table.  The chairs were brown, the table is Cherry (I wish I had known that to begin with).  finally after another 4 days of working with the chairs I decided to apply another coat of stain, but of a red, cherry color.  I did that this evening and they came out wonderful! (I even remembered to wipe the stain off)  Now I just need two coats of varnish and 48 hrs of good drying time and the chairs will be as good as new.  So my 2 day project turned into a 4 week project.  I just hope it's all worth it in the end."

"event","so I went to the neurologist today. he was nice but didn't have any good things to say.  In fact, almost everything he said made me depressed.  He told me that I'm not allowed to drive for six months.  I don't think he is going to tell the DMV about my siezures though, but by law I'm not allowed to drive for six months after i've had a siezure.  well, Until I hear from the DMV that he has informed them of my condition, I'm assuming I'll be ok if I drive to the corner store and back.  
He also finaly told me of some of the side effects of the Dilantin that I""m taking.  Apparently not only will in help prevent siezures (which could restrict oxygen to my brain and cause brain damage) but it will also make my hair grow in darker (on my head, my arms and my face), make my cognitive thinking and resoning skills start to diminish (i.e. I won't be able to reason out problems, learn new concepts, or react as quickly or easily as before), and to top things off, it will start to darken and distort my facial features (i.e my nose will start to spread out, my cheek bones will become sunken, my eyes will become sunken and squinty, and my lips will start to look pailer and sunken).  So I get to become dumb, ugly and loose my independence!  The alternatives?  There is a drug that will also prevent siezures, but costs $700/month and isn't covered by insurence. or as the dr said ""well, if we find out you have a brain tumor we can take you off the drug and you can start driving again"".  So did you want good news?  sorry, maybe next time."

So I went to the doctor yesturday to get my MRI results of my spine and because I've been haveing a few more problems I needed to discuss with the dr. (like headachs, nosebleeds, aparent siezure...) the good news is I don't have to have surgury on my spine but I have to live with a 'petrusion of the T3/T4 vertebra"".  This may be causing some of my pain and can only be helped with medication.  After talking with the Dr about my other symptoms he decided to be on the safe side that I should have a few blood tests done and an MRI of my brain.  He says he's sure its probably nothing but they want to rule out a few things (such as calcium defficiency, low electrolite count...brain tumor...).  So even though I'm sure its nothing, I'm starting to freak myself out.  I need to just stop thinking about it and actualy belive that its nothing. But instead I'm being a total hypocondriac, every little ache and pain in my body is being over analyzed by my now very worried brain.  maybe I'm just going crazy?"

Mostly I would have just complained about not finding a job over and over and over again. so here goes my rant about jobs.  I had this interview with Cato research the begining of January. They called me back for a second interview (good sign)at the end of January.  They keep emailing me letting me know that they are still interested (good sign) but nothing seems to be comming of it.  I can't sit around forever waiting for them.  So I didn't stop searching for new jobs.  I finaly got two interviews over at Duke (after sending out a million and a half resumes- to the point that I was cut off from sending any for a month).  Today I had an interview with a Dr in the Liver Center.  They are researching treatments/cures for liver fibrosis.  I thought the interview was not going too well. He seemed to be asking me a lot about what I wantt o d when I go back to school (he said he wouldn't hire anyone not interested in continuing their education and asked if I had thought about going back to school- so of course I said yes and even explained that Duke had just rejected me for Grad school last week).  He also asked a lot of where I had interviewed and gave me a few suggestions of where to go to look for a job (at this point I figured, that's it. I blew it).  Then he said that he thought Iwas perfect for the possition and he would like to start my paperwork tomarrow!!!  he asked if I had anyother interviews schedualed and I said 'yes, next week over at the Human Genetics Center'  and he said ""well, lets see if we can snatch you up before they do"".  So I have a job! hopefuly I'll have more then one offer, but I'm not getting my hopes up. I'm just happy with one offer."

The internet, food, transportation.... and if its not fast enough (or even if it is) there is always someone trying to make it go faster.  there are two things going on in my life right now that are causing me stress due to anticipation.  One is school.  I ended up applying to four grad schools: UNC, Duke, Harvard, and Hawaii.  Duke was a last minute choice (I just applied this week).  But I won't know anything from any of the school until at least late January.  The suspense is killing me.  I try not to think about it but I""m constantly checking my mail box and email for some sort of indication on how my application is doing.  Knowing full well that they won't even LOOK at the applications until the Dec 31st due date.
The other think is a job.  I've applied to several jobs that I am getting my hopes up for when I know I shouldn't.  One is at NCCU (central) and two are at Duke.  They would be sooo cool, but of course they stop taking application in a week and it will be at least another week before they start calling for interviews so why do I keep picking up the phone to see if there are any messages from them?  this just proves that patience is not my strong point."

After about 15 min. one of the manageres called me over and told me I had to take it off. I asked her who was going to inform all of the families who had lost someone in the attacks on 9-11 why I was not being respectful to their pain.  (I realize this was a bit overdramatic, but it was a pin for crying out loud!).  She told me that all she would have to tell them is that it was unproffessional. I told her it was unpatriotic. so she sent me home.
[I'm thinking of giving my two week notice in tomorrow.  I don't need this job. I have another one that starts on Sep 28.  This was just a job for ""in the mean time"".]
So when I got home Ryan asked why I was home and I explained what happened and he was like ""why didn't you just take the pin off"". He said they had every right not just to send me home but to fire me because I was ""out of uniform"" (IT WAS A PIN).  Then he asked why I instigated such a thing by wearing the pin in the first place. I told him that I was just trying to show respect for what happened a year ago.  He said that all this is bull  and that we should all just forget about it and move on (not in quite those words).  I was shocked.  So now I'm mad at him, mad at work and just all around feeling like everything I was trying to do today to be sympathetic and respectful was in vain and stupid."

He said to come back to the house as I was driving back, something fell off the bottom of my car.  come to find out it was a bolt -- the bolt that holds my brakes in place.  so I came back to the house and my dad checked it out and said they hadn't put one of the bolts on and the other one had fallen out. well we went to the Merchant place today and they guy tried to play it down ""oh, it wouldn't have been a problem.  You have three other breaks..."" My dad threw a fit when he heard that because he siad it was really serious and I could have been killed
because the breaks could have come off and torn the fluid with it and then I would have never been able to stop. so the guys replaced everything and checked everything

On Thursday I had my wisdom teeth pulled.  It was not fun. Luckily I only have the top two and those are supposed to be the easiest to come out.  I fainted three times though.  Once after getting the shots of novicane, and after each tooth was pulled.  The Dr got really mad at me for fainting.  He started yelling at me and pulled the laughing gas mask off saying that if I didn't stop it he would kick me out and stuff like that.  Like I had any control over fainting. In fact, I really hate fainting. I have these really weird dreams for the 20 seconds I'm out then for another 30-40 seconds I can't figure out where I am or what I'm doing.  When I faint right in a row again its even more confusing.  I really don't like it, but I have no control over it.  My body feels pain, I faint. Its a physical reaction.  Normaly the dr.s are required to call you afterwards to see how things are going, but he hasn't.  I think he was really upset with me.  Anyways I'm doing fine. not totaly eating solid foods yet, but I can swallow small bites of food, and lots of ice cream.

"event","I did it!!  I did my thesis defense.
Criticisms:  I reversed the Publisher/City in my footnotes.  one of my dates for when a physician lived was wrong (but even that they said was very trivial since it doesn't effect my research and was just an aside)
Praises: They said it is the best work they have seen done in 10 yrs.  That its even better then some of the dissertations they have to read and if they could give me a PhD instead of a BS they would because its just that good.  They loved the way I pulled together the biochemistry, botany and history.
Problems: Its too controversial and too long for publication (according to them).  They would submit it to an award but the Botany dept doesn't have any for this type of paper.  They really 'regret' that they can't do more to help me get my knowledge out to the public, even though they think it would be of great use to the world.
My thoughts: I think they just don't want to put their name to something so controversial for risk of their already developed reputation.  I, on the other hand, have no reputation and it can only to up from here (even if someone proves my theories wrong, it will still be looked at as a good undergraduate research paper).  So I'm going to try submitting it myself."

This is the field of study I have curtailed my classes to as a Botany major, and includes History, Anthropology, Sociology, Archeology, Geography, Botany and Biology (and a bunch more).  The best school I found is in Hawaii.  The whole point of me looking for Grad schools was so that I could stay near Ryan (instead of going to Peace Corps first).  I always planned on going to Graduate School and Peace Corps, the order that I do them doesn't really matter.  Now that I have found Ryan, I don't want to loose him yet, and so I decided to put Grad school first so that I could stay near him while he finishes his PhD (which will take 3 yrs).  The problem? there aren't any good schools in NC for Ethnobotany.   The closest thing I can do is stay here at state and get a dual degree in Anthropology and Botany (which would be possible but not exactly something I want to do).  U of Hawaii actually has an Ethnology degree, and looking at the list of courses makes me drool.  They sound soooo interesting.  [more later]"

We arrived earlier then expected at the airport and caught the train down to Namur.  It was April's first time on a train and she was excited.  Nothing interesting happened, it just took an hour to get down there and I was already tired from the trip over so I wasn't in the best of moods.  Maman and Aaron (their exchange student from Raleigh that I placed into their house) came to pick us up at the train station.  The weather was beautiful (for Belgium - cold with bleu skies).  After eating and showering, April and I walked around Namur and did some cloths shopping.  The style is plaza pants now (go figure, America goes tight on pants and Europe goes big).  That night Catherine came down with her boyfriend Matt and we all ate Raclette and then Papa, Cath, Matt, Aaron and Julia (maman and papa's other exchange student who is 15 and from Canada) all went to Boulivard du Rum to have a huge cocktail (It's called a Picine and is big enough for 5 people to drink out of.  Papa is now smoking, Aaron influenced him into it, and it's obnoxious."

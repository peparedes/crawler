It is still a little strange living in someone else's some in another country, attending a foreign university, and eating different food. I have already suffered Montezuma's revenge but am recovering. 

I think after I am 100% again it will be time to take the weekends to explore the area. I have already made a list of things I want to see while I'm here. 

Anywho...just wanted to check in.

Monon Bell is this weekend and I feel weird not going but I'll be there in spirit I suppose: Wabash Always Fights! I guess its weird because I don't know if I'm still friends with those guys or how it all worked out. 

Purdue's last home game is tomorrow and I'm pretty excited. Hopefully we'll win and eventually play in a decent bowl game. *crosses fingers*

Well, Happy Friday everyone and here's to a relaxing weekend!"

I'm so proud of him and I'm excited to see what it'll be like. Then Wednesday through Sunday is HOBY!!!!!!!!!!! I am so incredibly pumped. I FINALLY get to be a counselor and I am beyond excited.

I had dinner with Ahson's family and it was lovely. My dad, aunt, and uncle came to his graduation and everything went very well :)

The one thing about graduation is that I learned this year that those who say they will keep in touch not always do. I lost touch with people I thought I would always be able to talk to and be good friends for a while after they graduated. I hope to keep in contact with those who graduated this year because they have played a very large role in my college life and I would be sad to lose that all of a sudden.

Its summer. Now what? haha It feels so strange not having a set schedule yet. Soon I'll be working but right now, I'm basking in the relaxation.

"event","This always happens at the end of the semester but it has never hit me so hard. Many of my good friends in Tomahawk are graduating. Granted, a few of them will not be far away but there are a couple who will be states away in less than a month. This makes me sad. Sad that they won't be around and doing stuff in Tomahawk and sad that I didn't spend more time with them while they were here. Ahson is also graduating and going on to medical school. Hopefully, he won't be too far away but there will be some adjusting. Some of Ahson's brothers who are friends are graduating as well. Things are changing drastically for me and I'm trying to get prepared. 

At the end of the year or the semester, I think everyone goes through the ""if"" deck saying what they could've done academically: ""Oh, I should've studied more or been more organized."" ""I should've tried harder in general."" Or socially: ""I should've spent more time with (----) while they were here."" These statements can drive a person mad. Yesterday, I realized that the semester is almost over. All I have left is 1 paper and 2 finals and the semester will be over. Yes, I have tried this semester but my classes have been super challenging, I've had an incredibly busy semester, and have tried to spend as much time with Ahson and my friends as possible. I've come to the conclusion that my classes were difficult, my time was spread thin, and I did my best to find a balance in regard to all activities. 

I understand that people graduate and move on but I have never had so many people so close to me graduate at the same time. And its even crazier to think that I will technically be a Senior next year! Yes, I still have 2 years left but how strange is that? We are all growing up so fast and I don't want things to get so busy that I can't even see my friends anymore. I plan on savoring the time my friends before they move on and that Ahson and I can spend lots of quality time this summer. 

I wish all the gradates best of luck in the future and I hope life turns out the way you want it to be. I hope we keep in touch and that life allows us to talk every once in a while. Ahson, I know you'll excel in medical school and I'll be right here all the way :) 

The world is changing. My world is changing right in front of my eyes and I am trying desperately to keep up."

And most of all, make everyone feel good about themselves. Schools tends to get to people, including myself, and take away confidence and replace it with frustration and sadness or anger. I know school is supposed to be challenging and somewhat difficult but when did it become so emotionally taxing? And why is this necessary? 


Hang in there everyone. We're almost done. Remember to breathe. Keep your chin up. And just take one thing at a time. 

Everything will work out and be okay.

I just saw a report that said suicide is the second leading cause of death in college students with roughly 1100 each year. I don't want my friends to become part of this statistic.

For a mediocre grade that doesn't properly represent my ethics as a student or my passion for what I am studying? Why must students wade through the shit of professors' problems and ego-trips? Why must we all suffer from those awful professors that make us think twice about our majors? This sucks. I feel so incredibly frustrated and I am trying...I really am. But the more professors beat me down with undeserved grades, the more I am inclined to say ""fuck it"" and move on. What is happening? I used to be able to get good grades and now I feel like I am slipping. I feel like I owe it to so many people so do well, including myself. I just try to keep telling myself that employers won't look too closely at my GPA but my 2 degrees instead. This only covers up my frustration and anger with myself and professors. Maybe I am losing my intelligence....maybe this is the wrong path for me. *screams* I really just need someone to tell me its going to be okay and not expect perfection when I can't even get average these days. I guess no one can help me since I can't even help myself. </div><br /><br /><br />*sniffle*"

"event","I don't mind where you come from
As long as you come to me
I don't like illusions I can't see
Them clearly

I don't care no I wouldn't dare
To fix the twist in you
You've shown me eventually
What you'll do

I don't mind...
I don't care...
As long are you're here

Go ahead tell me you'll leave again
You'll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand
It's all the same
And I'll take you for who you are
If you take me for everything
Do it all over again
It's all the same

Hours slide and days go by
Till you decide to come
And in between it always seems too long
All of a sudden

And I have the skill, yeah I have the will
To breathe you in while I can
However long you stay
Is all that I am

I don't mind...
I don't care...
As long are you're here

Go ahead tell me you'll leave again
You'll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand
It's all the same
And I'll take you for who you are
If you take me for everything
Do it all over again
It's always the same

Wrong or right
Black or white
If I close my eyes
I's all the same

In my life
The compromise
I close my eyes
It's all the same

Go ahead say it you're leaving
You'll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand
It's all the same
And I'll take you for who you are
If you take me for everything
Do it all over again
It's all the same

"event","BEFORE:
I was asking myself many questions. Why did I become so cynical? How did I get here? I used to never let anything bother me. I would let little things slide. I would not let my day be ruined by an off-the-wall comment or someone else in a bad mood. It was so frustrating and I felt like I was in a rut. A rut with school, with friends and a little with family. What could I do? What is wrong? Who has made me feel so bad? Why have I done this to myself?

AFTER:
Today was a wonderful day. I woke up ready for the day to begin. Yes, school is a bit frustrating but I need to face it head-on. Friends are fantastic. Family is always family and I am so grateful to have my dad. Ahson is more than amazing. I just need to boost my self-confidence and be the Karla I know I can be! Yes, I was in a rut but I am shaping up and getting back in the swing of things. 


Thank you to everyone who has been so wonderful. Ahson, you put the biggest smile on my face :) Thanks for all your support xoxoxoxo

My life is amazing! How could I forget???? *giggle*"

"event","Question everything. Everyone. Every situation. At any particular moment, something could change your life forever. Circumstances, fate, destiny-whatever you want to call it can play a part in day of your life. Any person you meet could be a good friend, a significant other or someone who will impact your life without knowing it. Do you pay attention to those around you? Have you thanked those who have made a difference in your life? Are you lucky to have amazing friends? How did you become friends? Was it through school? Other friends you aren't even friends with anymore or just pure coincidence? It is strange the way we pave our way through life without ever noticing how we get where we do. Do you believe it is fate? Do you believe you have gotten there on your own with no help from any other outside sources? 

I suppose I am trying to say that I believe there have been some amazing influences and a bit of destiny has played a major part in my life. Without some past events, friends or school functions I would not be so lucky. However, I am and I thank my stars every night for my wonderful life :)

The simple things in life count...those little things that happen daily that go unnoticed until they are no longer there. Appreciate them now, while you have a chance. 



I am the luckiest."

Friday was fantastic! I got to hang out with Seth and we saw Flyboys. Then I went to a pub and got to see Joel and  Topher. I got to see 3 of my favorite people in the same night! I got to talk to Bitsy not too long ago and hopefully will get to see her this week some time, along with Seth and Topher and some more of my favorites! :)

Yesterday was so fun. Walk for Diabetes was in the morning, 6 a.m. to noon so I was up at 4:45 a.m. roughly. After the Walk, went to Wabash. Courtney Jean came up and Amy was here too. We all went to the football game and had dinner. We girls went to watch the Homecoming Concert with Glee Club and other groups. After that was the Hootie and the Blowfish concert! It was pretty great...it was a great night. Then the rest of the night was just mingling and talking with people. I got to catch up with a few and it was wonderful, let me tell you. I miss some of my friends. I miss talking to them on a regular basis and knowing how they are doing and what's going on in their lives. I just don't want to lose them...


Today was just chillin with Ahson at Wabash. I am staying here tonight and then going home tomorrow for the day. Then back up to Lafayette to do lots of work :)

Hope those on Fall Break enjoy it and to those who are not yet, have fun when you get there! :)"

I had a lovely chat with a very good friend this weekend. That friend of mine is one that I have not had the pleasure of having many conversations with lately. Truly wonderful. He reminded me that there are friends you will find and hold on to who will be there through anything and everything. I have noticed some friends falling off to the wayside but I could have a really good conversation with him even though I've only been able to say hi a few times in the past month or so. It is one of the best feelings to be able to open up and talk about anything and have the conversation lead to some life lesson neither of us ever thought of before. After I think about where I was a year ago, I am amazed. I have changed and I am in love and life is so wonderful. Crazy the way life takes certain turns along the way but still everyone ends up where they should. 

It was a very reflective and memorable weekend. *hugs* Thanks to all who made that possible. 


Busy, busy week ahead of me but Monday has been excellent so far."

I had to see World Trade Center for one of my classes and I still can't get over the visual of people jumping out of the building or the faces of the relatives. I can't shake how I felt when my dad was activated and I didn't really see him the next 6 months or the mornings he was shipped out. I can't. And I hate that I had to see it and be reminded of how horrible it was. I hate that those people made the movie and if you can't remember September 11...where were you?

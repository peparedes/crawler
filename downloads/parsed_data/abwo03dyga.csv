"event","I feel sick from all this name calling between Nyla and I's groups, I think we all should just drop the subject and enjoy our summer. But not everyone will since there are currently 20 some comments to what Nyla's mother wrote, both bashing me and her. It's just so over done, and no I am not just saying that it's just that I am sick of receiving e-mails about this, it's time to move on ya'll. what's said is said and what's done is done. I personally don't need all the comments to me. Thank you. 

I am seriously concidering getting a new screen name or just not posting, so you all won't have to worry what bitchy, unpolite, rude abby will say anymore."

"event","I hate when people eat loud food in quiet places.  For example, I'm in the computer lab right now and someone decided that they wanted to eat an apple.  Don't people know that when you're in a quiet place where other people could need quiet concentration, that is not the best time to whip out loud food (or any food for that matter) and eat it.  These are times when people suck.

That's all.
Time for choir. 
Long day.

"event","So I am procrastinating.  It's about 2:30 on a Tuesday afternoon, and I do not want to start my homework.  I know that I should.  I know that I need to.  But I am doing everything I can to not start.  For example, on television right now is a special on HBO about talanted young musicians from around the country.  Right now, I'm listening to a 7 year old boy play the accordian play amazingly.  Also, I watched these different girls who play guitar/made bands (ages 9-13).  I thought it would be exciting as a future music teacher working with these kids (possibly), but all it does is make me depressed that I am not this talanted.  Damnit, I wish I was this good when I was 10.  Sometimes I wish my parents pushed me a little harder when I was playing piano and horn.  I'm sure I could've been so much better.  

Yeah, and now there's a 10 year old boy named Tyler, who is not only one of the best trumpet players I've ever seen, but his jazz improvisation skills are fricken amazing.  Best kid I've seen so far.

Anyway, I suck at violin.  I usually pick up instruments pretty quickly, but my gracefulness is not there.  And I am not good.  

I audition for Grant Park on February 16th.  The audition piece is Kyrie from Mozart's requiem, which is amazing with all the parts, but not amazing on one part alone.  In fact, it's pretty damn hard to sing alone.  I'm actually practicing a lot more than I thought I would, so at least I'll feel prepared.  If I don't make this choir...well...I will be sad.  I wanna sing Mozart's requiem.

I'm writing a piece for piano right now.  It's pretty.  I need to buy/borrow a score program so I can write it down.  They cost around 800 bucks, so if I can find it cheaper or free anywhere else, that would be amazing.  I hope this isn't a failure like everything else I've tried to write.

THE BEARS ARE GOING TO THE SUPERBOWL!!!!  So are most of the people I am usually with when watching the games.  Who's going to be in Chicago during the Superbowl?  Who wants to watch it with me?  Anyone?

Ok, I can't procrastinate anymore.  It's time to start work.  Eww.

Laterz Gaterz."

"event","There is a new MTV reality show entitled ""Exposed"".  It is where a person goes on a date with two people while that person's best friend is watching the date and putting everything the dates say through lie detection software.  It's amazing how MTV can find the most beautifully HORRIBLE actors to play these people.  It makes me smile...and wonder if I was actually on a reality show, if I would follow the script.  Probably not.

Well, I went to Vegas over the break.  I came back 50 bucks ahead, which I found to be huge since everyone else in my family lost money.  My cousin, Brittney, and her boyfriend, Dave, met up with us for that week.  I didn't realize how awesome they are.  They're coming to Chicago this summer, and hopefully I will be joining them in New York.  

Christ has a new place.  It's awesome.  She lives across the street from Lutheran General hospital, which means if anyone comes down with alcohol poisoning, it's not a far trip to get help.

I'm most likely dropping my philosophy class because I already have to take another philosophy class for my education degree.  It'll be nice to be one class down...a little less stress...better work for my other classes.

I'm starting to teach a 3rd grade class once a week.  They are the cutest kids, and so talanted when it comes to clapping syncopated rhythms.  I think I may have a future ""rainman"" in my class.  Long story.

I should start homework.

"event","I'm bored again.  I'm watching season 8 of Friends that Scott let me borrow (is it sad that I'm excited about my boyfriend having all 10 seasons of Friends?).  I've seen this whole season, but I still watch it.  Maybe to catch something that I missed that was funny.  

ISU was a lot of fun.  Laura is always a pleasure to see, and I met one of Scott's home friends who I fell in love with.  And her name is Katie, which makes her cooler.  I also got a free June shirt, which normally I wouldn't admit, but it's american apparell with a cute penguin on it.  I also got to see Mike Lach, which is always fun because he's the coolest.  I got drunk.  The bears won (with no help by Grossman) and I slept on the car ride home while the boys discussed sports.

I went to a Elementary/Middle school band and choir concert.  It was one of Scott's friends who's the music teacher there.  It's in bumblefuck, but I loved it.  All the kids were super cute, and they played Hot Cross Buns.  

I've been having these weird dreams about my friends.  I need to stop having them, because I've been waking up reacting to these dreams.  Then I have to remember that they are just dreams and that they don't mean anything.  

Christina's livejournal makes me smile.  She said I was rightious.  I think I am.

Laura had a Christmas list on her livejournal.  I have one too.  People should get started on this:
1) A triceratops
2) A flying horse carriage (the kind that are used by the Beaubatons Academy in Harry Potter)
3) A pensieve (the kind that Dumbledore has)
4) I want to be in an episode of Entourage

...yeah, it might be a little difficult, but it's doable.  

I think I should stop.  Good night everyone!

Jim Gaffigan is in it.  That was a long sentence.  School is over, and I got my grades.  5 A's and 4 B's.  I'm actually not as happy as I should be about it.  Is that sad?  Probably.

I've been practicing a lot of guitar this week.  I've been doing a lot of scales and exercises from my guitar book.  My finger picking is getting pretty good, if I do say so myself.

Tomorrow is the Ola benefit show at ISU.  I always love going back there.  I'm excited to see Laura, as well as others.  Apparently there's a party at Mike Lach's place, and I haven't seen him in ages, so that's exciting.

I miss Europe.  I want to go back.  I want to live there.

I'm super excited for the 5th Harry Potter movie and the 7th book.  Since they're trying to stretch the HP franchise for as long as they possibly can, I won't expect these two for a while.  Even if they're promising the spring of '07...I don't buy it.

This Christmas (or Dec. 21-26), I will be in Las Vegas with my family.  We can't get over quality time with each other...and alcohol...and gambling.  I'm so excited, but if I hear ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas."" one more time, I will punch someone.

Reality is catching up to me quicker than I thought.  I'm nervous for the future, and the future will be here in less than a year.

"event","So, I finally have some time to update people on my life.  Even though most of you know what's going on, I like to write it down to look at it later and feel good that I took the time to tell the world (or a few friends).

1) Europe: The most amazing time of my life.  As you all know, I went with my sister to London, Paris, Interlaken (in Switzerland), Rome, Venice, Salzburg, Munich and Amsterdam.  All in 16 days.  
  1) London: We stayed at the Globetrotter Hostel.  It was nice, with clean rooms and a bar that stayed open as long as people were still drinking.  We saw all the sites, made sure to check out the city with the London Eye (the biggest ferris wheel in the world), and it was our first experience with European beer.  Bars close at 11pm on weekdays, so we ended up at the hostel bar (which will be a trend throughout the trip).  Best people met: Mario/friends from Austria who I taught some American slang such as ""fan-fucking-tastic"" and ""dipshit"".  They began teaching me why Europeans hate Americans.  
  2) Paris: Although it's true that the french hate Americans, we didn't get fucked with that much.  Except for the woman who tried to make us pay 10 euro for a bottle of water...bitch.  We stayed at the Peace and Love hostel a little north of the city.  It was run down, and the reception desk was the bar.  We saw all the good stuff, including the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Notre Dame, etc.  The people we met were amazing.  There was Hayden and Shane from New Zealand (""Kiwi's) who were the funniest people I ever met in my life.  There was Finn and Liam from Philly, Nikki from England, Dave from Canada, and Andrew from Australia (""Aussies).  We drank at the bar, then went to another bar in the city where a French guy told someone that I was a slut and he was going to sleep with me.  I ""accidently"" spilled beer on his tacky white jeans.  Oops!
  3) Interlaken: I'm going to live there one day.  Placed in between 2 huge lakes, then surrounded by the Swiss Alps, it is the most gorgeous place I've ever seen.  Everything looked like it could be on a postcard.  I went canyoning.  My sister went skydiving (the only place you can skydive out of a helicopter).  We went paragliding.  Canyoning was the coolest thing I think I will ever do.  Freezing water, huge jumps, hiking, swimming, AWESOME.  Oh, and we went hiking (in the rain) with a personal trainer from Seattle and I proved to be out of shape.  I'm over it.  Coolest people: Jaffer from Seattle, Jason, Lance and Mike from New York, Jim from Australiam and my canyoning guides, Luke and Mark (hotttt!).  Oh, and there was another guide who I fell in love with, but I never talked to him.  First time I remember being shy.
  4) Roma: Dirtiest place I've ever seen.  But, still filled with history and cool architecture.  It's just hard to enjoy the colosseum when there's small graffiti on the walls.  The Vatican=huge, but cool.  The Sistine Chapel was slightly disappointing because we couldn't talk, take pics or videos, or really even breath.  St. Peters is the greatest place I've ever seen. We didn't meet anyone in the hostel, but we did on the English speaking bar crawl.  Alex and Jimbo from Britain, Conner and friends from Ireland (who couldn't be more cliche) and some dumbass New Yorkers who sang the National Anthem on a crowded bus.  They got booed.  Shocking.  We got so drunk, that at the 3rd bar, we didn't even go in.  The guy above the bar didn't appreciate us outside his window, so he threw a bucket of water on us.  The food=amazing.  Oh, and my sister and I were grunted at by local pervs.
  5) Venice: Not all it's cracked up to be.  The first 3 hours we were there (6-9am), it was great.   No one was around, so we could enjoy the beauty.  But then the tourists showed up.  Everywhere.  It was like cattle trying to get through the streets.  My sister and I met J.C., who after a while, got on our nerves.  He was a wigger from Atlanta who spent the last 3 years in Japan.  We all bought awesome masks.  I went to the Vivaldi museum and saw his violin and harpsichord.
  6) Salzburg: Known and very proud for being a) the city where the Sound of Music takes place and b) Mozart's birthplace.  Unfortunately, it was raining the whole day.  We still managed to get some stuff in.  Went to the house where Mozart spend his teenage/20's in.  Got an awesome shirt that has a button that plays the C Major Symphony.  We also saw a castle, where we got sausages.  GREAT!  We drank at the hostel again (not much of a party town) where we learned about the pranks Aussies play on Americans.  If they ever talk about ""hoop snakes"" or ""jump bears"", they're fucking with you.
  7) Munich: Another place I'd love to live, it's a good time.  Went on a tour, saw the glockenspiel with the dancing puppets, and saw some breweries.  Megan and I stayed at the HofBrauHaus, ate some sausages and had a liter(stein) of beer...at noon.  The HBH goes through 10,000 liters of beer A DAY.  Yes, the Germans love to drink.  Later, we went on a bar crawl and met more awesome people.  The ""Beatles"" which consisted of 4 british guys, decked out in colorful, frilly tux shirts that are in a band, Holly, the Kiwi, Isiah (our tour guide), a white, jewish guy originally from Compton, Nick (the dbag) from Australia.  After getting drunk, we went back to the hostel to drink more.  There was the bartender, Kano, from Australia, and THE NAZIS!!!  Real life Nazis.  Nothing's scarier than knowing your being pursued by Hitler lovers, especially when they start yelling every 5 fricken minutes.  After 5 am, not wanting to go to sleep, we went to another bar that stays open until midday.  Drank more.
  8) Amsterdam: Heineken museum.  1pm.  Drunk. Met some Americans. 3pm. Stoned and drunk.  Walked around.  Watched ducks/swans.  Nightime.  Red Light district.  Saw a lot of hookers.  They stand in small rooms in front of doors and lure men.  Some are ugly and slouch and smoke.  Others were pretty and pushed their boobs in unsuspecting faces.    Lots of men selling x and coke.  They whisper it in your ear and then vanish.  Passed out at 1.

That was my trip in a nutshell.  If you want any details about anything, let me know.  I am willing to share.  And yes, I intend on moving to Europe someday.  I'm dead serious.

As for school that has started, my life is over.  I am taking 10 classes equaling 22 credit hours.  I am at school everyday for 3-12 hours (friday is 3 hours, my easy day).  I'm going to start quasi-student teaching at an elementary school once a week for an hour and a half.  That will be fun.  I have a lot of crap to do, so most likely, you won't be seeing me.  I will be done by Thanksgiving.

As for the title, Minnie Driver is rumored to be dating the love of my life, Criss Angel.  He doesn't really love her, and he will come find me when he realizes I'm his one and only.

Ok, sorry so long, but get over it."

"event","Hey, not too much to report (since most of you know what I'm doing with my life anyway).  Summer's been pretty slow since I don't have a job or school.  But not for long.  Next week, I finally start the Grant Park Chorus.  I'm nervous as hell because I'm working with one of the best conductors in the world.  Even though he's little and cute and from Scotland, apparently, he's one scary man.  But we're singing Carmina Burina as our first piece, so that's exciting (aka, it's fricken awesome to sing).

The other day, I went to Great America.  I haven't been there since high school and it was a blast (until I got nausia and skipped half the rides).  It was cool though.  I got to play mom.  I held everyone's stuff and watched them go on the ride.  Then I set up all the sandals on the ground for easy access to get them on.  I know, I'm kinda lame.  But nonetheless, it was fun.  The three couples probably made some people who were there want to commit suicide.  You know how it is when you see a bunch of couples together waiting in line.  You kind of want to punch them in the face.  Yeah, that was us.  Ah well.

As I've said 369,847,000 times, I'M GOING TO EUROPE!!!!  My sister and I go at the end of August for two weeks.  We're going to...
1) London
2) Paris
3) Aix-En-Provence
4) Interlaken (skydiving in the swiss alps)
5) Venice
6) Rome
7) Salzburg
8) Munich
9) Amsterdam

We're living out of backpacks, hostels, and the train.  
Yeah, I'm fricken excited.

Christina is at the doctor right now.  She's sicky sick.  I was supposed to go with her, but she didn't wake me up.  I hope she's not dying.

""Scottie doesn't know"" spends a lot of money to come see me (gas is a biatch).  I feel bad.  I wish he could fly or something.  That'd be swell.

No more drama.  I've had enough of drama.  Drama can go have sex with itself.  A lot.

Ok, that's all folkies.

"event","...and school is almost done (one final left), which means that Katie will have the free time to attempt to tan, go to the beach, possibly Great America, and have bbq's all the time.  That is exciting.  I'm glad school is almost done, except that it means that I need to prepare for next year.  Here's the low-down.  I need to finish all of my required classes in one year.  That means, I'm taking a crap-load of classes.  For example, my fall quarter looks like this: Brass 1, Woodwinds 1, Class Guitar, Choir, Social issues in education, Comparitive Religions, Elementary music methods, practicum (which is basically beginning student teaching with an elementary school), and Choral Literature.  Thankfully, I'm getting out of my musicianship classes with a placement test (Dr. Westerberg is my hero).  My other two quarters look just as bad.  But, it will all be worth it once I graduate.

My boy is out of town at a lake house right now.  He is a good boyfriend.  He lurves me.  And he took me to dinner at a restaurant that has valet.  It was exciting.

The musical is coming back.  Since I don't have much to do until Grant Park, I figured I could use the free time to work on the musical I was writing.  I'm refined the concept to make it more ""spamalot"".  Hopefully, this will be fun.

My friends are the greatest.  
-Christ= She makes me food and can now kill bugs and dogs.  I'm proud.
-Col= She's my favorite car buddy and a very sweet drunk.
-Ann= She sticks cheetos up her nose and does NOT dance like a chicken.
-Laura= She grabs my boobs and likes musical theatre (and could be my soulmate).
-Liz= She shops at Discovery and actually finds decent clothes.
-Ralph= THE WORLD'S GREATEST DRUNK!!!
-Mike= He knows more about X-Men than Stan Lee.
-Kevin= He looks good with slicked hair and draws on my walls (but then denies it).
-Music School friends (Randall, Jack, Chris, Anthony, Christy, Yuona, Sarah, etc.)=They keep me sane throughout the day because Depaul hates me, but they do not.
-Everyone else= They are all awesome and special and probably extremely exciting drunks.  yup.

"event","I'm such a moron.  To think that I could graduate college on time after transfering was the dumbest thing I could've possibly ever thought.  I'm becoming desperate.  I am willing to trade in my insanity to get out of college on time.  No matter what, that won't happen.  I have to student teach, and I don't have the prerequisites for it.  Which means, automatically, that I'm one year more in the hole.  On top of that, there are two required classes that I need to take.  Both of them are only offered in the fall and are at the same fricken time.  Of course.  Depaul would do that just to squeeze a few more thousand dollars.  And by a few, I mean over 20.  

I'm such a brat.  I HAD to go to the elite expensive school.  I HAD to drain my parents of money that they can't spend.  I HAD to be the selfish, stupid, music student who needed to study with the best.  And the worst part, they aren't the best.  My voice teacher, with only two students, doesn't have the time nor the concern for my voice.  My choir director is from Hades.  The students either look at me like some horrible music student outcast or a nice piece of ass.  

I also still need to get a job.  With all my parents are paying, I need to be able to at least feed myself on my own, do my own laundry, have my own drinking money, etc.  And yet I'm waiting.  Why?  I wish I could tell you.  Maybe I'm afraid that I'll have no time (which I won't after Grant Park begins this summer).  I don't know what it is, but I need something.  Something that is flexible, and something that won't drive me crazy.

On top of everything, I feel horrible complaining in the first place.  There are so many worse things going on with my friends and family, and I'm concerned over a stupid school.  A school that a lot of people would love to go to.  My stupid guilt trips and money issues hold no bar to illness, death, heartbreak, etc.  I'm luckier than I ever imagined and yet here I am, about to break out in tears over a few extra years in school and some beer money.  I am a brat.  I need to get over myself.  I need to buckle down, get some perspective, get my ass in gear and figure out a plan.  I need to take ownership of these actions and do something about it.

It's time to put on the ass kissing boots and start shmoozing some Depaul professors.  If I'm going to get anything done, I need to have them on my side.

Sorry, this is my ranting and raving.  I'm good now.

"event","...are the most gorgeous, amazing singers I have ever seen/heard.  They remind me of why I love European men.  Download their album and find pictures of them.  My favorite=Urs.  Yum...

I'm currently at home waiting to go back to school for a voice lesson/art class.  As of recently, I haven't been able to sing very high.  I mean, I was sick a few weeks ago...but that was then.  It could be because I sang when I was sick, and it's still tired from that.  But still...I have auditions soon and I need to sing high.  

Auditions include: 
February 8-Grant Park Chorus (summer Chicago choir)
February 15-Solos from Mozart's Mass and different Mozart opera scenes.

Wish me luck.  I hope I get SOMETHING.

So yesterday, as my courage would have it, I quit the Blue Angel.  I am no longer a hostess/victim of slight sexual harassment.  It's nice to know that I wouldn't have to deal with some of the asshole regulars ever again.  It's not nice to know that I probably won't get paid under the table like that ever again.  Damn.  Thankfully, George took it rather well...I mean, he didn't have a choice, but he could've had a bitchy fit.  

With that in mind........I cannot WAIT for next weekend.

Things I like right now....
- Il Divo
- Monteverdi
- My bed
- Maddox (as always)
- Urs (who is singing this second....AH)
- Coffee and brownies
- The fact that I don't have choir for the rest of the week

"event","So I haven't updated in a while, so here I go.  Um, let's see.  We'll break this down into sections so I don't get confused.

According to my last entry, I was about to leave for my trip on a cruise.  Well, I went and came back.  This is how I break it down...
+ Away from cold weather
- Rainy/slightly chilly weather all week
+ Many bars to drink at.
+ A hoppin' club called The Chamber
- Skanky ho's at The Chamber
+ Cool wait staff/bartenders for dinner time
- No boys around my age
+ Swimming with stingrays
- Getting hickeys from stingrays
+ Seeing a spidermonkey as a pet
- Breaking even at the casino
+ Breaking even at the casino
- Missed my friends
+ Love the fam

New years was awesome.  Katie got super drunk, as well as the rest of the crew.  I had a few party fouls, but I made up for it in cool moves.  Sutor, Col, Scott and I got much closer.  I saw too many boys in their underwear.  Ok, I don't really know why I'm telling this since the only people who read this were there.

School started up again.  I have early Music History (Medieval through Baroque), Aural Training, Voice, Choir, English 2, and drawing.  My drawing class is kinda fun, and I'm actually not as bad as I thought I was.  Well, I'm not good, but at least I'm not horrible.  Music History is interesting...unfortunately, it's at 8:30 in the morning, three days a week. Ouchies.  

Musical was put on hold.  I'm returning to it soon.  It will get finished.  I promise.

Jonah is gone.  Stephen's brother is moving in tomorrow.  Craziness.

Tomorrow, we are going to my old stomping ground to see June/JV.  Should be a good time.  I guess we will see.  I sometimes miss ISU.  Maybe I'm slightly a Redbird at heart.  Maybe not.

Ok, I have nothing else.  I'll report back later.

"event","I am currently trying to find ways to keep myself busy while I wait for a Mr. Thomas Scott to come home from Arizona.  Seeing as he missed his first flight and needed to take a later one, this hasn't been an easy task.  I could clean my room, but that would take all day.  Instead, I took Maddy to Petco and got him some new litter for his box, a christmas bone and some training mats so we don't have to pick up his poop every 8 seconds.  I also sewed up the holes in his bed so cotton won't get everywhere.  I took an extra long time getting ready.  Jeez, what else do I have to do?  So what did I decide.....let's UPDATE.

Last night, Christina and I went to the Beat Kitchen to see Blacktop Mourning.  I have no issues going to shows, unless they're a band where I haven't seen any of them in atleast a year and one betrayed my friendship.  The worst part is....they're actually pretty good.  I hate that I lost one of my best friends, and I hate that I do miss him sometimes.  He was a great friend (minus making up rumors about me and him).  But he understood me, and I him.  We were both the people that the other would go to for advice and problem-solving (math, as well as life).  We didn't say anything to each other at the show, but kind of pretended that we didn't see each other.  You know, I'd walk by and he'd start talking to someone right away; He'd walk by and I'd take an extra long sip of my beer.  You get the idea.  It's just unfortunate that things had to end the way that they did...and because it's been so long, I don't know if we can ever be friends.

Let's see....

hm......

Um, I'm leaving for my cruise on Sunday with the family.  I'm excited to be heading towards sun, 2 casinos, 5 bar/clubs, a spa, an ice skaing rink (strange, I know), a rock climbing wall (again, I know) and no snow.  It'll be nice to spend some time with the big sister and brother.  It'll also be nice to watch my brother lose all of his money at roulette while I rack it up (with someone else's money, of course) in craps.  And we can watch my mom get tipsy, which is always a delight.  I come home Friday, just in time to spend some time with my quality boys who are home from tour.....again.  

I love Christmas.

Excuse me, I love Holidays (forgive my lapse in political incorrectness).

I love my warm fleece.

I love my puppy.

I love you.

Maybe not.

It also feels good to see sharpie-covered boys breaking cardboard posters over their heads, wrestling with each other, trying to get naked, making drunk phone calls, and eventually, puking almost anywhere they could find (including a vaccuum...hm).  Anyway, last night, even though I got little sleep, I still had a good night.

"event","I couldn't think of anything good to put as a ""subject"", so I thought I'd just tell the truth.  My room is messy....thankfully not smelly though.

Not too much has happened.  I finished my first quarter at Depaul with 3 A's, an A- and a B.  The B was in voice lessons...you'd think I'd do well.  I guess not.  I got super sick a couple weeks ago and my voice jury (final) was not completely pretty.  They went pretty easy on me though, so I was grateful for that.  I got the A- in composition and my first piece is FINISHED.  Well, atleast the voice with accompianment is finished.  I'll let you know how the orchestration goes.

I got to see some friends who came home.  It was nice to see Sutor, Papa P and the Bo.  I don't really realize how much I miss them until they come home and I remember how awesome they are.  It was a lot of hanging out, some good pasta, interesting stories, strange insights and a 6am intimate discussion at an IHOP.  

Thanksgiving was nice.  We had 18 people at our house this year including my family + grandpa, my godparents and their kids, my godfather's parents, and some random friends of different family members.  All in all, it was very nice.  My godparent's kids (Jessica-22, Christina-7 and Joe-4) were awesome to hang out with.  I took Jessica out on Friday night to downtown and we had some drinks.  I now have an awesome summer trip planned, so if anyone wants to drink, camp and float down a river drinking with hundreds of college kids...well, let me know.  Christina is the most socially intellectual 7 year old I've ever met.  She knows how to get what she wants, not by crying and whining, but by negotiations.  Damn, I didn't realize how much she's learned from me.  And Joe is the most book intelligent 4 year old EVER.  Not only can he read perfectly, understand how to play board games meant for 10 year olds and write, he also knows how to draw using horizens and depth and he can name a dinosaur for every letter of the alphabet (my personal favorite, xenalopolasaurus)(I think that's how it's spelled).  Yeah, the kid's smarter than me.

Went to Milwaukee to see the boys play.  Christina and I were the weird-ass chicks who were drinking in the stall in the bathroom (yeah, she's NEEDS to turn 21).  Still, always interesting to hear the conversations of scenesters (and on one account, listening to them pee like a fire hydrant).  We got to see Packo and Boucher.  Fun boys.  And someone (no names will be mentioned) was informing us of how to trim ass hair.  Yes, unfortunately, I still remember this conversation.

Someone comes home in 15 days.  I am excited (and a little nervous) to see him.  But I think it'll be ok.  I guess I really don't know how I feel.  It's confusing to decide something about a person if you never see them.  So, in the end, I guess I'll decide how I feel when I see him (Wow, I actually just went through that...I'm lame.  I would just delete it, but I'm too damn lazy to edit).

Tonight, Christina and I are seeing Harry Potter.  For people who really know me, I'm super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super excited.  Apparently, it is awesome.  I guess we shall see.

Here's my advice: If you're going to make bold statements and promises, you might as well back up your word.  If you don't, you just leave me with less to respect.  That is all.

I don't know what else.

You all have a wonderful day.

Later,
Katie"

The only thing that they've done right is a wonderful technician (who will remain name-less) gave me free cable in my room.  He's a good soul in a corrupt system.

The musical is still going rather slow, but making good progress.  I finally have a good concept of how to write accompainments, so, well, we're getting somewhere.  I'm going to need help from my friends (aka the people read this) for some lyrics, so be prepared for a random phone call/entering of bedroom (christ).  

This is kind of a boring update.  But wait for it.....

I SAW WICKED YESTERDAY!!!!

Holy crap, my life has changed.  1) I feel more determined then ever to finish this musical because if I can do anything half as good as what I saw yesterday, I'll feel accomplished, and 2)everything about the production is amazing...the costumes, the actors, the set design, the music, the lighting, everything.  I can't begin to imagine how long this took to put together.  I love seeing amazing musical specticles like that because it reminds why I'm doing music in the first place.  Oh, and I also found my lead last night.  Kristoffer Cusick.  He plays Fiyero in Wicked, and my god, he's perfect for my lead.  He's hot, he's got a beautiful tenor voice and he can dance like a...a....good dancer.  In 3-4 years, he's mine.  And we will be famous together.  Yay.

I just realized that I'm probably not going to graduate on time.  I wouldn't have such a problem with it except that Depaul is fricken expensive and my scholarship is up at the end of senior year.  I also don't feel that smart, even though I know it's not my fault.  I can't help that the ISU music school has prepared me for shit at Depaul.  Oh well, nothing I can do about it except keep working.  *sigh*

Um, I love Maddox, except when he shits and pisses everywhere.

"event","In reference to the title of this entry, that song has been in my head since the weekend due to 80's power hour.  

On Wednesday, the University Singers has their first choir concert.  It's a tribute to Opera, I guess, because we're doing all opera choruses and scene's from Operas.  It should be a very good concert, but quite long.  Everyone should come and watch me, cute straight and gay choir boys, and hear some great singing because everyone in my choir is fricken awesome.  AND my cute choir boy has a solo, so come watch him too.  

My musical is going very slowly.  It seems that I know how I want things to sound, but I can't exactly get it on paper.  Tonight is going to be a hardcore session of writing to get the next part (the bridge) down.  After the bridge, I just need to repeat the chorus twice, make a descant for the lead and 4-8 part harmonies for the chorus and end the song.  Then I'll be done....with one song.....out of about 20 or so.....great.

The past couple weekends were fun.  Lots of drinking, lots of rooftop time, and lots of, well, more drinking.  My birthday was 2 weekends ago.  Yay, I'm 21.  I got rediculously drunk all weekend, sang Journey at a restaurant, and watched my mom take 3 shots.  You can't get much better than that.  I also got to see Ashley that weekend, which was awesome because I haven't seen her since the summer.  We had some drinks, went to Clarks (where we were the preppiest kids there) and talked of life, love, and more alcohol.

-So tonight we had family time in the nook.  The 3 ladies thought it was time to a)take out the trash because Jimmy won't, and b)spend some time together without the neighbors since we've been with them everyday since they've moved in.  I guess I can't get enough of those guys...they're like ""a breath of fresh air"" as Christ would say.  
-I'm super nervous because tomorrow/actually later today i'm meeting with my music composition private teacher for the first time.  I'm nervous because I really don't think my stuff is that good.  I've had this idea for a musical in my head for so long, but coming out on paper makes it look, well, not as good as it sounds in my head.  I just don't want to look like an idiot.  That's all I've been doing here at Depaul so far.  I'm trying so hard to look like I belong, but it doesn't help that I'm being dropped back to sophmore year classes because ISU prepares you for crap when it comes to music.  With choir, it's a competition every rehearsal.  Since most students are performance majors, everyone wants to prove that they're the best.  The downfall is that there isn't that much of a great balance between parts and even people in the choir.  
-Debbie and I are starting to work out.  I'm super sore.  The guys upstairs had a little secret competition to see who the best back-rubber is.  Jonah took the gold.  
-This Friday, we are hosting a party at our apt.  Possibly, the guys upstairs, the trekkies next door and Cullen and Ambra upstairs are letting us use their apartments to have one gigantic complex party.  The party is to celebrate Debbie and Liz's 21st birthdays.  Hopefully, the plan will get sorted out, but if you're in the area and I know you, please stop by.  It's going to be off the hizzle...or apartizzle. 
-Why do I sometimes talk like I'm black?  I'm from Park Ridge.

I think that's all for now.  I'll come back later with more random thoughts and updates of my oh-so-fabulo life.

Sleepy,

Unfortunately, change happens, whether we mean it to or not.  Situations make people react in certain ways; it even makes them look different that what they appeared to be.  It is up to you to decide whether they've changed as a person or just finally showing their true colors.  

I've realized that things have changed among people I know.  Relationships have changed, the ways we percieve each other have changed, and amount we seem to care about all that have changed.  Whether we want it to or not, again, it just happens.  No one's fault, no one's the victim, it's just life.  I have no doubt that I do have the greatest friends I could possibly find, and it kills me even more to think that I'm losing that.  I hope I'm wrong.  I hope I'm just stressed about other things in life and trying to distract myself.  

I don't even know why I'm writing this.  I think I'm just that bored.  Either way, atleast you've gotten a slight glimpse at what goes through my head.  If you care, then you'll enjoy this.  If you don't, then why the hell are you still reading it?  Oh well, time to drink again.

A little drunk,
Katie

P.S. I swear I'm not an alcoholic.  Well, I don't think I am at least."

"event","I'm just in an ughish mood right now, and I'm by myself (well, with the dog too).  We were supposed to have a girl's night; get really drunk, watch sappy movies and play board games.  But, something came up and that didn't end up happening, so here I am.  

Ok, so I have a complaint about this quiz I saw on the internet.  It's a quiz to judge whether you're a ""music nerd"" or not.  I was curious, so I took it and realized that whoever made this quiz hasn't an open mind about music at all.  Question after question about rock music 70's and on filled my head with the belief that music is skewed nowadays.  First off, knowing all that information doesn't make you a music nerd.  It could possibly make you a rock music nerd, but even then, not a single question reflected how rock and roll got started or gave credit to anyone prior to 1970.  Secondly, I'm slightly insulted by the idea that only knowing rock music makes you a music nerd.  This may be judgemental, but I can guarantee that half of those people who took the quiz knows nothing about other types of music.  Classical, Jazz, even pop are neglected, and frankly, it's an insult to people who do appreciate that music.  I study music all the time...even when I don't mean to.  I'm constantly conducting to myself, analyzing voices and instruments, and when I'm bored at work, I compose in my head.  I like to call myself a music nerd.  Believe me, I don't think that I'm better than these people, but I do find it an insult to them and myself that these genres of music are being left out.

My other aggrivation has to do with people who write or say ""Music is my life.""  This sounds judgemental, and if it is, I apologize beforehand.  Either way, I find that not a single person who puts that is completely right.  They may think it is, but it isn't.  If music was someone's life, that's all that they'd do.  Do these people not go shopping, hang out with friends, go to school, go to bars, etc etc?  My homework and even some left over time is put towards the analyzation, performance or composing of music.  But even so, I still have time for other things.  I work, I hang out with my friends, I go to parties, I play with my dog, I go out to dinner with my parents....well, you understand.  The point is that when speaking about music, you can't talk like it's everything in life.  Music is a wonderful thing, but it shouldn't consume anyone's life, and I don't think it ever has.  Even Mozart was a genious in other academics besides music, and he studied those as well.  Everyone loves music, that's not deniable, but it also isn't the only thing that people live for.

....if you can't tell, I'm a bit stubborn and intense about music.  I apologize if anyone is offended.

I think that's it.  I may write again after I get drunk and watch Degrassi.

Vented out,
Katie"

"event","I just got back from work.  I started at 8 in the morning.  It's not around 10pm.  Yeah, I worked 13.5 hours...approximately.  I feel like jamming a pen in my eye.  Or better yet, jamming a pen in the eyes of people who will bitch because I seat them at a booth that is too close to an air vent and they might get cold.  This is advice for everyone out there....if you are seated at a restaurant, STAY THERE.  Don't bitch, don't ask for a booth and don't say it's too cold.  If you do that, you will be seriously disliked and I will come burn your face off.  

This isn't all hateful though.  I'd just like to give a thank you to the people who kept me slightly sane during my day by having a conversation with me that wasn't about work (even through texts).  You kept me from doing serious damage to my boss.

In short, today sucked.  

Sleepily signing off,

"event","So I thought I would let out my frustrations about my day.  Work=sucks, Dentist=worse, More work=ugh with a side of ugh.  But in the end, I can say I'm very happy.  Law and Order does that to me.  I thank TNT and USA for making me feel better after any kind of day, and I don't think they'll ever understand that even though they may play reruns, those reruns make my life.  Yes, I'm kind of sad.

Thank you to an awesome person who stayed up with me very, very, very late last night.  I may have gotten little sleep, but I did get a lot out of my head.  And it's nice to actually express my feelings to a person, not a journal or through a song.  Either way, I know that you can always learn something about someone, no matter how long or well you know them.  Christ, you're one in a million.

I'm tired....I have another long day of work that starts very early.  

Yours truly, 
a surprisingly happy person (aka Katie)"

"event","So, my first update. I feel like I should be inspiring and maybe even enlighten the world, but I'm too tired for that.  So we'll just update my life.
Last night, I went to Northern with a bunch of people for a birthday.  Lots of fun, but not enough drinking on my part.  Debbie, having the luck that she's had this past week, got sideswiped by a drunk driver, who also almost ran me over in the process.  She broke her hand, and not surprisingly, was the most calm about it.  We got to see some of the schaumburg folk up there too, which was nice.
Work sucks.  Well, it just sucks because I'll probably have to work a 14 hour day (minus the 2 hours I'll spend at the dentist's office).  If anyone talks to me tomorrow, I'll probably be very cranky.  

People don't surprise me.  In fact, they just make me more frustrated because they're so predictable.
(sorry, I had to have a slightly emo portion of this so I could feel like the ""in-crowd"".

Alright, later people.
Katie"

P.S. Clark's soups and salads are very good, but filling.  I do not suggest that for a light meal.  

k. thanks. bye!"

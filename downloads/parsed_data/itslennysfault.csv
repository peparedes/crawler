"event","sooooooooo.... stuff... umm i'm moving out in august... I'm poor... i'll be pooorer... stuff happens... Friday I went with my mom to see Chicago/Earth, Wind, and Fire  at the new Northerly Island Pavilion in Chicago. It was honestly a really good show. Earth, Wind, and Fire reminds me of watching a Prince on stage... but kinda like several princes.. crazy non-stop dancing and moving in fancy glittery/frilly blouses... for a while both bands were one stage.. at one point I counted 24 people on the stage simultaneously producing music... good stuff. Chicago got a new guitarist which was cool 'cause he was really young (like 24) and was obviously metal influenced. Several times through the show he'd play riff's that were already in the songs but he re wrote them and added harmonics and some seemed like they were transposed to minor key's... long story short it went form Chicago to something that sounded more like black sabbath then back again sometimes. blah blah blah


blah blah blah blah blah... life sux... blah blah blah 3 am... should be in bed... blah blah blah umm... yea...

and thats my story... lenny..."

"event","I finally bought green day's american idiot... if i had to sum it up in one word.. it'd have to be ""WOW"". but since this is live journal i can type as much as i want :-)... I just am so happy to see a band REALLY putting everything into an ALBUM... I say album 'cause most of what bands put out now-a-days is just a single (or 2) and 10-14 additional crappy songs that they whipped up last minute to fill space (or so it seems). I think anyone who hasn't bought this CD yet should. It is a CD that is truly worth the money every song is good and the whole cd is a work of art begining to end you can really tell that they worked hard on it. I honestly think if there was a list of the best 10 albums ever made it would have to be on there... oh yea and Jesus of Suburbia (track 2) is especially amazing... ok i just needed to ramble on about how great it was for a bit... i'll stop now..."

I'm actually quite thankful... thankful for the family i still have left... thankful for my wonderful girlfriend... and of course it's christmas so thankful for material possessions... this is the first christmas in years that i've been not depressed...

in less deep/thoughtful news...
So Christmas recap... I got a kick ass king size bed and satin sheets (ooohhh yea), and Tivo which is really cool for the main big things. My mom got a great deal on a 60"" TV and i found a 400 watt surround sound system on sale and got it for my step-dad... and got Dance Dance Revolution for my sisters so add it up... DDR+60"" TV+Dolby Surround = :-)

and now a message to <lj user=""brachasaur""> ...ok i know u want my girlfriend... i know u wouldn't admit it before... first of all ur a pussy for not just telling the truth... i knew... but no u had to spit propaganda about not wanting to be anymore than her friend etc..etc... but thats not why i'm pissed.. u don't owe me shit... however... asking someone why they're even alive just because they won't leave their boyfriend for u when u ask them... thats just fucking rude... i hope u rot... *sigh*... *yawn* ... ok back in my good mood

"event","This is not a joke... Steve sent me this link and it's honestly very scary... basically it is a bunch of really smart people that say we will hit ""peak oil"" in the next couple years which means we have used 50% of the world oil supply... which means that oil gets really expensive... the economy crashes... problems occur at an exponential rate... and within the next 10-15 years the global population is projected to go from 8 billion to 500 million

he wrote a book and it's free (to download) 'til november...

read more yourself: <a href=""http://www.lifeaftertheoilcrash.net/"">Life After The Oil Crash</a>

oh yea and if you download the book he covers pretty much every alternative soloution and why it won't work.. basically the guy is a lawyer who got out of law school a couple years go found out about this. Then he did what lawyers do (researched it) and realized he wasted his life in school and went crazy and devoted his life (thus far) to researching this.

if you pray... now might be a good time"

<tr><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" cellpadding=5><font color=""#FFFFFF"" size=+1>""TO HIS COY MISTRESS""
By Andrew Marvell (1621-1678)</font>
<font color=""#FFFFFF"">
Had we but world enough, and time,
This coyness, lady, were no crime.
We would sit down, and think which way
To walk, and pass our long love's day.
Thou by the Indian Ganges' side
Should'st rubies find: I by the tide
Of Humber would complain, I would
Love you ten years before the flood,
And you should, if you please, refuse
Till the conversion of the Jews.
My vegetable love should grow
Vaster than empires, and more slow ;
An hundred years should go to praise
Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze ;
Two hundred to adore each breast,
But thirty thousand to the rest ;
An age at least to every part,
And the last age should show your heart ;
For, lady, you deserve this state,
Nor would I love at lower rate.

But at my back I always hear
Time's winged chariot hurrying near;
And yonder all before us lie
Deserts of vast eternity.
Thy beauty shall no more be found,
Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound
My echoing song: then worms shall try
That long-preserved virginity,
And you quaint honor turn to dust,
And into ashes all my lust :
The grave's a fine and private place,
But none, I think, do there embrace.

Now, therefore, while the youthful hue
Sits on thy skin like morning dew,
And while thy willing soul transpires
At every pore with instant fires,
Now let us sport us while we may,
And now, like amorous birds of prey,
Rather at once our time devour,
Than languish in his slow-chapt power.
Let us roll all our strength and all
Our sweetness up into one ball,
And tear our pleasures with rough strife
Through the iron gates of life :
Thus, though we cannot make our sun
Stand still, yet we will make him run.

"event","I've decided I'm bored with updates about my life on here.. and I doubt too many people read them or find them intersting... so I'll bore people with my thoughts of tonight.. carrie and jimmy have already heard them 'cause i was talking about them tonight at round the clock... umm yea.. time to just ramble as stuff comes back to my mind...

It started when i was driving to round the clock.. one thought led to another and i began to think about how i'll never forget my grandma's phone number 'cause i learned it when i was like 4 'cause she used to pick me up while my mom was sleeping during the day (she worked nights). That led me to thinking about when i was little and would always go see my grandma and grandpa and just have fun at their house. Then (since they are both no longer 'with us') I started thinking about death/life etc. Which led me to think about how every Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second... or more importantly every moment/event in the timeline of our life has it's own little life span, birth, and death. It's just rather depressing that every moment that happens happens once. No matter what we do time keeps going at a steady pace and nothing (with exception for Einstein's theories about time travel) works to change that and all the money or possessions in the world can never buy back time. Then what are we left with? nothing but the memory of what happened 'before'. That is usually said as something to cheer people up. ""just hold on to your memories"".. etc.. etc... However, memories are really not good. The really sad memories generally make us sad, and the happy memories well they make us miss what was good and in the end tend to make us sad. However, without them there is nothing to say that the events happened. Memories are in many ways just like almost everything else. They might be bad for you now and 'cause bad feelings (or some times good i guess) but generally it's unhealthy to dwell about the past. Then, we get old and forget everything and we'd give anything just to remember 'the good times'. Basic rule... you ALWAYS want what you can't have.. the grass REALLY IS greener... and time never stops. ok enough ranting about nothing... now a quote and a good night...

"event","ok so work.. meh... it's rougher now.. but the fun times are more fun... skate boarding in the mall... playing super nintendo up stairs... listening to wesley willis be obscene on the store speakers really loud... riding billy's electric scooter through the mall... harassing people that walk by... throwing legs from manikins at eachother... playing bozo buckets with super balls and manikins legs as the buckets... throwing knives, saw blades, and parts to clothing racks through the wall we spray-painted the bullseye on... breaking stuff in general... and hopefully soon laser tag in the dark in the mall... so yea.. the little bit harder my job is now is definitely out-weighed by the 1000x more fun we've been having.. and thats saying alot 'cause i always had alot of fun at this job...

..enough about work.. i got off today at like 7pm and went online... kinda hoped lissah would be online and maybe i could do something with her (Even though i told her yesterday that I wasn't gonna see her today) then called carrie... turns out we're not doing stuff for her B-Day 'cause of everyone we know is poor and/or job-less. So now i'm going up to the good old BG (Buffalo Grove.. huh? no one calls it the BG.. i just did that for no damn good reason)... to vestans house... should be fun...

another pointless update... courtesy of:

"event","ok.. so today.. pretty much sucked just 'cause of work.. i'm so tired.. blah it sux... moving an entire store isn't easy... ok enough bitching... band practice went pretty good.. and I got to see lissah for a little bit today.. and in that short period of time i managed to upset her, but we're fine now I think... I hate upsetting her.. I love her so much.. ok on to other news... I would be in bed right now, but... I GOT MY VIOLIN IN THE MAIL TODAY!!!... mwahahahaha.. so I took it out of the box and played with it for like half an hour.. kinda falling asleep while doing so. Then finally I got it to make A noise.. yea i know it's sad it took me 30 minutes to get it to make a noise... Violin is waaay harder then i hoped .. I knew it'd be hard... However once I got it to start making sound I was able to play Mary Had A Little Lamb (and then she ate some more). I'm so proud. There's hope for me figuring this thing out yet... Everything I've read says u can't learn it without lessons 'cause it's just that hard... so i'll be stubborn and try anyways.. but then I'm gonna eventually give up and take lessons I'm guessing. YAY! for violin... ok now YAY! for sleep i'm so beat...

"event","today.. sucked soooo bad... I worked soo fucking hard.. it's ridiculous.. i slept like 2 hours last night.. went to work.. my shop caught on fire for those of u who don't know... and we're now moving into the old Ward's in the mall near by. It sucks so bad all day was ...load 3 trucks as full as possible... drive them approx 1/16th of a mile (if that) and unload all 3... Ward's is HUGE.. which means carrying furniture a long distance from the trucks... then repeat... I've had some rough jobs and months at a time that i worked 12-15 hours a day.. and i'm far more tired and sore right now from one day then any of that... but.. i have tomorrow off so everything will be ok.. i'll sleep til like noon wake up go to school do registration stuff.. then go get lissah...

ok now.. despite the first half (except for the last part of the first half) being on such a negative side. I just have to say right now my life is good. I'm comfortable, happy, basically dealing with the normal life stress.. no biggie.. normal life. I have a great girlfriend and some friends. I'm content. However, I don't think one person in my life is and that makes me sad. It seems that almost everyone (I say almost 'cause there has to be some exceptions) I know has some sort of huge bullshit drama. THIS IS TO NO ONE PERSON 'CAUSE IT APPLIES TO 90% OF THE PEOPLE I COME INTO CONTACT WITH. My advice to everyone is as follows:
<ul>
<li> life is far too short anything that you can just look over and move on.. just fucking do it.

<li> Friends, Boyfriends, Girlfriends.. all though individually special are all expendable... ""I realize 
that everyone who lives will someday die 
and die alone."" -Brand New (yea shush about the quote source). Myself I am very happy in my relationship, but to other people (a message I wish I could've told myself in past situations). Sometimes.. it's just not worth it and you can probably find some one better.

<li> However, to contradict the last piece of advice. Most things that come between people don't matter that much. So there is a simple process of making a decision and just ""fucking deal with it"" -Chris. You want people in your life (you can just look over it) or you don't (you can't)

<li>There is no reason anyone should have an above average stress level over stupid shit. So basically, Summarizing all above... All things that can't be worked out.. or looked over.. are obviously expendable.
</ul>

I feel so preechy... I'll leave it.. who knows it could help someone.. and maybe offend some people.. whatever...

All I really wanted to say is ""Cheer up EMO kid"".

ok I'm off to bed now. Need sleep BAAAAAD!!.. I'm amazed i've been up this long (and it's not even that late)

Posting on LJ (WTF),
Lenny

PS.. sorry again if this makes me seem like a dick.. or if it offended anyone.. that was not what I wanted at all.. it's really just a rant about everyone being so down all the time I just wish i could make everyone happy (but for the most part I have nothing to do with it)"

I just wanted to say it's been awesome being in a band with you and that I wouldn't be 1/2 the guitarist I am today if it wasn't for you. More importantly you've been a great friend and i'm really gonna miss you man... I hope to see you soon on one of your, hopefully frequent, visits.

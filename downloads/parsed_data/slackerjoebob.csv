"event","I just woke up so if I don't make alot of sense (not that I ever do), that is why.
So.  Seanna seems slightly worried... LOL.  This updates for you!

Have you ever dreamed in thought?  Like.  It's not a dream at all, you're just thinking?
That sounds weird, but that's what I did last night/this morning.  It wasn't even important thoughts, it was just me updating my journal (must have felt Seanna gettin' antsy).

So anyway.  What have I been up to?  Working mostly.  Conspiring with Danielle.  We registered @ Kohl's and Target for wedding things.  Sleeping.  I've been so tired lately, I can't explain it.  I've been going to be fairly early (well, earlier than normal).  Maybe my body's in shock at having slept an actual eight hours.  I swear, give it an inch and it takes a mile...

I actually RPed with Ais last night.  I have to confess, I haven't stepped foot in IMC for a good while.  No particular reason, I just... Haven't.  I've been converted to AIM, I guess.  Though it's really hard to write posts how you want them in AIM.  One really good posts takes at least three IMs.  Then it's broken up and not really the same... LOL, I'm so picky.
So, anyway, I got the post out that Ais was due.  She is so good to me.

Damon, I should apologize.  I feel like I've been giving you the lamest excuses and it's not that I'm all ""No! Can't play with Damon!""  I just... Yeah.  Haven't felt like playing.  I promise, I just sit around making icons all night, I'm not cheating on you. Hee.

And dearest Seanna.  There's another Sienna.  Every time I talk to one of you I spell it Sieanna and have to go and fix it.  I have your entry as a memory.  I read it and it's wonderful, but I have to read and re-read before I can really get a feel.  I'll sit down after work today and see what I can come up with.    I'm so glad we're doing it the way we are.  I'm more used to controlling one person.  Give me more than one and I'll have it going ever which way.  Also, it's occurred to me... If you've sent me any e-mails... I don't have them.  I have this horrible habit of deleting everything that I don't recognize... So. I might have deleted something in a hurry without realizing it was you.  Also did you want me to post mine as a comment to yours or just have a separate entry?  And does it have a title? LOL  I'm so out of it, anything you've told me has left my brain...

Anyway, do you have AIM?  I think I've asked this five million times, but I don't remember.  If so, my SN's slackerjomanda and it might be easier to talk about the story and all of that through there.

And.  Since I was asked, <lj-cut text=""Playlist Meme thingie"">

1. Total volume of music files on my computer: 1716 songs, 4.5 days, 8.28 GB
2. Last CD I bought: I've bought so many, but I'll go with Jimmy Eat World, Futures.
3. Last song I listened to before doing this meme: Hallelujah,  Jeff Buckley
4.Five songs I listen to alot:

The Tension and The Terror, Straylight Run
I Met A Girl, Zach Hexum
Collide, Howie Day
Flying High, Jem
You're So Damn Hot, OKGo

5. Five people I want to do this meme, if they feel like it and haven't done it already:

Quicky! Someone tell me things about Texas!  Hey, guess what!  Ben McKenzie graduated from the same high school as the Bush twins.  He was a senior when they were freshman.  That's the extent of my Texas knowledge.  Unless you count the basic...

I am only a state above Texas, you'd think I'd know more.  But all I know is that OU has a rivalry with Texas?  Or. Maybe it's A&M? One of the teams.  OSU used to be an A&M.  That's why we get called Aggies sometimes.

So they're doin' their thing and they get ready to go at the same time so she says hi to him and... THEY SPEND LIKE THE REST OF THE NIGHT HANGIN' OUT. This chick. AND JIMMY FALLON.

I just got in this huge argument with Sarah and told her to leave me alone and that I was done with everything.
And here I am trying not to cry over the whole thing.
And desperately trying to keep RPing through all of it (which is sort of funny, really...).

I just want to yell and throw things.  Too bad I don't have a lawn chair to through in my non-existant pool.

I can't even begin to explain it all.  She just started talking about me taking Jon's side and then she brought Mitch into and I couldn't take it. I don't want to talk about Mitch, I don't want to deal with.  Not where she's concerned.

So I just took myself out of the equation.  I knew it'd happen some day. Just not... today."

But that's all it would have been.  One day that was probably just a fluke.  Because now I'm back to pissed off.

In a nutshell, she' decided she shouldn't talk with Jon because she's still in love with him and thinks she'd have the wrong intentions.  Which, is actually good thinking for Sarah.   However, she doesn't want to tell Jon this she just wants to stop talking to him. I didn't really say anything, none of my business all that.  But then she IMs me freaked out because she had wrote up this e-mail and instead of saving it as a draft, she sent it to him.  And wants me to tell him to delete it because I'm more believable? No.  I don't know what she ended up doing, telling him it was a virus or something.  Who knows, I'm trying not to care.

Anyway, the question is... 
Oh hell, I don't even know.
I don't care. It's her life."

I feel better.
OC tonight! Whoo!

I've not been able to sleep the last three nights since Sarah called. Incidently, I didn't get sick until she called as well.
I've already thought of Away messages to use should she not show up. Wanna see a song that fits us wonderfully?

<lj-cut text=""Seventy Times 7, Brand New"">Back in school they never taught us 
what we needed to know 
Like how to deal with despair 
or someone breakin your heart 
-Twelve years I've held it all together,
but a night like this is beggin to pull me apart.
I played it quiet left you deep in conversation
I felt uncool and hung out around the kitchen 
I remember I kept thinking
that I know you never would
<b>And now I know I want to kill you
like only a best friend could</b>

Everyone's caught on to everything you do
Everyone's caught on to..

As if it happening wasn't enough
I gotta go and write a song
just to remind myself how bad it sucked.
Ignore the sun, covers over my head
Wrote a message on my pillow that says
""Jesse, stay asleep in bed"" 
<b>Don't apologize - I hope you choke and die
Search your shelf for something which to hang yourself</b>
They say you need to pray
if you want to go to heaven 
But they don't tell you what to say
when your whole life has gone to Hell

Everyone's caught on to everything you do 
Everyone's caught on to..
<b>(and I can't let you let me down again)</b> 
Everyone's caught on to everything you do 
(and I can't let you let me down again)
Everyone's caught on to..

So is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with
Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish
I've seen more guts in eleven-year-old kids
Have another drink and drive yourself home
I hope there's ice on all the roads
And you cna think of me when you forget your seatbelt
and again when your head goes through the windshield

Is that what you call tact?
You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back
So let's end this call and end this conversation
And is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with
Cause you left the frays from the ties you severed
when you say ""best friends"" means friends forever

Is that what you call a getaway?!?
Tell me what you got away with
Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish

Because. She took my first love. Because:
""I started talking to him to see if he liked you and then... I started liking him""
For those that are thinking ""OMGoodness, Amanda, that was in 8th grade -- time to move on.""
Well. Let's just add this little bit of info:  she broke up with him after two weeks (one of those weeks she was camp). Next day -- found dead. Hung himself. AT THIRTEEN. And that's where the bitterness is. Because, I became very close with him even after she started liking him. So it was more than a silly crush.

So. When I say took my first love. I mean it in more ways than one.

Also. She's a bulemic alcaholic potheaded cokewhore.  In her defense, she's been clean a year an' a half. But. Doesn't change the crap she drug us through before then.

And. No matter what. No matter who. No matter how old. She ALWAYS CHOOSES THE GUY OVER ME. 

And. I just. Can't do it anymore.</lj-cut>

Everyone has to relate to that song. On some level.

So. Another thing:

There's nothing to do here.
She's gonna get here and find out how boring my life is.
I'm poor and have no life. I doubt she'll want to go comic hunting...
Oh goodness, what if she wants to go to the mall?
The mall always makes me think of Avril Lavinge. Randomly.

Y'know what? She's coming to see ME.
I can choose -- she's on my turf, or something.
Whoo.

This won't end well. I can feel it.
We aren't even real around each other anymore.
All we do is dress up and make ourselves pretty so that we can pretend our lives are better than the others.
So fake.
I wanna cry.

No one is gonna be there.
I almost want to IM Jon and have him come with her. Then we wouldn't be alone.
But I know she wants it to be just us. Which is why I DON'T. Ugh. We're gonna have to talk about crap and I'm gonna make witty and sarcastic comments until she says something dumb like, ""Are you mad at me?"" (everyone who asks that <i>knows</i> the answer).  Then I'll have to say yes and yell. Maybe not yell. I'm not good with the yelling. I'm better with the calmly and flatly telling it like it is.

Maybe.
Maybe If I pretend it's not real...
Like. It's just some script...

That's the dumbest thing I've ever said.
See how desperate I am?

Ugh, this sucks."

It is supposed to be oh-so-relaxing, but it is just the most frustrating thing I've ever done.
All I want is a cozy for my iPod and some nifty wristbands.  Black with red stars.
That's all.

Oh well.

I was called in to work today because the chick that was supposed to pick up Britney's hours didn't show.
Then I was asked to stay late, just a few hours.  Which is fine because I need the hours, but then Andy comes over and seriously wants me to stay until closing.  So. I wouldn've been there from 1:00pm to 10:30pm.  Not to mention that tomorrow will be horrible and that Friday I managed to get Britney's hours again (which, again, is okay.)
So no days off for me.  Which doesn't bother me. Just. I ain't stayin' there that late if I have no time to rest from it.

He even tried to bribe me with a purple bracelet. Which, was actually quite tempting.
See, there's some new thing corporate's trying and if you do certain things then you get certain bracelets. I have all but the purple one. And he knows it! And how much it bugs me. That I don't have it.

"event","Boy. Today was an interesting day.  Work-wise anyway.

See, our LP guys (Loss and Prevention), they transfered to a different store for a promotion. And. I don't know if we haven't replaced them yet or the news just... suck. Or. What. But. Since Brian and Joe left:

An employee tried to steal belts by stuffing them in a shoebox.
A fellow cashier used someone's SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER to look up their charge account to use it (she no longer works for us).
That was the weekend.

Today,  five kids ran out of the store with armful loads of crap.
However, Brian (our manager, not LP dude) chased 'em and five other dude kinda surrounded them and so two were caught and bunch of the stuff recovered.

And this lady from India (only say that because it was obvious we weren't understanding each other) kept yelling at me for ringing up too many items. Or. Something. She didn't like her price.  It never fails, last customer is the worst.
So, I keep explaining it to her. I go item by item and show her the price and add it up and then add in the tax. Nope. Nothing.  So my line is huge, I have to call a back-up cashier and then anyone available to ring so there's not a riot.  And the whole time she's telling EVERYONE ELSE in line about my 'screw up"". So I finally call a manager and make HIM explain it to her.

Something clicks when HE says it.

Ugh.

So. Anyway. At least now I can pick up extra hours 'cause Britney's been fired.

Other than that...
Had dinner with Lynn, bought the new Atticus and Unwritten Law CDs.  I wanted Jimmy Eat World, but they didn't have it.
So. Yeah.

And I tried working on my knitting thing...
Yeah. I don't think I was made to knit.
However, my cat loves the yarn."

I had a dream about Billy Joe.  And. Well, the other dudes from Green Day, but mostly Billy.
I got to watch them practice and then I talked with them about tattoos and my lack of them.
THEN! I wasn't me anymore and the person that traded with  me got to make out with Billy Joe. SO SAD.
Simply 'cause it wasn't me.

But. I was only dreaming of him 'cause I fell asleep reading Sandman and, well, they look alike.
Ironic that Sandman is, well, Dream, ruler of the Dreamworld an' all that and I DREAMED about him.
But. Tha's only 'cause Mack an' I were talking about how Billy Joe looked like Dream.

Seriously, if ever a Sandman movie was made, Billy Joe would be perfect.  And. Amy Lee would make a perfect Death.

I do believe this is now my favorite comic.  Even though I've only read Volume One, but it can only get better.
Plus, Constantine made an appearance.  Which, leads me, to...
I should read those comics, too. 

Cause in Sandman, he had <i>blonde</i> hair and was from London.  So now I have to find all the other differences.
Changing the country/setting, I can see.  And. Well. Keanu seemed to have the attitude and personality. So. I'd drather his hair be different than (oh god) they dye his hair.

Chas was older, too.  But Shia LeBauf (or however it's spelled)  played him perfectly from the few pages I read.

I like Vertigo comics, I decided. Tho. I'm still in love with Forsaken from Image.  My goodness... beautiful style.

"event","So.  Aud had this away message up, that was taken from someone. 
So I took it.
It reds like this:

<i>Stolen from Aud who stole from someone else:



Wait for a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will lie under the stars and listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep...wait for the one who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when your in sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you're just as pretty without make up. One who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky he is to have you. The one who turns to his friends and say, ""<b>that's her</b>""</i>


So it's my new Away message because Lynn does all of those things.  My moment of cheese if you will.

I sign on today and look at my good buddy Jon's away message and if it wasn't the same thing!  He even pasted the <i>Stolen from Aud who stole from someone else</i> part!

Except at the bottom of his, he wrote:

<i>i once did all those things that manda recites.  i've found that it's not only if the man does all of these things.  it's also whether the woman deserves what the man has given her.
</i>

And.  So. I didn't know how to respond.  Because. I'm pretty sure the person he did all these things for/to was Sarah.  And his heart was broken and smooshed and ground into so many little lifeless pieces after she left that... yeah. It made me sad.  But, y'know, she didn't deserve Jon.  That sounds weird since I am the number one member of the Jon and Sarah Belong Together club (and, yes, there is more than one member).  But. At the time, she really didn't.  She went away to college and did her wild college things and thus proceeded to tell him about said wild college things over the phone.  Then he went to basic and when he called her back she was so fucked up she couldn't remember who he was.

Yeah, so if THAT didn't add to the heartbreak.

But, y'know, she's sober, he's learned his listen and they are still friends. Yayness!

Now.  Why would I want him with her after all of that?  Because before all of that... OMGoodness, just.  Wow. Meant to be. Best Ever. Movie-like.  So.  The thought is, she's sober now.  So. She's ready.  But then, y'know...  She's not.  And he's not gonna let her hurt him.  Which is muy great.  Because I'd have to get all Hulk on her and kick her ass.  Yeah, you don't wanna see me turn green, baby.

Anyway, tho... Whoever is finally deserving of Jon. Luckiest chick on the earth. He is just so wonderful and great and awesome.  He is like me in man-form.  Only he makes sense and is hot.

And by luckiest I mean besides me.  Because Lynn is the bestest of the best.  And Jon can be second in the platonic bestest of the best way."

I don't have to tell you what my Desktop looks like now.

I feel like I should have more to say, but I don't.  Not really.

Lynn has an opportunity to change jobs and work with a friend as a transporter at one of the hospitals here.  Which isn't bad, but there'll be a pay cut.  But the benefits/hours are better.  So. I dunno, pros and cons.  I told him we'd be able to work thins out financially if he wanted the job.  So he's going to apply tomorrow and take it from there.  I can't complain because I'd really love to have him before midnight and I'm sure he'd love to be able to hang out with his friends more.

Hm.  Randy (Lynn's stepdad) told his uncle that only ate one meal a day.  I've met his uncle maybe... twice.  Not the thing I really want announced.  Especially since it's <b>not true</b>.  Unless you figure in that we see Randy and Lynn's mom once a week for lunch. So, when they see me, yes, one meal.  However, I do eat outside of them. -eye roll-

My gramma is mad at my mom.  She doesn't think she helps out enough.  First off, my mom lives out of state.  And her job requires her to travel all over Oklahoma.  But she still spends at least two out of five days a week with my gramma.  So. Considering everything... that's pretty good.

My gramma is one of those people where if she's upset or has to do something she doesn't like, she finds some way to blame it on other people.  So.  Since my gramma is going to have to move to Arkansas (where both my mom and my aunt will be retiring), it's my mom's fault.

Nevermind being old and ill, no, it's all my mom's fault.  Times like this, I don't feel bad for saying mean things about her.  But, y'know, they aren't mean when they're true.  They're just sad.

I guess that's it.  I saw the clip for The Rutles 2 with Jimmy in it.  It was hilarious.  It's kinda a Beatles spoof, huh?  Anyway, it'll be added to the list of Jim things I need to buy.

I saw my friend Julee today, she stopped by on her way to Branson.  We exchanged Valentine gifts and had lunch and then she went on to Branson.

Lynn's gonna have a week of vacation so if he stays with Wal.Mart, we're gonna use that for the honeymoon.  Assuming we'll be married. -L-  Two indecisive people should never be put in charge of planning a wedding.  Even if they're the ones getting married.  We have no clue what to do.  All we know is that we need money and that we don't have money.  Hence, no marriage."

"event","The OC rant will be short this week.

Sandy is dumb.  
Lindsay is boring.
Marissa will soon be heart-broken.
Woo-hoo Kirsten!
And.  Poor Cohen.

And one more thing?  Zach telling Summer he didn't think Seth would ever be over her?
DUH.  The boy was in love with her since he was ten.  He named a freakin' <i>boat</i> after her.  If he was in love with her before she knew he existed and for the five seconds she did, was grossed out by him?  Yeah.  He's gonna be in love with her now.  Since they've dated.  And she's a normally human being.

Okay, I'm done.

I have to get a birthday present for my niece (it's her first birthday!).  And I have to think of something for Lynn's Valentine's gift.  For my birthday, I got a gift card to Olive Garden and one to the movies... So I told him we'd use those (we're poor), but I don't want that to be all.  That just seems lame to me.

I ran up 150 dollars on my credit card. The card I said I'd never use.  That very one.  So that's what this check'll go to.  I'll have to keep a better eye on things.  Usually I only purchase one or two small things just so it looks like I'm really good at paying things off...  I went a little overboard this month. -L-

My gramma (the one I said was so horrible to me a few entries back)... Yeah, they thought the cancer came back...
So I'm feelin' a little bad. -L-  However, it DIDN'T and she just... I dunno what it is.  Her bladder is not emptying correctly do to scar tissue?  It wasn't really explained to me.  Anyway, no cancer just a really bad infection.  So I called her and made small talk and let her know I had tomorrow off if she needed anything.

And... what else.  MY MOM IS NOT ANSWERING HER PHONE! Grr.

Sarah.  Is gonna stay with Mark and go to couples' couselling.  When someone steals your money... it's beyond therapy.
But whatever.  She said s he's moving out when the lease is up so she can come back and go to school here... Something about just wanting to leave on good terms...

Who knows.  I've told this child over and over she needed to leave, she was welcome to stay with me if she needed a place, etc., etc.  Told her to quit making excuses for him, and got her to admit to all the ""red flags"".  But. Rule Number One (Or.. Two?) You have to want change.  She knows she's in a bad relationship, but if she doesn't want to do anything about it... I can't change it for her.

Stupid nerd.

And I say that out of love.  It's just... frustrating to see someone you care about settling for... that.  And really, I can see her point.  She's in school there and it's too late to transfer or get her money back.  So she might as well just finish the semester and then move home.  Plus, I dunno.  Who wants things to end badly? I guess.

Whatever. It's her life.
I'm sure people think the same thing about her and I's relationship.  She screws me over constantly and I still answer the phone. So.  Pot callin' the kettle black. I guess.

I want the SuperGirl bra at work.  Randomly.

Lynn left his hoodie here so I might steal it for the day.

I'm kinda stressed over apartment hunting...
We need a two bedroom because of all of our stuff...
But even splitting it,  I can't afford much due to my outragously high car insurance. And it just...
makes me feel terrible.

I'm not that worried because everything always seems to work out for us. I just feel bad that Lynn will have to pay more (there's no way around it) because I was a horrible driver.

But.  We're waiting until my next statement because it's supposed to have dropped and then we'll go from there.

I had/have fourteen points on my liscense.  That's the max you can have in OK (told you I was awful).
Once it starts back up (you pay four months and get two months off) then half of those will be gone.  Leaving me with seven. And they said the cycle after that, I'll have three more removed. So.  That helps some.  But I know insurance companies, they don't always lower it to what you'd like.  But I mean... <i>seven</i> points, surely that'll be a big difference?

Guess what? I read the MJ trade (Mary Jane comics 1-4) and there was an OC reference.  Whatshername was like, ""Try dating someone more realistic, MJ -- like someone from the OC""."

"event","Well.  I spent most of the day looking for apartments.  Lynn and I are gonna move in together when our leases are up so I thought we'd at least kinda get an idea... All the good ones are too expensive... -L-  But at least we kinda know what we can afford and what we can't.  It's not like we are in any hurry.

What else?  Well... Lewie, (aka <lj user=""amanda5_19"">) said she'd watch the OC tonight to see why Danielle and I are always blathering about it.  I think that's a big thing 'cause there's also a game on.  So.  Yay for Lewie!

I had the oddest dream last night.  It started out as a normal dream and then towards the end... the people where replaced with the cast of SNL (Maya, Horatio, <i>Jimmy, Will Ferrell,</i> and <i>Tracy</i>, and maybe some others that were just... fillers -L-) doing this sketch (I'm assuming).  It was so funny that I woke myself up laughing.  I know that sounds retarded, but it's true.

See.  This girl really liked Will.  And so Maya decided that she should declare her love for him at the party (they were playing kids and it was in a backyard).  So.  Her and Jimmy  (even though he's not thrilled about it) help her come up with how she'll do it.  So then everyone gets there and Maya introduces the girl.  Will's kinda confused and asks where Jimmy is (because Jimmy was too busy pouting to show himself -- though, I think he was hiding in the bushes?).  So then Tracy was like, ""Man, he di'n't show"" (y'know, in his cool voice).  So then the girl declares her love.  In turn, Will sings to her (remember the song he and Parnell did the <i>Tonight, I celebrate my love... to you...</i>, yeah that one).  THen they all go inside and make out something.  I guess.

I really have to stress the song.  Because he did almost exactly the sketch where he and Parnsey sang.  Soooo funnny.

Cut to inside.  Horatio interrupts Will and tells him someone wants to talk to him outside. Dun dun dun, surprise, it's Jimmy. I can't describe how adorable Jim is.  With his hands all shoved in his pockets and lookin' like he does.

So.   They make small talk and then Jim admits that he didn't come because he jealous. THEN -- he bursts into song (this is the funniest part even though it just sounds retarded).  And so he's singing broadway style about how he was in love with his best friend so he couldn't make out with anyone and that his best friend didn't want to upset him so they couldn't make out with one and how it really sucked because that meant that no one got to make out.  Because he was in love with a dude.

Then. Will and Jim make-out.  In that sketchy kinda way.  Not in the guy-on-guy way.  And not in the Afleck and Seth way.  Just.  The way that Will makes out with everyone. Way.

I know it sounds incredibly stupid but it was the funniest thing ever and I've been singing the <i>Tonight, I celebrate my love to you</i> song all day.

P.S. Here's some boring stuff about...
<lj-cut text=""why my shoulder hurts""> So.  My shoulder hurts.  Like the muscle between the shoulder blade and my neck.  And.  It sounds stupid, but I thought it was because of the computer.  See.  I've had a laptop and so I don't have to position myself like with a desktop.  So I thought maybe it was just sore from being the same position too long... But then, while moving things around at work it just.. I cannot begin to explain.  It burnt and there was shooting pain down my forearm.  It hurt so bad I was nauseous and wanted to cry.  

So I knocked myself out with some OTC aspirin thing that said <b>PAIN RELIEVER</b> really big.  Then yesterday I wore one of those thermal pad things on it (they're not just for cramps anymore!) all day and it didn't hurt at all.  But now.  I'm back at the computer and it's gettin' a little sore.  So. Back to it being the computers fault.

So.  If I'm not around.  It's because my shoulder forbids it.</lj-cut>

Lynn's gonna take me to Ricardo's for dinner and then we're gonna watch Joe Verses the Volcano.
Yaaaay."

So thank you.  To those that gave me something to do.

Actually, taxes aren't hard. I just... can't find the IRA part?
You'd think it'd be with the rest of the stock stuff...
Maybe they send it separate. Since. Technically they're two different accounts?
Stocks suck.
Well they dont.
Because in the end, I'm gonna be one rich pimpin' motha (I can't believe I just said that).
But. Y'know. Keep up with all of it is just... tiresome.

Lynn totally ditched me tonight to hang out with his friends.  Really. He didn't ditch me.
He called and said they wanted him to hang out and I said cool. He hardly ever gets to spend time with them.
So yay.  Video games and I don't have to sit through them!

I cleaned some today.  As in, I picked up all the trash.  There's at least five trashbags that are just waiting for Lynn to carry them down to the dumpster...
I'm a slob, what can I say.
I might do the dishes, too.  I'm gettin' pretty bored.

But. Also.  I might watch the first episode of the OC.
Angsty Ryan is so hot.
I'm glad we agree.

Wanna know how bored I was today? Besides the cleaning...
I organized my Desktop.
I organized my icon folder.
I uploaded all my icons (well, I reached my limit anyway).  As well as made sure they were all credited (except my default because I don't know who to credit -- I did put a note in my keywords for someone to tell me so I can credit tho).
And then I linked the userpics page thing with the webpage thingie (which isn't as confusing as I make it).  So now, everyone can see what icons I have currently and make sure they are all credited.  I don't know why you'd want to do that, but I saw it on someone else's journal and we all know Manda's a follower.
So there y'go.

I had dinner with my mom and gramma.
My gramma and I don't get along.
Well. She thinks we do.
But I, on the other hand, still think she's bitter and selfish and rude.
However she's my gramma. So.  Yeah.  And now everyone can tell me how mean and cold-hearted I am for saying such things about my gramma.   But. Y'know. I lived with this woman. I know her passive-aggressive, backstabbing, and manipulating ways.
And even though we're better now that we don't live together.
Personalities don't change.
Especially when they've had eighty-some odd years to settle.

Anyway, she's my gramma. I love her despite how it sounds.  So. I just suck it in and move on.
And vent about it in my livejournal.

It was good to see my mom though.

So...
other than that.
Nothin'.

I have to be at work at 8AM tomorrow.  And then 6AM the next two days.  But I'm not at the register for those two days so it's not that bad.  I don't mind getting up early if it's just little projects or price adjustment things.  It's getting up that early and dealing with customers that I hate.

And.  That's it.  I've made, like, three entries to-day.  S'how bored I am."

Music Industry Sues 83-Year-Old Dead Woman


CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - Gertrude Walton was recently targeted by the recording industry in a lawsuit that accused her of illegally trading music over the Internet. But Walton died in December after a long illness, and according to her daughter, the 83-year-old hated computers.

More than a month after Walton was buried in Beckley, a group of record companies named her as the sole defendant in a federal lawsuit, claiming she made more than 700 pop, rock and rap songs available for free on the Internet under the screen name ``smittenedkitten.''

Walton's daughter, Robin Chianumba, lived with her mother for the last 17 years and said her mother objected to having a computer in the house.

``My mother was computer illiterate. She hated a computer,'' Chianumba said. ``My mother wouldn't know how to turn on a computer.''

Chianumba said she faxed a copy of her mother's death certificate to record company officials several days before the lawsuit was filed, in response to a letter from the company regarding the upcoming legal filing.

``I believe that if music companies are going to set examples they need to do it to appropriate people and not dead people,'' Chianumba said. ``I am pretty sure she is not going to leave Greenwood Memorial Park (where she is buried) to attend the hearing.''

A Recording Industry Association of America spokesman said Thursday that Walton was likely not the smittenedkitten it is searching for.

``Our evidence gathering and our subsequent legal actions all were initiated weeks and even months ago,'' said RIAA spokesman Jonathan Lamy. ``We will now, of course, obviously dismiss this case.''

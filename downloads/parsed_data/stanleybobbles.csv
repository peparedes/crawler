With the soul of a gypsy queen,
And the brightest eyes that I've ever seen.
Gave her two murderous hands,
And two legs with the devil's dance.
At last gave her half of my heart,
To make sure that we would never part."

"event","I once dreamed that I walked through a mohave desert toward a rising son. I saw the horizon and my face in the same moment. It wasn't like a split screen, they were just one. 

I was so scared. Almost like I knew what was coming.

I lifted my face and eyes up toward the waning night sky, and thought it odd that I could still see stars. It didn't take long for it all to gradually and freely begin to blur. It was like I had been dreaming in my head, but I was awake in my heart.

I began crying long before I woke up.

And in those last moments that I had left on this earth, in the desert where I was raised, I would have shut my eyes if I thought that it could be done in a dream. My feet left the ground swimming in that refining light. Effortless, focused, and without pain.

That doesn't mean that I didn't scream with the lungs of a thousand fallen angels.

I could have extinguished a flame with the force of my body rising off of my mattress. In the time it takes for you to find your first breathe after being diagnosed with consciousness, the earth will lose it's salt. I called it prophetic, and thought it redeeming...and you're wondering how long it took me to make all of this up.

I need to find some oil for my lantern."

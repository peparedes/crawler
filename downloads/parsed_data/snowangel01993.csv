on saturday i went to maine and it was so fun. 

After my sisters soccer game on saturday we went up to maine. Driving was soooo boring. When we got into maine it was still raining so we drove around York beach and watched the surfers for awhile, then we took a scenic rode to Ogunquit, drove around Ogunquit, then a road to Kennebunk and Kennebunkport and then we drove to Portland. When we got there, we checked into our hotel, unpacked in our room, and then we walked around the city, shopping for awhile, then we went to a place on the water for dinner and it was really good. After that we went back to our hotel room, i did my sisters hair. Then it was really late so i went to bed. The next morning, i showered and then we went over to a baking company and got pasteries for breakfast, and they were sooooo good. After that we walked around Portland for awhile and then we drove up to Freeport, went shopping and then we ate lunch. Then we drove to Welsley to pick up my dog from my grandparents house, and then we came home.

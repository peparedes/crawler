"event","I'm thinking of starting a Lj community where basically, if you need help with anything (ie, I'm currently stuck on the best way to save money for a trip over seas in a few years), the members will try to help and or give advice. Mostly stuff like I just mentioned in the ( ). But I'm not sure if I want to do this alone.

If anyone wants to help I'll do this. But only if at least one person offers to help."

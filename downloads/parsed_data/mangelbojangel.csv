I have 5 minutes left on the computer so I will be brief.

The flight was pretty uncomfortable, but I watched The Queen, Arrested Development, Extras and Family Guy.

Finally arriving was fantastique, David waiting at the airport with roses, public displays of affection and then taxi ride into the city.

Day one spent in bed, napping and other activities, went to the Bastille, walked around, dinner with David's famaily, fun time.

Day two was the Louvre (so many Americans!), walking around a lot and tiredness.

The hotel is small but nice.

I am living off bread and cheese and it is delicious.

I am picking up many phrases already.

""..Hello?""
""Curtis!&nbsp; I just got tear-gassed at the Bastille!""
""What!?""&nbsp; It took a few seconds for me to register the glee in his voice.

"event","So I finished my University Preparation Course on Saturday with the exam.&nbsp; Hurrah!&nbsp; I think I did fairly well in it, wrote everything I needed to<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;in my allocated time<sup>2</sup>, and even had ten minutes at the end to read through my paper and fix up the mistakes.&nbsp; All this on little to no study!&nbsp; Now I don't need to feel guilty for playing <em>Baldur's Gate</em> all evening.&nbsp; And I can read books purely for enjoyment's sake.<br /><br />I celebrated in the evening with Thomas' 21st, proving myself (along with Osmond) to be his only true friend.&nbsp; I didn't realise I had to go dressed up, despite the fact that the invitation was emblazoned with <em>Miami Vice</em>/<em>Vice City</em> pictures, which was a shame, because everyone looked stylin', and I looked kind of plain.&nbsp; It must be noted (for all those concerned)&nbsp;that Thomas was looking very well - all pink and healthy - Wyong life must be doing him some good.&nbsp; Started the night at The Teagardens Hotel in Bondi Junction, with beer and vegetarian spring rolls.&nbsp; Tom's brother and sister then took us to the Beach Palace in Coogee, and Tom and I had no idea how to behave in the world of straight nightclubs.&nbsp; The boys there were really hot though, and you could tell that they all really wanted to have sex.&nbsp; But I was too fearful to stare at any of them for too long a time.&nbsp; We eventually got kicked out of Beach Palace, because the bouncer thought Tom was asleep.&nbsp; We were denied entry into the Coogee Bay Hotel, because they thought we were drunk; denied entry into Randi Wix's (perhaps the seediest-looking nightclub in Randwick) as well as the Coach &amp; Horses nearby.&nbsp; We then drove into the city to go to Jackson's on George, which was also quite seedy, and they tried to kick us out because Tom knocked over a drink, but we eluded the bouncers until we got too tired at 4am and went home.<br /><br />The sleep only just caught up with me this morning.<br />_____________________________________________________________<br /><font size=""1""><sup>1</sup> Four essays: a close analysis of an unseen poem (which turned out to be a Shakespeare sonnet), an exploration of surviving trauma in <em>Beloved</em>, the dramatisation of desires in <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, and analysising the characterisation of Anne Elliot in <em>Persuasion</em>.<br /><sup>2</sup> Three hours, plus ten minutes reading time</font>"

"event","So Friday night was the Christian Students Uniting Presidents party.  The theme was Greco-Roman Mythology, so naturally I went as Narcissus.  Much wine was consumed, many pictures taken, and very little was worn.  And I won Best Dressed.  

Saturday night was Jiao's 21st/farewell, however we (we being Kristina, Mayuri, Anne and Dave) were all late due to the TROUTS Cabaret.  David was the MC, so we had to watch, and then the bar tab hadn't been reached, so we had to get sauced on bourbon and coke.  We got lost on the way (from UTS to Surry Hills) and got to the pub at 11:45, but we got barred because all pubs in Surry Hills close at midnight.  So, we waited on the cold footpath for everyone to come out.  Jiao and Alex gave me awesome birthday presents (<i>Jonathon Strange and Mr. Norrell</i> by Susanna Clarke and <i>Extras</i> on DVD, respectively).  Then we went to Oxford Street to eat pide and drink tea.  Everyone was dressed up for Halloween.  I'm dying to go to a Halloween party sometime, just so I can dress up as Harry Potter.

This Saturday is my exam.  Three hours of English Literature, and then hopefully I get a place at uni."

So, because I have no time to get stupid photocopies verfified, I missed the early cut-off date for my UAC application last week, which means I have to pay a $94 late fee on top of my $45 apllication fee.  Bastards.

Working full-time is a real drag, but the money is great.

"event","<p>I'm not really sad, but I am kind of. I am mostly just disappointed. In others, in myself, but I guess there isn't anything I can do, anything I can regret, I can only keep pushing forth. I am grateful for the experiences I have, because they teach me more than any lecture, religion or book could ever teach me. I am at a loss of words right now and I don't really know what to do, I suppose I can just take everything in and decide later. (deep sigh). Hopefully when it isn't 2am I'll be able to analyze this situation and my life with a clear state of mind. With a clear vision. I don't want to judge, I really just want to understand. I want to understand why this makes me sad, why it doesn't make others sad, and why I was put into this situation. Did I choose this? Is this fate? It is probably a little of both. <br /><br />This probably doesn't make sense to most of you reading this. In fact, probably everyone that reads this won't understand, but I'm sure you can relate it to some part of your life, somehow. right?&nbsp;<br />-----<br /><br />wow. I was really emotional in that last blog post. I think it was because I posted at the peak of my emotion. Anyway, I think I figured out why I was sad, I was sad because a chapter of my life is closing, which means that I am seeing my past and future collide, which means I must say farewell to many habits, people and material things. Saying goodbye is always difficult for me. <br /><br />Anyway, Today I went to a congregational church with Chris. I enjoyed it, but I will dedicate a post to it later on this week when I am bored and/or trying to distract myself. Right now I am trying to focus myself. <br /></p><div><em></em></div><div>There are just SO many sex articles on BBC News that are distracting, like about <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4662042.stm"">abstinence</a>, <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4669104.stm"">sex chemistry</a>, <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4396230.stm"">makeup and hormones</a>, the list goes on.

"event","I have officially decided to change my life for the better.&nbsp;


I love myself and I love others. I am finally going to follow through with it. I said it before, but I don't think I really wanted to make a change. Now I do. Finally.&nbsp;


""When you want something enough you'd do anything to have it, it is yours""


I am going to take charge of my life like never before. I do not care if I lose ""friends"" along the way. If I do not fit their definition, oh well.&nbsp;

When you get close to people they begin to define who you are supposed to be. In reality, they never know who themselves are. These type of people have unintentionally prevented me from knowing who I am. If we keep defining each other, we can never fully define ourselves.&nbsp;So I will take my past with grace and know that everything is a learning experience. I am going to stop doing things for others and start living my life.&nbsp;I have been given a life, I do not know why, but from my knowledge I only have one, and I have been given enough&nbsp;consciousness to make my own decisions and I am going to do just that.


I am not trying to become a ""hermit crab"" or ""anti-social"" or any other label but I just want to figure out who I am and what I want before its too late. Before I am 80 years old and still hoping to figure out what I really want, still feeling unsure about why I am doing what I am doing.&nbsp;

Fuck. It took me 19 years to figure out that its a cold hard world and people will squash you gently if you don't resist. I have finally come to the realization that I want to know who I am, what I want and who I have become (and why).&nbsp;


Going on my trip changed my life, although I didn't realize how much until now. I just saw how people live their lives solely based on society's standards and definitions; even choosing whether or not to wear shorts on a hot day. When I saw the way that people were living their lives, I realized that I was living mine in the same way, just in a different context. I was disgusted with myself and who I had become. That is a surreal feeling. Whats more, is that it was the second time it had happened to me. I would usually put this as a private entry, but if someone reads this and it helps them, then good. If someone reads this and thinks it is bullshit, oh well. I am apathetic. I love you anyway."

ok so what i want to get out of my college experience:
-networking
-research opportunities
-learn about the world and problems in them and how to help
-prepare me for the future...which is..

uhm... damn i dont know!! I thought i wanted to be a lawyer, but as i was reading ""law school confidential"" i dont think i'm ready and willing to do it. I don't really want to give up a social life for law school. I want to be affluent and make a difference in the world, but i dont want to neccessarily go to law school or get into politics. I definitely do not want to have a meaningless, mediocre career that only impacts people slightly either. I want to make a big change this lifetime. There is so much injustice and hurting in the world and I would like to help. The only thing is that sometimes I give up on the world, sometimes I get the feeling that people don't want to help themselves and that depresses me. But then there are other times when I see people that truly want to live happier but do not know how. I just wish I knew the meaning of life. But then again if I knew the meaning of life than everyone would work so hard to accomplish it and we would probably become self destructive. Also, it would kind of take the fun out of life. Anyway, back to figuring out what I am going to do with my life...

ok ok ok I can do this. Lets narrow it down:

best paying careers:
-&nbsp;Business CEO
- Corporate&nbsp;Lawyer
- Surgeon
- Engineer
- Computer Whiz.

To be honest I wouldn't mind doing any of these careers but I don't have a passion for any particular one. What I really have a passion for is writing. My dream is to write a philosophy book but the problem is that I have to ensure that this book would change the world positively and make me financially comfortable...simultaneously.&nbsp;

The only reason I wanted to be a lawyer is because it would open a lot of doors and give me a lot of options. Also, I could become a diplomat or an ambassador which I would also love. maybe thats what i'll be. I'll be a diplomat and I'll conduct negotiations between nations. =)"

"event","Today's:


Prepare for a scatterbrained kind of day -- one of those days when you get a silly tune stuck in your head, you have trouble concentrating, and you can't seem to recall names and other information. You might just have to let these things go -- try not to get too frustrated with yourself. Right now music and art hold special appeal for you, but there will be a bit of a disconnect between what your conscious mind can focus on and what your subconscious mind can handle. 

The wisest thing you can do in a situation like this is accept how little you -- or anyone, really -- knows. Once you get that fact through your head, the situation will clear up and you'll see the next step to take.


OH and yesterday's:


regarding me and the boy i met: 
Chemistry can be sudden and inexplicable. You thought you and you-know-who would never click, and suddenly you see how much you have in common. This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.


regarding the other situation:



Approaching conflicts in a direct manner is a wise strategy today. It will save you time and plenty of headaches. Someone who has really been throwing his or her weight around thinks that you've been intimidated to the point of complete obedience -- and won't it be amusing when you show this person that you don't take kindly to being pushed around? Try not to escalate the tension when you make it clear that you have a mind of your own. Be firm but polite."

i'm excited for my trip this summer. i love my sister. 


i'm sad that i'm not into any guys right now. at first i kinda enjoyed not having to keep up and maintain a relationship, but now, i guess i still feel that way but i miss having late night conversations with guys i'm into. i talked to laura about this on sungod and she said that it was because i didnt want to and that i push people away. i agree and i also conclude that i'm self destructive. that makes me sad."

"event","sooo life.... uh. i dont know. i think i am going to stop drinking for a while to see if that helps out my fitness. anyway, i was thinking today about how the rest of my life will pan out. also, i was thinking about how i really must not be comfortable with myself to actually post my journal up and share it with the world. like i wouldnt give the link to anybody. i used to, but it actually is my feelings. in the raw. that is scary to put it out there for the world to judge. really scary. it shouldnt be though. like, if you think about it, you can die tommorow, and the world still goes on without you. yea people will ""miss"" you, but in reality, WHY do we care about such stupid things? why are people so judgemental, and why do i care what others think? i dont know. 


i went to the psychiatrist on campus. he is a fucking idiot. really. he is. like he helped a little, but he was not inspiring, hopeful, or even easy to talk to. i guess they are just giving out PhD's nowadays. 


i need to go do math and sociology homework. peace out."

Sometimes you can be so overconfident that others think you've gone too far. You might even surprise yourself with your boldness. Now, however, you can go beyond your normal limits and get away with behavior that would normally be unacceptable. Trust your intuition and just be yourself. Others are more willing now than ever to accept you just as you are.

A family member might throw you a curve ball today, revealing information that quickly shifts your feelings. You may have become comfortable with your point of view about an issue at home, only to discover that you are wrong. Communication can get quite emotional when your security is at stake. The storms will settle down tomorrow and you'll have a better idea of what to do next. 


it is always right on."

"event","I've been meaning to do this for a while and naturally I kept forgetting. So now, at the last minute, seems to be as good a time as any to get started. Tomorrow I'm going for an ""informal interview"" at the Army Careers Information Office in Chester to get myself moving toward hopefully becoming an Officer in the Royal Signals. I figure it'll be good for me and for anybody else who is interested in this kind of stuff if I keep a journal of my experiences. Especially since I stopped writing in this thing when I started uni and I've kind of lost possibly the best three years of my life to the impermeience of time and memory. And Facebook, I suppose.

So, I'm in bed, at 1am, writing because I can't sleep because my typical routine for the past couple of months has been to play Team Fortress 2 until about 3am, wake up around 11am, think angry thoughts on the subject of being awake, then lie in until about 1pm and spend the whole day doing nothing. Oorah! I've made vague attempts to find a job, and I am learning to drive, but by and large I am doing nothing productive and I feel like a giant loser. I miss Bradford, much as I never thought I'd consign those words to print in honesty, but there it is. I miss that self-contained little uni world. I miss my little sphere of friends and sort-of friends. I miss having my own room in my own sort-of house and having to look after myself by buying and cooking my own food, washing my own clothes. I miss having a cat and a girlfriend and a 20mb internet connection and going out and getting drunk and being able to stumble home and fall into bed. I miss not having to cadge lifts off people or wait for buses. I miss a lot of things, basically, and I hate being back here. It feels like I've spent 3 years working toward this degree, which I promptly fumbled in the last year and only got a 2:2, and working on becoming a better, more mature, more stable and more rounded, happy, and confident guy, making my own way in the world, and I've been arbitrarily plopped back down where I started from.

I used to talk up Manchester in Bradford because I wanted to go to uni in a big city with rock clubs and busy streets and lots of cute girls and drugs and music and heartbreak and love and sit on my windowsill and watch traffic and people thread through the streets. Manchester became, oddly, this faraway promised land that the place I'd come to had failed to become. If that doesn't seem to make any sense, it's because it doesn't. People don't leave their promised lands, and while Bradford was and is most certainly a grade A shitpile, for three years I conveniently overlooked the significant fact of the matter that when I came to uni, it was as much to do with finding that student paradise as it was about escaping the hellish stagnation of Cheadle. Now I've been to Bradford and back, and I'm stuck here again and I have no idea how the fuck I'm going to get out again. I'm struggling to even find work at minimum wage, and a 2:2 in International Relations isn't exactly a sought-after commodity. Oh and, so I'm told, the economy is going into some sort of doomsday recession, the price of petrol is sky rocketing, the climate is changing, the aliens are coming and basically all of western civilisation is probably going to collapse long before I'll be old enough to be told that I can't actually draw my pension because pensions don't exist anymore.

So the Army is basically my egg-carrying basket. I got turned on to the idea when I suddenly realised that actually studying IR radically shifted my stance on a lot of issues. I'm not the angry, misinformed hippy activist I once was. I understand now the complexity of the international system, the problems that lead to security threats and challenges and the very real reasons why we still need a military. Not to mention an understanding of the vague inevitability of how we roll over smaller countries to further our own interests. I choose to believe that despite all this, I am still a compassionate person and that rather than sliding into a sort of justified apathy about the costs of the Western lifestyle, it's more of a balanced acceptence that some things do boil down to better them than me. To clarify, my main mode of thought is that, as a mentally sound young man, of course I'm not OK with human suffering, with abject poverty that some entire nations of people live in while I sit here wringing my hands over how they fit into my world view. Yes, I would much rather see a more equal and prosperous world, but I'm not going to stop there before I start thumping my chest and demanding that change. Change has to come at a price. We already have massive problems with climate change as a result of just under a third of the world being massively industrialised and another quarter or so beginning to catch up. If the entire world were as developed as the west, we'd basically cook ourselves to death in months. Not to mention there's not enough oil and whatever else to go around. So the question becomes, what are we in the West willing to give up to allow these poorer peoples to experience a better quality of life? The answer is not much. Oxfam has to bombard us with TV images of starving children and employ teams of canvassers to badger us into donating just a few pounds a month to them. Would we really be willing to give up, say, our economic stability that once was, or our cars, electricity, computers, cheap holidays?

So yeah, I'm pretty much cool with the notion of fighting to keep the UK in a strategically sound position. I'd also like to break out of this student lifestyle I've been trapped in for the past 7 years or so. I'd like to become more organised, confident and reliable. I;d like to develop the ability to persevere and achieve the things I want to achieve. Most of all, I want to know that once again the next three years of my life are taken care of and get the fuck out of this horrible deadend town. I wanna make something of myself, do something worthwhile and important, maybe even become a great man or something. I'd also like to pick up some background skills and training in communications and IT so that once I leave the Army I can get myself a nice little setup somewhere involving playing with networks or something. I'd rather not have to do another degree, and this way I get to travel and do Army things like carry a gun and wear camo and yell codewords down a radio. It's pretty much all I could ever want out of a career.

Downside is that I'm partially deaf in my right ear. This is kind of a big downside because it could actually disqualify me from military service completely. The uncertainty is killing me. Well, less the uncertainty and more the nagging suspicion that because the Army would be the ultimate solution to pretty much every problem I have right now, the universe is gonna trip me up with the long one here by making me deaf since birth. I won't find out at the interview tomorrow what the deal is because they don't have a doctor there and can't arrange for one, which I find unspeakably frustrating, but I can at least talk it over with Ret. Col Thornycroft and see how soon I can arrange to find out. Also, they said to bring whatever documentartion I could pull together on my hearing loss and stupidly I left it till the last minute to sort out. I asked my a few days ago if we had any files or whatever, and she said we had, but it took till tonight to actually pull them out and it turns out they're all just correspondence and reciepts. So I feel like a total fuck up for again being disorganised and letting something important slip to the point where I can't actually do anything to rectify the situation satisfactorially (see also: Dissertation) and I;'m just having to hope that it isn't going to look too sloppy tomorrow.

It is only an informal interview, but Jay and everyone else have made it abundantly clear that this is a misleading phrase and it's still important to go in a suit and tie, shaved and all squared away. So that's what I'll be doing. I shaved off my beard a couple of days ago and this is going to sound totally gay but I could kinda see a sort of officerness in my face in the mirror without the beard. Maybe what I mean is that I actually looked vaguely presentable. I miss the beard though, because it seems it was covering up a slight pouch of fat that's been slowly growing there through uni, trying to give me a second chin. I'm embarassed as much by it as I am by how vain I've gotten about it. Doing neck exercises like there's no tomorrow. Went out for my first run since uni yesterday inspired in large part by this pseudochin I'm smuggling around. I need to get my stamina and endurance up anyway, so maybe I'll burn away the little bugger at the same time. Fingers crossed because I hate feeling like a fat chick, mournfully eyeing myself in the mirror, and feeling pangs of guilt and self-loathing everytime I eat a chocolate biscuit. Seriously, fuck being fat, man. I'm not even a little bit fat and it already sucks. God, life is going to be terrible when my famous metabolism finally drops down a gear at 30 and my waistline explodes and I have to scramble to keep myself not looking like a sack of shit.

Of course, if I'm in the Army, living the Army lifestyle, doing Army things then I won't need to worry so much about that will I?

"event","I see her standing there, caught in the drilling incandescence of a broken streetlight. Her fibre-optic hair sparkles through the grit, and she looks awkward and alone, the subtle curves of her body drowned beneath a loose vest and a baggy combat shirt. Her skin is pale like dead fish. She is the dirt-girl of slum-city. My sprawl-madonna. A silent drop of sullen perfection that drifts like a bad cell through the veins of the city. She has hardware behind her ear, but you can't see it until she lifts her hair back to slide in another stick of microsoft. And she can handle a deck. All her grace is in the ether. In cyberspace, I've watched her open her wings like an angel. The digital web cannot hold her, she is beautiful and relentless, but on the streets she looks like just another blank city child. Vulnerable and unassuming, passively aggressive.

So I will watch over her.

It's hard to be guardian to an angel. So fragile, yet so powerful. So unrelenting. She compromised our security so effortlessly, even for a slum kid. Those kids practically grow up on the Net and can crack a cipher or bust a firewall at professional level by the time they're 10. But she... she ripped through the external servers in seconds. By the time I was jacked in she was already shredding our internal network. I've been a cyberdog for almost as long as she's been alive and yet she easily overpowered me that first night. Fast and precise, overwhelming and yet not brutal. Violently elegant. The dump shock nearly killed me, and I was seeing stars and hearing voices for days afterwards. It took five of our guys to finally knock her off the system, but word came in later from Tetracorp and a bunch of others that she was back up and inside their systems in half an hour.

Ten to two am, and we're weaving through the packed streets and jagged alleys. Above us, stars glimmer weakly through the city's cracked skin of smog; the air alive with throbbing bass and flickering neon, heaving bodies, the urban pulse. I trail her, uncloaked but armed and alert, never further than 15 feet away. Once or twice I think I've lost her, but with just a notion the nanobolometer wafers grafted onto my retina activate, and I see her as the universe does: only energy. Transient and hot white, billowing from a bright core into nothing in a sea of heat.

She weaves through throngs of revellers, street cops, pushers, fixers and junkies, nimbly skirts the tumourous clusters of youths with shark teeth and crocodile eyes, gang insignias holographed into their skin. The life and death of their turf. We short-circuit the busier streets through hidden footpaths and back alleys, dancing round the feet of monolithic glass obelisks into narrow streets where the sewer steam mixes with the funk of rotting garbage and human waste. And then out into the plaza and into the warm miasma of fragrances and aromas wafting from street vendors and unlicensed cafes. The exotic accents the mundane: Grilled elephant meats, roasted frog and fried chicken, lizard soup boiling over onto plates stained with animal fat. Greasy fingers and spilt drinks.

Outside the transit hub, she stops and talks with a street vendor. I watch, and listen, from across the street, moored to a lamp-post against the constant stream of bodies pumping out of the hub. Once a grandiose work of tile and brick, now sagging and stained with dirt, the station concourse is overrun by sleek metals and glasses slowly enveloping its original form. They stand between two gaping entrance-ways, the ceaseless flow of bodies deflected by an angular pillar. They speak in some strange street fusion of Indian and Spanish, and I only understand fragments. I pick out the words ""Baile silencioso"". Silent Disco. Above them, a holoboard displays a pulsating image of the Virgin Mary. Suddenly, she skews at the hip and is replaced by Shakti. I realise I've lost her in the flickering laserwash. I move casually but quickly across the street, my skull humming with live technology. I pause for a moment by the street vendor, scanning. Have I lost her?

The holoboard flickers again, revealing the pale form of a naked woman with porcupine barbs fingering the uHID port of a new model Nokia and I'm scrambling breathlessly through the sea of bodies. My pounding heart mixes with the flood of sensory input from the thermal vision, acoustic triangulation, magnetic resonance scan, TacScan and passive radiowave/wireless locational implants. The world becomes a burning ocean of cold, metallic tastes, screaming colours, cool radiation. Waves of nausea as my stomach rolls with every movement of my head. I can't see her. My skin tingles slightly as the subdermal antennae click to life in a slow wave of invisibility. My legs compress like pistons as I leap like some mechanical cat into the rafters.

I pick her out again in a cloud of green-hued heat. Something unmistakable about her form and movement. She bobs and slides, around drifting clumps of business men with sharp suits and chrome sleekware, between tourists and the lost. I spring silently from crossbeam to crossbeam, struggling to keep her isolated from the glaring background of bodies. Then she begins to drive straight for the densest parts of the throng, barging through groups of travellers without pausing. I lose her for a what feels like a very long, breathless, moment. Then there's a yell, a fuzzy green, red and blue smudge gestures wildly from the floor near a maintainence door. I'm on the move again, shutting off my implants one by one as I near the door. I flicker back into sight as I drop from the last rafter, almost totally unnoticed admists the perpetual chaos of the ticketing station.

The door opens out into a dark service street, lined with dumpsters and refuse bags from the shops and restaurants on the concourse. The thick lenses over my eyes cast a red glow across the tarmac as I search for her heat. Nothing. Just rats and escaped lesser mutants picking through the waste. I feel my gut tightening at the prospect of losing her. Losing the final piece of the puzzle. The only piece.

I sprint to the end of the street, and look about frantically. The crowds shift past, impassively, occasionally a child or a junkie pausing to stare, slack jawed, at my glowing red eyes. Or maybe at the desperation on my face. Or at the frantic, twitching movements of a corporation burn-out. I shut off the thermals and slouch against the wall, not fully accepting defeat, but still, no idea what to do next or where to go. By sheer dumb luck, I look up at the squat, gold-trimmed form of a Buddhist temple, its heavy oak doors set at the top of a tall, steep stairway that towers above the perimeter wall. I see her there, trudging up those steps, and I'm away. The knot in my stomach slips away, and I snake through the crowd, having to hold myself back from sprinting up the stairs.

Inside the temple she pads across the mats to a huge gold statue of the Buddha. Sitting cross legged in imitation of the idol is a monk. She turns her head to him, and he looks up to her. From the doorway I watch their wordless exchange, then a section of the floor melts away and she descends into a silent vortex of flashing lights. Silent and invisible I slide across the room to the holographic floor. It is solid, but before I can search for a control node, the monk looks up at me from the corners of his eyes.

""You can go no further"" He says slowly, with no force or feeling. I have never met an augmented monk before, so I nod slowly, once, and then draw my pistol and release a suppressed round into his forehead. His body jolts once with the impact, but does not fall. Those calm, dead eyes stay fixed on me. With slow, deliberate movements, his legs unfold into a multitude of spider-like metal legs, raising him up to tower over me. He pulls open his robe to reveal an armour chestplate bristling with various barrels and launchers arranged around a central mini-gun. I dive behind a thick wooden pillar, already mentally plotting the best line of escape. I hear the minicannon's whine as it begins to spin up, and cringe at the foot of the pillar, waiting for the sound of splitting wood and roaring lead, but it never comes. Instead, just the high-pitched drone of the cannon spinning and the delicate clinking of the thin legs against the stone floor. I calculate the distance to the door, a zig-zag path between pillars and idols. I activate my leg implants. At that moment, the clinking stops. Heavy silence. Just the sound of the cannon, the sentinel waiting to take its shot.

I take a deep breath, break from cover and sprint for a side altar. To unaltered eyes, I'm nothing more than a shimmer of heat, twitching across the room, but to the sentinel I am a large and multi-colour mass of heat and momentum. I slide over the altar and dive for a pillar. The temple door is a split second away. Pushing from my right foot I am sailing toward the street. I am crumpled at the foot of the stairs before I can fully register the brief tearing sound and dull vibrations across my back. I climb to my feet and I'm vaguely aware of a large wound above my right hip and a lot of blood running down my legs. I make it two blocks before the nausea kicks in and I find my self slumped on the rough slabs coughing a thick mixture of fluids on to the concrete. I slap on a dermal stimulant and claw myself back into an unnatural and unsteady sprint. Blood falls from empty air as I head for the edge of the recreation quarter.

""Shit, mon!"" Jarvis stares at me in disbelief, a steady stream of blood mixing with the puddle at my feet. I manage to gurgle something like ""help me"", and then his broad shoulders are under my arm and he's leading me past banks of computers and hydropnic vats of hemp spliced with adrenal glands and psilocybin. His thick dreadlocks swat at my face as he heaves me onto the stained operating table, the steel frame cold against my skin between thick leather pads. He asks me something, but there's a loud buzzing in my ears and I can't even tell what it is I say back to him. He probes the sucking hole in my stomach with a bare finger, then walks over to the supply cabinet, shaking his head. I feel his hand on my forehead, and something washes over me, taking with it all colour and detail.

I can taste vomit in my mouth. And someone is jabbering incessantly about something I can't make out. I'm on my back. No. I'm on my front. Slouched. I guess I opened my eyes, because the empty haze is burst by a lot of colour and detail. The JiP is bleached out by a blinding sea of light. Strange, thin creatures of pulsing green, red, blue and black undulating through it like eels. A shoal of them suddenly whip around and drive straight for me. I groan and press my face against the floor, into a pile of what look like lotus petals. Something keeps tugging at my shoulder, rolling me back. It's too much effort to fight it, so I slump over and let my head loll to the side. I cough up another clump of petals, and someone slaps me. The jabbering stops. A medical officer is holding me by the lapels, flitting between murmering at me in a slow drone and casting strobing patterns in the air with his arm. Behind him, on the ceiling, I can see her taking form. Her face, but not her face. An impression of her is all. Her hair slowly creeping out to blot out the light of the ceiling and creeping down to envelop the desks and other deckers. Little prickles of ice cold as it wraps around my legs and climbs. I arch my back and gag and wail as the blackness creeps over my chest and into my throat. I claw my hands at the metal floor and kick my legs, try to cough up more petals, but all that comes is thick, burning mucus. It bubbles up out of my mouth and runs back into my nose.

In the darkness, I am alone. I'm thinking maybe I'm dead when I notice a small ball of light, like a node, and I can't figure out if it was there all along or if it just suddenly appeared. On instinct, I reach out to probe it, and then I hear myself. Screams of inexpressible agony, echoning and overlapping, like I'd been split into a thousand peices. It's deafening and terrifying, yet I feel myself floating and watching, passive, disconnected. The cries of pain turn into a thundering roar of anger and rage. My first job. The day the city got too much for me. Shape hunched in the doorway. The same position for too many days. The same words, people, feeling every day. Things I never noticed. Scratching at my skin in the shower. My forehead against the window. The only real flower I've ever seen. The touch that never lived up to the promise. I feel like a tube has been run into my chest and I'm being hollowed out. And it feels good. So good.

A rapid flickering of ideas and images, too fast to comprehend or remember. A city. A hillside. Just me. 
Just me. 

But not alone.

Conciousness seeping back in.

Thick pipes in chipped yellow paint and Javis' face, bathed in green light, fixed intently on the needle he's pulling out of my arm. He smiles.
""Welcome back, John. How do you feel?"" I take in Jarvis' recovery suite. There are crates and barrels stacked in one corner of the room, and the floor is concrete tile. Thick bundles of cable run in sagging waves across the red brick walls. The bed is an antique gurney, devoid of any native technology. It rattles and shakes ominously as I sit myself up. I wince as once of the sidebars collapses under my weight and clatters to the floor. Jarvis laughs.
""Not on a par with the corporate care package, I know. Can't afford the new models, gotta keep a low profile in my line of work, y'know."" Jarvis' line of work, which he was fond of alluding to, was pharmapiracy. He'd get dead-drops of molecular blueprints in cyberspace, along with specifications for form and quantity. He'd synth the order then take it to a drop in meatspace, pick up the cash and then run off another load of synths on the sly for smaller, local customers. We'd used him in the past, his facilities were invaluable for creating disturbances in the market for various drugs which our own pharma wing could then exploit. He synthed black wares as well, alongside as a few of his own concoctions, which put him in good stead with the using community in various anti-corporate elements. This made him a good source of intelligence on upcoming raids and disruptions. 
""Junkie wallets are loose,"" he told me once, around the crook of a pipe, ""but them lips are looser.""

He steadies me as I pull my pants back on, then hands me a worn leather bomber jacket.

""I fixed your body, but I couldn't do anything for your jacket. Take this."" The arms are emblazioned with patches depicting stylised hemp leaves, mushrooms and pills.

""Put you in a new kidney, Russian model. Good value for money."" He smiles proudly as I dig for my credit chip. ""Japanese Mediplant in there to help with the healing too. Top of the line. Black-market, also very good value for money. Might want to have me take it out for you before your next official check-up. Sealed up a serious hole in your stomach wall, worked some magic with your intestines. They're a foot shorter cause... Sorry mon, this card isn't valid."" He hands me back the credit chip and I stare at it dumbly for a few seconds.

""Looks like you been cut off.""
I hadn't expected them to freeze my account. Eighteen years of riding decks for a company and they cut you off the moment you hit sick leave. How am I supposed to buy food? Unless...

""What are you into, John? You come running in off the street, alone, with a hole the size of my fist in your back. Your company chip bounces. You have the look about you of a man who is into something too deep. What's going on?""
I sit back down on the gurney and take a deep breath. I tell Jarvis about the girl, about getting right on top of her on the net, and her spearing me with her hand. The dump-shock leaving me with this knowing, this intuition. Being put on leave, and told to keep out of the investigation into the hack. Then the silent disco, and the monk. Jarvis locks his eyes with mine the entire time, continues to stare even after I'm finished. Finally, he rocks on his heels, and I know that's he's about to launch into one of his diatribes.

""Street kids get caught up with anti-corporate movements very easily. You know this. They condemn the corporations that scoop up city kids and then sell them on, and then they do the same thing. Use them for their own profit. Train them up as hackers and scouts. These rebels, these punks, they are malcontents and hypocrits. They love the net and complain about life. Blame the man, blame the suit. I love the net, too, John. But I know that the corporations give us the net. Where are all the routers? Inside corporate bunkers. Who own most of the cable? Corporation. So what's gonna happen, I wonder, if these punks get their way, to their beloved Internet? Sure, corporations do bad things on the street, and one time the people were fighting that. It's different now."" I nod like I've been listening and deeply agree with him, and move to stand. I'm about to try to negotiate an alternative form of payment, when he grabs my arm.

""I think your girl is in something big. There's been rumours. Punks have been picking up these kids, they're expendable. Using human wave tactics, trying to bring down all the big servers. Got some kind of virus they going to use, too. Exotic."" He stares at me intensely, like this is supposed to sound like anything but the typical high talk of the streets. Something between his expression and the memory of that face on the ceiling needles me, feels like another tiny sliver of the truth. His eyes flicker over my face for a second, then he smiles slightly and releases my arm.

""How's about you leave that credit chip with me, and I see if I can't work something out?""



Her file was pretty thin. Hanging there, surrounded by the red, pulsing grid. And me on the otherside of several layers of ICE and encryption, spoofing one of the investigation office's credentials. Not much paydirt, but enough. Activity log. A traceroute to what was probably her home or some sort of base of operations. Deep inside the slums. Not exactly a quiet in-and-out job for External. No physical information either, just one jack-in point in a sea of shanties, street kids and rebels, and probably well within the city's wireless footprint at that. I shunted the file into local memory and jacked out of the public JiP; the first clean punch-out after dumpshock is always a ropey experience. In that blurred moment of being imbetween the digital and the meat, little flashbacks, like jagged shards of memory, tumbling toward you. The creeping blackness. Her blank, digital face rolling up to meet me across the closing ether. The raised arm. Static.

I nearly fell straight backwards as the cybercafe pounded back into being, had to catch myself, my feet heavy and unresponsive. Clipped a guy as I walked out, who turned and stared in that dazed, steet-kid way at the ripple of empty air sliding through the doors.

Something comforting about the heavy thud of my apartment door closing behind me. I guess I'm not as slick I used to be. I thought the hack was flawless. Existing credentials used from a public terminal. I didn't pay, so no credit trail. I shrug off Jarvis' ridiculous jacket and lay down on the bed, a faint lump where he'd fixed in the stolen Japanese mediplant. I feel it pulsing gently, above comfort but below pain. Feel the flesh giving, then contracting. Maybe it was process of elimination. No-one else got dump-shock so bad they were puking and jabbering all over the JiP room. Then again, no-one else touched her. And no-one much seemed to care about the visions, the very real sensations. The experience. Not like other dump-shock. Not just stars and voices and headaches. Something much more. I feel myself drifting back there, my eyelids fitfully dropping over the world and soon there is nothing but the throbbing of the mediplant and the cool blue neon glow of the city.


Floating.
Water everywhere.
But
I can breathe.

Something's running across the back of my mind.
It's not her, it's...
The sound of rotors.
Bright, bright water. Moon over the lake.
Rotors. Cutting the air.

I'm already running for the door as the first shots punch out the windows. No warning means they're not cops. Over the banister and I'm plummeting twenty floors down, just one quick thought and my implants are all alive. On the ground floor I dig a crater four feet deep in the already cracked and stained tile floor, the impact of my invisible body starling the guy from down the hall so bad he drops his bags of liquor and porn. The mediplant thrums happily as it masks the wrenching pain that should be tearing across my abdomin.

On the street and I'm met by another hail of bullets. Dust and smoke erupt from the wall of the apartment complex as a car alarm laments the loss of its windscreen. The wind shifts unnaturally as the chopper drifts overhead; its single, red eye, fixed and glowing, staring right at me. I sprint through alleys and backstreets, sliding under parked cars and darting through abandoned buildings. Still that eerie unease in the air, shot through with the sound of rotors and gunfire. Behind me, a car spontaneously explodes, followed in hurried steps by the pavement and a pair of streetlamps. I break off toward a subway station and hope the sudden change of direction is a surprise to the pilot. I take the first set of steps in a single leap as the chopper overshoots, rolling on its side as it scrambles to cancel its momentum. I breeze into the carriage as the doors close, my legs throbbing but not tired, the warm pulse of the augmentations seeming to sooth the muscles. I slump into an empty seat and plan my next move. If they're on me, chances are they're on her too, where-ever she is. If she's in the slums, if she stays there, she should be OK. I doubt they want her as bad as they want me, although an attack chopper is new for arbitrating internal disciplinaries. 

Then it hits me. It's not an internal matter anymore. I'm out. They probably think she turned me. They're probably right.

I am not long for the world. I take in the carriage. Almost empty, the only other riders spaced out across the seats and doing their best to pretend they can't see each other. They don't have to pretend with me. I am a ghost now, unseen and the world around me feels distant and disconnected. Transient. Like leaving home for the first and last time. If I am to rest in peace, there is only one thing I have left to do.

I've seen her home before; a typical slum shanty in a typical slum town. An ineligant construction of corrigated metal and sheets of wood, plastic tarps and other salvage leaning against the wall of a transit yard. Unseen by all but the sharpest eyes, a shimmer, like water in the breeze of the cold night air, I perch and watch her transform and transmutate herself. She runs the grubby cable from the decrepit deck to just behind her ear, fumbles blindly for the switch. And then she connects to the global network, the other unseen, and she is away. Deep in flight, her body cross-legged and motionless in its tin shrine. her fingers twitch reflexively, but she doesn't even touch the keys. For all her antiquated means, she is as pure and competant in her methods as me or anyone I worked or trained with.

I watch her for a long time. A hidden jewel in the corrogated rough, un-noticed by the other denizens of the ass-end of the city. They scratch around, yell, run, fight, feed and fuck. Their territory identified by decay and co-option, a structured unruliness, overlapping, pounding music and cracked voices shouting. Outpaced and forgotten by the glittering metropolis that looms over their territory, their claim is to the purest and basest of humanity. Many are unaugmented, though most possess at least a simple datasocket. And through this one concession to the machine, they challenge us. Brought up with no escape but drugs and cyberspace, the city's rejection of their plight has created a virtual race of master hackers. Proficient and highly motivated, and globally very likely outnumbering the combined forces of the corporations. Watching her, distantly drifting through the ether, presumably smashing through layers of ICE to stop the electronic heart of some vast conglomerate, I wonder if corporate society has, in its unhalting drive for global dominance, sown the seeds of its own destruction.

She jolts slightly as she jacks out, digital inertia spilling over into the real. She doesn't even pause to shake it off, just bundles up the cable and the deck, slides them into a patched and worn backpack, and heads out into the chaos of the slum.

I keep my distance as best I can. I'm trying to move slow so transparent shroud from the stealth implant doesn't ripple too much. Don't want to give myself away in this neighborhood. She takes us out to the edge of the city, beyond even the slum. Just wasteland, storage and crumbling, abandoned lots. True no-man's land, home to the ultimate misfortunates: abandoned by the city and rejected by the underground. Urban purgatory. Three street kids, not much older than her, slide out of a doorway in front of me. They whistle and cat call, but she doesn't seem to hear. Just keeps on walking. They walk too. Calling out to her in the bastard language of the streets, slurred through the dialect of the bottom of town. I recognise enough to know that they are locals.

They quicken their pace, breezing past me to walk on either side of her. Still she seems oblivious, staring straight ahead, unfliching, without the slightest sway in her step. One of the boys reaches out, runs his fingers down her hair and across her shoulders. Before he can reach her arm, she flicks out her fist, catches him square in the centre of his face. He doesn't even cry out, just staggers back, stunned. His friends pause for a moment, slackjawed and staring at him. Then the face comes up. Crude innuendo replaced by pure aggression. The moment they land their first footfalls into their run, she's darting away, and I'm running too, unsure of whether to reveal myself and save her or not.

We sprint in a loud, scattered formation across a vacant lot of dust and stones, peppered with dead, wiry plants. I almost miss her bolting into a decrepit warehouse, but the boys don't. I follow them. Sprinting through the wide, echoing corridors, sucking down the thick, chalky air, my fists clenching and unclenching in anticipation of the grasp of their throats. Somewhere up ahead I hear a loud clattering sound and skitter round a corner just in time to see a huge, rusted bulkhead door slam down between me and the street kids. A bent iron bar that clearly once held the door rocks back and forth on it's crooked axis. I wedge my fingers under the door and try to lift, but it's too heavy and I feel the mediplant spasming as it fails to keep a distinct twinge of pain from shooting across my flank. I search frantically for another way around, still hearing the boys' booming threats and slurrs echoing from beyond the bulkhead. A cluster of mice skitter past me, spooked out from under a pile of rotting cardboard, and scrabble up the wall and slip between the tarnished grill of an air vent.

I kick through the grill and slide into the vent in one motion, thundering through the vent on my feet, knees and hands. The Soundwave Triangulator helps to pick her and her pursuers out from the background noise, the visual overlay pins them with a cluster of spinning yellow triangles. They've stopped moving.

I drop from the ceiling, the vent cover sounding a metallic thunderclap. In 5 seconds I am done. I don't miss. Three to the heart, two in the head, three times over. The bullet casings are still rolling around the floor when the bodies crumple. I crouch invisible, surveying my work, but she sees me anyway. Hot breath on my cheek, cold steel to my temple.

""Who are you?"" I've never heard her talk before. Her voice is not what I expected, yet it fits her so well; flat, indifferent. No feeling yet still alive. I have no idea what to say. As a courtesy, I reveal myself.

""Why are you following me?"" The gun barrel shifts a little, her fingers working into a better grip on the handle.

""I'm looking after you."" There is a long silence, and then the pistol is gone. I slowly stand and turn to face her, but she is already walking toward the door. Caught in the exhileration of meeting her, I let her go. In the back of my mind, images throbbing of the JiP, covered in a web of blackness. The pain, the anger, and something inexpressible. A feeling. It rushes up in me, drags me to my feet and drives me through the door.

She doesn't seem to notice me as I enter. A large section of floor panelling, dented and corroded, is propped against the wall. In the cavity is a mass of cables and pipes. She is kneeling next to it, rummaging through the dense weave.

""Hey."" She doesn't look up, instead dredging up a thick tube of black rubber. She uses her hands to tear and scratch away the sheath and I suddenly recognise the company mainline, a fat, glowing bundle of optical fibers that form the high-speed backbone of the wider corporate network, and our primary connection to the Net.

""What are you doing with that?"" It was a pointless question. What she was doing was squeezing a thick gel out of a tube onto the optical line, and using it to splice another line from her deck into the backbone.

""What the hell is all this about. Do you know who I am?""

Suddenly, I'm pointing my gun at her. I'm trembling and my voice wavers as I shout:

""Hey! I'm fucking talking to you!"" No response, she just calmly plugs the other end of the line into the back of her deck.

""Get away from there! What are you doing?! Who... wha..."" My breath falters and I feel myself slowly lowering the pistol as she connects the dirty uHID cable. Then she pauses, fixes me with a totally impassive expression, and slots another cable into the secondary uHID. I stare at it, hanging there off the edge of the desk, barely registering her jacking in. Then I take it watch myself take it in my hand, and slot the head into the socket at the base of my skull.

I was expecting her to be racing away, down the optical line in a bundle of photons, slicing her way through whatever security we'd thrown up since her last incursion. Instead, she's still in the staging area on her deck. She lifts her hand to show me something. Just a flat, featureless grey rectangle, framed in neon blue. Satisfied that I've seen it, she suddenly plunges into into the floor. The latices of colour demarking the borders of the deck pulse as if recoiling in pain, and then a slick, grey puddle steadily seeps from the object. It pools around her feet, and starts to wind up her legs, branching out in patterned spirals and jagged forks. Her head falls back as she begins to vibrate, her form becoming a blur of creeping grey. Bewilderment strips all those years of training and decking away. I should throw myself to the ceiling, or down into the optical flow, or punch out. I forget myself and take a step back, tranfixed by her transformation.

Without warning, she reaches across the deckspace and grabs me, pulling me into the grey. My hearts pounds in my chest as I realise I've felt this cold, prickling sensation before. I try to shake it off, tell the meat to reach up and yank out the cable from the base of my neck, but my arms don't respond. The slick creeps up into my nose and I can't breathe, it fills my ears with a roaring silence. It spills into my eyes and my face turns into ice.

I'm trying to remember something. Like deja vu, but the memory never fits. I'm somewhere unfamiliar, but there's something I recognise pulsing underneath it all. I can feel her here. Feel her moving through me, not blank anymore. Everything she is hangs like pearls on a string. Pain, happiness, potential, actuality, fears, memories, held and steered together by her as she drifts in and out of my understanding. I can half envision her, her face shifting from glee to horror, to boredom, to confusion, to sleep, within a halo of datanodes. I reach for one and it gives easily, spilling forth a dense stream of data. It washes over me, but doesn't overwealm. I drift in it, picking out details as they come to me. Her name. State care. Her first deck. The attack on our server. The sun, swollen and blazing, punched through a sheet of pure blue, framed by brown and red clouds. The shape of a man, floating in a beaker of dark water. The smell of decaying flesh. The dead child in my doorway. The brief, dim sense of despair and regret that we have scoured an entire continent of natural life. She giggles. My memories. Her construct. Then I laugh as well. We laugh in unison forever. Just one of us, everything all together, understood. A blissful eternity. Formless and dead, we swirl through peceptions and living potential. We lap at the shore, then cast like the wind over an impossibly lush, grassy hilside. We become a star in the night sky. We know ourselves from each other, the contrast highlighting the contradictions and commonalities. Common ground between conflicting poles, our flicking light of illumination.

Then I realise there is someone else. I recognise it from my memories in her. The blank thing. It hovers around us, flat and malicious. Curious and benevolent. She stirrs. A dish. Arecibo observatory. The internal network. Not what we were looking for. Nor Us, but it'll do. A vessel to carry the message. The first handshake. It leans in close, a huge grey tidal wave, a perfect curve. 

It feels like dumpshock, but harder and warmer. More. And less. I'm dazed, that familiar feeling of being behind glass, trapped somewhere just askew from everything else. Half here, half there. But now the lucidity is overwhealming. I open my eyes and the world seems to rush in, every single detail. The pattern of rust on the doorframe, the shapes formed by the blackness between the hanging webs of lights. I feel my body humming like a pure machine, the streams of electrons racing through the building's electrics, and then the central secret slowly unfolds. I hear the slow hiss of traffic far away, and feel the city's quiet pulse. The flow of bodies through warm, moist streets. The flicker of neon, and the ceaseless firing of the information synapse. Terror and misery, hunger and hope, drugged indifference, a fleeting glimpse of the outline of a bigger picture. As I press my hands against the damp floor, I feel it connect. The city to its neighbor, the people like millions of tiny, switching nodes, reaching out through the languid sprawls. A flash of faces and lives, ideas. The planet slumbers, some incredible god on the brink of awakening. Embrionic and all-consuming, just waiting for one final breath. Unity. A curtain of a thousand petals falling.

The first bullet tears through her chest before the grenade even explodes. The electromagnetic pulse tears her out of cyberspace and into the agony of meat. If she cries out, I don't hear her. My ears speak in the garbled tongue of corrupt data. The last I see of her she is calmly putting a handful of bullets through a shocktrooper's faceplate. Through a headsplit haze of purple noise, I watch another grenade land. This one is just for the flesh. It opens its mouth with fire for teeth and smoke for a tongue and mutters:

""Boom.""

Black rain is falling from the sky and I'm staring face-down at the floor. Pure white being eaten up by the darkening puddle. Drip drip drip. I feel something tighten around my legs, and I'm dragged away, leaving behind me a sky-blue trail. I hear voices. Unmistakably: Shall we vat him? and in reply: Nah, he'll be alright, throw him in the trunk.

""That's quite enough, Mr Wallace, thank you.""

Tubes down my throat and something sticking in the side of my head. Glass, water and emptiness. I can't feel my chest. A solitary figure emerges from the darkness, rotund and full of official bearing. A familiar voice.

""Your testemony has been most valuable, and uniquely florid. Rest assured that it will hold pride of place in the archives. Sergent."" He motions to a hand on an unseen switch and I know exactly what is about to happen. It hardly matters anymore. In the face of what I have seen in her. What she has seen. They cannot st"

"event","Randomly celebrate your existence in a consciousness time-line where the bomb did not drop with this double-whammy of Cold-War Curiosity!

First, thrill to the stereo sounds and glorious Technicolor sights of 1984 BBC documentary ""Threads"", streaming NOW down the neon-pathways of the Global Superinformation Webwork at http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-2023790698427111488&hl=en-GB
This groundbreaking docu-drama unflinchingly portrays the consequences of a nuclear-strike on Our Great Nation by those dastardly Communist Swine of Soviet Russia. Laugh at the quaint ways of our forebears in the 1980's: their bulky television receivers, repulsive automobiles, primitive consumer electronics and hilarious accents! Feel your mind and heart judder with pathos as you lock eyes with terrified civilians observing a nuclear airburst above Sheffield! Gorge your animalist Schadenfreude at graphic demonstrations of the effects of radiation poisoning and social and economic collapse in the aftermath of the blasts! If you are so inclined, you may well feel your corporeal form swell with vindication and self-righteousness as before your very eyes the nightmare consequence of the service of nuclear weapons plays out, as you have so often warned. Finally, weep genuine tears of thanks from your hollow, sunken eyes that, by the triumphant victory of free-market capitalism, we have survived!

Next, having been forced to sit helplessly and watch the utter annihilation of everything you know by the relentless and uncaring gears of international politics, you no doubt hunger to claw back some fragile sense of security and control. Now, with the latest release from Introversion Software, you can do just that!

DEFCON is a strategy video-game that turns your home computation system into an altar of impassionate nuclear destruction. BUILD your defences, DEPLOY your navies, and when the time comes, LAUNCH volleys of Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles at the cities of your hated enemies! Failure to properly distribute your nuclear silos, airfields and naval forces will spell unavoidable devastation for your peoples, as you are by now well-equipped to envision. Play online against your peers and betters, or huddled alone against the cold, unflinching intelligence of your machine. Visit http://www.everybody-dies.com/ for a free playable demo, and also details on how to spend a paltry ten English pounds to unlock the full-game and all the potential for megaton-japery that so entails. If interest in this game is sufficient, cooler intellects may well be inspired to set up a departmental ladder. Perhaps then we shall finally see who within this school possess the psychopathic determination to see their state survive that will surely serve them well, post-graduate, in any number of politically-related fields.

For emphasis, rather than as the result of weak-minded error, I reiterate that we are indeed most fortunate to have escaped nuclear annihilation, and it is the duty of any right-minded man (or woman, should any have the unnatural fortitude) to articulate his thankfulness. How better, then, to do so, than to immerse oneself into imaginings of what horrors might have been? Do not delay; Experience the embrace of palpable relief to-day!"

And now, Steve Irwin as well.

I'm not a fan of the Internet generation's zeal to make public and overwrought displays of mourning for celebrities and public figures. There was something oddly disingenious about the waves of digital salutes to Dimebag Darrell; the MSN sign-in names punctuated by wilted flowers and broken heart icons, the lengthy, rambling threads on forums across the net with scores of posts which seemed bent on achieving the ultimate level of devestation at the loss of a guitar-playing legend, the oneupmanship no less appauling for it's unintentional nature, stemming from somewhere deep in the basic culture of the Internet.

At the time I was a little more fierce in my criticism of the mourning-fetish movement, but today, maybe, I understand it a little better. Steve Irwin is dead.

But you probably knew that already. Not exactly Chuck Norris, The Crocodile Hunter was something of an internet icon in his own right, his borderline gonzo take on tired Discovery Channel fodder nature documentaries won him to viewership of the core cyberspace demographic, 14-30 year-old geek-types, hooked on the strange and subversive. He was the real life Crocodile Dundee, the arcetypal half-crazed, slightly uncomfortably enthusiastic outdoors man that represents a distict image of Australia. It was always hard to tell if he was actually crazy, or if the frenetic, manic joy he seemed to take in provocing nature's most deadly creations was some carefully honed schtick, designed to help him hook his audience and bring them into his world of lethal spiders, vicious, brightly coloured snakes, and the ubiquitous crocodiles. The bizzare motion picture did little to dispell the confusion, but plenty to cement Irwin's place as a pop-icon, distilling his nature show down to it's core ingredients: Irwin's gleaming-eyed, slightly niave bushwhacking persona, and a well delivered dose of education about the inhabitants of the outback.

I'm finding it hard to take in the fact that he's dead. I'm not laying claim to the sort of numb denial, the shock that his friends and family are no doubt feeling right now; I'm not all broken up over his death, but oddly I am deeply saddened by it. Schtick or no, Irwin's obvious passion for his work and for sharing that passion with other was as inspiring as it was entertainingly strange to behold. As much as we tuned into his show to laugh at this crazed Aussie, leaping about the scrubland, becoming breathlessly, almost sexually excited about various obscure species and sub-species of lizards, there was a recognition that we were watching a true entertainer and educator at work, in the vien of all those favourite teachers and adults when you're a kid, so unconcerned with being cool and yet so good-natured and passionate that they kind of wound up being cool anyway. That alone would make his death tragic to those who were even casually aware of him, but there's something more. More than anything else, I think, he possessed a certain, distinctively Australian brand of wrecklessness, a crazed, grinning and thoroughly good natured lack of concern for his own well-being which shrowded him in a sort of pall of invincibility. Even as we laughed at the insanity of Irwin deliberatly pissing off all sorts of nature-built death machines, the underlying message was that if anyone could handle a funnel-web spider, or ram an injection into the ass of a crocodile and live to tell the tale, it was Steve Irwin. His death, by one of those lethal creatures, no less, shatters that image of indestructability, making it so universally tragic and unbelievable, in the same vein as Christopher Reeve's paralysis, but more so. A real-life Superman of the outback, a bona-fide hero, has passed.

"event","Have you ever heard the expression ""Smile, and the whole world smiles with you""?

That's because all is one, baby. Maybe it's just the psilocybin talking, but the psilocybin says all this is just a dream in the mind of god. In your mind, in my mind. Cause all is one. Take away everything we are physically and hot damn, what do you have left? Only conciousness. The same spark in all of us.

Oh yes, all is one. And that one is you, and me. And I am a dreamer.

It's hard to pluck out the cause from the effect. Have the last few months been unbearable, shitstorming hell because of a mixture of drug abuse, failed relationships, botched plans and poisonous work environments? Or is the power of expectation and mood so much that my negative outlook has swung things against me?

Was today so sweet because I was happy, or is it really as simple as it seems and I'm just riding the waves of some unfathomable tide of fortune?

Sometimes it's just so simple.

Syzygy.

Synchrony.

Synergy.

My sign must be in the ascendent. I'm usually totally useless in the mornings. It's hard enough to stay on the damn board without falling off. Manuals are tricky. Ollies are out of the question. This morning punctuality was crucial. I could not miss my train. Absolutely not. I had to be in the office on time, on this, the day of My First Official Disciplinary. I was in a rush, running on sunshine and two sides of toast. I was carving flatland, the board melting to my feet as swayed from my hips, down through my knees to my ankles. The board growling and sliding in perfect response. Total unity.

Past the pub and I drop the curb and rattle across the rough tarmac flood of the carpark. I kick twice, hard and smooth into the climb out on to the pavement, the tactiles at the crossing barely slowing me as I nose into the First Hill.

The manual isn't really a choice. It's an instinctive reaction at this speed and heading. The only conscious process is choosing when. I skitter past the first parked car and without really thinking I push the board out with my back foot. My arms arch in the air and my body locks. For a long downhill moment, I am caught in total equilibrium; a complex tree of balances and posture, freewheeling down a tarmac footpath. Then the speed bleeds away, the equilibrium is thrown and I jerk back and forth, trying to maintain my balance. I feel the tail scrape and bring the front wheels down gently.

As I approach the curb I kick in a bit more speed, just enough, I reckon, to carry me through the acid drop. But already I'm feeling it. That strange, calm alertness. Connectivity. Response. I Can Do Incredible Things Today.

The drop is clean, but the road is badly surfaced with huge jagged stones jutting out of the smooth sea of tarmac like broken teeth. After the landing, the board trys to slide away, the wheels bouncing off the angular stones. My speed is falling fast and even in the two meters to the far curb I'm already barely rolling. But I'm close enough, and for once I feel confident. A slight bend of the knees. I jump, forget the front foot for now, pop. A half-concious flash of instinctive, minute movements. And I'm back on the pavement, careening wildly and barely in control. I have to slip a foot off to steady myself, but I'm still rolling.

I just landed my first ollie of the day.

Work is a numb bore, a stale buzz of computers and background chatter, halogen lamps. The disciplinary is itself late, completely defanged, harmless. All is well. At lunch time I think to myself ""Fuck the rules."" I ride to the sandwhich shop across town, only half watching for Street Wardens. To my surprise, I throw the board down and on that little inertia alone I manage to carry a manual in perfect balance several meters along a pavement into the gardens. At this point, I have no concept that I'm going to write this article, despite the deep connections between this place and my last article.

The end of the day takes forever, but springs into view like waking up in the morning. The car park is empty and cool. 

I skate.

More smooth ollies. They happen with minimum imput from me, still a little sketchy on the landings, but with decent air. I'm satisfied, because usually it takes me a lot of time to warm up enough to even do a half-assed rocket pop. I cruise toward the station. Work was dull and protracted, and I am an intelligent man. If I was a parrot, I'd be eating my own feathers. But I'm not tired. I've got designs on tearing up a few of my favourite spots before chilling out for the evening, then maybe heading out to a new spot I've found, crank out some stairsets after dark. That strange and welcome feeling of having Timing is all over me, like damp electricity. It's an idea waiting to be expressed. 

I am going to skate.

The train has literally just cleared the end of the platform when Greg tells me he's in a bar with some lady friends. He sounds like he needs some help. I ride the train for two stations until it finally stops, and head back in. There's no hesitation as I weight the options. I'm in a bar mood. The night is warm and content, shot through with a muted excitment. This is a good time to be underground with friends.

The bar is host to loud live bands, most of whom aren't as old as me. The first guys sound like early Blink, the next like Bad Religion and give out free CDs. Despite the offensively bad sound system and frantic music, it feels good to be there. Most of the clientelle are the same age or younger than the bands, and it takes me back to the times when people still knew how to have fun. I miss being 17. But it's chilled and good, and I'm happy I came. It feels like the most right place to be, and as the music blasts over me I realise I have to nod to my predecessor, Hunter Thompson, for my heart is indeed filled with joy, and wonder if tonight I might just skate all night long. I am smoldering with a queer lust for the laws of physics. Some part of my subconcious is pricking at me with the notion of jerking out a manual across a footpath, ollieing a 3, or just dicking around my new spot. This is the death of sorrow.

On the way home, we stop to drop off Lauren and get some pizza. Then me and Greg wander to the next bus stop, singing System Of A Down, Cake and Rammstein. Somewhere in the chorus to Violent Pornography I realise shit, these are good times. I'm not in a miserable cunt of a mood anymore. Fantastic.

The new spot is too good to be true, and shall only be refered to in enigmatic terms, lest it be invaded, or, worse, I be found out and barred from entering. It seems virgin. No chips on the curb blocks, no wax stains, no cracked slabs. And oh, the smoothness of the tarmac.

I fluff an ollie over a speed bump, but recover with a satisfying manual. I take a few laps to practice my ollie. They start out passable, but then as I casually prod myself into using my arms more and lifting my legs higher I feel myself holding more air, and flying smoother. Almost by accident I nailed on curb on my first try. A nice ollie, smooth landing and I even manage a smooth drop off the other side. I try to ollie on to the far pavement, but overthink gets in the way. I kick the board across the grass.

The night is warm, but the air is chilled. Perfect skating weather. I've been skating for a while, and there's no sign of anyone coming to bother me. I've just landed a few rather high ollies. Life is very good. The world is smiling with me. And here's the clincher. The curb's fast approaching. I size up the distance and look at my board. Squat. As I jump, I take in my rough landing location. I bring my front foot up and the board catches perfectly. Watching the nose, I see my back foot out of the corner of my eye, tucking itself up nicely out of the way. My front foot is flat now, and slowly pushing forward to level the board out. I can still feel the board trying to climb higher. Somewhere near the back of my neck, I already know this is going to be a keeper.

And then there's a moment where nothing happens. The board is level and we're falling. Waiting.

Contact, all four wheels at once. I've dropped the otherside by the time I realise that rather than simply popping over the curb and slamming the board onto the pavement, I actually ollied well clear of the pavement, and then landed over it. A totally clean, textbook ollie.

Fuck yes.

And then, turning to leave, I do the exact same onto the footpath out onto the main drag.

So now I'm reflective. Why can I do today, almost without thought, what I couldn't do yesterday, or the day before? Why am I so relaxed today? What has changed? If I think positively, will I only have good luck? Or are there other forces at work here?

None of it matters to me, though. Not so much as the realisation that the time is now. Regardless of the how or why, today was a clear cut Good Day in the traditions of the Good Days of yore. A year ago, hell, even yesterday I couldn't imagine myself skating like I did tonight. Even a few days ago, I couldn't concieve of myself feeling this happy again. But here I am, three inches above the ground, with a huge fucking grin on my face."

"event","Y'know, it's been bugging me a bit that the real meaty bits of this developing twisted romance between me and Charlotte is lost forever, completely undocumented by me. Not least because she says she's been looking for this journal to try to find all the things I've written about her, and I feel a bit dumb for not having written a whole lot about her. I guess it'd have been nice to be able to one day show her some entry along the lines of ""Met a cool new waitress at the casino tonight. She's called Charlotte and she's scary as fuck. She's so confident and no-nonsense, but without being some kind of cold bitch. And she has the most adorable laugh and smile. Too bad I'm past chasing after women!"" Also, I guess it'd be useful to help fathom exactly what's going on to record these little emotional milestones. Sort of chart how I'm feeling from week to week, maybe see a bigger picture. Who knows, I've gone off on a nice little bullshit-tangent, and I have to admit, a good part of my motivation to write this is because my last post was shit-o.

Where am I going with this? Oh, right, yeah. I've decided, for posterity and to guard against catastrophic nmemonic failure, and also to help me just figure out what's happening inside my head, I'm going to write down everything I'm thinking and feeling about Charlotte. So here goes.

She's awesome. It's like, everyone is an individual on some level. You never find two people who are totally the same person. Aside from maybe twins, but let's not get to deep here. So many people out there are kinda dull, or not like... memorable. Seems like most of the girls I meet remind me of someone else, or are sort of stamped out copies of a generic model: emo girl, office chick, one of the lads, etc. The minutae varies, but ultimately it feels like when I look in the faces of most of these people, I just see usually really lovely people who just... I dunno, they don't really capture my imagination. I think that's why I don't have many friends. I just don't get too excited by a lot of people. I know I sound like I'm getting down on everyone, like some kind of snobby elitist, but I try to live and let live, y'know? These people probably think I'm a total freak who needs to get his shit together, and they probably wouldn't be wrong. But Charlotte is different. So fucking different. The minutae and the... maxutae, it all just swings together, y'know? The way she talks about stuff, like how she has this chip on her shoulder still from being picked on when she was little, or the way the winter hits her really hard... these hang ups and insecurities that you probably wouldn't pick up on a first pass but that kind of leak out from time to time from behind her smile and in her eyes... I can totally relate to them. I mean, yeah, a lot of people have SAD, a lot of people got picked on, but it's the way these things affect her and how she handles them... reminds me of me, but just different enough to not be... I dunno, an ego trip. Feels kinda like we're on this wierd shared frequency. She's into all this occulty stuff, with faeries and vampires and the more freaky end of the Biblic lore. It totally rocks, cause I've always wanted to get into that sort of stuff, but I've never been arsed enough to make a proper start. And then one night I'm flicking through her art work, and she's into Giger and sort of cybergothic stuff as well. Cyberpunk... hell, just about cyber anything is so totally my bag. Just another freaky synchronisity that makes me wonder exactly what the odds are of finding a girl who just hits all the right notes.

She plays rough too. When we playfight, she punches pretty hard, but it's kinda cool. Most girls I wouldn't really dig it that much, but with her... it's kinda OK. Fuck knows why. It kinda hurts! But I think it's the timing. And the way she grins with this glint in her eye when she does it. It's kinda sexy and playful at once. Kinda like her, actually. She's tough and resillient, I know she could look after herself. But at the same time she's got this vunerability, this sort of awkward insecurity that feels like how I feel, and it keeps her from being like... mondo hard. A lot of girls who are tough and independant are difficult to get close to, or to feel close to, cause you know they could just cut you loose whenever it suited them, that you'd never really matter to them. Conversley, a lot of shy girls are really clingy and kinda scary and high maintainence which makes getting close them a sort of Icarus schtick. Bye bye wings. Charlotte's got this balance so she wouldn't ever be like... well, like Nat, but she's still emotionally accessable. I feel like I could just lay next to her and hold her and feel... close? Like she'd let me in as deep as I wanted to go, and as much as she wanted. Or something. So we could like... know each other really intimately, and be able to rely on each other, but without it being really fucking freaky. Somewhat like this creepy little paragraph here. let's move on, shall we, cause I'm starting to sound like I'm obsessed.

That's something that's been working on my mind too. What if I'm just obsessed with her? Recently, the more I sort of flirt with her, and she says ""no"", cause of her boyfriend... the more she warns me not to get my hopes up about me and her, the more it sounds like she really means that she's already decided that it's not going to happen. And it's making it hard to keep hanging in there like everything's gonna pan out OK. Kinda got me thinking the other night that I'm into darkly familiar territory here. I'm about to become a third wheel in someone else's relationship. I'm gonna be the obviously smitten guy, lurking in the background, waiting for his chance. Just like with Hannah. And Emma. And Stella, to an extent. Granted, out of those three, only Stella ever said she liked me, and even then it was some wierd passing fancy of her's, but how much now do I get down on them for the time I feel like I wasted on them? Everytime, I told myself, this is the big one, this has gotta pan out, I gotta just keep fighting here. Then I quit doing that cause it was just all a big waste of time. And now here's this girl who I feel so strongly for, and in a majorly different way than to anyone before, and she says she feels the same for me, but she's got all this unfinished business with her boyfriend. And actual feelings for him. Should I fight for this one as well? Or should I just learn from the past already and find some way of salvaging some kind of workable friendship out of this, lest I get all bitter and lose her totally?

It's a tough call. She makes me feel so... young and hopeful and... just really fucking right with the world, y'know? And when I'm with her, I never wanna stop touching her or talking to her or looking at her. I can't take my eyes off her, to paraphrase Damien Rice. I really should download that song... I feel like, were it not for the complicating factors of us not being together, I could be totally open with her. Shit, y'know what it is? I actually feel like she cares about me. Like, I know a lot of people care, and I appreciate it. But to know something and to feel something are totally different things. Especially here. And the kicker is that I care too. I hope she can feel that. I hope she gets that I do care, even though I'm constantly forgetting stuff she tells me, or talking incessantly, and putting her in a really difficult situation.

What scares me is that since she started warning me off and hinting that she's gotta stick with Alistair, I've been, like I say, having these flashbacks to all these other situations, and I'm starting to get suspicious of her. I'm scared she's maybe using me, not necessarily conciously, just like everyone else seems to have done. Cause I'm reliable and safe and I'll always be there, she can go right ahead and choose Alistair cause he won't stick around. This is the only way she gets us both, and it winds up with me not being able to wake up next to her, or hold her, or just... be able to do all those boyfriend type things I just instinctively wanna do, without feeling kinda guilty. I keep thinking like maybe I should shake things up a bit, go cold on her and try to scare her into realizing that I'm maybe not just some reliable back-up guy. But I don't want to hurt her, especially not on purpose and even more so just, y'know, for my own sake. That'd make me a total asshole, and it'd be betraying whatever trust she has in me. She cried one night, at the casino, as she was telling me about a dream she had where she started getting all tactile with me in front of Alistair, who started crying. I know I didn't make her cry directly, and that basically we all just ran headlong into the main nerve of the whole situation, but I still felt like total scum. In fact, when I think about how this situation has gotten her down and yanked her about, I kinda want to just take myself out of the running, just to make things easier on her. And I would do if it wasn't for the fact that the way she makes me feel, the way things are between us, hell, just her... is so beautiful, so powerful, so different and important feeling that it fucking crushes me to think of letting it go.

On some level, it feels like the right thing to do. Just... find some way of getting over her, let it all go, try and find some other girl, stick with Charlotte as a close friend and hope for the best. But I don't know if that's just the self-destructive streak in me or my actual concience or moral compass. So hard to tell these days. Stupid drugs. But on another level, it looks like she feels what I'm feeling, and maybe it's the right thing to do to fight to preserve that. But then, she says she used to feel this way for Alistair. So I'm completely lost and confused and scared and frustrated. I knwo it's my own fault for letting myself get sucked deeper and deeper into this, even after I met her boyfriend, but it still feels kinda like this amazing person wandered right into the core of my life, and is now being pulled away again. Or maybe I didn't really have a choice. Maybe once these things start, you can't really stop them at all. I wish I could talk to her about it, but it seems like we're always having these really heavy talks, and I know they tend to wind up upsetting her, and they always make me feel hopeless and painfully alone. But at the same time, having to hide all this uncertainty from her is making me start to resent her already. I don't want to fuck this up. I so don't want to fuck this up. I always fuck these things up, but this time it's fucking mutual and it should be great and it just looks like whatever I do, I'm going to corrupt this really pure and beautiful thing between us.

Part of me is just really confused about how she can feel the way she says she does about me, and still go back to Alistair. I mean yeah, OK, so there's the ton of practical issues about money and everything that mean that she can't realistically leave him without fucking up her entire life. And I understand that in anycase, she needs to give him at least one last try to rekindle what they had in the beginning. And she doesn't want to hurt him, just like I don't want to hurt her. But say she does get back with him, and it all works out OK... what happens to me? What happens to her feelings for me? Do they just get watered down until I'm just like a brother to her? Does she lose all interest in me all together? Does she just try to ignore it and bottle it all up? I'll admit, she's given me something I've always really craved... to feel like I'm special to someone in that way that you think about them when you feel down or alone, or when you're going to bed, or just whenever you feel like.... feeling like there's someone out there. And it feels like if she gets back with him that I'm just gonna wind up disappearing back into the backgrounds. That this awesome thing between us is just gonna fade away. It's scratching at me just thinking about it. And it's all so selfish too. I'm getting all hung up on how she feels about ME, where I'M going to fit in. Surely I should just be able to be happy for her? And let's not forget that if she were to choose me, then Alistair would be going through this shit instead.

Feels like I'm out way above my station. She's got this life that I've just dropped into. She's known me for a few months, and already I'm trying to take over from a guy she's known for years. I feel like such a loser when I think of it that way. I don't think she realises sometimes that this whole thing really does cut me up as well. Cause I've always been with the brave smile and positive attitude to keep from getting all needy and desperate sounding, but I think what's actually happened is that it looks like I can take it in my stride, that I like her a lot, but that I don't necessarily feel like I need her. I mean, I know I don't technically need her, that with or without her life will go on. But what a different life it'd be without her. She mentioned the other day that she's never seen me get upset about things, which is what really got me thinking about this. I guess it;s because I don't feel comfortable gettiung upset in front of her, cause I feel like it'd hurt her to see me hurting and just make it all more difficult for her.

God damn... it's all such a piss take. it should all be simple. But it's not and I don't know what to do. Everything in me wants to just be with her, but there's all this additional shit that makes me feel so fucking rotten to even think that way in the first place. Heh, it's almost like a gay romance. All this forbidden fruit, all this self-loathing and guilt and heavy looks. What's bugging me most right now is how desperate I'm starting to feel, and how I feel like a creep around her, and I'm worried about shifting the dynamic of our relationship so I feel this way around her forever. I just want things to be good and happy between us. I guess I could live with her as a real close friend if she was with Alistair still, but it'd be so frustrating having that limit. I mean, as a friend, I can hug her, I can hold her when she's tired or upset or down. I can stroke her hair or maybe get away with holding her hand. But I can';t just let it flow naturally beyond that. I keep smacking my head on this damn invisble wall. I can't kiss her. I can't really stroke her face or put my arm around her or hold her till she falls asleep. I can't do the things to make her feel the way I feel about her. I mean, maybe these things wouldn't make a difference to her anyway, but it'd sure be less exhausting than always trying to rein myself in. More natural.

I'm talking to her on MSN now, and I've kinda lost my train of thought. And I'm rather tired too. Think I've captured everything I'm feeling right now, more or less. And I actually feel like I've wiped this horrible smear of desperation off this little thing between us, just by writing here and getting back in touch with the roots of how I feel for her.

Maybe I should actually write this shit down and show it to her. Now THERE's an idea...

I wanted you to know, I love the way you laugh. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away."

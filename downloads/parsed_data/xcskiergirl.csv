"event","Well, as I've still been sick all this time, and have no better answers either, though it's certainly had some eliminations at least. I am exceedingly tired by my work schedule these days, which causes me to have little life left after work hours at all. I have made a request however to change my schedule, reducing my hours from 40 to 32. I will keep my insurance, and try it out for 30 days to see if it is beneficial. I am hopeful that the partners at my work will be willing to allow me to try it. <br /><br />My pain has been more severe, and today has been a particularly bad day for it. I feel as though there are tears which are constantly allowing viscera to herniate, tearing larger openings in the process. In addition my hypoglycemia symptoms are severe, causing nausea and tremors often. <br /><br />I am writing all this out in an attempt to move on from it. I know these things are true, but it is hard to face them. Recording them in a place that will preserve them indefinitely seems to help me let go of things that are hard to face, because the writing process forces me to face them, and once finished, move forward towards healing. My emotional health is strongly altered from my normal happy, energetic state to a depressed and sometimes angry state, unable to appreciate the good anymore due to being overwhelmed by the bad.<br /><br />I have been practicing mindfulness, and through this work I have been able to gain back some of my old self, through the appreciation of simple joyful moments in my life, savoring them to the last second. I have found the beauty of the world around me to be a constant joy to be mindful of. The swirls of white wispy clouds over the bright blue sky, with a haze in the distance causing the blue to fade to white. Surely the sunset will be enchanting tonight. I will have to remember to watch for it when the moment arrives! Til then I shall enjoy the sky I see now, much like the boy in sola who took pictures of all the different skies he sees. It's such a wonderful story of two people who are nothing but mindful.<br /><br /><div class=""zemanta-pixie""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" alt="""" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=ed1f35a8-d19f-85de-a88f-37249a7d0ea6"" /></div>"

"event","Okay, so I am a huge Doctor Who fan, and we have been watching the newest season with bated breath because it has been really exciting already! <br /><br />Anyhow, the main shocker that has occurred thus far is that Amy was pregnant and there was some implication that the baby may be the doctor's! Well first of all we were like WHAT???!?!?! But, one thing I realized today is that it's silly to assume that there was any sex involved in this. There is already ample examples in the Who universe where babies were made in some pretty crazy ways, and none of them were sex. So, assuming that it isn't from some previously unknown affair that occured last season (can you say lazy writing?) or, as I suspect, there is some sort of explanation that involves some of the crazy stuff that happened last season, or in the first episode. To sum up what plot line I'm talking about here, it's the little girl in the spacesuit who may or may not be Amy's daughter and a time lord (given the little girl who was regenerating at the end of the show who looked like the same girl, and presumably was, from earlier in the episode). <br /><br />Here are my theories:<br /><br />Firstly I thought about the events in the first episode of the season, and I realized: amg she was told by that alien that she had been there much longer than she realized because she kept forgetting everything due to the alien's ability to delete it's presence in the mind! So, it could be that she was pregnant (I'll get to how in a sec) as she told the doctor in the first episode, and she actually had the baby while she was held by the aliens! We don't know how much time passed between when she was taken and when the doctor and everyone got there to rescue her because they used the TARDIS so it could be many months later, possibly long enough to have a baby? <br /><br />So, given that, it's easy to see how they would have had the picture of her holding the baby in that weird room Amy was trapped in just before being abducted. Now, one of the things which was kinda weird about that is that it actually showed up before she was taken. Which means that either the child, or the aliens, have time traveled. Presumably it would be the girl who brought the picture, and who came back in time to get help from the doctor somehow? Maybe that space suit is a time machine too? That would make sense.<br /><br />So, now how would Amy have been impregnated by the Doctor assuming they didn't have sex? I have a couple possible theories for this. I first figure it's good to narrow down when it would have to have happened. She didn't seem to know anything about being pregnant in the first season, and obviously she was in that prison thing for thousands of years, preserved somehow, so that could have put a hold on any pregnancy, so I guess it would be somewhere in the last few episodes, or it actually happened in the first episode of season two.<br /><br />Well, this theory came to be earlier this morning: what if the prison that was made to hold the doctor and which kept Amy alive for thousands of years somehow impregnated her because it clearly had to do some pretty crazy things to revive her, and so I was imagining that the ""spark of life"" was used in some way in this. So, assuming that prison had biological data on the doctor, it would be possible for it to impregnate her coincidentally in it's attempt to save her, by giving her some time lord DNA or something. I haven't totally fleshed that one out yet.<br /><br />Another one that also occurred to me was that there was indeed some preggo hints in season one. The episode where they are attacked by that weird thing that fell down into the TARDIS and caused a ""shadow doctor"" that was the dark side of the doctor appeared who called himself the dream master. He created a dream world where Amy was pregnant. Now, this in combination with the prison made to hold the doctor seems like a baby waiting to happen to me, in true Who plot fashion. <br /><br />Something else that sticks out to me about the aliens is that both Amy and Dr. Song were feeling ""nauseous"" from being around the aliens. But Amy was pregnant so that seemed like why she felt sick to me, so could Dr. Song be pregnant too? Hmm. She did say that everything happens backwards for her, and she seemed sad about it, so maybe she was? She was so sad, and it seemed bittersweet to her, like maybe she wants to be able to share with him that she is pregnant, but she can't since it's ""spoilers"".<br /><br />Well, I'm no Who writer, but my guess is that the doctor's dark side and that object were no coincidence or random event, and were orchestrated by some new enemy we haven't seen yet. The same one who created the box. Who engineered the creation of the time lord child that resulted. Probably also the creator of the space suit. The aliens could be henchmen for this other entity, likely one who has tried to take down the doctor before (I'm thinking cult of scarrow or someone else who normally cooks up crazy long term schemes). How else to get to him than by his heart through a child! In fact, we did see him die, so they have a chance at succeeding in killing him.<br /><br />I have a feeling this won't be all explained and done until the end of this season, but I'm excited to see how it pans out!<br /><br /><div class=""zemanta-pixie""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" alt="""" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=43554e40-c0d5-8dae-aeba-7b31de5cd551"" /></div>"

"event","I got back from the endocrinologist earlier this morning. Once again another disappointing visit to a doctor. Nothing abnormal in my test results, so he can't figure out what's wrong either. <br /><br />I was so hopeful that there would be some news, but I am really down now that I have gotten the information. I don't know what I should do at this point. I keep randomly crying about it and I hate that too. So tired of being a victim. <br /><br />The only thing he did see is that my vitamin D levels are barely above the minimum for normal, so he is having me double my vitamin D to see if that helps me feel better. He didn't have any other suggestions or ideas though. <br /><br />He wants to do a sonogram of my thyroid to make sure there's no nodules, but eve if there are it doesn't mean anything with what is happening he said. <br /><br />I thought it would help to write down how upset I am, because I can't really talk about it right now because I am at work until 5.

"event","So, I had a migraine yesterday. It was the first time in a while that I have had such a severely painful one. I have been attempting to ignore them of late, because I don't want to take medications that don't really work. And I sometimes doubt whether I really get migraines. <br /><br />Well, after careful review of information about migraines listed on several medical websites, I have come to understand that any recurring headaches are likely to be migraines. Sinus headaches are not really a condition, unlike what I was thinking. Essentially I was doubting the cause of the headache because of the fact that I seem to have green stuff that comes out of my nose pretty much daily, though it's dried and seems to be sort of like a dried cap of mucus which forms either at night (since I blow them out in the morning) or throughout the day.&nbsp; Additionally I am often feeling sick, like I am coming down with something, for weeks sometimes, with no actual culminating illness.<br /><br />So I read up on migraines today hoping to maybe get some more info to help me figure out if I really have them or not. I guess people can get migraines that come with all the things I experience, even fever. I sometimes have a very low grade fever, 99 or so, which coincides with headaches and in general feeling like I am coming down with something. Turns out that is something other people also experience when they have a migraine.<br /><br />Since I've been having trouble with digestion and abdominal pain, I have been focusing on trying to solve that, and just sort of living with the migraines. For me often times it's a generalized nausea and queasiness which bothers me most. The problem is that this could be caused by migraines! Christ, I just don't know what it could be for me. <br /><br />Okay, so now I've got to consider so many possibilities. I guess I'll just try to differentiate the symptoms. <br /><br />My counselor suggested that I stay with the pain/nausea/sick feelings I have, to try and figure out if there's any defining characteristics there that may give me some insight into the problem. Similarly to how I picked out the snake as a symbol for my illness. Essentially, she wants me to explore any unconscious clues that might be able to help me.<br /><br />I tried that yesterday at 10am, which is around the time I always feel sick. It's just so hard to do that, because it makes it harder to keep going through my day when I have that kind of discomfort and I am actually paying extra close attention to it, rather than trying to ignore it and let it go. <br /><br />I wish I could figure this out. Only time will tell? I don't know, it hasn't so far. Yesterday, I did a ton of reading online of various things about endocrine problems, and essentially it would appear that I likely have a thyroid issue. I wonder if that kind of problem can be related to migraines too? Hmm.<br /><br />Indeed, it would appear that they do. Interesting. Now maybe if the damn endocrinologist would call me to schedule an appt, then I could maybe get some help for this! Well, I am not too optimistic about it, considering how little help I have received so far from all of the other doctors in this area. <br /><br />I am so fed up with it all. I would say that it's why I am inconsolably angry fairly often lately, but really that seems to be more of a ""every thing that happens makes me so angry"" and it seems to occur regardless of whether I am having a good day or not. It of course always ends up causing it to be a terrible angry day. Any day where I spend a lot of time angry is not a good one, for sure. It seems to go away, and once it's gone the very same things can happen and I don't get angry about them. So, I am not too sure what to think. I guess if I discover that I do have thyroid problems, I can try treating that to see if the ""angry Carly"" times are less severe, or not there at all. <br /><br />Bleh my head hurts again today. Yucktastic. Anyways, that's it for now, I feel at an end with my thoughts on this, as I really have nothing that I can do until after I get that appointment that I need!!!! Grrr.<br /><br /><div class=""zemanta-pixie""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" alt="""" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=708d3ce9-1936-8fe0-98ff-b9d9a3031414"" /></div>"

Seems like everyone says they want it to be about showing someone you care, but then we all end up talking about what we got, lol.<br /><br />Anyhow, I am going to see a movie and eat some yummy dinner. That's pretty much it. Just another day. Well at least that's how I saw it before reading this one blog post that reminded me of someone and something I had forgotten.<br /><br />The blog was from someone who happened to be friends with someone who I was best friends with as a child. He died on Valentines day, several years ago, from a heroin overdose. I really only remember Charlie's bravery. Well that and that you could always count on him. Granted, to remember even than about someone I hadn't seen or heard from since kindergarden is pretty good, but all the same, when someone dies, you kinda feel like you should remember everything. <br /><br />Anyhow, later on he became even more interesting, brave, and wild! He was my ""boyfriend"" in kindergarden, but of course that doesn't really mean anything. He was a ""problem child"" according to the teachers and other parents, but really what he was more than anything is a proud, unafraid person who doesn't want to change himself for anyone. He's gone now, but it would seem that he is still inspiring others, and that's pretty amazing considering. <br /><br />So I just wanted to write something on here for him today, since he died so many years ago on this day, and even though he is just a memory now, it's a good memory and he was a good person. May his memory continue to live on and inspire others :) <br /><br /><div class=""zemanta-pixie""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" alt="""" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=3556a3ab-6b10-800b-bb3c-046dc80d75bc"" /></div>"

"event","Well, occasionally I get these ideas about what happens behind the scenes in our government and all that, like with corporations and powerful people. And I have heard some things said that essentially confirmed that there are corporations, or people who are powerful (aka rich) who are actively trying to keep the average American from being successful, in order to take advantage of them. I have also felt for a long time like there might really be something like that happening, so of course when I hear the hint it feels like it just must be true! I think that sometimes if you pay close enough attention, you can know things that maybe you shouldn't. This might be one of those times, lol.<br /><br />Anyhow, to me this seemed to connect well with my own ideas about what is happening to the human race as a result of our continued distance from and defiance of our natural environment. What if there really are some smart, evolved humans at the top of our society, orchestrating a hostile takeover of everything! It just seems to fit that if like the congressmen who I got this information from are being truthful, that these people are likely to be evolved humans, and possibly due to thier power and resources, they may already KNOW what I am only theorizing about. It could be that they are already working to keep their superiority evolutionally from some other humans secret so that they can carry out their grand schemes. <br /><br />I know it's very ""Pelican Brief"" but really, it could be true! I gotta get going on actually doing something about this. I thought about what I could do to get started, and it seems the first thing is to get the word out there so that other people who agree with me, or who want to help make positive changes to society, will know what I mean and maybe take some action too. People power, yeah!<br /><br />Anyhow, my plan is to write a book and try to get it published. Then probably just a website/forum thinktank.

"event","Alright, so these last few weeks I've been feeling much better, and starting to feel like I can keep up with my life again. There was still the pain and whatnot I am dealing with from the tumors in my back however. This issue was to be resolved favorably through surgery to remove the supposed tumors on 12/31. Well, I got a message yesterday from the doctor's office. <br /><br />Turns out my doctor has the flu. Well, actually I'm not sure that is the truth. That was what I was told as the reason though. Either way, it's impossible for me to get my surgery done before the first of the year now. Due to that, it is now going to cost a ton of money, instead of none. I had paid all of my out of pocket for the year, you see. Now I will have to pay for all of the cost because I'm sure it's going to fall under the deductible. I seriously don't see the point of insurance these days. It doesn't cover the really expensive visits, so honestly I'm not sure that it really makes much of a difference in the end. For example, I learned that most employers ignore medical bills that show up in credit reports, and most of the time the hospital will just write off unpaid bills as uncollectible so you might actually pay more with insurance than without it! Depending on how it ends up. That's the sad truth these days, there's just no benefits to being responsible anymore. You just end up screwed one way or another, so you may as well get screwed from the start, and go into it knowing you will be, maybe it would be less painful that way.<br /><br />I'm kinda scared about how much it's going to cost. Part of me wants to find out so I can be prepared, part of me wants to wait until I actually have to pay it to deal with it. Bleh.<br /><br />And people keep pretty much rubbing it in by talking to me about it. It's like they feel bad for me so they want to tell me how much this whole thing sucks, but I already KNOW it sucks, so it just makes it worse to hear about it over and over. <br /><br />I'm also scared of what these things actually are too. It could be a pretty serious situation if these are cancer or something, and I'm just petrified of that possibility. Well, same as the bill, I am trying not to worry about it until I can actually do something about it. <br /><br />The other thing that I'm wondering about at this point is- is my doctor going to biopsy these to figure out what they are, if she can't tell from just looking? She'd better not just say, ""oh, well they are out so it doesn't matter what they are"" AHHH if she does that I may lose it. Seriously I am sick and tired of being jerked around and I cannot keep trying to forget the bad and remember the good when the bad keeps being piled on and on and on!<br /><br />Okay, so back to what happened. So I get the message and I'm pretty much to tears with the stress of thinking about how screwed I am now that I have to pay for it out of pocket. It makes me feel like I'm sacrificing the rest of my life in order to maybe have a chance at feeling healthy again?<br /><br />FUCK THAT. Fuck it all. I want to destroy something, burn something down, anything to expel my anger and frustration about this. <br /><br />Gah, still didn't get to what happened, it just makes me so mad! Okay, so I call over there, and the woman starts going into possible dates, one is Monday the 3rd and another is the 13th, both of which are not at the end of the week, and will require the maximum amount of time off work. I am so upset at this point that I can't deal with it so I tell her I'll think about it and call back. <br /><br />Then I work up the strength to try and deal with it again. I call again, and explain why I needed it before the 1st of the year, and why I needed it at the end of a week. The doctor just plain can't get it at the end of a week, no explanation why, the woman is too retarded really to explain. Then she says she'll call me back after she works on it a bit and sees what she can do. <br /><br />Okay, so at that I put off feeling upset for the time being, telling myself, it could work out, it might work out. Well, then near the end of the day, no call so I call her again. She tells me there's no way to get in before the first, so I get the available times and then I tell her I'll call back once I've talked with my work about it. <br /><br />Well, I ended up setting it for Monday the 3rd. It's stupid that's it at the start of a week but at this point I shouldn't wait any longer to find out what these are. And I shouldn't wait any later just to end up taking the same number of days off regardless. So, screw it. Or fuck it, if you prefer.<br /><br />Yeah, this is clearly a negative post, but at least I've gotten some stuff off my chest. Well, actually it's more like digging it back out from where I'd forgotten it so really it's probably a bad thing. But since this stuff would never dissapate anyways since I feel such a profound sense of betrayal and also that I have been deeply wronged. There is no one to be mad at, because it's from too many sources. It's really just that this situation has made apparent to me just how awful life can be, and how little I have to look forward to in the rest of my life, assuming that nothing changes. A pretty safe assumption, considering how long it's been this way. As long as human memory, as long as time itself some would argue. And I guess until I die I just have to deal with it. Sadly, now I almost hope I will only live for a short time, so that at least it will be over soon. <br /><br />And I can actually understand why someone would end thier life. I also understand why someone would kill themselves and thier child. Partly to save the child the suffering they would have had to endure by living.<br /><br /><div class=""zemanta-pixie""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" alt="""" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=dab330ff-6f07-8e20-a790-1acc4aca4b57"" /></div>"

"event","So, as is my custom I have been pondering what I see as the flaws and dysfunctions in society. As part of this, obviously I have been trying to come up with solutions to the things that I think are ""wrong"" with society today. For a long time it really seemed hopeless, due to the fact that the problems are derived from the basic premise of life: survival. The reason why that makes something hopeless is that at the very core of survival is the idea that you must choose what is most likely to ensure your survival, and that any being which is less able to meet it's own needs therefore does have a good chance at surviving.<br /><br />Now, this is a two part idea. Partly we are bound by this rule, and partly we are supposedly bound by our own moral code and/or societal structures, for ease of interpretation I will call this ""the right thing to do"". So, there's two parts to the issue with your own survival determining your decisions in any given situation. In society today, it is no longer a certainty that those who are most equipped to succeed are the most successful, and indeed many who are actually incapable of surviving without help from others are deemed successful by others. In addition, there is the fact that what people are taught is the ""right thing to do"" in not to choose what is best for yourself (e.g. survival), as that would be selfish, and therefore wrong. So on the one hand, we are taught that to choose what is best for your own survival is selfish, and on the other, we learn that you don't need to be able to survive on your own in order to be considered successful by others.<br /><br />This double whammy of contradictions are one of the problematic mechanisms of our society. It causes a person too feel conflicted about what choice they should make in any given situation, which gives rise to people who either choose to turn away completely from adopting a moral code in which to live by, people I deem the ""don't care"" group. There are also people who justify their own selfish (e.g. survival) choices but condemn similar choices in others because of their moral code, what I call the ""judgemental"" group. There are also people who react violently to the imbalance inherently caused by this contradiction, choosing destruction of life, and in some the warped perspective becomes all consuming. <br /><br />This type of contradiction leaves even well adjusted individuals with some degree of self hatred or guilt. It's one of the problems in society that is fundamental enough to cause a multitude of related societal problems. Obviously, after pondering this problem I was left with a feeling of hopelessness about there ever really being a way of changing society for the better. I felt like the old standby ""be the change you want to see in the world"" is just something that people invented as a way of letting go of the desire to do big things and instead settling for change in a small way. A cop out, an explanation of how they are doing something without really doing anything different in their lives. Because lets be honest here, who actually goes out and purposely does that? Who thinks of whether it will cause negative impact on the world when you cut someone off in traffic, or bump into them in the store, or even get angry at someone else and direct negative thoughts towards them. It's not easy to go about changing those little things in your life, and also it doesn't really make that big of a difference whether you do good on a small scale like that. There are rare instances where it can make a big difference, but then there are situations where meaning well can actually have the opposite effect of what is intended. Granted, that is something to consider when you think about trying to make big changes in the world, but it shouldn't be used to keep someone from trying to do something good. <br /><br />For me, making society better should take into account the changing structure of our society. Now, what I mean by that is, that I feel that we have an ever widening range of types of people in the world all the time, and that some people are moving in a positive direction, while others are stagnating or even devolving. This means that eventually there may even be more than one human species. <br /><br />Currently people are being divided by ethnicity and social class, and all humans are considered to be basically the same species. How this is theorized to have happened is that there were many variations of humanoids that evolved, and the only of these that ended up making it to the present day (assuming there are no secret humanoids who have remained separate and unknown all this time, which is clearly extremely unlikely) are us. Now, either those other groups all combined into what is now a big conglomeration humanoid, which is my preferred theory, or all the other evolutionary outliers died out because they were less able to survive. Either way, the end result was a humanoid that was evolved to the point of transcending nature. <br /><br />Now, many may try to argue that humans are still very much dependent on the earth for survival, but that doesn't change the fact that we have certainly gone further than any other known species towards it. The question is, will we reach it? I suspect we won't, much like you can never reach perfection, you can never fully escape depending on the earth to survive. That's sorta besides the point though. <br /><br />What I am trying to get at here is that we just don't know what is going to happen evolutionarily speaking anyways. But, that's not going to stop me from coming up with a theory. And instead of wondering whether it's going to be the right one, I figure why not works towards making it a reality instead? Surely, it's backwards from how things of this type are normally done, coming up with a theory and then trying to not only prove it but make the proof itself happen. <br /><br />So, after all that introduction, here is my theory: Humans are moving in two directions (at least). Forward in evolution, and devolving back to a previous evolutionary form of humans. The forward moving group is where I feel like I belong, while the people who are either intellectually unable to move forward or who actively choose not to. The ""backwards"" group is a product both of the contradiction mentioned above, and from our step outside of natural selection in how we reproduce.&nbsp; I am of course referring to the fact that more people who are low income and poorly educated have large numbers of children, while those who are higher income and more highly educated tend to have fewer children. Of course, this ends up leaving this huge population of people who are doing nothing but hindering the progress of society and using up resources.<br /><br />So, I feel like eventually we are either going to end up with a separation, either peacefully or not so peacefully. The burden of supporting all these wastes of space cannot continue to be the responsibility of everyone else when in reality these people shouldn't exist based on the laws of nature that we can never fully escape from. There's a reason for natural selection, and by circumventing it, we are actually stagnating and slipping backwards.<br /><br />So, instead of some terrible mass death for all these people, I'd like to think that there is a way to solve this problem peacefully. The fact is that the people I'm talking about don't want help anyway, at least that's what they say. Most of them take it anyway, despite not wanting it but that's besides the point. At one time I harbored a desire to see the destruction of society, and sometimes I still do a little, just because it would be easier to start over than fix the mess we are in. But, barring that, we could possibly come up with a plan for co-existence. I have read a lot of sci-fi novels, so I a few things come to mind as examples: <br /><br />In the Sword of Truth series, the author portrays a society controlled similarly to communist Russia where all are to work for to good of others when in actuality it's all just a lie used to control the people who don't care to see the truth of their reality. Those people didn't want help either. The main character solved this dilemma by creating a separate reality for those people to exist in without hindering the rest of the people of that world. There was then a mass exodus from one world to the other of all the people who didn't want to be free. Yes, these people chose to remain enslaved rather than face reality. See the resemblance? Me too.<br /><br />Another example, though less positive, is from the Sparrow. In this book, the author writes about a group of people who find a planet which has life on it, and who travel there to explore it. Well, on that world, there are two senient species, one that is less intelligent and herbivores, essentially they are herd animals. They are the workforce and also the food for the carnivore species, who have controlled the population of the subservient group carefullly in order to ensure that there are not too many of them and also not too few. So that they can survive indefinitely off of the labors of the other group.<br /><br />Now, of the two examples, there are things to learn from both of them. For the first example, obviously I'm not able to create a new mirror of this universe with magic for these people to leave and exist there, so that's not really the point. The point is that these people's minds will not be changed no matter how obvious it gets. So, the best thing to do is let them go. Let them destroy themselves, you can't stop them and trying to just makes you their enemy. Clearly that would lead to the less peaceful solution. <br /><br />Of the second example, I am not suggesting that we become the oppressors of the lower race. That's what I'm going to say for now, because while it's not very PC, neither am I! What i think should be learned from the example is that it is possible to co-exist with unequal populations working together for the common goal of survival.<br /><br />Now, the question is, how do we do that without making people of the lower race angry? Well, by moving ourselves away from them of course! I think at least for the time being it should be something that is not physical, but instead more like providing a place, or a group, or an ideal which people who like me can stand behind and go to when we need help. If we all banded together, given our superior intelligence, we may be able to solve of the more unsolvable problems out there if we just get all the idiots out of the way! So, since in life now we are all interconnected via the internet, and because the internet's main purpose is to freely share information, I think it's the perfect location for the higher race to find a way to co-exist. <br /><br />Once I had come up with my main plan, that of finding a way to separate from these people, I had all kinds of ideas for how to fix things, and even ideas for how to come up with ideas for how to fix things. And even more convoluted than that too, lol! Essentially I want to create an online community where all this would take place, and where people can get to know who else feels this way and see what happens!<br /><br />So, how this is theorized (by me) to work is: we create this think tank, and it does make a difference. Eventually we get to the evolutionary point that I envisioned, and the separation happens in a bigger way. Like, a new name for the lower race, or a new name for the higher race. To avoid the higher-lower thing, since I really don't like putting people down. But I still haven't worked out how to separate from the others, because it's something that's never happened before, and i don't think it really fits to just make a new country or something. It's got to go outside the box, so to speak. That's why the online community is key. The thing is, economically speaking the two groups would still be economically linked and dependent on one another to succeed. What I envision, and I think this separation will happen naturally, with two systems, one designed to maximize your positive affect on society (the higher race) and one designed to allow for those who don't care to take part in the effort. Anyone who wants their life to be easy and they just don't care about whether they make a difference or really accomplish anything of value in their lives. People who desire that, will be offered that as an option, with the reduced potential for growth but with a stable and undemanding career through the system designed to cater to that. That system would be basically the same as what we have now, where businesses choose workers who apply to them for the position they offer. For the higher race system, it would be a different kind of system, designed to help a person reach their highest potential. It would be something where the person seeks the job, and even maybe creates it themselves. <br /><br />It's hard to really do a good job describing what this ideas encompasses. For this system, the change would be that instead of looking at money as being the main indicator of success, it would be merit based, like the people who make the greatest positive difference are who are considered the most successful. This makes perfect logistical sense as well, since it's always been pretty apparent that there is little to no monetary benefit to doing the right thing. Why then, should wanting money be a big priority? Also, starting out there's not going to be money, and really I think it's when money gets involved in something like this that it starts to go awry. So leaving it out is the best way to weed out those who aren't sincere in their wish to rise above our current situation as humans. <br /><br />That's really what it would all be about. So for now, and maybe even always, it will be work done for the sake of the benefit to the greater good. The thing that would need to happen for this, would be that for people who end up choosing to fully turn away from the ""rat race"" of capitalist society, some sort of alternative compensation would be needed. Clearly the needs of survival- food, clothing, housing, etc., would still be necesary, so I think of it as similar to a government position, so you would be paid a very low essentially survival wage along with some benefits like retirement and health insurance. In return you get the satisfaction of doing good and making a positive difference in the world around you. The fact that you are paid is really only to make it possible for you to survive while you do the important work that you have chosen to undertake. <br /><br />Anyways, this is a super mega long post so I'm gonna let this go for now and come back to it. Too many ideas to get them all written down right now, but as you can see I am definitely making some progress here!<br /><br /><div class=""zemanta-pixie""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" alt="""" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=eda5f54f-2809-8572-bc41-35f880a18b5f"" /></div>"

I ended up having to sit on the floor in the kitchen and rest a few. I ate some Kix while I did that and it seemed to help. But yeah, it's pretty much not awesome right now. <br /><br />I wonder why that happens. I mean, I know it's like low blood sugar or whatever, but why do I keep getting such lows (or highs?) that I feel sick like that regularly. I mean, it seems to me that it can't be normal to feel sick so easily from not eating food. In the first place, I ate like 45 minutes ago. What's the deal? <br /><br />Oh well. I feel a little better now. I just have to figure out a way of not being bored but also not working, but look and sound like I am, for one more hour before I get to go home, where it's okay if I feel sick because I can at least eat something to feel better!<br /><br /><div class=""zemanta-pixie""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" alt="""" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=9c3d8298-e8d8-8179-aba5-f34a5a41a5fd"" /></div>"

"event","Indeed. In fact, I don't know why I'm even worried about all kinds of things really, since they are not things that really actually affect me. Other than the worry that I do about them. Luckily, I have an amazing logical mind that can think it's way around that kind of stuff, know it, and then use the knowledge to change from worrying about it to marking it down as a concern, making a mental note of it, you could say. And then letting it go. <br /><br />When I was reading a fantasy novel, (hehe like normal!) the main character, who discovers she's actually a Pixie changeling, was trying to learn how to create things with magic. The kelpie who instructed her told her that the hard part of magic is not visualizing what you want to happen, but actually allowing your energy that you are investing in the task through the visualization leave your body to go do what you intend.<br /><br />I think this is true, in a magic sense and as applied to my problem of worrying about things that don't really matter. Now, it's kinda funny how I just wrote ""and then letting it go"" as if this is such a simple task. Well, much like the above explanation, letting go of emotions is every bit as hard as letting go of magical energy. In fact, as far as I can tell it's pretty much exactly the same. Really, emotions <i>are</i> magical energy. Clearly, I'm not someone who needs reminding of that, given my own magical ability to feel the emotions of others. But none the less, it's still something that I struggle with. <br /><br />I have lately been having the same strange symptoms I had before, in that I have been having panic attack like symptoms, heart racing, nervous, jittery feeling, dizziness and nausea. I'm pretty sure it's a hereditary thing, as my mom has it, and so did my grandmother. I also suspect my mother is herself an empath. I think it's why she ignores people sometimes, and also why she seems to have emotional freak outs from time to time. And it's like I'm feeling what she is giving off, and it's not good, then she feels it off me, then she gets even worse. I really think that she is unaware of her ability, and that is the actual panic attack. Not from her, but from around her. Maybe it's more like she is a sponge, and she soaks up the energies around her, eventually bubbling over into an attack.<br /><br />Who knows. Anyways, for myself, there are things I can do to help. I can do my self a favor, and lay off the extra energy spent creating problems with worries. The other thing I can do is to talk myself down from it when I do feel that. I can separate from it if it's coming from outside of me. I feel like it is, because even if the emotion originates from my brain somewhere, it's not actually coming from me. I mean, it shouldn't be tuned to a hair trigger here. That's not how things are supposed to be. So if I'm like a sponge for emotional energy, what I need to do is learn to either use the energy and continue it's flow out of me, or block it from coming in.<br /><br />Now, that's interesting. Blocking is all well and good, but how do you solve the problem if you've already accumulated it inside you? There needs to be a balance there, and it's natural to think of the movement of energy that way. Okay, so one thing that helps is to expend massive normal energy (aka exercise), so in essence some of the energy you put out is bound to be the excess emotional energy. This is how I envision it works, as this is how exercise for the body versus the mind works, they end up crossing over and becoming a mix of both. But, again, there is a way more efficient way to do it. Brain exercise for example, is a direct way to improve something that is not working in our natural mental skill set. Clearly I'm not meant to burn out my nervous system in this way emotionally, so there is something that I should be doing to expend this energy, something I was made to do. Well, here it is more than clear to me that I am meant to use this energy as a gift, and by not using it, I end up with an overflow. I end up with problems when I can't let go of it. <br /><br />Now I must take away from this contemplation the fact that I am not only meant to use my magic, but I in fact need to use it. Using it, just for anything at all, will help me. Creating something, even not magically, but like painting something or drawing something, or playing music. These things indirectly help expend it. Using my emotions to create something else directly through their application in a spell, now there is something that may even become a cure to all of my current health problems. <br /><br />Well, I'm going to finish up here for now, as this got really deep and pretty much became a magic post too, so I'm totally gonna reblog it now too. Heck yeah multitasking. <br /><br /><br /><div class=""zemanta-pixie""><img class=""zemanta-pixie-img"" alt="""" src=""http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=26d1377a-37da-84f9-b6a9-b57d44de2d97"" /></div>"

It's a conflicting thing somewhat, though I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way often.<br /><br />The mind can be a confusing jumble of contradictions for suresies! I myself am often confounded by my own emotions and thoughts. I mean, it just makes no sense really why sometimes something doesn't bother me a bit and other times that same exact situation would make me so mad I can hardly stand it! Mostly though things don't bother me.<br /><br />One thing that I do think that makes no sense, is that I am a slacker who always has like 5 projects half done. While I do have probably at least that many projects half done, it doesn't serve any purpose at all to criticize myself about it, thus making it even harder for me to finish the half done projects now that I feel bad about it. Just silly, really. <br /><br />But besides beating myself up about silly things that are really just hobbies that I haven't finished, which somehow relate back to my self worth in my goofy brain, I am doing pretty well right now. <br /><br />Today marks one whole week of no pains or digestive upset episodes. In addition, I am pretty well on top of most of my responsibilities, so life if fairly alright today.<br /><br />I've got a few things I'd like to get finished this weekend, mostly wedding related stuff. Like painting some invites, and talking to our caterer dude. Well, the due who we want to be our caterer anyways. I also need to talk to my best friend's brother about his band. I think it would be awesome to have him play at our wedding for part of the reception. <br /><br />But yeah, that's about all I really need to get done. Oh, that and order save the date cards for sending out. Once those are sent out the next big thing I've gotta send to people or whatever will be the invites themselves. Boy, it's getting pretty close already, weird how fast time can seem to go sometimes. Especially when it seems to move so ridiculously slowly at times like right now, when I'm at my desk ""working"" as they say.

"event","Okay not really, but sometimes it kinda does! I can feel it when people are upset, and usually, if they are in close proximity to me, it can be intense. Makes me feel things, like nervousness, anger, sadness, whatever it may be, but feeling that stuff for just yourself if tough, but feeling it from other people too, well that's just plain rough sometimes.<br /><br />Today for example. One of the attorneys at my office comes up to the doorway near my desk of another attorney's office. Probably less than five feet away. Right when she got near, I could feel how flustered, frustrated and/or upset she was, in addition to some insecurity I think. Anyhow, that little jolt of emotion was really noticeable, lol. Whenever anyone gets too near me while they are feeling things strongly, it's like I'm some kind of sensor!<br /><br />Bleh to that. But I have had a pretty good day today. I've done some good things I needed to do personally and I've done a bunch of work! Amazing, huh? Oh Thursday, when did you become such a productive day! Of course, Fridays are productive up until about noon. Well, maybe like 2ish. On a good day. Which is totally going to be tomorrow, so that I can finish up this week feeling good.

But today has also been crazy so here is me resting a lil' and taking a good break writing out my frustrations and thoughts and misc! Mhmm it's a good thing. Today I have felt like I'm juggling thirty things at once and they are all on fire!<br /><br />But, the good thing is is makes the day go by so fast. <br /><br />So, this weekend I was super mega uber excited because I had lots of fun plans for Halloween and our anniversary. I was also excited about our honeymoon in the Dominican Republic! Yeah, so I geared up for that Friday night and Saturday morning. Then our plans got rearranged a little bit because we hung out with people and trimmed at chez Dix Sunday instead of Saturday. It worked out good though. Sorta rushed but okay mostly. We did wander around Ashland a bit before our insanely good tasting dinner at Kobe on Sunday. Couldn't find the place at first, even though I have been there before! We got it figured out though. <br /><br />I loved the Cabin in the Snow sake we drank, it was really good. Everything was really good actually.<br /><br />I did have a weird thing happen that evening. After dinner, when we got home we went out like normal, then came back inside and I thought about doing some baking. In the end I didn't bake anything, but while I was standing there looking up recipes on the kitchen laptop, my vision did a weird thing. It was like everything was shaking a little bit back and forth sideways. It was really weird. Then I closed my eyes some and relaxed and it went away. I have no idea what it was but it was kinda scary!<br /><br />I kinda think I should look it up online and see what I can find.

"event","So... I guess the CSS on lj is totally broken. Lame. Serious.

Anyways. Besides being annoyed by the retarded looking page here, I am fairly alright. Yesterday a couple of things happened that I have since been pondering.

I had some really disturbing dreams. Well, they were when I woke up anyways. I think I killed someone. Either I did, or someone else did and then I was doing something with the corpse. The first dream I had cut an opening in the corpse (it was headless already) and I was removing bones one at a time. It was quite gruesome. In the next dream I had stabbed someone (or someone else did) and I was standing over them with a big knife and I got blood on my shoe. Then I was worried that someone would find out that I did it if they saw my shoe, and I wasn't able to go into my apartment or dorm or whatever to stop them from finding the evidence. These were strange because I didn't remember doing the actual killing, just the afterwards part, and it was like I was numb to it. Very strange, and I haven't told anyone about the dreams because I don't want to freak them out.

Then yesterday I had my annual review. It was mostly good, but my boss said that he had gotten complaints from others that I was watching tv and doing light reading while I was at work and it had ""ruffled some feathers"". He didn't seem too concerned, but I am annoyed by it. Granted I shouldn't be doing those things, but why don't they just talk to me about it or something. It bothers me because it just seems like they are talking behind my back and being sneaky and mean about it. What is the point of that anyways? If I had work to do I would be doing it. What do they want me to do, just stare at a spot on the wall until I have something to do! Jerks.

Bleh, it just makes me mad thinking about it. Today I spent pretty much the whole day doing my website audit. Which is a pretty lame way to spend my day, I'll tell you. Sooo boring. Luckily I had my ipod in my purse from this weekend so I had music to listen to!

I haven't felt overly magical lately and it was bothering me. But the last couple days I feel I have had a revival of sorts. I'm not sure why really, except that I did have a good talk with Ryan. It was cool because he is starting to show some interest in it. He wanted to talk about what his special skills magically might be. I pondered it based on the type of person he is, and I came to the conclusion that he would be a good seer. He is so contemplative and wise, it's like time is passing differently to him. He is naturally calm and thoughtful. Then to my surprise he said that he often has dreams which end up coming true, and not just like, a vague event occuring, but entire conversations that he dreamt, word for word. That's really cool! So I am hoping to talk with him more about that and maybe see if he is interested in nurturing it. At the same time, I always have a hard time with sharing things that I don't want to share with everyone in my life with him because he always seems to think that it's ok to just tell people whatever you want, and I am not like that.

For example, when I first had him smoke pot with me, he started talking to all kinds of random people about it, which if you do something like that casually, is a huge huge no-no. You just don't do that! Even if they are your friend. You really have to know they are cool with it first and aren't going to throw a big fit (who wants to hear that) break off the friendship, or even turn you in to your employer or the police. It's just something that people know, and he didn't understand. I explained it to him after, but even then he is way more open about it that I am comfortable with. I think the reason is he has the desire for others to see him a certain way and often he feels that telling them about it will make them think that way. I think. I know people who were like that so that's my guess. But for me it's more of just a really enjoyable pasttime and not something I feel the need to share with random people like that. 

And Wicca, well, that's even bigger for me. Much more important that he restrains himself, because that is something very private to me. Granted I write about it in here, but I don't even know fi there's anyone who reads this! Plus I figure that if someone is going to read my journal a certain amount of understanding and respect for privacy is in order. Mostly i like it because it's a place where I can store these writings forever and look back on them later, which is neat."

"event","So, the last few weeks I have come home and thought, yuck it smells like the litter box in here! Bleh! But it sucked because I would empty the litter and it would still stink. And sometimes I would think I smelled cat pee when I was in the living room. I hadn't found the location yet tho.

Well, last night while we were watching a movie, I found it. He has been peeing in this one corner over and over again. The carpet and drywall are completely ruined;; It's just terrible. I had to imprison him in the bathroom with his catbox and food and water. I was so worried that I would have to get rid of him that I cried a bunch last night and this morning when I was talking to my parents about it. I really love him and don't want to have to get rid of him;;

This morning I was on a mission right away when I got to work. I checked out about.com:Cats which was actually a great resource. They had all kinds of information about what to do about this. I feel like me and Scoot can get through this! I am going to take him to the vet tomorrow just to make sure he isn't sick, because they said that sometimes cats do this because of being sick. Also I am going to make some changes around the house to help. I am going to increase the changing of his litter because he is the type of cat who doesn't want to spend time in the litterbox, and so I think that means he doesn't like the smell. I will make a point of cleaning it out everyday when I get home from work, and then I will empty it every other day. I may have to spend more on litter, but really it's worth it if he doesn't do this again. I may also get a second litterbox for him so that he has two. 

One thing that's hard is I have to balance what is right for him and what Ryan is willing to do. He doesn't want another litterbox. He doesn't like having the one we have now even, so another one would be even worse. But I think it might help. I will talk to Ryan and try to work out a compromise. 

It turns out that the imprisonment is what I should do with Scooter. It says that you should have a retraining period when the cause of the problem is not easily understood just to make sure your cat is retrained to use his box. And you spend time with them and let them out but with supervision so that you can be sure that they aren't doing the wrong things again. 

I am also considering some scents for the house which will help scooter with his stress level. He seems to be stressed out often, and will get scared very easily so it might be good to try that too. It might be that when he's scared he goes outside the box because he is too worried to go in his box. 

Another problem with our current setup at the house is that his food is near his box, and he might not like that. I will need to see if there is a way to solve that problem too, maybe by moving his food to a different spot to see if that helps. I don't want to do too much though because he doesn't do well with change either!

I am really really hoping it works out because I would be very heartbroken if I had to give Scooter away."

"event","Today I have that comfortable sleepy feeling, like you get when you are little and your mom is stroking your hair or something. It's such a nice feeling. I really like it. I have had a pretty good day so far, though I am bummed that hulu is websensed now so I can't watch some of the shows that I used to anymore. I do still have work I can do, but I don't really like doing it so it's easier if I have some sort of incentive to use to motivate myself. 

I went shopping at the mall on my lunch and it was really fun! And I was good and didn't buy the thing I really really wanted that was super cute! It's a black Sunny Leigh skirt with a small ruffle on the bottom, with a black top with pink polka dots. The top has that crumpled up thing going on that masks belly fat. I also web shopped for a bit and found a ton of cute things I want to buy from this store that the recessionista recommended. Sadly there weren't any things in my size, though really that is fortunate because it prevents me from buying something that I do not need. So, today I had fun shopping, and I found stuff that I wanted but I didn't buy it. I am planning to save up a spare $80 (the total cost of the shirt and skirt and then go back and get them! Also maybe they will be more on sale later on too! Or, I decide I don't really want them anyways, not that I expect to though, I am one of those people who don't change their minds easily about things.

I have woken up a little bit somehow, and lost my comfortable feeling. What a bummer, I was enjoying it. Maybe I will slip back into it a little later. That would be good. 

So last night we had dynamis with our group, and we had a really really good run! We actually got a ton of things for people, and I even got something too! I got my Red Mage body AF2 which I have been wanting for many years. It's neat that I got it, because it's a really nice piece of armor.I don't know if I will play tonight or not, because I have other stuff I want to do too.

One goal I have is to do these three little chores: dishes, put away the clean clothes, and file the pile of stuff I have on my desk! I think I can do it! I need to make more room in my file cabinet because my drawer is mega full. Either I can get rod of some stuff that I don't need anymore or I can expand into the next drawer. I will have to take a look and see. All in all, I don't expect my chores to take more than 1 hour total, so really there is no reason not to do it^^

Oh! I forgot about my delicious dessert I made! I have been trying to be good and eat a little healthier, along with sticking with workouts, which has been going quite well for me. I have lost some weight and some of my clothes are fitting looser than before. I still have some to lose before I will be at my ideal size, but I'm doing fairly well. In that vein I looked up low fat desserts that I can have instead of the things I normally get as a result of wanting sweet stuff all the time. I found a recipe for angel food cake, and decided to make angelfood cupcakes! They turned out fabulous. I also made an egg white frosting which ended up being exactly like marshmallow fluff. I dyed it pink and added raspberry flavoring. And then cinnamon sprinkles to top it all off. The leftover batter I made into a small cake and frosted it with the remaining frosting, so I also have a yummy cake. It's a bit much for just one person to eat, so I am going to bring the cake to work to share for valentines day! The coolest thing about it is the whole thing is fat free, and it just tastes so very very good. I'm sure everyone at my work will like it too. 

Valentine's is Saturday, and I don't really have any plans! Granted, I can't really afford to make plans in the first place so it makes sense that I wouldn't have plans, but it would be kinda fun to have something to do that day, lol. I won't get my hopes up that Ryan planned something, as then I would be disappointed if he didn't. Maybe we'll just have a nice dinner then, and some cupcakes for dessert! Mmmmm!"

"event","Well, i discovered a new blog to read, called the recessionista blog, and it is written by a person who has similar desire to dress well for less. I am less fashion conscious then some, but I want to be more so, and I often like to shop during big sales to find something that looks good but doesn't cost much. 

She has lots of cool stuff in there, so that is pretty cool. She finds online sales that have good deals on designer stuff. I don't know if I can afford the sales, because I literally have less than the amount I need of income as it is. Once I get caught up on my bills and stuff I should be able to pay it, but right now I'm just stuck with how it is.

Ohhh good idea! I can do my taxes at work tomorrow! That will save me some time, and I can find out how much I will be getting back! I plan to pay off my computer, and if there's some left, pay some of my credit line too. I am hoping to have all that crap paid off soon, so that I can move forward! Gah, it's tough though you know? The economy makes it harder to save and be ahead of the game. But I just have to keep moving forward ^^ It will work out for the best I'm sure.

This weekend we went up to Hyatt Lake with my parents, and it was soooo fun! I really had a great time. When Chuck and Ann, and Gayle and Laurie, and Kim and Harv all came up to hang out with us, it's just such a happy environment so I just can't help but feel a joy that makes me feel almost high or something lol. It's so wonderful. It's something that reminds me that you can't have the same feelings from interacting with others online as in person. It's not the same because you don't have the contact. It's a one-way thing. You can't have the same joy, or the sadness, it has less feeling, and therefore, in my opinion, less meaning too. 

I haven't been able to stick to my list from below very well, though I did get caught up with things for the most part last night, and so I do feel like I am in a little better shape. At least my chores are done. I need to get all my stuff filed but that can wait I suppose. 

One game related thing that kinda sucks is that we were gone this weekend and things sort of fell apart in our group sa a result. This sucks because it makes it harder for us to be able to go out of town when we want to. And I don't intend to change my life plans for that game. No way. But I feel bad that our group would suffer as a result. So, what I need to do is find someone who is as competent as me to take over when I am not around for Dynamis. I have seen what a difference it makes when I'm not there, and it shouldn't be like that. I should be able to miss it and not have things totally fall apart.

Welp, this evening should be nice, as I don't really have any other stuff I have to do, and I am doing yoga at lunch today, so I should be able to be free all evening for things I want/need to do. I at least feel rested today, that is a good thing!"

"event","Yeah it's a lame title. I just wasn't sure where this post would go, so I decided to just put something random in there that doesn't relate to my post. 

I have been sick for the past week, which has sucked. I have been contemplating many things, and really quite busy with my many things I am juggling. I an feeling a little sick right now, in my stomach for some reason, and I have a weird pain in my ribs. I get it sometimes, and I think it's either some kind of indigestion thing, or it's a result of hunching in my chair and crushing my ribs with my boobs. They are really heavy, so I think sometimes that's what happens. 

I have so many different directions that I get pulled in. There's the anime community, and the episodes that come out, and my reviews that I write. There's my artwork, and the graphic projects I think up. There's FFXI, my linkshell, and my friends, and the events I want to do, the items I want to get, the jobs I want to level. There's my workouts, skiing, and outdoor activites. There's my spiritual work, meditation, visualization, and spells. Learning Japanese, sewing projects, baking and cooking things. 

So many things. I just don't have the time to pursue it all. Even though I have been spending most of my work time on things like that too, it's still makes me so incredibly busy. It's a good thing, to be this blessed, and I am not bummed about it at all. Nor do I think I should stop doing some of these things. I just sometimes feel guilty about neglecting some things, and I think (and write in here) about how I really need to do this, I should have done that, etc. And I make myself feel bad about not having time for things like chores and keeping my more boring life details in order, like paying bills and filing paperwork. 

I want to find a good balance of them. One thing I think I should do is make a priority list. Maybe make one each month, and then I can use that to remind myself of what is most important for me in that month. I should weigh my thoughts, feelings and desires about my life, and where I want to go, and what brings me the most happiness. 

Here goes nothing!

1. Wicca stuff. This seems to order my life, and it fits into everything else so nicely. It makes me happy and it's good for me. Should give myself this time.
2. Life details. A little effort goes a long way. Keeping on top of this makes my stress level go down. I need to do filing, keep to a budget, pay bills, and keep on top of my chores.
3. Art, being creative. I need this outlet, it can be any and all of the creative things I like to do. I need to keep this time too.
4. Workouts. Exercise is so good for me. It is mental and physical well-being, and also reduces stress. 
5. Anime and the fansub community. I have had some positive feelings about this group, I have made friends and I have enjoyed writing the reviews. I love to watch it.
6. FFXI. On the same level as anime, in fact these are really tied, but because it is so much easier for me to do anime stuff at work it beats this.
7. Japanese. Goes along with fansub in that I do this almost wholly at work. It's a great thing to learn new things. It enriches my life. 

I contemplated making time slots for these things. While that seems like a great idea, I am not the kind of person who could easily stick to it. I have the ability to, I just don't want to. I want it to be spontaneous. I think this list will help me to keep things in the right order. 

Alright, I feel better already. And isn't that the point to everything? 

Time to switch topics then. I have a friend on fansub who actually is the person who pointed me towards wicca and magic back when I first started looking into it. It's because of him really that it all came to be! Pretty cool. Anyways, so recently we have been exchanging messages on the forums about magic. It has been fun because I feel like the more I talk about it the more solidified things get in my mind, the ideas become complete ideologies for me. But i like talking to people about it, and I just sent him a really really log message, and it kinda got me all fired up you know?

I was thinking it would be good to record my thoughts in here too so that I can have them down in the same place as the other thoughts I have written here. By the way (sidenote alert) I was thinking about it, and what a wealth of information something like this would be later! It's full of my day-to-day life details. If I were a famous person, it could be made into a book or something! Really, it could anyways. One thing I was thinking about doing was writing a book. That would be pretty fun, and it would be a new challenge for me! And yet another creative outlet. Also I could write it at work, so there would be plenty of time to work on it, lol. My job is so awesome. Jeez, I just veered right off the track with my train of thought there huh? I seem to be going in many directions today.

Back to the topic. I told him about my experience with the elemental that I had. I wanted to relate to his spell to wake up a tree that he told me about. After telling it, then I wrote about how I am a fire person so fire and water don't really mix. Which is and isn't true I guess. I mean, they actually mix quite a bit. Granted, the fire heats the water and changes it into steam, but this is not a destruction, it's just a change. Maybe that's why the water elemental was there when I was there, maybe that's why it was inviting me. I think I am still afraid of the power of that entity, so I have a new plan. 

This plan is a good one I think. What I intend to do is do some meditation at a time when I feel quiet and ready. I will prepare myself for an astral journey. I will do mental exercises to be ready for it. I can then go to the place where the elemental is. To make it easier, I will cast a circle, and call to the spirit and ask it to meet me at the place we met before. I will then travel to Hyatt in my mind. This should be a good place because when I close my eyes, I can see it before me anyways. I will do this, and I will then be able to communicate easier, and at the same time, be safe from physical harm, and also more powerful. I am certain that I am more powerful when in an astral journey, as you are no longer limited by your body or your surroundings. I can fly through the air, see what I am seeking, talk to what I am meeting. This might bring me some answers to my own purpose, as well as hopefully help the spirit that I had found. I feel sometimes like it is waiting for me, watching over me. Which is interesting considering that this spirit is significantly more powerful, and in a completely different plane of existence to me. A higher power, even. And yet, I do feel that it is needing something. I wasn't sure of this until my friend asked me about it. It's great how someone else helps so much in bringing things to light.

The other part of my message to him was about my possible empath powers. I think it helped to remind myself of this. I have started to fall back into not really thinking about it. It's hard for me to grasp it so it's hard for me to believe it and to find it even helpful. I'm still not entirely sure about it, but I do feel things, that is true. Why and whether it's from me or someone else is still not solidified. 

At any rate, I don't think I should dismiss it. I think it's important for me to learn more about it, test it, and maybe even control it."

"event","Well, to start off I should tell the story that leads to what I am going to say in this post. yesterday morning I was laying in bed not wanting to get up, when in the corner of my eye I saw one of the plants in the bedroom, but it looked like my RDM hat, and it gave me a good idea for a drawing! Feeling brimming with the idea, and needing to draw it, I decided to take a sketchbook to work with me so that I could draw what I was thinking of. And draw it I did. In fact, it was such a good drawing. More than I even was imagining. This is probably one of the first times that I have drawn something better than I was even thinking of. That's amazing. I don't even really know what to think about that. 

And then today I was thinking about it, and I think it's my spell. I think this is a sign that I should be doing more drawings at work, so I have decided to keep a sketchbook here at work with me to continue to create more and more. 

There have been a few things happening lately, including this. I also learned about different artists online that I think have helped me to solidify what I like to do and what kinds of things inspire me the most. 

Another thing happened, that isn't related to artwork, but is related to wicca stuff. There was a person on the Wiccan community online who I thought was someone I could be in a coven with. I sent a friend request but there wasn't a response right away. She just accepted my request and sent me a message back asking to know more about me. I am excited about that because I kept having these dreams about needing to find a coven, and this person had mentioned in her profile that she was interested in starting one. It would be so great to be able to have a group to celebrate and practice magic with. 

Learning the runes has been a great experience as well. I see many opportunities for use of them in my practice, as well as learning more about the nordic mythology along the way. I feel connected to it as a result of my nationality, since I am mostly german, norwegian and a mix of other european descents. 

Essentially, I have been feeling very inspired lately. So blessed and loved, and so connected to my world. What a wonderful time of my life!"

Yesterday I was browsing fansub.tv and I came across the awards page, for users of the site to vote for each other, and I was nominated by several people as the best critic! This is surely a result of my blog where I make posts about anime I'm watching, but that's so cool! People read my blog, and they like it, what a complement.

Yesterday was also Ryan's birthday, so we went out to eat and went to see Gran Torino. That movie was simply incredible. I just loved it. I cried a bunch at the end. But man, I enjoyed that film. The best movie for Clint Eastwood, hands down. I'm sure it will be winning Oscars.

I am still reading my Runes book, I don't get very far each night as I have been up too late and really tired, but I'm about halfway if I recall correctly. I am planning to take a few of the runes and combine them to create my own Runic symbol for me and my household, essentially. Also I am going to create my own set of the runes for rune casting, and incorporate them into my spells. I really feel connected to this magic because it is from my heritage, and it seems to relate to my beliefs well also. I am super glad I bought this book! Which reminds me, I need to return the library book I have. Gah, I need to remember to do that tomorrow so I don't get more fines lol. I currently have 80 cents in fines lol.

"event","My my! It has been almost a whole month since I made a post in my journal. This is probably because I have been pretty busy at work plus I have been pursuing some personal projects at work as well.

One thing I did was I learned how to use Photoshop and Illustrator. I already knew, but there were things that I didn't know, or that I was only able to do a certain way which was more time consuming than necessary. It was good learning for me!

I also watched some videos about various intellectual and artistic things. That was fun, and I learned stuff too! TED.com is a pretty cool site, they have all kinds of things on there.

After that I decided to see what other things I could watch while at work and I discovered some anime I could watch along with other tv shows on hulu.com. I then, of course, watched a ton of anime! It was great. I watched shikabane hime: aka and death note on there. That was probably the awesomest thing I could spend my day doing in my opinion, so yay for that. I was getting paid to watch anime.... my dream has come true! Yippeee!

So, you could say that my near month of absence on here was well spent. Other than that, I have been busy playing ffxi again on my non-work time because we started our own dynamis/endgame shell. We have more than 30 members and it seems to be going fairly well so far^^ I am excited about that, but at the same time I don't want game playing to start coming before my life. So far I have been able to balance it pretty well. 

I have also been going cross country skiing! Yay! It's been fabulous. The other day I went up to Hyatt Lake, and as I was skiing I found a water elemental. It was very interesting. I could really feel the power there. 

Magically speaking, I am currently reading up on Runes. I got a barnes and noble gift card for Christmas so I used it to get two books, one about runes and one that is a philosophical look at doubt and people who have been influential in society as a result of their doubts. I think it sounds fascinating! The runes book is already awesome even though I just started reading it. I plan to make my own Rune set and use it for magical purposes. I am excited to finish reading the book!

Hmm what else have I been doing? Oh, this and that I suppose. The Wyld Stallyns got together and jammed a bit, you know, stuff like that. Yes, that is the name of Bill and Ted's band. Yes, we made a band name in Rock Band called that. It's awesome!

The other night I had a disturbing set of dreams. It was not good. In one, Bob my old boss was badly hurt, like bandaged and blood was coming through the bandages. I felt compelled to touch him and take away his pain. It makes me a little sick thinking of it. And then there was a really really weird one, where I met the CEO of the company i work for and he was nice, and then for some reason I was waiting for him at a hotel room and I wanted to have sex with him even though he's old and gross and I would never want to normally. 

Yeah... so I really hated both of them, and I don't get what they mean. I do find it interesting that now in almost all of my dreams I use magic in my hands to solve problems. I was pondering why I have the dreams I do and what my eventual ""reason for being"" is, and I had a thought this morning. I think I need to learn to see/feel more clearly the energies around me so that I can influence them. I can fight against bad forces! And help heal people. Maybe that is it.

Seems reasonable, I have always had a strong sense of justice and all that. Tonight I am going to go to the grocery store. Bleck I say! But I really need to. No more negativity though, because I want to get the food! Mhmm.

I was mad at Ryan last night because he has been home all this time and has really done absolutely nothing around the house. But I just talked to him and he is cleaning the kitchen right now, so at least he is doing it now. I feel like sometimes if left to his own devices he would let his whole life fall to pieces because it's easier than dealing with things once they all get piled up. Not to uncommon huh? But, I am not like that. I can't have things up in the air like that, I just can't.

And afterwards I felt really good about it. I also was kinda thinking that I might be having some influences around me. I keep thinking that there are pixie-like beings around me, watching over me now. I know that's weird, but it's how I personify the forces at work I guess. At least right now. I didn't think of it that way before. But I asked for help, and I think I am getting it!

Next week I am going to work more on things that enable me to become successful, because it's really important that you do whatever you can in the physical world to support what you ask for help with. It's always important to do that, I think. Otherwise, it's really just laziness.

I am excited for the new computer that I bought too! Yay! It gets here Monday. I am poor, but I really do need it, my current one is gonna die soon prolly, and it's so old now that I can't run some programs, the most important of which is Adobe CS3, which I need for art stuff. But yeah, this new one I got is incredibly awesome!

I have been having this pain in my belly region. I don't know what to make of it. It kinda feels like my implant is out of whack in there or something. Not as bad pain as like, it being totally in the wrong place, just like, ajar or something. That's my guess anyways. I hope its not more than that. It should right itself eventually. Also, I should go in for my yearly exam here soon too. That is overdue I think.

I also need to go to the dentist. And my car needs $600 worth of work. Where will this money come from ;; I don't have it to spend;; I need to work on that today, I just realized. Find the money in my finances to pay for all this business.

Ok, well as you know, I have been building my website at work for a while. Yesterday I registered a domainname - carlyharr.com - which I intended to use for the site. My brother was nice enough to offer to let me host on his server, which was totally awesome of him. He also helped me work out some little hiccups with godaddy, who I used to register it.

Then today I spent several hours fine tuning and perfecting my website files in preparation for uploading them. Well, to my dismay they would not upload! It gave me an error message every time. So, when I get hom tonight I will talk with Kirk and get it all straightened out. So you could say that I had a ""failure to launch"" on my website today! Lol.

Other than that, today has been glorious. A good day all around really. 

One thing though, I need to take my car in to the shop to get it's oil changed/leak fixed. And money-wise I'm a bit thin lol. so, I have made the decision to use my credit card to get it done because I really shouldn't be driving around with the oil level this low. 

Earlier this morning I also worked on finishing all my Christmas Shopping. Right now I only have my mom and my brother left! I got some awesome shirts for cheap from Threadless, which was great. I need to figure out what to get Kirk. 

And last night I did some body/mind/spirit cleansing. Boy it was nice. Then it was dinner, random stuff, and then bed! I love life =^^="

"event","I don't know why but today I feel yucky. My head hurts and I'm just not in a good mood. It sucks because I want to be;; Maybe it's also from the whole, needing to deal with money stuff too. I need to return one of my gifts for Ryan because it was too much money. It shouldn't have cost what it did, so I need to take care of getting it reduced down to the right amount. I also spent too much money this weekend on gas and such too as a result of all the travelling and stuff.

Maybe that's making me feel sick? I'm not sure. I do feel sick though. Looks like no yoga for me today. Going to yoga while sick is a bad idea. Any time i do that I really feel sick during/afterwards. But what a bummer;; Being sick really sucks!

I will just have to do my best to stave it off by getting rest and eating healthy and such. 

But I had a good weekend and birthday and holiday! So that's good^^ Yeah I hung out with friends in Bend, went out on my birthday, spent time with my family, ate yummy food, saw a movie, and lots more good stuff!

Diane gave me acool book for my birthday, so that's awesome too! Yay for books. 

I did some studying of my japanese this weekend too. I have all the hiragana symboks memorized now. I now need to learn vocab, sentence construction, and katakana. Not too shabby! But I will start with the katakana. I am hoping that it isn't too confusing, moving from one language set to another like this."

"event","Boy, what an angry post yesterday! I think it was good though, expressing my feelings seems to have diffused the situation for me. Rants, for me, make me see the truth in the matter, and be able to put my thoughts down and walk around them, to come up with the right thing. 

Today I had time to do some wicca studying. It was great because I learned a bunch of neat things! The coolest was probably an article on the Physics of Magic. It was so cool to see the way that fundamental theories of the way things exist in this workd are flawed in science, and that there are things that cannot be explained through the scientific theory. Quantum Physics really is fascinating! Those were simple experiments, but even then, I was almost over my head lol. Mostly becuase I have not studied quantum physics, so I was not familiar with some of the basic assumptions about matter and things which were used as a basis for the experiment. Boy was it ever interesting though.

The one thing that I feel I am spending my time with these days, is discovering my path. I keep having these dreams of battle. Where my group is the underdogs, but they are fighting with powerful weapons to keep the opposition from taking them over. It wasn't like we were seeking this, the others seeked us. Essentially it was like a disease or an evil spirit. 

ONe night I was about the fall asleep, lying in bed. My eyes were picking up on things that I normally cannot see. I was seeing shapes and movement around me. As I was falling asleep, much like what would occasionally happen, I saw a scary monster spirit over me. Normally I just have scary half-dreams which make me wake up. In this case, I stuck my hands out, and they had fire in them. I burned up the bad spirit with my fire. It was neat because I no longer felt afraid you know?

Then that night I dreamt of going to a big coven gathering and then being attacked by bad spirits. We were all fighting together against them, me with my fire hands, Shana from SHakugan No Shana with a Joyeuse from FFXI, and a lady who looked like Nicole Kidman with maimed arms shooting her mannequin hands into them and then reclaiming them. It was intense. 

But I think it is an important sign for me. I need to meditate on that fact. Part of me is sure that I am a warrior, but I do not know what to fight for, or anything. I am just starting out. I need a direction.

More on this later. Time for work to end, just about!"

I'm pretty sure it was Dustin. If he only knew my hatred for him. See, I don't like him. Not even a little. In fact, I have this deep seeded distrust of him and all the he purports to stand for. For one thing, everything he tells me is a lie. Well, I'm not going to give him the satisfaction of knowing that I am mad that he stole my magazine. That would not be worth it.

He will return and smugly purport that he tricked me. Well, considering he didn't trick anyone, I was not at my desk, it's not too tricky to come over here and take something off of my desk that's right here! Of course, he could have tried to hide it. I will check that out after the walk. Oooooh if he tries to act all smug and retarded, I will have to try hard not to hit him. 

Goal #1: Do not hit Dustin today.

Goal #2: Do not acknowledge his existence.

Goal #3: Be happy all day! =^^=

I think that's wat more than is deserved to have that many sentences devoted to someone as useless and despicable as him. 

Oh my! So busy after I started this entry. I feel a little bad about writing all of that, but it's actually true, so I'm gonna leave it. It's about that time eh chap? Why yes, indeed it is. YOGA TIME~"

I could win an ftv award, and then I would have one of those cool things in my sig like the sempais do, something like ""best blogger"" Man, that would be so AWESOME! 

I did a bunch of posting and such too, I even wrote a poem about my favorite meadow up at the cabin =^^= I love that place, mhmm! I also love bananas! Mmmm, I'm eating one right now. Lol, in fact last night I dreamt of being at the store and buying bananas. I think I may have had a child with me, my child? Jeez I dunno. I remember buying a bunch of bananas though. Like 7. One that I picked out by itself because it was perfect. I wonder if that's allowed, picking a banana from the bunch. I guess it is, I just always felt like I shouldn't.

Though, I do feel guilty for dumb things liek that. Like when the diabetes people were trickery and sent me a letter with a nickel inside and asked me to send it back. Every nickel counts, they say. Well, I felt bad not sending it. Then I got mad at them for making me feel bad, how dare they pull something like that, they are supposed to be good guys! SO then I took the nickel off and threw the letter away.

And yesterday when I got the invoice for my 6 free issues of People, I felt bad not responding right away to say, no I don't want more issues after the 6 free ones. Yeah, what the heck lol. I mean, they chose to do that, it's not my fault, but now I see a direct mail ploy to make people feel guilty if they don't do what you asked them too. Passive aggressive mail? I think so! Another mail conspiracy unfolds here in my journal! Awesome.

Ooooh 15 minutes until lunchtime! That means I can go watch all my kids, yay! I bet today and tomorrow exciting things will happen, since its the end of the week. They like to leave you hanging on Friday so you wonder all weekend. NOt me though, I just like to have something like that to watch when I work out because it's funny and I get engaged in the story so I don't think about the running part. It's a good strategy.

Oh man, breaking news! Nevermind about all my kids, or about lunch being soon. It's totally not. Bob needs to take lunch at 12:15 so he is going to be at lunch during all my kids so I will have to take a later lunch after all!

Oh well, I can watch without a trace instead."

Yep, and then I sloshed it around a bit on the walk back to work. You could say that my belly was a bit angry with me. And you would be right.

So today when I checked my blog, I was really excited because I had 63 visits and like 150 page views on it! Really exciting! People actually read it! I thought it was cool because I do work hard on it you know. It helps me to flesh out how I feel about the shows and stuff too, which is good because now there is a thread where everyone lists thier top 5 for the week and then it gets tallied up for that week. It's cool because I think the way people feel about a show changes over time and this way you get a good idea about shows you might not have seen, and whether they are worth watching.

Last night was a good night. I talked to Ryan a bit about how happy we have been lately. I kinda think of him as my anchor or something. He is the person I come home to, the one who comforts me and cares about me. And I hope that I am doing the same for him. 

It has helped me to understand more about why I get the feelings I do around others. I really would like to have more of an understanding of why and what I should be doing about it. I think the answers will come with time. Now that I have discovered this, it has become so much easier to understand.

I have also been practicing my mental shield. Like, whenever I go downstairs at night alone, I always get a little freaked out on my way back upstairs, like someone is lurking there to get me. It's a bit of a phobia I suppose. Happens when I go outside at night alone too sometimes. Last night when that happened, I imagined my shield, and the fear was gone. Fabulous. 

I think one thing I may need to try is this cool spell I read about where you empower your regular cleaning supplies at the house to be spiritual cleaners too. So that way it protects your home from outside influences that you don't want. I will have to see if that works. I am wondering if my unreasonable fear actually has a reason. That will be interesting to find out.

Well, there's some work for me so I'll see about getting it done now, that way I'll have some time for reading this afternoon hopefully!

"event","Well, today has been better than, for example, yesterday. More like my wonderful weekend. Last weekend was so nice! It was like Ryan and I were both just so happy and we had such a nice time together all weekend. 

I feel that way today. I also felt that way when I got home last night. I am starting to get better at blocking negative energy. I notice it, and I put up a shield to keep it from getting to me. It has worked really well.

One thing that was weird last night, when I was sleeping I was cuddling with Ryan, which was really nice^^ but then I started visualizing my shield, and him being under it. Then I started imagining my mind traveling down his arm from where my hand was touching his, and it felt like I was leaving m body and moving to his, and I got scared that I wouldn't be able to come back to my body. I don't know why, but it just felt like I would stop breathing if I didn't keep focusing on it, and when I think about my body I lose the connection to his. Very weird. 

Thats ok though. I feel like the visualization is helping me a lot. Regardless of whether I am truly an empath, or whatever I am, I am happier now, and no longer feel like I am not the person I want to be anymore. 

Before you know I felt like I was not a good person, even though I wanted to be. I felt like I was hurting others all the time, and I couldn't control it. Now I feel like I am in control, and I am able to help others and be happy myself.

I was thinking, if I am an empath, am I picking up on Ryan's love for me and that is why we are so happy lately? That would be really cool. The other reason I think is that I am totally content with him. He has really worked hard to make it so that he is doing a better job of keeping up his end of the responsibilities of our household and that makes me happy too. Now there's not a lot about him that really makes me upset because the way he is now is so well fit to me and who I am. Yay, I love him so much!"

"event","Well, this whole empath thing is still a questionmark for me. Sometimes I think, whoa I must be that's the only explanation! Other times I think, maybe I'm just overthinking this.

This morning I tried a little ritual in the bathroom to see if I could get some help in the matter. I think it worked because so far today I haven't felt as if I were feeling someone's else's stuff, except that like, I have felt sick. 

If I knew someone else was sick, then I would wonder, but no one (that I know of) is. So I'm the sick one, I think. The heartache thing I was feeling the other day that I mentioned in here, I still have. I wonder what that is. I hope it's not my, or someone else's heart! I mean, why would my heart be hurting? 

A good question really. So, I will be going to the doctor if this persists. Despite my young age, who knows? I'm not going to really freak out or anything, because, whatever it is, it's mild. 

I have a fabulous collection of lavender at my desk from Maureen. It smells real nice. I'm gonna have lots I can do with them too, yay! Love fresh herbs and such.

"event","I have been pondering this feeling thigns that aren't coming from me thing, and I am kinda wondering if I am an empath. I was thinking about it and there are even other times that this is true.

And last night I was able to not have the excited feeling once I was away from work. It's definitely coming from someone else. I have been fighting against it today. I need to not feel it. I should look for something to shut it off!

I emailed e-books to myself for reading at work today. I have a bunch of good ones I can read, that's for sure.

I just tried imagining I have a barrier for myself. It feels like it might be working. I had this weird feeling in my heart earlier. It was like heartburn kinda, a little ache in my heart. 

It's definitely love coming from Diane and Dustin. I think I may be an empath. Other examples of me feeling things from others, is like the other day in the car. I started crying. Why you ask? I don't know i just felt the loss of a loved one though I haven't lost anyone. It was strange. I'm not a crier. Sure, the music from Sora was on but that shouldn't do it because it usually makes me happy. I was driving at the time so it could have come from another person driving near me.

Sometimes when I'm in a meeting and there's tension between other people, I feel it. Or like when someone is really upset, I get upset, even if I'm not involved. I think it is becoming stronger now. 

Maybe by accepting and bringing my long-hidden beliefs out in the open I have somehow also opened myself up too. I know I used to keep myself protected from others, maybe that was a defense that I picked naturally to protect against feeling everything from others. It's kinda like when you have the ability to read minds, you end up really overwhelmed because feeling what others feel is hard. Maybe, I dunno.

At any rate, it's about time for a walk and I'm gonna go to the restroom before walk time! Mhmm."

But I dont know if I mentioned this yesterday. I have this weird excited feeling and I can't get rid of it. I'm not excited about anything, but I feel excited. It's frustrating lol. Am I going insane?

You know what's yummy, cheap gum. Yeah I'm chewing some apple dubble bubble right now. And you know what's totally hilarious? Trying to arrange a Star Wars Stormtrooper action figure in the gayest pose possible. And making funny jokes that have a puase just before the punchline. Such as: ""I always knew I could count on Dustin... to gay it up."" Lolol.

I'm silly, but really what else should I do at times like this? I feel excited, wich means I feel wired, which means gum is a good idea, and I am practically bouncing in my seat or something! Sheesh.

So I can't remember either whether I mentioned that my boss is being sent back to a store as a salesman. Yeah, a nice f-you to him for 20 years of service. *kisses* But yeah, superbly not awesome.

And today I met with they guy who will become my boss, and he knows nothing about what we do right? So he's looking for the easy solutions, and sends me on this tedious project. Well, I was working on it, and Bob said not to. Well, who do I listen to, my soon-to-be boss or my real one? 

Besides the fact that I agree with my boss, this whole thing puts me in an awkward position. Blahhhhhhhh work sucks. 

Ok I need a plan so that I can make both of them happy. How about I tell the soon-to-be that I am working with the current one to ""update"" what we currently have. I will have to explain to him that there are no quick and easy guides to this, and that even when we directly ask regulators we don't get answers. Which is why the CA guide book is so amazingly useful. If only the other states did that. It would be so much easier.

Alright, that's a good plan.

Diane gave me a good plan with the excited feeling too. I'll have to investigate what I want to do about it. 

I'm going grocery shopping tonight, which may or may not be awesome. Here's hoping for awesome. I need to wear sensible shoes.."

Maybe it's someone else's feeling that is leaking out of them and i'm picking it up. Hmm that is an interesting theory.

At any rate, it is weird. People around me have been sick so I am hoping hoping hoping that I don't get sick. Being sick is yucky!

So, last night Diane gave me some charka work to do to try out. It was a little weird for me but I think I did ok at it. I'm just not sure what, if any, effect it had.

One thing that was interesting was that it didn't really go the way it was described. Well, instead of colored balls, I had crazy little colored flames. They were cool looking. I kinda want to draw them or something. But yeah, an experiment. 

I also did a grounding exercise I learned from a book. That one felt liek a structured daydream. Kinda weird. 

It seems like now that I have become aware I have been looking everywhere, straining to see and connect. I think I am being too forceful and I need to let it come to me, like it was before. I am going to try the ball thing a different way tonight to test that thought out. I think it might have a stronger effect on me and feel like more of a good execerise this way.

I am going to go over to the library tonight and pick up a book that I have been waiting for! It's very exciting because I want to be able to read as mch as possible, and I have been waiting a week for this one so it will be nice to finally have it.

I also need to work on Nancy's drawing. I keep putting it off and I shouldn't because she needs it to be done soon! Tonight, instead of playing all night I am going to get that sutff situated first and depending on my mood I might even start the initial drawing. I should also call her tonight. That would be a good idea. 

After that I don't think I have any more unfinished projects for other people! Just in time for Christmas when I'm going to need to make bunches of them, lol! Well, at least I think I should make them becuase I am too poor to buy lots of stuff. 

I need to remember to get Kirk's birthday present too. Fallout 3 for the 360. He's gonna love it!

In fact this one does even more because I used things I have had a long time in it as well. I used a picture that I had used to decorate my college dorm room freshman year. It was cool because it's a sphere with the directions (N, E, S, W and up, down, center). And I used a snowy picture that I had used for a little bit of writing I did about my ski coach who died. He is one of those people who help you to realize that you should do what is right for you, not for others. He would support what I am now doing, and in a way he will be now. I also used a picture of a goddess (i know right?) that I found among all the cards I have kept from other people over the years. I think it was a birthday present or something in there and it was so pretty that I kept it. Little did I know at the time lol. I thought it was really cool that I could re-use things that have been with me all this time. 

It's like I am mirroring myself in my book. I am putting what I have always known into the right context finally. In my book I am doing in the physical world what is happening to me in my mind and spirit. Man, that's cool. I didn't think of that until now but I really feel that it is true.

I am still pondering what it means for me and Diane to both be, well, witches. I mean, I'm not yet ready and stuff, but I guess that's the easiest way to describe it. It seems like there's some big reason for it that I don't know yet. Even if there weren't it's already great becasue we can share with each other. 

What I was thinking of was the twin goddesses. Like we are linked like them, but facing out different directions. I think I need to do some art about that, after reading some more about them today. 

I am not sure what coven group that is preexisting I want to contact. In some ways I would really like to be in a new one that is just getting going, but also I need people who are experienced because I know hardly anything in comparison. Maybe I will wait for Yule, and see if there is an open gathering I can attend. Maybe I'll bring Diane with me too. I definitely believe that a coven is right for me, because I really want to grow and learn, the things I have done and learned, which is just barely anything, have already created such a material change in me. It really is amazing you know?

When I came in to work, I told Dustin about my awesome I'm a rocker dream, because it rocked, right? Ok then Diane's like I had an awesome dream too, and said she keeps a dream diary. So then I think, hey wait a minute... But I don't say anything right? Because you know it's hard to talk about and stuff. 

Well, later on she and I are emailing because we are gonna do a girls night, and she mentions that she meditates too. Then I'm really thinking... whoa man, whoa. Ok, so then when I reply I ask her is she's a mystic. Much easier to ask that than say, hey are you a witch? 

Alright so she replies right, that she's never called herself that but that she has studied witchcraft and practices wicca but not as much as she used because she has a hard time sticking to it. OK, so the powers that be, as I have not come to a conclusion on my own personal definition of the sacred, have clearly done this on purpose. The timing is like... spot on. 

It's soo cool! It's like, the craziest awesome thing ever. I mean, I already know her and stuff so like, this is neat huh. I have a witch friend, lol and I didn't know it before. Yay for that.

Anyways, so yeah you could say that I have already seen intervention and a HUGE Gigantic sign that this is the right thing for me. Very exciting! I need to get to work huh! Yup. 

I need to think about whether I share with her about my upcoming ritual I'm doing Saturday morning. Hmmm. I probably should huh. Anyways, It's pretty much lunchtime and I have gots to pee so imma do that first.

"event","I have decided that I should keep a dream journal. So, I will now have 2 books for myself to store information. My Dream Journal and my other book which I have not figured a name for yet.

Last night and yesterday I did some more good reading and learning and thinking. I really like the search for the sacred that was described by the witch who wrote the book I am reading. It's neat the way she describes it. She beleives that the sacred is everywhere, and that this indescribable force needs a face in order to be easier for humans to see and worship. She states that all the deaities that are worshipped are ""faces"" which can ber freely chosen from to find the aspects of teh sacred which apply to you specifically, and that witches can worship any number of gods. 

So, essentially for me I just need to find the ones I like! Of course, I also need to read and study and practice. But you know what, it's not work, it's like I'm so drawn to it. Weird because normally I have a detachment from religion and worship. Like a part of me couldn't believe. It seems like it's either disappearing now, or it was just waiting for me to find the way!

At first I thought I should be very secretive about my choice, but this morning after dreaming of my friend Shelby I felt like I should tell some people. Maybe I am supposed to share it. I will consider carefully who I share with and things, but I think maybe I should now.

My dreams are having an influence on my thoughts with this very strongly. I wake up in the morning and it's like my mind has worked out another part of the puzzle for me. 

Oh yeah, dream journal too. I need to keep track of the last two nights dreams. Lets see, Wednesday night I had dreams I can't clearly remember but they were of witchcraft and being a witch. When I went to sleep I for the first time of the day I really started to feel that Wicca is right for me. Then in the morning it was totally concrete.

Last night I dreamt of my friend Shelby, and we were around party people. Some of them were inhaling ""powdered alcohol"" that was white like cocaine. We were with cheerleaders and there were lots of people, like at a pep rally or something. Something I have never done. In the dream I felt like I was ""cool"" and belonged to the ""in"" crowd. I know for myself I have had a lot of confidence issues in the past. Maybe this is a sign that I don't need to worry about that, and to be confident in myself. In the dream everyone else was doing all these things to be cool, like the weird alcohol drug thing, and I was content saying no because I felt like I was above that or something. Like I was confident in myself and didn't need to succumb to such a bad thing like that just to fit in with people. 

Welp, I think I am going to get back to my studies now! 

Bless this day!"

"event","So, as anyone who reads my journal knows (if there is anyone) I have been feelign a bit of a crisis of self lately. I struggle with my ability to be kind to others and respect them as they do me. I tend to have emotions under the surface that are hard to control. 

I feel like it is an inner discontent or something. At times it can be frustrating, other times it is gone. In relation to that, for all of my life I have been searching for a belief structure that fits for me. Something I identify personally with.

I have always felt that there is a greater power, never had a doubt about that. I just haven't found the words to describe it, the ideas which contain it, so to speak. It's hard to describe.

I have also felt that I have power, or am connected to the greater power out there. This feeling at some times is very strong for me. Usually it coincides with natural forces around me, like a big storm, a forest fire, a quiet snowfall, that sort of thing. Or how I feel when I am in the middle of a forest. I have felt connected to nature, and I feel more myself when I am in it. 

I in fact want to live in the woods. I have always wanted to. I used to think it would be a good thing in some ways for the apocalypse to happen and for me to be able to freely leave cities and live in the woods, as my family did before me.

In my search for a group/religion which suited me I found none. I am drawn to supernatural movies, TV shows and books as well, because the themes relate more closely in some ways and I feel like they help me to find the answer.

About a year ago (I think) I had a sort of strange experience, which I didn't talk to anyone about. I would be driving or something and I would feel like I could sense the future, like I have magical powers that I can use. Like my mind is connected to the outside world and can control it. Since then I have been willing my mind to do try to do things like that. I don't know for certain that there has been any changes or effect, and sometimes I would feel that I was just being silly for thinking that, but a part of me has always strongly beleived it.

I used to feel reserved and not confident enough to share this information because I didn't think anyone would 1: believe me and 2: share my feelings about it. Last week I was talking in my fansub forum ""thoughful section"" about whether I believe in witchcraft, which I said I do, and one of the people there said I should look into Wicca. 

I have been researching this a currently have a book about covens at my house. I have 2 other research books on hold with the library. From what I have read, I really feel I may have foudn what I am looking for.

This weekend I plan to commmit myself to learning. There is a ritual for it that I am going to do in a natural place. Last night I kept thinking over where I should do it, and this morning I knew where. It's funny how that works, you know? I think early Saturday morning I will head to my special woods spot and prepare myself to be commited to learning.

I think to begin I need to be on my own just so that I can figure out what type of coven I want. From what I was reading, I think I want a family. I think that it would be wonderful to have a close-knit group to share and be shared with. I had this group in high school from my youth group called Girls Group, and we met each Wednesday and we all shared from our souls about things that have happened and we helped each other. We were so close because of it, like sisters. I didn't have much to share there, at the time my life was simple and I was also afraid sometimes to share. But when I did share it was very good. 

The one thing about a coven for me will be to remember to drop my barrier. In order to do so though I will need to have perfect trust for the others. In some ways I feel that I need to learn this and that being in a coven is a really good way to learn this and at the same time I need to have that before I join a coven. So badly I need to have a way to share, a place to share, people to share with. I have kept all my thoughts on the spirit and everything about my beliefs from others, I think that it feels like I have been hiding who I am, even from myself.

The very idea of being able to truly do this is exciting. At first, when reading about Wicca I was skeptical and not sure if it was right. Right now I feel the opposite. Amazing what sleeping does to you. 

That was one of the things that clicked in me too! The fact that I beleive my dreams matter and that soetimes I predict things and that I know something from a dream means something else. This is something that is believed in Wicca too! There are other examples as well, most of all the connection to nature.

I will keep reading more and keep my journal updated on this, because it might be helpful to me later! I plan to make a specific hand written copy of what I will be doing, and I am going to make it a significant thing for myself so that later it can be revisited and I can learn more.

Walk time! Yay for life ^^"

"event","I have these crackers which I eat every day. I could eat like 3 packages really, they are that good. So crispy and slightly buttery, with salt on the outside and peanut butter on the inside. Yum!

Right now I have 2 left in the package of 6 that I brought. I am trying to save them, but it's hard because they are just sooo good^^ Opps I just spilled my oatmeal lol. I was trying to take a small bite to test the warmness but I failed, lol. My oatmeal is good, but you know it just doesn't compare to the yumminess of the crackers.

I came up with a brilliant plan to learn my japanese. I have 5 hiragana cards up next to my monitor all day, and I learn them all day while I work! And I work on drawing them too in order to learn to write in hiragana, and also to help with remembering what they are. I am a visual/doing learner, so that should work great! 

Once I am done with the hiragana I can start Kanji! It will be harder and easier at the same time I think. At least with kanji they are complete words or close to it so that it is easier to figure out how to communicate you know?

Eventually I will need to practice speaking too. I have heard there are people around here who can help me, so I will have to check into it and see. That would be really good if I could practice speaking with someone in order to complete my understanding. 

If I really want to be fluent I will need to go to Japan. Gee, bummer, I'll have to go visit a country, would that just be... ok I can't pretend anymore. That would be so awesome. Super-fun exciting adventure in Japan yay! Mhmm. 

Bleh there is work in my email inbox. I guess i'll just have to get to work again. Oh well, there's always more free time later though! Jaane^^"

"event","Blehm it's Monday once again. I feel bad because this morning I acidentally got Ryan up an hour early because of daylight savings time. Whoops ;; One thing I totally hate...to my core, is when Ryan works before me. He wakes me up over and over again while he is getting ready and ruins the time I could have slept during, and then makes me extra groggy because of it when I do get up. Grr.

And this morning it was 2 hours of that crap instead of just one! Double grrr!

Today I brought my japanese flashcards and writing Hiragana book so that I can get some studying in. I am pretty much done with my part of the project I had been working on so my workload is light now. Good thing because I was feeling kinda overwhelmed by it I tell you!

I had a fun weekend for the most part, except Ryan and I had a fight on Saturday morning. It sucked. We went to Home Depot to get the rest of the paint stuff we needed for our projects, and then on the way home I suggested that we work on the file cabinet, if he wanted to. 

He tells me he doesn't want to, and I say ok. Then he keeps pressing me to get me to admit that it's important to me. Which it is, but not more important than having a nice day with him. Well, then there was a big blow up between us about it. Basically I think he needs me to be the bad guy so that he doesn't make himself feel guilty about it. When I suggest soemthing that isn't fun, clearly it's something I htink really needs to be done, right? 

Well, I guess he didn't see that, or was just trying to get me to be forceful about it so that he could be the victim. It's just hard for him to see that I am being upfront, transparent about things. If I weren't then it might be easier for him to deal with it. The way that I am I guess causes him to torture himself over it. It's just silly because the whole thing could have easily been avoided. 

At any rate, after the drama subsided we were able to get a lot of work done on it this weekend. 

I also got to level my Beastmaster. You know, I always forget how much I love that job. And then, I remember! <333333 Beastmaster. Mhmm. Then last night we had the most pointless/fail salvage attempt ever. I say attempt because we really had zero sucess in there. We wiped several times and everything. Yuck. But, meh. Another run tonight, so hopefully it will be sucessful.

I think I will also do a quick painting layer on the handles of the file cabinet and then level my Beastmaster some more. Maybe some anime too, we'll see. Kinda too much to get it all done."

"event","Oh my, it's really close now and I'm not totally ready yet! Eeep. Ryan needs his wand finished, I need an old-fashioned broom, and we've got to get his beard figured out! Shoot, lol. 

On top of that, I have my signature competition to get done too. Too much to do, and none of it can be done at work! Bleck. I don't want to go buy a broom but I sortof have to if I want my costume to be recognizable to others without Ryan there to complement me. 

Looks like lunchtime will be costume finishing time for me. I am going to go to Linen's N Things because they are going out of business and I have a $10 gift card to thier store! That way if they have an old-style broom I can get it! I might paint the handle purple, lol, if I have time.

After work tonight then I will take a shower, blow dry my hair, finish Ryan's wand, and then work on my signature. Mhmm. Jeez, a lot to do huh. Then at 8 its time for the Haunted House! I'll need to bring 4 cans of food and $5. 

Ok, I feel a little better now that I talked it out on here. That does seem to help a lot most of time! Yay for journals! I don't even know if anyone else reads it but it's nice to have. One day I can look back at everything I wrote if I want!

I might start keeping track of my migraines on here too. Might be good to have it in a non-losable form, plus if I do it at work I will be able to have time to do it so I don't end up not doing it anymore.

Hmm, I'll have to think on that. It's about times I worked on some more articles I think."

"event","Except for at work. But jeez, seems like every night I have something going on. Like last night, I totally played kickball. I didn't really want to go but people asked me and I said yes so then I had to. But it was super fun so I'm really glad I did. 

We lost by one point but we played well and it was a good game so that's ok. I wasn't a bad player either! I could kick the ball just right and get onto first base. Except the first kick I gave the ball too much air so it was caught, and another time they hit me with the bal when I was running to first! Gah. But it was totally fun, lol. And I got hit one time when I was trying to get the peson out at home. I was the catcher, which for most of the time meant I had nothing to do. Other times though it meant I was trying hard to keep people from scoring. Sadly they did anyways. Because I didn't have the ball to tag them! Dang.

Tonight my Dad is coming over and we are going to attach the wooden frames to Ryan's dresser and probably eat some pizza. It will be good to see him! It's been a whole month because they haven't come down and I haven't come up. 

Gosh still nothing to do here at work. Bummer. Except the article writing. I suppose I should just start working on it. I really like my morning of checking blogs, updating journal, updating my blog, checking fansub forums. Yep, it's pretty crazy how much free time I have. Really, I could be without a job right now because I just have too much time. Luckily most of my work thinks that I am needed I guess. Who knows though. Sometimes I think I would like to just take over for Bob when he retires and be the Director. That would be really cool. 

I hope to be able to work on the Halloween signature contest project tonight. After my Dad leaves I suppose. It would be good because I think it's going to look really cool when I get done! One thing that sucks is that I don't really have ideas for the background. Oooh that's something fun I can do! Look up pics for the background from animes. Just need some really good Halloweeny looking stuff. Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok anyone? Mhmm. That and maybe some others. That one first, I remember some really cool shots in the beginning of it. Maybe vampire knight too! Yay.

Ok time to get to it! I will at least allow myself until walk time for fun stuff. Yay!"

So to day was the first day back at work for my co-worker who had been gone on maternity leave, but she had to move to a different department, so we don't get to hang out anymore! Bummer huh. Yep. But I think she will enjoy her job more in the other department than she did here, so it's also a good thing.

I am getting really excited for Halloween! Mhmm. Oh, but I need to talk to Bob about taking off the Friday after Thanksgiving. I wonder what he thinks about that. I better ask him today, no time like the present! Mhmm. 

I also need to go get my ballot today. Yeah because otherwise I might forget again and slack off. That would suck because every vote totally counts this year! Hmm I'm also going to need to read up on all of the vote stuff, like what I should vote for and what I shouldn't.

SO at work we are going to have a costume contest, cubile decoration contest, and candy parade! Sounds super fun. Halloween is gong to be fabulous!

Today is 2 of my friends' birthdays, Mikey and Diane. Happt Brithday to both of them! Yay!~"

"event","Well, not really. I'm actually quite busy, and that is why I have not made a post yet today. I may have also forgotten on Friday, I am not sure now. 

I have been writing up a storm of articles for work, and doing my normal work, and whatnot surfing and guessing riddles and vehicles and anime from pictures and such. Busy time, considering I have no work you'd think I would be bored but lately I'm super busy and the time flies by!

Yay for that. I am also enjoying my non-work time as I have been doing a ton of things. This weekend I carved pumpkins, they are sooo cute^^ and I painted a dresser, which turned out awesome, and I built things for habitat for humanity, and I visited a corn maze! Shew.

Tonight I am going to spend time on ffxi, again, like last night, and it's cool because I never had time before and now that I do I am totally soaking it up! Mhmm. Becuase I figure I wont have time forever so I should do what I want to now.

Money-wise I'm poor but I keep somehow being able to scrape by, so lets just hope that continues! I keep getting checks in the mail too, that helps lol. Like the check I got for my contacts from my insurance and the one I got from my mom for some investment thing when I was a kid on my college fund. Yay for checks in the mail, so awesome!

Anyways, I suppose I should go so that I can go home for the day and all that! Peace out homies! Haha."

That would be good, because I have alreayd done everything else I can. Well, except some actual work, and writing articles. But it's hard to write a ton of articles you know? And actual work is super mega boring.

I'm a whiner huh, lol. Well, at any rate, I am going to spend some time working on articles and website audits today to pass the time.

Tonight I am going to go work out at the gym until 6 and then eat dinner. Then I will work on my book stuff. If I get it done tonight then I won't have to work on it again for a while! That would be great. 

Then, I will be free to do as I wish, mhmm."

"event","As I slowly come down from my yoga high (I <3 Mondays, weiiird), I write this post. I had a nice productive weekend but was plagued by a migraine on Sunday, and a little on Saturday. Mostly Sunday. in fact, I was nearly delirious when I was trying to fall asleep, and I decided the best way to fal asleep would be to balance my water bottle on my forehead and try to relax. It actually worked too though, lol. Weirdly enough.

I was annoyed at my boyfriend though because he kept cuddling up so close I had barely any room on the bed. Same with this morning, when I really really really didn't want to get up, lol. 

For this week, I have really only one imperative task, and that is to finish the changes to my book and email and mail it to Sean, and myself. Sean is very optimistic about the book, I wonder if he is right, or if it will just be something to put on my resume.

The other non-imperative tasks I have for myself are starting Nancy's drawing and finishing up Halloween costumes. I finished Ryan's last night, and it is so awesome! Perfect. Such a great looking costume, yay. Mine is also nearly finished, but not quite yet.

I have some pumpkin pie waiting for me here at my desk, but I am still feeling a little sick from yoga. For some reason today it made me feel a bit ill. My belly is kinda tender now. I wanna go lay down in bed and rest, but I still have 3 hour left of work!  Bleck. Welp, here's to wasting another three hours here..."

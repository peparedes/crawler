"event","So here i am carrying on a conversation with myself and i realize that my feet are completely naked. and i mean COMPLETELY exposed to the world. My carpet, which is actually my doggy named Scruffy, thinks they should put some clothes on. and i can see why, because they do get rather frisky. my left foot is rather fond of hollys right foot and also every other right foot that exists on the planet. i hate to admit it, but my left foot's a whore. it's been knocked up five times already, so now i have 5 little toes to take care of! i should really think about getting it some protection. i cant afford to have a 6th or 7th toe. it's really gotten out of hand. maybe if i beat it sensless it would learn to contain itself.

*itches eyebrow*

and I think scruffy gave me fleas. Stupid dog! *kicks carpet* OW! What're you made of Scruffy?! Concrete?! Jebus....


Would you like to buy my dog?"

"event","Ah yes...Tis Happy Tuesday. You know, the day that follows Happy Monday! Life is making it up to me after putting me through misery last week. It's been SO good to me since Thursday. 

Lets see, Thursday I got a job! YES! I wash dishes and bus tables at the Horton Inn. I like it even though I get payed only a little over $5. I get to work with Kari...who actually was the one who told me there was and opening! So thank you Kari, I love you. MUWAH! hehe. Friday was my first night working, and Kari helped ""train"" me. ""No, don't pee in that!"" Ha! Just kidding. The only downer to the job is that Sam Ritchie works there. ICK! I hate him. Ha! I punched him last year! Yeah thats right! I punched the bastard! Anyway...moving on now.

So Saturday I went to school for art team. Now most kids don't like being at school on saturdays but I LOVE it! I love the people in it with me, that's probably why. I usually dont accomplish much because we always end up ordering pizza and talking about/finding the pervey parts in disney movies. If not that, then we're doing background checks on people. GOOD TIMES!

Sunday sucked! I can't believe I've been neglecting this journal thing. I can just babble about anything and not worry about if im annoying anyone! Terrrr!

Monday was fun. I dont know why. I was just in a good mood and happy to see my friends. I didn't even care that I failed my spanish test! It was pathetic, the only reason I failed is because I did bad on the listening section and missed accent marks and spelled chit wrong. Mi corazon es muy verde en unas casa blancas. See?! I speak spanish! :D

Today was the same as monday, maybe a little less happy. I must say, I LOVE my creative writing class. The only thing that pisses me off is that my teacher keeps telling me to cut out a ton of words in my poems. Durr...I kinda need those words otherwise I sound like a foreigner speaking poor english! SHEESH! She needs to get her act together. lol.

I think I should mention Christy in here too. I just started talking to her, but she's a blast! And it's freaky, cuz we watch the same shows (when I do happen to watch tv), both our middle names are Marie, we BOTH dated Andrew, and her birthday is exactly a month before mine. It's as freaky as me, holly, and jala all liking the same guys!

Jalaine should marry Dan
I should marry that Shannon guy
Rachel should marry...hmmm...she should marry...well...Okay, the point was I have a lot in common with the people I socialize with!

Anyway, I think I'm going to shush now. And oh look! I have IMs! YAY! I'm 30 friends away from being popular!"

"event","Ah yes, I've made it through yet another day. It was both horrible and good...funny eh?

I don't know how the heck I'm suppose to make constructions on the computer. My teacher won't help me so I asked Tyler if he could help me. Such a kind little Chicken Killer; he's helping me out tomorrow after school! YAY! Smartness. After that I get to help Jessi with her project. 

Hmmm...what else?

Holly's cat went missing:( *pout* FELINE RUN HOME! HOME!

I guess I have all these things to say, yet can't put them into words. Well isn't that a kick in the rear.

I'll get back to you...

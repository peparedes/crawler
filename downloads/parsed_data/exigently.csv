"event","Not a proper post, just some more lyrics. Was driving home and this came up on the iPod; didn't know I had it but the lyrics were just so surreal I had to post them.
<blockquote><em>She drove a big ol' Lincoln with suicide doors
And a sewing machine in the back
And a light bulb that looked like an alligator egg
Was mounted up front on the hood

And she had an Easter bonnet that had been signed by Tennessee Ernie Ford
And she always had sawdust in her hair
And she cut two holes in the back of her dress
and she had these scapular wings
That were covered with feathers and electrical tape
And when she got good and drunk
She would sing about Elkheart, Indiana
Where the wind is strong and folks mind their own business

And she had at least a hundred old baseballs that she'd taken from kids
And she collected bones of all kinds
And she lived in a trailer under a bridge
And she made her own whiskey and gave cigarettes to kids
And she'd been struck by lightning seven or eight times
And she hated the mention of rain

And she made up her own language
And she wore rubber boots
And she could fix anything with string
And her lips were like cherries
And she was stronger than any man
And she smelled like gasoline and Rootbeer Fizz
And she put mud on a bee sting I got at the creek
And she gave me my very first kiss
And she gave me my very first kiss

Talking 'bout my little Kathleen
She's just a fine young thing
Someday she'll wear my ring
My little Kathleen </em></blockquote>PS: no, I don't think I know anybody called Kathleen :)"

"event","Feel like posting some more lyrics. This song was in my head a lot nearly four years ago now, during the summer of 2005, and it popped in again recently, not sure why.
<em><blockquote>When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep 
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face 
When you lose something you can't replace 
When you love someone but it goes to waste 
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home 
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below 
When you're too in love to let it go 
But if you never try you'll never know 
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home 
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you 

Tears stream, down on your face 
When you lose something you cannot replace 
Tears stream down your face and I...

Tears stream, down on your face 
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes 
Tears stream down your face and I...

Lights will guide you home 
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you.</blockquote></em>"

"event","Time for a post, and time also for some lyrics, because this song has been coming in and out of my head for the past while. I can't actually get hold of it for love or (reasonable) money &mdash; sure, a CD containing it is available from Amazon UK for GBP 40, and I can't even find a downloadable version of the original. I did manage to find a cover version by some other band which sounds mostly right.

Anyway, the original is called <em>Keeping The Dream Alive</em> by a German band called <em>M&uuml;nchener Freiheit</em>. Maybe that's why it's hard to get hold of.

One of the good things about the song is the music that goes with it, so posting the lyrics doesn't really reproduce that. I also observe that the second half of the lyrics is a bit crappy, but there's not much we can do about that.

Before the lyrics: happy 2009 to all of my readers (both of you :) ) &hellip; I'm hoping for a better year for all concerned. (that wasn't necessarily a value judgement; there's always room for improvement)
<em><blockquote>Tonight the rain is falling 
Full of memories of people and places 
And while the past is calling 
In my fantasy I remember their faces 

The hopes we had were much too high 
Way out of reach but we have to try 
The game will never be over 
Because we're keeping the dream alive 

I hear myself recalling 
Things you said to me 
The night it all started 
And still the rain is falling 
Makes me feel the way 
I felt when we parted 

The hopes we had were much too high 
Way out of reach but we have to try 
No need to hide no need to run 
'Cause all the answers come one by one 
The game will never be over 
Because we're keeping the dream alive 

I need you 
I love you 

The game will never be over

"event","it's been a while since I posted (again&hellip;) &mdash; but thanks to <lj user=""mollydot""/> for poking me to see if I was still about.

not quite sure what to write and still stay within the intended parameters of this LJ, but suffice to say that I've had plenty of distractions from posting over the last while. In fact, if I was to <em>avoid</em> listing fairly-lame excuses for not having posted for a while, then there'd be nothing to post at all.

life is reasonably good right now &mdash; I'll give it a 6.7 out of 10, which is more positive than negative. Among the (probably) good things is that I've recently moved house (a big time sink in itself; call that the primary excuse). I've signed my life and income away for the next 34 years and hence will be sinking most of my spare income, and then some, into a mortgage, for the foreseeable future, and beyond. However, that said, I'm now sitting in my own new shiny place on a sofa that I actually own, that is actually comfortable &mdash; so I'm pretty pleased about all that. 

so like I said, this acquiring property and moving stuff lark (how on earth can any human being acquire so much <em>stuff</em> in a relatively short space of time? We're born with nothing and yet &mdash; somehow &mdash; acquire piles of, well, junk. Last time I moved (about four years ago) I think all my stuff was moved in two car-loads, give or take, and this time it must have taken at least 20. WTF!!??) (and all that goes with it) has taken pretty-much all of my free time for the last four months or so. Still sitting surrounded by boxes and mounds and heaps and piles of books, but that should reduce over time.

I've been avoiding buying any new books for a good few months now, since I realised I'd been buying them at a relatively steady rate, and reading them at a much slower rate, and also acquiring a few by other means. So it's time to read them. Oh, and get a bookshelf to actually put them on.

aside from the moving front, life's been relatively flat really &mdash; some family events (of the sadder rather than the happy variety) happened recently &mdash; and I'm also very happy to have a small core of pretty good friends, without whom I really don't think I could live. Still, sometimes, when I turn the lights out at night, I realise that I'm alone. Sometimes I'm relatively comfortable with the idea that that may be the way things are to be for the rest of my life, and other times I wish that it weren't the case; I tend to oscillate between those two extremes &mdash; there are certainly positives and negatives to both of those positions.

work is, well, it's work. I was pretty pissed off with it a few months ago, but that's improved; it's certainly a whole lot better than the last job, where many mornings I just so really didn't want to go in to work &mdash; right now it's enjoyable enough of the time to make it good, on balance. I don't think I'll stay there forever, of course &mdash; maybe another two years.

<em>[aside: why on earth can't the LJ spell checker actually work in the English language? I was about to not have this brief rant after I saw a combo box at the bottom of the page where you can select ""English (UK)"" (not that I'm in the UK, mind you) as the language, but it still flags basic words like ""realise"" as spelling mistakes and suggests alternatives from some dialect of English as used in another country entirely. (OK, end rant)]</em>"

"event","Just finished watching <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0401383/"">The Diving-Bell And The Butterfly</a> (en Fran&ccedil;ais, c'est <em>Le scaphandre et le papillon</em>) and yesterday finished the book upon which it's based.

I found the film very well made &mdash; and quite a lot more moving than the book, for some reason. Like some things in life, it's another reminder of just how lucky must of us are. There are so many adversities in life, some large, some small, yet thankfully, from my own point of view at least, none of these are possibly as great an adversity as that which Jean-Dominique Bauby faced in his story. You can see (in the film especially) how his situation affects also those who are close to him as well as he himself, and there are several reminders of some of the different aspects of the human condition. I suppose I'm thinking about how random life seems sometimes; how we quest towards and want some things for our selves and for others, yet how often when good things do happen, it not only sometimes seems like pure luck that they happen at all, but they're also so very fragile and can be whipped away from us in an instant. Scary.

I know I'm rambling here, but not to worry; that's partly what this forum is for, I suppose."

"event","Got home from work today, and was in a bit of a low place, feeling pretty blue, and there was an envelope in my mailbox addressed to me.

This envelope contained a CD, sent by a friend of mine who is overseas, and we'd talked about the film whose soundtrack is on the CD a couple of months ago, so it was an extraordinarily good choice.

The CD is the soundtrack for the film <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0467406/"">Juno</a>. I even wrote a <a href=""http://exigently.livejournal.com/8418.html"">posting</a> at the time that I went to see the film. I liked the music from the film so much at the time that I went out and got hold of the eponymous album by the Moldy Peaches (because they played the last track in the film). I can even forgive that band for having a spelling mistake in their name :)

Suffice to say, anyway, that this unexpected gift turned my mood right around, and, in an odd away, helped me look out a little from my own place where I'd been thinking largely about myself and my own feelings, to realise that there are (many) other people out there &mdash; and it's so easy to have an effect on others, whether we mean to or not, as a side effect of what we do/say &mdash; or even don't do or say either."

Not a high budget film, but that's not the point. Nice too to see Dublin (and not just the shiny bits, at all) as a location &mdash; but the story is just &hellip; amazing. Enough moments of tension to keep your attention, plenty of emotion, absolutely <em>zero</em> cheese, excellent music (which is 40% of the point of the film &mdash; or, at least, the glue that holds it together).

Most importantly though, it contains a story. A real could-happen-in-real-life story, that's entirely plausible and is also like a summary of one of the most important parts of the human condition. It contains happy and sad, hopeful and tragic, what-if, if-only and more. I have to admit I burst into tears as it ended &mdash; alright, call me pathetic, or something, if you want."

You've made it now

Falling slowly, eyes that know me
And I can't go back

And I'm painted black

You have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you won

Quite good so far &mdash; got it because I read somewhere that it was a bit like <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Time-Travelers-Wife-Audrey-Niffenegger/dp/0099464462/"">The Time Traveler's <em>[sic]</em> Wife</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/You-Remind-Me-Dan-Chaon/dp/0345441419/"">You Remind Me Of Me</a> (can't remember which one now, not that it matters, really))

I've had trouble sleeping for the last few weeks, ever since I decided to go ahead and ""just do"" something, which I did recently. I was anxious about that something in the lead-up to it, but that part's over now, however, now it leads on to the next chapter in that something (sorry for being vague, but, well, tough) which is still keeping me awake a little, 'cos I can't stop thinking about it. I'm not often an anxious person, but I'm well capable of it when the need arises, and I suppose anxiety is one of those thing you don't <em>choose</em> to experience or not, it just happens.

It's nothing that should <em>logically</em> keep me awake &hellip; I think &hellip; yet it's been in the back (and front) of my mind for a while. That said though, I'm feeling very alive right now, very happy to be alive. A couple of months ago life was feeling very quiet, as though somebody had pressed the pause button and it was kinda stuck. I was aware that I had to do something &mdash; anything, almost &mdash; to unpress the pause button, and maybe I've just managed to do that, and it feels good &mdash; I feel more powerful and more energetic now. Although I wouldn't mind a good solid night's sleep either :)"

There're also plenty of funny bits, a little general-purpose and/or teenage angst, and some nice music and cinematographic touches.

I reprint the lyrics here shamelessly. Their copyright belongs to Snow Patrol, but hopefully showing them here falls within the definition of fair use. I just wish I could write poetry like this. My favourite songs always seem to be my favourites because of the lyrics, but they have to sound fantastic too.
<em><blockquote>
I find the map and draw a straight line
Over rivers farms and state lines
The distance from A to where you'd be
It's only finger lengths that I see

I touch the place
Where I'd find your face
My fingers in creases
Of distant dark places

I hang my coat up in the first bar
There is no peace that I've found so far
The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in silence

Their words mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me

And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground and I
I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

After I have travelled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted close our eyelids

And dreaming pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weeping
A joy you can't keep in

And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground and I
I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground and I
I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

"event","<lj user=""kshandr""> <a href=""http://kshandr.livejournal.com/157845.html"">posted</a> recently, in continuation of a meme where someone nominates a year, and you write about your life during that year. I asked for a year, and was given 1995&hellip;

<lj-cut text=""so, here goes"">
1995 was a good choice of year because it was a fairly eventful year in my life. I can remember the big events quite well, but a lot of the details are fuzzy in my memory &mdash; not least because much time and many events have passed, so it feels like a century ago. That said, the year started a sequence of events that would set the course of my life for most of the following decade.

I was working at the time in my first job since finishing college. In January of that year, I met somebody who would be a big part of my life for several years after that. It was at a trip to the cinema with a couple of friends, who had asked a couple of other people along, one of whom was the person in question. At the end of the night, my pre-existing friend and I saw this new person to her bus. As we walked away from the bus, I said to my friend: ""just for the record, in case there's any dispute later: I saw her first!""

Anyway, over the next couple of months I saw this new person with increasing frequency, and we spent increasing amounts of time together. She omitted to mention for a while that she had a boyfriend back in the country she was from, and by the time that became apparent, I was well and truly hooked. ""Conveniently"", he fell by the wayside shortly after in any case. This was the beginning of the most serious relationship I had ever had up until that point &mdash; although I suppose I was relatively young at the time (early 20s).

We travelled to many places around Ireland and beyond, both by ourselves and with friends &mdash; to Clare, Wexford, Waterford, Kildare, Antrim, Scotland and probably a few other places, and also around continental Europe by train. She also became acquainted with and accepted into my extended family, and she met with great approval from my circle of friends.

The summer of 1995 was unusually warm, so there plenty of outdoor activities &mdash; hiking in the Wicklow hills, watching the sun rise at the end of an all nighter on the beach, that kind of thing.

REM played a large outdoor concert in Slane castle during the summer, in June or July. That was pretty good.

Anyway, towards the end of the summer, her student visa expired, and so she had to leave the country in September and return to her native country. I remember very clearly taking her to the airport, and wishing that somehow she wouldn't get on that plane. I was heartbroken, and bawled my eyes out when I returned to the car. I was in love.

What came next was a kind of automatic decision; it was pretty-much a no-brainer. Without needing to think about it too much, I decided to follow after her to her country, and so I quit my job, sold my car, and went there exactly sixty days later.

Coincidentally, I did this via the United States, because I had applied for a US green card in the annual lottery, and won a green card. Myself and many of my contemporaries had been applying for the green card lottery for the previous couple of years, just in case. So I went first to the US, to activate my green card, stayed with a friend for a week, and then continued on to my ultimate destination.

I arrived there in mid-November to a totally different climate, thousands of kilometres from my family and friends at the time. We started to live together immediately, although perhaps unfortunately without discussing it much in advance. That said, this phase started off very well, and went on for quite some time. Despite being roasted by what seemed like the excessive temperatures, I got myself a contracting job and started to establish a life. Before the year was out, we'd also travelled a little in this country; although we were living about 400km inland, we travelled to the east and south coasts a couple of times and also deeper inland.

So the year began in an Irish winter, single, and ended not single at all, in a warm southern-hemisphere summer. I suppose you could say I was slowly starting to grow up, or something.

I could elaborate on any detail of my memories of that year, but if I do I'll be writing all night. I remember two moments, both with <lj user=""mollydot""> &mdash; one where she asked what I was going to do after my lady friend left the country, and another time (probably some time in October) where we met for lunch (and sat on the banks of the canal to eat our sandwiches), not long before I left Ireland.
</lj-cut>

&hellip;and if anybody reading this wants a year, pop me a request."

"event","I don't dream much &mdash; or, at least, I don't remember my dreams much &mdash; although a thought that just crossed my mind is whether dreams are like the popular horoscopes you see in free newspapers &mdash; worded in just such a way that almost anybody can extract some kind of apparent meaning from them and then disregard anything that doesn't ""fit"".

Had a few dreams lately with characters in them that don't usually feature in my dreams (not that there's any ""usually"" anyway) &mdash; and they haven't been especially unusual either (unless running late to meet people and cycling through a chain of interconnected restaurants (because it's some kind of short cut) only to find that the last restaurant in the chain has no exit is unusual).

But I wonder am I shrugging off the odd parts of the dreams as just something odd and then concentrating on the bits I want to concentrate on and attaching extra significance to them. It is a bit disappointing sometimes to have a dream that's largely pleasant (odd or otherwise) and then to wake up and realise that it was all ""just a dream"". OK, much better than nightmares, that's for sure.

Life's in a kind of state of flux right now; it feels like a slow reboot and therefore an opportunity of sorts to do lots of good life-related things &mdash; but because it's slow and it's not automatic, it's also necessary to keep the wheels turning and keep things happening so as not to fall into a habit where time passes and nothing much happens and then one day I wake up and there's not much life left. It's something to be lived, that's for sure &mdash; and I have to stop playing Tetris for hours at a time &mdash; that's something that feels like a big waste of time. I used to think you knew when you were playing too much Tetris because you'd have Tetris shapes falling from the sky in your dreams, but these days I find myself playing Tetris in my imagination while at work, or while eating lunch, or even in the middle of conversations with people. Stop!"

"event","I seem to do this every couple of months &mdash; start a post by muttering about how it's been ages since the last post with any real content, and how this is supposed to be the start of a new habit of posting semi-regularly. I was about to say how I wasn't planning to start this one that way, but it seems as though I've just done exactly that&hellip;

What's new? Not sure what to call the last checkpoint so instead of trying to fill in all the gaps (that's not my purpose anyway) I'll just ramble a little.

I'm thoroughly fed up with my current job, not least because of the non-zero idiot coefficient, but also because of the working arrangements which I find intrusive and restrictive of a normal life. They're barely legal (in terms of working hours) but that still allows scope for the occasional 84-hour working week. Another side effect of the way this place works is that the majority of my time is spent supporting production systems, not creating them, which isn't what I want to spend my life doing. The net result of this is that I attempt to spend as little of my time as possible at work, and the bits where I manage to avoid doing any work are an incredibly boring idle-race to the end of the working day.

So I'm looking for a new job &mdash; but slowly, since it's worthwhile getting it right this time. I have applied for a number of positions with what is probably my dream employer, but they're in a different country and it sounds like they're not too keen to arrange visas and so on in the near future. I've also applied to another place which has locations in various parts of the world, and is quite possibly my number two dream employer. They're a very popular employer, for lots of good reasons, so that means they're also quite hard to get into. We'll see what happens &mdash; I've had one introductory interview already.

If that doesn't work out (which I certainly can't depend on) then I need to find another target. One of the benefits of both of the places I mentioned is that it might make relocating to another country a lot more convenient &mdash; either immediately or through an internal transfer later on. Right now that would be a very nice option to have. I'm sort-of waiting to see what comes of the second place. I don't really have a number three dream employer :)

Rather than go on for a while about everything, I'm going to leave this post as a brief ramble about my wish for another (and better) job. I'm going to try to write short more-frequent posts rather than very few or go all out and write one massive post and suddenly stop."

"event","Just done watching <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0372588/"">Team America: World Police</a>. Not a serious movie by any stretch of the imagination, but plenty of satire/lampoon around world politics, terrorism and the like.

Funny thing is that ALL of the characters were puppets &mdash; think Thunderbirds or Stingray &mdash; yet they all played roles that humans could have played. So there were plenty of scenes that would have been relatively unremarkable in a 'normal' movie with human actors that were just so... surreal when played by puppets. 

There was a sex scene, for example &mdash; no excessive detail, and again, it wouldn't be overremarkable if humans were involved &mdash; but&hellip; sex between puppets? All I can say is that I'm happy that the puppets weren't anatomically correct.

Other than that is that some of the attention to detail was quite good &mdash; for example, in the opening scenes, which were set in Paris, all of the background cars were French cars (spotted a Citro&euml;n DS and a Renault 4 anyway) with 'proper' French numberplates (same shape as normal European numberplates, yellow background, with blue EU flag on the left, as you'd expect. Just couldn't quite make out the numbers to make sure it was issued by a valid d&eacute;partement.

Summary: amusing!"

"event","muttered a while ago about having a honking great post to write, but I also wanted to get into the habit of posting semi-regularly. I've realised that those two things are somewhat contradictory, so I'll just write a bit here and there.

I've been kinda distracted from LJ posting a bit the last, er, 2..3 months (with a couple of exceptions). That's 'cos life has been pretty distracting. No big announcement to make or anything, but you could say that I've been enjoying being alive recently.

Today's entry is short 'cos I'm <em>really</em> tired today and just have to get to bed since I was up pretty late last night. The main reason for being up was because of being in communication with somebody in another continent and another timezone, but by several different means, all over IP, mostly simultaneously. Voice transport by Skype, bidirectional video by Yahoo's messenger IM client and chat by a mixture of Yahoo and Adium (ah, technology is great sometimes when you get it to work :) )

Despite the late night I'm incredibly glad to have stayed up and carried on the conversations, for there were several. More than incredibly glad. It was a very emotional conversation at times, and probably also the most emotional I've felt for a long time. In some ways it was a revelation for me because it showed me how strongly I feel inside. Sometimes I think my own feelings are a mystery even to myself and so I get surprised by them when they get let out; possibly I have this habit of being restrained in some ways sometimes, I'm not sure. Having your own feelings let out and overcome you can really give you a tap on the shoulder and give you an insight into yourself.

The biggest part of the reason for being incredibly glad to have stayed up is because the conversations came to a very relieved conclusion. I was kinda drained afterwards, both because of the late hour and because of feeling very emotional &mdash; what had started off with alarm and grief evolved into calm and relief, but all with my heart very close to the surface. Open heart surgery for the emotions? :)

Right now let's just say that I'm happy for many reasons &mdash; happy for recent life, happy for (and with) current people, and happy in anticipation of the medium-term future and some plans that I'm really looking forward to.

Cryptic post? Not too cryptic, I hope. I need to get into the habit of short semi-regular posts so I don't need to try to paint the entire picture and explain every detail. This is primarily a journal of my thoughts, just one that has a small audience too, and I'm conscious of that. If I were writing solely for myself, then I guess LJ wouldn't be the medium for that."

life has got pretty interesting lately; I'm delighted about that!

a question though, dear readers: since this LJ is intended to be pretty anonymous, is there any benefit in switching to friends-only postings, or is posting publicly (as I have been doing) just as good? I'm tinkering with the idea &mdash; do you think it's easier to record the contents of your brain that way, or does it make no difference?

perhaps I should continue as I began&hellip; just thinking aloud right now, really. am incredibly sleepy, so I won't do a ramble or a brain dump right now

I've had a honking great post gestating inside me now for the last couple of weeks. won't write it right now when I'm nearly dead on my feet in need ot sleep. by way of summary though, in advance: I'm more than pretty happy right now; I'm going around with a smile on my face all day, every day, or, if not a visible one, a smile inside.

"event","Once again it's been months since I posted. I can claim (truthfully) to having been jammed up timewise with hardly a moment left to breathe. Not (entirely) because life has been full of interesting stuff (although it had its moments) but just because lately I'm very good at letting normal everyday stuff use up every waking (and sleeping!) moment. Still, I'm very glad I get to squeeze in a moderate amount of other stuff too, and if I did actually have the time to make more regular postings, then that might mean I'd have more time, perhaps due to having a less interesting life. That said, like everybody, I'd really like to have time to post semi-regularly, have an interesting extra-curricular life, and somehow (somehow!) have enough time to get enough sleep.

Ah, sleep! A commodity I treasure very highly yet there never seems to be time for enough of it. Every weekend I think ""phew, a chance to catch up on some sleep"" yet then I end up staying up super-late ('cos I don't have to get up early, right?) and then getting even less sleep over the weekend than on a weeknight. Moan moan, whinge whinge &mdash; complaining is becoming a speciality lately.

Posting this on a Sunday night when I 'should' be sleeping instead, 'cos I've been up late the last three nights, and may also have been drinking, to greater or lesser extent, on all of them &mdash; and I <em>know</em> I'll be cursing my four alarm clocks come tomorrow morning. Ah well.

Last night was spent with about 20 relatives (or near-relatives) and somebody made sure the wine glasses were kept continuously filled. Since most of these relatives are mad crazy alcoholic chain smokers I was probably drunk under the table several times over. Being buggered from the previous night probably reduced my endurance a little.

The previous night was spent imbibing a medium variety of drinks across several locations around the city, with a varying number of new friends and/or workmates. The last few years, many of my new friends have started off in the workplace, and have continued as friendships even as we all went in different directions. I guess by this age, the workplace is one of the main places for meeting new people, unless you're so incredibly outgoing that you meet strangers on the street (I'm not). I can say that, overall, that night was a success, and I think I remember most of it :)

Actually, part of the motivation for writing about it was that it ended in a little bit of confusion. Nothing very bad happened, but I left the evening with more than a little confusion on my part, over whether I'd said things I shouldn't have done, or whether I'd misunderstood (or even just not heard properly) things that were said. I'm not especially good at understanding people except when things are spelled out for me in big bold letters :) &mdash; in other words, I think it's very easy for things to go right over my head.

I'm not sure if this is what happened at all, and quite possibly a good deal of the confusion belongs with the other person who was there for that part of the evening. Part of it probably relates to how they handle bits of the world, or people like me. 

I'm being semi-vague on purpose because it doesn't seem right to relate clearly exactly who said what and so on. My memory is probably a little fuzzy due to alcohol anyway. Suffice to say that the conversation took interesting turns through various bits of politics and religion (always potential minefields, especially when drunk!) and then suddenly took a sharp turn left and my conversation partner thought it best to leave. That's where I'm very confused, especially because I don't <em>think</em> I said or did anything inappropriate, although I'm worried that something I said may have been misconstrued. I think it's best that I should try to talk to this person when I see them next to try to clear up the confusion.

So anyway, she left in a hurry. I felt it would be a little silly to sit there in the pub by myself, so I left too. After a bit of to-ing and fro-ing getting out of the pub, once we were outside, since we were both walking in the same direction, I said that I would walk with her until our paths diverged. That was OK. She was very quiet at this point. I said that I was quite alarmed at her sudden change from chatty bubbliness to closed up something-or-other, but didn't get much answer to this. When I pursued the matter what felt like just a little further, she stopped walking suddenly and indicated that I should just walk on ahead, leaving her alone.

I did this, not knowing what I could do better, and wanting to respect her space, but kept a careful eye over my shoulder so that I could see that she was travelling safely for as long as I could. I reached home, by myself, a short while later, and a few text messages went back and forth between us that tried to explain or clear things up a little. I'm still confused.

I feel a couple of things. One, I feel bad relating what I have just related, since (although this fairly anonymous) I have described what happened between two people, and I am only one of those two &mdash; the events are also personal to her as well. Two, although alcohol was involved, I'm anxious that the person in question is feeling alright about the whole situation. Three, I feel confused and disappointed in a way because I'm worried that I may have either lost part of a connection to a very new friend or that that connection may have become jeapordised or damaged in some way.

Although I'm not the world's best inter-relater with people, people are still incredibly important to me, more so than anything else in life. I absolutely love having friends, even the irregular ones. Making new connections with new people and getting to know new people is also important to me, and not just because I know that friends fade in and out of life &mdash; I don't mean to suggest that I need to replace old lost friends, but one of the most delightful things about getting to know new people in any way is just that: getting to know them. My clumsiness probably impedes that a lot, and quite possibly that's what happened in this case."

I <em>love</em> female friends. And not just because I'm single right now :) I don't think it's sexist to say that women have different characteristics to men, and to observe that male friends are good for talking about quite boring shite like cars and computers and whatnot, but woman friends are very good about talking about <em>STUFF</em>. We'll define 'stuff' later, but suffice to say that it means 'serious stuff really worth talking about'. Definitely not football, or the weather, or anything like that. Things related to life and living. And existence.

I seem to have a number of female friends. Not a huge number, but a few. And I'm thoroughly delighted to have them. Not because I'm desperate or single or anything stupid like that, but because they are, in many ways, far more valuable than male friends. Male friends are great, and have their own special qualities. Female friends seem to have a better <em>understanding</em> of life. Possibly it's just because they talk more about 'stuff' and men are more closed in that regard, but conversations about 'stuff' are far more meaningful and valuable to me than trivial conversations about 'boy' stuff.

Hmm, maybe I should've been a girl :) &mdash; although I wonder whether female-female conversations can have the same character as female-male conversations, at least the kind I'm talking about. I do know that it's widely accepted that men are simple, predictable and fairly daft (not exclusively; I'm sure that many (including me!) would except themselves from that summary) &mdash; and that women are complicated, unpredictable and clever (in very <em>human</em> ways)

I dearly love all my woman friends. Some more than others, and in different ways, of course, but I'm truly blessed to have any of them, and I hope they realise how much I appreciate them. My man friends are great too, but they're blokes :) Well, I value them a lot too, but in other ways. I'd like to have, and to continue to have, a healthy mix of friends of both genders. This is not a post about male friends. Sorry guys :)

I always feel privileged when I get to talk about 'stuff' with my friends. Not necessarily my stuff, nor their stuff, but 'stuff'. And by 'stuff' I mean the serious human things about life that, from time to time, we all run into. Crises that adults experience. Life events. Insights into the human condition. More about crises. I mean their stuff, and my stuff. Their stuff becuase I feel worthwhile and useful when I can just be a sounding board, and my stuff because it gives me an outlet that maybe I didn't even know I needed. Either way around, it proves, to me at least, that I <em>exist</em> and that I'm real and human. Being validated in that way is very, well, validating. It's also great to feel that, even in a tiny way, my presence or existence for one of my friends in this way has made things better for them, or helped a little bit, or provided a bit of useful insight."

This place is great in many ways &mdash; it's an escape from the rest of the world, and, at times, it marks many milestones in my life, both good and bad, and it's a kind of alternative universe, where time moves at a different speed.

I have been coming here for many years, since I was a small child; at first with my parents, later with friends or with lovers &mdash; or both. This time I'm with my father, and it's unusual for us to spend time together like this, but it's been nice so far. No 'deep' conversations yet. Perhaps in a way I'm waiting for him to break the seal, and maybe that's a reflection of my allegedly passive nature, of which more anon (not necessarily in this post)

This is the first time in a <em>very</em> long time (12..13 years maybe?) that I've come here without being either with a significant other, or with a former significant other also present. I was considering coming here alone a few months ago, but am not alone this time. I don't know whether any of that is significant or not, but it's just an observation. I also don't <em>think</em> this is the wine typing, although since this is backdated I'll have a chance to review it while completely sober before I actually post it.

I must start getting my most-recent significant-other out of my mind &mdash; and this is a process that's been ongoing for a good while now; you could say that it was high time that this process was finished, surely. Maybe this isn't one of those things that we have much control over, maybe it is, but we surely have, at least, some control over the speed of this process. Have we? I have been spending (wasting?) a great deal of brain time, happily now reducing, troubling, often involuntarily, over matters related to this.

Back to where I am now. The previous SEVEN times I have been here, my most-recent SO was present. She wasn't my SO for the last two, but was for the previous five. Eek. That's at least partly why this place marks many milestones, I think &mdash; often related to the beginnings or the ends of relationships.

I've just realised that I could write a lot if I kept on going like this. More than befits a single posting, at least. Not sure whether it's better to write a gigantic rambling post or to write several posts around the same time. If I was organised then I might split my ramblings up according to category or something, and maybe make several simultaneous posts, although I'm not sure how much help that might be.

Now there isn't any real point to this post. And, as usual, fair play to you if you're still reading :) It just seemed reasonable start writing as I was sitting here, in this particular location, and with Tom Waits and little (just a little!) alcohol applied. Hmm, maybe I should apply a moratorium to LJ posts in even moderately close proximity to alcohol, or it'll start sounding like I'm a total piss artist. Is there an appropriate keyword to use for alcohol-related postings?

Enough about alcohol. Eh, what's my point? Nothing really. I'm just recording the moment &mdash; sitting in this semi-significant place, with my father (that much in itself a fairly unusual event) in a mellow state of mind, but with great awareness of facts and events and states of minds and confluences of all sorts of things. Nothing approaching a planetary alignment or anything, but enough to prompt me to write anyway. Maybe tomorrow I'll write something with at least a theme or a point, and less rambly. I have a feeling that when I get home in a couple of days and go to post this it'll all seem like a big pointless ramble. But isn't that the point, in a way? Do all of our posts have to have a point?

I suppose if we wish to have any kind of audience, no matter how small (and I realise mine is pretty small as it is) then it's worth our while putting some decent effort into making our posts worth reading. And low-frequency huge posts are probably less enticing than more-frequent short posts. Hmm &mdash; is it quantity or quality that counts?

Stopping work on this post for now. If this is the last line, then I probably stopped in time."

Love is a big part of it. But
true love carries more:

"event","Here's a quick question or two; try and answer if you're (say) 21 or older:<ul>
<li>Are you an adult?</li>
<li>If you're male, can you say that you are a man?</li>
<li>If you're female, can you say that you are a woman?</li>
<li>[fill in your own question here if neither of the previous two apply to you]</li>
</ul>When I was a child, I always supposed that at some point one made a fairly-immediate transition to being a grownup, that there wasn't much of an intermediate stage between childhood and adulthood, and that &mdash; somehow &mdash; one would know everything one neeeded to know, one would have a job, probably a spouse and children, and that all of that would continue along some simple idealised continuum just like in a young child's learning-to-read book with perfect families in it and so on.

More to the point, I thought then that once all-growed-up, one would have all the answers and know what to do, that one would never experience crises any more, and that simple 'childish' feelings like rage, jealousy, discontent, resentment (etc&hellip;) would all be replaced with some kind of self-assured contentment.

Who was to know? They didn't teach us in school that even supposed adults have lives that are packed full of ups and downs, of unexpected situations where we just don't know what to do to make things right. (after all, when a child, if something was wrong, we went to an adult to get it fixed, right?) It takes <em>years</em> of more learning after we (legally, at least) become adults as we stumble into all sorts of things and just have try to work out the answers.

Incidentally, this post should be read as balanced; reword it if it doesn't feel balanced; for every negative thing I mention above, if there are fewer corresponding positive things, then fill those in, and re-read.

"event","So much recently hinges around
The 'if this' and 'were that'
But it has no effect, of course
Is it a waste, of time?

Or is there a better way
To direct one's thoughts
If directed, they can be.
Oh, more 'if this' &mdash; again!

Maybe it is a natural part
Of the human condition. If so
Then we are cursed. I think.
But feelings define humanity

And they can feel like a curse
But without them we would
Be machines, no more. So happy
Or sad, they make us exist.

Proof that we are real, in 
A strange kind of way. Both 
Good and bad feelings provide
This proof, but we know which we prefer

"event","It's Saturday night and I'm sitting on the sofa, writing a LJ entry on this laptop. Several years ago I would have thought there was something wrong if I didn't have something explicit to do on a Saturday night &mdash; some people to meet, if nothing else. Back then I would often go to the trouble of arranging something and getting friends together just so that something would happen.

I still usually feel, as Saturday evening approaches, as though it would be better if I had 'something on' &mdash; but I'm getting a bit more comfortable now with being alone; I'm pretty happy sitting here, in, not out, and alone, not in company. Years ago, when I was a student, I was incapable of eating lunch alone; I would skip lunch rather than eat it by myself; the idea of sitting in the canteen-place alone at a table was not a pleasant one: surely everybody would be looking at the person sitting alone and wondering why they that person had no apparent friends. So when actually hungry, I would scour the campus hunting from some friend or other to drag along to join me for lunch.

Maybe Saturdays are a bit like that. Even today, I had a momentary wave of uneasiness as my late afternoon lunch meetee went home at 1700. But I had a few things to do this evening (exciting stuff: had three new nineteen-inch rack-mount shelves that had to be mounted, and my living-room rack rearranged slightly to fit them in and some equipment shifted to them. Woohoo&hellip;) so I've managed to pass it alone and contentedly.

I did have a telephone call from an only-occasionally-seen friend (after a brief volley of text messages; she was being efficient, as is her wont) &mdash; this was very welcome, and lasted for 40 minutes. We had not spoken for about three months and after the usual recent-news-swapping, covered recent angst-ridden situations of mine, divorce, cohabitation, lawyers, therapy (various kinds, their uses, and their relevance), and plenty of related stuff in between all of those. I both enjoyed the conversation and found it very supportive.

So in summary: while once upon a time I would have hated to spend to spend a Saturday evening by myself, today I am quite comfortable to do so. I'm almost even enjoying my own company; looking forward to my bed, because I am tired.

"event","A flickering candle sits
Alone upon the window sill
It could be that it beckons its
Owner in from out the cold

Here they come, and one of them
Lit the candle two hours ago
To mark the place as occupied
To keep it warm, to make it home

They arrive, and enter now
This cosy space, a safe place
They leave the candle; it keeps
The atmosphere alive in this space

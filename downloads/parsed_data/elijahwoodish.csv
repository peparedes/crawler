"event","Yes, school clothes- You can never have enough.  After spending probably over 100 dollars on back to school clothes, I have finally realized I have enough jeans to clothe the entire school.  I picked out my ""first day of school outfit,"" which is a pleated skirt, an orange *skin tight* shirt with a bow in the corner tied around a sleeve, a cross necklace, nifty earrings and a bracelet.  Oh yes, and nice shoes of course.  Notice how I said skin tight.  That's because it is.  It'd look better if I lost a few pounds, though.  But heck, anything to flatter my 'figure' and my padded bra.  :-P  3 more days...  Woo.  Oh yeah, when I was digging through a pile of shoes, I FOUND MY ELIJAH JACKET THAT HAS BEEN MISSING FOR A YEAR.  I cried when I found it and hugged it to death.  Wee, I'm so happy! 
I'm getting a 'makeover' done Saturday with Theresa.  Blonde highlights, nails, waxed eyebrows...  The works.  I can't get my darn hair relaxed due to the fact that the damn salon is 'out of supplies.'  Fuck them, I want straiter hair.  But the poof is pretty sexy... I think.  :)

"event","Yay, it's time for back to school!  So, I've got to get my body back in tip top shape!  Of course I have to look good to attract all the perverted gentlemen that thrive in the high school.  I ended the two week deadline of 'eating like a pig' today, and now it's back to the diet yet again, but this time I've got to stick to it due to the fact that there are only two weeks left of summer!  I've got to exercise and diet like hell, and I doubt I'll lose ten pounds, but I can lose maybe 5!  I CAN'T FAIL, SIR!  *the boot camp begins tomorrow, yikes!*"

"event","Heck, I may be back to normal Stacy, but I'm still not quitting the dieting thing.  1,200 calories isn't enough to cut major weight fast, but if I can stick to it I should lose 10 pounds eventually.  I used to be 105 pounds.  WOW, I never realized how good that was.  I don't know what the fuck happened but I gained 10 pounds and now I'm stuck at 115.  I diet one day, eat a lot with friends the next, and it keeps canceling out!  God damn as soon as school comes back to me I can at least not be eating with friends constantly.  I tried on my bathing suit today and I have seemed to develop a little belly fat.  ICK.  I've got a party saturday and I'm going to be the fattest girl there.  115 pounds of pure blobness.  I feel so guilty after going out eating, I think I'm going to stop the eating part.  It's starting to make me depressed.  Saturday's party is going to have pizza and subs.  Wonderful.  ARGGGG.  :("

"event","Right now I'm looking at a picture of Mary Kate Olsen and wondering, is she short?  She doesn't seem to be 6 feet tall, but almost as short as me.  Whoa, that's cool.  Do I have the potential to be that skinny, or to live my life as a fat ass?  Only God knows.  I've been following the diet religiously, and Weight Watchers is actually a pretty exciting diet.  Tons of support.  But sadly, I fear that this week is going to end in shame.  Thursday is my typical fast food for dinner day, I can eat my dinner and not worry about anything.  But friday there is an end of the year picnic for the park program, which promises tons of food.  I'm going to have to only eat there and eat no breakfast and no dinner later on, unless I can control myself which I don't want to do.  Saturday is the peach and ice cream social, which promises tons of fat food to gorge on.  Sunday I'm going to the Reading Outlets with mom to go back to school clothes shopping and look fat and to buy my all time favorite tradition of CHEESECAKE.  Yummage.  But trust me, I've got the skills to eat all this stuff and still not cheat on Weight Watchers.  YOU WILL SEE."

"event","It seems to good to be true.  I looked at the list of all the food places and decided this place is definately for me, since I love eating.  Now, I know no one will want to go with me because I'm a very hated person, so I guess I'll try to pressure mum to go, even though she ""hates eating"" and ""hates music.""  Heck, if worst comes to worst, I'll take a bus there, buy a caramel apple and ice cream, and maybe even see Aaron Carter!  Arg, this is going to be a stressful week.  Today I still must wash the dishes, go to the YMCA, figure out all this Musikfest shit, and complete four journal entries for history.  Fuck, Aaron Carter is there on sunday, and I can't go that day.  Darn!  Who ever this ""Chingy"" is, well, I know who he is, but I don't really listen to his music because he's all ghetto, but I might see him.  Arg.  I'll see anything that'll entertain my depressed self.  Yes, I've labeled myself as depressed.  Why?  Hm, let's see.  My mom is constantly calling me names or screaming at me, and saying I'm going to get fat when she doesn't even know I'm on weight watchers, where it's pretty much impossible to get fat.  What else?  She says I'm never getting braces, which massively sucks, because now I have to go through another year of school not smiling using my teeth, and being self conscious of my mouth.  I can't even show any expression due to the fact my teeth are so screwed up!  I MIGHT AS WELL BE A FUCKING ROBOT.  My mom also says that right after she ""pays"" (yea right) for me to go to college, that I'll meet a boy and marry him and never see her again.  Jeez, I'm not going to freaking never come home.  I'm going to end up paying for all my college, my own braces, and my own damn car, because my mom doesn't seem to understand that when she bore me into this world, she put herself into a life in which she needs to give up some of her precious money for another life.  I have some potential, I'm a smart kid, I could be the fucking doctor that in the near future has to perform brain surgury on the bitch.  *sigh*  I'm stuck with a screwed up face and a collegeless future.  Life could be better at the moment.  Oh yea, I slept over Krista M's house and the next day I was a bit crabby from lack of sleep and mum says I have a chemical imbalance and I need medication so the next time you see me, I'll most likely be drugged up on something.  And she wonders why all my friends are scared of her.  Jesus.

"event","Yesterday I decided to go on a excursion with my 50+ dollars and travel to Wal*Mart using the bus.  But first I went to the bank and depositing my paycheck.  I now have over 100 dollars in my savings account, woo!  Anyhoo, I went to Redners and made a salad from the salad bar, and I used this instant coffee machine and screwed it up because I didn't know you were supposed to put a cup underneath the coffee shooter and the coffee spewed out and splashed all over the place.  Yea, I'm smart.  I then went to Wal*Mart and bought a ton of stuff and stole Cracker Jacks.  Actually, I sat down in the sewing section while waiting for my photos to be developed, and read magazines and ate them!  I then convieniently put the bag in my Redners bag, and never got caught.  Hm.  I finally bought a bra that is a REAL one.  It has a hook in the back and everything.  I don't get it though.  It creates boobs that are more like pointy horns than flesh and blood.  I also got a label maker, labels, a lunch box so I can pack nutritious lunches (no more starvation lunches like last year), two expandable folders which contain 6 folders each, earrings, a workout tape (I did the leg workout today and I'm doing the arm one tomorrow.  It really works!  Ouchee.), a change purse, and some other things that I can't remember at the moment.  After Wal*Martness, I took the bus home, and in a few hours it was time to go to the YMCA.  My personal trainer dude wasn't hot, he was in fact the geekiest of all geeks.  He even had special nerd glasses, which rocked, but god damn...  He taught me a few things, and I did some strength training, then I did 35 minutes in the cardio room on the elliptical trainer thingee, and I was dripping in sweat.  Woo, sweat.  Heh.  I then did more strength training and then went home.  I finished my history assignment for the day, and then played Runescape for the rest of the night.  I'm obsessed.  *sigh*  Today I ate a Doctor Phil bar and a peach, and I feel good about myself.  Yesterday after all the workouts I have 837 calories in me, which is great.  You see, the only time I feel good about myself is when I actually follow the diet for the day.  I don't have cravings yet today, and I'm doing good.  Phew.  Fuck, I have to go sell newspapers, which means free McDonalds.  I'm just getting the salad and no one will tell me other wise!  But I do find it funny when this fat girl always picks on me because I get the salads,and one day I got 'fat food' and she made a big deal out of it.  Excuse me Wench, but I care about my body.  The guy who runs the fucking thing is so obese that he's like a living blob, so he can't say anything about it.  He's such a fucking retard though, he takes young kids to McDonalds when he knows it's bad for you.  Jeez, what's wrong with the world today?  Wish me luck.  3pm-7pm.  No food.  I'm going to be hungry.  That's the only reason I dislike this newspaper thing even though I get a ton of money.  NO FOOD.  Wah.

"event","I actually had a dream last night, which is odd because I never have any.  Mostly the whole thing was about me rekindling my old frienship with Chris Noonan and his brother.  I swear, when I was younger, I was over at his house every god damned day.  Then he moved, and we like never talked again.  Anyhoo, in the dream, his mom came to pick me up and we all went to Perkins which for some reason was located in the 25th St Shopping Center.  Strange.  And the whole time, I was wearing some kind of ugly winter outfit, like something a little kid would wear.  Maybe I was going back into the past to when I was a kid, but Chris and Johnny were both the age they are now.  I felt so damn ugly- My hair was under this weird hat, and I had my glasses on.  The meaning of this dream?  I think it proved to me that I need to find a friend who I can hang out with whenever I want because they live down the street from me.  It felt <i>good</i> to have a friend like Chris.  Maybe I just want my childhood to come back- Where I could hang out with any of my neighbors and we played fun games and ate all the food we wanted.  Too bad I lost Nichelle, the only friend I had who lived near me.  STUPID ME!  :P

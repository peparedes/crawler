Council Chamber (#563J)
A long, stone table in the shape of a half-oval dominates this imposing chamber; the mosaic of precious and semi-precious stones on its surface glimmers eyecatchingly in the glowlight.  Chairs for the original six Weyrleader-pairs rim its curved portion, while seats for visitors and others range opposite; the particular 'arrangement' becomes flexible when more or fewer people are around.  Extra chairs line one wall; they're most often needed for a Fort council.
Artisans have put much time and energy into this room, and it shows in the lavish wall 'tapestries' (three look particularly new), the elaborate 'cushions' that soften the stone chairs, as well as the delicate 'scrollwork' that graces even the stone itself.
Eleni is here.
Obvious exits:
Bowl       Balcony       Records Room       Sr. Weyr

When a mid-weight bronze presented himself from ::between:: over Fort Weyr's bowl he bore a brusque though not unfriendly greeting to the watchdragon.  Aboleoth, the brown-hued dragon called himself and his rider known as B'ane.  It wasn't any secretive gait the dragonrider took to the feeding pens before he went Weyrwoman hunting aided by one of Penyn's ingenues--she in fact announces him into the council chambers.

The presence of Ista's Weyrsecond striding into the council chambers comes as no surprise, with blue Yolith promptly reporting to Eviyath once he's acknowledged Aboleoth in the Fortian skies and given cautious welcome. Eleni couldn't have been in the council chambers long to judge by her appearance, dressed in a pair of oil-spotted wherhide trousers common to dragonriders at work. Time enough to change into a fresh top, at least, and wash her hands and face before vacating her weyr. The Weyrwoman's standing when B'ane enters, showing him a smile before requesting of the girl who led the way, ""Mandie, a pot of klah please? Thank you."" As the assistant departs on her errand, Ellie turns back toward B'ane to say, ""Weyrsecond, welcome. What brings you here today?""

When the Headwoman's assistant subtracts herself from the room B'ane takes her place as a much taller, experienced substitution.  ""Weyrwoman Eleni I presume?""  The bronzerider owns a generally soft speaking voice as out of place in Fort as it is in Ista.  Its roots are of Tillek.  ""I'm doing favors you could say.""  Time bides to allow Eleni opportunity to sit first.  Calm, introspective, B'ane is also clothed in drab darks save for the orange wound in his knot.

>> I sense that Eviyath's view from her ledge encompasses a sun-filled bowl, and the warmth from the rock below her belly radiates up, up, extends, encompasses. But despite the heat, there is something a bit disgruntled in her greeting: Aboleoth interrupted her oiling. <<

>> I bespoke Eviyath with: I sense that Aboleoth has no direction to intervene in Fort's everyday minutia between dragons.  He stands at the fringe of conversations neither challenging nor pompous.  He certainly has no designs to speak to any queens, especially Eviyath.  Able to be freely read, more so than his rider, Aboleoth is at least as steadfast with metallic clarity of presence and patience to observe. <<

""That's me,"" Eleni affirms cheerfully, gesturing the bronzerider toward a seat and then pulls one out for herself. ""Favors,"" she repeats humorously, without the question in her voice that the repetition implies. ""I hope they don't leave a bad taste in your mouth. Fortunately, we've klah to wash it away."" Though Mandie's yet to return.

>> I sense that Eviyath is present still, although receding to a certain degree, allowing Aboleoth freedom of range without heavy-handed attention. A glow in the back of the mind, a bright corner, a suggestion in the glimpse of an unoccupied spot by the Starstones in full sun. <<

B'ane sits comfortably without much of a slouch once cued.  ""I'm B'ane,"" title clearly deficient.  The knot of Istan Weyrsecond is visible, there's little doubt from him Eleni can absorb that much.  At her choice in phrase the man smiles winningly, just a quick sign of teeth before his face relaxes.  ""Klohi, she's a greenrider in my wing who I understood caused some commotion.  She means well, she's just green-- inexperienced green.  I know you know she's a greenrider.""  So the favor flowers on behest of a certain wingmate.  ""Harquith didn't do any real damage did she?""

>> I bespoke Eviyath with: Aboleoth bespoke me with >> As a creature of size Aboleoth values a source of sun to regulate a sense of comfort owed to basking.  Coming into flight he follows the whim placed in his mind and lands near the Starstones to refresh his hide in good faith. <<

""Ah. Yes."" Unsurprised, Eleni leans back into her chair and hears B'ane out with a steady gaze and a not-quite-open expression. ""No, no real damage."" Mandie's timing is fortuitous, impeccable: Eleni couldn't have asked for a better moment for a pause. The girl knocks lightly on the door before letting herself in, tray in hand. Klah and a selection of shortbread. When Mandie would serve them both, Eleni dissuades her with a smile. ""That's fine, thank you."" Eleni chooses to play hostess and pour the klah herself. ""Inexperience,"" she resumes as Mandie quietly closes the door behind her, ""is no excuse for poor manners. If you don't mind my saying so. Do you take cream or sugar?""

Good timing indeed, Mandie.  B'ane avoids a sense of awkwardness during the pause for refreshments, he and silence can be called confidants.  ""Neither for me thanks.  I kind of like that 'fresh off the tree' taste,""  a wafer of shortbread accompanies the klah to his hand but is held in place for now.  ""We'll have to work on that.""  He commits a touch sheepishly.  ""If you don't mind, what sort of relationship does Fort have with Ista?  You know, generally. I'm new at this position.""  More or less, give or take several decades and an Interval. 

Eleni passes over B'ane's undoctored klah before serving herself (cream, no sweetener), settling back into her chair with the mug held between both hands. ""I would expect the same of any of my riders,"" Eleni introduces a point of fairness in the discussion before considering the question Ista's Weyrsecond puts to her with a frown-line creasing her brow. It clears when she responds evenly, ""The Weyrwoman and I are on friendly terms. I'm less acquainted with your current Weyrleader."" Eleni leaves out the part where the relations between her and the former Weyrleader were not quite so friendly. ""And of course you know that we have regular exchanges with Ista. Fort is happy to enjoy good relations with Ista.""

B'ane swirls a rectangle of shortbread within the unsophisticated serving of klah and seems in his element until a blob of it detaches en route to his mouth.  The soggy shortbread doesn't keep standard form when B'ane tries to grasp it from his lap, it just breaks into smaller elements and smears all the way to his thigh.  Playing it off, he leaves it like its fashionable.  ""That's good,"" hands back to the chair, one intermittently waving, ""that's good because I'd hate, we'd hate, to have something trivial like this effect those good relations.  The next Fortian rider to give a little lip we'll overlook and be even, mm?""  Eyebrows flick high then re sink.  ""Good klah.""

A smile twitches for B'ane's trouble with the shortbread. It remains as the Istan speaks, but the quality changes: a front, maybe, for a game played out in polite words and delicate suggestions. ""As would we. Though should a Fortian rider give lip,"" a beat, with a little stress on the word choice picked up from B'ane, ""I would want appropriate action taken, the wingleader notified. We would rather not encourage the repetition of such behavior."" She pauses, yet to raise her klah to her lips, and holds her smile as she regards the man across the way. ""Particularly when that 'lip'--"" That word again, the stress now indicating its inappropriacy, ""--extends to insulting those with rank. Such as weyrwomen. Imagine if that should next extend to your beholden Lords."" It's her turn to raise an eyebrow.

B'ane's dark eyes under their prominent brow bone face Eleni.  ""Consider her wingleader notified.""  In compound rank of Weyrsecond is wingleader of Baysweeper.  ""Klohi's my responsibility.""  Though a raised mug obscures much of his face it doesn't block his eyes or their gaze.  ""I appreciate your time, Weyrwoman, I can relate to how busy you must be.""  Not appearing as one to solicit much physical contact there's no outreach for the goldrider's hand.  Said mug of klah with still some remaining is nudged to the serving tray when he rises.  With taciturn strength wired in his carriage, B'ane nods once decorously.

""Good. I shall leave it in your capable hands."" The firm, pleasant tone of a matter settled to everyone's satisfaction, though that might not be quite the truth of it. ""It's my pleasure,"" Eleni continues along the same lines, letting her klah rest. ""I would appreciate your rider apologizing. And then, of course, she would be free to return."" 

Capable Hands B'ane bears witness to the mound of soggy shortbread leaving his lap.  It's no true reflection to his abilities otherwise.  Pointing from standing height, ""someone will clean that up right?""  Because he believes it so, the Weyrsecond institutes a last low wave and vanishes out the door in a tall man's short order.  Aboleoth is only reluctant to be roused for the first fifteen seconds it takes to travel the distance from Starstones to bowl floor."

Sandy Beach
This long stretch of beach seems to be farther up and back from the crashing waves of the ocean. The smell of salt and seaweed is hanging in the air, and the wind is harsh. In the distance you can hear the sound of the crashing surf as it rushes in towards the sand. The black sands of the beach hide many a treasure, from the occasional hollow guarded by a firelizard to dropped trinkets from beach goers and beach scavengers alike.
  It is a spring evening.  Partly cloudy skies allow for a gentle, if breezy day.
You see Kaijuth, Calafath, and Sephiroth here.
Jordan, Ai'den, J'rlen, I'deni, and S'tao are here.
Obvious exits:
Main Beach

The comment and question should be made of I'deni, as Ai'den watches Jordan yank free of his hand, and then take off running down the beach, shedding scarfs.  ""You /did/ teach her that it's the dragons that chase, right?""  There's an odd quark to Ai'den's brow, and he seems to be having a lot more trouble with this whole rising concept then his strange, colorful weyrmate has, but he still takes off at a rapid walk down the beach to follow her.  The stiff-backed man is not about to run after her like a child wanting to pull pigtails.  Unlike Tallailath, Kaijuth shows no respect to the first beast that he manages to catch, hamstringing it with claws and pouncing atop it as it falls in screams of panic and pain.  Contrasting her bright zubrance is the dark shift in mood that takes place within the shadowy bronze as blood is sucked down greedily, the animal barely ending its struggle before he paces away from it and gives chase to another panicked bull.  Where Tallailath is brilliant color, Kaijuth is stark, sharp flashes of lightning and sulfer on a midnight black backdrop. His jaws lash forward, snapping at Paquith as the landing bronze distracts him from his chase, wings flailing and hissing violently.  << Mine. >> No, not the bull, not the squished meat under Paquith's paws.  Tallailath.  She's -his-.  Another hiss, flash of teeth, and posturing before his gaze shifts to lock the green in his sights.  

Aboleoth has a better grasp of timing than his rider, a point to be underscored when it comes to flights.  The veteran bronze's already blooded without garnering much harm to anyone else--a show of teeth and lunge feint often do the trick.  He's come to regard Tallailath as an object available to all and haunts her movements with a steady glare of purple-spinning eyes.  B'ane is in the distance, coming, while trying to tend to a buckle on the side of a boot.

Jordan is breathless and laughing at whatever thoughts run through her mind, using a wall near the entrance to the cove as support until she regains her bearings.  She's remarkably bereft of scarves, though still fashionably clad in those too-bright colors.  It's a long, flowing dress with a tendency to swirl around her ankles any and every time she so much as moves.  Each man that arrives is eyed, her grin slowly growing as she sends out a hopeful query.  ""Someone brought me a drink, right?""  Tallailath has had her fill of drink, and after aiming a very dirty shot at Sephiroth (sand in the eyes, anyone?) launches into the air.  For a green, she's quick.  Thank those over-sized wings of hers.  She seeks to gain height first and foremost, with irregular spurts of speed to further taunt those who follow.  << Can you feel it? >> She echoes to the males present, her mind a bright flash of exploding colors.  << It's wonderful, isn't it? >>  Her wings beat powerfully, carrying her that much farther from them.  << Empowering! >>

T-minus Ten. Nine. Eight. Eff it. Going up now! *FWOOSH!* Paquith launches, pure speed the second his haunches bunch and he explodes into the sky << Keep up, boys! >> is the lilted comment as the bronze flashes upwards, all metal-soldered wings and red-racing frame. I'deni prowls after the rest, silent in the sand, and oddly barefoot as well. He answers Jordan, ""Absolutely. Come and get it."" Liar, or speaking about something else.

Despite Tallailath's dirty trick, S'tao holds out a wineskin towards Jordan, catching up to her and the others despite his easy seeming pace. He knew where they were headed after all and it's not the 'chase' here that matters at all. ""This one's pretty good."" he says rather huskily, meaning the opened skin in hand though his eyes stray over Jordan's figure, ignoring any glowers thrown his way, Ai'den in particular. In the drama unfolding above, Sephiroth's second lids flick close, the thin membrane enough protection against the flick of sand. THey're enough to see through, the glow of Tallailath's hide and the familiar skies above enough of a guide for him to quickly launch after her, losing only a moment before he's skyward bound too. Never the less, he sounds out a low growl instead of his usual challenging bugle as he pumps his broad red-clad wings furiously to regain lost lengths between him and his target. The laconic bronze sends no words as usual, just a sending of flashing metal upon metal, the clang of swords ringing out in sharp retort.

Ai'den had brought nothing to drink, and is having an awefully hard time not chasing off the other males that arrive (hah, as if he'd be able to).  He finds a rock to sit on and does just that, crossing his arms against his chest.. more hugging them there.. and fighting off the need to pace back and forth in front of Jordan like a watchdog.  Colors?  There are no colors beyond green and black and some of the darkest thoughts Kaijuth can impart. In the meantime, Kaijuth isn't nearly so fast as the little (large) green, though he does manage a quick takeoff.  Being bottom heavy, with more muscle then fat, gives him the advantage in a vertical takeoff, and the ground shivers as he shoves off, his mind silent and cold, burning and lustful.  Try as he might, he's not going to be able to catch up with the agile, speedy green no matter how fast he pumps those wings of his, so he'll just have to rely on...smarts.  And.. cunning.  (HAH)

B'ane is dragging his feet as much as anyone can without actually dragging his feet.  ""C'mon, fourth green today...""  It's a given there's a remnant of fate-curser in those Terran ancestors of his.  ""Let's get this over with, good call with the wine, S'tao.  Jordan,"" the Weyrsecond passes on a brief courtesy greeting as Aboleoth draws his legs under his body and hurtles vertically after the young green.  As a rule the bronze is seldom a pace setter but a true bringing of woe should any competitor bar his way to the female.  He snaps at the feet of a brown from Tallailath's clutch for the fault of merely existing in that space at that time.  

Tallailath was about the chase, the fun, the excitement... the tricks.  Her steep climb for height is suddenly a break neck dive, her form tight and streamlined as she seeks to cut a sharp path downwards.  Jordan's guests, when they come, are regarded with that smile that always seems to grow wider and wider.  Both I'deni and S'tao's offers are boldly met as Jordan slips closer to I'deni, seeking to find that drink he lies about.  Not finding it she aims a pout at him, ""You're horrible.""  Then it's on to S'tao who does have a drink.  It's a bonus that she doesn't have to search for it, either.  She seeks to catch his hand as she reaches for the drink, using it as a lever as she says, ""Dance with me?""  Not that any dance is likely to last long.  Tallailath again plays havoc when she twists within that dive to come back toward the males she'd left behind, unintentionally aiming to play a game of sky chicken with them.  Jordan again echoes her lifemate's actions, spinning away from S'tao with a bubbly laugh and sway - bumping into B'ane on her way toward Ai'den.  ""C'mon, Bai.""  She holds her hands out to him, attempting to lure him to her feet and into that dance she'd demanded some time ago.

I'deni is a tall drink of alcohol, think you very much: intoxicating and determined to get you on the floor. He doesn't close the distance to Jordan as it seems as though she is moving towards him. He just smiles rather faintly, his head still tilted a little bit to the side as if listening after his mate. ""I know,"" is the answer, but he follows with, ""She's a tease now..."" he drawls slowly. Far above, Paquith uses and abuses his speed, cutting corners and rocketing forward with each wing-beat and gravity-pulled plummet. *insert amazing and flashy sound effect here* << Woohoooooo! >> Speed like that for a need like this is worth a 'woohoo'.

S'tao relinquishes the wineskin, but not in time to get dragged close. The steely blue of his eyes are only seen through narrow slits as he gives her a feral look for a moment, daring to try and twirl Jordan around for a step or two before she's off again to tease the others. He huffs softly at her amusements before he pops the closure on his remaining wineskin. A mutter is made about long slow dances versus a quick one, but S'tao really didn't intend for anyone to hear the off color remark. In the cooler air above, the chase starts resembling a game of hot pursuit, with all the twists and turns of a high speed get away. Only the cops are closing in and Sephiroth is amongst them. A green chase is a fast one, as he well knows. Too quick to bide one's time for too long, but he can rely on strength and cunning to outlast the daredevil green. Sephiroth is an old hand at this as well, but he is in fine company tonight with so many of his large brethren filling the skies above the Weyr. 

Grrrrr...  Yes, that growling over there is simply because Jordan's dancing her way over to I'deni and S'tao and she'd gotten a smidge too close (say, within 10 feet) of the pair of them, and Ai'den doesn't like that. He jumps to his feet when Jordan bumps into B'ane, and his lips curled back in a snarl suggests that such contact was strictly prohibited.. and that he's way too 'in tune' with Kaijuth at the moment.  Whenever Jordan holds out her hands to him, he catches them, and snatches, pulling her closer to him as his arm seeks to draw around her possessively.. and the glare leveled on the rest of them is not at all inviting.  Sorry folks. No orgies tonight!  He doesn't share.  He growls down at Jordan quietly, words barely forming.  ""They're too -close-.""  To her.  To Tallailath.  To what was His.  In the meantime, what a coincidence!  Kaijuth is going straight up, and Tallailath is almost coming straight down, just a bit off to the side.  The bronze's eyes widen and where she is all grace of form and ease in the air, he is lumbering and laboring and trying to get more then a couple lengths off the ground.  A quiet, high pitched keeeeen is loosed to the air as he surges forward and awkwardly to the side, trying both to snag her on her way down, and avoid an actual collision.  It's simply going to be over too soon and he's had no time to really warm up!

Aboleoth's eagle design trespasses to hawk territory as he vigorously contracts the outside spars and flexes them anew to gain elevation and swerve chaotically without wasting energy through superfluous wing beats.  Born in his deep chest and held there is a low growl to threaten what he cannot bully by size--as far as bronzes go he's a middleweight and damn good at it, thank you.  The wing brush against Calafath was more of less deliberate and so Aboleoth recovers via a fast dive and parachute pinions, talons ready to rend and capture by force.  A forceful pluck and way to brand the females he catches.  B'ane looks Jordan up and down, once each, after the bump.  Readily to Ai'den, ""she yours, I know.  Maybe she still will be in a few minutes.""

Though she's brought into that embrace and meant to be kept there, Jordan wiggles free - elbowing, pushing and pulling as if she were claustrophobic and not wanting to be trapped.  So even Ai'den is left absent of that dance, though at least he gets a quick kiss before Jordan spins away from him.  Arms thrown up in the air, hips swaying to the song playing through her mind she once again unconsciously mimics her lifemate who twists and turns her way toward that cluster of males.  While Jordan puts herself in the thick of the crowd, spinning and turning and merely enjoying the party, Tallailath seeks to part her way through the males giving chase.  Maybe she seeks to cut a path right straight to Kaijuth who sorely needed the assistance as his wits weren't at all beneficial.  Then again, it's the unexpected thing to do and that typically is what Tallailath seeks to do.  In that unrelenting passion, she opens herself up to them, her focus single minded and therefore blinding her to their proximity.

Paquith isn't much for this twisting and turning. He'll do a barrel-roll though, wings flaring to zip-flash with the illumination of moons only to be lost in the tilt of the spin. This is the ideal moment to turn his mindvoice to a sultry jungle-cat purr << You must be tired, because you've been flying through my mind all night >>. Meanwhile, I'deni watches after the tempting Jordan as she moves with a freedom rarely witnessed. His chest rises and falls with a deep breath of the night air, not cooling, not stilling, just giving rise to other things. This is a flight, after all. Predator eyeing prey.

The circle around the dancers seems to mimic the sky above, at least that's the way it appears in S'tao's mind as the men edge closer one way or another, tightening the trap so to speak. A hand reaching out towards Jordan is more of a gentlemanly invitation for another twirl rather than a lust inspired need to lure her closer, the bronzerider managing to keep his baser instincts and reactions in check far better here than he displays for certain other green's rider. There is no such restrictions on Sephiroth's part though, the diving figure of Tallailath's plummeting setting off intuition as he carves through air currents in a calculated vector intending to snatch her out of the sky before she can reach a target of her own. It is a punishing maneuver, bitter cold air as scathing as a knife lashing out against his pinions and threatening to snap them back before can fold them tight in his defiant swoop.

At first, there's resistance, a good deal of it as Ai'den doesn't want to let his love slip through his arms so blithely.  Still, he's not the type to hold her to the point that he'd break her spirit and so once she wiggles free (and he gets an elbow in the chin and throat), he backs off a step and shakes his head rapidly, raising his hands to the sides of his head as he tries to fight off the madness that is his bond and this situation overall.  Had he his way, she'd be stripped and thrown to the ground and -his- right here and now and anyone that got between that would be rather brutally dealt with.  And yet on a more human level, that rational side that would never allow him to act so crudely, he knows what a Bad idea that'd be.  Still, he finds his eyes drawn back to her as she continues that dance, his gaze following every curve and turn of her body as he once more draws closer towards her, and towards the others in that same turn, since she so insists on dancing amongst the competition.  As for things on Kaijuth's end.. well, shells, he's never seen /this/ before.  He's starting to slowly get his stride and actually chase Tallailath, and suddenly he finds her plowing through through the skies straight /at/ him.  The oddest little confused squawk parts his muzzle, a sound better made for firelizards then dragons, and he slows his flight, half hovering as he watches her attempt to slice through some of the other males.  Upon seeing  her, and likely several males heading his direction, he has the oddest desire to turn and flee like a hare with wolves on it's trail.  Fortunately, he doesn't lose all his man-points by doing so, but it does end up with him simply hovering there, waiting.  Apparently, the girls come to -him- now.  He's just that. Damn. Sexy.  

B'ane is fighting with his cuffs only because he'd rather be manhandling Jordan or fixing the gap in I'deni's teeth.  What gap doesn't exist is also just as easily remedied.  ""Why do they make these so floppy and /pendulous/?""  As many times as they're rolled, six times if you've been counting, the linen/mohair blend of his sleeves are still prone to unravelling.  B'ane: not so much.  His durability is comparable to wool.  Above them Aboleoth crashes through a column of thermals, clubs another bronze a silver-trimmed wing, and freefalls into a pit of equally hormonal males that have every intention of barring the time-traveller out of the local chapter of the Good Ole Boys Club.  The bronze sinks in the air and, rolling a stark left shoulder turn, surges ahead on a newfound thermal straight out of Mario Kart.  Accuracy, now, the stretch of his foreclaws ready for the rend.

The culmination of the evenings party ends as bronze and green connect; Tallailath's rare cry one of surprise and then anticipation as the altered course of her flight finds her in anothers embrace.  Notably not Kaijuth whose hovering tactic fails to win him victory.  It'd instead be Sephiroth's calculated interception that is rewarded with a twine of tail and neck and the burst of jubilant colors in his mind.  Jordan's rhythmic dancing turns stilted, her tempo thrown off by that merging of dragons high above.  Within moments though, baser instincts kick in, orienting her path toward the once outstretched hand.  Ai'den, I'deni and B'ane are all blurs on her way to S'tao, who is greeted with far more familiarity than truly exists.

Swing... and a miss. Apparently the silver-tongued talk wasn't quite so tempting to the femme. Paquith swings about before he plummets into the bowl to leave quite the crash-landing streak, lifting back and angling off. And I'deni? He goes to find that Harper.

Aboleoth functions via a sloppy coast that has him seesawing back to greater precision once he starts flapping again. He's returning to his ledge to devote the remainder of the night to sleeping and catching any number of greens in his dreams.  B'ane, so bound and termined to harass a tailor, shrugs a shoulder to Ai'den, offering a tsst of his tongue.  ""Better luck next him eh?  Good luck with that, S'tao.""  With the energy he has to spare consider the archives re-alphabetized.

Wings flare to check brake neck speed as interception is made and momentum tears Sephiroth and Tallailath through the clustering dragons, carrying them right past the waiting Kaijuth. Too bad a flight is a chase and not a waiting game, no doubt this lesson harshly learned by the younger bronze. There is pulsating flashes, like the gleam off of countless victorious swords flaring through mind as Sephiroth announces his triumph in a thunderous bugle. Down below, the winning makes S'tao's expression flare in a moment of shared glee, then surprise as Jordan comes to him. Truth be told, it has been /turns/ since S'tao has been in this quandry. Hands meet and the wingleader pulls her close for a moment, but his gaze goes past her to undoubtedly enraged Ai'den on the other side."

Great Room (#616LJ)
Not far from the Hold proper, this old flagstone cothold used to creak in some places and crumble in others; it stands solid and whole again, the home and hall of Ista's smiths. This room, the Great Room, with its utilitarian architecture, high ceiling, and broad, swept floor, serves as meeting place, gathering space, classroom, and whatever else it has to be, so long as the purpose can be served by a few scarred tables, some mismatched chairs, the long bench pressed up against the western wall, and whatever else that gets carried in -- if not from outside, then from one of the three workshops, or down from the loft and apprentice dormitory above. Dreary at times, only two little windows and the greenish cast of glows lend their light to the few, dusty red-on-white trimmings that hardly qualify as ""decor.""
An efficient plan cuts a well-traveled diagonal between the base of the northeastern corner's wooden stairwell and the southwesterly-situated Workshop One, while the wide red door (appropriated from an age-old barn) swings to allow passage to and from the Hold. 
You see Galaxy here.

Courtyard Workshop One Loft CraftHeads' Office Grassy Knoll

B'ane picked a lousy day to venture to Smith Hall what, with the thunder and hail pellets. But he and Aboleoth make it safely to the courtyard. Once the bronze lands B'ane enters the Hall proper shaking ice out of his riding jacket while having to serve as center point for gaping smith eyeballs. ""Hi."" Ista's Weyrsecond sends out an introductory monosyllable. It isn't enough to deflect attention.

The moisture hadn't even dried from his hands before addressing a journeyman with silvering hair. ""Hail the size of dragon eggs if you're partial to exaggeration."" Which rose the subject of clutches, feed requirements, hydrophobic metals and a bit on the Hold's misuse of field potash.

Hurrying around a corner and checking himself just after rounding it, Lykane measures the scene. Cleaning around the forge has imprinted the inspiring smell of iron slag in his clothing and hair. He steps into the Great Room with confidence, eager to see his only family. ""Ah so it /is/ true you're Weyrsecond. I had to see the knot to really believe it. Journeyman Kago,"" a chipper resolute nod greets the instructor.

Aware his son may be in the presence of peers B'ane shows Lykane his hand instead of the old-fashioned hug. ""A thing of beauty right? I'm sure someone thinks so. You look good."" A father's eyes have the predisposition to size up offspring after any length of separation long or short. ""How are you?""

With no desire to impede the visit journeyman Kago draws himself out of the chair to leave. ""Good speaking with you, B'ane. Lykane,"" the older man's eyebrow twitches in what's called an 'en guard' display. The apprentice pretends innocence of the whole routine.  Lykane grips the powerful hand, pressing strength of his own into the shake. ""Thank you sir. No new scores for you or Aboleoth? I try to keep up with Falls. Doing well,"" making a gesture to a settee. ""In the top five of my classes.""

""I know. I talked with your instructor. And you forgot you're number six."" B'ane noiselessly sits in which case careful study of the apprentice comes to pass. ""A few scores, not many.""

""I rounded up."" LYkane delivers nonchalantly. He just about mentions something of swinging percentages but gives it the eventual axe. ""How's Aboleoth?"" Waxing solemnly,  ""none of your firelizards made it through did they?"" There's a definitive visual search for his own two males.

B'ane is leaning forward sitting deep in the settee. ""No they never did."" Fond remembrance is spent on the bronze, brown, and gold. ""I'd like to think they went wild and not Between. But Aboleoth's in good shape, he caught a green two sevendays ago.""

""And what's that, his fourth, fifth here?"" Lykane's on the couch's end, right side resting freely on the arm rest.

""Eleventh."" The clarity of that tally is everything. B'ane smiles after Lykane does first.

""No golds though."" Lykane predicts. He reaches for a familiar hand puzzle on a gateleg table.

B'ane's watching the trap of rope and wood pieces in his son's hands. ""No, I keep him on a tight leash."" A whim races over his brain like a touch of static. ""Lemme see that."" After Lykane shares the brain-teaser, ""tell me about your journeyman project. I know you have one and if I know you well you have five or six you're considering."" The quiet stare on the rider's face begs to be disproved.

'There's no pulling wool over his eyes' leaps to Lykane's mind. A quick show of humor and teeth mean he's not lying his way out of this one. ""Let's just say I'll be using a lot of leather and softwood. That's Plan A. Schematics B-F are waiting in the wings like you say, some miscellany of alloys, another variation of the water clock and the glow problem. You know, all the predictable subjects.""

B'ane's knuckles spike while trying to convince a wooden disc to travel through a slot.  ""Yeah?"" Remembering these puzzles expect brains without brawn, his arm relaxes considerably. ""I'd think solving the glow problem would be at the top of your list. The man, or woman, who finds out that crisis will be treated like they drove off the Red Star."" 

No straightforward disagreement comes from the smith. ""Perhaps. But glows are living thing whereas my joy and know-how comes from cold iron, a drawing board, and sharp instruments. I wouldn't know whether to approach a glow from the side or the bottom...""

""You take it out to dinner first then go from there."" String lengths are getting unwound through B'ane's fingers. A metallic ring clicks against a second slot smaller than the first.

Observing his father's 'technique' is Lykane who doesn't yet have the heart to intervene. The lad's accountably grinning from the joke and ventures, ""there just isn't enough revolutionary thought behind self-luminating fungus-""

""Don't say revolutionary around me. I don't like that word."" Claims a groupie of tradition. ""But send for me when you cure Thread."" B'ane's now vividly shaking the tangle of string and objects without inciting frustration signals on his face. Redoubling concentration levels, ""you bring light back to Pern and you'll have the best posting on it. They might even have you running this outpost.""

Lykane tips his head back so he can count rafter beams by twos. ""Just what I need, to be master of two dozen apprentices and journeymen who think they're better than me. Factor in open flames and caustic matter and you've got yourself one fearsome Turns End party.""
A pop means wooden disc one is now a former wooden disc. There's B'ane holding the pieces in his hand looking both awed and victorious. ""I got it.""
 
""You mean you killed it."" Lykane amends fast right before sending a chuckle over the back of his hand. 

B'ane only looks sheepish for a short while. ""Force is a problem-solver. Just look at a hammer."" The defeated remains of the hand game are distributed back onto the low table. 

Lykane studies his father, pinches his chin to a better point and replies, ""I'll have you put that in writing next time I shatter Journeyman Chrissa's hand-blown vials.""

""You're still breaking glass? I thought you were in the top five of your class?""

""Sixth, remember?"" Lykane educates with hoisted eyebrows and a blank expression also about to shatter any second.

The massive smile Lykane's smothering is instead exercised by the Weyrsecond. ""Come see Aboleoth before I go,"" on his feet and clenching a set of shoulder blades under his flight jacket. They're quickly released and the tension with them.

Grateful for that chance the apprentice is first towards the bulky red door and sharing a story of two smiths, a harper, a grudge and a bar fight that occurred in the Broken Staircase where he had no right to be. That overlooked detail, brought up by B'ane, has another story beaded onto it which Lykane tries to regale before the pair leaves."

Kitchens
The kitchen area is large but dim, occupying one of the larger caverns off of the main living area.  The complex scent instantly impresses you - baking bread, fresh klah, roasting meats, the tang of herbs hanging from the rafters. Through the bustling crowd of cooks and drudges, you can see the small alcoves which notch the southern edge of the cavern, some serving as storage rooms for food, and others for general supplies.  One tunnel leads below ground, to a medium sized cold-storage room, lined with ice.  The northern edge of the room houses several immense hearths, spits, and baking ovens, at which the Weyr's food is prepared.  A warming hearth near the entrance to the living cavern always has a meal set out for a rider who might be on an odd schedule, as well as a fresh pot of klah. The eastern wall contains what candidates and drudges affectionately refer to as 'tuber corner' - a series of sinks, the entrance to the dry goods cavern, and a careful arrangement of worktables for food preparation of all kinds.  The cheery room is busy and loud, but you can usually be heard over the general hum of activity.
You see Turnday Cake here.
Obvious exits:
Living Caverns       Supplies       Tunnel

Qylia comes in from the Living Caverns.

Qylia likes the kitchen. There is food in here. It tends to smell rather amazing as well. Hair pulled up into a loose bun, with dark coils trying to win free here and there, the girl is up to her elbows in cooking. Powdered with flower, smudged with lard, and possibly the evidence of a taste of something dribbled down the front of her shirt, Qylia is perched on a stool, mixing away in a bowl. ""Needs more sugar."" Of course. 

Like any metropolis the kitchen never sleeps.  There are always meals to prepare in advance and any results of foresight are never gone to waste.  But there are lulls and this is such a time, a housecall if you will.  B'ane's second breach of the kitchens in a matter of days owes to his communication with the weyrmate of a fallen wingrider.  The cook is a tough cookie but hurting in her own way.  ""Let me know if there's anything I can do.""  The plump woman's response is a kindly hug that contains all her thanks then she's back oiling pans for the morning shift.  Surprised but considerate, the man accepts the display and prepares to leave when a dark-haired girl seems more out of place than he does.  He watches a few a seconds.

It is during those few seconds where Qylia pauses in her stirring, hopping down from that stool and stalking over elsewhere as if she owns the joint. Candied fruit pieces in a rainbow of hues are plunked into a bowl *tink-tink-tinkletink*. Keeping that bowl in hand, she sweeps around, dodging the bus boy, the one with the table rag, and fetching up before a tall, older rider before her path. Flour-dusted, tan fingers come together and then wave before B'ane, ""Excuse me. You are in the way."" Blink-Blink.

B'ane wonders what sort of power this child has to keep the inner Weyr staff from hauling her out by the seat of her skirt and flinging.  It's a mystery he's set to find out.  The bronzerider looks carefully to the left and daintily to the right.  ""No I'm not.""  The busboy is quizzed, ""am I?""  The verdict, with a volley of tiny nods, is yes.  ""Oh.""  Call him guilty.  He asks lowly, ""what are you doing?""  

Qylia looks quite perplexed as she stares up at the rider, her head tilting a touch to the side in puppy-like confusion. ""You are standing right-"" Hazel eyes dart to the boy, then back to B'ane with lifted-brow look somewhat akin to challenge. ""I'm trying to get past you so I can get where I left the sugar. What are you doing?"" Honestly, you can almost hear the rest of that statement being 'besides standing in front of me and asking me silly questions' written upon her face.

B'ane manifests instead as a mobile roadblock, one who sallies right up to the counter where Qylia's mixing bowl rests.  His head bows a few inches to gather a closer look but no closer taste.  ""I was talking to someone now I'm looking at your, this- what are you making?""  It's sniffed.

And what he will smell will certainly be very much sweet and look about the consistency of quick bread batter. ""I'm making bread,"" Qylia responds, frowning with /superiority/ after B'ane with the same sort of look that is often found upon her mother, Tia's, face. She watches him for a couple of breaths, and that look begins to wane, ""You can taste it if you want. I think it needs some more sugar.""

B'ane notices the prism of colors held fast in the batter.  ""Iridescent bread.""  As it seems Nannor's left the kitchen B'ane has no allies remaining but is a lone wolf sort of fellow.  A gob of Qylia's concoction is swiped by a thumb and brought to his tongue.  ""Seems just right to me, I don't take to much sweet things.""  Licking his lips once B'ane's eyes lift to read Qylia.  ""Any chance you're related to Q'luin?""  It's the dark.

Not so dark when there are so many littering the island. Qylia hesitates before reaching for more sugar, for apparently his judgment on her batter does carry some weight. She glances back to the opposite counter, considers, eyebrows knitting together in thought, and then she leaves the sugar be. In the next blink, the girl is bouncing over to climb back up on her stool, and dump yet more candied colors into the batter. You can't go wrong with more fruit. ""What do you like?"" As for the last question, he gets a glance, ""He's my dad. Everyone knows that."" Apparently not everyone.

The parentage of babes doesn't fall under the Weyrsecond's job description but he's uncanny for observations.  ""You have the same cowlick.""  Hey, it's easier to see these things when you're a semi-giant.  ""I like meat and salt.  You know, cooked.""  One of the candied fruit chunks, pineapple perhaps, hits the counter and is totally fair game.  ""Do you do this a lot then?  The cooks seem...oblivious.""

Qylia blinks at B'ane. Her hand immediately comes up, patting flour right upon her dark hair now. ""We do? I... guess I didn't notice."" After a moment, her grin reappears, ""I do this when I want to. Sometimes I do it up in my mom's weyr. She likes to cook too. She makes these really good spiced tuber chips. I could eat bowls and bowls of them. I bet you'd like them too if you had any. Have you? Had any?""

""Clove spice, got any of that?  Cinnamon's good too but has less intensity unless you use a lot of it.""  B'ane takes no more of the dried fruit, those two pieces will last him a sevenday's or so worth of sugar.  ""Had spiced tuber chips?  Never.  Not even from your mom.""  Whomever she is.  B'ane ducks to the level of several compartments stored in the counter.  C'mon clove...

""I put a little cinnamon in it. Not cloves..."" Qylia considers, looking at the batter, frowning slightly in thought, and then glancing aside to where the spices are. But B'ane is already heading in that direction, and so she'll perch and comment back, ""You should. I'll bet she'd send you some to the office. I haven't been in there in awhile. Are you using the same desk? This one time I carved my name in the side to show mom how proud I was about being able to write my name, and it needed to be permanent because she had so many scrolls and slates laying around."" 

The tinkling of glass rolls over the stone floor via a little tube of crushed pepper.  It didn't break like B'ane expected it to.  ""Hm.  Good smith.  I think this is- nope, not it.""  While many vials go unmarked he's using his nose to ferret out the contents.  ""Why do these all look the same.  The Weyrsecond's desk?  That was Tia's before mine.  You- /she's/ your mother?""  His head pops up.  ""You don't act like there's firestone up your...ear.""  

That 'duh' face from earlier? It is back now. ""You can say arse around me,"" Qylia sighs to the spice-seeking rider. Really. Duh. ""I've heard worse."" Beat. ""I've said worse."" She shrugs and goes back to mixing up the batter, stretching a hand out to bring the loaf pan closer. ""Do you want me to tell you what she has said about you?""

""I wasn't going to say arse.."" The confession is witnessed by a whole row of dried cilantro.  ""Wait,"" the man's head is up again like a perseverant prairie dog.  ""She said something about me?""

Qylia just /grins/ back at B'ane. ""Yes."" But there is nothing more to elaborate on, because as soon as that word leaves her mouth, the teen turns back to her batter, reaching in to pluck a batter-coated piece of fruit, and pop it into her mouth. Uncooked poisons be damned. 

B'ane is on his feet and arranging the palms of his hands on the counter as casually as possible.  Then it's a matter of leaning forward a sway or two.  ""What'd she say?""  Both eyebrows jump and hold their position above a set of black-iris eyes.

Qylia glances across to him, and keeps her mouth well and shut. Maybe, just maybe there is a secretive twitch to her lips. ""It isn't for me to say."" Yes, that is most certainly a upturn to her lips.

B'ane is grateful for having raised sons if all girl children were this excruciating.  His eyebrows fall back when he turns slightly to the side.  ""Pretty sure they're all out of clove.""  Which is his way of picking up his toys and leaving the sandbox!"

Kitchens
The kitchen area is large but dim, occupying one of the larger caverns off of the main living area.  The complex scent instantly impresses you - baking bread, fresh klah, roasting meats, the tang of herbs hanging from the rafters. Through the bustling crowd of cooks and drudges, you can see the small alcoves which notch the southern edge of the cavern, some serving as storage rooms for food, and others for general supplies.  One tunnel leads below ground, to a medium sized cold-storage room, lined with ice.  The northern edge of the room houses several immense hearths, spits, and baking ovens, at which the Weyr's food is prepared.  A warming hearth near the entrance to the living cavern always has a meal set out for a rider who might be on an odd schedule, as well as a fresh pot of klah. The eastern wall contains what candidates and drudges affectionately refer to as 'tuber corner' - a series of sinks, the entrance to the dry goods cavern, and a careful arrangement of worktables for food preparation of all kinds.  The cheery room is busy and loud, but you can usually be heard over the general hum of activity.
You see Turnday Cake here.
Orinlatan is here.
Obvious exits:
Living Caverns       Supplies       Tunnel

Lisya comes in from the Living Caverns.

The kitchens are winding down from lunch, which means Orin at least isn't cooking, but that's not preventing them from finding things for him to do. At the moment, the poor lad is elbow deep in greasy pots and dishes. He explicates as a drudge deposits another load, ""Shard it all! I can't wash the thrice-seared things if you keep dumpin' 'em in faster'n I wash 'em!""

Aside from his short stint as a candidate B'ane has trespassed in the kitchens a grand total of twice.  There's that quiet trepidation on his face as the heat of the ovens swell around him and the swallow he does without his mouth totally closed.  ""If you want scraps for 'lizards they're already out front."" A red-haired red-faced woman thinks to clue the lost soul in en route to the stores.  ""Thank you.""  Which comes automatic though that isn't what the Weyrsecond is after.  He looks goalless but is looking closely at everyone.

Orinlatan barely glances up as the Weyrsecond enters. The only indication that he spotted the man at all is that the sandy-haired candidate suddenly goes mum and scrubs industriously. He's workin' hard, yessir yessir!
Orinlatan

B'ane takes strides to two young women invested with individual roll preparations.  No attempt is made to peer at their faces, a quick glance to their fronts and the dragonrider moves on to look over a soup stirrer.  The act, as that's what it is at this point, is repeated from afar to a cauldron buffer, a filleter, and an inept mopper.   ""I knew a candidate once whose hand went right through the pot.  Scrubbed too hard.""  True story or lame humor, B'ane suits either recourse.


""Sir?"" Orin's voice is pure innocence as the bronzeriding wingleader and weyrsecond draws closer and seems to address him. In the course, his hand never stops scrubbing away, though. At least until he stops to rinse the tray and set it aside.

Unusual wanderings seem to be affecting a small number of people. Not only is there the usual traffic in and out, and B'ane 'studying' various kitchen-helpers, but a rather short 'rider ends up wandering in. She makes it that far, due to timing her entrance - behind a trio of servers come to drop off their dishes for Orin - unfortunately, they head that way, and she heads towards the ovens. At least, until one of the cooks sees her. Cutting her off before she can actually make to the danger zone, Lisy has no choice but to change direction. At which time, she spots a familiar duo. A grin appearing, the shortie starts her way over, exaggerated care given to be quiet. In a room full of noise and bustle.

B'ane's dark eyes denote the pan in the candidate's hand.  ""See, the friction caused...never mind.""  His own hands are up and pursuing a quick imitation but stop short.  ""I found this in my meat roll.""  A nickel-sized button made from thick mollusk shell is centered between the man's index finger and thumb.  With his back to Lisya it just may give her an easy element of surprise.

Orinlatan quirks a brow at B'ane, ""How can I never mind what I never knew? Sir."" He takes up the next platter and starts to scrub, scowling as even more dishes are added to his pile. B'ane's a good distraction, Orin doesn't even notice Lisy as his eyes catch on the button, ""I'm not the cook, sir. They don't let me near the food.""

Any thoughts to jump at B'ane or some such, is discarded when Lisya overhears part of the conversation. So, instead, a silver-top head pops up to the side of the two, trying to get a look at this mysterious food-object. ""Was it a candy? I'm knowin' I didn't do it, they won't even let me near the ovens, mean shardin' cooks that they are. Hey, Orin, broke anything yet?"" The words fall, one after each other, in a quick mess of statements, before she looks up. And grins. ""Also, 'ello there.""

""Good point,""  B'ane favors Orinlatan's deduction.  ""It wasn't important, I was lying anyway.""  The button, still retaining the heat of his hand, again gets enclosed in the same fist.  Like a bull in a china shop self-aware of his bulk B'ane sticks close to the side for minimal spacial interference.  He's already tampering with the help.  ""Any particular reason why they don't?""  Idly Orin's fingers are counted for a state of wholeness.  ""Not unless you have a sweeth-tooth for accoutrements,"" the button shown in his palm to Lisya.

Orinlatan smirks slightly as he works on the platter, his foot nudging the bucket beneath him that certainly doesn't happen to contain a half-dozen dropped and broken plates. Of course not. ""I'm not much of a cook, sir. Despite my mother's attempts, I mostly end up with burns and contusions and ruined food."" He grins slightly at Lisya, ""Weyrwoman."" So formal. It must be the vicious white thing clinging to his shoulder, ""What brings you down today? Surely not just to coat me in manure again?""

""Don't make me tackle you into the suds, Ori,"" Lisya 'mock' threatens, the look she gives the suds more considering than many would probably prefer. ""Oooh, that could be bein' interestin' - but buttons aren't very interestin' at the moment. An' you fond that in your food? Blargh. Maybe the cooks should be only wearin' robes, instead of real clothin'?"" The wondering is said out loud, before she bounces a bit. ""I like to be cookin'. /They/ won't let me though.""

B'ane verifies the switching of bread dough from the perfectly browned to the fresh mounds of soon-to-be.  It's very appetite-enhancing.  ""Good call on the cooks' part, none of what you described sounds appetizing and I'm pretty sure that's a requirement in the kitchens.  Like a short temper.""  A pause is tucked in.  ""Congratulations by the way.""  There's indication he means Orin's white knot.  ""I didn't know you had a violent streak in you, Lisya.""  Manure eh?

""Hey, if you're gonna say mean things to me, that means I deserve a hug - paid in advance, please,"" Lisya informs B'ane, before tilting her head at Orin, ""Only last night? That should be happenin' every evenin', Orinlatan. After all, wouldn't be doin' to have dirty Candidates runnin' around. At least, not when they're not compostin' or baggin' firestone.""

Orinlatan smirks slightly, ""Nothing involving me and food prior to serving is ever pretty. I'm told I ruined a whole roast two days ago. So, now I wash."" He waggles the platter indicatively before rinsing it and setting it aside for the candidate who's drying to deal with. ""I've managed to avoid the ladle so far, Faranth only knows how."" He glances at Lisy, ""Please don't. I just bathed last night."" The rest of her commentary draws a surprised blink before he nods again to B'ane, ""Thank you, sir."" <re>

B'ane blinks his gaze from goldrider to candidate, the lingering look to Orin mute for 'is she for real about the hug?' Otherwise the bronzerider is stock still.  ""One ruined roast is the spit canines' banquet.""  Loosely translated to 'sometimes you're the candidate making the Big Mistake and sometimes you're the dog licking his chops'.  ""Been to any egg touchings yet?""

Orinlatan quirks a brow at Lisy, ""Doesn't mean I want two in one day, ma'am."" The ma'am comes with a sly sort of grin before he nods to B'ane. She's serious. Or else she'll accept and either way Orin will have gotten to giggle inside. B'ane's comment draws a smirk and a glance at the spit canines. ""So I'm told. I'm sure they supped well that night."" He glances at the knot again, then shakes his head, ""Haven't gotten t' touch 'em. Got to see 'em before da searched me, though.""

Lisya crosses her arms in front of her, and just stares up at B'ane. Oh, and taps her foot. ""What, you're not likin' me anymore? Or am I bein' too mean to think that Ori should be havin' a bath every day - an' what's wrong with two, anyway? Just means you're extra squeaky clean,"" she adds for Orin, a grin lurking.

Clearly the other two have more of a rapport between them than B'ane does with either, combined.  That, along with the embrace request, has Ista's Weyrsecond living in the land of awkward.  ""I like you fine but, I have this button that needs to be given to one of the cooks.""  Certain vocal inflections claim random words as the button becomes his Calling.  ""I think I see one.""  And halving a glance for the two B'ane detaches from the conversation to indeed beseech one of the head cooks.

Orinlatan just stays out of that one as the two riders contemplate options. Once B'ane starts to move off, though, Orin leans towards Lisy and mutters, ""D'you know how hard it is to find the baths when there aren't people in 'em?""

Lisya pouts at B'ane, ""... I see how it is,"" before turning to Orin, rubbing at an eye, though there's no tears for the Candidate to see. An' why bother waitin' 'til then? Unless you're skinnydippin', it almost never happens!"""

Central Bowl (#876J)
Although Ista is smaller than the other Weyrs, the bowl still stretches over 3000 feet in length. To the north and east, you can see the jagged rock fingers towering thousands of feet above you. On the tip of the most northern finger lay the Star Stones, the heralds of the coming of thread. The Queens' Weyrs and the Hatching Grounds lay to the northeast, while the Weyrling Training Grounds and Barracks lie to the north. To the northwest lies the waterfall, where the weyrlings and full-grown dragons alike are bathed, and the weyrfolk can enjoy a swim.  Due east, you will find both the Living and Lower Caverns, and to the west is the Feeding Corrals and the Plateau on the edge of the Bay. Great gaping maws dot the inner mountainside and occasionally you can see dragons swooping gracefully in and out of their rocky homes.
  It is a summer afternoon.  Scorching summer heat withers people and plants alike.
Darius is here.
Obvious exits:
Eastern Bowl       Southern Bowl       Training Grounds       Feeding Pens (Beach)
         
Darius is doing laps around the bowl.  He's not moving terribly fast, but at a decent clip to make it around several times before he stops.  Every once in awhile he reaches up to wipe his face and then trudges onward again.

Baysweeper is assembled overhead for the rigors of training with their wingsecond at the proverbial helm.  Their wingleader has his destiny combining reports for Q'luin and dodging the strength of the day's sunlight.  Taking a slight break from physical work, B'ane is still trying to dissolve a problem when Darius sprints by.  ""Whatever training you're doing isn't worth dropping dead for.""  From a shelter of shadows he flies a comment to the jogger when he comes close.

Darius saw the shadow, but is surprised at being spoken to.  The jog slows as he nears and he shrugs, leaning onto his knees to catch his breath.  ""I stay pretty hydrated and take breaks along the way.  I should be fine,"" the weyrbrat puffs carefully. ""I'll stop by the lake in that direction and swim to the other side too.""

B'ane cuts a solemn figure but isn't the kind to portray menace outright.  Seeming to remember Darius's face from an earlier encounter,  ""You're the barkeep right?""  Weyrfolk mingle behind the bronzerider but they're more or less a world away.  ""You must be out of your element for a good reason.""  His baritone is a quiet pitch not common for his stature or rank. 

Darius nods, wiping the sweat from his face.  ""Yeah.  Bronzerider Ai'den is training me, so I'm not such a pansy in a fight.""  Riders kind of stand out, especially the weyrsecond, so Darius is quietly respectful, though not fawning.  ""Endurance training.""

B'ane is leaning informally at the door and while Darius talks he cables his arms together in front of his chest: a studying posture.  Ai'den happens to be in Baysweeper where the younger rider is known more intimately than if he were in another Istan wing.  But that isn't shared, for the time being.  ""Do you fight a lot then? I thought it traditional bartenders stop them.""  At least he seems intrigued.

Darius gives a shake of his head.  ""Not really.  I think it's part of the Weyrleader's goal in giving Ai'den horrible tasks or something.  He had this funny smile on his face when Q'luin told him to 'toughen' me up.""  He catches his breath after a moment and moves into the shade since he's not moving now.

""Horrible tasks do seem to be...inherited here."" B'ane finishes the phrase with what might be a pause of solidarity.  ""So while you're getting muscle and the lungs of a runnerbeast, what sort of training is Ai'den providing on strategy and common sense?""  His eyes trail a blooding green dragon but return to Darius after short order. 

Darius leans against the bowl wall and tucks one hand into a pocket at mention of common sense.  ""Well, common sense I'm having to pick up along the way as that seems to be something I don't always do so great on, but training is focusing strictly on the physical at the moment.  Am I supposed to be getting strategy as well?""  A pause.  ""Maybe that's what the firestone thing is about, making Ai'den report to me?""

B'ane's bottom jaw happens to swing left in loose consideration of Darius's reply.  His eyebrows also happen to leap reactively before levelling.  ""Strategy?  Oh that comes easier with common sense.  'Course you need imagination too,"" the man seizes a section of his lower lip before asking,  ""What firestone thing is that?""

Darius gestures up the bowl to the activity by the guard barracks, where new firestone stores are being built.  ""Uh.. 3 bags missing.  Got to move the firestone up there in a secure location and then find out who stole them.""  Weyrleader put me in charge.""  There's a hint of incredulosity about his tone, and the kid just shakes his head.

B'ane's face rarely stages what he's thinking so at this very moment he's playing the devil's advocate.  ""First, don't document it's missing.  When things are 'missing' people presume stolen and they get 'panicky'.""  Fingers extend with the word.  ""Say 'unaccounted for', that way you can play the possibility someone miscounted which could very well be your problem.  If anyone was going to steal firestone they'd take a lot more than three bags and call it a day.""  There's a pause as he reflects.  ""Have you asked the dragons?  They don't lie but their memories are short so make them your first source if you're ever given an abominable mission like this.""   

Darius leans against the wall.  ""Been to records, spoke with the Weyrwoman.  Cross referenced with S'tao and the Weyrlingmaster.  I've also got crafters and a headwoman looking for other possible unacccounted for supplies.  Though so far, it's not a math error.""

B'ane finds solace Aboleoth isn't among the males swarming around the mating green.  ""Could be a people error then.  A rider really used four bags of stone when he said he used three.  Three bags is a fantastic margin of error in a Weyr who easily uses hundreds a Turn.""  From a task B'ane would seethe for its irrelevance, he sympathizes with the young man's position as shown by sloping shoulders and a falling gaze.  ""Remember common sense, hm?""  He seems willing to detach and go back gnawing the gristle from his own problems.  
 
Darius mmm, seeming to agree. ""Yes, a crap job, but one apparently small enough to trust to an untested weyrbrat and a rider who seems to be on the outs with weyr leadership.  I do believe Ai'den is meant to keep an eye on me, keep me out of trouble.""  Though that is likely a failing proposition.

B'ane's arms fall from his front as preemptive steps are taken back into the dim caverns.  ""Or cause it.""  The Weyrsecond sucks on a tooth and leaves Darius alone with his thoughts and sweat stains."

Workroom (#5195DJ)
  A marked difference assaults the senses as soon as one enters this large cavern.  The sheer roominess of it contrasts sharply to the slimmer, winding, inner tunnels of the weyr.  Some ancient lava flow pooled here, eventually carving out a good-sized space put to good use by busy weyr residents.  The ceiling rises surprisingly high, the walls draping with fair smoothness to a well trampled floor - turns of scars and scrapes from boots, chairs, and myriads of other activities marring the surface.  
  Partitions split the room into various sections, all of which are movable depending on the projects at hand.  During the day the room fairly buzzes with activities of every sort - a variable collage of sights, sounds, and smells that changes day by day.
  Type 'look areas' to see the various sections and activities, then 'look' at your selection.
Jordan and Darius are here.
Obvious exits:
Out


Aside from five women taking on mounds of clean laundry to fold, B'ane is one of the men involved in a card game.  Or rather, trying to be.  A girl cresting about four or five turns is beside him, wide-eyed and posing as many questions as a blind man in a bazaar.  ""How come you didn't play the two last time, B'ane?""  A trio of hearty Istans smirk, one ripely laughs.  B'ane, still seated, rolls his jaw and replies evenly, ""it wasn't favorable then."" 

The workroom is not an uncommon place for Jordan to be on any given day, though what had once been a 'once and again' visit has become something more of a fixture for the newly white knotted woman.  She emerges now from a corner of the work area, a basket hitched against her hip. Between the option of folding laundry and mending clean laundry, Jordan has chosen the later.  She aims to find a table that is neither crowded nor dedicated, though her attention is caught by the game of cards and B'ane's side-seat poker partner.  A little twitch colors the corners of her mouth, even as she finds a seat nearby to sit and watch.

Darius comes in somewhat absently, plucking at the juice stains on his shirt.  ""Hey Harrah.."" he calls out before he looks up and realizes she isn't here.  ""Oh, sorry.  Is there a game on?  What's the game?""  He notices Jordan to the side and lifts a hand in greeting her.  ""Hey Jordan.""

B'ane has come to the realization children and gambling are an abominable combination.  ""You could match it with his two... right?""  Dalea points to a beared leatherworker known for his tight stitching and ability to suck Tillek Hold dry during celebrations.  Or any day.  The man retracts the cards to his chest, ""hey!  B'ane, it's all 'n good if she makes you lose but I've got a streak t'keep.""  A third fellow sniffs his nasal passages clean.  The bronzerider, patron saint of small children without knowing it, agrees to recede from the game.  ""Nariun Poker, know it?""  Speaking to Darius,  ""tell you what, you can have my spot and my fifth mark in the center there.  You'll need it, trust me.""  Jordan pulls Dalea closer by some virtue of gravity.  Big brown eyes hop from the woman to the cache of clothes.

Jordan is not a kid person.  Not by a long shot.  But somewhere along the line she'd gained a tolerance for them, some more than others.  Dalea is thusly weighed, Jordan meeting the girl's inquisitive gaze with a small, thin smile.  It soon passes to B'ane, Jordan offering up, ""Ought to teach her how to cheat in your favor.  Maybe cut her in for a little bit of the profit.""  On to Darius' her gaze goes, though only to offer him a silent nod in greeting before she turns her efforts onto putting a dent in her workload.

Darius walks up to the table and shakes his head.  ""Not a clue how to play, but interested.""  He crosses his arms over his chest. ""But if it's going to get deep in the marks, I'll have to call out.  Not many marks to be made as a bartender around here.""

B'ane pays attention to a small group designing lace.  They might as well be arachnids for all their skill.  ""Huh?  Cheat?""  Reserved to his own world for a second, he comes back to Jordan full force, lightly, ""that isn't something I'd be qualified to teach.""   Leegan interjects:  ""You should consider it!  You may actually win.""  B'ane shares in the humor, teasing though it is, with a small shy smile.  To Darius: ""Do you play any games of chance?""  A scrap of clothing, an apron, is handled in front of Dalea and slowly folded in front of the girl.  ""You try.""

""I know a trick or two.  Be willing to lend you the skill... for a mark or two.""  Jordan's offer is more a tease than true offer, though the serious, dead-pan delivery might not suggest as much.  She watches the man teach the girl how to fold, frowns for it, but says nothing.  It'd be awful patronizing of her, after all, given she soon breaks out the mending kit to deal with her first 'in need of repair' item - a shirt; size - large man, age - this side of ancient.

Darius gives a shake of his head. ""No, no games of chance yet, but something a man should definitely know, I think.""  He drops down into a chair, juice stains on his shirt forgotten.  ""Just don't teach her to cheat when he's playing against me,"" he grins at Jordan.  He glances at the laundry mending and then shakes his head.  ""Wow, that's got to be the worst candidate job there is.  Mending.""

B'ane responds to Jordan's proposal of charity with a dark-eyed glance and deepening shadows around his mouth:  a fledgling smile in the right light.  ""I'll keep that in mind.""  The headwoman's assistant is correct B'ane hasn't her dexterity with laundry, but he's a degree or two away from hopeless.  Dalea chatters about knowing how to fold clothes, especially nappies of her little brothers.  ""What do you do with the strings?""  Said apron links are like tenticles to an otherwise tidy square.  ""Blood or tomato?""  Eyes laterally divide Darius with a look, stopping at his midsection stains.

""You do that,""  Jordan, in good spirits, counters B'ane with a remarkably chipper smile.  It sobers quickly, reverting into an unpleasant little half-frown as she's compelled to correct Darius' assumption.  ""Latrines.  That trumps all.""  Jordan looks from Darius to B'ane, seeking confirmation from a man she knows has been there, done that.  If maybe ages upon ages ago.  She threads a needle, ties the thread off and proceeds to eye the shirt with a frown.  ""This is just tedious.  Gotta do it right or they'll send it back.""  More to herself, truly, though open game for either B'ane or Darius if they so cared to pay attention.

""Redfruit,"" Darius smiles crookedly and then glances at the child and doesn't add any details.  ""Mixed with .. mango, I think.  Yeah.  That was a mango."" A glance at Jordan.  ""Latrine.  Yeah, forgot about that one.  I would imagine that is worse, for the stink factor, but I'm not sure I could get those stitches right to save my life, honestly.""

B'ane has run out of things for the little girl and seems to neglect her though he does pay attention to her actions.  He does respond to the chore complaints in an ode to optimism ,  ""C'mon guys, practice.  That's all it takes.  See?""  Advice is depicted by a neatly packaged apron for the kitchen staff.  His 3.5-foot shadow grabs matching socks and bundles them into one.  ""Latrines really were the pits.""  Finally consenting.

""A poet among us.  Will surprises never cease?""  Jordan's taunt is a bit sharper this time, more humored.  ""He's got it though.  Practice makes perfect.  Plus, if you don't learn, you face going naked out onto the sands and that's not something I'd suggest.  Entertaining as it might be, it's not exactly wise.""

Darius grins, turning the chair to sit facing the back as he straddles it.  ""Don't see that in my future, but I wish you luck Jordan.  Not on ending up on the sands naked, but in a dragon, if that is your desire.""  A glance at B'ane's folding and he grins again.  ""Not bad.  Better than I could do likely.  I'm still working on the firestone problem, though and the new storage facilities are almost done.""

B'ane nearly elbows a red-headed woman who wasn't there a second ago.  ""Thank you for watching her, you have my thanks.""  Dalea's hand is taken by her mother and lead out of the work room.  The woman, a total stranger, acquires a humble, ""she was no trouble,"" from the Weyrsecond.  He watches the tot go.  ""Sewing's a must from a dragonrider, from straps to rips.  Not optional.""  Darius mentions firestone, a subject B'ane has words for, but locks them in place for a different day.  ""I'll leave this one to... you.""  An undergarment of unknown origin or symmetry is guided towards Jordan.

""Thanks,"" Non-committal from Jordan to Darius' words of well wishing.  It could be the focus on her sewing, or as is more likely, total avoidance of that subject.  To B'ane, she offers a lopsided smirk - leaving the sewing remark untouched, though soon to nod toward her unattended basket, ""Throw it in there, will you?  I'll get to it.  Eventually.""  Beat, ""Do you often watch others kids, Weyrsecond?  Don't tell me you excelled at sewing and kid-sitting.""

""No, actually,""  Aboleoth's rider reciprocates to Jordan.  ""My flair with a needle only gets me by and I only suppose I was asked to watch that girl was because I look trustworthy.""  The undergarment is deposited by Jordan as recommended.  ""And I was walking by the nursery,"" he admits to himself, now second-guessing his abilities for good - or bad - timing.  ""He work in the kitchen?""  Darius is insinuated because B'ane hasn't been to the Klah Pot in 3/4 of a turn. 

""Yet you played poker with her at your elbow.  I think that trustworthy reputation is about to take a hit,""  Jordan's counter is quick, humored - easily shattered if B'ane so chose.  She looks up from her mending to glance over toward Darius, wondering the answer herself.  ""I don't think so.  Q'luin put him in charge of Ai'den a ways back.  The firestone stuff.  Don't know much else beyond that,"" Because she herself hadn't taken back up her apron at the 'Pot, nor paid much attention to who bartended and who didn't when she did visit the place.

Darius finds a laundress to see to his shirt and comes back shirtless but not caring.  ""Oh yeah, I work in the 'Pot when I'm not hunting firestone issues for Q'luin.  And Ai'den's training me in some physical stuff.  Trying to make me less useless, I guess.""

""That's a full plate,""  B'ane judges Darius for the teenager's workload.  Neither willing to waste time nor assess the Weyr's collective wardrobe, he prepares to withdraw.  That, and Jordan has him pinned and there's no easy rebuttal.  The tall man seems to haunt the card players for a short minute then simply exits plainly and quietly.  B'ane doesn't believe in hellos or farewells.

Let no one doubt Jordan's skills, then.  As B'ane fades into the background, she drops back into her work, focusing not so much on straight stitches so much as getting through her workload as quickly as possible."

High Reaches Great Hall (#6800J)
High Reaches Great Hall isn't an extravagant affair, though it is large. There is no fanfare of arched ceilings painted with a heavenly view of dragons fighting thread. No, this hall was built with one thing foremost in mind: comfort.  A large, cheery blaze is always ablaze in the hearth, warming and bright, with a 'woodpile' to keep it fired. Colorful 'tapestries' ranging in color from vibrant reds and yellows to cozy creams adorn the walls and add to the homely feeling, as do the large leather armchairs and couches. Windows flank each side of the door leading outside, letting in light and fresh air and can be shuttered at the drop of a thread. Long tables with accompanying long 'benches' are to one side of the Hall, to accomodate the eating hoardes during mealtimes.  The room is filled with people, laughter and klah, lots and lots of klah. The Headwoman has scattered 'tables' across the room-- atop waits a supply of wine, 'food' and klah and some serving wenches scurrying around just add to the appeal. So come on in, take a mug, a seat and a footrest and stay awhile.
Klohi is here.
Obvious exits:
Lower Caverns       Outside

Aboleoth and B'ane are introduced to a leaden sky composed of one solid cloud sheet.  The stalwart bronze nearly faulters adapting to the cold, thin air not favorable to aerial beasts, wing beats doubling for the scant seconds it takes to redeem his course.  They land in the courtyard, Aboleoth's head low and perceptive.  Harquith is informed with metallic awareness, << We have come. >> it is a greeting of courteous connotations but like Rome's legions there was never really a place that couldn't be found and conquered.  B'ane bears snow when he enters the Hold and is curious at its atmosphere, that much several curt glances disclose before the hunt truly ends and Klohi's within easy sight.

The greeting alarms far more than it should. Harquith gives a surprised shriek, the sound paired with the silent claxon that has Klohi pushing away from her half eaten meal. ""Shardshardshardshards."" The words spill from her lips, rhythm matching her footfalls and the clicks of her bootheels. Panic makes her clumsy, makes the young woman seek her lifemate rather than a more stealthy escape out back. Heading straight for the main doors, it's no wonder Klohi comes to a squeaking halt inches in front of the very man she's looking to evade. Body twists, looking ready to head right in the other direction, though her feet know when to give up. ""...B'ane."" It comes out as a slow hiss, not enough air or force to manage a squeak.

B'ane understands the homespun ambience without Telgar's trappings or Igen's peregrine customs.  Here, a man can be himself and find comfort in obscurity.  The jacket he's seldom without, one of few mementos from his past and other's future, doesn't have time to be shed when he's face to face with Klohi.  ""This was too easy.""  Glad to be able to pin down the refugee at last yet still a loss to the thrill of the chase.  Casually and seemingly inquisitive, ""where were you headed?""  There's no moving from the door despite it open and emitting a battalion of hard snow pellets.  

Klohi actually narrows her eyes at the man's words, cheeks puffing with defiance as she truly considers making it much, much harder on the man. Her waist twists, as if in agreement and she finally takes one casual step in the opposite direction. ""Heading out."" She answers quickly, finding her voice. Her amber gaze follows his outline, visually prodding for any way around him before another backwards step is taken. ""So... I'll get back to that."" Wherever 'out' is, it's certainly far away from her Wingleader.

B'ane had taken the custom pair of riding googles he owns off soon after landing and they still dangle from his hand, interior collecting snow pellets.  By nature one to loom by height alone there are few times he uses it to any advantage.  Today isn't one of those times either.  ""Not a bad plan, I haven't touched these grounds in some time.  Mind if I join you?""  There, Aboleoth's same civility with no real plan on taking no for any answer ever.  ""Fuu, sure is cold isn't it?""  B'ane seems hardly effected by any weather, hot or cold, so predict it's for Klohi's benefit of asking.

Klohi is thrown for a loop. It's not an exceptionally hard thing to accomplish, but in this case it adds to her paranoia. Harquith is wary as well, ready to leap into the skies the moment her lifemate comes bursting from the doors. ""Join me?"" Outside? In the cold? Where he can whisk her up and back off to Ista? ""...It is cold. So..."" A defeated sigh, hand reaching up to rub at the back of her neck. ""Let's sit down for klah, instead."" And the lecture that she's sure he's just waiting to hit her with. Klohi finally completes the turn, but instead of bolting, she'll walk back towards her plate of pastries. Outside, Harquith senses her bond's defeat and while it's not a good thing, it does mean she can fraternize with Aboleoth without much guilt. As always- that means trying to use the bronze as a snow-umbrella.

""And they say reverse psychology doesn't work. Hnh,""  B'ane dumps the accumulation out of his protective goggles and sees them to a specific pocket within his jacket.  He follows the young greenrider at his own pace and grabbing klah for himself on the way.  He sits on a plank of bench instead of his choice of padded settees.  After a preliminary sample of dark klah,  ""if it isn't the cold that brought you here what did?""  Out of doors Aboleoth adopts a compact posture, neck short and balanced between his shoulders.  He's likely not to mind Harquith's snow-fearing habits or communications, offering some of his own in turn.

Klohi moves swiftly, if only to keep some distance between her and the bronzerider. Despite her pace, the young woman hangs a bit, looking more like a scolded canine than a dragonrider. Even the way she plops onto the bench is pitiful, elbow resting atop the table so her cheek can smoosh against her fist. Looking over at B'ane, she sighs. ""Never been here before."" It's an honest answer, gaze dropping to her plate, picking at the once abandoned sweetroll. ""Don't like it."" Too cold.

B'ane takes in the sight of a passel of children reciting a teaching ballad about generosity.  It distracts him from his fellow wingrider for a moment or two.  ""It isn't bad in summer.  The hills will take your breath away at sunrise.""  Marginally good at small talk at best, the bronzerider fjords the river in proverbial haste.  It's the question that will soon bring him on Klohi's bank.  ""Why'd you run?""

The children bring a squint to Klohi's eyes, and only when they prove their ability to carry a tune does her face smooth itself out. She straightens up in her seat, appetite returning somewhat as there no longer is a ball of stone sitting at the bottom of her belly. More like a pebble. Unfortunately, she's only able to take one bite before the question has her attention snapping right back to B'ane. ""I..."" She mumbles around the mouthful, placing the pastry back down and chewing politely. It also gives her time to think. ""I don't know."" So much for thinking. But then, ""I... felt like I needed to. Or else I'd... I dunno."" Her voice falls to a murmur. ""Keep getting angry 'bout stuff.""

B'ane is no natural mimic but he is fond of repetition on a good day.  ""--Kept getting angry about stuff."" Judgements seem withheld, no direct menace emanating.  The mug of klah in one hand is brought to his mouth, steam yet another moisture addition to the melted drops of water caught in short hair.  Dark eyes rest comfortably on Klohi expecting her to elaborate.
Klohi doesn't seem to want to go down that route, lower lip jutting out in silent protest as he simply echoes her. ""Sure."" She huffs out. Her resolve melts much like the snow in his hair, and she throws up a hand. ""I told you, I dunno. I'd just get..."" Shoulders tense and bunch, symbolising just how she'd get before another long sigh has them relaxing. ""I love Harquith."" The greenrider states what is already obvious. ""But I... don't think I love being a dragonrider. We fight Thread. That's important, I know. But then we come back to the weyr and... what?"" Gloved hand finally drops back to the table, manicured nail picking at the wood as she avoids looking at B'ane. ""What's the point?"" 

B'ane senses time lapse and he responds by edging out his feet under the table heel first.  As a contradiction of reaching the heart of the matter Aboleoth's rider is also a practitioner of patience.  Due time is spent indulging in the next sip of klah though Thread falls tomorrow.  ""You're a dragonrider who's become more dragon than rider.  They're content to sleep, eat, mate and destroy Thread and do the same thing the next day.  That's why riders have weyrmates, children, hobbies, socialization,"" reciting on an everyday tone with little immediate similarities to sermon.  ""What're your rest days like?""

Klohi doesn't quite know if his opinion is an insult or compliment. Harquith tries to reassure her through their bond- after all, how could being compared to a dragon possibly be a bad thing? The young woman is unsure, and instead pulls her own cooling mug of klah closer. When he brings up a rider's life, a somewhap bitter sound crawls from her throat. It's quickly silenced by a sip, shiftily glancing to the side before her eyes settle back on the Wingleader. ""Most of the time, I bake. I train with the guards. Uh. Go to the beach?"" One shoulder rolls in a shrug, ""The usual."" A routine, much like sweeps and Threadfall. ""I have... friends."" She's hesitant, if only slightly. ""Besides, I have Harq."" And that's all a rider is supposed to need.

In the courtyard Aboleoth maneuvers his rear to the wind while waiting like a war mount.  Of course this is accompanied by a vigorous shake of his wings and head.  The umbrella has changed position.  B'ane is silent but conscientious and always thinking, the more stone-faced the better-- or worse.  He believes to know a cure and takes his time about it, intentionally chipping at the cup's glaze.  ""I could use a liaison for the younger riders, and not just Baysweeper.  Q'luin's invented me as Weyrsecond but for my age I haven't known the, this Weyr for that lifetime and I'd rather not be handicapped.  Our circles are different. I could use help to span that gap.""  Eyes research Klohi's body language for her first reactions, ones that might contradict her verbal reply.

Klohi keeps to the silence, preferring it rather than having to think on what she's done and trying to put it to words. The mostly empty cup of klah is nudged away by her fingertips, face fallen and unable to get back up. Harquith is much more versatile, shifting with the much larger bronze to ensure that he's the one getting snowed on- not her. Klohi closes her eyes, looking slightly pained as her exhale carries something of a hum. ""I haven't been a weyrling for a long time."" Tone is defensive, insulted. ""I'm not some kid, even if that's what everyone thinks of me."" The glare meant for B'ane is directed at the table, not bothering to contradict her body language. Young for Klohi may not carry the same meaning that it does for B'ane, however.

""Put it this way, you're closer to a weyrling than I am.""  And there's a small smile haunting his face for that touch of reality.  ""I admit that was my option one, the better of two.  I'll save you from knowing about the other if you accept.""  He knows the mug's empty but kicks it back for the last two drops regardless.  The vessel's studied for a brief passage of time then the man looks up slow earnest.  ""Please."" 

There's another sigh, growl carried on the escaping air... or as close to a growl as she can get. Clearly, she's not terribly comforted by being compared to weyrlings. Being called a dragon was far better. Klohi continues to avoid his gaze, brows still pinched, even as he peppers on the magic word. Her hand balls into a fist, ""I don't even know how to be a liaison."" She whispers, still frustrated. More than likely, she doesn't know what one /is/. ""I... can't come back to Ista. I can't... feel like that again."" There is an unspoken 'Yet', despite the way her lips squeeze into tight lines of flesh. Finally, Klohi looks to catch his gaze, offering a youthful expression that may forgive those for thinking her so naive. ""I don't know what t'do.""

A male drudge is prepared to pass by when B'ane makes the universal sign for I'm-out-of-klah-and-I-don't-want-to-get-up.  The drudge indoubtedly understands, nods, and makes haste.  ""The position calls for someone with an ear for gossip, flat out.  Weyrmates, fights, but most of all opinions.  Leaders play public favor like a harper on strings.  We can know people's minds before they know their own, that sort of thing.  If you can see and hear, you're qualified.""  B'ane thinks to treat Klohi with more intricate responsibility and perhaps with time, trust.  

Not knowing what to do and looking to an older figure for guidance is how people learn. When she doesn't get the answer she's looking for, Klohi's expression slips back into that almost-pout. Honest even when she doesn't mean to be, the greenrider looks less than impressed with the job description. ""Then anyone can do it."" She shoots back, though it's more like a lazy underhanded toss with as much energy as she offers. A sigh, she's comfortable in the fact that he's not going to drag her back. ""I'll think about it. I guess."" Likely not, if that mournful expression is to be taken at face value. ""But I can't go back. Not now. Not..."" Yet. Again, she refuses to say the word, standing to place both hands on the table. ""Thanks for the talk, B'ane. Sir."" Another listless mumble.

B'ane gains a fresh quantity of klah and genuinely gives thanks to the drudge who makes a gesture of respect and retreats back into the kitchen.  ""You won't find it here.""  B'ane confesses with heart, maybe from personal experience.  ""Or Lemos, or the Southern continent, or lower Keroon.  I've looked.  Running from obstacles only makes you trip over the next one.""  This klah, cooler than the first, vanishes quicker.  B'ane steps off the bench and toes it back into place nearer the table.  ""Note I didn't ask anyone, I asked -you-.""  Two empty mugs are his only lasting testiment if not the words spoken to Klohi.  Out of oft custom the Weyrsecond leaves with no deliberate farewell.

>> I bespoke Harquith with: I sense that Aboleoth has enjoyed skimming pleasantries with the young green, might have said so, and delivers plan B when they're in the sky and climbing through grains of ice:  << If she is not there for Fall next day he will bring her back. >>  Perhaps physically carrying dragon and rider to Ista."

Supply Caverns (#12118DJC)
    A short tunnel opens into the cliff face, into a room of sizable proportions.  Barrel, cask, case and  bale are stacked in a colorful panorama of the goods needed and consumed by a busy Weyr. Rows of such, reaching back into the far corners. Shelves, supported by pillars of stone, left just for that purpose, also disappear back into the room and  are piled high with  the fruits of the tithe and the weyrfolk's own labor. While kegs and stone tubs, below, hold food stuffs, grains and dried fruits, dried meats and nuts. All kept safe from tunnel snake predations by the material of their containers. 
    In racks, on the far wall are bolts of cloth and roles of hide of various thicknesses. More of the hide than you'd ever see in a hold. It's for repairing and making harnesses for the dragons. 
    Just inside the door, to the right is a large desk. It's surface is piled high with hides and various papers, a half empty mug holding down one stack.  A quill, dropped here from a busy hand, rests in the dried remains of it's ink, and various odd bits of this and that provide an eclectic bit of decoration along the front edge. 
    Looking left, there's a large shelf holding glow baskets of various sizes, while pegs beneath are for hanging coats, scarves and other gear that might need a temporary, near at hand place.
You see Mossy here.
Tia is here.
Obvious exits:
Bowl       Lower Caverns       Kitchen

B'ane is guilty of rummaging. Oh, and also of stumbling as the coal brazier resting on crates of sundried fish has limited reach.  A lone green firelizard, not bound to him, is currently the bronzerider's only witness but she's not making a pest of herself.  ""Six, seven, eight,"" a barely audible baritone personally marks each grain cannister, big barrels, solid northern oak, that could easily fit a grown man.  Physical details are minimal, the only light source ill prepared to illuminate a Weyr's larder.

Not wishing to show her bruises and batterings to the whole weyr just yet, Tia decided to go hunt for a redfruit to curb her hunger. And thus, finds herself in B'ane's company when she steps into the larder with an overly large lit candle helping her find her way. ""It's for the Headwoman to count our supplies you know."" she murmurs, seeing the burly bronzerider hunched over a barrel trying to count. ""B'ane."" Pause. ""Weyrsecond. B'ane."" There's no malice in her voice, only a faint trace of amusement at their role reversal. 

B'ane did not expect to lord over a monopoly of the storage cavern, but he did expect never to receive trespass from Tia.  His eyes already accustomed to the dark, glad of it in fact, facilitate a semi-long look in her incoming direction.  The candle in her hand makes a large shadow billow from behind him.  ""I don't trust much I can't see for myself.""  Until B'ane can read more of Tia's tone and vocal pitch, he stays more guarded than the fortress he usually is.  ""I almost had something prepared for when I next saw you but decided I deserved to feel horribly awkward.""  Why, he doesn't say.

His confession earns him a barely seen grin, though it turns to a grimace when it actually hurts to smile, and she finds herself rubbing the side of her mouth awkwardly. ""Count yourself a redfruit short then, cause I'm stealing one."" she decides, silent then for an unusually long few seconds. ""You've nothing to feel awkward about. Q'luin made a good choice. You've plenty of experience. And, you aren't one of the long list of women he's treated abominably so he needn't worry about getting another letter like mine. Truthfully, it stings far less to know you have the knot then it would to see many others I know who have ambitions.""

The obligatory darkness is Tia's best friend when it comes to hiding her condition.  B'ane's always felt most confident in little to no light, especially in the Turns succeeding his Threadfall injury.  Considering her pilfering actions, ""now some poor assistant's head will roll when the inventory doesn't add up.  I thought you gave up ruthlessness with the knot?""  The green firelizard seems a patroness of good theater, she's got her neck tucked and blue-based eyes on the human beings.  B'ane's reply is made to sound uninterested.  ""And what makes you think I have no ambitions?""  

""I did. That's why I told you what I was stealing, so that you could adjust the inventory before you leave."" Tia rejoins, laughter threatening in the distance there somewhere. His question about ambitions makes her snort; an unladylike affectation. ""Come on, B'ane. It's me you're talking to. If you have ambitions it's because you strive for perfection. The fact is, you leave every time the Sr. Queen rises to mate. You obviously don't want to be Weyrleader. I'm talking about those who just want power for power's sake. You don't."" 

Now B'ane laughs, a boyish, single-breathed puff.  It doesn't seem like a sound anyone designated as B'ane would make.  ""Already you'd have me corrupt.  But I suppose a month isn't really that much of a record, especially if we were within Bitra's borders.""  He sobers and turns a sack of grist to the light to better read its ribbon label.  ""So much for being opaque.""  He fakes a sigh the green firelizard approves of, talons lifting out of order.  ""Secret's out.  My shoulders feel so much lighter now.""  They wiggle as proof but it's not like his actions are easily seen.  ""How much debauchery do you have left in you?""  It's safe to know he knows of Nerat.

""Oh, come on now. What fun is the knot if you always have to be perfectly responsible with it?"" Tia retorts, her smile showing up in her voice even if the dark hides it on her face. She does, at least, hold up the candle some so that he can see the label he's holding up a bit more clearly. ""Take advantage of a few of the perks while you can, I say. Power is usually only temporary."" A fact she knows first hand. One might find that her expression is all mischeif were they able to see. Yes, he obviously knows about Nerat which makes her try and cough back a laugh. ""My right hook /is/ legendary."" is boasted, while she contemplates the answer. ""I have to say I'm not entirely sure. I'm not as young as I used to be. I've had quite a bit of fun so far. Why do you ask?"" 

B'ane's mouth is parted slightly as he chooses to breathe through it rather than his nose.  The grist is of actual real importance to him other than learning it was grown in Nerat, the same as Tia's facial swelling.  Her take on short-lived power is met with a low rebuttal, ""it's that fact is what helps me sleep at night.""  And now that they're close B'ane follows the candlelight to the wonderland of yellow fushia around the woman's eye.  ""Can't be your dodges are as mythical though, shells.""  And he stares with high eyebrows.  ""Ouch.""

""Hey."" That she can actually pout with her face looking the way it does is probably pretty epic in itself. ""You try dodging when some guy just landed on you and you have to kick him off - and then there was that other guy, and... well, we won't discuss the damages. They're paid for!"" Tia insists, before B'ane can blanch. ""But yeah, hurts like a bitch. If I use numbweed my eye gets all twitchy."" Ahem. ""I think we gave as good as we got though. They had to be dragged out."" Yes, she does consider that something to be proud of.

B'ane monitors Tia's tale with an exterior of quiet serenity much like the green firelizard whose eyes rest on B'ane: the person next in line to say something if order is anything to go by.  Which it is though the bronzerider has seized up or ceased reacting.  ""Must be some story.""  His voice has defeat in it.  ""Well I think I'm done here.""  The firelizard's outer spars flare with effort and she chirps in a strangled way.  How dare the curtains fall already.  As B'ane collects the nearly extinguished brazier in his hand, ""don't lose any sleep over the redfruit."" 

Something in B'ane's tone or reaction causes Tia to place a hand on his shoulder when he straightens from collecting the brazier. ""Are you alright?"" And why she continues with the story is probably anyone's guess. But she does add, with a vague but unseen smile. ""Someone made fun of Rh'iad for the drink he ordered. I have a thing about people mesing with my family."" she states simply, as the catalyst that started it all. ""At any rate, enjoy the rest of your day.""

""Perfectly."" B'ane returns to Tia with some realism.  But which part is lost to either the lack of reflection in his eye surface or the marble-like posture of his jaw.  Here is an expert of keeping emotion sheltered.  A brief glance of the hand doesn't serve him as unsettled.  ""I'm reminded to stay on your good side.  Keep well.""  A singular nod and he moves out from under Tia's hand if it's still there.

""Very well, then."" Tia can meet a cool exterior perfectly well, and she withdraws the hand on his shoulder abruptly. ""I'm reminded not to confide anything to you again."" she rejoins simply, rolling her eyes at the vagaries of old bronzeriders. ""S'what I get for being nice."" she mumbles under her breath when she goes looking for that redfruit to steal. 

A swish of cool air fills in the void that was B'ane."

Star Stones (#2046DJ)
Poised on the fragile precipice of the Istan bowl, here the stoic watchers of the heavens sit their patient guard, fed and clothed by the sea-sprung winds that caper madly about their feet. Across this narrow field worn smooth by time, deep-carved talon marks bear silent testimony to the generations of great dragons that have gathered for the dawn watch.
Far down below, Ista Weyr curves like a rocky diadem in the verdant embrace of the tropical island; the dark maws of individual weyrs rendered small by distance flicker in colorful display, as dragons sweep back and forth like tiny jewels to adorn the uneven crown.
  It is a winter evening.  A cool haze of dampness fogs the frost-chilled air.
You see Ista Weyr DistanceViewer, Tajiath, Einarth, and Aboleoth here.
I'es is here.
Obvious exits:
Fly!

The brilliant colors that color the Pernese skies would be breathtaking, if such things existed. Instead, the Istan winter has still proven true to course with its grays and frost. Anywhere would have been better for this particular meeting, but this is where I'es chose to be for some portion of the evening with one shoulder leaning against the much brighter armored hued dragon that is Einarth. 

Two separately distinct pairs of eyes though their heights and shape differ are buried in cloudscape.  B'ane is reading the skies for the secrets they reserve, the shape of the clouds, the wind direction and tomorrow's weather he can try to portend.  Their combined seemingly inattentive regard for any direction of flight belies the ease which Aboleoth fluently lands.  The station of the bronze's head and neck shows he recognizes Einarth's presence and will not challenge him for it.  B'ane dismounts on the oft side, hidden by his life-mate.

The sound of the rumbled greeting bestowed on the fellow bronze is deep and non-threatened by the arrival of another. In fact, the marked neck which turns slowly in Aboleoth's direction does so with every intention of turning one gently whirling eye upon dragon and still not yet as seen rider. I'es, still contenting with the cold winds at this height, gives his gloves an absent tug before one hand lifts to greet both with a called over, ""Evening!""

If Aboleoth partakes in common talk with Einarth it won't be unheard of.  He takes several steps back before curling a small length of tail around a hind foot for compact security.  He too considers clouds again but no one knows if Bo's got the same sense of foresight as his rider does.  B'ane escapes the dragon's shadow to confront I'es with, ""a good, bad, or regular one?""

""Cold. Whether it's good or bad is still depending on what we talk about,"" I'es replies, glancing about his immediate area to take note of the space that is available and taken. As such, the man remains leaning against Einarth before folding both arms against his chest with an exhale that is neither reflected towards any dragon or rider present. ""The Weyrleaders wanted me to ask you about Klohi, based on a recent talk she and I had.""

""Cold?""  B'ane repeats in disbelief, nearly humored for it too.  ""Vah, this's nothing.  A little clammy on the skin maybe, but dew is good for you.""  Despite no official substantiation from Healer Hall B'ane is resolute.  Dark eyes come away from the sky falling faster than meteors-  it's not a subject the bronzerider was expecting.  ""Oh?  What about?""

I'es amusedly gestures with a few errant fingers in the direction of High Reaches, ""I know. It's colder in that direction, on the mainland. But this is welcomed."" Meaning the cold. As the remark that leads him right back into the previous topic concerning a particular greenrider, he continues with a fading of all humor to inquire, ""Did she tell you anything about taking a.. vacation?""

B'ane vigorously rubs his mouth and the area around it as he pays attention to the question posed to him.  When he folds his arms the leather is slick with tiny beads of condensation from the fog still settling in the Weyr crater.  The hide is now a little prone to squeaking.  He relays to I'es, ""Not a word.  If she isn't hear for tomorrow's Fall it'll be on record and she'll be answering to me.""  An increase in punishment is directly proportional to an increase in rank, or so it seems.

""Short of dragging her back,"" I'es begins, those lines of concern deepening as the fog continues to descend around them to affect person and clothing alike. And dragon, though it doesn't seem to bother Einarth who continues to listen with his attention seemingly turned towards the bowl and the activity below. ""Which, I'm not even sure is possible. Is there anyway to deal with this? Our talk, which was the last one we had before she seems to have packed up and left, left me strongly concerned.""

Control of self and surroundings is the Bible of B'ane, the fundamental pillars that support his psyche and resulting personality.  He preserves it at all costs as a sense of resolute order and when lost it'll be found, or forced if the case warrants.  ""It's possible,""  voice low and unassuming except for the conviction it's made out of.  With work weighing on his mind and pinching his time, the man is brusque.  ""Speak, if you have information about my wingrider.""  

When faced with the necessity of speaking thusly without any embellishment, I'es can and does certainly find himself capable of such with a quick dip of his head in return to the request. ""She seemed stressed. The problem with the glows being a huge part of it. But the seeming necessity to stay closer to the Weyr to help out when possible. All of that on top of our duties from day to day. It doesn't -sound- like enough to make a rider stressed, unless there's something I don't know."" From the undercurrent of the man's voice, it's all too possible. ""But Harquith was just as angry as her rider, naturally. Something isn't right, B'ane. I doubt that she's proddy otherwise, we'd know.""

Two planets and a round of entrepreneuring stars stir out of the dim sky.  B'ane recognizes their familiar positions but can't name any of the celestial bodies.  What ire the Weyrsecond may or may not nourish inside seems irrelevent to his ultimate reaction of nothing.  Face neutral but straight on I'es, he seems to be considering his possibilities of action.  ""I'll see what I can find out,"" with confidence.  ""If you find out anything before hand, I'd be grateful."" 

""I'll try."" Certain of that in voice, though the final results will have to remain between the dragons and their willingness to talk, I'es can and does continue to regard whatever Einarth finds in such a vista below. Only, however, for a little longer before his dark gaze returns to the Weyrsecond in full to explain a little more the reason behind his actions. ""Klohi is usually so cheerful and upbeat. At least, she was during candidacy and weyrlinghood and why... well, I don't want to see her in too much trouble. Even if it can't be avoided when all is said and done, I know that we have a duty and responsibility to carry out. It's your wing and I shouldn't stick my nose in your business. More than I have.""

B'ane's brows crimp briefly as he faces, like Einarth, the bowl.  It's the only partial expression he shares.  His action appears to stem from very little reaction which either makes him seem severly efficient or too passive for those who don't know him.  ""You're a concerned friend, can't fault you for that, I'es.""  A personal touch is incorporated when the younger bronzerider is looked at.  ""We'll leave you two the ledge again.  Take care of 'er.""  Ledge or Klohi? On to Aboleoth B'ane climbs then drives down towards the lower caverns."

Once gloomy and dusty, the records room now reflects a fresh young mind at work. An excess of glowbaskets brighten the room, the fresh scent of someone's perfume lingering in the air. It has a busy feel, with drudges popping in unannounced all the time to tidy up. Shelves grid two walls in perfect diagonals, scrolls rolled and sorted into each notch, different sizes and ribbon colors providing cues to the contents, position in the rack indicating age. The filing system took Telenia turns of work, but it provides a clearcut order and each successive Weyrwoman has been tutored in the code. Two small tables are pushed together to form a desk, but the multitude of hides and other paraphernalia of works-in-progress that cover its surface make it look more like a single piece of furniture. The third wall is dominated by a row of flat shelves supporting a few precious books and well stocked with writing suppiles. A short curve of tunnel provides a buffer between the silent seclusion of this inner cavern and the elements of the Weyrleaders' ledge outside.
Q'luin is here.
Obvious exits:
Out

The new Weyrleader is starting to realize the benefits of his position, namely the one that allows him to summon at will.  A note addressed to B'ane finds its way to the Wingleader via a fleet footed messenger.  It read:  Please come to the records room after dinner.  Q'luin took his meal here amongst the density of knowledge passed down through the ages, so upon the table sits the residual leftovers plus a confusing tangle of knot cords.  Outside the winds whip the daring as ominous clouds aim to drown those who brave the weather for longer than it takes to bisect the bowl. 

It might be the cold rain that's wet on B'ane's short hair but his clothes are a little too neat and his scent a little too clean for having just faced the elements.  The bronzerider hasn't existed that long out of the baths and took no great pride in drying off: there are dark tell-tale spots of moisture absorbed in an off-white tunic.  His entrance into the council chamber is preceded by the sound of metallic-studded boots that don't look quite as tidy as the rest of him.  Having taken a bath instead of a meal, the tall man is prepared not to tell Q'luin.  Head leading his body slightly, ""You wanted to see me.""  Tone's lost the aspect of a question.

The sound of the door cracking open brings Q'luin's inky gaze around to identify the invader. Satisfied, his crunchy voice, still slightly clogged with dairy, lifts to carry behind the chaos outside, ""Yes, come on in.""  A copper hand waves to beckon and direct towards an empty chair.  ""Thank you for coming, Wingleader.""  The formality sits wrong on a shoulder that struggles with the weight.  The consequence is a stretching of the apex of sinew that had bound too tight with the tension, rolling shoulders to dislodge the discomfort.  It'll be casual from now on.  

B'ane has no need to but he flattens a hand over his crown to neaten his drying hair-- it's about half and inch long and pretty much self-maintained.  A slow leg tugs one foot of a chair out to admit enough space for him to sit down, which he does.  Pulling up his waistband idly, ""that's gotta be one of the shortest wingsecond tenures I've seen outside of pregnancy.  Well played on Zhoreth's part.""  Right arm comes to rest on the desk, the other's behind bent at an angle.  He ensures Q'luin will be the first to broach the message behind the meeting.

The tangle of cords is quickly deciphered and a Baysweeper Wingsecond knot comes free to be lobbed in front of the wing's leader.  A humor infused, ""I quit,"" gains the cock of a grin that inflicts crow's feet to crinkle the tattoo.  ""I'm not pregnant either.""  Wouldn't that be a marvel?  A pregnant Weyrleader.  ""Mind if I stay in the wing though?""  The creases remain to mark the mood.  ""I rather enjoyed the idea of the burning of Pern.""  

The tattoo was something B'ane tends to look at more than the Weyrleader's own face out of a sense of rareness.  After he's conscious of that tendency it stops and Q'luin's eyes are met.  The wingsecond knot is grabbed good-naturedly and placed where B'ane can pass it along later.  ""I thought you'd just might as well lead it.""  A passive expression doesn't yield much to read as dark eyes glance where the knot lies at rest.  A little whimsy crosses his baritone, ""We'll save you a hectare or seventeen.  The last burn went without a hitch, but the land was kind of low and wet there to begin with, won't take long for it to rebound.""

""I lead enough already.  A Weyr, infirmaries,"" yes Q'luin did speak plural, but he's leading now via swift supervision in the distances.  That does give him a good lead in though.  ""Wanna trade places?  I seconded you for five minutes; want to second me for a few turns?""  What is left of that cord tangle is exactly that, a Weyrsecond's knot.  The opposite chair across the table gains the presence of a relaxed pair of boots as the Weyrleader stretches out, layering them atop one another whilst monitoring B'ane's expression with a keen gaze.  

B'ane's thumbnail follows a natural groove in the desk wood but his intent isn't to add to the damage.  He reacts as though Q'luin hasn't spoken at first which is a span of about, oh, two full seconds.  Eyes are fixed in place as a quiet breath fills his chest.  Then his other arm joins the top of the desk out of range of Q'luin's feet.  ""I talked with Tia,"" he leans back with a slight bounce.  ""She was in Monaco living it up on the beach, seemed well, I won't say /happy/, but mending.""

The mention of the former Weyrsecond brings out a blanch as the memory of her resignation letter inflicts the present.  ""Tia did S'tao justice.  They were a good pair - team.""  Q'luin's long fingers wring the edge of the desk, knuckles yellowing ever so faintly.  ""When she  - stepped down, she kindly listed a plethora of things I should look for in a Weyrsecond - but the one that resonated was that of them needing to have a respect for me.  Do you?""  The assumption that the Wingleader's former Wingsecond had an increment of his respect has been made as the Weyrleader calmly looks upon B'ane.  

The *knck* *knck* sound is B'ane tapping the third joint of his fingers against the desk top.  He's thinking hard.  ""You're on your way,""  there's no lying there.  ""I get you're a devoted father, good match for Zhoreth, and a sought after dragonhealer.  I wonder mainly if you can really let Igen go.  That's your political weakness, I don't comment on the personal ones but maybe they're one in the same."" 

Bovine steak breath is blown across the time riddled table as B'ane hits upon the one thing that Q'luin really didn't want to deal with.  He'd been shelving that away for as long as possible; not even bringing it out in the light for a brief once over.  Now the new Weyrleader is faced with it head on and for a fraction of an instant does the 'buck in the headlights', only to forcefully cast his dark eyes to thoughtful slits in a heartbeat.  Thoughts conjure, but it is only one that solidifies to words, ""I don't think keeping a tight link to the sequestered Weyr is a bad idea.  Q'ten sees it as having an imbedded spy.  I think of it being the reverse.""  Satisfied, Q'luin goes toothy.  

B'ane brings his hands together to meet and link several fingers while the younger bronzerider talks.  The fingers are creased where they bend and more than a few cuticles contain dirt-  his cleaning regimen didn't get that detailed.  ""Personally I think it's a waste of energy, at least for the time being.  I know your blood is there but your head is too.""  He With No Ties can call these shots and take aim at ancestry.  ""A man with two Weyrs to take up his time is the herder who, eyeing his neighbor's flock, misses the wherries among his own.""  

Q'luin's laughter is richly joyous.  ""I knew I could count on you.  You do blunt so well.""  B'ane is likely right, but for the moment the dark man will cling ever so faintly to Igen, like the fingers that lazily hook on the table's edge.  ""I'll work on that, Weyrsecond.""  It's assumed if he has to give up what he loves, B'ane has to give in too.  The knot is plucked and tossed in one fluid gesture, though this time it will hit the man squarely in the chest.  

B'ane doesn't quite share in Q'luin's mirth but then he's not the object of the mocking maxim.  Mouth corners tick upward then fall back in his usual neutral stance.  ""I happen to like turn of phrase.""  His shoulders work up the chair straighter just after the knot is pitched and sinking limp in his lap.  ""I must be out of my mind,"" as it's turned over in his hand he wonders if this is the same knot that hung off Tia.  ""What's your first order?""  

The knot is mangled, definitely tangled, and looks as if it were a former soggy mess.  So the answer is yes, it was Tia's.  ""If you want a - fresh knot - that would be your first order of business.""  Q'luin won't admit he doesn't really know how one goes about such things since he himself has never worn a knot, and never will.  ""Second would be to decide on if you keep your wing or not. Only you know how much time and - patience you have.""  B'ane should prepare for such casualness throughout his term; the present Weyrleader doesn't abide by formal, especially with those deemed equals.  

B'ane has no motions prepared to place the knot on his shoulder mostly because his flight jacket is hanging in his weyr to dry.  ""I'll stick with this one.  It has stories to tell.""  Or yell.  B'ane's on his feet adroitly having not even moved the chair.  ""Find a new wingsecond or wingleader, I'll still have to sort some weeds from the chaff.  I'll get back to you,"" he commits.  ""Give my regards to Wyn.""  Odds are very high Q'luin will see her before he will.  Very high.

[Ista] B'ane has joined this channel.
[Ista] Klohi launches at B'ane and gnaws on him.
[Ista] Tia: Does he taste like cheesecake? 
[Ista] Klohi: Beefcake.
  
Q'luin lets loose a blatant, ""Aaahhh,"" as he realizes the beauty of the moment, flushing out a grin from behind the safety blind of his title.  ""No, Weyrsecond B'ane, you find another Wingleader or Wingsecond.""  The dusky man reminds from his lax position, ""You asked for an assignment.""  It's a merry game of pass the buck.  He hasn't completely escaped this meeting unscathed though and soberly admits to his next task, ""I'll get go the scissors to work on my ties.""  It's vocalized with the emergence of a pained expression.  Oh how he loves the desert.  

""Be prepared to bleed a little.""  B'ane verses with a nod of recognized detached sympathy.  He leaves the scent of Q'luin's meal to find a plate the equal of his own appetite.  In the hall when he thinks he's got a handle on privacy does B'ane briefly see how the knot hangs on his arm.  It could very well be a noose."

Blue Lagoon
Built to catch even the most mild of breezes, The Blue Lagoon Bar sprawls out on a paradisaical sweep of white sanded beach that is studded with the slender trunks of palm trees whose fronds are woven in to mats that grace the weather beaten wood of the floorboards. The main bar is a long rectangular hut with open walls and a thatched straw roof, partnered with tall stools that look even taller when compared to the cluster of low tables that look out over the picturesque vista.
Obvious exits:
Deserted Beach
Tia is here.

Appearing far more relaxed then she probably has in Turns, Tia's sprawled out in one of those long lounge chairs overlooking the beach and water. A pretty little wrap dress, her hair piled up loosely on her head, and a fruity drink in one hand complete the picture of someone enjoying some serious vacation time. E'siac is nowhere to be seen at the moment, which means he's probably off hunting down either food or provisions or just paling around with Shaarth somewhere for the time being. ""I don't know what's in these, but they are /good/."" she compliments, toasting the bartender. 

B'ane half regrets following M'raaf to the older bluerider's hometown hideaway though he appreciates the other man's barbed humor and absolute honesty.  Most of the time.  The other reason to eschew paradise is the damn unbearable heat that comes with it.  B'ane parted reluctantly with his riding jacket relic, trusting it with a hard look at one of the Blue Lagoon's employees.  ""I don't believe these people sweat.  I've decided they can't.  Who would?  I'd drink all day too!""  M'raaf on the other hand couldn't part with his flight gear fast enough.  The bronzerider, head low for the moment, presents, ""retirement spot perhaps?""  Who should he spot but Tia lounging like a local.  ""Wey-, Tia.""  B'ane's good at the correction, nearly letter perfect.  ""Hello beautiful.  Rum please, and shaved ice if you have it.  No tip if you don't!"" M'raaf settles almost as effortlessly as Tia does.

Oh no. Noooooooooooo no no. Tia is in far too good a mood to deal with people who annoy her. Of course, there is the bright side that she's no longer obligated to be either nice, or diplomatic. Which is why she greets the pair of riders with a bright smile. ""B'ane."" SHe caught that slip, oh yes she did. And it creates an uncomfortable moment of tension in her face before she relaxes again. ""What brings you two out here?"" she wonfers, assuming that M'raaf was not trying to get her to fetch his drink. She lifts up the tropical mix of her own. ""Should try this, it's divine."" 

""That I would water the lawn with.""  M'raaf, balding or balded, chews on a skewer of brine-pickled fish happily addressing the greenrider.  ""Stick to it though, I won't stop ya.  What're you having B'ane?  Don't tell me water or this'll go right in your eye.""  The empty skewer, a sliver of wood, is brandished with probing motions.  Luckily for Tia M'raaf was address the bartender who seems to know the Istan bluerider.  ""I'm his chaperone.""  B'ane poses to Tia with a straight-faced delivery.  ""Please, you act older than /me/ and I'm pushing seventy and heart failure.  I thought bronzeriders had balls, hch?  Naw, I insult you but I like your company as much as Pynsuth's.""  B'ane's shoulder closer to the neck is pinched.  ""Except during mating flights,"" M'raaf amends saucily.  ""Then I like him better.""  Baysweeper's wingleader grins, front teeth visible for a second.  ""What brings you?"" B'ane returns the same question in new form.

Tia watches the way M'raaf manhandles and all but insults B'ane in his congenial sort of way, and can't disguise the slightly bemused smile that curls her lips upward. ""I can well understand why he'd need one."" she jokes, winking at the balding greenrider before she swirls her drink and takes a healthy gulp of it. ""Waste of good alcohol to water a lawn with it."" she points out. ""What brings me? I'm calling it my 'Making up for ten turns of responsibility' vacation. Drinking, gambling, carousing, and having lots of great sex. Ess is fast asleep. I've totally worn him out."" she whispers, leaning over to deliver the flat out lie. But why the hell not! Everything except the wearing him out and sleeping part are totally true. ""I left everything in good order though, so don't give me the stink eye. Just means Q'luin has to get off his ass and find a weyrsecond instead of taking advantage of me doing the job while he puts off the decision."" 

""M'raaf, thanks for asking.""  Said man names himself to no one specifically.  ""Hey, where's your mother these days?  Can't be she has the body of an Igen dancer anymore.""  He ardently reminisces with the bartender, leaving B'ane to ask for fermented fruit syrup of some nature and a separate glass of water.  M'raaf instantly disapproves but engages bartender Lemanik further.  Well, after: ""Waste of good alcohol to cut it with anything other than more alcohol!""  A glass of golden rum is tenderly treated.  ""Good for E'siac, for both of you.""  B'ane eats Tia's lie and doesn't choke on it.  Eyebrows furrow because there's a question he wants to ask and doesn't care for the location or extra company.  ""You look good, like you belong here."" 'Just don't try it' is the part unsaid.  

There's a chuckle for M'raaf. As if Tia doesn't know the name of every rider at Ista already. It'll take awhile to forget all that information. A good, long, while. But there's not even a hint of annoyance in her expression. Just a dimpled smile for the pair of riders. The expression turns quizzical at B'ane's furrowed brow. ""Thank you. I suspect I'll be spending a lot of time here between Falls. Unless S'tao needs me for something. I'm still his wingsecond."" she muses, her eyes darting out towards the horizon and an uncomfortable shift if given in her chair. ""Go ahead. Out with it. You want to ask something. Can I guess?"" This is the gambling bug. One she never got rid of and now feels much more free to indulge in. ""You want to know why I quit, right? Or maybe not why I quit, but why I bugged out of Ista faster then a holder trying to flee a gold flight?""

B'ane uses a thumb to separate tunic fabric away from his neck but otherwise seems secure under the shade.  He's dealt with Ista's humidity for over thirty turns.  He departs from M'raaf's side to get new habitat in a private-style table halfway closer to Tia but neither here nor there.  He'll not force company.  The bronzerider appreciates the cool feeling, however brief, of the slick table under tanned forearms.  Tia's read him well.  ""Why did you leave?""

Tia doesn't seem to have a problem with the company. In fact, she even kicks a chair out so that he knows he's welcome to sit closer if he likes. ""Because I need time to adjust."" she decides, giving it a good moments thought before she really replies. ""I enjoyed my job, and I was pretty good at it too if I do say so myself.  I'd rather not become a bitter former-weyrsecond. And any insult to the way S'tao and I handled things is going to get under my skin. Let Q'luin get the bullshit out of his system and then things will settle."" Which implies that right about that moment is when she'll spend more time at Ista between Falls. ""Or did you mean why I left the position in the first place?"" Now her own brow furrows, hoping she hadn't misunderstood. 

B'ane thanks a server who conveys his drinks to him, the fermented fruit syrup mixed into the glass of water in a very poor i.e. low ratio.  Dark eyes don't miss the chair gesture which means the glasses are taken, one per hand, and walked slowly to the greenrider's position.  ""Both actually.  I didn't figure the transition would be seemless, by their nature they seldom are.""  Shocked B'ane is not, nor does he ever act it.  He drinks thirstily, no quaint sipping here.  M'raaf's noted B'ane's defection but doesn't goad, alcohol calms instead of riles him.

Giving no comment to the odd way B'ane has of drinking as little alcohol as possible (well, odd to her!), Tia proffers a slight smile to him when he takes the seat nearby. ""This doesn't go any further then us, obviously. But I imagine you've seen and heard it all by now."" she muses, paying more atention to the shore now then to the company. ""Q'luin and I have a rocky past. And there are just some things that I can't forget that he's done and said. I can't even begin to tell you how much antagonism and bad blood there's been between he and S'tao either. I'd be throwing away both pride and dignity by working with Q'luin so closely, and I'd feel like I was betraying S'tao on top of it all. Of course..."" now she favors the bronzerider with a wry smirk. ""Should Q'luin fall to his knees and beg me to take my old job back and promise me he'd treat me with the respect and dignity I deserve - and he wouldn't insult S'tao in front of me, I'd certainly consider taking the job back. Alas, that is -neber- going to happen."" She evn finds herself funny enough to chuckle there. 

The trouble with drinking fast is it's a quick sacrifice.  B'ane's exhausted the quantity of water but is satiated enough not to request more for the moment.  ""Not an atypical reaction,"" after listening in to Tia's explanation.  ""But you have heard the expression of keeping your friends close and your enemies closer.""  He recites with a thought to drink right after but isn't keen on slugging back the concentrated fruit puree.  ""If you serve your Weyr first and yourself second.  I think Ista still appreciates your service if that's of any worth.""

""So much easier said then done, my dear bronzerider."" Tia replies, playing with the little paper umbrella that came with her drink now. ""The trouble with keeping my enemies closer in this case, is that I sincerely doubt I could keep my temper in check long enough to refrain from doing bodily harm. Besides..."" her shoulders lift. ""I already handed in my resignation. I explained what he should look for in a 'second, and also why I had to resign. And the reply was.. 'A simple 'I resign' would have sufficed'. So, "" she continues, unable to keep a momentary bit of venom from her voice. ""If our new Weyrleader didn't appreciate my service, that's really all that matters when it comes to his selection. But I do thank you for the sentiment. It means a lot."" is admitted. 

B'ane commits himself to nodding twice, simple actions that don't waste profuse energy.  A glance gathers M'raaf who is more than half through his third serving of rich rum.  Or maybe it's fourth.  B'ane gets concerned the less he hears the bluerider talking.  He replies starkly, ""sure.""  And bows his head to look at the exact hue of the glass for the first time.  ""My regards to Kyraceth,"" the out of place wingleader stands on a whim.  ""You must be about ready to find E'siac again, I'm going back to babysitting.""  A jerk of his head is designed for M'gaaf who's looking very slumped.  B'ane's regress is otherwise ordinary and the rum he slides away from M'raaf predictable.  

""Good luck with that."" Tia's gesture is towards M'raaf when B'ane stands to go back to his other job. Restoring some pride to the ex-weyrsecond, and babysitting a sotted bluerider. What fun jobs! ""My regards to Aboleoth."" she adds, smiling before she downs the rest of her drink and stands as well. ""Ess is probably lost by now. I do believe you're right and I'll have to hunt him down."" There's a thread of affection in her voice then before she salutes the Wingleader and saunters off herself. ""Thank you, B'ane."" is called out over her shoulder. 

B'ane marks Tia with a similar salute in the silent spirit of tribute.  Then it's up to him to locate a cot for the temporarily out-of-commission bluerider."

Garden Terrace (#2006J)
This lovely garden terrace provides an atmosphere of calm and conviviality.  Round tables and bentwood chairs are grouped in intimate clusters, arranged for a good view of the Fort hillsides  During the day, leafy bushes provide a canopy of shade; at night, the glowlights from within provide gentle lighting.   A low stone wall borders the terrace; a gap marks the beginning of a wide staircase that leads down to the Fort River.  Kitchen helpers frequently thread their way between the tables, offering food and drink for reasonable prices.
  It is a fall evening. 
Obvious exits:
Inside the Dragon Inn       River

Lisya comes out to the Garden Terrace.

The air has some bite to it in the breeze that crops up from the valley, following the channel and leaving an impression on the Hold.  But it seems downright balmy to Fort locals who, as long as they have the sun, don't curse the weather.  It's a fairly quiet night as far as patron population goes, a hale dozen or so in number.  There's a harper with gray in her long hair making pretty noise from a large harp.  Alone at a small table B'ane is facing her and attentive, one hand overlapping the fist under his mouth.  Aboleoth is playing nice with native herd beasts, merely eyeing the stock.  Maybe grading them to A and B cuts.

A bite to the air can mean so many things - especially depending on who is asked. For those local, it can be quite nice. For a rider from Ista, well.. Lisya presents quite the picture to those at the Inn. Having been dressed for an evening of starwatching on the beach, she is rather sandy, hair windblown, and missing shoes. However, that's enough enough to stop the 'rider from coming in and reqesting a glass and a place to relax. Meliaith on the other hand, finds a place to lounge outside, a mild rumble of complaint heard. 

B'ane isn't the only person braving a drop in temperature since the barrier of tall bushes and semi-trees sustain a nice pocket of air until the Inn closes its terrace completely off for winter.  As with most areas of Pern Fort's enduring the short supply of glows with two oil lamps.  The glow isn't harsh and preferable to the Istan bronzerider.  Lisya only gets a glance at first until she's placed as a fellow refugee.  Hands come away from his mouth to disclose: ""Last I knew Sephiroth was in the lead."" 

Lisya starts a moment, then offers a bit of a grin. ""Not such a big surprise, that. Aboleoth not interested?"" she asks, before grabbing a chair to pull out, or over, to the small table. Sort of slumping into her seat, there's a bit of a yawn, before she admits, ""I'd been takin' a bit of a doze, when it all started."" There's a pause, then she asks, ""If it's not bein' an imposition?""

From the pens a bronze coos coarsely, nothing melodic to it at all though that is perhaps an unpredictable charm.  ""Of course not,"" from under the table B'ane retracts his legs and heels them under his square-backed chair, making required room for the goldrider.  His head lightly shakes, contradictory.  ""Aboleoth's blood's running hot like all the other bronzes are.  I came here before mine did and I still had the will to cool his.""  Verily his actions are few, slow, and natural.  Aboleoth is perhaps the most natural and true to form as he approaches Meliaith for a sniff of her hide should she allow such proximity.  ""I'm glad you had the sense to leave though.""  A compliment perhaps.

""It's one of the things beat in,"" Lisya lifts up her hand to rap lightly on her own skull. ""One goes up, the rest are gettin' away. The fact that I'd more scrolls to go over, well, those'll still be there in a day or so, yes?"" There's a bit of a grin, before she turns to gain a bit of attention - enough to request a glass of something light to drink. That done, she turns back. ""I've only visited here once or twice. Good place to be visitin'?""

<i>>> I bespoke Meliaith with: I sense that Aboleoth's question darts quick as an assassion's blade but less unpleasant.  As ever each syllable has a minute echo, notes that stack upon themselves.  << Are you here also against your will? >> <<</i>

The harpist lengthens the stroke of her fingers of this song, extending its pace to winding.  ""Good you had that much training.  I realize it's one of the first things a gold weyrling learns but sometimes a fact a goldrider is lax on.""  B'ane's spiced cider, once hot, is now a cold reminder of the surroundings.  ""I'm new here too actually, but I like it.  It's quaint.  Relaxing without being dull which is a fine line to learn,"" he should know.  ""You're not dressed very well."" The obvious is stated as his mug is shaked to determine its level of consumption.  

<i>>> I sense that Meliaith's response is calm, a hint of merry running over past irritants, << I was comfortable near the water. The sand was still warm. It is not too cold here, however. >> <<</i>

""I think m'shoes are still out on the beach - given the roarin' goin' on, wasn't gonna risk dragons in the air when we were goin' between - an' this was bein' the first place that came to mind that'd be bein' far enough away."" A slight bit of breeze has her pulling hair down over her neck a bit, ""Plus, gettin' her to come here /after/ the weather turn is often more trouble than it's bein' worth. An' goin' to the Weyr, well.."" Those sandy feet of hers get a rueful look.

<i>>> I bespoke Meliaith with: I sense that Aboleoth's voice rusts over.  << You can be comfortable here. >>  He extends his wings at the shoulder, showing their size once a claw base is itched with side of his snout.  Someone's showing off. <<</i>

It's the self-extinguishing of one of the lamps that spurs B'ane's suggestion since now it's duly dark.  ""Why don't we go inside, I know I could trade this in for a warm one.  Hot cider, you like?""  He asks in a hurry after his seat is gently vacated.  ""There's no need for you to be homeless -and- cold.""  A few steps are taken for the door then his half-open riding jacket pulled down to satisfy appearance and habit.

""Somethin' to warm me up would actually be bein' just lovely. Always forget how much difference there's bein' - really - until I get to somewhere without my shoes,"" Lisya admits as she gets to her feet.

""True enough.""  B'ane casually replies but with a small grin for the angle of the Inn entrance.  ""I know Aboleoth's trying to curry Meliaith's favor out there and just so she knows he can handle the rebuke.""  Isyth's power, despite the distance between them, is still conducted through the bronze.  Once inside B'ane requests two hot ciders and prepares to carry on the conversation however long in the evening the flight lasts.  Aboleoth does the exact same."

The Beach! (#532J)
This thin strip of cozy sand lines the southwestern rim of the Weyr, leading from the cave-in northward almost to the fence of the feeding pens, where the lake carves out some water for the herdbeasts.  Cliff to one side, water to the other, there's no direct Bowl access other than by air or through the lake itself; thus, particularly in colder weather, it's often a good, quiet place to think.  In warmer weather, however, relaxing (and drying off) on the beach proves to be a delightful pastime, serenaded by the assorted bugles and splashes of dragonkin revelling in the lake.  At the end opposite the herdbeasts, the sand becomes a little grassy, with even a clump here and there.   Some interpid weyrfolk have chipped out handholds in the rock, where cliff meets water, angling up and up again above the lake.
  It is a summer midmorning.  Poofy white clouds adorn the bluer-than-thou skies.
You see Orlaith and Aboleoth here.
Iona is here.
Obvious exits:
Lake

Visitors are in Fort Weyr, but don't call them delegates.  A bronze, traditionally sized and in his prime is at the local lake quenching a dragon-sized thirst.  The first two legs of his are planted firmly, submerged to the elbow.  Aboleoth is skimming the surface of the water where the water is cleaner and there is more cause to feel it rush between his teeth.  There's a man nearby the beast, tall, shorn-haired with goggles in place.  He's the one skittering rocks over the rest of the lake.  

Orlaith likes home-grown bronzes little and foreign ones decidedly less, and thus does not even bother to give so much as a warning, let alone a greeting, as she plunges into the lake, sending ripples out to shore in all directions. That much accomplished, she submerges herself, a good long soak after the rigours of flying. It's several minutes before Iona turns up, a little sweaty and breathless in a sleeveless top and old torn trous, finishing her run and leaning over for a moment with her hands on her knees, nothing so far to link her to the gold in the lake except that she, also, takes little notice of anyone else around her. 

Orlaith's wake washes as high as Aboleoth's shoulders, not quite endangering the durability of thick riding straps.  He didn't come to bathe nor lock a dragon or three into some conference.  But the Istan-shelled bronze is predisposed to brusque greetings at least which manifest as subsonic pulses too low in decibels to bother humankind.  But they never fail to be felt in the marrow.  B'ane takes the necessary steps back to not wet his boots from the row of waves bound for the shore on all sides.  He takes notice of free space away from Orlaith and hurls a rock straight at the waves, ricochet points.  It's enough play to detract from Iona's presence. 

Orlaith is only audible as a wave of crackling static, repelling conversation from either side. At least it's an acknowledgement. Iona pushes her hair back with both hands and moves to crouch down by the edge of the lake, cupping up water to wash her face and take a drink of her own. It's a more surreptitious position from which to observe the visiting bronze and rider, and no doubt to try to place them (Orlaith being no help on this score). ""Don't throw them /all/ in,"" she cautions. ""Or there'll be no lake left.""

B'ane's world is a shade of deep blue so long as he leaves his goggles on so Iona comes into focus in cool aquamarine.  ""I haven't the arm strength or the willpower for that,""  baritone comes out fleecy, not the booming his size might lean toward.  His mouth is a notch above neutral, slightly parted, and not putoffish.  ""That was quite a splash she made hm- did you see it?""  There's no equating Iona belongs to the gold or vice versa.

""Can't be that bad then,"" Iona decides, somewhat cheekily, rosy-cheeked and about as un-aquamarine as a person possibly could be, outside of goggles. She throws another handful of water over her hair and squats back on her heels. ""Oh,"" she says carelessly, barely sparing the gold a glance, ""She wasn't even /trying/.""

""If I didn't know any better you've either been doing some intense physical activity, running for your life, or... you've been allowing someone to pinch your cheeks far too much.""  A blue tint isn't enough to inhibit the observant.  ""She's yours then?  Hm.  See, this would be where Weyr studies would allow me your name.  I used to know Fort's Weyrwoman as Medoba once.""  Or she will be the senior goldrider in a century give or take.  Looking expressly at the goldrider(?):  ""I'm B'ane and,"" forcing a finger, ""Aboleoth.""  Thirst slaked, the latter has retreated to dry land, silver-studded wings parted slightly to grab sunlight.

""Or possibly both or all of them,"" Iona agrees evenly, before giving the bronzerider a faintly puzzled look. She starts to say (since she has done her studies) ""No you didn't, we haven't had..."" before he gives his name and that, apparently, she has heard before. She straightens up to standing, and her tone is suddenly a lot more on edge, even if the ""Well met,"" are the right words. She doesn't jump in to give her name back.

Seeing as Aboleoth is done drinking, his rider does the same visual assessment he's done for thirty-seven Turns and counting.  The bronze is stretching his neck, rocking his head back and forth on its axis.  B'ane, not having had the leisure for youthful activities in some time, swipes another stone from the shore, his third choice actually, and skips it five or six times.  ""Likewise.""  It isn't his personal best but it's a lake with a big dragon in it and his arm is withholding excessive torque.

""So what brings you to Fort?"" Skipping stones is something Iona's never had the patience to learn to do properly; she doesn't show any sign of starting now. Orlaith wades gently in the lake, sending out her own more peaceful set of ripples. She's loitering. ""All early in the morning. There's more than one lake on Pern to throw stones at, surely.""

Aboleoth's head shaking shimmies down the column of his neck, continues through the blades of his wings and is spun by the short length of tail.  Standing, there's a hind foot that is given respite from his weight, the remaining three taking up the cause.  ""Three seas and all sorts of bays too.  My ambitions are pretty small though.""  Hands are cleaned on the sides of his legs.  ""A copy of a report one of my subordinates failed to give me when he spent some time exchanged here.  Or I lost it.  I never did find it... you have a name, goldrider?""  B'ane poses pruriently.

""Several."" Iona's a little all over the place this morning, mood already moved through curious and suspicious, and now she's merely flippant. ""Can't say your report's going to come to light from the bottom of the lake. Water isn't /really/ kind to hidework. Perhaps you /have/ just lost it."" That could easily enough be taken as rude. ""What type of report would it be, exactly?"" She relents, just a little. ""Since that's Orlaith, I'm Iona, and I do know my way around the Records Room at the very least.""

B'ane grins on reflex upon finding the report ground into Fort Weyr's lake.  ""I already got the copy,"" left hand pats his chest and where the report lies tucked.  ""He almost got a write-up for a fight with another rider so I need to educate myself on the specifics.""  Head turning to Iona again, ""Thanks for the offer,""  sounding blandly sincere.  ""This bit of juvenile behavior started out once Aboleoth decided he needed to fill his gullet.  I can't pass time idly, personal flaw maybe.""  Not to him at least, but he's repeating public opinion.  ""But I should be getting back to the island."" 

""Skipping stones counts as idle enough, wouldn't you say?"" Iona is clearly filing away specifics in her head, since she'll be off to check that B'ane hasn't removed the /only/ copy of events. ""Fighting's idle behaviour too, sometimes."" She doesn't seem to be in any hurry to delay his leaving. ""Must be nearly lunchtime there.""

<i>>> I sense that Orlaith is occasionally consumed by curiosity, more often by impatience. >> I do not see/sense how bronzes from other whens are any worse than any other bronzes/males/browns. What is it that makes you so?  <<</i>

B'ane mulls over Iona's thoughts as he applies and overlaps them along his own feelings.  ""Those are more like a... reaction to being idle.  Doing nothing is as idle as it gets.  But at least neither of our positions allow us to speculate too much- thank Faranth.""  Had it gone much more philosophical they both would regret it.  ""More or less,""  the wingleader often skips meals so he measures time in a different fashion.  ""Pleasure, Iona.""  B'ane dispatches over a shoulder as he pulls himself up to sitting on his life-mate.  Aboleoth is pausing to reply to Orlaith.

<i>>> I bespoke Orlaith with: I sense that Aboleoth appears to abstain from reply until he borrows and inserts the snapping of a banner in the wind.  << You can believe they are no better either. >>  Unique, his mental voice vibrates in self-echo, syllables paired with their mirror image milliseconds apart.  << Good day, female. >>   <<</i>

Iona speculates far too much; she does not, however, admit to this. ""Greetings to Ista and her Queens,"" she replies, her mind already half-taken up with trying to persuade Orlaith out of the lake. The gold, recalcitrant, doesn't divulge her brief conversation, nor stir so much as a talon to move, until the bronze is long gone.

His rider secured, Aboleoth springs into the headwind without wings fully expanded until it's clear he'll fall.  In that balance of gravity and lift he beats his wings to a height beyond what's suited for ::between:: then is temporarily lost to it."

Living Cavern (#2070J)
This is the vaulted, high-ceilinged main gathering area of Ista Weyr, where riders, residents and drudges congregate to socialize and make merry. Or even just to eat. Long, sturdy tables fill most of the cavern in neat rows, two of them hemming about the hearths that line the northeastern curve of the cavern. Sideboards by the kitchen entrance groan beneath a constant burden of food and drinks, kept fresh by the cooks and lower caverns staff.
If one were to 'look menu', they'd see what the cooks are serving up as a meal.
You see Lori and Ut here.
Thevaryn and Wyn are here.
Obvious exits:
Bowl       Kitchen       Lower Caverns

Lisya enters from the Weyr's bowl, outside.

""When it comes to owning a small share of a highly skilled persons' work, I do."" Although many things can be said about the frigid woman of Ista, that she lacks a distinct respect for crafts and thoses that produce all the various items therein is not among them. She holds within her carriage a great deal of respect for such individuals and doesn't hesitate to show in the least. ""That is too bad then, for I had hoped to show you something. Next time perhaps?"" And this gets levied with no hidden amount of weight, pale eyes landing on Thev with a direct, near subtule... request. 

Supper beckons to a bronzerider with an empty stomach to remedy.  The breeze on his heels carries broken seed pods into the caverns where, losing their impetus, they're trod underfoot.  He's willing to hold the door open for people engrossed in conversation about sea levels and anyone else willing to capitalize on hospitality.

Magnanimously, Thevaryn says, ""If you are happy with your purchase, then I certainly have no cause for complaint.  Congratulations are in order twice over, in that case.""  She almost has him hooked with the offer to show him something, the fish nibbling at the bait, but he rises before the snare really sets, dangling fingers finding the pack at his feet and drawing it over one arm, hitching it up to his shoulder.  ""Perhaps,"" he answers smoothly, the faint grin giving away the lie, where perhaps mostly means certainly!  ""Enjoy your day.""  His beckons him outdoors, jogging off as if he could make up for the squandered time.

Lisya takes advantage of B'ane's good nature, slipping in with others dicussing a myraid amount of things. Tilting her head to one side, she offers the bronzer a bright smile, and a 'thanks' as she does so, before pausing just past the entrance to look about. 

Suddenly B'ane, absorbing some detail at one of the many table lengths, turns to Lisya, compelled.  Thoroughly.  ""The honor's mine.  Really,"" he angles himself nearly blocking the goldrider's path, though not consciously so, back to the fray of the populace.  ""What a day we're having today, huh?""  He's patently trying to avoid someone which makes Lisya, for the moment, unavoidable to him.  His usual rigid use of titles flies out the window.  He's a desperate man.

Wyn was just getting up. No, really. Package in hand and an empty mug by her side. There is a glance to the departing Trader and subsequent brow raising as his singular presence is replaced by that of both Lisya and B'ane. ""Well now. Fancy meeting you two here."" There's an odd air around her, jovial perhaps but thoughtful too, especially when she's regarding, ""B'ane."" Maybe that man is getting a little bit extra on the cool-eyed look. 

Lisya grins up at B'ane, ""Haven't the slighest, though I've noticed that the greenhouse was picked over - so at the very least, fresh greens an' the like are a certainty! An' it's bein' a perfect day, I'm thinkin'. Meli was wantin' to greet the dawn, all day long, but luckly for all, we had other duties to be doin'."" The grin fades no little bit, as Wyn appears. More formally, rather opposite her habit, ""I hope her morning greetings did not disturb you or Isyth, Weyrwoman?""

Though the woman B'ane's trying to buck ends in -etta, Wyn is often just as dodge-worthy.  But two goldriders are as good as barbed wire in keeping people at bay, so the Wingleader embraces fortune when he has it.  ""Wonderful idea, that greenhouse huh?  I recommend a spot by the lake if you get the chance,"" to Lisya B'ane is forthcoming.  Wyn... ""Weyrwoman, how unwinds your day?""  Not so much.

""Oh, unwinding in a crazy mess as always. Shock a bronzerider, startle a Trader, fill a crafter's coiffers. The usual."" She might just be serious too. ""And you B'ane? I haven't had the good graces to enjoy your company in a little while. Duties been keeping you /that/ busy?"" And yes, she did notice the odd little glances. ""No, no and if she was bothering us Lisya, I am quite sure Isyth would have shushed her."" Shifting from her own stance, Wyn also seems to be making departing motions - glance shot towards the exit to the bowl and beyond. 
""Oh, well, that's good to hear,"" Lisya starts, then pauses a moment. She shakes her head slightly, then offers B'ane a faint smile. ""I'm thinkin' it's one of my favorite places - but the lake's another, especially durin' the changin' time, day an' night.""

""Busy enough,"" B'ane eases his bulk out of the way of a teen looking for cream to top on squares of raw fruit.  ""A Windjammer unit is almost finished with a new levy in the Hold.""  The old newbie labor trick for those most recently graduated.  ""So that's the dragon I woke up to,""  enlightened about Meliaith.  ""Carries better than a cock's crow.""  Despite Wyn's evasive glances, he injects regardless to each woman, ""could I join your company?""

""You can join Lisya's company, I have some things I need to attend to unfortunately."" There is a bright enough smile for both though as she's makes her way out. ""Oh, Lisya - don't forget about those reports and the tithing count either."" Now that that's done, B'ane gets one more glance. ""A levy at the Hold?"" Well now. But then she's off and running and all before she can tell Lisya all about her family. Oh darn. 

Lisya's gaze goes vacant for a moment, before she shakes her head and grins at B'ane. ""I talk a lot - be warned, eh?"" To Wyn, she nods, ""A'course. Anything else I'm needin' to make sure gets done.. soonish?""

B'ane is either humbled or relieved.  His reaction to Wyn's polite refusal is a light nod and preemptive strike at some grilled fish.  When his plate peaks at several inches high, the time-hopping bronzerider sits closest to Lisya without regard to orientation of the room.  ""And I've been accused of not talking enough.  Somehow then we make a full person.""  And thus, he eats readily without waiting for the lady of the table. 

Lisya doesn't immediately respond, just staring after Wyn. Surprise is formost, then - once she turns to her plate - anger simmers. ""... we have too many bronzers at the moment. I think I shall be breakin' legs. How's the fish?"" she then adds, apparently settling into her own meal with gusto.

B'ane isn't offended enough to put a pause in chewing.  In fact, he doesn't consider himself a part of Lisya's problem - whatever it is.  Underneath the table long legs retract to the bench under him.  Just in case.  ""They harassing you?""  Posed mildly as his act of devouring continues to manifest.  ""Tastes... like fish.""  He announces without much creativity - or maybe he's not taking the time to taste.  The din collapses when a drudge trips and lands on the floor, but resumes even before it's ascertained he's not hurt.

""No... wait, yes! They are hidin', an' when I get m'hands on him, well..."" Lisya is distracted from her threat by the drudge trips. She waits to see him back on his feet, before she tilts her head again, rubbing her cheek against the air. ""... what kind of fish? Hm... a fish bake. That might be rather tasty. But so's the roastbeast.""

B'ane is civilized enough to use a napkin when the need calls for it, and without the dire necessity of a stream of broth.  ""I'd guess some sort of shoal fish, not the cold water type that's a given.""  An even-keeled baritone poses lightly, ""with threat of broken limbs, I think they're justified in hiding.  Who's him?  I'll bite.  And go with the roastbeast."" 

Lisya starts to answer before thinking, though the brain does engage a bit late, ""That no-good, tall meanie of a b.... er,"" She takes a moment to blow out a breath. ""He's probably not even bein' aware of needin' to hide. Just bein' a jerk. An' I probably won't get m'hands on him. His shins, on the other hand... oh yes... I'll be gettin' his shins.""

B'ane, as a realist, has little solidarity with his kind.  They are often deserving of shattered shins on more than one occasion, but he's resigned voluntarily not to be the shatterer.  ""The Weyr must be rife with tall meanies,"" no doubt he's registered her height.  ""You'll have your work cut out for you.""  Ahem.  He is the picture of calm innocence.  

""... that isn't a joke about m'height is it?"" Lisya asks suspiciously, though her lips twitch. Especially as it is probably about her lack of height. ""Oh well. I'll get Mel to corner him. No escape then!"" There is a pause, then she pees up at the bronzer. ""Shoal fish?""

Halfway done his plate, the dark-eyed bronzerider's eating stride doesn't break.  ""Yes, it was.  Sorry.""  And he sounds about half so.  ""Lisya, right?  You come from the Hold.  I hear you mentioned when I'm down there sometimes and yes, it's on good terms.""  He could be lying, who knows.  ""Shoal fish... the ones that swim in large groups usually around shallows.  Ever fish before?""

""Not more than as a way to be duckin' duty back when I was runnin' messages."" There is a pause, then she asks, ""Everyone doin' well? Lord Holder, Steward, an' all the rest?"" A shoulder is lifted, the one she tilted towards earlier, causing a squack from under her hair. ""Never really caught anything though. Better to be movin' 'bout, than sittin' still.""

A quick current of air above his head has B'ane sliding a hand over the top of his short hair in natural reaction.  ""Seem to be though I don't usually see Sterling himself.  Joseph's a good capable go-to man.  So he's really your father?""  A quick bite has him clarifying with his mouth partially full, ""Sterling, I mean.""

Lisya winces a bit. ""Well... I doubt he'd have been goin' 'round tellin' his brother's daughter was his if he wasn't,"" she offers, a bit darkly, memories shading her gaze for a moment, before shaking her head. ""Uncle Joseph knows just about any an' everythin' 'bout the Hold,"" she agrees.

B'ane's second plate is a carbon copy of the first:  a Lord Holder's ransom in marinaded meat.  Time is used to eat, the act of filling the void a man that hasn't eaten all day has.  Perhaps the silence is a case of not pushing the matter further either.  ""If you're down there, at Smith Hall particularly, you should meet my son Lykane.""  Quick work is made of a small glass of plain water.  ""He's enjoyable.  Got it from his mother's side.""

Lisya tilts her head, ""He's a Smither, then? They're bein' good folk over there, when I had the chances to be makin' my way over.""

B'ane hasn't the sense of shame for eating as much as he does, riders do have that sense of entitlement after all.  ""Born with a wrench in his hand.""  The emotion finding B'ane's face touches each mouth corner and changes his face entirely for the better.  ""Likes to invent things.  Be careful he doesn't try to 'improve' your riding strap design.  You'll be at the Hold for a month.""  It seems, finally, the man's tank is full.  At least his plate's empty.

Lisya eats much, much slower, and still on her first plate. There's a bit of a laugh. ""While I wouldn't be mindin' a visit, I think Wyn'd be rather irrate with me. Either that or she'd be sendin' me all the scroll-work to be done. How's he with puttin' spikes on boots?"" she asks, far too cheerfully.

B'ane drags the napkin across his mouth in a final display of closure.  ""Lykane could put wher teats on boots,""  is said in staunch support of his offspring.  ""Though calling it fashion, now that's is up to you.""  A leg gets swung over the bench in what appears to be quiet exodus.  ""I spent too long eating as it is, however. Thank you, weyrwoman.""  And maybe he means it.

""Thank you for the company - an' lettin' me rant,"" Lisya replies, with a bright smile. Then, there's plotting to be done. Because.

B'ane soon disappears in a crowd.  It's a talent he's rather good at."

Great Hall (#1711J)
The immense hold doors lead to an equally immense Great Hall, with an entire wall of long windows and breezy white curtains that make a picturesque view that rolls down to the ocean. Most of the room is given over to several long rectangular tables, though a group of bright turquoise chairs and couches cluster invitingly next to the hearth and the endless pot of klah kept hot there. The Lord Holder's table has prime place near the windows, together but apart from the rest, while a wide flat bench occupies a little alcove in the far wall, heaped with brightly colored pillows to soak up the sun. Several broad archways, framed in the same golden wood as the floorboards, lead out to the rest of the hold.
You see Amrie here.
Sterling, Klohi, and D'yce are here.
Obvious exits:
Kitchen       Courtyard       Hallway       Hold Office

Fall indeed.  Rainfall.  The ground, already dark in mineral composition, is the color of a black hole when wet.  Aboleoth is visible clearly enough in the courtyard, bronze beast standing erect.  The Hold watchwher, a young beast and new at his post by the feels of it, has every bit of his hide as rainslicked as the dragon's.  They're sharing a communion of thoughts, testing the experiences of the other and ignoring for a moment their combined shortcomings.  B'ane would be within sharing water cooler talk with Lord Sterling.   

Lord Sterling strides forth as the great doors of the Hold slowly glide open.  At one heel stands a small smiling man known as Joseph, the Hold Steward.  The other well dressed heel is accompanied by a pair of impressive canines, calmly padding along with their master, always at the alert.  Still further back is a quad of statuesque armed guards that are so frigid they no longer seem human.  The authoritative assemblage slips from the grasp of afternoon sunlight as it gradually dwindles with the closing of the immense bronze doors that clamp shut with an impressive thunder which rolls throughout the great hall.    

Harquith takes the rainfall as a challenge. The dragon has it in her head that she's able to fly between the droplets, which not only leads one to wonder about her mindhealth, but make for a rather horrifying, erratic flight. Luckily, the green straightens out to land ever so gracefully in the courtyard, and allow her lifemate to slide down. Harquith squeals a greeting to Aboleoth, before hopping closer to try and use the much larger bronze for cover. Klohi takes a few unsteady steps towards shelter, still somewhat green around the gills from her bond's aerial acrobatics. Once she enters, the young woman finds her summoner, as well as the Lord Holder and his steward. ""Lord Holder."" She gives a soft smile, before offering a much larger grin to the bronzerider. ""Hope I'm not in trouble for coming in, rather than meeting up out in the courtyard?""

D'yce is only a brief moment behind Klohi and Harquith in his arrival; the brown trumpeting a hello to both Aboleoth and Harquith. Maybe with a touch more warmth for his clutchsib. When the Hold doors close behind them both and the other has offered her greeting he tips his head towards Sterling and salutes B'ane in a relaxed manner. ""Lord Holder, Wingleader B'ane."" he murmurs, his voice pitched enough to hear but not overly loud. He's trying not to pay a lot of attention to the grandeur of surroundings. 

B'ane perceives the influx of weyrlings through his link with Aboleoth though his focus on Sterling doesn't waver so much as a blink.  Well, only one.  ""You will address me as Wingleader,""  As Klohi makes her presence known, B'ane shoots down the greenling's nonchalance immediately.  Humiliating in front of the Lord Holder perhaps, but he's wagering the mistake won't happen again.  ""As I explained a moment ago these are the upstarts I was recently charged with.  Lord Sterling: riders D'yce, Klohi, Ai'den, J'namik and Al'tair,""  Each of the five named in accordance with order.  Outside Aboleoth extends his social network to include the young dragons.  And to enterprising Harquith, well, he's accommodating as a rain guard only from being curious to the green's preferences.     

Autumnal hues tone Sterling's elegant attire: you can almost hear the crackle of leaves in the crisp fabric of the copper overcoat as he strides forth, while the fine threaded shirt beneath captures the grays of the sky.  Black trousers are an ominous sign of the coming winter, but hope still remains with the polished gleam of freshly tilled loam colored wingtips.  The Lord inclines his head to each of the young riders as they arrive, but otherwise remains silent until the Wingleader speaks.  ""I see.""  Glacial frost eyes trace each in turn as a silent appraisal is made.  One of the canines breaks off to pad closer and give Klohi's boot an exploratory sniff.  

Perhaps it's the excitement of finally being placed within a real wing? More than likely, it's simply Klohi being her usual self, and so informality is the theme of the day. Or at least it was. She's already reaching down to coo and pet the 'puppy' as it inspects her boot, when B'ane reprimands her in front of the others, as well as Lord Sterling. Snapping up, body rigid, she lets out a quick, ""Yes, Wingleader."" Her arms remain stuck to her sides, and she will eventually recover. But for now, the greenrider gets to enjoy that squirming embarrassed feeling in her gut. As for Harquith's preferences, it's not being rained on- so she'll either use Aboleoth or the more familiar Chironath as living cover. It's good to be smaller.

Figures that they'd get stuck with a real hardass right out of the gates. D'yce flashes Klohi a sympathetic look after she is apparently schooled by their new boss. But he's pretty sure now wouldn't be the time to offer words of support. It seems safest to remain quiet and observant and thoughtful; default mode for the former starsmith. And that's exactly what he does, while trying not to look like the utter nerd that he is. It's Chironath that seems to have all the charm - if you could call it that. And he grunts at Harquith when she tries to use them as an umbrella. Nice. Now he feels -used-. 

B'ane hasn't been entertaining, or rather entertained by, Lord Sterling for very long as attested by the forgotten button towards the bottom of his flight jacket.  ""Now that they've arrived, I can bring up the purpose of this little congress.  As their leader I'm offering their assistance to the Hold in whatever fashions you and Steward Joseph can contrive and will permit be it counting livestock, clearing irrigation channels... Actually, I noticed the forest growth looks thick, especially on the leeward side of the island.  Clearing some of that would be another option.""  As in burn.  The man seems satisfied with Klohi's correction, B'ane's taciturn demeanor already less jagged.  To Sterling, ""I leave it at your convenience.""  Aboleoth is more approachable than his rider seems to be and as he has no arguments with rain, is a reliable bronze umbrella.

An approving half-nod responds to the speed with which Klohi comes around.  As B'ane speaks, Sterling's chin rises, lifting perception until he's staring down his long nose at the youthful riders.  Fingers steeple as silence is enforced, and in the interim Joseph does his own appraising with that ever present silent smile that glints sharply in gentle eyes.  A quick tweak of the thick mustache and the jolly man inches up behind his boss.  ""Lord Holder, what a blessing.  What a timely blessing!  What with the Conclave Gather coming.""  The reminder brings a spring gleam to artic eyes and Sterling nods in agreement, and then doffs a bow of gratitude to B'ane.  ""Thank you Wingleader, what a lovely gift.""  

Klohi wants to touch the puppy. Yes. Yes she does. But it seems one public scolding is enough for today. While she does ease into a more relaxed stance, her gloved hands remains at her sides. D'yce's silent sympathy earns him a gentle smile, but the gesture is shortlived as she turns her attention on both Wingleader B'ane and Lord Sterling. As the bronzerider speaks, Klohi's brows try their damnest not to lower, and her lip stays firmly in place. The Great Hall is no place for pouting. Keeping her expression as blank as possible, the greenrider stands still, trying to avoid anymore attention. For once. Harquith is the exact opposite, and while Aboleoth makes an excellent umbrella, the green is turning around and squishing her feet into the mud. << Hehehe. Oh, I'll clear up that growth real quick... >> Ominous, no?

D'yce keeps a pleasant smile on his face no matter what. That's right - even as thoughts of horribly demeaning chores float through his mind, memories of apprenticeship and candidacy... sigh. ""We're glad to help, sir."" To whichever sir is most appropriate. He doesn't /quite/ sound like he /really/ means it. But at least he knows the routine right? << Harquith... >> Chiro nath begins, warningly. Whenever she gets that one, there is sure to be trouble that follows. 

""Certainly,"" B'ane responds, concise.  There's no desire to keep everyone's daily rituals on pause any longer than necessary.  ""Thank you for your time, Lord Sterling.  Let me know of your suggestions at your convenience.  I will proceed to offer a few of my own as well.""  The Weyr-drilled man then addresses the quintet of new riders:  ""Thank you for attending my summons,"" Baritone even-keeled.  ""You are free to return to the Weyr and to your normal duties.""  Because that's exactly what he's going to do, fingers already fastening the tier of jacket buttons."

Ista's Beach (#1552J)
Rolling sand lines the surf, marred by footprints and dragonprints alike.  Lush tropical greenery hems the beach like a gem necklace, with the peaks of Ista weyr rising majestically in the background.  A sudden rise in the landscape leads to a plateau above - the only fallen section of those peaks - where the feeding pens reside.
  It is summer.
You see Klimth here.
I'es is here.
Obvious exits:
Plateau       South Beach       SAndy Beach       Pier       Ocean       Runner Trail

B'ane, a kinetic type, must always be moving.  Fortunately for him there is always some path to walk, sight to see.  He's taken to the beach on foot as has been assessing the Weyr's herdbeast stock for at least a few minutes.  He believes himself to know something of everything, having brought the lameness of a steer to a beastcrafter's attention.  Now B'ane's mission is to assess weyrlings and they aren't conveniently penned in one place.

It's no longer feeding time for Einarth. The bronze in question is overhead, wings outstretched and skimming the thermals until the widening shadow skims over the ebony sands until coming it and the dragon dives into the sparkling water. The result is water and waves for those in his general vicinity until he comes up with a triumphant bugle. It's enough to cause I'es to laugh, sitting squarely onto the sands with his jacket first to touch the ground before the rest of him followed. For now, he may not see the newest Wingleader striding onto the beach. But once he does? There's no mistaking the speed in which he does come to his feet, sand or no sand impediments.

Flight jacket intact despite the beautiful bounty of a day, B'ane at least has a light shirt underneath to circulate the sea breeze.  Without Aboleoth B'ane is less intimidating, but only by 1/2.  ""There may be a dolphin in your dragon's ancestral line.""  He's seen Einarth's glorified tumble into the ocean and is by I'es's side, eyes hidden by colored goggles.  He's a hard man to read to begin with and with his eyes covered that feat will increase in difficulty.

""I think he's part something, but dolphin? I'm not so sure about that,"" I'es replies, unconsciously straightening somewhat until both thumbs hook into the belt looks at his waist with his gaze settling out over the water. ""I hear congratulations are in order, Wingleader."" Word travels fast when you're a weyrling.

Notoriously short: that is how B'ane's brown hair is represented.  He can feel the breeze on his scalp and it's a pleasant feeling, though you wouldn't guess by looking at him.  ""I wouldn't say that just yet,""  B'ane opines truthfully.  ""What is your name, weyrling?""  This shouldn't feel like a detective's interrogation by the bronzerider's tone of voice though I'es may draw his own conclusions.

For all of it not being an interrogation, the bronze weyrling doesn't reflect any of his thoughts based on the current line of questions. Especially as the water play of his lifemate turns more meticulous. Getting clean is a growing importance for Einarth, who is gestured to with a dip of his chin without changing would could be a relaxed stance - if his shoulders were to stop being so stiff. ""That's Einarth. My name is I'es,"" he replies, a sideways glance accorded to the man before turning more of his attention onto B'ane. ""What do you think of the new wing, if it's alright to ask.""

""I'es,""  B'ane squirrels the name away,  ""I'm B'ane,  mourner of my lost anonymity.""  The offhand admission swept easily away by the ocean wind.  ""Do you know gardens, I'es?  I think that's what I can best describe it as.  You have these plants as individuals cultivated under someone elses hand though you can recognize their shapes and know their varieties.  And then you're made gardener, given the shears and told to go pruning.""  Indicative of B'ane, carried through his persona are colorful maxims.

Florals? One may has well have asked if I'es deals in fragrant perfume oils. The twitching that begins at one corner of the man's lips only serves to usher in more bemusement on the weyrling rider's features. ""I'm learning quite more about gardens these days, B'ane,"" he remarks, the reason behind such statements go unspoken for now. ""The analogy is well-understood, though."" With that statement made, the amusement fades in favor of mere talking while he considers what more to say. ""What changes are you looking to implement? While I know that I'm hardly the first weyrling to approach, it's more of a curiosity in what makes the wings different.""

B'ane's arms are folded centered abotu his chest, but loosely, the outside hand placed over the opposite arm and not wedged within in.  ""Was it?  I often get a good round of blank stairs and overenthusiastic responses that tip me off people aren't following what I meant.  I can speak straightforwardly of course but it's one way to test listeners. As for changes, well, I need more time to see what there is to change, you understand.""  He's been at Baysweeper's head for a minimum number of days.  Picking up on the young bronzerider's comment, ""But if I need aid with Bollian dahlias I now know whom to turn to.  Clear skies, I'es.""  The delivery is quick, possibly with comedic intent.  B'ane takes time getting over the beach dunes because he's looking at the deep foliage errantly skirting the shoreline.

""I have a few acquaintances who are very handy with florals,"" is the easier explanation that I'es can and does reply with, shifting his weight slightly from a balance of both feet onto one. Sand doesn't make for steady footing. Or it's the quip from the bronzerider which catches him off guard with a rueful retort and a smirk surfacing once more. With one hand lifting to offer a salute to the Wingleader, he continues blithely, ""I'd fear for the plant's safety, if that's the case."" Either he or Einarth might make short work of it. As the other man moves off along the beaches, he calls back, ""Clear skies to you too, sir."""

Fortress of Solitude (#12619D)
Veils of darkness descend on this Spartan chamber to give an impression of a vacant cloister.  Shadows conquer, leaving a paradigm of tranquility apt to counter and eliminate negative thoughts no matter how severe.  Beacons of glows are aligned in strategic locations mostly in niches around the circumference of the weyr's walls.  Neglect is prevalent: dust, dirt, and dirty dishes congesting the flow of the room.  The owner has few material goods and adds little to personalize the abode.
Obvious exits:
Ledge

Tia has arrived.

A short but loud bugle heralds the arrival of Kyraceth and her rider; unannounced of course, as they circle in for a landing on Aboleoth's ledge. The green tries to nudge him playfully with a wing, even, while Tia dismounts and gives him a polite nod. ""Morning. I'm guessing B'ane's in. May as well give him enough warning to pull on some pants if he's not dressed yet."" she notes, pasting on a cheerful smile, and waiting maybe a moment before she pretty much heads in to invade the man's sanctuary. ""Good day, B'ane. Nice place. Dirt, dishes, dustbunnies... you've been a bachelor a while, eh?"" Only Tia would start out a visit like this. Really. 

Sunning fully, Aboleoth's body is spread out like a thing dead:  wing, tail, head arched back.  Signs of life get demonstrated by the deep even breaths and lack of scavenging insects which would otherwise find in him a buffet.  Reflexes are good however, that lone sprawled wing collapsing into a fold to make room for Kyraceth.  He hums to her after lifting his head and shoulders, not musically, but in surprised and hospitable earnest.  Within, B'ane is fully dressed and working by a glowlight and chair upended.  It is in sore need of repair which he has been committing to.  He's on his feet and looking outside quickly for more visitors.  ""I no longer have access to what former belongings I did have,"" looking around at the scant interior.  ""They didn't make my weyr a show piece, but there was, it had more character.  What can I do for you, Weyrsecond?""  He is genuinely surprised.

Kyaceth is content to merely flop down beside Aboleoth in a companionable manner and soak up the sun.  ""You know you have access to stores, and can requisition furniture, wall hangings... anything you need."" It's less of a question and more of a reminder, since she knows she went through this with him when he first found himself stranded in this time. ""You like fixing things?"" she wonders then, head tilted slightly when she catches the state of disrepair on the chair. ""For me? Well, I tend to pay random visits now and then. It seems to help with cohesion.""  It's a confusing explanation, likely, but he'll catch on at some point. ""I did have a question for you actually. I need to know if you still have a problem taking orders from young.. ok, youngish.."" SIGH. getting old sucks, etc, etc.. ""greenriders."" Yes, blunt works best in her mind. 

""I had firelizards too, they tended to fill up the space.  Care to sit down on... a bureau?""  Thinking fast, the bronzerider pulls a small, two-drawer housing, bureau closer to Tia.  That at least has stability to it.  ""The chair is really more kindling than seat.""  A replicated slat has been whittled and lies with bright new wood next to the scoop-shaped chair.  ""I never did congratulate you on the birth of your son.  He's got to be, what, six, seven months old?""  B'ane allows the matter of furniture to fall without maintenance.  The actuality is he never thought of permanence because he wasn't sure he wouldn't try regrasping at his thin timeline in the future.  On the ledge Aboleoth is a social enough beast to treat Kyraceth to more prolonged hums and deeper reverberations that can barely be heard on a human audio scale.  ""This has to do with taking orders?""  B'ane's attitude is agreeable, or he's trying, less forbidding.  But he didn't answer the question.

""Oh, that'll be fine."" Tia sits down gingerly, though it's more what one would call polite then ladylike. ""Thank you. He's nearly a turn now. I can hardly believe how much time has passed."" Tia admits, glancing down at her hands for a moment before she listens for B'ane's answer. ""Oh, that's a part of it. Taking orders. But you haven't answered the question yet, so I really can't elaborate."" she explains, keeping her tone even, the barest of smiles appearing. ""Come now, B'ane. You've been here for turns. Ista's leadership can't be all that bad. We've done very well despite the fact that we've no gray hair."" Kyraceth is content enough to reply in her own way with rumbles and hums that are more reminiscent of machinery then anything else, though she's quite chatty compared to her usual quiet looming attempts. 

B'ane's eyes get thrown at Tia in the purest metaphorical sense.  ""He's a turn already?""  B'ane's recovery is spent with one hand hitched on his belt. ""I guess I've been avoiding you longer than I thought.""  Tia has him desiring what knowledge she's so righteously dangling and to get it he answers in truth.  ""I didn't say Ista's leaders were bad,""  or if he did he's since changed his mind.  ""Only, oh, pretentious. But you're right, I can see the Weyr's been functioning well all things considered."" All those presumptuous young riders, an early Pass, etc. ""I won't be that arrogant to claim otherwise."" Brown-black eyes narrow, engaged.  ""Now tell me what you want me to know.""  

""Pretentious? Pretentious? Are you for real?"" Tia all but squeaks, completely taken aback at this new complaint. ""I'd like you to explain that one to me."" She can understand young, overeager, inexperienced... but this one, apparently, she's decided to take umbrage with. ""I should have gone with my original plan.""  she mutters to herself. ""Well, you'll unfortunately be seeing a lot more of me in the future. And while I have no problem with wingriders who don't like me, our Wingleaders had better at least pretend to respect me. We have to present a united front."" Which he should well know, so she doesn't bother elaborating. Instead, she just pulls a shoulder knot out of her pocket and gestures towards his hand. ""congratulations, B'ane. You get to spend a whole lot more time wanting to avoid me, but not being able to. We'd like you to take up a Winglead position.""

B'ane itches the lobe of an ear where some hair shouldn't be touching.  Certainly it's time to get that cut again.  ""Pretensiousness is a common dragonrider trait, especially if they ride bronze or have tassels in their knot.  Look, I don't mean to insult you personally - grandiose has its ben-"" B'ane stops mid-sentence, an absolutely dead spot.  ""You mean the people I've just called out feel appropriate to laud my merits,""  now there's a horse of a different color.  And no, no apologies come to tongue.  ""I see.""  The man looks down to the floor then reissues his eyes to Tia.  ""Why make a leader out of a man who isn't so tractable...  why promote outside the Weyrleader's circle of trust?  S'tao has riders who openly praise him.""  Outside Aboleoth has all four feet under him again, tensing against the resolution his bond is experiencing.  No doubt there are whole comments flying through their link.

Kyraceth perks up when Aboleoth starts getting all tense, headknobs twitching with what must be amusement from her. << Relax. She doesn't bite. >> Pause. << Unless asked nicely. >> Tia shoots a dirty look back at the weyr entrance, before turning a closed expression back to B'ane. This must be her poker face or something because there's no trace of anything but bland banality there. ""You know nothing about me, B'ane. Nothing. So you can make all the assumptions you like about my 'style' of leadership, but..."" Ah, then it hits home for him what they're asking him to do and her chin tilts ever more stubbornly. ""There are plenty of people with winglead positions, among others, that are not within his 'circle of trust'. We want people who know what they're doing. All of us are pretty good at seeing past ass-kissing, thank you. To the question of why you? Well, we have a somewhat... intractable group of weyrlings soon to graduate. Overconfident, clumsy, rash, brash, hyper... and while weyrlinghood has tempered it a bit, we'll need to keep a tight reign on some of them for awhile. You can do that. We'll take some in our wing, you'll get some in yours. See?"" 

The aquiline bronze subdues, flanks lowering though his eye facets reel in shades of blueish-cadmium.  He responds to Kyraceth in a paced out, informative timbre,  << He committed himself to never lead again after falling as Weyrleader. Many Turns ago. >>  ""Ah, so you need a nanny.  Now that sounds more honest.""  The veteran bronzerider gathers his arms against his chest as he crosses and eventually recrosses his legs while standing in one spot.  ""Agreed.  I will lead one of the wings.  Then any assumptions I make may be fact based so you won't glare as hard.  Shells.  Can you stop Thread with that?""  After chewing the very tip of his tongue he asks the name of his commission, ""which?""

Kyraceth takes a moment to consider this new information; her tail swishing sharply before it curls back around herself. << This will be good for him, then. >> she decides, with all the authority of one who has no idea what she's talking about but sure does know how to bluff! ""What, did you think I was going to lie? I wouldn't do that with lives at stake."" she assures, that glare that turned bland finally transforming into a winning smile when he agrees. ""And here I bet S'tao that you'd need to hear it from him before you'd think about accepting."" She's actually pleased about losing this one. ""I have it on good authority that my glares can turn a man to stone."" she whispers dramatically, next, just prior to unfolding her clenched hand in front of him. The one that holds his new knot of course. ""You'll be leading Baysweeper.""

B'ane takes the necessary steps to secure the knot Tia presents but places it on a table designed for eating.  Perhaps he's already having second thoughts.  B'ane and Aboleoth now mirror each other in composition, remaining largely still as they process thoughts both solitary and joint in nature.  ""So long as I made someone rich,""  he muses in a lighter mood.  ""Anything else, Weyrsecond?""  That chair is begging to be either fixed or put out of its misery.

Tia is unrepentant about her bet making. It's one of her few vices and she's keeping it, dammit! ""I've a bit of time before I need to sort through the days sweeps reports, if you want help with... that."" she offers, looking skeptically at the 'chair'. she refuses to call it one. ""Or I can just have someone come up to get it for scraps and get you a real chair, if you want. Otherwise no, I won't bother you with anything else."" At the moment she's being good natured about his discomfort with her at least. Just watch out when Kyraceth starts glowing. 

B'ane's focused eyes dart towards the chair, glance soon blinked over to the woman while the rest of his face stays motionless.  He then proceeds over to the dilapidated chair and tosses as he moves,  ""you any good with a drill?""  Aboleoth's eyes and countenance have lost their anxious edge and if Kyraceth tolerates the abrupt arched spread of his wings, indicative of a good hearty stretch, he'll be content to resume attendance by her side.  In an all-knowing, breeze-like observation.  << This may eventually turn out alright. >>  The chair and their futures indeed have potential."

Weyrlingmaster's Office (#1213DoJ)
Dimly lit by glows, this small, office like room, is a hollowed cavern to the east of the barracks with a leather curtain covering the short tunnel's exit to offer a modicum of privacy. Small stone nooks are pigeon-holed for the storage of scrolls of wherhide, likely holding centuries worth of 'training' discertations. Nearby is a small desk made of precious wood and worn by age and time, though gleaming with a luster of many oiled cleanings. The desk is littered with many odds and ends of equipment -- hides, leathers, straps, and even a few items that might be used to repair those bits. A lone klah mug rests in the one clear place on the desk. A large wooden chair with lots of freshly sewn and stuffed cushions lining it is placed behind the desk. Several more chairs, uncomfortable, hard-seated bits of furniture are in front of the desk or scattered around the room. Opposite the tunnel covered by leather is an ancient, small stairway leading its decaying way upwards through the stone to a connecting weyr. 
This office is the Weyrlingmaster's work-place.
I'deni is here.
Obvious exits:
Barracks

Creaky chair creaks. Loudly. Like usual. I'deni is in the midst of pushing up to his feet from the elderly, but well-padded chair, giving the thing a bit of a nudge to give him some room. He starts about the edge of the desk, only to smirk, hesitate, and come back around to go riffling in one of the drawers.

Having passed a few weyrlings installed by their couches and exercising their life-mates out in the open air of the bowl.  B'ane shared humble greetings with any he met but his mind is largely elsewhere.  The knock at I'deni's door is surprisingly modest for a man his size.  ""Evening, Weyrlingmaster.  Is this eh, a good time?""  The door isn't quite allowed to fully shut.  B'ane likes fresh air and a clean escape.

I'deni pulls his hand from the drawer, hand balled into something of a fist as the man straightens. His head turns before his body, looking to B'ane as the man approaches and enters. ""Good a time as any,"" the man speaks. Looking to face the older rider, slightly lifted eyebrows in question show upon a skeptical facade.

""I handed my report in to K'daun when you were in the infirmary yesterday, I trust he gave it to you.""  The man's soft-spoken baritone doesn't vary much in pitch.  B'ane doesn't sit but there is one hand on the back of a chair to show some sort of connection to the room.  ""I spoke only briefly with Dragonhealer S'ttaro.  How are the weyrlings?""  And looking earnest the bronzerider wants an earnest response.

Silence ensues. I'deni simply looks across to B'ane with really not much of a flicker of recognition or even interest as to the man's words. After a breath or two though, the man finally nods, and then comes the show of slight bemusement. ""I glanced at it. They're... weyrlings. Flying. I imagine D'yce has them cluttering up the skies right now.""

""So no permanent injuries, no ruptured pectoral plates or ripped ligaments?  I was counting on a few sprains actually.  Scores? None of those either?  Faranth.""  Eyebrows leap high in sync, give pause, and lower after a few seconds of endurance.  ""I'll tell you I would have loved to see my face that day when Aboleoth starting to roar like his tail was aflame.""  

I'deni lifts his free hand up, rubbing fingers across his brow before fingers spread and comb back his pale hair from vivid eyes. ""No. Sprains? Sure. Gallifreth and a couple of the others. Scrapes and bumps and all of the other assorted shit."" The man shrugs it off though, ""If there was thread, I'm sure you'd have heard the keening of your dragon. Wings took care of it."" B'ane's last comment actually brings about something of a chuckle, and a momentarily duck of his head. ""Better his ass than any of their's."" 

B'ane comes back strongly.  ""I'll take it.""  The trailing hand on the chair returns to him and it rests in traditional comfort on an old belt pouch.  ""For all its unpredictability it's what saved us in the end.""  The assorted objects tangled on the Weyrlingmaster's desk are observed abstractly before dark eyes arrest Ideni's a final time.  ""Carry on then, Weyrlingmaster.""  A singular nod and B'ane's gathering the door knob in his hand.

I'deni is a firm believer in experience over lecture, and it shows in the wry shrug that follows the other man's words. He nods his head after him, and adds, ""Maybe you can take them out betweening to Igen and catch them in a sandstorm. We can only hope. Clear skies, B'ane.""

For only his benefit alone B'ane grins ruefully as his boots hammer out of the barracks and relive in echo."

B'ane reaches, pulls a branch to eye level where he can count the serrated notches on a particular lead.  Nope, no fruit tree here.  The light getting through the canopy is heavily filtered and seeming to move on the whims of a branch-shifting breeze.  A scatter of firelizards throw their shadow shapes on the forest floor amid agitated shrieks.  It's second only to Aboleoth's gullet-born roar.  It takes but a split second for the bronze to carry dire sentiments to his rider.  ""THREAD!""  B'ane's dark eyes are already taking a panicked head count as he runs.  Aboleoth doesn't let up: his bugles are forceful shrieks that would wake the dead and interred.

Gallifreth's attention can be in multiple places at once. He's just amazing like that. While he's busy admiring the flowers, he overhears Dakhanavarath's comment. << Leave him alone Dakhanavarath. He doesn't need your teasing. >> There's a teasing note in his tone, but the mechanical whirring gets perceptibly louder; a warning. At the same time, a bunch of firelizards catch his attention. These are hunting some of the jungle's invertebrate life. He watches with rapt attention, crooning as a young brown catches something. All the while, his tail is a-twitching and he vibrates with a sense of 'not right'. Perhaps that 'not right' is Kaijuth, with a huge draconic sigh, he pulls himself away from the flowers. << Kaijuth...the tree didn't move. Now come back and...! >> He cuts off his own thought with a loud, forceful bugle. He /roars/ and runs to K'thin, eyes whirring bright red. << We need to get out of here /now/. >> 

Sulk, sulk, sulk; Veveshoth is a broken record at this point. Things just aren't going his way, and Al'tair is not help attempting to console the bratty blue. ""Come on, relax."" Nothing works, then... Al'tair notices his sleeve, ""Hey, Vev, I didn't catch the edge of my shirt on that tree we brushed up against, did I?"" The blue shakes his head no, ""I didn't think so."" But his thinking is interrupted by the firelizards and mass shouting, which perks the two of them straight up and to attention. Al'tair concerned about the whole Thread thing, and Veveshoth for a chance to prove himself in a moment of valor and glory. << Thread? Where? I do not see the thread. >> His agitation at not being able to find the silvery ribbons of doom is practically palpable. 

""Hey, who's throwing chunks of tunnelsnake?"" demands E'siac after one messily ricochets off his shoulder. Those who are known to him aren't suspected and instead receive bright smiles. In Kaijuth's defense, Shaarth does sort of sound like an old tree, creaking and groaning like one of the large trunks surrounding him. << It would be a great error to mistake me for a killer tree, and a greater error to taste a killer tree if you ever came across one. >> Groan. Weyrlings. And yet the brown seems keen on exploring with the youngin's with his rider perched ontop, carelessly slumped between sepia neckridges. Minalth earns a look from Shaarth along with a metaphysical toss of sand in his brother's direction. << You worrith me. >> Dragon humour! Snap. Shaarth follows Aboleoth's lead, signaling the onslaught of Thread while his rider makes quick work buttoning his riding gear and tying himself into his riding straps. ""Where's that damn hat of mine... And what do we do with these weyrlings? Can't just leave them out here, can we?"" Shaarth coils for take-off but doesn't yet spring into action.

<< He /said/ 'have fun', >> Dakhanavarath says to Chironath, mentally pouting at the other brown's attempt to ruin it. But then Kaijuth actually goes with it, and the hunchbacked dragon is madly gleeful by this turn of events, moving away from his puddle to watch even closer. << Oh that, one, definitely that one,>> And yet Dak, moving, starts getting distracted by his surroundings, searching for something interesting and fuzzy to poke and prod at. Syvia shakess her head at the dragons, sighing heavily before turning her attention onto D'yce. What can she do about it? Nothing, so long as no one is trying to kill each other. ""Just common herbs, seeds to grow later. Useful for teas, too. And dragonstongue is easy to grow, would love to have just a section of that, always useful. And that would be great, Lisya, at least until I can get my own ledge."" She crouches at some low lying plants, completely entranced by the plants. But not too entranced to miss the bronze's roar, falling to sit heavily on the ground in surprise as she stares up wildly at the call. ""Thread?!"" 

For the sake of his clutch brothers, steady steps deviate from where he was headed and turn rather towards Kaijuth and Dakhanavarath begin their preliminary assault of the tree - or trees. Meanwhile, I'es is more than comfortable playing spectator to the splinter removal attempts. With both hands settling against secure belt loops, the weyrling rider took an involuntarily step back once the jaws snapped shut. ""I'd like to know what the appeal is,"" he remarks to both men a beat before Aboleoth's roar that is soon to be echoed by Einarth. The singular word galvanizing the bronze, whose wings spread out with rapidly whirling eyes taking on a reddish tinge as he broadcasts too loudly. << Thread! I'es. We must fight. Where is it? >> Only, the man is looking skywards for signs of the silvery mass. ""Einarth! Don't get any ideas! We can't do anything yet!"" << Why!? >> Was that a trumpet? Yes, yes it was.

""Shit and shambles, pair up! Pair up!"" B'ane's shoving a young boy closer too his green in his quest to account for each weyrling and their dragon.  Aboleoth's alarms have lessened, or maybe they're just part of a growing chorus.  << Find yourselves and form rank! >>  B'ane's trying to find Q'luin but the other bronzerider is lost in the bedlam.  He happens quickly upon E'siac.  ""We're sitting whers out here and there's no time to get back to the Weyr."" B'ane's baritone varies in stressed syllables.  

It only takes a second for the warning and message to sound out across weyr and dragon minds. Wingleaders reach out for their wingmates, gathering up in the center of the bowl for instructions. It is there that Sephiroth and S'tao assembles the might of Ista to gear up quickly to defend their territory and their lives. ""Sharding Thread can't follow a sharding chart!"" Is it fault of crafter, confused Weyrleader, or just Nature being ornery, who knows, but Thread is indeed falling over the southern end of the the Island, right over the Weyr itself, which it so rarely does. Precious minutes are spent as riders struggle into their gear and mount up, dragons crunching on stone while trying to take off and get into formation. ""Are the senior weyrlings ready with 'stone?"" An acknowledgement from their wings' leaders and that is all the time they have for prep before the Wings take to the sky.

Mention of the ancient menace is enough to set Chiro's eyes whorling a dangerously scarlet red and he practically lands /on/ D'yce in his haste to reach his rider and poke at him none too lightly with his muzzle to urge him aboard for whatever they're going to do. First he reaches for the former healer's hand to help her up so she can run to Dak. ""Any caves nearby?"" he ventures aloud, as he hurriedly scrambles up brown hide to try and buckly himself onto his own lifemate. 

<< Thread! >> Minalth's melodious tunings forgotten, as he takes up and joins Aboleoth's battle cry, in hot, bursting trumpets. Instinct kicks in and he is shoving through the undergrowth to reach Shaarth's side. Whats a threadfight without your brother-in-arms? Zerra is madly pulling on her leather jacket, tugging her hair back into a rough knot on her head, eyes quick to take in the scene. ""We have to keep Lisy safe..."" the redhead leans right out over her dragons shoulder towards Shaarth so she can whisper-call that urgently to E'siac. So apparently, the rest of you can go jump, coz only Lisy is important? Perhaps its more to do with her not having firestoney protection ""Why aren't ya'll on your dragons already?"" she turns to shout out and wave a hand ""Mount up, guys, c'mon!"" Clearly patience is not her virtue. ""We need firestone!"" Minalth is a smooth, calming tone beneath the hubub << Aboleoth, Shaarth, we can take point. We can keep them together. >> 

Lisya nods at Syvia, ""That is what I was thinkin'... an' really, a pot wouldn't take much roo...."" the last word is swallowed whole by roaring dragons and shouting riders, as the weyrling looks towards the sky. There's a brief moment, where she just freezes, before Meliaith breaks her out of it by charging for her rider. The short weyrling grabs for the straps as soon as they are in reach, and swarms up to her back, straping herself in with shaking hands. ""... no more gathers or volunteerin'...Never again."" Never mind she didn't volunteer this time.

Gallifreth's mind voice is sharp, pointed, commanding, but it's calm at the same time. This is a blue who's not panicking. << Einarth, Veveshoth you dimglows! We can't fight it, we can't flame, there's not ready supply of firestone, and we don't know how to go Between yet. Or would you rather get lost in that void? >> That last sentence drips with sarcasm, a high pitched whining noise forefront in his thoughts. Explosions color his thoughts and he ROARS again as K'thin vaults onto his neck. The blue then rushes toward Syvia and extends his wings over the young woman until Dak can reach her. He'll protect them all, if he has to. K'thin echos D'yce's thoughts. ""Are there any caves, any rock over hangs, anything at all that we can shelter underneath."" Taking cue from his dragon, the young man is remarkably calm, all things considering.

Great, Rank. That puts Veveshoth with... Gallifreth. Veveshoth reluctantly pairs up with his brother blue and zaps him a mental rumble of displeasure. The blue cannot be consoled and is very anxious in his spot. << You do not need to worry, Galli/freth/ as I will handle the thread for you. In the meantime, you ought to get into rank. You're out of line. >> Stealing his glory, is more like it. Al'tair will have none of this and yells at his blue, ""You need to work with your siblings, this is the real deal, Vev. I don't care that you need to feel vindicated for all the times that Gallifreth has beaten you at a footrace, we've got to tackle this as a team."" 

""You can't flame. We haven't been taught yet. Soon, Einarth. Soon."" Speaking as well as mentally reinforcing such thoughts with as much certainty as possible as the bronze turns towards him with louder, bigger steps even as I'es is all but running to the footholds. Quickly pulling himself back into the straps, he lifts one hand to signal towards Ai'den. ""Someone has to keep an eye on you!"" Kaijuth, really. Who knows what that'll dragon do? Speaking of. << We are meant to fight Thread, Gallifreth. I'es tells me the same, that we cannot. We /should/ be able to. >> And is he happy about it? No, the facts don't make him pleased while the young man looks towards K'thin with a brief, curt nod before looking to B'ane and calling out, ""What are we to do then?""

E'siac offers up: ""What if we-"" glancing at the larger dragons, ""- take turns hopping to the Weyr to load up with firestone and grab flamethrowers for the weyrlings? We can at least keep this area protected if we can't join the wings? And they'll get some experience in the field?"" Shaarth is still coiled, his whirling eyes detailing his aggitation and the urgent desire to join his comrades up above. << We all must contribute. We shouldn't hide while others fight. And it isn't safe for us to be unarmed, regardless of where we are hiding. >>
Everything, absolutely everything else is forgotten in that call announcing their nemesis.  

Kaijuth's head snaps up, slob clinging down his muzzle and neck in a sticky, frothy goo that really just isn't pretty.  His eyes continue to whirl violent red as he stares up at what can be seen of the sky from here.  The fact that Ai'den's stomach just bottomed out has Kaijuth feeling the same fear and worry, which just makes the dragonet mad.  He roars up at the sky, spinning around and jogging awkwardly towards his rider.  << We fly!  Kill tre..thread! >>  The tree would have to wait.  Fortunately, the shadowy bronze's training kicks in, superceding instinct, which means Ai'den has no trouble in getting his mount to fall into formation.  Ai'den works on buckling in, looking towards the senior riders because.. at this point, he doesn't know what to do.  His only thought is to get Kaijuth up into the air and back to the Weyr as fast as possible.  Meanwhile, the dragonet feeds off of his rider's energy, and that of his fellow dragons.  Especially the seniors debating on what to do with ..well..them.  << Kaijuth CRUSH! Thread go squish! >> Or at least, that's the general set of images the dragon sends to those around him. 

This threat has the former Weyrleader in B'ane on one of the worst grips of terror.  Thread is one thing, but being flameless as it falls is a death sentence.  ""Good idea. E'siac, Zerra, you each lead four, I'll take the last trio. There's a cave-- sort of, but there isn't time for us four,"" counting Q'luin, ""to make circuits to the Weyr."" Rubbing his forehead as if his hair were long enough to push back (it isn't)  B'ane takes on Syvia's question.  ""We're hoping.  There's a place.  Mount up and follow us!  Move!""  Tearing a strap in the force of his ascension on Aboleoth, the older rider leads the way to one of the first places he mapped in the cartography unit: a sink hole.

Gallifreth has had /enough/ of Veveshoth. Enough of the blue's constant insults, enough of the competition over nothing, enough of the arrogant, petulant, sulky blue. He rounds on his brother, his voice deadly quiet. << It is /you/ who is out of line brother. Our job is to protect, protect our friends, our team members, all of Pern. Ranks be damned when there are people to protect. Would you rather that Thread hit her and watch your brother brown writhe in agony while you, >> his voice drips with sarcasm and mocking, << 'get into line!' /I/ am going to do my job, and I suggest that /you/ shut up and do yours. >> Wow...the blue feels much better now. Back to business. << Kaijuth!! We can't fight it, not yet. Right now, >> he becomes deadly serious again, << we dodge, protect our lifemates, and get them to safety. Follow Aboleoth! >> The blue mentally and physically nudges those ahead of him in line and runs after the bronze. K'thin buckles all those extra straps as the blue takes off running, silent for now. Talking wastes energy.

All this talk of Thread and whatnot and Dakhanavarath cannot properly go tearing up funny looking things he had just found in the forest ground. With Syvia on the ground, the brown finally looks away towards her and the blue hovering above. Alright, now it's definitely time to go do what he's supposed to do. ""Dak! Dak get back here!"" He doesn't quite rush over, eyes focused through the canopy above in hopes of spotting their nemesis. << It really does have horrible timing. Can't explore, can't flame, there goes the entertainment. >> Syv scrambles to her feet, casting Gallifreth a grateful look before tugging on her brown's wing claw he started dragging open, to keep his attention focused and on the ground. ""You can't go /looking/ for it either, you sharding stupid dragon. Do you want Thread to hurt you or me?"" The brown doesn't answer, which would be worrisome any other time if Syv wasn't distracted. She mounts up quickly, trying to follow orders in the chaos now.

D'yce and Chironath quite readily fall into line to follow Aboleoth though the forest to whatever hidey hole is available. << Our lifemates safety comes first. We will have our time to fight soon enough. >> He aims the thoughts at the most agitated of the group, mindvoice laced with as eager an urgency to meet the menace as the others. For once, he even pays no attention to tunnelsnakes, tree branches, or icky stinkbugs when they go trampling towards their destination. 

Minalth gets down to business, snapping and clacking his jaw as he waits, unpatiently, for the weyrlings to fall into line ""C'mon, you heard him, into lines behind us! Move it!"" Zerra is similarly snapping, soldier's voice booming out over the melee. But its a private word that Minalth sends only to Aboleoth and Shaarth << We need firestone. They should flame. Not hide.>> But still, his rider is waving at various weyrlings that don't seem to be moving quick enough. ""Keep your dragons in check. Be in charge!"" Order, snap, wave, instruct. 
The familiarity of routine that comes with strapping in clears the brain, and Lisya leans forward. ""Keep your wings in, Meliaith, an' stay close with the others. We just have to be gettin' to the cave."" Meliaith starts forward, falling in after one of the riders. << No fighting! Fall in after Aboleoth, Shaarth an' Minalth! >> She doesn't quite snap after her siblings, but there is a sizzle to her words as she minds her wings and follows her own advice.

Veveshoth is shocked, nearly literally. He freezes in place for a moment, completely blown back by the voraciousness in Gallifreth's tone. Never before had he been emotionally challenged by his brother. What a traumatic experience. Veveshoth lets out a bit of a whimper, then falls back into line to follow B'ane out of the area. Al'tair smiles smugly and knowingly, ""I told you that you had it coming. Now, let's follow them out of here. Now's no time to be a hero."" He quickly mounts his blue and spurs Vev into position. << But Galli... he's being a hero... >> Al'tair quickly silences his blue, ""No, not now, we'll deal with this later. Now, safety is more important.""

Einarth falls into formation after the larger dragons, even as his eyes lift from time to time to scan the skies for any and all signs of their ancient foe. << Brothers! We should not fight amongst ourselves! We should save that for the Threads! >> Even as he moves in behind Meliaith, I'es is quickly making sure that all straps are secure with a glance over one shoulder for the others to see where they are in relation to them.  

It is to the testament of Ista Weyr that by the time Thread drops close enough to threaten the ground cover, the Wings are there to flame it out of the sky. Windjammer in the fore, followed alongside by Baysweeper and Sunwatcher. Cloudspinner, Reefskimmers, Tidechasers, and all the rest spread out behind the main wings, beneath them all comes the glittering forms of the queens in the Blackdiamond wing. Through the canopy above the forest, flickers of flame and all the colors of the dragons are just visible as well as the distant sounds of roaring, thundering wings, and rushing flame.

Boy there's just shouting going on all around them.  Both Ai'den and Kaijuth are getting quite a few mixed signals.  Flamethrowers?  Run?  Caves?  Hide?  Between?  Fly?  Kaijuth's head spins with it, and all the while he's being told in no uncertain terms that he couldn't do what he wants to do.  So, the bronze sulks, shifting restlessly in place, remaining silent.  He looks up to the sky where he knows those gray things are going to come and do Hurt.  Atop Kaijuth, Ai'den's nerves have started to cool.  The chaos around and within brings out enough of the guard in him that his heart stops racing and his gut stops twisting painfully.  Panic fades and he gently pats his dragon's side.  ""Lets do this, Kai.""  He says quietly before Kaijuth starts following quickly in formation.  Ai'den looks up at the main event above, releasing a breath to try and shake of the shivers.  Kaijuth trudges on.

The sink hole is easy to spot: no trees surround its rim.  This nakedness is a sore on the jungle thicket and the stench of old fire is no longer strong, but present like an old ghost.  Aboleoth heels his progress only until the twelve weyrlings are in view.  ""You and your dragons fly down that hole.  One-- no, two at a time.  Remember your training!""  Azerra and E'siac are sought.  ""I don't see any other options.""  Brown eyes are constant on the sky where he expects a clump of Thread to be at any moment.  East, the leading edge of the Fall is squarely overly the Weyr.

Sink Hole
     Barren ground studded by early grass thatch and crude rocks rings a great gap.  Light, maybe time, is swallowed by a deep cavern, straight through the ground to unknown depths.  Tartarus yawns, once fringed by sheets of vine mats and pioneer trees but since seared to not sustain Thread and herd grazers.  Black char marks demonstrate discouraging abuse and leach an acrid smell, a hellish basin of broken black stone that well earns the designation of under-world.
     Within, rays of light swim in the first five meters which quickly descends to part pitch.  The only total darkness comes at night to a rocky bottom fifteen or more meters deep and triple that in width.  This air chamber of a volcanic vault is a shrine of pyroxene and rough red scoria.  There are cavities within, dark spots, free of all light and habitat for any number of animalia.
Obvious exits:
Fly

As the group makes their way to sufficient cover, E'siac and Shaarth both grow increasingly aggitated but they make their way without openly expressing anything other than compliance. << One, two, three... >> Head count. ""Everyone made it without accident?"" Those who know him may note the slight edge in E'siac's voice.

>> (Aboleoth and Minalth) Shaarth is a blinding storm, whipping and whistling through the channels born available to him. << We need firestone. We need to have defense. We aren't sitting this Fall out here, are we? >> <<

Gallifreth is done berating Veveshoth, he doesn't even take time to correct the blue as his name is shortened /again/. The blue bugles and trumpets, agreeing with Einarth. The time for words has passed, now is the time for action! Gallifreth is in his element as he rushes towards the sink hole. He stops and moves to the side, letting a green pair and another blue pair go before him. << Hurry everyone! There is shelter here. >> He turns and looks, making sure no one is missing before launching himself into the sinkhole. Gallifreth is an ungainly blue, his previous attempts at flight have not gone terribly well, and that was /without/ the extra weight of K'thin on his back. As the blue launches himself over the edge, he drops before catching himself with a strong, labored wing beat. That one flap is enough to ensure that his glide doesn't end in a sickening crash. Still, the blue lands hard, and keeps his wings outstretched for balance, and to protect those dismounting around him. K'thin drops down and rushes to look his dragon over. << I'm fine. Go check on the others! Get them to the edge, in the caves. >> The blue commands his rider and any dragons that might be around as he slowly moves closer to the protection of the rock walls.

>> (Aboleoth and Shaarth) Minalth tempers his brother's desert storm with the wet whitewater crash of a sea squall << I agree, man. We need to fly. We must fight. They must learn. We can guide them >> the sea calms down as he has an idea << Sephiroth leads out bretheren above the forest. I could fly up, take firestone from them to bring back here. >> <<

Metal and heat. Paquith's mind, both a familiar and a far-away, presence spans far with a query << ? >> It is a question of where, of seeking and trying to find where the weyrlings have gone in hues of glossy red and sable.

Minalth is a subconscious mimic of his brother Shaarth, brown head bobbing in tempo with the other. ""Just keep calm, everyone, hear that?"" Zerra stands atop her dragons shoulders, pointing upwards ""You can hear the Weyr frying Thread right now. We'll be safe. Ista doesn't let Thread through"" Ahh give her some pom-poms for the team! Except since she hasn't got the booty, soldier girl looks towards B'ane and E'siac, strain across her face. She's itchin' to flame too.

>> (Minalth, Aboleoth, and Paquith) Shaarth is unmoved by Minalth's wet counteraction, a solid dune fixed beneath that crashing wave. << We can't exhaust the firestone already in use. The best solution is to go /between/ to load up firestone and flamethrowers, providing ourselves with protection without interupting the wings. We can join the ground crews. Surely the weyrlings would be useful at that? Hiding is not an option for me. >> Meanwhile a tendril reaches out to Paquith with images of the sink hole and its location along with the faces of each weyrling unharmed. << Safe. But unarmed. >> <<

Chironath is far too comfortable dropping down into utter darkness as he glides down swiftly and comes to an abrupt and jarring landing on a stone outcropping. << We have landed. Safe. >> he reports back to Paquith promptly, listening for the others who haven't said they're there already. ""Is everyone alright?"" His tone harbors a tinge of anxiety in it that he clamps down on to slide off his lifemate and start checking his talons and knee joints for damage after that landing. 

With the weyrlings safe, E'siac kicks Shaarth into gear. ""We're being pulled out. The wing needs us, wingleader's orders."" Is that a taunting grin tossed at Zerra for being pulled out of the sink hole by duty? Maybe. Then they're off, slow and steady like a 747 lifting off. They'll get there eventually.

Meliaiath barely pauses at the edge of the sinkhole, snapping her wings out to glide downward, Lisya just enough weight to cause the dragon to veer slightly, so that she gets a touch too close to the rock, but the landing is mostly adequate. Lisya unbuckles and slithers around, ""Are you alright, Mel?"" The answer seems to be positive, as the two join the others under cover, where the rider starts to inspect Mel's wings. << We have flown together! Into a hole >> her thoughts join with Chironath to follow to Paquith.

Finally, something in the element of Veveshoth, flying. His oversized wings grant this blue very few things, but one of them is flight. He naturally takes to the edge and leaps right off without so much as a second thought, Al'tair practically having a panic attack atop the blue's back. To make things worse, Veveshoth tucks his wings in, pulls into a sharp dive and spirals down until he is assuredly going to crash. Suddenly, his wings are opened and the pair pull up to skim the ground gracefully. Carefully, Veveshoth slows down until he parks up beside Gallifreth and lands softly. His eye whirl a greenish-blueish as he states to Gallifreth that, << Mine was screaming, how did your's do? >> Al'tair is pale white atop his dragon, a husk of a man with hair stuck back from the speed of the descent. Without so much as moving his upper torso, the rider slides down into a dismount and heads over to the cave. Veveshoth calmly asks, << Anything else, Gallifreth, or shall we head to safety ourselves? >> 
OOC: E'siac says ""Sorry for leaving early but it was definitely fun! Don't get yourselves killed.""

The sensation of a rumble is felt far too easily as I'es remains astride Einarth, whose head is lifted high with quickening color within his eyes as he tries to see anything above of import. His own landing, sends the pair solidly onto the 'floor' with the dragon's wings quickly folding against himself. More to back away from those others who land nearby. Meanwhile, the man is the one who keeps a hand firmly against the bronze's hide as he looks towards Zerra and then E'siac. 

And Minalth bugles after Shaarth as he departs. Apparently they've been ordered to stay put to keep mind with Aboleoth while the others do all the exciting battle-stuff. Zerra swings down from her dragon's shoulders, to head straight into the lines of weyrling dragons. She pauses by Einarth, looking up at the bronze with a narrowed gaze, checking for health ""You guys ok?"" she mentions to I'es, then moving on before he can truly answer ""Lisy, Meliaith did well.."" here the redhead tryly pauses, watching as the younger woman checks her dragons wings. 

Kaijuth likes to stomp about on the ground, but he's actually not too terrible in flight.  Despite.. being a bit shakey, he manages to at least control his decent.  Its Ai'den, clinging to the dragonet's pointy neckridge like a lifeline, that seems the most worried.  The weyrling's eyes are closed, though such doesn't help because Kaijuth feeds him a second-by-second image-flicker of their decent into the deeeeeep, dark sinkhole.  Ai'den's ride is much like riding in a plane during a hurricane.  Not fun. And when the dragon touches down, Ai'den doesn't even have time to slide off his beast before he scrambles to vomit over the side. Sadly, it gets on Kaijuth as much as the floor, and he looks like he's going to be ill again.  Even Kaijuth seems disturbed by this event and croons softly.  << Mine okay? >>  He states, looking around to him and gently nuzzling his side.  Ai'den just groans, works at unbuckling, and slides to the ground.  

A hole for the weyrlings? Dakhanavarath actually dares to hiss out loud, which likely isn't a good sign at all, before he takes the plunge along with his rider. It would have been nice, flying astride her lifemate for the first time, if Syvia wasn't still worried about the Thread overhead and Dak had a nice straight glide instead of the rocking that threatens to throw her off at any moment. The brown flexes his wings to their full span, catching what little air there was before he makes a stumbling landing that jars Syvia even more. The brown grips the stone tightly with his talons, folding wings quickly as well. Syv holds on tightly as she looks around to the others. ""It can't get to us here, right?"" she asks anxiously, glancing up the way they came before swinging off to the ground, keeping a hand resting on the brown's side at all times. Dak starts twitching his head back and forth, looking wildly from one dragon and the other and then back out, as if thinking about daring the trip back out.

Gallifreth finally, oh so carefully, folds his wings against his back. Perhaps he folds his wings too carefully, but the blue doesn't complain about any pain or discomfort and noses K'thin away any time the man tries to get close enough to examine the blue. << I am fine. Check on your team. Make sure they are alright, I will do the same. >> He sends K'thin off with a nudge and swivels his head over to eye Veveshoth. << We are safe in here, but we must make sure everyone is fine. >> He eyes the skies and counts the weyrlings around him. << They will not miss anything. We will be safe here. >> So sure, so confident, someone has to be! The blue smirks at his brother. << Mine did wonderfully. He rode bulls, so nothing scares him! >> K'thin rushes towards Ai'den, crouching down and offering the man a hand. ""Come on Ai'den, let's get up and get deeper in the cave. The cool air will make you feel better."" Gallifreth is worried about Syvia. << Is yours alright Dakhanavarath? She did not get hurt, falling on the ground? >>

Paquith's query is met with some sort of assurances, but the dragon seems to grab onto where it is coming from. What was simply a question, vague and wondering where resolves into something with a bit more clarity. The steam seems to solidify, coalescing into suncat << If any of you die, my I'deni will be cross. And if he is cross, I don't mind. >>
Lisya takes an extra moment or three to check the wingtips, before shaking her head. ""That was bein' way too close, Meliaith - I almost could be seein' your wings against the stone. But it was wonderful, for all that - especially our first flight!"" Excitement is very evident, before she turns to Zerra. ""We're gonna have to practice a lot on turns once we're allowed up together. Is everyone else alright? That was almost as much of a drop as cliff-jumping!""

""I want those looked at; you landed too rough Chiro."" D'yce's tone for once leavesn o room for argument after he checks the dragons knee joints. << Help yours with thoughts of being on steady ground. >> the brown in question suggests to Kaijuth, before a startled and unfortunately loud short burst of trumpeted noise is the response to Paquith. << Are you saying you do not mind if any of us die?? >> Ok, so nerves are a little on edge here. ""Well, I guess we all survived our first mounted ... free fall."" he agrees with Lisy, trying to make light of things. 

Al'tair takes a wall to lean against as he allows himself time to get his head to stop spinning. The ride down was more than a little intense. Eventually, the waves of nausea pass, and the color flushes back into his face, and then some, leaving the blue rider a little red. He meanders slowly back to Veveshoth and scritches an eyeridge, ""Looks like we're safe, Vev. Good flying... just be a little more careful next time, you could have really hurt us."" The blue's eyes whirl to match his hide at the complement, and his thought is tinged with a happy blue, << I was in control the whole time, and as you can see. >> and Veveshoth's head tilts toward Dakhanavarath, << I have kept you more than safe from the ground coming up too fast. >>

The news reaches the minds of those leading the battle against the ancient enemy, that there are flameless weyrlings outside of the safety of the Weyr. It would be ridiculous to dispense with a whole fighting wing to guard over one small section of forest, but the Weyrleader does direct the formations to tighten up above the greenery of the forest and be more alert for any missed patches. The lower wings and the Blackdiamonds will be the guard in that region, the best for sweeping up anything that makes it through the formations of those above. The senior weyrling wings appear with resupply of firestone, those who emerged months ahead of those weyrlings below, only now old enough to assist the older dragons. Yet with all this defense, a trickle of Thread tumbles through, almost hitting the forest canopy when a spear of flame hits it. A golden form can just be seen momentarily, with her rider flicking the tip of her flamethrower away from the leaves before they rise back up into formation above. Blackened ash rains down into the pit.

It's going to be a tough fit.  Aboleoth hasn't the clearance to fit into the gaping hole though he certainly makes a fuss about it.  His antics drops rock debris which B'ane censures him for.  ""Keep to the corridors, out of the light!""  For what light can touch so can Thread.  B'ane remains mounted for a moment longer.  << Keep them safe, Minalth. >> A hale group of dragons overhead from Shaarth's summons has flocked to protect the area where the sink hole is located.  Aboleoth, unwilling to leave the weyrlings, yet no offensive whatsoever, keeps thrashing in place from a short distance away.  B'ane allows his bond this though he suffers for it.

<< Poor weyrling logic. >> Paquith returns, metal-rust tinge to his words as they creep into the hole as a jungle cat would. The sable and the red and the metals molten and harden, but suddenly disappear as the flight aloft is taken up. << Listen to the dragons above you, and learn, kids. >> With that dropped, the bronze's presence lifts and fights.

While Einarth had been moving to make room for his smaller siblings, the bronze lowers his head towards Zerra with a rumble while I'es nods an affirmative before another shift underneath causes him to regard the young dragonet with a critical eye.  ""Did you land too hard?"" << No. >> ""You're sure?"" << I am. >> While the surprise of being below is enough for anyone, when the message from Paquith reaches them, it's relayed to the man who finally scrambles down. 

Kaijuth takes Chironath's words to heart, mostly because he's quite worried about his bond.  ""I'm alright.. Kai.. just, gimme a second.""  He says, stomach rolling.  Flying wasn't quite the pleasant experience it might be to his clutchmates.  Especially not when it involved dropping into a sinkhole where there was every risk that his dragon would be bashed against stone.  He notices a hand in front of his face and looks up to see K'thin.  ""Thanks.""  he says, reaching up to take it for a second as he shifts his weight and stands back up.  He releases a breath frought with indigestion before looking way up.  ""How in the cracked shell are we going to get out of here?""  He nods to K'thin's suggestion of getting deeper in the cave.  

<< Poor weyrling logic, my sphincter. >> Chironath grumbles, not bothering to zing the thought up at Paquith, but also not trying to keep it tightly lidded either. Oops. ""Very carefully, I'm thinking."" Yes, it really is about the only thing that D'yce can think of to say to Ai'den's apt question. 

Zerra gives Lisy a nod and a friendly smile before she moves on, passing her gaze over Chironath, then Kaijuth in turn. ""At least you all kept your dragons in line, guys, you did Ok yknow?"" she rounds off by giving the blue brothers the once over. As threadash filters down the sinkhole though, Minalth sets on alert, snapping and sweeping his wings, as if to steer the harmless ash elsewhere. << Just sit tight, kiddos. Enjoy the sere--dark, dampness. Yeah. >>

Syvia follows B'ane's orders about staying out of the tight, but she really has to convince Dakhanavarath to follow along with her. The brown's twitching increases the more he feels squeezed in with his siblings, a low rumbling coming from him. << Mine's fine. Just fine. It was barely a fall, >> he snaps towards Gallifreth, eyes snapping around to glare at the blue briefly before he turns back to stare at the sky. He snaps towards the falling ash, as if that would help calm him some. ""We don't have to be in here forever. Calm down already,"" Syvia murmurs, turning towards her fellow weyrlings. ""The way out will be easier at least after the Thread goes away.""

A voice from above speaks.  Wouldn't you know it isn't God, but B'ane is haloed in a bright light.  ""Everyone okay down there?  Any injuries?""  Sans Aboleoth, the bronze having presumably Betweened back to the Weyr for a flamethrower and other supplies.  Goggled eyes attempt to stare into the film of shadow and rough rock. 

K'thin gives Ai'den a small, tight lipped smile. ""I think they'll just have to...do it. We can't stay here for the next month or so. Here we go."" He collapses against a stone wall, leaning his head back and taking a couple of very deep breaths as the adrenalin courses through his body. He gives a shudder. ""/That/ was too close. Just..."" He just lets that sentence trail, not even bothering to finish it. Not like it needs finishing. Gallifreth ignores his brown brother's wrath and irritation, just nodding. << Good, I'm glad she's alright. >> The blue goes deeper into the cave system. Normally, he'd be all over exploring the intricacies of something new and unknown, but the threat of Thread is fresh in his mind, and that desire to at least /watch/ it be killed overrides all other desires. << This will be us soon! Think of it! Destroying the enemy instead of hiding under stone. >> He trumpets, the echo reverberating on the stone. ""Gallifreth! You didn't need to do that!""  

Al'tair is shaken from his moderate daze from the man shouting above. He then looks up, along with Veveshoth, and signals that he's okay, and shouts up, ""Just fine here. Just feeling a little sick."" He then looks down around at those that weren't so fortunate to pull out of their dive and have a soft landing. Veveshoth puts out a simple, << All dragons all right? >> to try to do... well, something.

Astride Minalth, Zerra responds to B'ane with a wave of hand and a call out ""We're all fine, no broken bones, B'ane!"" Minalth too, quietly agrees with this in commentry to Aboleoth, before hunkering down, warily watching the dragonlings, like some overzealous beagle."

Training Grounds (#1547DJ)
The grounds here is vivid testimony to the hundreds of thousands of young dragons who have trained here with their riders. Thousands of scuffs and scrapes from dragons' claws have worn the grounds down, as new weyrlings try their wings in first flights. This wide open ground has seen many young riders hard at work, bagging firestone, doing ground drills, and caring for their young dragons.
  It is a winter evening.  Cool winter air touches the world with ice.
You see Sephiroth, Atsuth, and Einarth here.
K'thin, Ai'den, Al'tair, Lisya, Syvia, and I'es are here.
Obvious exits:
Central Bowl       Barracks       Waterfall

The vapor from B'ane's mouth can't keep up with him and it isn't even his fastest Ground Devouring Stride(tm).  The ground is firmer underfoot so more than once the toe of his boot catches on a stuck-fast stone.  Aboleoth exists at a distance but he, too, is approaching at an even clip.  

Morning is usually a pretty busy time for the Weyrlings, and at least for Ai'den, now is no exception.  The man is busy going through formations with Kaijuth, mounted up on the bronze as the dragonet walks off the paces and visualizes what his position would be relative to the wing.  So yes, likewise a visualization practice. And, an exercise, for the dragon's wings are out to either side, flapping in a slow, stretching pattern, as he moves.  Ai'den notices B'ane crossing the training grounds at a rapid clip and taps Kaijuth on the shoulder to bring the dragon to a stop. 

From out of nowhere, Q'luin is there, standing in the shadows of the cliff, back casually pressed against cool stone as he watches and waits.  Zhoreth can be seen in the distance of the feeding pens finishing off a meal.  

K'thin and Gallifreth have been working hard, practicing drill formations. They are a distance away from Kaijuth and Ai'den, practicing a different move set. The blue's wings have undergone /another/ growth spurt, and he doesn't quite seem to know what to do with the extra length. ""You haven't gotten used to this strange growth spurt thing yet?"" K'thin grumbles as the blue's wing tips brush the ground yet again. Gallifreth rumbles, annoyed. << It's different every time. >> His tail is thrashing back and forth, he's moving his wings in choppy motions, and he just generally seems moody and grumpy today. Kel sighs. ""Let's try it again."" They begin repeating the exercise, though both notice B'ane and keep an eye on him.

D'yce and Chironath have just stopped their own practice formations; the former hopping off the side of the latter to start inspecting straps as thoroughly as if they were under a microscope. One can never be too safe, especially with the way the dragonets are all growing. << Needs more padding just under this foreleg. >> Lifting said appendage from the ground in explanation, the brown is quick to trumpet a hello to the approaching Aboleoth and B'ane. ""Morning, sir."" No, he's not cheerful or anything. But who would be having to trudge around in weather that produces a vapor trail, really? 

Other weyrlings may be busy, but Al'tair is having a rather lazy morning. With a yawn and a stretch, he makes his way out toward the training grounds - time to warm up his Veveshoth. The blue rider gives out a short whistle, and the dragon bounds out toward him, and bundle of energy. He stops himself just short of running into his rider, and accepts a proffered eye ridge scritch, excited to start today's drills. However, the strange behavior of B'ane stops the two of them short of actually completing anything, and instead, stare intently to await any development from the puffing man. 

Lisya isn't working on drills with Meliaith, though she's out with the rest of them - instead, the two of them are working on wing excerises (Meliaith), and anatomy (Lisya). Specifically, wing anatomy, using the movements of the wings to name things off, not to mention how they work. Meliaith seems to be very involved with the movements, given she doesn't get distracted with people lurking or entering the area, but between naming off of parts, Lisya's shooting small glances at Meliaith, which allows her to spot the incoming rider.

While talking isn't really encouraged during the drills, the expression that fleetingly crosses I'es's features may betray that he's doing exactly that - to Einarth. The unusually marked has his head turned towards the young man even as he's watching the first group go through the drills. Correctly. Though that doesn't change the fact that recently tested and completed straps adorn the young bronze's neck, where his hand rests with a tilt of his head towards the already in progress training. ""You see the formations,"" he asks, even as the multifacited eyes return to the scene with interest.

While a lot of the weyrlings are off practicing, Dakhanavarath and Syvia have taken the opportunity to go for a morning meal for the former. After a rather messy breakfast, the brown then required a good scrubbing in the lake before he can make his way back to the grounds. His gait is awkward with his uneven growing limbs, and all the more so with Syvia perched up between his neckridges, practicing mounting at least on their way back. There are few low encouring murmurs from the weyrling, along the lines of ""No, it's not bumpy up here."" Liar. Dak stops nearby in the training grounds to allow his lifemate to hop down, whirling eyes watching those that had been or still are practicing formations.

B'ane, born by the seas of Tillek, knows cold.  His attire is much like it usually is: leather, with the exception of buff-colored cotton pants.  He nears and addresses one of I'deni's assistants with, ""I can still take them, right?""  Aboleoth, patient with young things, rolls a metallic garble of sounds for the benefit of the dragonets. The assistant, a blond woman with heavy gray streaks within, nods to confirm.  ""Hullo!"" B'ane's voice, best at its low pitch, climbs the higher register.  ""I'm stealing some of you for an outing. Any volunteers?""  Many leap at that.  ""Too bad, I already picked twelve.""  And the names, those I'deni's staff chose, are read off by the bronzerider.   

I'deni is a belated arrival, or maybe just fashionably late. Paquith comes in on the wing, wheeling around and landing just as hard as he always does. A galloping drop to the earth, nothing that the weyrlings should really take as an example. Solder-edged wings fold to metal sides and I'deni looks out to the weyrlings being chose. ""Ah, seems you picked some of my more stand-out weyrlings."" Take that however you will.

From out of nowhere, Pushing off from the wall, Q'luin ambles forth, striding languidly towards B'ane.  Once he's in close enough proximity not to have to raise his voice, a question comes forth, ""Mind if I come along?""  Zhoreth is in the background rolling along, making lethargic belly-fed progress toward the training grounds.  

A manditory salute is given to the senior riders, even though Ai'den's sure none are really paying attention to such at this point, and Kaijuth twists around to get better sight of B'ane.  The bronze perks, intrigue instantly showing in the way he shifts restlessly from paw to paw before settling down.  << Dragons too?  Right, Ai'den?  Den?  Ai?  Right? >> The young dragon asks quickly.. and loudly.. of his bond.  And of just about anyone else who's willing to listen to his naturally booming voice.  ""An outting huh?""  He falls silent, gripping the saddle lightly as he listens to the names being called off.  ""Me and a forest.""  Pause.  ""And you.""  He looks down at Kaijuth.  ""What could possibly go wrong?""

Just as Veveshoth is about to take off, ready for some practice on wing, out comes Al'tair's name. ""So much for being volunteers,"" mutters the rider, emotion being mimicked by his now dissappointed blue, who's eyes are now whorling a sickly green and coming out of his launching pose. The two swagger up to meet B'ane, and the man offers a salute to B'ane. ""Sir, what is it that we can do for you today?"" Q'luin's silent entrance startles the pair, and Al'tair lets out an audible gasp with a jump 6 inches to the side. ""Bah!""

D'yce can appreciate the dry humor behind asking for volunteers and then refusing them, really. Maybe it's a little less amusing when he winds up one of the voluntolds, though. << Maybe we should take a healer, too. A human healer to go with the dragonhealer. >> Chiro's laconic gaze swings first towards the dragonhealing duo that asks to join. And then back at B'ane, and then I'deni and Paquith. << Maybe two. >> he surmises, as the crew starts to form that will be going. Because somehow this group always finds lots of trouble. ""What will we be doing?"" Just as he was done dismounting and checking straps he has to climb back up again for whatever lay in store. 

Lisya perks up, only slightly less so than Meliaith, as there are several words bandied about, the most important two being 'outing' and 'forest'. So what if they are by two different people. Lisya turns to head towards the rider, curiousity evident, even as Meliaith warbles delightedly at the very idea. << Where are we going? It isn't breakable is it? No breaking things, Kaijuth! >>

Gallifreth and K'thin hear their names called and make their way over to the bronzerider. Gallifreth looks quite pleased that the drills have stopped for the moment, today is not his day. The blue folds his wings awkwardly; he just doesn't know where to put all that extra growth. Kel gives a brisk salute to all of the senior rider pairs, a nervous smile on his face. ""An outing? Should make the day more interesting, at the very least."" Gallifreth chuckles at the talk of bringing healers. << These are bronzeriders, I'm sure they wouldn't do something to put us in danger. Though, I suppose a little caution is warranted. >> The blue turns a whirring eye on Kaijuth, and if dragons could grin, he would be. << And I'm sure they wouldn't take yours somewhere without you, brother. >>

S'tao is just a silhouette in the distance, off along the side of the weyr bowl near the guard practice area as usual. From the vantage point of his dragon's shoulders, he gets a pretty good viewing of most of Ista. Just keeping an eye out towards any problem spots so to speak, but otherwise it's life as usual outside of the chaos of the weyrling zone. 

With the mention of an outing, where Einarth's attention was on those training formations with an undercurrent of eagerness and wanting to be out -there- rather than -sidelined-. All of that changes with a lifting of his head towards B'ane. Even I'es' attention shifts into unconscious straightening while a rumble briefly punctuates, whether intentional or not, << Breakable? Why would we be breaking things? >> Of course, he'd want to sign up if it was warranted breaking.

Dakhanavarath's hooked tail comes around to nearly trip Syvia off her feet, who was too busy being distracted by a loose thread from her jumpsuit. ""What-- what is it? Oh! Sir,"" she says, finally spotting the Riders out there, no less the Weyrlingmaster too. She snaps salutes to them, coming around to stand in front of her brown and snapping a quick glare to him. He could have gotten her attention better. ""Us?"" Whether she is replying to B'ane when she hears her name or I'deni, who knows, but she nods nonetheless, even if her eyes slide towards specific dragons called on as well with a wary look. The brown looks on with increasing amusement, turning his gaze upon the cautious Chironath. << I think we're well equipped how we are. If something goes wrong, Kaijuth will just stomp on it until it goes away. >> Human, wild dog, or whatever... that's a good way of making things disappear.

The eager greetings and salutes touch the stoic bronzerider to where he's throwing his own salutes and mildly beaming.  After reading the names off the list, ""your dragons will be pitted against small things that scurry in the forest and you guys can breathe air that doesn't smell of dragon defecation.  I'm B'ane, by the way and that's Aboleoth.""  The hook-muzzled bronze looks ready to fly at the slightest provocation.  ""Let's go. Oh!""  The former Weyrlingmaster amends, ""and form three columns of four.  Might as well practice your formations.""  

You feel soft mental reassurance as you mount your dragon.

Veveshoth trumpets at the chance to formation, until he is reminded by Al'tair, ""We are in the back, Vev. You and Gallifreth."" He sighs, knowing what being put next to Gallifreth means for the trek. Veveshoth quickly jumps into place, attempting to ensure, beyond shadow of a doubt, that he arrives to his spot first, << Hah, Galli! I bet that I'll take care of more of those scurrying furry things than you! >> His rider chimes in with the usual (and to no avail), ""It's not a contest Veveshoth, take things easy."" Veveshoth just snorts and shifts around in his spot noisily. << Let's get a move on! >>

<< Stomping just makes it messy. Not gone. >> Chironath retorts, making a mental face at Dakhanavarath that's suspiciusly similar to comically crossed eyes. He's being playful rather then mendacious at least. However, as he projects he's also following direction to get in line for the proscribed formation; steps precise, wings tucked, doing his best to be the perfect little brownling. Disgusting, really. 

B'ane motions Q'luin along because chances are, after I'deni's 'stand-out weyrlings' bit, B'ane'll need the back-up.

And so B'ane becomes a god in Kaijuth's eyes.  Eyes that seem to widen and grow a watery blue-green in pure elation as the man says 'pitted against small things that scurry in the forest'.  Not to mention, Meliaith said something about breaking things, he hadn't really been paying attention.  Which equates instantly to Kaijuth getting to DESTROY something.  Legally!  The bronze's rumble turns into an outright ROAR, accompanied by rearing back on his hind legs and stomping at the ground.  Yes, this is Kaijuth excited.  It's a scary, if beautiful sight.  But what he says is some sort of hybrid of Dakhanavarath's words.  << Kaijuth stomp forest away! >> With that, the dragonet starts to charge forth, to get with the stomping already, only to be reined in not by his rider, but by th
(pose lost)

Forest
The cooling, salty sea breeze rustles the foliage with a gentle susurration in this more open part of the forest.  While the jungle still remains, tendrils extending out over the rocks and vines twining about the trees, it's less sheltered than the steamy hothouse atmosphere of the interior: hotter at noon, cooler at more temperate times.  In short, it's perhaps the perfect place to sling a hammock and while away the day, watching the glitter of the ocean in the distance.
The trail continues from north to south, the shoreline curving to meet it.
  It is a winter evening.  Cool winter air touches the world with ice.
You see Chironath, Shaarth, Veveshoth, Gallifreth, Meliaith, and Kaijuth here.
S'tao, D'yce, Al'tair, K'thin, E'siac, Ai'den, Lisya, and Syvia are here.
Obvious exits:
North       Beach       Sink Hole

K'thin can't help but smile at the older bronze rider. He nods as B'ane gives his directions and taps Gallifreth's shoulder, directing the blue to move to his spot in the formation. He gets in the back, where his spot is, and waits. The blue pair manages to get to the correct location without breaking formation, and Kel pats the blue. ""Good job Gallifreth."" Gallifreth, meanwhile, has /words/ for Veveshoth. << Gallifreth, if you please. Yours is right, this is not a contest. We will work together, like we will be when we join fighting wings. >>

Q'luin and Zhoreth take up the ass end of the walking group, slipping back even further when the trail narrows and the dragon's butt becomes too large for side-by-side passage.  One of the lucky twelve hangs back due to little-leg progress, keeping the older pair entertained with constant, ""Come on, Gonzo, move faster, you're embarrassing us!""  The blue pays little attention to his rider as every single new thing they pass gets a sniff or a taste test.  

Dakhanavarath slipped into formation after a little prodding from Syvia, but he does so nonetheless and looks lopsided along with his clutchsiblings. << Things crushed are things you no longer have to worry about. Can we take any of these scurrying small things back with us? >> The brown curiously watches around him, always tempted to break the formation if only to go exploring to new spots that he hadn't been before. But no, not with Syvia, who constantly keeps them on track along with the rest of the weyrling group.

Though Aboleoth had every moral reason to fly to the designated location, B'ane was convincing.  The fair-sized bronze keeps his walking lope slower though he's not at the head of the pack.  They keep to the left side where the bulk of weyrlings can stay in view.  The morning weather is fair and slightly warmer by the sea, but Ista's still gripped by the cool season.  << B'ane wants to see if they know enough to go single file.  A quarter mark? >>  B'ane places a bet with Q'luin through Aboleoth.

Meliaith is constantly distracted, as the group starts to move out beyond the known and boring bounderies of their previously understood world, even though she's more towards the back than not. << Maybe we will be bringing more things back for Lisya-flower's greenhouses. Then they will be ready when it is time for our weyr. Oh, look! I have not seen that plant before. Is it edible? >> The half-grown dragon moves her head like she is going to break formation to go investigate, when Lisya thumps her lightly. ""Don't even be thinkin' it - we've no place to put it yet, and 'sides. Formation. Can't be going willynilly, y'know..."" There is a pause, then the weyrling is pinching her nose. ""An' you can't be eatin' it.""

Settled into formation near enough to the front, Einarth is firmly of the mindset that this is where they belong with his head lifted higher as I'es presses his lips together ruefully together with intermittent twinges of a smile. Even as he hears and feels the rumble underneath from time to time as his bond sees more of the island, taking time to reply to his clutchsibling, << Why would we bring anything back with us? Are they big enough to eat? >>

<< Half.  They're clever and if one remembers, they will all. >> Zhoreth sounds pleased and proud like the grandpop he is.  Q'luin simply grins in response, keen black eyes piercing the early morning shadows brought on by the thick canopy to watch the weyrlings a tad closer, willing them to fall in line.  

Disgruntled with his location in the back, Veveshoth attempts to get the group moving faster by getting closer and closer to the dragon ahead of him, << Hurry it up! You're all so slow... >> Al'tair gives his dragon a sharp thwomp, ""We'll get there when we get there. Formation is important, especially when it comes to doing things like, oh, I dunno, not getting hit by thread?"" Veveshoth shakes his head gently, eyes a reddish orange, << And why would I be the one to get hit? I am more competent than Galli/freth/ >> and emphasis is place on the last syllable << In the air, afterall. >> Al'tair, again, gives his dragon another scolding, ""We'll see about that when it comes to the real deal.""

When it comes down to it, it's a lucky thing that Ai'den can keep Kaijuth moving.  The bronze, unerringly wants to stop at those points when the path narrows and it becomes nearly impossible for those behind him to get by.  Much prodding (and promising of getting to squish things) sees Kaijuth onward however.  The bronze keeps hearing things like 'edible' and 'taking stuff back' and so inevitably comes to a stop at one point and reaches up, muzzle crunching hard around a thick tree limb that looked fairly interesting.  He worries at it for a moment, trying to break it off, or perhaps strip all the bark from it's length.  And then.. he gets an owie.  A (huge) splinter pressed up between two teeth and into his gumline.  He yelps and releases the tree, growling at it as he jogs to catch up with Einarth, wanting to stick closer to his big bronze leader brother type.  << Oooh it hurts.  The tree bit me! >> The tree's bite, was in fact worse then it's bark.  As the dragonet walks along, tail occasionally lashing out fiercely behind him, his tongue tries to remove the splinter, giving him the appearance of chewing on cud.

K'thin sees the narrow trail up ahead, and a knowing, defeated expression crosses his face. It seems that /he/ has little faith in the weyrling group. Gallifreth's tail twitches faster and faster; he too sees the problem and is waiting for /someone/ to say something, or get organized. Finally, though it really doesn't take that long, the impatient blue barks out from the back of the line. << Hey! Narrow trail coming up! Single file perhaps! Yeah, that sounds like a good plan. >> Unfortunately, from the back, that's all the blue can do. It's up to the bronzes and browns up front to make sense of the trail. Gallifreth ignores Veveshoth and his prodding, though he does rumble. Somebody's cranky today. Kel reaches down to sooth the beast. << Something feels....wrong. >> 

Chironath loves all his clutchsibs with all of his heart, Honestly. That's why he heaves a thick sounding sigh when Kaijuth gets his fiber for the day in the way of tree bark. << We will all be eating trees like Kaijuth if we don't change our formation. >> Hint. Hint. << I know! We can move one behind the other -like they already showed us- >> his clarion, sarcastic call, obviously echoes Gallifreth, much to D'yce's amusement. And he ducks his head so that his casual smirk remains momentarily unseen. 

B'ane swivels back in the riding pad to close the deal with Q'luin with a casual left-handed salute and sizeable grin.  They're just about at their destination, the trees are larger and showing more growth rings.  Nourished by large amounts of rainfall the vegetation is thick, but there is patch of ground to the northwest where Thread burrowed last Turn.  

Meliaith bugles at Kaijuth, << What did that tree do to you! Stop picking on it! You'd better do what /Gallifreth and Chironath/ said, or I'm gonna bite your tail! >> ""... please don't, Meliaith. He eats /rotten fish/."" << So what? >> ""... remember part of Rh'iad's lecture?"" << No? >> Lisya leans forward and whispers something to her dragon. Meliaith just sort of shudders. << .. never mind. >>

<< Trees bite? >> Calmly, even though Einarth isn't without a turn of his muzzle towards the lush forests at times and sending a gust of air towards the branches with an air of disinterest as Kaijuth comes back and closer to him. But it's then that I'es looks ahead with a forward lean to lift himself high enough to see what's going on. << I'es agrees. We can't all get through at once. >> Ah. Out of the mouths of humans. Better that one's looking ahead out of the pair, proceeding onwards into more... greenery. << The entire island is like this? >>

Veveshoth attempts to cut Gallifreth off at the single file change, but doesn't quite make it, and instead ends up scraping up against a tree while falling back. The blue warbles out, attempting to garner pity where there will most likely be none, and rumbles unhappily at the happenings. Al'tair shouts to Veveshoth, ""Careful! You're being as clumsy as Kaijuth... No offense intended Kaijuth. Chill out, Vev, you're going to get yourself seriously hurt here. We're not even there yet."" The blue just bugles discontentedly at his rider, just hoping to get the last word in edgewise. 

One of those uglier than a canine's butt tunnelsnakes stupidly trots a course across Zhoreth's path and becomes purposeful putty beneath the pressure of a paw as it descends with a thump that resounds through the immediate vicinity.  A pause to shake it off culminates in Q'luin having to pry it free with his knife from where it oozes between toes and a bone sticks in a toughened crevice.  

Aboleoth's gait lengthens and he takes a spot near the front of the troop-- after chosing a selective path around a stand of thick cycads.  ""Here!  Break rank and enjoy yourselves.""  The soil is lush, but thin here and shallow, leaf-filled puddles are a common occurance.  The older rider dismounts without any sign of weakness in his fifty Turns.  Several firelizards call to one another in the treetops, both wild and domesticated alike. 

Fortunately, Kaijuth is a follower.  He hadn't been told to be in formation, and so he wasn't, but he /is/ a short distance from Einarth's tail, watching as the shiny bronze thing swishes back and forth as he walks.  Baaaack.. and forth.  If it weren't moving, Kaijuth wouldn't be.  As it is, Einarth's tail is now the carrot on the end of a pole and the young dragonet follows happily.  Even as he seems to be chewing cud, with drool frothing over the edge of his muzzle lips and spilling to the forest floor below. This means, of course, that he's the best of them all, because he was /already/ in single-file formation.  At least, that's what Ai'den's going to claim, with full rights.  He needs -something- to distract him from his dragon's slurping noises and slightly swaying gait.  Baaaack.. and forth.  Dakhanavarath's words snap his attention off of his brother's tail however, much to the detriment of..well, everyone behind him.  Considering Einarth's in the lead, and he's behind his brother, that means everyone's going to have to come to a stop (or run into some bum) as Kaijuth's head arches up and over to peer behind him, red-eyed.  << Kill tree! >> 

The tunnelsnake parts are tossed at the advancing E'siac, while Zhoreth rumbles a greeting as he rolls back into action, moving forward until the path opens up and the weyrlings are unleashed.  At this point they amble on towards B'ane through the crowd, coming up next to him with a grin, ""I think we both lost.""  

Gallifreth manages to get ahead of Veveshoth, and he does it by being calm and staying in formation. Needless to say, this thrills the blue and perks him up immediately. Despite his awkward wings, he hasn't managed to injure himself yet, which is a little bit of a minor miracle. The interruption of the brown in the tree and Kaijuth's sudden stop return the blue's foul mood. << We can keep going? Come on everyone! The faster we move, the sooner we get to where we're going, and /that/ will be much more interesting than this trail. >> K'thin just pats the blue, trying to sooth the temper that's brewing. ""Hush Gallifreth, we can explore now, B'ane said so."" The blue chuffs and breaks rank, stopping to look at a flowering bush. Something about the large, brilliant white flowers seems to calm him down. << Like stars. Flowers like stars! How interesting. >>

<< Please don't make Meliaith hurt you, Kaijuth. The tree is not really going to attack you. >> Chironath swings his stare back at Dak, both bemused and exasperated perhaps. And Gallifreth, he gets a companionable whuffle. The large brown muzzle and accompanying that appear through the trees cause a sudden stop and stare. ""... Hello..."" Surprise tinges the tone, but oh he is soooooo glad to be freed now to explore a bit and wander around. << Stars? What looks like stars? D'yce loves looking at stars. >> And he ambles forward, careful not to jostle his rider too much. 

""Us? Trouble? Whatever do you mean, E'siac, Sir?"" Lisya calls out with a bit of a grin, as she dismounts once they get to their location. Meliaith nudges at her rider, almost knocking her back, before she moves off to explore. ""So, not to be bein' horribly curious, Sir,"" Lisya starts to B'ane, ""But I am - curious, that's bein'. Are we just here to be explorin', or are there other things to be doing?"" Luckly, Meliaith's already forgotten about her threat, as she moves off to examine these flowers.

It's not good that Einarth's that close to Kaijuth. Really. Alas, I'es doesn't have eyes in the back of his head to see how close everyone is. Times like this, a firelizard would be handy. Pernese rearview. Stopping abruptly at Kaijuth's warning cry, both dragon and rider glance over one shoulder and the other? Towards the respective.. ah, trees. << Which one? I see nothing here to fight that hasn't attacked us first. They say we're at our destination. >> So much happening at once, E'siac's greeting is noted with a quick two fingered salute before the young man quickly looks back to Ai'den. ""What does he want to do? Eat a tree, Ai'den?""

<< Enjoy ourselves? I didn't come all the way out here to enjoy myself. >> Veveshoth can never be contented, it is a fact! He breaks rank and goes off to sulk on his own. << I'm no Kaijuth, I don't derive fun from eating a tree like Galli, and enjoy the flowers. >> It is a forest that they are in, however, and that means small animals. A tunnelsnake burrows out nearby, and as has become near second nature to the blue, he immediately out and squashes it, slowly grinding it to a bloody pulp beneath his foot. ""Must you be so thorough, Veveshoth?"" Al'tair asks his blue, to which he gets an immediate reply, << I do not like tunnelsnakes. >>

And why, since they aren't really on the WLM payroll, are Minalth and his Little Red Rider doing here? Zerra won't offer an explanation. But they have hitched along, the turtling brown finding the going very uneasy on such soft, foliaged terrain, his shoulders rocking side to side. << Whats with the mud. Oh look, Shaarth- bruddah, check out how damp it is. No sand here >> Ahh the running commentry, complete with didgeridoo-thrums as the brown comes to a stop in a more open part of the path. 

Ai'den glares in Dakhanavarath's direction for that bit about the killer trees, something that it'd take him hours to convince his dragon wouldn't happen, then pats his bronze's side.  ""It's alright, Kai.  Lets just keep going and.. No, Shaarth is not a killer tree."" Pause.  ""Yes, he's brown but.. no. No you can't taste him to find out.  Will you just.. Go!""  That doesn't work so well as everyone else fussing at him.  Kaijuth's growl fades to a frustrated whimper as he continues plodding along and into that clearing of sorts.  After a bit, he stops and lets Ai'den slide to the ground before lowering his muzzle.  The man works at getting the splinter wedged in the dragon's mouth out.  ""I don't know.""  He says to I'es.  ""I think I'm giving up on trying to figure out just how this boy's mind works."" 
 
B'ane feels something brush an earlobe and chases a limp leaf off of his head.  He's actively looking for a fruit tree as Lisya's asks her question.  ""I told your Weyrlingmaster we'd squeeze at least one drill in and I am a man of my word.  But we've all day and the weather's fine.  Go have some fun.""  He bares a small smile and looks over the weyrling's head to where Q'luin stands.  ""It was worth a shot, eh?""

D'yce is happy to let Chironath poke around at flowers, so long as the brown doesn't notice the tunnelsnakes around him. That might send him into a killing frenzy that would rival Kaijuth. So, he decides to just keep a bit of a watch around them for now with his knife out and ready to stab one of the little buggers if they get too close. ""Hey Zerra!"" The other hand lifts in a wave, while careful steps bring him closer to Dak and Syvia. ""Hey, maybe you can find some plant clippings to take back. Start growing them now, so they'll be ready for when you have a ledge to put them on.""

<< Gallifreth. My name is Gallifreth, Veveshoth. >> The blue mildly corrects his blue brother /again/. He turns his attention back to the flowers he's been looking at. << Yes! These flowers look like /stars/! They're white and they look pointy like and they cover the bush randomly. They don't sparkle, but I wouldn't expect flowers to twinkle... >> The commentary goes on for a bit, and K'thin slides from his perch atop the blue, dusting off his hands as he gracefully lands. He too goes to explore, looking for a fruit tree as well, if the grumbling coming from his stomach is any indication of his current state. He finds himself near Ai'den and I'es. ""Is Kaijuth's mouth alright? The splinter didn't pierce too deep did it?"" Yes, Kel knows about the splinter, Gallifreth was scrupulous in his relaying of the draconic conversations.

""I feel like I haven't been out here in Turns,"" Syvia mentions, more to herself as she takes in the forest around her. Too many months needing to stick by her lifemate, she definitely is glad to finally be out and about as well as some of the others. She looks sheepishly back at Ai'den when she catches him glaring, smiling at the man in apology. The forest can wait, Dakhanavarath does his best innocent look right back at Chironath even as he stops to let down an eager Syvia. ""I'm not so sure about clippings, but I will want to grab a few samples. Maybe find some seeds to save for a later date,"" she says, grinning broadly towards D'yce at his suggestion, glancing back as if worried to leave Dak alone. The brown simply lounges at first, poking a talong into a puddle curiously, letting a few long moments of silence go from him, before... << The tree! It moved! >> Comes his startled voice towards Kaijuth. Oops, was he supposed to be good? Syv doesn't catch it right away, but there is a hissed, ""Dak!"" to her lifemate.

""You'll figure it out,"" I'es offers encouragingly to Ai'den as he swings down from Einarth's neck, the metallic bronze slowly but surely making his way forward with a look here and there. New place. New scents and.. new firelizards. With a firm slap of one palm against his bond's hide, the same hand finally lifts to run through his hair as he regards the splinter removal efforts a bit more closely. ""It's not wedged up there too tightly, hopefully,"" he asks, lifting one hand towards K'thin in a wave before regarding the other dragons milling about. ""I don't think  Einarth wants a keepsake from here, but what about the others? I heard something about planting?"" Zerra's arrival on the ground is noted with a brief nod in greeting. 

Lisya grins at B'ane, ""A marvelous plan then!"" And she's off and racing back towards Meliaith and the others, peering at the flowers. "".. we might be able to be stealin' a pot in the Weyrgarden - it's not mine, Meliaith - an' maybe by the time we get our own space, there'd be enough for us all?"" she asks Syvia, before turning and spotting Zerra. A wave is given, and a bright grin shown, while Meliaith tries to eat one of the flowers. There's a pause, then << That did not taste good. >>

Q'luin returns a nod to B'ane and then wanders off, while Zhoreth remains near the older bronze, settling down into a lush patch of jungle moss for the duration.  The dragonhealer ambles over towards the density of the wall of trees about them and disappears for a quick leak break.  

""Hi D'yce!"" Zerra calls out a greeting with a waved hand towards the one-time-NerdCrafter. Unlike the others, she elects to stay seated. High and dry on Mini-man's broad shoulders, with a comfy neckridge to lounge back against. Seems Minalth isn't bothered about the mud, but is distractingly drawn into draconic conversation << Trees don't move, man >> he shares, the heat of an outback summer warming his words << But wriggly things -in- trees do. Hear about Worrith? Went wandering in the forest and had a slug thing burrow right up into his bu--- >> ""Minalth, cut it out"" Zerra is vocal in her remonstrance, though she is trying to suppress laughter. ""Heyla, Lisy! Hey!"" change topic to hopefully bring her dragon along with it << --true story. Meliaith. Mum-type. Nice flowers, petal! >> Thankfully the tactic works.

<< Yes, it was the wind! >> Chironath tries to tack on to Dakhanavarath's sending, prior to the big bronze running off to slaughter the big bad... tree. << Yes, I can see how the pattern looks like something that would be up in the sky. >> he agrees then, nodding companionably towards Gallifreth before he starts to sidle over in the field. You know, between Kaijuth and the forest. ""Seeds? What kind of seeds?"" Oblivious to the peril of the moment, Dayce takes a deep breath of the much fresher air out here in the woods. ""Haven't been out here before, actually. It's nicer then I thought."" 

""It's in there, but..  I think I almost..""  Kaijuth tries to hold still.  Really, he does.  But as soon as Dakhanavarath sends him that message, the bronze's jaw snaps shut and swings around, hisssssing and glaring at the trees all around.  << Which one?  Which one! >>  The bronze doesn't say, he booms!  With a crashing, clanking roar of rage.  In the meantime, Ai'den, barely having missed getting snapped in half by his dragon's own sharp teeth, is sitting on his butt on the ground.  He'd fallen there after jerking quickly out of Kaijuth's mouth to avoid becoming dragonkibble.  Trying to bring his breathing and adrenaline levels down to normal, he once more shoots a glare not at Syvia, but at her brown.  In the meantime, Kaijuth enjoys himself by stomp-walking over to the clearing's treeline and challenging a tree.  Which involves hunkering down and glaring at it with swiftly whirling red eyes.  He was going to -see- it move, and he was going to protect them all, just you wait and see.  Ai'den looks back around to his dragon before his shoulders slump and he laughs, just..giving up.  ""Well, he'll be at that for a while.""  he pushes up, brushing off his butt."

Inner Courtyard (#2592J)
A roofed, ivy-columned walkway outlines this lush garden, its glazed tiles of cream and blue echoing the yet more colorful tropical display that blossoms within its bounds.  Tall silver-barked trees, their leaves rustling quietly in any breeze, provide treasured shade to winding brick paths and benches secluded for studying, inspiration, or simply relaxation; their overhanging branches likewise shelter delicate floral beds from the full onslaught of Boll's notorious surprise downpours. In less humid weather, fabric fresh from washing or dyeing flutters from clotheslines, the varied colors as brilliant as the scenery that served as inspiration.
Arches within the walkway lead to other areas of the Hall.
  It is a winter afternoon.  It is unusually cool and overcast.
Liadan is here.
Obvious exits:
Dining Area       Dormitory Hall       Main Workroom       Entrance Hall       Offices

The afterglow of the successful fashion show /and/ booth sales is still in place. Liadan, as a result, has been spending a lot of time out in her favorite workspace, sketching up a storm of fashion designs. Today is no exception. She's seated on a bench, slouched slightly to support her sketchbook in her lap as she doodles. There's a small cloth with bread and cheeses on it next to her that she grazes on at times.

Two apprentices have confronted an Istan dragonrider in the span between his bronze in the courtyard and this inner asylum, and at least one journeyman looked ready to swoop.  B'ane thereby boosted his pace to make it look there was purpose when there is none to speak of.  Once he reaches the plant-infused area the man allows his feet to slow because it's quite an impressive presentation.  He's gaping freely through colored goggles and after a while gets Liadan in sight.  His approach is nigh soundless.  ""Fine place to work, here.""

New people, espectially riders, often mean comissions and often people end up pounced. Liadan, however, has her plate pretty full right now and it's a lovely thing. It affords her the time to relax and pretty things for herself. Like meals at the Passionfruit Pit, or special materials to work with. She blinks a few times -- surprised, but not overly so outwardly -- before glancing up at B'ane. She studies the man for a moment, giving him her usual once over; focus primarily on attire. ""I've always thought so. Can I help you?""

B'ane makes a short journey to the shade of a broad-leafed tree that offers the security of shade.  The dark goggles are removed from his face and strung along his belt.  In the transit he tries to steal glances at what it is the apprentice is conceiving in the sketch.  ""How would you rate my style in your personal opinion?""  Arms and legs splay to best showcase what he's wearing.   

Liadan smirks briefly, but sits up a bit straighter. She pops a cube of cheese between her lips and chews languidly as she considers the rider. ""Fairly standard for a dragonrider, I'd have to say,"" she ventures, cocking head to one side. ""Bronzerider, possibly brown. Greenriders often end up with a lot of color, either due to their own tastes or their lifemate's insistance. Blueriders also can be varied... I most often see the bronze and brownriders in more monochrome."" A pause and with a quirked eyebrow, she returns her gaze to B'ane's features. ""Not that it's a bad thing, mind you. It helps set that tone that the Holders have come to respect.""

B'ane pulls his lips down from a reaction to the weaver's astute degree perception.  ""Not bad, not bad.  You have me pegged.  Bronzerider for what it's worth.  But I gotta admit I can't remember the last time I bought a tunic nor jacket that wasn't plain.""  He comes to lean against the broad-leafed tree's trunk, facing Liadan and preparing to continue the chat.  ""I can't say I'm flamboyant,""  B'ane admits honestly.  ""Tell me, would you change anything?""  The big man is almost boyish in his acquisition of opinion.

""If plain is your style, then it's your style. However, I wouldn't quite use the term plain."" Liadan pauses a moment to eat some more cheese as she considers B'ane. ""Mmm... you want simple, basic. Elegant, but you're not the type to use that term, are you?"" Another glance to his features, then back to the rider as a whole. ""Basics, such as black, white, grays... Or other solid, but muted colors can be touched up with..."" She gestures a little as she goes on. ""Different cuts, subtle embroidery. Things of that nature. For you? Well, it would depend on the look you're going for, but just /my/ opinion?"" She worries her lip a moment, placing hands flat in lap over her sketchbook. ""Tunics with a slight v-neck, instead of a round one. Not much of a v, of course, just a slight one to tone down your shoulders. You're strong, but you don't want it to be all people notice?"" She scratches at her cheek a bit. ""And embroidery on your jacket. It could even be black over black, so only someone up close would notice. Perhaps your wing's emblem over the breast, or a likeness of your lifemate on the back. Really... ah... minimal embroidery. Few lines, just enough to invoke the idea and in the same color as the fabric is very elegant.""

Greek, Afrikaan, Mandarin, B'ane witnesses a similarly new language in the making: the Clothier's.  ""Basic is, I think I had a v-neck or I at least- my strength?""  He sorely tries to mark all the suggestions and conjugations in his head but is overwhelmed in no time.  Nodding, himself eagerly convinced, ""I could do beige.  Maybe even ecru!  Hey, do you think orange would be too much?  Not, like, the bright stuff but something similar to 'sunset'."" Hands set on his hips.  ""I think I could pull that off.""  And he's chewing a lip thinking about the possibilities.  ""You know, I had this bright red tunic once and I kinda liked that.""

Liadan is used to it, by the expression on her face. She's caught somewhere in that creative stage, so it's difficult to phase her. She's not sure if B'ane is making fun, but she seems to take it as if he's being completely serious. ""Mmm, red is a wonderful color. Full of passion."" She looks him over, ""Oranges, I'm not so sure of. Stick with the darker colors, but that doesn't mean you can't be bold."" And then a wave of the hand, ""Your lifemate, bronze, yes, but what shade? Nothing's better for a fashionable rider than to compliment their lifemate.""

The shocking thing is B'ane is wholly serious and is possessed by one of his intrigued moods which can involve erratic periods of mania.  ""Yea, never did like orange that much.  I mean only gourds can really pull it off.""  One hand starts to fly with with each thoughtful expression.  ""Aboleoth? He's got browns in him, a little aged green, oh and some gold in his legs. You think beige would go with that?""  Leaf litter is stepped on as B'ane roams the short space under the tree's canopy.

""Well, beige goes with just about everything,"" Liadan points out. Her eyes take on a distant look as she considers the colors B'ane has described in his lifemate. ""Mmm... He sounds almost like the trees look just at the beginning of autumn, maybe during a sunset. There's still green there, but some browns and golds as the leaves turn... Yellow or red would go wonderfully, especially in darker, almost aged shades.""

Sound manifests from the abrupt clap B'ane executes.  ""I like those ideas.  You know, you're a very good weaver- what's your name?  Some apprentices have glows for brains but you, you have a future."" Not even a millisecond lapses before the bronzerider's moving on.  ""You think you can come outside the Hall?  Call it my first request.""

""I'd like to think I am,"" Liadan responds, lips quirking in mild amusement. ""Did you see the fashion show and Weaver booth at Fort's gala? Largely my work and the organization all my doing."" She eats another couple pieces of cheese, studying him in mild confusion at the request. ""Well, certainly. Just allow me to gather up my things."" This doesn't take long: the sketchbook and drawing supplies are tucked into a bag, while the remaining food is wrapped back up and put into a pouch at her belt. Soon she is ready. ""Lead the way?"" That slight smirk still remains as mild bemusement reaches her hazel eyes as well.

B'ane doesn't wait to confront Rukbat head on.  The optic glasses over a hip are tightened back over his face expertly.  Call it practice.  ""I haven't gone to Fort since Interval.  I mean, it seems like Interval.""  He corrects sheepishly, minding this timeline.  ""But I heard several people in Ista say they went and that they weren't disappointed.  Can't imagine anyone would balk at free wine and wherry though.""  His grin, when genuine, totally converts his face.  ""But good on you.""  Lead he does, in large controlled steps.

Her usual bag is easily slung across chest and shoulder after a few steps and Liadan falls into line after B'ane. Bemusement mixes with curiousity, but all in all she keeps the expression steady. ""That's a shame,"" she offers. ""Fort has some lovely people."" And some terrifying ones, but she doesn't add that. ""Is Ista planning any kind of gala or similar? I'd love to host a fashion show there, too. The clothing and styles would be completely different, based on the climate.""

You catch a brief whiff of rose as you enter, wood glistening underfoot.
Entrance Hall (#2584J)
Wide, tall windows surround this airy, well-lit room, affording a spectacular view of Southern Boll's jungles when the shutters are drawn wide; fine netting keeps out bugs, if not the omnipresent firelizards so fond of perching on tapestries' poles.  In the southeast corner, a large fireplace plays host to an array of sofas and chairs upholstered in lavender and green; nearby, a low table holds an oft-freshened klah pot and several cups, as well as a large bowl of dried rose petals.
A low, lush-loomed carpet shields the clean sweep of mahogany floors along the path from the outer courtyard's doubled doors to, opposite, those that access the craft's main workroom; the southern archway marks the inner courtyard.

Liadan emerges from the Weaverhall.

B'ane treats the carpet reverently when traipsing through the entrance hall.  ""I'm afraid I'm the wrong person to ask about galas.  So long as my dragon can chew stone that's pretty much all I'm good for.""  Aboleoth, however, has more extensive talents.  ""Well.  Here she is.""  Aboleoth, average in bronze limits and squarely built, shudders his wings through gigantic proportions.  They are his best features.  The wind the comes from them bathes the newcomers over and not bowls.  ""This here's Aboleoth.""  B'ane's voice is much less manic, even, and slightly melodious.  

""Ahh, well. I suppose I'll hear something if one is planned,"" Liadan murmurs somewhat to herself. She looks to Aboleoth as B'ane introduces the bronze and blinks rapidly to clear her eyes of the wind. It may not bowl her over, but there's always those dust particles. The goggles make sense now- at least a sense she can find in them. The young woman gives a slight tilt of her head to the dragon, looking him over. ""My, he is like a mountain range in the beginnings of autumn, during a sunset."" Massive, bathed in warm colors. She smirks a little, but it softens into a more proper smile. ""Hello, Aboleoth. I'm Liadan."" 

Aboleoth's shadow consumes Liadan and B'ane, swallows the ground around their feet whole.  He's predominantly a calm dragon outside of mating flights, aloof, but salt of the earth.  He respects the apprentice's space, mostly, and lies down until his elbows meet the grit.  His rider has a ghost of a smile going from beast to young woman.  ""Good sentiments, Liadan.""  Aboleoth practices a trademark sound, subsonic, that isn't heard but felt down to the marrow like earthquake tremors.  ""I thought he'd approve of you helping to mind Isyth's clutch as a candidate.  That is, if you're interested.  I could use the fashion sense close by.""  His laugh is a big 'hmmmp'.

That subsonic tremor raises the hair on Liadan's arms and once she processes what B'ane has said, they stay that way for a moment. She looks from dragon to rider, then back. Her gaze does eventually return to B'ane and for once, the young woman is caught speechless. She clears her throat slightly to avoid the squeak that had been rising. ""Me? A candidate?"" A look to the bronze again. Well, no one in their right mind would disagree with that. ""I... I'd love to."" And to B'ane, as she regains her senses: ""A little work and you'd have the women all over you.""

When Aboleoth cants his head to the side it reveals a dire scar on his jaw time has yet to fully neutralize.  A front foot lifts at the wrist, dragging dirt with every claw.  B'ane's shoulders budge humorously at Liadan's speculations.  ""A little work and you may have the dragons all over you.""  And he likes that comparison.  ""There anything special you need brought?""

""H-ha,"" Liadan responds, managing eventually a chuckle at B'ane's comment. Apparently her first thought wasn't in a good nature. She can see the teeth and claws. Still, it sank in eventually and she relaxes a bit. ""Well... I have a trunk in the dorms. That's really it."" A pause and she blinks. ""I ... suppose we ought to talk to a Journeyman or Master or something too, right? I mean, so they know where I've gone and all."" Because /that'd/ be embarassing. To disappear on dragonback and no one's the wiser.

""Consider it done,"" B'ane, should Liadan look where he is, is already entering the heart of the Hall anew.  Aboleoth calls out again, a metallic clunk slipping up and down his throat.  The new candidate, /his/ candidate, is stared at via a series of different head positions.  Up high, at a sunken angle, and he draws the line at sideways.  Fifteen or so minutes later B'ane is back shouldering a sack of clothing.  ""So Master Dindana begged for two junior apprentices in place of you and a new riding jacket but I told her my mind was made up."" Securing the sack on Aboleoth,  ""ever ridden a dragon before?""

Liadan was quite close to following B'ane, but Aboleoth's call and staring kept her rooted to her spot. When he returns and speaks of Dindana's protests, her lips curve in a smirk. ""Well, it's not like they'd keep me here forever once I managed to net that promotion."" She does cast a glance to the Hall, wondering. That may never happen now. Huh. She baffles for a long moment before B'ane's question gets her attention once more. ""Oh, yes. I often deliver my comissions to the purchaser, so I'll get rides when the watches change out."" There soon appears a small, green 'lizard. Probably disrupted from a nap by Liadan's things being moved. She looks to the small creature, then Aboleoth as she nears the bronze. ""Aboleoth, could you share with my friend here where she can go to meet me at Ista?""

Experience or not B'ane makes an exercise in suggesting where Liadan would best plant her feet and hands.  He allows her the opportunity to be seated first to get the most of the moment's grandeur.  ""Bo's a good flier but he likes his heights.""  Dark eyes watch a green firelizard's arrival to which he confirms, ""I think she's got the picture.  Ready?""  Lia'd better be because neither rider nor dragon waits for an affirmative.  Spreading long silver-spangled wings Aboleoth trots before accelerating drastically. Somewhere around 10,000 feet they cross /between/.

You visualize High Above Central Bowl for Aboleoth.

Aboleoth composes himself for a lapse ::between::

Astride Aboleoth, Liadan does take B'ane's suggestions. Every dragon is different, afterall. And heights, well. They don't seem to phase her- in fact, the weaver looks over towards the ground just before they go between. When they reappear in Ista, she draws in a deep breath to reassert herself. ""You weren't kidding about heights,"" she says with a broad grin. Yes, a little more marked emotion. Apparently she is one of those able to appreciate the thrill of flight.

Aboleoth also adds fair landings to his credentials.  He backwings into the headwind and lands with a slight characteristic bounce.  The bag holding Liadan's current history is worked out of the tethers and convoyed down with B'ane.  For all intensive purposes he'll carry it straight to the candidate barracks.  ""Hey, bronzeriders never lie. Lesson one.""  Or lie one.  ""Here, I'll show you where the barracks are."" 

Candidate's Barracks
The barracks have been given a overhaul, this much is apparent when one first walks into the room. The smell of fresh wood hangs heavy in the air. The cots have been repaired, and lots of new furniture is scattered about. And what isn't new, has visible signs of articulate care, new furniture has been added, and there's a small lounge in one of the corners for candidates to relax in when they don't want to be outside. Various tapestries litter the walls, depicting various events. Candidates standing on the sands before eggs, weyrlings with their dragons, dragons taking flight against thread as it falls from the skies. A crisp, new shade of paint clings to the clean walls of the large, rectangular room. The floor is swept clear of any debris while rows of cots line the outer walls covered with various sized tapestries. Each cot has new orange linen with a white pillow at the head while small chests line at their bases for each candidate's belongings to go into. The fresh scent of new paint permeates throughout the room, giving the impression that a renovation has recently taken place. The barracks are now cleaner and fresher than ever before with white walls, black accents on furniture and almost all the fabrics orange.

Ryli is here.

Out

Liadan moves the curtain from the Lower Caverns, stepping in.

""Respectable ones, perhaps,"" Liadan responds. She's met some certain bronzeriders that she wouldn't be surprised if they lied. A lot. As she follows B'ane to the barracks, her green 'lizard soon appears and takes up perch on her shoulder. She carries the bag she had with her, but since B'ane is so good at carrying the other one, she's leaving him with that. The barracks are stared at for a moment; primarily the tapestries.

B'ane eyes the chamber just as gingerly as Liadan does. He's using protocol a century in advance.  ""Uh, just pick any cot and see the headwoman- name's Mika.  She'll make sure you're acclimated to the Weyr.""  Looking at the new candidate openly, slightly up, ""any questions?""
Liadan picks a cot fairly near the door. First one that's free, actually. She drops her usual carisak on it and moves aside to let B'ane drop the other sack. Clothes, yay! She runs fingertips through her hair as she considers. ""I... guess Mika will tell me what to do?"" A glance around the barracks. ""Is it much different from being an apprentice?""

The barracks have a lot of old ghosts haunting B'ane.  He stays by the door after depositing Liadan's bag by her claimed cot,  coarse fabric keeping the marks of his fist for a time.  ""She will, or one of her assistants.  The others will help you function too.  Look towards the Weyrbred ones for example.  Not good ones, mind.""  His grin is short.  ""No boys or wine and you can't pee with telling someone where you are.  In other words, pretty much the same.""

""It.. sounds like it, yes,"" Liadan murmurs, watching B'ane for a moment. ""I'll find Mika and see what else I need."" She looks around, shell-shocked demeanor sinking in a little more. ""Thank you,"" she finally offers towards the bronzerider. ""We'll, ah, have to see about touching up your wardrobe a little once I'm settled in.""

B'ane nods his head, eyes still on the Southern Boll find.  ""You know almost as well as I do I can use all the help I can. Good luck.  If you have any questions you can find me to ask them.""  He then retreats out of the room and into the darkened hall labyrinths."

The Klah Pot (#13444J)
The Klah Pot's atmosphere can range from quiet and soothing to loud and rowdy depending on the time of day you walk in, but it's near always reminiscent of the tropical environment that the Weyr is steeped in. Large plush chairs in shades of green from pale to verdant have been situated in semi-circles around finished wooden tables in every corner of the mid sized cavern. The center of the room has two larger tables with accompanying seats which are usually used for games of dice or poker respectively. And for the especially tired or weary there are a few couches clustered together behind the large table. 
Radiating out from the bar at the back of room, which now serves every known drink from klah to whiskey, the colors of a near complete sunset have been painted on the walls in shades of dark blue and purple that melt into a rich wine before fading into the ground. A stained wood replica of the Ista Weyr badge is displayed behind the bar as well, lest anyone forget where they are.
You see Dragon Dart Board here.
Obvious exits:
Lower Caverns

Wyn walks in.

At odds with his left hand, the more unnatural of the two he's got, B'ane's hammering darts into the board that was made for it.  His record isn't as successful this way, using the hand he utilizes least, but evidently that's what practice is for.  There's a drink partially empty - or full depending on outlook - but it looks forgotten.  At least for this point in time.  The Klah Pot is calm for the moment, no heavy drinkers on the war path just yet.

The thought of a drink is the only reason that pulls Wyn into the Pot at this point in time. Crowds and people, something that is normally manageable has turned out to be an increase issue for the woman with a glowing gold. Attire to match the mood, she does drift in and aim straight for the bar where a drink will already be at attention for the woman. Then it's a quick cast about to see who's-who and here before B'ane gets an overly acute inspection. 

B'ane's riding jacket, a relic from his old life and still marked with his old Wing's emblem, hangs crooked on a chair.  It's a telling trait of a day without Threadfall, otherwise the bronzerider would never be seen in public without it donned.  Wyn's admission into the room isn't noticed so much as it's felt, all the nuances thirty-five Turns of dragonriding elicits.  He finishes tossing the set of darts, then half turns his torso towards the bar and the limited audience around it.  The outfit is eyecatching, and it does, but his gaze is made not to linger more than a second.  B'ane thinks to say something in detail, head lifting, but all he finalizes is, ""good drink?""

""Very, but likely will be needing a partner."" His own partial one is spied, ""Yours?"" The words, interpretted as an invite pull Wyn over towards the bronzerider, while the acute gaze never fails to hold him or those things that might be associated very closely. ""Do you normally play alone,"" noticing the darts recently left as she comes to pause right by that very jacket. 

B'ane looks over to his drink which travels during a casual blink.  ""Only water but Lem tells me it was flown in from the Snowy Wastes in the south.  Tastes like regular water to me.""  But just in case he missed something the glass is raised and held to the light.  ""I don't always play alone but when a bluerider heard I was going with my left hand he conveniently declined.""  A soft laugh shows B'ane can't fault him.  A second glance bobs down the Weyrwoman's figure when she isn't looking directly at him.

One brow raises up slowly while those pale eyes drift from the man to his jacket where one single finger dares to tread a faint path along that emblem. ""Good enough to intimidate, that's quite the skill you have."" The glance from him is missed, but that doesn't mean the Weyrwoman won't be looking up and posturing much the same way that her lifemate is outside and on her ledge for any who dare to look. She'll share a rare smile, one that even warms her eyes to that liquid glow. ""Maybe you just need a different type of challenger?""

""Intimidate?"" B'ane throws a brown-eyed stare up to the goldrider and grins unabated for a short time.  ""I think he was more in fear of his life.""  The glass of water is back on the small rotund table even though B'ane is watching how Wyn's treating his flight jacket.  ""You like darts?""  As a result the darts are pried out of the wood and off the floor.  The cluster's piled on the table where she can manifest how much she likes them.

Tactile fascination has her maintaining contact with that jacket, there is something about it that keeps her in contact for several moments more. ""I like a challenge,"" Wyn replies as manner of acceptance for those darts. ""Though I make no promises as to how I do."" She could be using a poker face, but then maybe not. ""You normally a betting or bragging rights type of man?"" One dart fingered then selected, while Wyn's gaze wanders over the man's frame in open appreciation. 

B'ane scrubs at the stubble on his scalp with a hand soon to be employed for more darts.  ""I tend to bet more than I brag.  More lucrative that way I guess.  A mark each?""  The cover cost is suggested, a modest amount as to not give much away in terms of his own profficiency.  ""At your ready, I'll be over here.""  'Here' is close enough to be in competition without being close enough to be upwind or downwind of the female rider's scent.

Here. Normally Wyn would be far more considerate of personal space and tactful placement, but conditons being what they are... ""A small wager to start, but as you wish,"" she'll drift past rubbing her arm to his should that be allowed to happen. If not, expect another eye-to-eye glance before she'll claim a position and toss.

Wyn takes aim then flicks her dart at the board.
Wyn's dart flies towards the board.
Wyn's dart lands exactly on the brown ring.

You carefully take aim at the board, then throw.
B'ane frowns slightly as his dart scores a blue. 

B'ane doesn't leap from his skin at the touch but he does ensure a small step backward.  He admits as Wyn's first shot claims the brown ring, ""it isn't often I play darts with women.""  B'ane reaches for his water and sips thoughtfully while his opponent runs through her first shot.  His turn is next and, still lefthanded, marks the blue circle.

Wyn looks well pleased as her dart scores a bronze!

You carefully take aim at the board, then throw.
A flight falls from B'ane's dart causing it to veer suddently...straight down into the floor, several feet short of the board.

Now Wyn is not a regular at the game of darts. In fact the number of times she's played the game since coming to Ista has probably totalled less than the number of digits on one hand. So when she bests her company, two thought processes run through her mind, ""You were either being far too kind and allowing me to win."" Which earns a scolding glance. ""Or you prefer sacrificing your marks to the greater good?""

Creamed, not haphazardly beaten.  B'ane isn't often known to be a sore loser so he willingly nods and inserts a few fingers into his mark pouch.  His mark presented to the Weyrwoman is Healer stamped in a slightly different crest.  Let's see a vendor accept /that/ present time.  ""No you beat me fairly. I did my best, I'm just not that good with this hand."" Yet.  ""There's something else too,"" brown eyes earnest.  ""Aboleoth, when it comes time for it, won't be among the pack chasing Isyth."" 

Open palm accepts the coin without even looking and where it gets stashed... gets a little creative. ""Oh?"" Not used to hearing that, Wyn finds herself head-tilting and staring intently at B'ane because of it. ""Why would that be?"" If there is any offense to the statement, which there is not, nothing shows save open curiousity towards a man that is as perplexing as the current Threadfall pattern. 

""Oh! Wait.  That one may not be any good,"" B'ane voyages anew into the mark pouch, filtering through it until a recent mark is drawn out, this one Smith.  Offering it to Wyn, ""the other one was from, uh, my time.  Keep it anyway, might be even more valuable some day."" Soft-voiced B'ane throws his shadow behind the chair propping his jacket.  He dare not look at the spot the second mark too, will probably be harbored.  He does meet her eyes though, holds them steady, and confesses, ""I want no chance to be Weyrleader."" 

The offer for the second mark is waved off. ""I have the mark I won fair and square. Thank-you though."" The admission is an open catch to the remaining guard of her nature, pulling it to expose open surprise and confusion. ""Is it because of us?"" Searching for a reason, she'll await the answer - undeterred by B'ane's own regards. 

B'ane looks at a space beyond where he hopes to find clarity without a consequence of derision.  ""Us?  I mean, you and Isyth?  You- no, that isn't the reason. "" A few fingers spread out opposite the grains of the table and the rider looks at them.  ""I gave it up.""  He admits with few details.  B'ane is a man who lets a few words stand for broader meanings.  ""Aboleoth would give chase but I thought it would be right to let you know it.   It's no insult, Weyrwoman, may Isyth have a fit and far flight and you a Weyrleader your equal.""

A single nod means she's registered that explanation and acceptance finds it's place in her mind. ""That I can appreciate - though is it a fair thing to admit some disappointment?"" One hand rises up to defend against what might be mistaken as selfish reasons. ""We have several riders amongst us that would make a good Weyrleader, but having choices and the /right/ ones is what is best for this Weyr. Your experience....."" She sighs, a thoughtful action in its delivery that causes leather encased torso to rise and fall. ""Do you two plan to leave the area entirely when she rises, or remain?""

B'ane has in the span of Wyn's reaction drunk the last of the water.  He keeps the glass comfortably in his hand, then hands.  ""My experience is limited, there are better fits.  Especially someone not liable to be his own grandsire.""  A disturbing but lightly-put jest to which he smiles but can't laugh.  The empty glass is neatly placed upon the table so that B'ane might put on his flight jacket.  ""We'll be back when she's caught,"" he acknowledges soundly.  In current presence he doesn't say if he also has disappointments.

Wyn studies that glass with a wide range of thoughts roaming through her mind, but one or two of the more amusing ones amuse enough to provoke another smile. ""I somehow suspect that, if I were tied in to your family in future, you'd already know this."" And since no mention has been made... ""I could be wrong, but.."" She acknowledges the rest graciously enough, finally indulging in the drink that had been forgotten the moment their game had been played. ""I have a thought perhaps... Walk with me?""

At the dart board B'ane's rounding up the ten spent darts and making sure the board is marginally straight for the next man.  His response is well, nothing at first, looking at the Weyrwoman curiously but cautiously at the same time.  B'ane would like to believe he's no fool.  ""Sure.""  Walking is an undemanding feat.

""I have my good and bad moments during this time."" It's Wyn's way of apology. Proddy though she may be, there is still some common sense left to her personality now and again. She takes her time in glancing about, eyeing up the exit just as she's abandoning what remains of her drink to the nearby table. ""It was more of a favour - but since you two will be absent, advice will do."" She pauses, considering before jumping right in, ""I have kin... bronzeriders both and though both would do well as Weyrleaders, I .... am wary of the flight results.""  Steps are taken and she'll even nod as she goes, averting the crisp gaze to the ground below. 

""I've been exposed to hundreds of proddy green and goldriders,"" which certainly dates him. ""I mean, enough that you've no behavior to apologize for."" Except maybe that outfit intended to make men suffer.  B'ane has every intention on not having to follow Wyn and face further exhibition.  Thus he's on her left and slightly behind as befits rank.  ""I see.""  And he does.  ""Stand ins aren't possible?""

Make them suffer or at least pine a little... ""That was what I was wondering about. The approprieteness of."" Hesitation in step matches that of words and she'll cast a glance over her shoulder, ""Isyth's last flight was chaos enough and a stand-in was there, /but/ was it right? Do the weyrfolk really care or is it just enough to be good leaders?"" It's his experience that Wyn relies on, perhaps even trusts now. 

They pursue the various corridors without hurry though receive due space when faced with someone from the opposite direction.  B'ane reins in his typically large strides to practice one more condusive to conversation.  Dark eyes flit right.  ""The Weyrfolk will be happy and Weyr strong if they have leaders who work good together.  You don't have to be bedmates for that.  Sleep with whom you will.""  The Tillek in his weak accent dilutes when he talks in a low register.

That is enough to ease the remaining worries from the Weyrwoman's mind and another blustery sigh is released, just this time in appreciation. ""It's too bad you will be away then,"" is mentioned with that wickedness that glints in her eyes in brief glimpse before facing forward. The bowls' entrance nears and with it comes the gentle kiss of autumn's air that has her tipping her head to greet it. ""Thank-you for that B'ane. I've had so many opinions layed on me in recent times, it's become a blur of right and wrong. Selfish or not.""

B'ane's expressive eyes make up for the usual stoic presentation of his face.  They lift to the younger rider then glide to look at such things as cracking mortar or the color of a distant drudge's shirt.  He nods shallowly then tries to uplift a straight-lined mouth.  ""We all do what we can, Weyrwoman. Glad I could help you.""  And he sounds sincere.  They separate, one going one way and the other making sure to be opposite."

Trader's Area
This area has the potential of being either sparsely furnished or comfortably cramped. The ultimate fate depends on a myriad of things that come down to supply and demand at any given moment.
What won't be found here are foodstuffs unless dried and stocked high enough to be kept safe from people and critters alike. But what can be found varies as the whims of any individual. On one shelf, a nautical tool from Tilek where it resides beside a colorful set of scarves from northern Ista. It's this intentional mismatch of goods that adds a bit of flavor to the area. Along with the furnishings. 
A couple of chairs are scattered in the area for sitting or purchasable pieces, colorful rugs hang on the wall or find themselves rolled tightly together. Those that adore the floor are of more neutral, masculine colors. The most notable would be a hardwood table that doubles as a desk. Usually, there's a small map that is held by four jars filled with sand of diverse colors that can be found in Ista and other beaches. Beside that, a ready quill and clean pieces of parchment. 
Lastly, along one wall in the back finds itself draped by a light cloth that reaches from floor to near ceiling. It serves to keep the door leading to the trader's personal room properly unassuming unless pulled aside to reveal its presence. 
Niles is here.
Obvious exits:
Common Room       Quarters

B'ane deliberately tries lightening his footsteps from their usual direct stomp and the metallic resonance of the hobnails under his boots.  Short-sleeved, the unbelted tunic was once a flamboyant scarlet.  Now it's a washed out mediocre pink.  He comes after entering juggling a few buckles within a palm and is completely new to this part of the Weyr.  Oh and the rider gawks readily.  

To those who venture this far into the Weyr, there's a glimmer of what can be found throughout other regions of Pern. Not the typical crafter goods, but those with personality. Colorful scarves from the warmer and cooler regions to the more hardy stuff. Small skins of brewed ales or wines. The sound of buckles dancing around in someone's palm isn't enough to catch the attention of the trader residing inside. It does cause the cocked wedged shaped head of a bronze firelizard to regard the entrance with interest. The brown of the pair, settled against Niles' shoulder as the young man emerges from behind the desk with a piece of hide in one hand and a glass in the other. Neither of terrible interest as he sees the reaction of the bronzerider in the doorway as he amusedly quips, ""Passing through?""

B'ane has in his hands a miniature distance viewer he's holding up to a light source and peering through.  It bores straight towards an incoming Niles until it lowers readily and B'ane places it back on the shelf as gingerly as possible.  ""There's more to this place than I thought,"" staring at the north wall, ""is that a flag from a Nerat fleet? I recognize the trade colors but the pattern is nothing I know.""  Drawing a hand up to his chin it barely touches before B'ane again rattles what's in his hand.  ""What sort of buckles do you carry for dragon straps?""

""Those, I can get in ample supply, Bronzerider. It's just a matter of silver, bronze or gold for the more flamboyant,"" Niles replies, the humor holding steady as he backs against the desk with the hide being set aside and the glass continued to be held with only the tips of his right hand. ""Some also like bells, but I don't think that might be your style. Unless..."" With a tip of his head, he suggests, ""That is not true. As for the flag? The pattern is true, but each ship or family may have their own style, as it were."" Beat. ""You're familiar with the area?""

B'ane feels like he could remain in this section for quite some time but won't permit himself the luxury.  ""Gold?""  The word bears repeating paired with a odd facial expression.  Voice falling back to its accustomed baritone, ""no no nothing fancy like that. Plain iron will do, without bells.""  A pink shirt is as saucy as he'll allow himself to be.  ""I know a lot of the Nerat coastline, I once mapped the southern tip and knew some of the people there.  The name's B'ane,"" his hand comes over the desk and pledges a very hard shake.

""Niles."" Replied as a tanned hand extends between the space separating the two men, the glass is shifted to settle onto the desk beside the hidework. ""Well met, B'ane. Tell me how many you need, and I'll be sure to get them on the next trip out which should be in a couple of days."" Explained with an air of professionalism, the trader's grip is firm before releasing the grasp with a secondary dip of his chin in acknowledgement. ""I'm sure that every spare hand is needed to dig the Weyr out of its recent submerge from the rain.""

Color gets B'ane to center his vision on a bounty of scarves but it stares at a racing prototype runnerbeast saddle, maybe Keroon in origin.  ""Uh, two - no, make it four.  A little surplus never hurts.""  When his attention comes back to the young trader he shows a small grin.  ""That it is, I have no wish to share my home with fish of any kind. That'll be it then Niles, thanks for your time and there's no rush.""  Nodding once prominently the bronzerider works his way out after a few more liberal glances to the room."

Northeastern Bowl
High above the heads of earthbound visitors, the great northern cliff wall towers ancient and indifferent beneath its tiny burden: the Ista Star Stones, just barely visible up above on the curving rim. Midway along the bowl wall, a gaping tunnel yawns wide to the upper entrance of the hatching grounds; broad enough for several dragons to swoop in at once, its dark mouth shimmers with the rising vapors of the Sands' heat, even without the presence of a gold clutch. At the very base of the cliff, a huge tunnel extends for the benefit of landbound spectators to the Hatchings, while to the sides of the entrance are several stone-chiseled steps leading up to various wide ledges for the leaders and queens as well as the Records Room. Just below them is a newer construction, a stone barracks that houses most of the Weyr's guards with a practice ground around it including various target dummies and a fenced off ring.
Various stairways lead up to nearby 'ledges'.

Though it isn't raining now the Istan skies are clotted with gray clouds that have an all too familiar ominous outlook.  B'ane, knowing an advantage when he sees it, is using the reprieve to oil Aboleoth.  The bronze, hatched in the future, is average in size and aquiline shaped: large chest, shorter limbs, limited tail length, hooked muzzle.  His eye ridges are especially prominent giving the bronze a shewd expression at the very least and ill-tempered at most. 

A shadow moves with an uncommon velocity across the Weyrleaders' ledge, and on down the stairs, angling for the southern end of the bowl when it comes to a stop, solidifying into Q'luin. ""B'ane, Aboleoth, enjoying the -"" the lean man squints up at the clouds, ""sunshine?"" Sarcasm is thick. 

B'ane is vigorously rubbing the inside of his dragon's undersides where the left foreleg attaches to the torso.  The rag is dirty and telling of Aboleoth's general disdain for bathing.  The rider snorts air out his nostrils showing his level of pleasure quite accurately.  ""Already doubled my tan.""  He knows it's Q'luin when he looks and remarks, ""though you're a shade or three ahead. Southern?""  Mistaking the Igenite's origins.

Q'luin presses out a crooked grin on scarred lips, ""Sometimes I wish - no, Igen."" Stepping around to lodge his locale in B'ane's line of sight so the rider can continue to tend to his mate through conversation, the dragonhealer asks, ""How are you enjoying the past?"" 

Experiencing a loss in feeling in his hand from a prolonged raise, B'ane levels it out and uses the time to switch out the oiling rag for one in better condition.  ""I didn't think the accent fit any Southerner I knew.""  Out of Aboleoth's shadow he comes but the distinction between shade and not isn't impressive when there's no direct light source.  ""Well enough I suppose,"" though still feeling like a goat among horses.  ""Tell me, what's the state of your Weyrsecond?""

Q'luin catches the question and tosses it back and forth in his mind two or three times before lobbing it back to B'ane. ""State of?"" There's far too many ways such a question could be taken, and some of them could possibly bring the conversation in directions the other bronzerider hadn't meant to go. The whites of the dragonhealer's eyes are grayed by the lack of light, nearly blending with the double black inner circles, making the dusky rider look near demonic as his face dips into self-imposed shadows. 

B'ane rolls the shoulder from the arm that did most of the oiling.  ""She got a bite from a tunnel snake the other night, you know, one of the common ones in any Weyr.""  No where does he indicate he was a firsthand witness.  Aboleoth, takes Q'luin within a laconic glance, then articulates his bottom jaw slightly to the right then forward as if stretching the tendons pre-hunt.  ""I didn't expect a very dire outcome.""

Q'luin's throat thrums with thought until lips part to impart, ""I've been on the road a lot lately - I hadn't heard."" Worry lines create crags across a bronzed brow as his head lifts to the faint light, hands rubbing absently along onyx top and trousers as this information rolls around. ""There were a lot the other day. I took as many of my kids as was allowed to the Hold until this - menace passes."" That would encompass snake and surges of storms. 

B'ane nods knowingly as only an introvert can.  ""Couldn't have ended too badly if you hadn't heard then.  This is what, the third, almost fourth sevenday of little to no sun? Ridiculous.""  A spot on Aboleoth's hock is buffed until three-fifths of the bronze sheens.  ""How many Turns have you been a rider?""  He poses squarely to the younger bronzerider.

Oddly thrown off by the question, Q'luin drops into silence to count, blinking in unison with each number silently tallied. ""10 turns."" The sum is plunked down, decisive nod following in agreement with answer. ""You?"" The older bronzerider is scanned, searching for telling signs of age that are blended together to form a judgment. The Igenite ticks out a grin as a mute bet is made with himself. 

B'ane's bottom jaw is also given to swinging one way.  ""I was going for no more than twelve but was thinking more like eight.""  Seems like he also engaged in a private wager.  ""Aboleoth is thirty-five. Hatched from the ugliest egg.""  Fruit Gone Rancid to be precise.  Looking up towards his dragon B'ane's dark eyes are warm.  ""Good thing the contents were better."" 

Q'luin chews on the number given, cocking his head to peer up at the well aged dragon as filtered light splashes down to spotlight the black trails of ink on his visage. ""Dragons are endless."" Humans are not, and so the dragonhealer's gaze drops to the bronze's rider, trying to calculate how many moons are left for the man. ""I'd like to pick your brains sometime - I want to hear about the future,"" and the long life thus far lived. ""Do you like fine whiskey?"" The bribe is laid out. 

Aboleoth tosses his head higher than his shoulders and takes steps the steps to exist on a different side of B'ane.  Still hardly shadows to work through.  ""I like the smell of it,"" the bronzerider affirms with the sense of a grin.  ""But I don't drink.""  He turns to slap Aboleoth's hide: the unspoken signal that concludes the oiling segment.  ""Clear skies if you can find 'em.""

Q'luin's lips twist with one part disappointment and one part deliberation, but a nod is rolled out for B'ane's benefit. ""Then maybe over a game of dice."" The younger bronzerider isn't quite sure what to do with the idea of a man that doesn't drink. Sure he's come upon them before, but B'ane doesn't come off as a tea tottler type. Already shifting into a speedy stride, the dragonhealer blithely informs, ""They can be found in Igen!"" and then he's off collecting shadows to once again dwell with the anonymous."

Lower Caverns
A long, snake-like twist of glow-lit corridors leads around the living quarters of the Weyr, deep in the tunnel-ridden depths of the extinct volcano. Down one smooth hallway are the rooms of crafters assigned to Ista Weyr, while down another, wider and brighter one are the doors leading to the rooms of weyrstaff. At the very end of a small niche, an old and battered panel leads to the Candidate's barracks, while the moisture-heavy air and soft sounds of splashing water in another niche lead to the communal weyr baths.  Eventually, if one walks far enough, other parts of the weyr might be reached by these circumspect means.  A bit disorienting for visitors, yet Ista's residents could find their way even if all the glowbaskets suddenly went dark.
Obvious exits:
Living Cavern
Type 'doors' for a list of rooms.

Stirring in the lower caverns is B'ane, a hot meal in his belly and cold wet clothing on his back.  He passes an individual of Weyrfolk distinction silently, swerving the outside shoulder back to compensate for space he knows the woman doesn't need anyway.  There's a section of this corridor that has failing glows which breeds confidence in a migrating tunnel snake population.  Seeing a shape in the dark barely two feet away he clouts a fist against the wall to shuffle the contents of the glow basket.  B'ane gathers a knife in the other hand. Under his breath, ""get back here."" 

In the darkness and the damp, glowing, flickering eyes watch wary and warningly. The sound of slither and hide rubbing against stone signals onrush of violence and fury. Blood splatters, shrieks are heard, a creature emerges from the shadows triumphant. Enki's got himself some dinner. 

That migrating tunnelsnake population has caused way more problems then would have ever been previously imagined. Even with the Weyr's children delivered safely to the Hold, there are many weyrfolk that have abandoned their normal duties to hide out in brightly lit areas that also happen to be dry and elevated and /far/ from the infestations that are making their way through the lower caverns. One of them, in fact, is the Weyrsecond. Being unable to tolerate even the sight of the little bastard snakes, she's very carefully been  striding around with a -huge- basket of glows to make her way to her office. The sounds of a firelizard kill and a hunter of 'snakes has her pausing just outside her office door; basket set down so she can pick her way through to where B'ane is stalking something. ""How bad is it?"" she hisses, whispering for no apparent reason.

B'ane, at a developed crouch, hasn't been able to acquire a visual on the vermin that is until Tia as Bearer of Light illuminates the corridor.  ""Hold,"" directing Tia to be still.  A green-black specimen keeping to the opposite wall has the bronzerider springing forward and a boot catching up with the snake's head.  It crushes instantly the part that counts.  ""Depends on if you clean the floors I suppose.""  Sounds of Enki's kill reach his ears and B'ane stares in the distance where those sounds bred.

Enki hops into the light, unafraid with a bit of trailing striped tail hanging out of his mouth. Swallowing with a gullet almost fully extended, the tail vanishes and the bronze flies off to go lurk in the upper nooks, ever vigilent and waiting for the next slithering sound of dessert.

Normally Tia might bristle at being told what to do. But these are tunnelsnakes we're talking about. In this case, her steps immediately cease and she swallows past a sudden knot of fear in her throat. ""How many are there?"" She really should help out, rather then just stare, prompting the woman to pull her knife from its sheath around her boot. The sight and sound of enki slurping back his dessert has her making a green-tinted face of disgust. But, fortunately she's able to hold back the urge to gag. ""Let's get on with it then."" Impatient little thing, isn't she? 

With a spare effort B'ane kicks the foot-long carcass to the wall where Enki and his kin can profit from it.  ""Pardon Weyrsecond, but where did you get the impression I wish to spend the remainder of my evening hunting tunnel snakes?""  On his feet B'ane now sheathes the utility knife at his belt.

Tia makes a rude sound at the back of her throat when B'ane speaks. ""Pardon Wingrider, but where did you get the impression that I was making it an option?"" she wonders, her ire immediately lit by the way this one always talks to her. Which is why she copies his way of talking all the way down to its diction. See how he likes it! Still holding her knife in hand, she directs a glare at the bronzerider, and then kicks at her door to open it. ""If you don't want help, though, it suits me just fine."" Hmph. Taking out her annoyance on the glowbasket next, she kicks that inside the room and shoves the lid off it with her foot. An act that exposes a whole slew of the little slimy green monsters waisting for her in her working space. It's her sudden shriek that really sets them off though. A few dart right for her feet, and a couple more decide just to try and flee. 

Enki is drawn by the bad human sounds, his wings flickering in the light of the glows as he darts past the screaming weyrsecond and starts pouncing at the fleeing 'snakes. The offending biter is lashed at first with tooth and claw, all but gutted before he starts chasing the rest, flicking about the office till there's no more sign of the dangerous pests.

B'ane closes his eyes for the opportunity to gain a degree more composure.  He is resigned to follow orders.  As Tia instigates the process of reclaiming her office, ""have you harnessed the worth of firelizards for this sort of task? Look how that bronze takes to it like a fish,"" stomp, ""to water.""  He kills one while more scatter.  ""I'm not equipped for this, a club would at least come in handy Weyrsecond...""  B'ane takes aim at another but his heel misses.

Composure? Who needs composure? ""Maybe you should have thought of that before mouthing off. I have enough to deal with right now."" Tia snaps, aiming a foot at one of the offending creatures and sending it flying across her office to splat against the wall messily. ""Just get out of my face. I don't want to see you, or hear you, until you learn to at least talk to me like I'm a fellow rider instead of just a.. a.."" What was she saying again? Enki got one of the little biters perfectly, another she kicked clear across the room; even B'ane's able to keep a couple of them from attacking. But ooooooonnnnne little miscreant manages to sneak by them all and the greenrider is staring at it in horror as its fangs latch onto her ankle and she shrieks -again-. Her puny little knife is thrown straight down to try and dislodge the creature. But honestly, when one has venom injected into them and long teeth embedded into their flesh... it's hard to aim properly. 

""Just saying I would be more effective it I had the right means.""  B'ane articulates plainly.  He is an apostle of Weyr hierarchy but his standing as a pastlife Weyrleader and senior rider make blindly obeying young Tia a demanding task.  A snake with vague rings is pinned via foot and dispatched with the knife.  The greenrider's alarm makes Aboleoth's rider jerk his head in her direction and start towards her upon seeing her dire straits.  ""I'll get it."" Calmly affirmed, B'ane measures the distance to the snake above Tia's leg and grabs it just behind the head.

Tia has the inane urge to snarl at B'ane; but all that comes out is a rather wussy little growl that fades into an equally pathetic whimper. And for all of her bravado, the greenrider's eyes roll back in her head and she faints dead away even before B'ane's gotten ahold of that snake at her leg. Boy is she ever going to be pissed when she wakes up and remembers all of this. Never fear that all is silent though though; for even though her own talking or yelling has ceased, Kyraceth picks up where her lifemate left off, trumpeting a rather loud, brash, and alarmed 'shout' of surprise. 

B'ane didn't expect that outcome from Tia, not at all.  Given the options of extracting the snake or letting his Weyrsecond crumple to the floor in a mass of dead weight, B'ane does the first, hoarsely hissing, ""shard it all.""  Because he's got the animal by the area he would cut to kill B'ane messily improvises to avoid getting bitten himself.  Then he's attentive to Tia, knee caps smarting on the rock floor. ""Weyrsecond? Weyrsecond!""

Good thing Tia was out like a light for that tunnelsnake 'extraction'; things would have been a lot louder and messier if she'd been watching it. As it is, coming back to reality is not exactly a fun adventure. ""Shard it, I'mma be sooooooo sick."" she mumbles, doing her level best to push herself away from the ground and away from the bronzerider that manages to irritate her effortlessly. At least she probably won't dissapoint any expectations when she uses the wall as a brace to launch herself from towards the infirmary. Assuming she can do so without falling flat on her face. Stubborn is her middle name. Well, one of her middle names. 

<i>I sense that Kyraceth is likely proud of her riders stubborn ways in most cases, but in this instance Kyraceth is in panic mode; a vacuum of air being sucked out around her that forces her to poke her thoughts against Aboleoth's mindspace. << Just have your rider dump her in the infirmary. She'll never ask for the help and she needs it. >> Nevermind that the greens tone is a fiery brand of annoyance in and of itself.</i>

<i>I sense that Aboleoth's acknowledgment seeps by sand grains as dry as the Namib desert. Caught in the act of drinking away deep thirst the bronze is ample in metallic sounds and organic shifts in stressed syllables. << He will take her. >> The bronze confirms as the dry brittleness of his words rehydrate and flex.</i>

B'ane cleans each side of the knife once methodically by wiping it on a soggy stretch of his leather breeches.  It again falls by his hip.  He picks up the remains of the tunnel snake and takes necessary steps towards Tia.  After an equally necessary sigh he stoops to a favorable position and lifts her from the ground horizontally, ""I know you'll hate this.""  A foot lashes out to kick a snake out of the way but it was a failed attempt at the start and he knew it. 

Tia puts up a token flail as she's carted off towards the infirmary by the bronzerider. She's never going to forgive herself for most of her actions tonight. But at least she can let peaceful oblivion overtake her once the attending healers have seen to her. It's much better then facing up to her behavior /or/ B'ane as far as she's concerned. 

<i>I sense that Kyraceth seals off the leaking air from her bubble of atmosphere, the sound of the vacuum of space slowly shrinking to the hiss of a small leak. << Thank you. >> The words are delivered qith a quick and simple clip of metal on metal clanging together like a closing door before she withdraws.</i>

B'ane, having arrived in the Weyr's intertior from the outside, is abundantly damp and smells of sour animal hide.  They will indeed find a healer, B'ane will offer a decapitated tunnel snake for venom identification, and he will leave the Weyrsecond in good care as quickly as propriety will allow.  He will also not resume the skirmish featured in the Weyrsecond's office."

Various stairways lead up to nearby 'ledges'.
  It is fall.
You see Aboleoth here.
Wyn is here.
Obvious exits:
East Bowl       Hatching Grounds       Leaders' Ledge       Guard Barracks

The evening's drizzle persists enough to drive most in a hurried fashion from one place to another leaving the Weyrwoman of Ista to be one of the few exceptions. With Isyth curled away and fussing over one pile of eggs or another, it had been time for the woman to slip off and grab food and fresh air and perhaps a little 'freedom'. All that accomplished, Wyn is now slowly making her way back to those heated grounds now littered with seventy eggs.

The rain hasn't turned B'ane away either while he skirts the area where indoors and outdoors have an uneasy truce. Now and then with a flush of wind he gets more of the drizzle but this is mild weather. It doesn't appear he's been here long, tracks still strong in the softened ground. Like many people he's getting his fill of gauging eggs.

The movement alone isn't enough to flag her attention, but something about the man has her pausing and letting those frigid eyes roam over him in open inspection. In fact, she'll even stop, unbothered by the rain to openly stare and eventually nod. 

Wyn is either quiet or B'ane's guard is relaxed. A minute almost extends until enough concurrent sounds have the bronzerider facing and delivering, ""Evening, Weyrwoman."" His head inclines a few degrees but eyes remain on the young woman. ""I'm just openly spying on the eggs."" A grin isn't very fruitful, but it softens his face for a moment. ""Call it a weakness I guess."" He looks again.

""You know you can go in and see them from the galleries? Let's you see the broad spectrum of both Isyth and Liltyh's eggs."" She won't be so quick to return a smile or grin, but that doesn't mean one isn't pulling at the edges of her mouth. ""I think there's a few of us who could suffer from that same weakness... B'ane is it?"" Yes, she has heard of the wayward rider, Q'luin and others having filled her in long since that fateful arrival. ""You've found a place and settled in well enough?""

Though he is not far from being in Wyn's path B'ane's feet give no immediate ground. ""Forgive this, but the galleries are less personal to me."" One hand goes buried in a pocket the other dangles close to his hip in an unsymmetrical design. ""B'ane, yes, and we've a new weyr up from the forest. The trees and I are such good neighbors they shower the ledge with pollen quite often."" He canvasses Wyn, mostly restricted to her head, trying to learn her face. ""I see the goldriders of this time haven't lost much of their looks."" He states. Flattery, if it could be called that, is indirect. B'ane might as well be talking about 3rd Interval architecture.

Education about Wyn rarely, if ever comes from the expressions or emotions kept well in check, so for the moment B'ane is entertained with only the mute yet intense glance from a woman seeking to gain a little ground in return. ""Execellent, I must admit to a little envy considering the view you have."" The compliment is enough to garner a softer gaze, albeit unrelenting still. ""Thank-you."" Pausing long enough to let him know the compliment was well received, she doesn't bother with making a move to carry on. ""So tell me something of yourself? A hobby perhaps? What did you do before..."" Arriving here. 

B'ane convinces the hand in his pocket to rub away a drop of water on its way to his jaw. It tickles enough to cause the hand to rub longer than neccesary. The cue is well taken. ""I was a Threadfighter until it was no longer required so when faced with the Weyr's creation of units I took to learning the art of surveying land and making maps. It is gratifying and a reward in itself, but does not compare to Thread."" Even if seeming sullen a fire lurks in his eyes. ""Tillek bred.""

A nod of approval is given to to last note while arms wrap about herself as if to fend off the rain. ""When you say no longer required...."" Due respect is given there with a little tact thrown in for good measure, just incase the question encroaches onto sensitive areas. ""Interesting skills those, and ones that I daresay could come in handy."" To the point she's got an idea or two already brewing within those frozen depths. ""No family to speak of or for?""

While in the area B'ane forms a note to remedy the days' worth of growth on his face. ""...when the Pass came to a natural end and riders had to find new sources of purpose."" It's taken him a while but the man takes enough steps to ensure him a place inside the hatching cavern entrance. ""Is Isyth in need of meat? Aboleoth can oblige her."" Somewhere on a stretch of rock the bronze is out there accummulating rain drops on his hide. Voice low but precise, ""A brother and two sons.""

Trailing behind, she won't be tall enough to peer over his shoulder, so instead lands her gaze somewhere at his midback. ""So it must be unsettling to find yourself at a point where we've just started our Pass."" Head cocks slightly, Wyn pausing to check with the dragon in question but before an answer is given she's already nodding. ""Wouldn't hurt, if he doesn't mind? She was horribly thin all through carrying those eggs. He'll have to leave the carcass at the sands' edge though, she's not very tolerant of visitors dragon or otherwise near her eggs."" Which will make egg touchings very very interesting in a short amount of time. Wyn sighs slightly at that though, any attempts to distract to date have fallen way short. The family is noted and filed away for future references in case the need should arise. 

""Actually, I can't really say it was a relief, but there's something about a Pass... Men have it right when they curse it and say life will be the better for it. But Aboleoth, he's true to his breeding. His reason for existence was cancelled and I was either sensitive to that where I felt the same or I had more than a little of the same sentiments in me."" Now and again looks come for the goldrider. ""The man in me was grateful for its end but the spirit in me was not."" And lo, his crux. Whether to try and find his way back Between and allow things to be as they were and should be or to indulge in whatever fight two souls have left. ""He hunts now. Should he fell two or three beasts? More?"" Keen, B'ane reads into the woman's plight. ""She may calm if the clutch sire is there for comfort and reassurance during touchings. Does she have a good rapport with him?""  

""Three, if Isyth doesn't eat one, I am sure Lilyth will be grateful."" Listening to B'ane's words, Wyn's own features take on a mild frown before fading away behind that cool composure. ""Well, for what it is worth, for as long as you two wish to remain, you have a home at Istan."" And in that and the following she is openly sincere, ""Experienced riders such as yourself and Aboleoth are invaluable and I think we stand to learn much from the pair of you."" Those looks of his will be met straight on, no wavering or hesitation exists in this young woman, a couple more steps bringing her that much closer. ""Unfortunately Isyth isn't easily soothed or calmed,"" as Wyn has come to discover. ""In most things she is rational, but with her eggs..."" One shoulder bob later indicates that the weyrwoman and her mate might be at a slight impass. 

Learn much. Tia said the same thing a different way. ""Thank you Weyrwoman, I've seen nothing but generosity."" Any indifference or rare hostility towards the time-traveler are unrecognized in Wyn's company. ""Females are seldom rational with any of their young,"" B'ane remarks wisely. ""Perhaps a more senior gold would have some luck with her if she's breeding for the first time."" Tajiath comes to his mind though he knows not the older queen's name. As a water-drenched Aboleoth conveys the first of his kills to the cavern entrance, it prompts his rider. ""I will distract you from your duties no longer Weyrwoman."" Failing at a proper good-bye B'ane commits a respectful gesture and turns into the rain."

Infirmary
This natural, bubble-shaped cave shows signs of recent renovations, the walls freshly painted, with new fittings. Cupboards cover one wall of the large cave, one marked prominently with a black skull and crossbones and bolted with a heavy lock. A stone bench, covered in a padded sheet, rests in the center of the room directly under a glass glowbasket; this area is the examining table. Racks, draped carefully with sterile cloths, surround the bench. Another bench against the back wall contains a sink, a water heater, and research equipment, including a white cloth draped over what must be a microscope. Three beds line the wall opposite the cupboards, curtains on tracks prepared to be drawn around them. The room smells faintly of redwort and numbweed.
On top of the cupboards are two firelizards.
You see Candidate Physical Board, Jamie, and N'ano here.
You notice Roane asleep here.
Lzi and Rhaeyn are here.
Obvious exits:
GroundWeyrs     Caverns     Crafters'Area     Rooms

Hey, a girl after her own heart. Lzi smiles widely as she reshuffles the deck, shrugging her shoulders as she deals cards to both herself and to her visitor. ""That's what I heard in the stores from the guys raiding. Now we just to figure out /why/. That's apparently a little bit more tricky."" With the appropriate amount of cards given to both, a straight faced Lzi checks to see what she's got, moving the cards around in her hand. ""I'll tell you what, though. If I get anywhere near the guy who stabbed me, you better believe he won't be walking away to tell the story to anyone else.""

Rhaeyn gathers her cards up, shifting some here and there, frowning with a pensive, unconcious pout. ""Well shards, why don't any of them just go down to blow-me-Windy and ask his old grey ass?"" A smirk lurks, and Rhae kicks back in her seat, a brow still furrowed as she contemplates her cards. ""I'd help you. Just let me know if you ever find him. I'm pretty good at field-dressing wild wherries.. I imagine skinning a man live wouldn't be that much different.""

B'ane's heavy sandals again visit the Infirmary's floor after visiting a Maverick dragon housed for a sprain. He questions the resident medic when the blue's last feeding was and after receiving a satisfactory answer, makes a mark for Lzi. And her guest. Dark eyes bob to each rider. ""Lzi, weyrwoman,"" grouping friend before rank in his deference.

Lzi just laughs at Rhaeyn's suggestion. ""Well, I don't think any riders or residents from here are exactly welcome down there. Just like no one from the hold is exactly welcome here at the moment."" For obvious reasons. Just look at her leg. Or actually, don't. It's gross. Lzi then becomes focused on her cards until amused eyes flick up to Rhaeyn, pondering. ""Skinning. Huh. I never thought about that. I really just thought about cutting his dick off and letting him slowly bleed to death."" Because Lzi's nice like that. And then there's B'ane visiting her once again. ""Just can't stay away from me, can you B'ane?"" she coyly replies up at the bronzerider, batting her lashes at him.

Rhaeyn contemplates, finally selecting two cards and sliding them face-down onto the table. ""Hit me for two,"" she comments, glancing up at the arrival of the bronzerider. ""Bronzerider, sir,"" she states, with a respectful bob of her head. ""High Reaches' greetings to you and yours."" Then back to the most important conversation: the hypothetical death of Lzi's attacker. ""Well, cutting his dick off, of course. But he could potentially live from that, if the Healers got to him quick enough. Obviously you Istans don't have enough imagination."" She winks at Lzi, and continues to lounge in her chair. ""And you mean to tell me that noboy here hasn't thought of sending a rider incognito down there? Easy enough to grab a runner and trot over to Grinstead and then up to the Hold, I'd think... act the Farmer and ask around.""

""Now there's talk I want to be a part of..."" The Istan with Tillek notes in his baritone says with staged apprehension. Males parts are just as sensitive in conversation as they are in reality. The foot stool he employed before is absent this visit. B'ane is privately thankful. ""How's the leg? Been dancing much lately?"" His humor is almost always delivered with a straight face.

Lzi's a good girl and does as is told, dealing two more cards out for Rhaeyn. For herself, she takes three, her face still solid, conveying nothing. ""Oh, but I have a healer twisted around my little finger, who is also wanting for the man's death, so I think we could easily arrange for all healers to be busy whenever that would happen,"" Lzi innocently tells the woman, shrugging her shoulders. ""Oh B'ane, calm down. We're not talking about cutting your dick off."" But then the greenrider just has waggle her eyebrows over at Rhaeyn suggestively. As in, she's /seen/ what the bronzerider's working with, and she definitely would not want to cut it off. ""I think they're trying to deal with this whole situation as, uh, as appropriately and official as possible,"" she comments to Rhaeyn before groaning at B'ane's question. ""Are you kidding me? They won't even let me stand up to take a piss."" Lzi's in rare form tonight with her attitude and cussing. It's all this being cooped up that's doing it to her. Turning her rude and cude.


Rhaeyn catches Lzi's eyebrow waggle and shifts her gaze over to the Tillek-accented Istan with a much more languid, appraising glance than before. Why hello. Didn't see you there. ""Mmm. That would be a pity, I suppose,"" she agrees to Lzi, her own Fort-accented words highlighted by clipped vowels. ""A loss to all women everywhere."" Her gaze shifts over to Lzi, almost as an afterthought; ""Unless he's into guys?"" A scrunched-up 'eh' expression to that, before Rhae's examining her cards again. ""Mm. Appropriately and officially. Covered in red tape, then."" Her eyes roll. ""How long have you been in here, anyhow?"" she asks the greenrider.

In a standing stance B'ane's legs make a narrow V. ""A whole lot of people need to be thrashed if you ask me."" Holders and Weyr riders alike. B'ane is more than liberal in that sentiment. A deadpan look to Lzi flies over Rhaeyn's head when his preference for bedmates is so casually researched. Answering for the invalid, ""by her rate of time three Turns, eight months, and too many days."" And since it's facing him, might as well scrutinize Rhaeyn's card hand.

Since they've both had time to examine their cards, Lzi flops out three cards in front of them, allowing them even more time to look at those dealt and the ones they are holding. Still, the greenrider's face shows nothing. Until she rolls her eyes at Rhaeyn, smirking. ""Oh no. He's into women. Trust me. I'm the mother of two of his sons."" So, Lzi has B'ane experience, and she's very proud of that fact. The bronzerider just doesn't share his bed with anyone. Or at least he didn't used to. B'ane receives a look before Lzi answers Rhaeyn's question. ""A sevenday. Maybe a sevenday and a half. I really have lost track. Every single day is so sickeningly the same and boring. Which is why I've resorted to challenging old men to games of dragonpoker. Might as well make some marks while I'm stuck in here."" And then when she realizes that B'ane has a perfect view of her visitor's cards, eyebrows waggle at him, suggesting he should tell her what she's holding.

Rhaeyn coughs. ""Oh. Aye. And would you /stop that/?"" Rhaeyn shifts her cards down, glaring with a rather ferocious expression over her shoulder at B'ane. ""I'll be more than happy to give a great example of a person thrashed if you try to cheat me on cards."" Severe hazel gaze doesn't lessen a bit, before she blandly turns back to Lzi. ""Mother of two sons, eh? You're a mother? Don't look it."" That previously assessing look given to B'ane is now focused on Liz. Yeah, Rhae's very obviously equal opportunity. ""Bleh. A sevenday? I'd go nuts. How's your lifemate handling it?""

B'ane catches his arms about his torso, thumbs hooked so that he's better deducing what cards Rhaeyn's got to work with. ""You need not be so suspicious nor mistrusting. I win enough times with Lzi to be able to refuse an opportunity of retribution. Besides,"" he straightens both back and shoulders stolidly, ""it's not worth safeguarding /that/ much."" Touche. Speaking of their offspring, ""Kane's building you something but don't tell him I said that."" 

""I'm a mother of..."" Quick. Count. Math. Gah. ""Five. Six, really, but the last one is just a foster."" So he doesn't count. And Lzi is rather flattered at Rhaeyn's compliment, obvious in the fact that she's practically glowing now. ""Can I keep you?"" she questions Rhaeyn, obviously becoming more and more enthralled with her as they spend more time together. ""Oh, be quiet, B'ane. I've beat your ass at this a few times,"" she tells the bronzerider, shaking her head at him. ""And don't worry. I won't tell him."" That his father spoiled the surprise for Lzi. ""Izlasth? Oh, she was a bitch before, she's a bitch now. Such an old woman. She's concerned for me, obviously, but she has people looking out for her. I just wish she'd get proddy, because damn. You try being laid up for a sevenday without getting laid.' Both Rhaeyn and B'ane get looks after that comment, trying to convey her utter desperation.

Rhaeyn slants a narrow-eyed gaze over her shoulder to the bronzerider, and then contemplates the river cards with idle concentration. ""Six? No way."" Her reply is automatic, and her gaze floats back up to Lzi, real surprise showing. ""Faranth, I hope that I look half as good when I eventually have a kid. If I have any children."" See that face? That's the youthful I-never-want-to-be-tied-down-to-a-child face. Rhae's good at it. ""Aaaah. She sounds like my own dragon. I don't think anyone's ever talked about Rys as anything but a bitch,"" Rhae reflects aloud, before barking a quick laugh. ""I just gave up all sex, myself. I'm... going through withdrawls already.""

""Yes, but I believe I earned those marks back."" The bronzerider affirms with a brusque parry and careful smirk. ""But I've no mind to keep you women long."" Despite wanting to witness the elaboration of this conversation, the Maverick rider is confident in Lzi's overall health and in Rhaeyn's talent as a good distraction. Three's a crowd when it's not a boudoir accomplishment. ""Ma'am,"" nodding to the visitor and deepening a duplicate for Lzi. His long strides back for an easy exit."

10/21/08

Southeastern Bowl
 This area of the bowl is the highest point of the bowl floor; from here, it slopes down and to the northwest, spilling out to the plateau below the wide gap in the Weyr rim to the west. Various tunnels here lead into the Weyr's inner caverns; the living caverns, hatching grounds, and main Weyr tunnel all branch off from here. To the west lie the stables where the Weyr's runners are housed. There is also a stone stairway that leads up to the Weyrleader's weyrs.
  It is an autumn midmorning.  
Perched on rocky crags about the bowl are two firelizards.
Green Safuriketh is here.
Obvious exits:
Ground Weyrs     Hatching Cavern     Central Bowl     Stables     Weyr Tunnel     Living Caverns

Talicanitath holds her golden head high as she parades in from the Central Bowl.
A perfectly proportioned forleg, belonging to Talicanitath, is inclided upwards, allowing Lendai to dismount with some measure of dignity.

Jhakkarath rumbles and makes his way bravely, excitedly in from the Central Bowl.

Pippa is led in by Jeyth.

Ayla hops down from Jhakkarath's neck and lands with a sweeping flourish, smiling. Applause please! Applause!

A group of multi-colored firelizards blooms overhead in a sky already sharp with sun. The tunnel bore into the Weyr's structure emits a wagon drawn by thick-legged shire-type runnerbeasts. The driver's knot is the aqua and purple of SeaCliffs Hold - and he is but one of several. ""Aihuh!"" Commands are given to the team of two who rattle in substantial harnesses. B'ane's firelizards melt into the accumulation of them and he, drawn out by noise, comes froms the Infirmary. 

Lendai is on recording duty today, and she doesn't look too thrilled about it. Tapping her writing utensil against her clipboard, she frowns. Talicanitath is off to the side, watching the commotion with mild interest. ""This had better be good."" The rider grumbles, giving s stiff yawn as she moves forward, eyes narrowing at the driver. ""Let's make this quick, people! Some of us have much better things to do."" Like get a facial! Whooo! Looking down at the hides already on the board, Lendai nibbles on her lower lip. ""How should I even write this all down..."" Eh well, it's good to just roll with the punches.

Ayla seems to be on one of her morning walks through the weyr with Jhakkarath. With the twins tucked at home with their father, she feels free to roam around a bit longer than usual. She notes the unusual amount of activity in the bowl and waves to the people around her.

There is joy and appreciation in a day that had dawned as bright and autumnally tropical as this day. So it is no wonder at all that instead of commingling with the other denizens of the Weyr who are breaking their fast, a dark-uniformed weyrling is without, propped against dragon with creampuff in one hand and a mug of fresh klah merrily steaming on the hard ground, but away inches from a disaster of being tipped over by the self-same girl's idly tapping foot. Pippa drags a finger through the cream of the roll, garnering a healthy dollop upon the tip. It is well on its way to her mouth when the noise of harnesses and heavy things sounds.

B'ane pushes upon nose a pair of modified goggles, slimmer, tinted for the benefit of damaged eyes. Sure strides, martial driven, bring him at end to Pippa's standpoint. ""Would you mind having Jeyth relocate all the other dragons from this section?"" Delivering a test for the weyrling pair of their confidence and its influence in achievement. It's also a show of goodwill for the Hold's animals. ""Though,"" sensibly, kindly, ""her included."" Lendai recording, dimmed by a mead-colored perspective, strikes approval from the ex-Weyrleader et al.

Ayla swoops gracefully up Jhakkarath's gleaming neck and settles between two sharp looking neckridges, giving Jhakkarath's neck an aprriciative scritch. This happens to set Jhakkarath to thrumming.

Jhakkarath takes off.

Pippa is still mid-swipe of her roll when B'ane approaches. The teen blinks at him for a moment, obviously caught a tad off guard with her little morning sweet-time siesta. A blink later though as she is pushing herself off of Jeyth with a free hand pressed to shiny hide. ""Yes, sir,"" she replies. Wait. Blink. Cream-dolluped finger waggles a bit, that precious white sweetness threatning to fall off her finger as she mindspeaks Jeyth (who had already heard B'ane's order, but you know appearances and all). ""Use fardling lazy asses, that'll make them move."" To which Jeyth looks rather skeptical with that curl of her neck and the peer at Pippa. Sure, dragons can look skeptical. ""Okay, say it /nicely/."" 

If only people knew the obscene things Lendai was now writing as she scritches away at the hides. Even before people start unloading things, go figure. ""So this is from Seacliffs, then? Hmm."" She ruffles through a few of the papers, an eyebrow arching up. ""Thaaaat's interesting."" And a little discerning. The goldrider frowns yet again, her teeth now taking up with nibbling her bottom lip in contemplation. Taking a few steps back, Lendai evens herself with B'ane and Pippa. A flash of a smile goes to the Weyrling, while the bronzerider only gets a curt nod. ""Did someone call on the drudges and whatnot to help unload? I don't really see any..."" Up on her tip toes, the 'rider looks about before spotting some helpers. Ah. Good. Less for her to do then.

""Pretty little helpers!"" The driver of the premiere wagon, already on his feet, issues B'ane. The hat-wearing fellow peels back canvases to expose preserved goods. ""Aye, every man should be so lucky,"" the bronzerider replies hospitably. The second and third wagons have made it, the last crossing through the morning-lit passage. ""Seacliffs,"" affirming. ""Did Ista Hold's tithe already arrive?"" Glancing to those records of Lendai's. Hide the profanity! ""Uhh, please?"" He thinks Pippa's words aloud apply to him.

Lendai can only roll her eyes and mutter a ""In your dreams,"" before her eyes are cast down upon her hides and a rather troubled look covers her features. ""Well..."" She shifts through the hides a second and third time, eyes scanning and re-scanning, only to shake her head. ""No."" Lendai says, finally looking up. ""They aren't in any of my notes, and Lanti gave me these from her own. And if anyone would know for sure, it'd be Lanti."" She even offers them over, minus her today hide. Ahem. ""Maybe they're just... extremely late?"" Even that sounds lame coming from her. ""I can send a fire lizard over, asking what the shards is up, if that's appropriate? How does one ask a Hold where their tithe is?"" Lendai never learned that one in Goldriding 101.

Pippa drops her chin back down, sun-brightened hair falling to her shoulders with the movement and tickling about her long neck. Her attention draws to the others, and an amused and toothy smile flashes at the nicety addition. The teen finally pops her finger into her mouth to enjoy that bit of cream, rather looking more like the weyrling she is than any sort of impressive figure. ""Crackdust, you just go on over there 'n say something like. 'So, how's it shaping up over here? My weyrlings are fit to cause a mutiny if they don't start seeing some fresh tubers on their plate that don't look like an old uncle's dangly bits. True story."" 

Corsair returns to his caretaker eventually, the eldest of B'ane's trio. The man isn't fitted with better trappings to incorporate firelizard claws, the bronze easily breaching B'ane's thin linen tunic. ""I thought most areas of the island were rebounding quite nicely from last Turn's rains..."" The chronicles are taken from Lendai, skimmed, and given back. ""Huh. What do I know, I'm just a rider."" The plainly reserved rider adapts to a dimple-punctuated grin for Pippa's lively (and graphic) quip. ""That's D'baji's and Minka's job. So long as they know about it we're off the hook."" Despite about a dozen Weyrfolk assembled, B'ane divides a look to each goldrider invitingly. ""Shall we?""

It takes all of Lendai's self control not to choke at Pippa's words. It really does! But she does crack a small smile while looking questioning at B'ane. ""The Istan Lord Holder already hates us for our shaky treatment of Nicholarin when he was a candidate. Something tells me approaching him like that would be bad."" Look! Her diplomacy lessons are paying off! ""I've heard word from my... sources that Ista is due to have a gathering soon because of their good season."" The bronzerider is given a droll look. ""Waiting of D'baji and Minka to react is like waiting for the sea to freeze over."" Lendai grumbles. ""We'll run out of food, starve, and waste away before anything like that happens."" With her hides back in hand, she reshuffles and puts them back in order. ""Alright, call off what we got and how much of it we got. I'll be checking these, thoroughly, to make sure no one else is trying to stiff us our right.""

""Aye? Well, so be it. Something will get figured out, always does. Holders."" Pippa says that last as if it is some kind of curse word worse than half the stuff she already says. A blink at those about the wagons, ""Present company excluded."" Cough. She continues, ""Ain't no worse than toting firesacks all fardling day. Got more dust in my drawers than-"" Let the ears of all be lucky because Jeyth has the presence of mind to nudge Pippa with a shoulder shrug. Not so much chastised by her lifemate as amused, he continues, ""Betcha I can carry more than you, B'ane.... sir."" The last of her creampuff is ate, cheeks chipmonking for a moment while sticky fingers brush at her breeches.

""You'll like them, make the best pies I had in a decade."" Driver One makes sure to point out ripe starfruit ensured fresh only by picking it early. In all thanks he misses Pippa's close call of contempt speaking to an assistant. ""There's three baskets a'them, six fine fish nets, one case of glows, and the rest fish. Eh, how many Brak, twelve? Oh! Thirteen. Put thirteen."" All but manipulating Lendai's hand for her. ""No one's gonna /starve,/"" this baritone is B'ane's while he removes baskets to give to the lower caverns folk. Height and strength have their use. Corsair distributes himself to the wagon's seat in B'ane's stead as the latter seems eager. Smirking, ""here's one for ye,"" rounded with salted fish.

Lendai just writes away, after of course, she finds herself a nice seat and gets all comfy while the other riders actually do the hard work. Maybe being a recorder isn't so bad after all. ""Make sure you double check, B'ane! I don't feel like getting yelled at for incorrect numbers."" She could get up and check for herself, but darn it, she just got settled. At any rate, here Lendai sits, doing her part of the ""work"".

Pippa strides over, making excellent use of her long legs as the young woman jumps up to stand upon the back tailgate of another of the wagons. She flashes another bright smile at one of the drovers there, not shy at all as she reaches for a heavy cask as well, ""What kind of fish ya got there? Salted redfin sounds fine as anything right now."" Says the girl who just ingested a creampuff with grand aplomb. Fingers curl about the rim of the cask, rolling it to the edge upon its bottom rim, where a pair of waiting handlers are there to aid as well. Meanwhile, Jeyth's own curiosity as the sight of articles and foodstuffs being transferred about has the gold creeping closer, her long shadow eclipsing a path of morning sunlight as her head leans forward to watch.

B'ane hoists the last of wagon one's baskets over the side indifferently as if it were much lighter. Two drudges flank and grip one handle each to transport it inside. Lendai goes assessed behind his glassy eyewear. ""Don't worry, they'll have it all lined up for you in the stores."" Whether or not that's true, let the goldrider believe it. Accessing, now, Pippa's wagon, ""I don't know about her."" Implicating Lendai while the solitary case of glows are gingerly dragged forward. ""Easy lads,"" someone sings to the hitched runnerbeasts who, with no blinders, glimpse Jeyth's advance.

Pippa takes to the manual labor with an ease and lack of complaints. Leaning in and joking with another one of the drovers at a muted tone (even if the laughter isn't), the young woman aids in helping to roll off another of the great casks filled with prepared fish. All the while, Jeyth swings a tad closer, head turning as she watches the procession towards from the wagons towards the caverns with obvious interest. Her wings draw away from her sides, mantling with her obvious curiosity, tail switching in the dirt of the bowl. Despite a contented belly, no interest at all for the beasts of burden, their fright or wariness ignored.

""Best watch her,"" from behind those glasses observant B'ane notes Jeyth's gain. ""These Hold beasts can be pretty sensitive."" One of the Weyrfolk with freckled arms contributes: ""And they're still attached!"" If the runners go the wagons go. It doesn't take a whole lot of time for the tithe's contents to be shifted, absorbed into the Weyr's greater infrastructure. To Pippa, ""you handle yourself well."" Aboleoth's rider removes his firelizard from the wagon by displaying a tanned forearm. ""The Weyr's grateful for your harvests."" He broadens out to clasp the head wagonmaster's arm and they meet with fraternity.

Pippa turns her head from her joking partner, dark hair falling away from her face as her attention draws first towards B'ane at the voice, and then on towards the onwardly-creeping Jeyth. The young woman gestures at her lifemate with a hand holding what looks to be a melon. ""Hey, I ain't gone on a hayride in a long time. Can you /imagine/ the mess if these beasts go runnin' and all of this fish, and this fine melon here were to be splattered about. It'd stink like the floor of the Mug."" Jeyth halts in mid-motion, and then falls back to sit upon her haunches to look like the prim and proper gold that she is -or something. Melon in hand waggles once more, the girl's eyes go dull with mindspeak, and then she bursts out laughing at whatever passes. Pippa's smile grows again, and bow is sketched B'ane-wards (yep, still with the melon). ""My thanks, sir."" But yes, back to unpacking.

Their freight largely received the wagons won't be long in leaving. B'ane, confident in the able bodies and in their progress, steals away to likely inform one of the Weyrleaders or Raine of the transaction. ""You're in charge, Pippa."" Over the rest of the operation, the men, and lounging Lendai."

10/12/08

Corral
  This part of the plateau has been fenced-off to provide an enclosed pasture and grazing area for the Weyr's herds.  Grass covers the fields, rippling like waves in the wind.  Herds of herdbeasts wander about, grazing lazily.  To the north is the exit to the plateau, and from here you can also see the forests and beaches below the plateau to the west, as well as the ocean, stretching off to the horizon.
  It is an autumn evening.  
Green Misumith, bronze Aboleoth, and green Izlasth are here.
You see Wineskin here.
Lzi is here.
Obvious exits:
Plateau

Age and motherhood hasn't stopped Lzi's vanity. Just like she used to do in her twenties, while Izlasth is off feeding and socializing, the greenrider is laying down on a blanket, clad in a bikini, working on her tan. And possibly catching up on her sleep. Any time away from the kids is time that Lzi spends working on herself, and today it just so happens that her body gets the benefit of Izlasth's hunger.

Aboleoth has been here. B'ane, however, has not. The bronze has been a glutton: killing five beasts, eating three and plucking at the remains of the rest. He's put weight back on, pre-Snow Wastes amount, though Aboleoth has neither the luxury nor joy of being obese. Muzzle raised to address Izlasth, the dragon still safeguards his dashed prey with a shield of living wing membrane. B'ane comes from the beach area, working his way up the plateau's steep incline.

Izlasth returns Aboleoth's greeting, deciding to turn her attention to him now. But before the green can focus on him, she relays to Lzi the fact that the bronze is there and that B'ane is approaching. Slowly, eyes are opened, squinting as she props herself up, looking around to find the bronzerider. Eventually, he's spotted, and a wide smile crosses Lzi's face. ""Hey stranger,"" she calls out to him, attempting to draw his attention to her. And her sexy body. Compliments are welcome for both rider and dragon.

The herds display their mania: the whites of their eyes are clearly visible, they bellow mournfully, and are constantly on the move, their numbers trying new configurations. Izlasth takes the place of another green who only just left and they are about as far from her as they can get, even using Aboleoth's body as diversion. B'ane's life-mate is sluggish after feeding so much and so quickly. He tolerates their ruckus. ""I was wondering whose dragon was tearing 'em up now,"" B'ane finally crests the hill, only a little winded. As he comes closer to Lzi, ""and who are you supposed to be tearing up?""

Luckily for the sanity of the herd, Izlasth, at least for now, is finished feeding, now happily enjoying conversation after her meal.  If dragons could drink brandy and smoke, she'd surely be doing it right now. Lzi replies to B'ane with a smirk, eyes glancing down her body, if only to assure herself that she is looking good. ""No one until you came along. You're my first victim."" Lucky for the bronzerider, or perhaps he thinks it unlucky? Though, he is luckier than most since he has seen what's under the bikini. Ahem. 

B'ane flicks the fabric at his torso for an instant, if futile, brush of new air. ""I bet you still tell that to all the bronzeriders,"" in the spirit of a jest. Still his eyes show less smile than once they did. ""She's so quick."" He marks the efficiency of Izlasth's hunt compared against his own dragon's equanimity as he crouches on the towel's edge. 

Lzi smiles at B'ane little remark before eyes go toward her own dragon, shrugging in response. ""I know. She seems to get faster with age, instead of slower. It's so not fair. Though, she's so like an old auntie, because she's more interested in catching up on gossip than she is really eating. If there's good gossip to be had, she'll eat less and then we'll have to come back the next day when there's no one here to really eat."" Hopefully B'ane caught all of that since Lzi's rambling. ""So. What have you been up to? It's been awhile since you've graced me with your presence. Or do you just hate me?"" There's humor behind the remark, but Lzi's eyes seem to reveal that she's worried that that could possibly be the truth. One never knows with B'ane.

Izlasth will likely find more discourse with the bovines, or fence rail for that matter. He is a dragon of great things to say when there is a great need for it. Large teeth scissor off a section of herdbeast to be chewed with thought. ""Poor timing for her,"" the rider mentions with a grin, clearly knowing his dragon's brevity. ""Just hate you? Lzi, I know you too well for that."" Compliment, catch! 

""Funny, but knowing me well seems to be a common reason /to/ hate me,"" Lzi retorts, but there is a grin soon to follow her words, relief that he doesn't, in fact, hate her. ""So, are you going to tell me why you've been missing in action lately, or is it a secret?"" she asks, patting a spot beside her on the blanket soon after her words, an open invitation if B'ane so chooses to join her.

B'ane's rump drops down to the towel with not much care about sitting on it or the bare ground. A knee that's drawn up becomes something natural his arm soon covers. It's a part-time philosopher's posture. ""I didn't tell you this, but I've actually been in Tillek seeing- trying to make amends with what's left of my family."" Lzi knows Brenon intimately herself.

Brown eyes widen at the news, Lzi's mouth dropping open along with it. ""Really?"" finally comes out of her mouth once she's recovered herself. There's certainly an embarrassed flush at the memory of what happened with Brenon, but hopefully B'ane doesn't notice. ""What brought about your change of heart?""

One of his boots is used to pick and dislodge dried mud from the sole of the other. ""Just, neither of us were getting any younger and I thought Interval'd be the perfect time to bury old hatchets, stitch old wounds, try for regrowth. Brenon seemed just as receptive I think and that surprised me. Our mother was lukewarm which is probably her personal best. Kalin,"" naming the eldest brother, ""he's just overall hard to read.""

Lzi bobs her head along with the news, her eyes in turn trying to read B'ane. ""Well, that's great. I'm very proud of you,"" she tells him with a grin, giving him a few pats on the back. However, the same family forgiveness cannot be said for the greenrider. ""Are you going to be taking the boys to meet them anytime soon, or is it too soon for that?""

""I was thinking that - I wanted to ask you. Brenon's got quite the clutch, three girls and one son with another on the way. Even met his wife for the first time, she seems a good match. I'm happy for him. Kalin's got a couple bigger ones must be around Linnau's age though I think a little older. Shells it seemed so strange to be there though. It felt completely foreign as if I'd never lived there for fifteen Turns.""

""You can take them there if you want, B'ane. They're yours too, you know,"" Lzi replies, nudging him with an elbow and a smirk. ""Plus, it'd probably do them good to meet some family."" Since they surely don't have any contact with Lzi's side. ""Wow. Brenon with four kids and another on the way? I don't remember if he even had a girlfriend when he came to visit you. But then again, that was, what?, seven, eight turns ago if not more? Wow."" Saddened eyes then to go B'ane. ""You and I were't even together then. Hard to believe it was that long ago.""

B'ane is satisfied in the amount of mud less conspicuous on his boots. ""Yeah, it's been a while."" The details of his younger brother's visit long laid to rest. ""I'd be glad for the company. Brenon's wife, you'd like her I think. Erisma? Errisa? Something like that. So,"" he doesn't quite make it to asking Lzi about her own relatives. Sated, Aboleoth clears the pen, stepping carefully over the fence. He'll go and sun now, what's left to immense himself in.

""So,"" Lzi echoes, the conversation falling into a little slum for a moment. ""You can take the boys for the sevenday tomorrow if you want. They'd probably love to spend the time with you. Lannin's been whining about seeing you, actually. You'd help me out by getting them out of my hair for a little bit,"" she says, once again nudging B'ane with an elbow, a flirtatious smile on her face. She's totally trying to work him over, but perhaps he's far too smart to fall for her moves anymore.

B'ane gives his jaw a once-over with a hand, scrubbing at something not there. ""The sevenday?"" The rigors of keeping two small boys for many days at once certainly springs to mind. ""Sure, I can,"" apparently reaching the conclusion he can handle said rigors. ""I have the Weyrsmith to confer with about the preservation of agenothree."" Grinning, following the motives behind the nudge.

""Excellent,"" Lzi says, grinning from ear to ear. ""If I can handle them, you can do it. I have faith in you,"" she tells him, patting him on the shoulder. ""They're not too hard. They're good boys. Too much like their father, if you ask me."" And then there's another nudge and smirk. Maybe it's just being in a bikini that makes the old, twenty turn old Lzi come out in full force.

B'ane recalls his leg tigher to his person, foot scathing the ground in a vague furrow that tonight's wind will erase. A hand he braces just off his hip as the man leans forward to print a short kiss on the corner of Lzi's mouth. Then comes the transition to leave, to honor the appointment. ""They're young yet,"" on his feet, ""give them time.""

That kiss definitely solidified the twenty turn old in Lzi, eyes lighting up and wide grin spread across her face as she practically stares in wonder at B'ane. ""I love them just the way they are. Now I have two little B'ane's that I can boss around and do my bidding instead of one big B'ane,"" she tells him, grin widening. ""But I still love my big B'ane too."" Just so his feelings aren't hurt. ""I'll drop the boys off in the afternoon tomorrow. Try to bring them back in one piece.""

B'ane laughs on an exhale, the sound camouflaged. ""I'll try to bring /myself/ back whole."" The animals within the corral have taken on some semblance of ease although they stick still to huddles and tight group distribution. He'll leave with the image of Lzi's lounging.
Lzi watches B'ane's retreating figure, a silly smile still present on her face. Dark, brooding eyes remain on his figure until he's completely out of sight, and only then does the greenrider lay back down on her blanket, returning to her napping and tanning."

7/19/08

Southeastern Bowl
 This area of the bowl is the highest point of the bowl floor; from here, it slopes down and to the northwest, spilling out to the plateau below the wide gap in the Weyr rim to the west. Various tunnels here lead into the Weyr's inner caverns; the living caverns, hatching grounds, and main Weyr tunnel all branch off from here. To the west lie the stables where the Weyr's runners are housed. There is also a stone stairway that leads up to the Weyrleader's weyrs.
  It is an autumn afternoon.  
Perched on rocky crags about the bowl are two firelizards.
Green Safuriketh, green Aukaith, green Qimath, and gold Dedanseth are here.
Lanti and D'baji are here.
Obvious exits:
Ground Weyrs     Hatching Cavern     Central Bowl     Stables     Weyr Tunnel     Living Caverns

Twisting the middle toggle on a caprinehide vest closed, B'ane takes the last step connecting indoors from out with a high stroke of the leading leg. Someone calls his name and his torso twists to catch what needs to be said. ""Beholden to Nerat? Fine, thank you. No, no felines that I know."" The person in shadow retreats and B'ane seems to as well.

In the high heat and sunlight of the early afternoon, Dedanseth glows a deep, glittering gold so different from her pale norm.  Her riding straps are already long gone, and her slender body twists this way and that as she makes a slow circle around the bowl, staring down everything in her path.  Lanti, who had just come out to check on her 'mate, just stands there, looking a little lost, and quite blank, obviously in deep conversation with her dragon.  Despite the heat of the day, Lanti shivers a couple times and folds her arms tightly around herself.

Malarky blinks in from ::between::!

Jesha wrangles like the sexy little brownrider she is in from the Central Bowl.

B'ane keeps to what accepted shade there is, following the natural incline of a volcanic point superimposed onto ground. ""You can't be /cold/,"" at least twenty paces left of Lanti the man supposes with a mild expression. Weyr parapets are eyed for their compliment of dragons and there is a steady normal assortment. Aboleoth himself cannot be seen if only at this distance.

Jesha fairly tumbles in, hair askew looking more than slightly harried and upset.  ""What the fu..."" *clang crash*  Oh my what a -clumsy- drudge. ""... Sevareth.  HONESTLY.""  Composure is gained inasmuch as possible when someone is almost thrown from her aged dragon and salutes/halfbows are given where due.  ""Hi.  Hello.  No disrespect intended.  My dragon is a daft wherry.  He practically dropped me off his leg when I was dismounting and skittered off!  I pulled my freaking calf muscle.""  Explanation given (wow that was a lot of information and exposition!), she limps towards the general direction of a rock.

Sevareth walks in from the Central Bowl.

Malarketh is a dragon fresh out of weyrlinghood. And his rider fairly wafts with the new leather scent as he is unceremoniously dumped from his brown. Yes, brown. Don't let that firelizardesque blue hue fool you. Brown. As before-mentioned rider picks himself up off of the ground, a thorough dusting upon his sleeves reveals the hue of a knot from Telgar Weyr. ""Nice,"" he murmurs to his dragon.

""Shut up,"" Lanti snaps to B'ane, her one-time mentor, not bothering to look at the man.  ""Tellin' me what I can and can't be when Des is all..."" she cuts off as Dedanseth gives a fierce, trumpeting call, her intent not at all subtle as she fans her wings and rises on her back haunches.  With a coordinated leap and downward stroke, the slender dragon takes the skies and glides west toward the corral, taking very little time in choosing a small herdbeast to blood.  Lanti takes a deep breath and turns her head slightly, then stares a little.  ""/Jesha/?  You all right?""  And again, the woman shivers slightly, though she's also begun rolling up her sleeves.

Gracchuth arises from a cloud of dust further down in the bowl - not as simple a task in a generally humid climate like Ista as it is back home in Igen - and watches Dedanseth carefully. Surely a majority of bronzes are already blooding at the corral. This big brown, however, remains uncertain, even after Dedanseth has taken off. And his rider is, as of yet, nowhere in sight.

""You alright, there?"" Just about a replica of Lanti's concern for the brownrider of High Reaches. A strong walk loses most of its original inertia until B'ane's at a semi-still stand. Churlishness he is familiar with, though not from a vessel such as Lanti. But dragons, especially breeding ones, come often with free excuses. Lips part slightly with another panning of the volcano, this time its regions closer to the ground.

Malarketh looks most pleased with himself. And so it is with a tail-flick that the brown settles right on down upon his haunches, looking a tad canines for all of that head-tilting he is doing while peering about the bowl. Our young, tumbled, and adam-appled hero, dear I'lit clambers to his feet, shaking his dirty blonde-haired head from side to side, ""Just a slip. Just a slip.""

Sevareth decides to grace us all with his presence, managing a sheepish glance towards his lifemate before making towards the deliiiicious meats. His efforts at apology do not go unrewarded and Jesha gives the ol' single-finger salute to his retreating behind. ""Urft. I'm... fine? Ish? Dorkwad the magnificent is probably over-excited 'cause -- and sorry for not warning ahead of time, D'baji -- I decided to come say hi to Bajiren while I was takin' a fly 'round the old digs. Thanks though, y'all. Old bones don't handle surprises so well and ohhhhh."" Understanding dawns dimly in her eyes. ""Aw, c'mon, you didn't have to drop me! She's not in the /air/ yet. Aaargh. No disrespect meant, Lanti, but he got wayyy too excited about getting his elderly lovin' on.""

The Weyrleader - on his way from the hatching caverns to the living cavern, pauses briefly to peer at the 'Reachian brownrider. ""Huh? Oh. S'fine. Uh... yeah."" Lanti gets a quick glance, and an, ""About time, eh? Good luck."" And then he disappears. His bronze will be noticeably absent for the flight, true to his weird monogamous-dragon form. And D'baji disappears in the pursuit of lunch.

True to habit, Dedanseth seems to be holding herself to just the one beast, draining it with a good deal more mess than usual.  There is a strain there, however, a desire to take more.  In the bowl, Lanti is already struggling against that pull, fighting to be strong for her 'mate.  Which is just as well, as this way Jesha only receives a vague sort of ""Huh?  Oh.  It's fine,"" before Lanti scrubs at her face quickly and blinks around her before really seeing those present.  Then she looks again.  Catching on to D'baji's presence just before he disappears again, she starts to salute, then aborts the gesture.  ""Time for more comfortable quarters, I think,"" she mumbles to those nearest.  Comfortable for others, most likely.  Lanti begins a slow walk toward the ground weyrs, stumbling now and then as her concentration is dragged dragon-wards.

B'ane recognizes this for what it is, lists the options mentally, and infers that there is no option that will leave him out of Dedanseth's rising. Aboleoth, wings a deep dihedral in the distance, coasts for the feeding pens already dressed in grey dust. ""Think it too late to jump back on your dragon?"" B'ane quips lightly to I'lit, glimpsing but not yet following Lanti.

Malarketh perks. Oh, how he perks. From the very tip of his spaded tail to the tremble along his sagging wings, right to the twitch of his nostrils does the brown look most interested in the blooding that is occurring over yonder. Would you look at that. With something like a bounding and springing hop. I'lit swings about and bobbles (nearly falling to the side with the turn). ""Telgar's regards... Its a cold rain up there."" Should be all the explanation needed for a trip to Ista.

""Shardit... hey, B'ane, doll, can I borrow your shoulder?""  Another withering glance is leveled at Sevareth, who is very happily doing his best impression of a sprinkler.  A hungry sprinkler.  Homf homf slurp drink.  ""I dunno if I can make the reverse walk of shame with my leg going 'ow ow I am a leg why did you do this.'""

It's just as the goldrider starts somewhat-stumbling off toward those 'comfortable quarters that Gracchuth takes to the air, winging over to the corral and, in no time, landing his dusty self on the first available herdbeast. The blooding is a rush. Equally in a rush is Gai'us, the lanky, sandy-haired ex-Igenite arriving at a jog from the caverns, spotting Lanti easily enough, and hurrying to join her and the group. Required or not comes the greeting to her of, ""Here."" And a last little bit of veg, pinched between thumb and forefinger, is tossed to the side - followed by a distracted, ""Sorry,"" when it lands rather near Jesha. And her leg.

Aboleoth lands with toes spread to a maximum diameter. A string of domestic animals range too close in their escape from Dedanseth and B'ane's bronze simply swings his head in a solid blow to one of these animals. Pulling back the skin around his teeth he tenderizes it with three bites from the shoulder down. The herdbeast rolls from the left side of the jaw to the right to extract the most of its contribution. ""Take your pick,"" B'ane assumes himself by Jesha with a small boyish smile in order to help her. 

Dedanseth gives her chosen bloodfeast a last, lingering lick and eyes the scattered beasts with red-eyed interest. Her head shakes from side to side, however, as if trying to avoid a nagging biteme. With a screaming roar, she takes the skies instead. Over near the wall where the ground weyrs begins, Lanti pauses to lean to the side and glances back at Gai'us to give him an acknowledging nod before disappearing inside the first vacant weyr she finds. Far above, Dedanseth is quickly climbing and angling towards the ocean.

Malarketh doesn't even manage to garner himself a lick of a buck when the gold takes to the skies with a scream. He turns to watch her progress, long neck twisting and turning about as he watches her fly away. Away. Getting smaller. Smaller. Errr yeah. Brown finally makes the next logical step in fanning wings wide and launching into the sky after, belated and a'wiggling his rump in an effort to climb. I'lit? Just standing there. Stunned. ""Malarketh!""

Jesha urks, wobbling her way to some semblance of a standing position 'fore leaning gratefully on B'ane.  ""Thanks, sweetheart.  I swear on the first egg that he doesn't thhhhhh...aw, here we go.""  Locks of salted brown fly forward as wingbeats come awfully close to the group.  Even so her eyes take on that dreamy, unfocused quality that denotes the duality of air and ground.  ""Should prolly walk faster so ... take a load ... off.  The feet.  The legs.""  Durp Jesha talk good.

Gai'us at least doesn't have that much of a dense crowd to move through so as to be toward the front, with Lanti, ducking into the ground weyr after her - though cautious not to touch her, to stay at a respectable enough distance. Gracchuth, for his part, is, despite his late arrival at the corral, among the first to jump to the sky after Dedanseth, trumpeting his charge in response to that scream. His pursuit is metred, however, wings beating regularly as he makes his way out toward that ocean, and any related possible conquest.

""There's bound to be something more comfortable in the ground weyr."" Right? B'ane soldiers Jesha towards the common destination while watching, hawklike, Gai'us and Lanti's admittance. ""C'mon."" He makes the attempt to herd I'lit formally into the same cavern, sympathetic to greenhorns. Aboleoth finds no voice of his own in shadowing Dedanseth with wing beats that skim shallowly in search of velocity.

What Dedanseth lacks in strength, she makes up for in endurance and agility, and she's already showing those skills now.  As the males begin to catch up in the western climb, she barrels tightly to the south and dives, only to pull out of the maneuver with a sharp slap of wings as she banks west again, skimming the glassy ocean and zooming around the mast of a tall ship, causing a bit of turbulence and more than a bit of colorful language.  Language quite liberally echoed in the chosen ground weyr as Lanti swerves to the side to bump hard into the nearest wall.  Eyes closed tightly, she takes her small hip flask from her back pocket and takes a long pull before closing the flask again and tossing it to the bed pallet in the corner.  Her mind torn between her body and Dedanseth's, Lanti is only vaguely aware already of any who might be joining her.

Malarketh fills his wings with every hardy flap, tail wiggling from side to side with each and every effort to gain altitude. So dogged, the work to carry him aloft, that it is only when he is finally there, that Dedanseth has dove and swung to the seas. A snap of frustration leaves his teeth clicking before he is arrowing off to that direction next. Mahogany-dark sides heave with his exertion to catch up once more. I'lit, meanwhile, is left to scowl at the skies, swallowing, and grumbling with a few choice comments. ""Of all the shardinging timing..."" His voice trails off though, feeling that niggling little feeling. You know the one. Yes, that one. The youthful rider sort of wanders his way towards the cavern to loiter at the entrance. Totally don't want to be there.

Gracchuth is not so agile, choosing instead to attempt a strategy, moving off to flank Dedanseth to the right, and maintain a bit more altitude than the gold herself. Strategems in flights are always a gamble, but at least it's better than taking out a sailor or something by accident. In the ground weyr, Gai'us, unconsciously mimicking his dragon's attempts in the air, settles off to the side of Lanti. He doesn't allow himself to lean against any wall, but keeps a wide stance for balance, and turns his gaze to those wandering through - or near to - the entrance. One young bronzerider, who Gai'us feels is getting too close, is warned off with a scowl, and the slightest step forward. 

And he's off -- brown lightning, sepia thunder, all that descriptive stuff.  He's fast for his age, and agile for his bulk.  The span of his klah-sprinkled wings reaches far to cup and push air beneath him to swirl baffled eddies in his wake.  In the meantime his rider has her eyes fixed on the tableau above, primarily on the golden streak of queen, but her eyes shift to take in the competition.  And then to take in B'ane's bicep as she trips over a rock in her staggering daze.

Aboleoth comes ready with long, wide wings manufactured for a conservation of energy. The queen's airborn cotillion is tricky to coordinate with which the veteran bronze meets by purposely slipping a shoulder, constricting various wing spars, and casting out others. It's an act of tripping over sky really for any observers not concerned with the potential capsizing of their boat. His vantage is lower than the gold's where he might read her shadow best as it browses the crests of waves. ""Easy, and you haven't even had anything to drink yet..."" B'ane sags then uplifts Jesha and suddenly wonders where D'baji vanished to.

With a trumped taunt, or maybe it's a warning, Dedanseth looks back at her chasers, already closing on her again.  She banks south, speeding farther from the Weyr with every wingbeat.  East-southeast, the tip of Paradise Isle can just be seen, and the gold seems to be heading straight for it, until she veers left yet again, so sharply that her wingtip skims the waves, sending a spray of mist towards those nearest.  With a heaving downswoop of wings, she then begins to climb again.  In the ground weyr, this takes its toll on Lanti, who slumps against the wall suddenly and has to push herself forward again to assume at least a semblance of a stance.

Oh.  Oh /oh/, you DARE taunt Sevareth, Pern's most ardent lover.  If he could carry a single fellis bloom 'twixt his teeth as he makes his ascent, he would.  Blues are passed, other browns are left shamed and bronzes will not come out of their weyr for months as they weep into their wings for envy of the reserves of strength left in his nearing-ancient bulk and the agility he possesses.  The dull intelligence spinning in his brightly hued eyes serves one purpose right now: reaching the glowing but slowing embrace of Dedanseth.

Malarketh wings about, younthful exuberance making a valiant show despite the fact that all of his muscle mass isn't quite there yet. Stamina? Not quite yet. Nor the wisdom of some of his fellow chaser. But he fairly drips with juvenile vitality. His trumpet is just on this side of challenging, even if he doesn't quite have the mass to back it up. He flags a tad, and then rushes to make a show of it once more. His movements? Ragged and unschooled. All the while I'lit is relying upon the cool stone of the room's walls to give him some relief, even while bony fingers pluck at the front of his shirt, and dark eyes watch forms about the room. ""So, yeah, first flight. When I win, please be gentle with me."" Oh yeah, he said it.

Gracchuth is... on the wrong side. Stratagems work so much better when there are multiple parties at your beck and call. The brown wraps his wings, veers hard, and attempts to right his course. Quite a lot of distance to make up, now, and so Gracchuth does his best to focus on power and speed, straining forward. On the ground, Gai'us stretches his neck forward himself. Movement from Lanti has his head whipping around to peer at the goldrider - and then I'lit's comment brings Gai'us' attention over there. ""Hmph,"" is said with a bit of a smirk that way. Knees bend a bit, though he doesn't exactly crouch. Waiting... feeling the desperation from an out-of-position lifemate.

""Hm?  Oh, no, not drinkin'.  Didn't... didn't wanna see Bajiren while havin' my slosh on.  The drink.  Slosh.""  Jesha manages to right herself and clings more tenaciously to B'ane's arm.  ""Y'know, you smell awful nice for a bronzeridin' guy from Ista.  Not all sweat smelly or nothin'.""  Her eyelashes bat somewhat distractedly and she shimmies herself against his side with a broad grin.  ""Kinda pretty.  Like man-flowers.""

[en Dedans] D'baji dies. Man-flowers.
[en Dedans] B'ane dies.
[en Dedans] Jesha: Hurr hurr, hey baby is your man-flower in bloom?
[en Dedans] Pippa just facepalms.
[en Dedans] Jesha: <3

B'ane's dark eyes exult in the dim refuge the cavern provides. ""Why don't you sit..."" The Samaritan comment doesn't take the lilt indicative of a question as he views the weyrwoman's struggle. Jesha could sure benefit from the same approach. The bronzerider makes due repeatedly pulling wrinkles out of the vest that were eradicated the first time. Squaring Jesha, ""do... I say thank you to that?"" Aboleoth, aligning the hook shape of his snout to the horizon line at first, forces his left wing to an odd trajectory. It provides the folcrum his body pivots against, a semi-circle that rallies the bronze forward hastily, but at the cost of little control over direction.

High endurance or not, that last climb is definitely draining Dedanseth's last reserves.  She is saved somewhat by an updraft of thermals that she catches to rise, then spin back upon her suitors.  With a last blast of furious challenge, she all but spits at them (always attractive), then barrel-rolls toward the north to catch that thermal one last time, wings carrying her upward in an anxious, dizzying spiral.  In the much darker ground weyr, Lanti chokes out a harsh sounding laugh after the young man's comment.  ""You're in the wrong weyr, boy,"" she tells him, but her eyes begin to glaze as Dedanseth's flight really begins to catch her up in the raw emotion.  Lanti's head swivels slightly as she takes in the faces before her, but she staggers away from them.  Well, most of them.  You are on the way to destruction.  You have no chance to survive make your time.

That distance isn't an easy one to recover, and Gracchuth lags all the more as she spirals up, despite spreading his wings wide to catch whatever thermals the gold is using. But the ardour of the pursuit has largely died away, and with eyes turning more green and less yellow, this continuance is posturing, unless a lucky plummet of the gold should bring her within his grasp. Gai'us realises the situation on the ground, too, straightening to a somewhat more relaxed posture - though there's still some tension throughout his frame. ""Faranth,"" is muttered. ""We'll see you after... later."" Only a glance toward the end rightly directs this to Lanti. But, like his dragon, he'll stay the course 'til it's over.

Malarketh falls further behind the others. For all of his gumption and will, it is absolutely no match for the veterans. Relying upon thermals only now, giving him that breath to persist in the face of dwindling odds, the brown keeps up his dogged pursuit, even if it is a trailing one. But maybe, just maybe that last little drift of an unlifting thermal might be found. Back in the cavern, I'lit makes a good show of it, or tries to as well. His chin lifts, arms cross over his thin chest, eyebrows lift as if in challenge, while he blushes. That just ruins it all right there. *shifty-eye*

And there's the opening both rider and brown have been searching for.  ""You can thank me later,"" Jesha drawls in what is probably intended as a sultry manner but just makes her sound like a professional Benden wine-taster.  Hopefully, Dedanseth can also thank Sevareth later.  He's giving the younger whelps a good run for their marks.  Every inch is a victory for him and his nose comes awfully close to being bludgeoned by the flailing golden wingspars.  Tipping himself towards his potential lover, he attempts the time-honored maneuver of sideswiping her into submission.  It'll be worth her while, for sure.

The 'wrists' of Aboleoth's wings open upward where elevation can be grabbed and smoothed under the sterling specks of wing membrane. He's closest to Sevareth after chasing a path around a small bronze with help from the short tail he was born with. Dedanseth's form is stayed with visually even when she's blurred by the loitering of low clouds. Movements are slower now, but more distinct when they occur. The bronze's legs jounce from a pocket of warm air where he readies them to secure any bit of dragon they cross - a lopsided, diagonal grab, snatch, would-be possession from below. B'ane's head rolls back as if he too, might see Dedanseth. 

Both someone former and someone new fall far too distant from Dedanseth's failing fight, while others' strength and experience make up for her agility in spades.  She barely misses Aboleoth's last attempt to catch, but only to collide right into Sevareth's plans.  And wings.  And... everything else.  The gold doesn't even make an attempt to do anything but hold on at that point, something mirrored in the dragon's rider as Lanti uses the last of her presence of mind (or of instinct, really), to stumble toward Jesha, grab her by the collar, and drag her to the corner.  The rest of the contestants can leave or watch.  Neither Dedanseth nor Lanti seem to give even half a care.

And that is Gai'us cue to leave, giving a strained smile at no one in particular as Gracchuth settles for a casual glide back toward the Weyr. On his way out, though, the former Igenite is good enough to tap I'lit's arm and note, ""You'll want to go somewhere away from here, I think."" And then he's out.

""SorryB'aneGottaGo!"" That's about all the widely grinning lady-rider has time to get out before her mouth is quite busy with other interesting and purely procreative things.  Wait...  Anyway, speaking of procreation, Sevareth's wrapped all around Dedanseth, doin' his thing while being chivalrous enough to spread his wings to slow their descent and check their sexy careening.

Malarketh wings away as the gold is caught, allowing his weary wings a respite with a long glide back towards the main island. Almost sounding like a puppy's mournful note of dejection, the brown starts back, lazily hanging a left to a nearby cove. As for I'lit, all of that macho posturing (yeah, you can call it that) falls flat at the loss. More flickered glances here and there, a grunt, and then he is scampering out. Such an awesome welcome to Ista.

Aboleoth veers directly into a head wind - a natural mechanism to slow that's easy on the body. He trails Between silently, his presence no more than a lapse in atmosphere. His rider clears the lower caverns at a speed where his emotional state of mind cannot easily be ascertained.

Leaving both dragons and riders to ride out the last of the flight in privacy.  For the good of all involved, surely.  Or not involved.  Or innocently gawking.  Or those poor sailors below.  Or the drudges who were just about to interrupt Jesha and Lanti.  Yeah.  Look away."

6/15/08

Gather Meadow
You are standing in a wide grassy area that spreads out before you. It rises gradually to meet the hold valley in the west. A road continues through the field over the rise to the Hold's cliff and comes down in the north to the main gather square. To the south you can see a small waterfall tumbling down the hillside, which gathers into a stream and runs toward the sea.
  It is a spring afternoon.  
Above, you see a green dragon.
Bronze Aboleoth is here.
You see a wagonmaster, Dilse Caravan Wagon 1, Dilse Caravan Wagon 3, Dilse Caravan Wagon 4, Dilse Caravan Wagon 5, Dilse Supply Wagon 1, Dilse Supply Wagon 2, Sweet Champagne, Istan Wagon One, Bow, and Archery target here.
Obvious exits:
Beach     Runner Track     Gather Square     Hold Pastures     Hold Valley     Gardens     Barracks

You slide gently down Aboleoth's neck and land with a soft thud.

Nicholarin has arrived.

Aboleoth makes parallel to the slope of shore where a trading group is bivouacked. His flat wings steep some and B'ane consents to the landing some distance away as to not spook the herd animals. Liking higher ground, Aboleoth makes his rider walk that much extra distance to the caravan. Already young children, having seen the bronze's imposing shadow, frolic over.

Travel the world, indeed!  Nicholarin is splitting logs, again, seemingly the only task he's been set since he took up work with the Dilse caravan.  At least he seems rather cheerful about it, the whoosh-/thock/ of wood splitting accompanied by the ragged edges of a half-whistled tune.  The children scattering from their tasks or play and heading toward the dragon are spared a bare glance, Nick pausing his work only a moment before returning to the pattern of set-up-wood, aim, swing, rinse and repeat.

""Can I get a ride? How much does he eat? Can he fart?"" B'ane endures the usual gamut of questions patiently, though giving up trying to fit them all with answers. ""You may go see him, just respect his space alright?"" Aboleoth never encourages children, but has always been tolerant most of the time. His tall rider makes a private excuse to get out of the weight of his riding jacket and nears a youth chopping wood. ""Would you say cutting wood is good for the spirit?""

Nicholarin looks up from his chopping at the question, and rests his arms on the end of the handle, axe head resting on the ground.  ""Good for the spirit?"" he repeats, looking a moment perplexed.  ""It's good for the arms and the back...probably for the legs too.  For the spirit...""  He shrugs and reaches to set up the next piece of wood.  ""You're Shaon's dad, aren't you?""

B'ane stills his steps when another child belatedly races by just in front of him. He smiles very modestly, being fond of children. ""You might not have done it long enough. But for me when I'm working like that I get moments of clarity. I hope someday you find it. Mind if I watch a while?"" His baritone is Istan, but clings to a Tillek throwback. ""No, but Shaon... perhaps one of Shayla and N'ano's get? Yeah, you must be thinking of N'ano, he's a bronzerider of Ista as well: Impressed in the clutch before mine and one I count as a valuable friend.""

""You're not N'ano?"" Nick asks, looking a touch disappointed.  ""You look enough like Shaon I thought you might be.""  But the man's request gets a narrowed look, and Nick replies, ""You want to watch me.  Chop wood.""  This as should B'ane had offered him a thousand marks to shake his hand.  ""I don't understand.""

B'ane jerks his head quickly in a second 'negative.' ""I only have two sons and they're both young still. He, Shaon, must be your friend then?"" The lined leather jacket slips through his hand, draped over the 'done' pile of wood. ""Actually I'd prefer to- excuse me!"" Reaching one of the vendors and miming the gesture of chopping wood. The woman is quick-minded, she knows where there is another.

Nicholarin watches the rider move off, and shakes his head, rather as though he suspects a little instability of the mind there.  But as the man moves off, he turns back to his chore with a dismissive shrug, and makes the next chop.

B'ane lopes back with an ax gripped in one hand. It's in worse shape than Nicholarin's on inspection, but is serviceable. A stick of kindling is balanced upright on the ground and efficiently hacked by the dragonrider with the first powerful swing. ""This kind oozes a lot,"" indicating the sap leeching out of the sudden cut. This one was recently a live tree.

Nicholarin's eyebrows merely raise slighty at the rider's comment, and he continues his chore, the chopping block proving an effective tool in holding the logs.  Finally, though, Nick straightens up, stretching his back a little, and says, ""You do know that this is all very strange, don't you?""  Though the statement may be slightly disconcerting, there's no particular expression on the boy's face, as though he might be remarking on the warmth of the weather.

B'ane might have a very good clue as to what Nicholarin's talking about, but acts otherwise. ""What, cutting wood?"" Glancing up and to the side. The log only partially split with the ax head imbedded halfway, B'ane knocks it against the side of the chopping block during one of Nicholarin's pauses. Two strikes later and it's all the way through.

Nicholarin stops chopping then altogether and leans on the axe again.  ""A bronzerider coming to a trader camp to cut wood.  If you're looking for Rianna, her wagon is in the center of the camp.  If you're looking for someone else, tell me who it is and I'll fetch them.""  Nothing but business there, though Nick does seem keen on being rid of the other man.

B'ane treasures a private type of smile for he soon reveals his true calling this day. ""I'm actually here on Search, this is just me seeing if I still had it in me,"" indeed, the man isn't bad at splitting wood. The head of the ax is made to roost on the chopping block. His stare direct. ""Are there many teenagers in your group here, the Dilse correct?"" 

Nicholarin looks a little relieved at that answer and replies, ""Sure.  There's me and my girlfriend, and several others.""  Perhaps it's ironic that he lists the first two first.  But Nick merely says it as rote listing.  ""This is the Dilse.  But they're enough in need of hands they may not take so kindly to search as a major hold would.""

B'ane takes a large step to set his ax leaning against the completed cord of wood. ""I'll speak with Rianna,"" brushing his hands off. ""But what about you, fancy Standing for a dragon's clutch at all? We have two golds this time, the senior and the most junior of our queens.

Nicholarin looks up, surprised, but not at B'ane's question, but rather at his statement.  ""Lendai's gold?  Lendai's gold was one of the two that rose?""  Nick goes very quiet for a long moment, forgetting even to set his axe aside, and finally murmurs, ""So...she's flown.""

B'ane finishes a single, idle nod of confirmation while taking in the quality of runnerbeasts left inside a makeshift corral. ""Rider, do you need anything? We have much that's new since your last visit."" Another woman walks over to ask. B'ane thinks. ""Charcoal? I'm always in need of that."" The trader gladly affirms, ""some, yes! I will bring them to you."" He indicates his thanks.  

Nicholarin finally sets his axe aside and rubs his damp hands on his trousers.  ""Suppose I'll want to come up for the hatching, then,"" he murmurs, though not with the attitude of one accepting an invitation.  In fact, he pulls a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes his face, before saying, ""I should go help with lunch.""

B'ane widens a grin when the woman actually runs towards him with a small bundle wrapped in string. ""Thank you, Kina,"" offering her a full mark. ""Keep the rest."" Back to Nicholarin when the trader returns to her wagon, ""the name's B'ane of Aboleoth if you decide to change your mind. I'll be with Rianna for a small while anyway."" Exhausted with the children, Aboleoth, arranged in a loose glide, is now airborn over the wagons. 

""Change my mind about what?"" Nick asks, looking a little perplexed.  ""I'm sorry--did you need something else?  Wood?  An axe?  Was that why you wanted to try it out?""  He's not thick, exactly, maybe just wasn't paying attention...or took the rider's suggestion as a jest.

""Should you want to come with us - I'll be back."" B'ane affords a few more specifics to the young trader before finding Rianna's wagon on his own with long strides. That much he thinks he's familiar with. The woman who found the charcoal points the way regardless in the name of hospitality.

At which point Nick takes off at a run.  Running, to be specific, from one wagon to the next, poking his head through the door of some, and looking under others.  The only one he doesn't approach is Rianna's.  He even ranges out a little from the camp, looking under bushes and even going as far as the stream.  By the time the rider reemerges, though, Nick is simply perched on the chopping block, sharpening the blade of the axe.

Aboleoth thinks to you, << I bespoke Nicholarin with << You sense that Aboleoth is enlightening as the turning of a page and yet inobtrusive as static. He doesn't speak, doesn't have to to read this one's strongest thoughts. But the dragon begins to burrow in his rider's decided absence. >>

Loudly bounds down the stairs leading down from the lead trader's wagon in considerable more animation than what he left with. ""Rianna offers permission. If you see your friends, be sure they're aware of that."" B'ane doesn't look up even though he knows that's where his life-mate is to be found. Aboleoth steadily drifts on the motions deep wing beats avail him.

""My friends?"" Nick repeats blankly.  ""What do you mean, tell my friends?  Besides, if I'm going with you, I won't be able to tell anyone anything.""  Because they'll gag him and tie him up!  Well, not really.  ""Look, I do want to come with you, but could I take a runner up to the Weyr first thing tomorrow?  Or...do I have to go right now?""

B'ane's deep eyes are reduced by a heavy squint. ""You could do that easily, it won't be before three sevendays before the first clutch is hatching. What's your name?"" Aboleoth dips his large left wing low, the fulcrum his body uses while grasping for ground to land on. He waits, his gaze long at a distance.

Aboleoth thinks to you, << I bespoke Nicholarin with << You sense that Aboleoth explores recent memories, audits mundane life events, then suddenly retracts. Your mind is deserted once more, privacy restored, but so suddenly Empty. >>

""Really?"" And Nick couldn't possibly look more surprised.  He takes a deep breath.  ""My name is Nicholarin.  My mother is Weaver Journeywoman Clovinia.""  That last added just in case they need to know that bit as well.  ""I'll come up in the morning, then.  Who should I report to?""

It still pains him to this day to put on full riding gear so close to the planet's equator, but B'ane does restore his jacket to his torso and fits all the toggles. ""Our headman goes by the name of Martin and if you can't find him, Minka is Weyrwoman, she'll be easier to locate: on the hatching grounds. But only go there through the galleries to preserve the peace."" Although not actually smiling he gives an aura of it. ""Good to meet you, Nicholarin.""

""Well met to you to...ah...?""  And yes, if the rider gave his name, Nick has forgotten it.  He turns to give the rider, and his bronze lifemate, a surprisingly elegant bow.  ""I'll come to the Weyr tomorrow.""

B'ane's departure is a combined effort of walking fast and running to his dragon. ""B'ane!"" Calling out again on the ground just before his body ascends onto the middle-sized Aboleoth. It's the trader children who lament the most, one little boy even crying. All engage in enthusiastic waves when at a distance safe enough for the Istans to take wing for home.

Nicholarin, however, settles himself well on the chopping block and just stays there."

Lzi's Wild Love Shack
Dramatically high and carved out of a beautifully light wood, a bed piled high with pink pillows and blankets is set against the farthest wall, the first focus upon entering. Directly in front from the bed is a small, oddly shaped white fur with pillows thrown on top of it, which is aptly named a pillow couch. Near the pillow couch is a large cabinet made of the same wood color as the bed, completely packed with an impressive variety and supply of alcohol, and near the cabinet is a white couch. On the other side of the room is a desk and a dresser, made out of the same light wood as the rest of the furniture. Near the desk is a curtained exit, leading into a small closet area containing extra dressers. A table is set in the back corner, by which there is a curtain leading off into the bathing area. Izlasth's own sleeping area is in the back, small but cozy for the green dragon. Over most of the floor there is a cream colored fluffy fur rug, providing a very nice cushion to the feet as well adding a sensual feel to the room.
  It is a spring sunset.  
You see Moldy Egg Moronth, Bramble bush, Abstract Woman Sculpture, Lykane, Linnau, Lannin, Ozzy, and Ayden here.
You notice Kaedi asleep here.
Lzi is here.
Obvious exits:
Ledge

It's relatively quiet in Lzi's weyr at the moment...except for the sound of little Lannin pestering his mother with questions. Lzi herself is busying herself by getting toys and clothes put away while the children are napping or out for the day. ""But mommy, /why/ are you so short? Am I gonna be tall like daddy or short like you?"" ""Sweetie, honey, baby, I don't know, okay? Why don't you go and put away your wooden dragon, huh?"" Lannin stops temporarily to look at said dragon before more questioning continues. ""Why does Lykane have blue eyes when you and daddy and me all have brown?"" A hand goes up to the greenriders forehead as she just groans, wishing the questions would stop.

Aboleoth scatters the pattern of rain as his wings compose the various turns and ministrations it takes to land on Izlasth's ledge. B'ane and Lykane admit themselves in briskly, covered only with a thin waxed skin. ""It's still rainin',"" Lykane assures his mother and brother realistically. ""Yah you ain't kiddin'."" The bronzerider shakes the skin off the best he can in preparation for a short stay. ""You looked harried,"" smiling faintly at Lzi.

The arrival of B'ane with Lykane provides Lzi with an out, immediately pointing in their direction. ""Go ask your father."" Famous last words. Lykane gets a warmer greeting from his mother, including a soft smile in his direction. ""You have clean, dry clothes waiting for you sweetie. They're on your bed."" Then, the greenrider finally addresses B'ane. ""It's all him. He's exactly like you. Questions all day long out of this one. I'm tired of talking, tired of coming up with answers that make him happy.""

B'ane runs any water off the crown of his head. ""Dry clothes, like Thread, no longer exist. Thank you, though I might as well save 'em for tomorrow. Hey Lin,"" his youngest son is brought up into his arms. ""What's all this about questions? You should ask all the more, it's good for you to think. And you make others think by asking. You two are smart boys."" Lykane, entertained by some new object, runs to a private location where he won't be bothered. ""Shards are crops are ruined..."" B'ane laments while looking outside. Aboleoth is hunched, tossing his head as water drips off him like a stationed gargoyle.

""Daddy, /why/ are the crops ruined?"" comes out of Lannin next, staring curiously at his father. Lzi, in a mood, completely ignores her son, not giving B'ane any chance to answer him. ""I'm so sick of rain. Not that I really liked when it rained here anyway, but look..."" Her body is gestured to. ""I'm losing my tan!"" That's practically a sin while living at Ista. ""I'm thinking about flying somewhere to tan, no joke. I can't take living indoors anymore. I feel like I could go crazy. There are only so many things to do indoors with kids.""

B'ane licks his lips. ""Because things die when they get too wet,"" unsure how aware Lannin is of finite concepts like death. ""There's a lot more things to be worried for that skin tone. I hear they've been rounding up livestock into cave systems to get them dry, but of course they have to supply all their feed. But they need sunlight to be healthy - already I here fungus is a problem on them."" Setting Lannin down, ""have you tried just letting them out?"" 

The answers seems to appease Lannin, who turns quiet for the time being. ""Who knew a little rain could cause all of this trouble?"" Lzi sighs, tossing a stuffie into a chest before flopping down on the nearby couch. B'ane's question gets a snort of laughter. ""Okay, B'ane. /You/ try letting four kids out in the rain to play /and/ keep your weyr clean afterwards. Kids attract dirt and everything dirty. Not only do they bring the dirt in, but then it gets in their clothes, and it's practically impossible to get out. Plus, the last time I let them play outside in the rain, Lannin got that horrible cold, remember?""

B'ane furthers a few more steps into the weyr, hands on his hip bones. ""Why they don't need clothes at that age. You can always have them jump in the lake before you bring them in?"" Seemingly serious. ""I can't believe children would be as docile as herdbeasts in similar caves. Or,"" lowering his voice an octave as not to alarm the boys, ""I know a good family in Keroon, remember Frejon? He wouldn't mind, he has that vineyard and dairy cothold and surely wouldn't mind Lin and Kane to play with his sons. Or there's, well you don't know Atar and Sarud, they settled right around Key Hold. They're good people, I'd trust them wholeheartedly.""

Lzi raises a brow as she regards B'ane carefully, slowly. ""As in...sending them there to stay for awhile until the rain passes, or just taking them there to visit?"" she finally asks when she does speak, that brow still arched up high into her forehead. Some of her energy regained, Lzi stands then, placing herself in front of B'ane, which causes her to have to crane her neck so that she can stare up at him. Either people are getting taller or she's getting shorter.

B'ane troubles his bottom lip with a thumb and index finger. ""What about a sevenday? If the weather doesn't let up by then, shells I don't even want to think about that, then maybe longer. It'd be a good opportunity for them to be more adaptable and independent."" His eyes catch Lzi's. ""Shall we ask them and see?""

For as much as Lzi might not be maternal, she sure looks hesitant as she considers B'ane's suggestion. Finally, a sigh and a nod. ""I suppose. They'll probably love it so much that they won't want to come home, rain or no rain. I just worry about baby Lannin. He still seems so young to me, and I hate for him to feel like we abandoned him or something like that. But, I suppose we can always go and visit, right?"" Knowing Lzi, she'll be there more often than she'll admit to, leaving her precious sons there alone.

B'ane's posture turns a few degrees. ""I think they'd be alright, but visits would be a good decisions. Frejon has eleven children, seven boys, and of them all shades of ages around our two. I know there's one Lannin's age because they were born in consecutive months. Hey you two, come here! Your mother and I have something to ask!"" Lykane's a little tardy after taking apart a hinge.

Lzi gets down on a knee, grabbing Lannin by the waist, looking both boys in the eyes, but mainly talking to her younger son. ""So, your father and I were talking about how you guys have been cooped up here with the rain and all, and we were thinking that maybe you'd like to go somewhere else and stay for awhile."" Eyes flick to B'ane for help and support, and really for him to tell them the rest since she is fuzzy on the details.

""I think Keroon might be the better option. Frejon's got kids all your ages, and lots of fields, ponds, all sorts of  animals ahoof and awing, and sunshine."" The father grins boyishly. ""It'll only be for a few days and we'll visit of course."" Lykane, undaunted by much, asks, ""can Jiren come?"" B'ane predicted this. ""I'd have to ask D'baji about that. What do you think, Lannin?""

Secretly a momma's boy, Lannin glances in Lzi's direction, who smiles warmly and nods just barely. Lannin nods then too, turning to look at his dad. ""Okay."" And that's all he has to say about it. A kiss is given to him before Lzi scoops him up into her arms, holding him close to her. ""Like dad said, we'll come and visit you as often as we can. You guys will have a great time.""

B'ane is pleased. ""Growing boys need sunshine to grow big and tall,"" partially true anyway. ""Your mother and I, see, we can handle overcast skies. I'll write Frejon a message then and get it to him tonight."" Asking Lzi softly, ""you sure you don't mind this?""

With that taken care of, the boys are pushed back in the direction of their bedroom, Lzi pushing herself to stand soon afterwards. A shrug comes then, as does a sigh. ""I'm going to miss them. I mean, I haven't been away from them for that long ever, and it's tough to think about. But I guess I'll survive. It's not like they are my only kids. But B'ane, what if the rain /doesn't/ end in a sevenday? Do we just let them stay there until it stops or should we set some kind of limit?""

B'ane fills his lungs with a new breath. ""If it doesn't we'll see if they want to come back to Ista regardless. If they want to stay any longer than that or come back again we'll have to ask Frejon and Marta's opinion."" Lykane trots back to his disassemblage. ""I know what you mean,"" B'ane watches him go. ""He's enjoyable to talk to now, I'm learning how to see him as a person rather than something that eats, sleeps, and chatters."" Which is no slight to Lannin in the slightest.

Lzi grins after Lykane, nodding. ""I know what you mean. He's turning into you more and more everyday."" An affection grin is then turned to B'ane, soft eyes staring up at him. ""Sometimes I think Lykane is wise beyond his years. It's so hard to think of him as a five turn old and not a twenty turn old."" A glance is sent in the direction of there bedroom and more smiling occurs then. ""I wish I could freeze them at this age. I don't want them to get any older, if only because that means I'm getting older too. And speeeaking of getting older,"" Lzi says with a wicked grin. ""Happy turnday. You didn't think I'd forget, did you?"" A box is grabbed and handed to him. ""You can open it later. I hope you like it.""

In case Lzi had any doubts, ""you should have heard him burp today. Although... I do know some of twenty Turns who still do that vigorously."" B'ane cuts a look to the woman, bereft, ""no, but I did! At least until this afternoon when Lykane reminded me."" Hands take the size of the box, remarking happily, ""still no schooner eh? Good I will, first I want to see what Lykane's doing with that rusty hinge. I'm not sure where he picked it up from.""
ooc :takes care of chicken feed. ""I'll be on more this week definitely.""

There's a laugh and a roll of her eyes at both the burp comment and the rusty hinge comment. ""Go."" Lzi pushes him in the direction of the bedroom, going back to folding clothes."

Emerald Beach 
The sand here is very soft underfoot, as you walk along this secluded strop of beach.  The beach itself is only about half a dragonlength wide here, as it skirts around the turquoise waters of Emerald Cove.  To the south lies more beach, and the open waters of the cove roll up from the east.  The calm waters get deep quickly, only a few feet from shore.  
It is a winter sunset.   
To the south, you see a bronze dragon. 
Gliding above are Antny, Phoenix, Scooter, Fierce, Kaniculi, Shiva, Nefertiti, Budgie, Shamrock, Rune, Hippolyta, and Tanis. 
You see Dark Cave here. 
You notice Rowress asleep here. 
Kia, Shava, Apholone, Ceran, Treirluperak, Miaren, M'nty, and Rielle are here. 
Obvious exits: 
Water     Dolphin Track     North Emerald Beach     South Emerald Beach

Apholone smiles at the other people who have impressed, hoping that maybe he still has a chance. He drops some fresh meat into his hand and extends it towards the newly hatched blue, ""Here fine fellow, how about some of this fresh  wherry.""  He smiles and maintains his positive attitude, he would try and maybe a beautiful firelizard would be his too. 

Rowress has no clue why she got dragged here again but many people have said that firelizards were rather smart so... why not listen to them? This time,  she's been pestered to bring some juicy red meat along just because her firelizards seem to get sick of the honey in Ressy's meatrolls. Why should Ressy complain though? It meant more meatrolls for her! 

Pesalta calls to Archangel, who flies over and lands on her shoulder. 

Miaren quickly digs into her pack, finding the fresh fish she had caught that  morning just for this. Offering it to her newly impressed green flit, who  gobbles it up quickly, she keeps a small bit of attention on the crowd and the  remaining eggs to keep up with what goes on, and almost all of it on her green. 

Pulsing Magnetic Egg shatters into a thousand fragments, leaving its occupant out in the open. 

<b>Stunning and Magnetic Polaris Green Hatchling 
Lime glitters along her narrow head, frothing as it strikes her neck and crisping to a sour apple as it tarnishes her wings. Succeeding to dominate large billowing wings in a watered down jade, that same green pools in thick splotches against her hips and mote her back. Honey and cream gently surges up  from her rounded belly, and against her throat, ending just before it hits her  wedged jawline. Her head is framed with delicate peridot headknobs that sweep back. Metallic green can be seen peppering down her ridged back and against  those highly feminine paws.  A last touch is the darker shades of mint that seem to play in shimmering sheets on the highlights of her skin where feminine muscle bulks.</b>  

More food is found, shutting the boy up for a few precious seconds before said food goes just as quickly to his new companion's stomach. Ceran's face falls again, handing the creeling green to his 'nanna', ""Take her.. I gotta go find  more food!"" He states before trotting quickly back out of view before he stops as he sees someone offering him food! So his plan to go and steal some unnoticing observer is put on hold, wary steps carrying him to the male as he eyes him cautiously. He's a stranger. Stttrrraaaannngggerrrr, thus needs  observing. The boy is quiet before a creel from his green is heard, an a bite of his Nanna's fingers, ""Yes!.. Can you share some for me? Shes hungry!"" And so she is. 

Pesalta has disconnected. 

Treirluperak calls congrats to the ones that impress, and just continues watching. 

Forgotten Who I Am Egg RAAAAWRs!!  Well, not quite.  But with a sudden sharp cracking, a tridactyl limb punches right out through a weak spot of the shell, minute claws extending and slicing through the already fractured shards, until the owner rolls out into a pile of wings slicked with slime and traces of natal blood.  Head flicking about with quick shakes, the little firelizard seems at once confused and terrifying and strangely deadly for something so little. 

Shava listens and nods at the names. ""Alright, I'll remember that. Skyraider?""  She sort of tilted her head, then shook it, ""I don't think I'll ever understand where the names of the wings for the Weyrs comes from. They sometimes make sense, and other times just don't. Must be some sort of tradition involved, right?"" 

Nogagon wanders up along the beach, blinking a little as he finally spots his mini-fair of firelizards... Humming at a hatching. He, of course, wanders right up to it, idly fingering the pouch of dried meat at his side, but just watching, for now. 

Forgotten Who I Am Egg shatters into a thousand fragments, leaving its occupant out in the open. 

<b>Unyielding Warrior Wolverine Bronze Hatchling 
A glint of greenish-gold catches the eye, shimmering in the light off the hide  of this nearly iridescent bronze. He is a stout, somewhat chunky fellow, but  unwavering and unyielding in his strength. His muscles are chiseled, and a  combination of smooth and sharp edges, combining to give him an air of  unpredictability. The outstretches of his wings are graceful and solid, filled  in with a silvery membrane reminiscent of solid adamantite, stretched thin over  the fingers of his sails. Special notice may be drawn to the sharp talons that  protrude from his somewhat clumsy-looking paws - the claws a bit larger than  they might usually be.</b>  

Uiije shuffles his way through the mini trenches of sand, the cane at his side  making odd indentations to the right of his general footprints. ""Relax? Ha!  There's so such word!"" Imparting a rugged, though not exactly a dingy-toothed smile, he gently pokes a lad that has his rear in the air trying to entice a blue and then smirks. ""Make way for the old uncle, will ye lad?"" He joins up with Kia after his fight through the mob. He has no injuries at least. The hatchings are given passing glances, wondering if he might content himself with  allowing the younger generation to have their fun with animals like he had once upon a time.   

Gentle Blue Beast Hatchling leans back, once hatched, taking a moment to survey and gather information rather than immediately launch after food. Oh, -interesting-. He rocks forward on impressive haunches, blue body a tumble rather too large for his hue. Forelimbs, backlimbs: it makes no difference. He is dexterous with all applicable body parts, putting them to use as he shoulders in search of the all-important food. Well now... 

Kia says, ""There is a bit of a tradition but I don't think it follows any set pattern."" the various hatchlings do get a glance now and she eyes the leftovers of the raw wherry. ""I know you think I should share. I suppose but only if they ask for it. I'm not giving handouts for free you know."" she sniffs at this last. Uiije's arrival has a giggling again ""Glad to see you out and about. Getting a bit of air are you? The Weyr can get rather stuffy at times. We've eggs of our own that'll be clutching soon. Eh Uiije?"" 

Apholone continues watching the blue as another green and a second bronze hatch from their eggs, he tries extending his hand a littler further towards the hatchlings and grinning speaks up to them, ""Come this way Hatchlings, I will give you fresh food everyday, I can promise you that."" 

Stunning and Magnetic Polaris Green Hatchling has arrived! Little gasp, with lungs filling with air quickly then lend a primal scream to her little voice.  Eyes instantly fading from that cool mint green to something of blistering reds. Her belly aches, and with an experimental flap, kicks away her previous  home.  Greener than the greenest.  Positively glowing as her slender body snakes onto the sands, snapping up any scrap she can find to feed her bird-like appetite. 

Rielle waves at M'nty. Act her age?! Hmmph. That's no fun. Ignoring the scolding of the bronzerider, Rielle continues to waggle her offering gifts.  Doesn't matter if she Impresses, she's here to welcome! And welcome she does, beaming at each hatchling as though she were a clutching gold. Oh how sickening. Her bronze and brown 'lizards are perched upon her shoulders, a deep hum coming from their throats, and her green flitters about, chirruping.  

""Look a' all o' 'em! Li'l guys are bustin' shell like nothin'."" Ildiko comments, waggling a piece of wherry back and forth. Though the bronze in particular catches her eye. ""Ooooh! I go' t' say, I rather like the look o' 'im. Strapping an' all."" She mutters out loud. ""Might a' well give i' a try,  eh?"" A half-grin forms on her face and the weyrbrat settles in. ""C'mon now, ye  wee li'l hatchlin's. 'less all see wha'cha are made o'."" 

M'nty peered down at the kidlet. He'd not expected the thing to actually come over to him. Shards. He should be more careful or something. ""Yeah, kid. I'll  give you some of my lunch. If you tell me what your name is."" He rummaged in one of the sacks and produced a bag of meatrolls. He held it above the kids head and wiggled it. ""And... maybe your new flizzen's name. Who's she?"" Then he nudged Rielle with his foot... right on her behind. ""Girl... Do I have to tell  you again! You don't need more mouths to feed. You're a nanny for sh- shoes...  sake."" He grimaced, almost cursing in front of the youngster. 

Magen throws her head back and laughs at the antics of those around her, trying their darn-dest to coerce the tiny stomachs. And the antics of the hatchlings being just as endearing. Shava gave a nod to Uiije at his arrival, though would wait until noticed before saying anything. ""I'm sure if someone was bored and wanted to look it up, they probably could, but how accurate it would be, I'm not sure, probably not very."" She looked back at the crowd. ""Do you recall how many eggs there were when this started? Five?"" 

Unyielding Warrior Wolverine Bronze Hatchling flicks his head one way and then the next one more time, dislodging any last lingering bits of Generic Egg Goo and hunkering down in a martial crouch, eyes flickering reds and oranges.  Running on instinct alone, he's gotta get food, he knows that much.  Food,  food, food, c'mon, where IS it?  Lunging suddenly with his claws, he succeeds in sending one rather weak female hoping for something pretty shrieking away, but unfortunately she takes her food with her.  

Gaia blinks in from ::between::!

Rielle reaches up cheerfully and tugs on M'nty's riding pants. ""Oh come on. At least sit with me. Humor me, just this once?"" A shriek makes her head turn, and she squints at that bronze. ""Competitive little one, isn't he?"" A chuckle ripples from Rielle's lips, as she continues watching, just laying the strips of meat out over her pouch. M'nty's right, no use wiggling them for trouble...  But they're still there, if a flizard wants them. 

Treirluperak continues to just sit and watch the hatchlings and people trying for them, calling out congrats when needed. Nogagon tilts his head at the Wolverine bronze, then chuckles softly. ""That one'll be a handful."" he says, slowly fiddling with the tie to his belt pouch of firelizard treats. The boy turns to the closest person, whoever that may be,  and asks, ""What do you think of that one?"" pointing to the same bronze. 

Ceran steals a glance back behind him with his sister and the bunch and his little new one! Ohhhhh! His little flizzen. He gets on his tip-toes, jumping and swatting at the bag, ""Hey! I want some of that!"" He declares before, ""I'm Ceran! Can I have some of that?"" Another jump before he realizes that his  strategy just doesn't seem to be working, so he surrenders, ""I don't got a name for her yet. /YET/. I need to feed her though!"" He says and jumps again, little fingers missing the bag by inches. He sighs, staring longingly up at the bag before grimacing, hearing his name called, though not in a happy way, ""If you give those to me, I'll let you help me name her?"" He suggests hopefully, though tries another jump and a swipe at the bag, ""Please can I have some?"" 

Rowress eyes the bronze hatchling before shrugging to herself. ""He's a lil grouch."" Of course, she doesn't mind the violent ways he acts cause coming to think of it, Ressy is a danger to everyone around her as well. That also includes her. She trips over someone's foot before getting back up again with a 'Sorry ma'am' and a cheerful smile. 

Uiije stops his gimpy walk and leans accordingly to his right side - the one support with the fellis-wood staff. Give him a beard, a robe and he could be a dead-ringer for Gandalf. ""I was visiting my brother'n-law, Finlen over there, but the rogue seems to want to keep to himself. Shah."" Disdain colors his words, but is in fact on good terms with his next of kin. ""Yes, eggs-a plenny soon enough. Hi. G'day, no?"" Beams all around for the audience, the ex-Herder unwilling to spare no one. ""Oy gavalt! What a vicious thing. He's positively  stunning."" Sea-grey eyes trickle down to the Unyielding Warrior Wolverine Bronze Hatchling. ""Hold yer runners, I got somethin' to fix that stomach pang. My, look at me,"" Kia is then re-focused on, ""I'm playing the wet-nurse to a 'lizard."" A freshly caught fish, still writhing in death-throws, is throw onto the ground near the bronze. ""Take it or leave it. Or I'll eat it."" Bwa. 

Stunning and Magnetic Polaris Green Hatchling snort. You aren't BLIND are you?  Do you not see this mass of sparkly-goodness?  She's hungry, do you not know that's what an open mouth and those gut-wrenching screams are about? There's nothing coy about it, and her bronze and blue siblings are given a competitive  snort. She's hungry and someone will feed her now.

Apholone watches the hatchlings with a smile, his outstretched hand still offering the freshly damp wherry-meat.  ""Come this way Hatchlings, fresh meat everyday, just step my way.""  He glances at the other people around him and than back at the hatchlings and focuses intently on them, if only one would step his way.  Maybe the tiny green would, or her brother, the bronze, just one he hopes for, one to care and stuff full of freshly hunted goodness. 

Ildiko blinks back with surprise, ""Tha' lad 'as some bite t'him!"" She exclaims, wrinkling her nose slightly but then only shrugging. ""Tha's the kind o' 'lizard I wouldn' mind 'aving. He can hold 'is own, tha's for shardin' sure!"" A few more bits of meat are placed onto her hand and she lowers it down. Better to get at it that way. ""Jus' gotta come an' get i', fellow! S'all yours an' more."" 

Kia's attention is caught by the shrieking female and she whistles lowly ""Boy that one shouldn't have been here. Did she think these little beauties were all cute and no bite. They are cousins to the dragons after all."" Is said mostly to herself. Pet peeve perhaps. ""I think they're all looking rather desperate."" her meat is eyed again and she shifts to her knees from her sitting position ""Well here's what I've got I suppose Astet can share.""

Gentle Blue Beast Hatchling looks marginally amused, casting a look at this feral clutchmate of his attracting so much attention. He clears out of the bronze's direction, not caring to interfere in the maul-- Impression. He keeps an eye out for someone a bit more discerning, and able to see through to the obvious blinding intelligence he displays. Just how he displays this is unclear, but rest assured, he's confident of it. 

Miaren is still feeding Jubilee, though the gorging seems to have slowed. Watching the hatching out of the corner of her eye, she silently agrees with  the other people's thoughts on the hatchlings. Suddenly, a wait n her leg tells her Jubilee is asleep, and she puts the remaining meat away and picks up the flit, cradling her in the crook of her elbow, content to watch the rest of the hatching for now. 

An urf for Rielle, and M'nty's shaking his head again at her. ""Maybe... Maybe  I'll sit..."" He grouched for a moment, then grinned down at the jumping kid in front of him. ""Pleasure to meet you Ceran. Name's M'nty... and sure..."" He drops the bag down to a height where the next jump would snag it out of the air. ""Go feed her before she creels your head off and makes you eat yourself from the inside."" He grinned at the 12 turn old's hyper-ocity. Then he settled himself down by Rielle. ""You want me to help you try and attract one of these  monsters?"" He raised an eyebrow. ""I adore the creatures though..."" Lasera chirruped at that, and both the green and the blue lurked closer to the hatchlings, just to be in the way. 

Shava hears the shrieking female as well, looking back over. ""Yeah, that I always try to remember whenever I look at them."" She reaches into her rucksack and pulls out a small bag. ""This is been saved for Tanis on this trip, as well as any of the others that decided to come and bug me for food instead of hunting on their own. I think I'll save these for those that need food after they've Impressed."" 

Unyielding Warrior Wolverine Bronze Hatchling seems to care less about his shrieking green clutchmate.  It's well known that firelizards of -his- sort  have a yen for golds instead.  And the more uncatchable the better, especially if they've got reddish highlights to their hide... Ahem.  Food, food, food.  Rawr.  And it looks like his snarling's starting to pay off.  Lots of offers,  but which one to go after?  Who to turn to?  Who to trust? 

Apholone chuckles at the blue as he moves for the bronze and stretches the handful of food more in his direction, ""This way Gentle Blue, I'll take care of you, and we'll enjoy much meat together."" He moves to check the blue's attention, or maybe the hungry green. Either of the beautiful hatchlings would do, just one, maybe even the bronze, but Apholone doesn't count himself that lucky... 

Nogagon finally gets the pouch containing dried meat open, but seems more interested in nibbling on it himself than feeding it to any firelizards. ""So, what do you reckon of this clutch, then?"" he asks, of no-one in particular. He doesn't seem to care if no-one answers his questions, he keeps on asking them. 

Treirluperak shakes his head as he watches the hatchlings and folks trying.  ""Good luck."" He comments softly. 

Rowress settles against a rock and decides to have a bit of fun with the grouch of a bronze. A nice red juicy meat is hung at the end of her rod as she moves the rod sideways, teasing the bronze hatchling. Well let's just see if he could get the piece of meat.  

The brat lets out a victorious cry as he sweeps up the bag from the ground, offering his never-ending beam to the man as a rushed 'Thank you' is stomped out, and he bolts back over to his nanny. He might have been scolded again for his running away, given excess chores, but oh no. He'd left the rather sly green with the poor woman, and seeing her /elation/ when the boy turns back up with the -bag- full of meatrolls is enough for her to dismiss his shouts with a wave of her hand. Ceran giggles and doesn't utter a word to anyone but his new, precious little green, ""I'm baa-aack."" He coos softly, pulling out a piece and  watching her gulp it down with the pride a father would have. Giggle. Feed. Creel. Feed again. Ahhhh. 

Uiije is a former Beasthealer. Any sort of animal, whether possessing intelligence or not receives a soft spot in his heart. People though, eh, it's another different story. ""I just don't know, what's better to get deadbeat firelizards moving,"" mainly, his indifferent blue and brown back at the Chateau De In Laws. ""One with big claws or one with some intelligence in his eye?"" Maybe it's a 'see no evil, hear no evil,' catch twenty-two thing. ""It's too bad  I didn't have the sense to bring my cushion to sit on."" Because there's no way he's going to risk getting these wannabe-Chinos dirty with sand. ""But, I think I can still bend over."" Last time he checked, anyway. He did his stretches his morning. ""Alright you, this is a fish. You're a firelizard. You eat fish. So what's the dilemma?"" Maybe it's his brassy attitude which scares the bronze away.  

Gentle Blue Beast Hatchling rather likes this idea of 'enjoy much meat together'. Attention duly checked, he ambles over in Apholone's direction gamely, his movements and creels together suggestive of a rather lengthy monologue involving words best referenced in the dictionary. However, hey:  food! Making his decision to the one cleave to the one being sensible enough to know quality, he latches on to Apholone's offer, cries momentarily silenced. 

Gentle Blue Beast Hatchling's cries turn joyous, and he turns towards Apholone, creeling piteously. 

Rielle giggles at M'nty. ""No I'm not asking for your help, I think I can do it myself. But you're right, I do have plenty of mouths to feed."" her eyes follow each of the hatchlings for a moment, their antics causing her to laugh softly. The food is still nestled on her pouch, thanks to her guarding of it - yes, even from her own flitters who might want to sneak a bite. ""No, no. It's for the /little ones/"" she scolds, waving off Toast from swooping in to snatch something. Guilty for doing so, however, she pulls extra food from the pack and sets it aside for her flitters, a couple of which dive down to snatch up their  bites, and maybe a bit extra. 

Stunning and Magnetic Polaris Green Hatchling is bored. Is hungry.. If no one will feed her she'll simply find her meals by herself in the wild.  Who needs this type of stress.  Wings flaring and giving a test flap, hoping to defy gravity with aid of her wings. 

Kia nods towards Shava ""A good idea. I always feel so sorry for them when they cry out. But then again it's just part of life. If we weren't here they'd risk being attacked by tunnel snakes and other things."" Uiije and his cajoling of the bronze have her grinning ""Mayhap he's just difficult, one never knows about the attitudes of these firelizards. Especially when they're jsut hatched and starving. Don't see why they'd refuse good fish though. I might have to stop and pick me up some on the way home"" 

Metallic Straps Egg hatches too! Cause they love you too o_o; Metallic Straps Egg shatters into a thousand fragments, leaving its occupant out in the open. 

<b>Glowing Hands Havoc Brown Hatchling 
This brown is...short.  Not in terms of height, but in terms of length.  Short and stocky, muscles bunch together in what must certainly pack a powerful punch, but looks a little clumsy in such a compact form.  A blocky jaw structure broadens the head, too, an even, gentle chestnut the constant, uniform color which bathes his body evenly throughout.  Eyes are wide, and widespread, giving him a strange, direct stare, everything about his muzzle and face composed of startling, strong angles.  His wings, too, are jut a tad broader than one might expect, contributing to the impression of compact power and steady strength which resides within this brown firelizard.</b>  

M'nty watched the little bratling dash back to his nanna and chuckled. Huh...  crazy kid. Then he nodded at Rielle, ""Fine... but I'm just telling you, don't say I didn't warn you when or if you impress another one of these adorable creatures who are just likely to eat you out of house and home."" He snorted, he was becoming slightly more jaded as time went on. Dote on your own, but don't get any more. That's his philosophy. Lasera, his green, fluttered up and settled near Toast, chirruping in a scolding manner. That any of *her* sons  were trying to steal food from babies was just appalling. M'nty chuckled and beckoned his blue back. Well, gray, but blue... And fed the creature a meatroll. ""Now... which ones have caught your eye?"" He nudged Rielle with a grin. 

Apholone scoops up the Gentle blue hatchling and feeds him slowly, no need to choke himself while getting to a ful belly. Apholone wrestles his pack until his shoulder and scoots a bit away from the clutch and the crowd of people, he maintains a watch over the hatching to see which way it goes, but contrates mostly on the Blue nestled in his arms. 

Nogagon suddenly goes from standing, to sitting with his legs crossed, all in one fluid movement. That done, he watches the firelizards, but doesn't start offering food just yet. There are plenty of people already doing that, he figures. He glances to the green, then tosses her a scrap of meat, cause he's kind like that. 

Shava shook her head at Uiije and leans over to Kia, ""Is he always like that?""  she indicates the man. She has set the bag of herdbeast meat beside her, letting it just sit there, waiting for all the hatchlings to Impress or go wild. 

Treirluperak just sits and watches the hatching, not taking much part of it as he had the last two times, deciding to just watch. 

Rumaging through her carrysack, Magen pulls out a small neatly wrapped cloth package. Holding it to her nose, she takes a smell of the unknown. ""It doesn't smell too bad."" Carefully she begins to unfold the napkin, one corner at a time. Aware of the starving hatchlings curiosity, she winks. ""If you would only be a little patient."" Spreading the feast before the hatchling... 

Uiije laments to whomever's ill-fated enough to be in close proximity. ""I'm getting too old for this."" Knees cracking, he stoops as much as someone with a bum leg can. ""So if you don't like what I have to give, then spread the word, bronze one. Someone I'm sure is not nearly so particular."" And the pack-tail smelt sort of wriggles off-camera until the grandfather-a-dozen-times-over hobbles over to retrieve the lashing thing. ""Don't let the movement fool ye, these things have sweet meat under their skin."" He's tempted himself all of a sudden. 

Glowing Hands Havoc Brown Hatchling heavily topples from his shell, somersaulting through the loose sands and caking himself in grit and grime.  Blink.  While no initial whines of hunger are uttered from him, piteously does the hungry thing look onto the crowd. He smells food...but where is it? 

Unyielding Warrior Wolverine Bronze Hatchling catches that waggle of fish and seems to approve.  Fish.  Fresh.  Still looks like the animal it came off of, and not this... processed stuff that reeks of human hands and human knives.  And that guy holding it.  Looks like he's been around, too.  Might know a few things.  The bronze bulls his way forward, and begins clawing at Uiije's pant leg while he's at it.  He's the best at what he does, and don't you forget it! 

Unyielding Warrior Wolverine Bronze Hatchling's cries turn joyous, and he turns towards Uiije, creeling piteously. 

Unyielding Warrior Wolverine Bronze Hatchling looks at you with whirling eyes.  You have Impressed him. 

Rielle clucks her tongue toward the little green flapping her wings, shaking a bit of meat on her pack. ""Silly,"" she murmurs. ""I don't think you can fly yet.""  M'nty's nudging has distracted her from the green though, and she shrugs. ""Well... I think they're all beautiful. The bronze is rather funny in his personality, though, and that green is quite bold."" She gestures to the one trying to take flight. A chuckle is directed at the scolding Lasera, before she shrugs at M'nty again. ""House and home, hardly. They'll just keep me up for a few sevendays."" Noting the bronze's impression, Rielle claps and beams, calling out a congratulation. Oh yes, its all so wonderful. 

Gaia flips in from ::between:: just in time to see a green take off to perhaps go wild, och! Green glides down to settle on some unknowns shoulder. It's a humanpet. It's pink. *blink* Brown. Pink. She doesn't have the word for 'tan' so he just happens to be a pinkbrownpet. Head cocks to the side and she gives an inquiring chirple into the ear of her new fence post. What's happening, babe. Eggs hatchin', boids a flyin', who's out to impress her cousins. Huh huh huh? 

Kia leans in towards Shava to respond ""That's just Uiije I'm afraid. He's N'ano's father you know."" is mentioned with a certain bit of glee ""Eww Uiije leave it be for the time being"" the impression occurs and she claps ""Good for you, now you've another mouth to feed. I'm sure you two will get along famously."" stretching out on her towel she yawns a bit ""After this place clears out I think I'm going to take a nap."" Astet snatches another piece of meat from the wrapping hissing just to make sure Kia doesn't try to stop her. Those hatchlings are takin too long for her tastes. 

Shava smiles as the bronze tames the older man. ""Well, that tactic seemed to work, and rather well I would say, wouldn't you Kia?"" At the information of Uiije's history with the Weyr. ""Really now? That I didn't realize. He must be rather proud of N'ano, being Weyrleader and all, at least, one would think.""

Jubilee slowly lids her little eyes and falls blissfully asleep. The new green's stomach is slowly filled, the eating slowing as her eyes begin to whirl more calmly, curling up by her new humanpet and begins to lid. Ceran, however, is much to excited to calm down, in fact he just keeps getting more giggly as he gawks down at his prettiful little aquamarine girl. He's stumped. She needs a name! He finished his promise and got the prettiest pick.. but she  doesn't even have a NAME! Everyone should have a name! He picks her up to gently hold, ""Now. We gotta get you a name. It's a good think we've got a good harper at the Weyr.. Oooh, you don't know what a harper is do you? Well, you'll see. Some of them are nice.. but a lot aren't. They teach things though. It's how I learned my letters."" And his incredible grammar, ""They teach words too! And songs! I learned me a new word a couple days ago.. It's a growed-up word. You know, that's a good name for you. Crux. I means an insolf-insol/v/able  salo-salution. Big word, Crux! It's good though..."" 

Stunning and Magnetic Polaris Green Hatchling eyes... Shake shake shake? O.o;  Meat? Was that meat somewhere? For a moment her flaps are slowed and she ceases to try and take off, at least for a brief moment. 

Uiije tilts the back of his woven hat until it dangled precariously, and rather funnily, onto the back of his head. ""Whoa now! These things cost two marks I'll have you know!"" But, the One with Big Claws is given the struggling fish and hefalls, yes falls, onto his rear end with a light 'poof' of sand. No harm done  though, he's actually /laughing/. ""There. Now maybe you can get my poor excuse for pets moving. A prod or four with those talons should do it."" Ha, N'ano and pride in the same sentence? Well he is proud, but doesn't admit it.

M'nty shook his head, ""They can fly right after their wings dry off... like  vtols."" He chuckled, and gestured to the green she was talking about. ""She will, soon. If she carries on like that."" He picks up on some outside conversation, gathering that the old man over to one side was N'ano's father...  Huh, interesting. Not that he'd appreciate being called 'old man' M'nty was sure. ""Heh..."" He thought for a moment, ""There's that brown there... curious  creature, that one... what about him?"" M'nty then shook his head again, ""No...  no... You'll be eaten out of house and home... why don't you foist some off on those kidlets you take care of?"" He glanced at the speaking-out-loud Ceran and shook his head in amusement. 

Ceran calls to Crux, who flies over and lands on his shoulder. 

Kia can't help it she holds her stomach as she laughs now ""He may be proud of him I guess but you'd rarely ever realize it."" a snicker ""Sometimes he's rather loud not being happy about the way N'ano acts. At least that's how I read it. Could be completely off base but you never know."" Astet now takes matters into her own hands. Moving back towards them the gold drags some meet off the wrapping and closer to the hatchlings left. 

Rowress continues to tease and taunt the bronze hatchling with her rod. ""Oh nothing's gonna be able ta take the meat from this. Oh, nothing's gonna be able ta take the meat from this."" Yes, Ressy is singing to tease the bronze further. Of course, her own firelizards are watching eagerly, hoping that the meat will be left alone for them. 

Glowing Hands Havoc Brown Hatchling is forgotten? The little brown makes a small gutsy sound, pitter-pattering around within the sands, nibbling at crumbs left. 

Nogagon leans forward as the stunning green stops trying to take off. ""Yes,  that's the way."" he murmurs, not realising he is saying his encouragements out loud. ""Come on, yes. Meat. Tasty tasty. I'll bet you're starving."" he tosses another bit of meat towards the green, and it lands halfway between him and the green. Closer to the brown, though.

Treirluperak just keeps watching the people and hatchlings, rubbing his face for a moment, and then goes back to watching. 

Rielle continues shaking the meat a little. Yes, that's right, over here, you see it little one. ""I'd rather just foist off some kidlets,"" Rielle grins. ""Firelizards are much better companions, and they keep you warm at night,"" she says simply. ""And I don't mind, I've done quite well."" Sniff. Rielle is, indeed, quite proud of her little firelizards, and the way she cares for them shows it. Or so she hopes. Wiggle wiggle. Rielle keeps shaking that meat on her pack, hoping a 'lizard finds it suitable. Of course, she won't tell /M'nty/ that. 

Shava shrugs. ""Some parents, they never want to admit their feelings about something or someone, especially children, if they're the fathers. My mother is happy I made Journeywoman in a craft, while my father usually mutters about that I should have waited and gotten handfasted to a young man that can help around the cothold. But my mother always says that he's proud of me."" She shrugs, ""I just let him be and live my life that's all."" She then puts a hand down to lean on her arm, however, this hand also causes the bag of herdbeast  meat to be knocked away. ""Oh shardit,"" and gets up to get it. 

Stunning and Magnetic Polaris Green Hatchling is lured. Ooo. Shake shake. It wiggles! Colored her amused.  Quickly bouncing forward, Rielle's meat is tackled with a squeal of delight.  Feed me!  

Stunning and Magnetic Polaris Green Hatchling's cries turn joyous, and she turns towards Rielle, creeling piteously. 

Magen stands, brushing the sand from her backside. Smiling she whispers, 'Good  Luck' to those she leaves behind... 

Magen walks to the North Emerald Beach. 

Ceran beams down at his little snoozing green, having been just freshly dubbed her very own name. Care-ful-ly he cradles the tiny creature, looking about for his Nan and sister, grinning at them n teh crowd, offering food to the little mouths. He pauses, glancing side-long at the bag of meattrolls, some still left so he quietly brushes sand over it with his foot. It's treasure. Treasure when he has a hungry one to care for. He'll come back for it later. He peeks his head up and looks around for the one who had given him food earlier, and wanders amowly around the crowd before finding him, ""Hi!"" Calls out the brat, grinning from ear to ear, ""Look at her! She's pretty.. But shhhh she's sleepin'."" And then M'nty gets another, peering, glance, ""Are you a dragonrider?"" 

Glowing Hands Havoc Brown Hatchling's cries turn joyous, and he turns towards Nogagon, creeling piteously. 

Miaren pulls out the sandwich she had taken apart ealier, finishing off the roll, and the meatroll which follows. Jubilee partially wakes, which ends up with Mia feeding her half the meatroll. Jubilee's little eyes unlid and she yawns and then looks around for something to eat! 

Remy calls to Ororo, who flies over and lands on his shoulder. Remy calls to Candra, who flies over and lands on his shoulder. Remy picks up HATCHING RULES. Remy calls to Sekmeht, who flies over and lands on his shoulder. Remy calls to Scorpio, who flies over and lands on his shoulder. Remy calls to BellaDonna, who flies over and lands on his shoulder. Remy steps away for a moment to scrawl out a message to someone. 

M'nty sees right through Rielle's dissembling. ""Ahh... well, hopefully you won't be displeased if you hatch another one. And I guess it does serve me right for following Lasera out. ... here... He trailed off and then started laughing. ""And there she is..."" Death. Destruction. Mass Hilarity. Gasp. ""You are doin' quite well.."" He managed before breathing in slowly. Whew. Then he peers at Ceran. ""She is pretty... What did you end up naming her?"" He said in the voice that all adults use when talking to kids. ""And yeah.. I'm a 'rider.""  He pointed southwardsly down the beach. ""That way. Mino's right over there."" 

Apholone smiles softly as he watches the last firelizard of the clutch impress, he looks down at the Blue nestled in his arms and only has eyes for this little  one, his blue, and begins to ponder a name for his new friend. 

Nogagon blinks a little, as the brown chooses his meat. ""Hello there."" he says, picking up the firelizard with a somewhat dazed expression on his face. ""We have to find you a name.."" 

Rielle giggles at the little green's pounce, quickly tearing the rest of the strips into better, bitesized pieces to feed to the little one. Storm and the rest of her group immediately descend upon the nanny, their little eyes glittering as they peer at their new addition. All Rielle does is flash a bright smile to M'nty, and continues feeding the newborn flizard on her lap. ""Polaris,"" she murmurs softly, stroking the head of the newborn. 

Shava grabs it and looks up. ""Well, it seems all the hatchlings have Impressed."" She starts to call off about offering food, but then Tanis, her bronze comes up, chittering away for food. ""Well, you little sneak. Go off and leave me for a hatching and then come back and demand food. Oh alright,"" she gives in and gives hiim a few pieces of meat before denying him anymore. ""That's it. Well,"" looks back at Kia, ""I guess I should go find my ride and  head back to Ista before the day gets too far along."" 

Kia waves towards Shava ""It was nice talking to you. I think I'm going to engage in my nap now. I'll be back up at the Weyr later on tonight."" is said as she leans back onto her towel and cradles her head on her hands.  

Shava nods, ""You'll find me up in the Star Stones then most likely, if the skies remain clear enough. Bye Kia,"" she turns toward Ista Hold so she could catch her ride back. 

Shava walks to the South Emerald Beach. 

Ceran isn't a kid! He's a Weyrbrat! The brat peers back up to the affirmed 'rider, grinning as he pushes his arms out to show off his new li'l greenie, ""I named her Crux! Do you know what that means? I just learned what it means, a harper told me!"" He continues, not letting M'nty answer, ""It means, uh, a  in-insulvuable problem. ""Not tripping over his words too much, ""It's hard, but it's a good name!"" He says with a smug look, then falters, leeaaaaning out to  peer at the direction, ""Really? Can I see? Can i?"" 

M'nty nods at Rielle, his own face turning slightly more towards 'awwww' and less 'uggghh'. He gathered his own two into him before nodding. ""She's a true cutie... Really."" He then turns his attention to the kid. Excuse me... the Weyrbrat. ""Um... Crux. The insurmountable dilemma?"" He tilted his head to the side, then chuckled, ""I think you've got it, Ceran."" Then he follows the boy's look. ""Sure... That is, if your Nanna doesn't mind."" 

Ceran ohhhs quietly and nods, ""I like your words better."" then a pause and a furrow of his brow, ""You can remind me what you said again later.. ok?"" A pause as he peers back at his nanna and twin, then back up at the rider. Well.. he is a dragon rider.. so he's responsible and stuff. And Ceran /does/ live at a Weyr. That means he's supposed to go off and look at stranger dragons, ""Oh! Nanna doesn't mind. She likes dragons. I'm gonna be a rider too, one day, so I have to investigate, you know?"" He beams down at the little greenie, ""Her name is Crux. And it's a good name."" Just too bad he's not a buff at the meaning.. or explaining it to people anyways, ""My Nanna doesn't mind. She's with 'Rianna. 'Rianna's like me!"" 'Nuff said. 

Using his staff as a crutch of sorts, Uiije finds his feet and makes his way over to Finlen, his newest addition balancing on his shoulder. ""Ooo, those claws are wicked. Look what found me, Fin!"" The man turns and heartily offers congratulations. ""I'll put those diggers to good use, have no fear. So what do you say, shall you row us back to the hut? I want to grill up them fish we caught. See, uh, him, meanie, ferocity, uh.."" More adjectives here! ""Fierce,  yeah that works, Fierce here has the right idea."" Nevermind the fish viscera now covering the back of his chemise. His wife can get that stain out, no prob. 

Rielle chuckles at the weyrbrat, but only half-heartedly. She's a bit enthralled with her 'lizards at the moment, oh yes she is. Standing, all four bundle around her excitedly, as though a colorful cloud. Finally she manages to settle them, and they all take a variety of perches - her head, and shoulders, with Polaris in her arms. Smiling at Ceran, Rielle asks. ""Is that your first flitter?"""

5/25/03

Living Cavern
The smooth, rounded walls cavern sweep upward from an oval base, two dragonlengths long and one wide, large enough to seat every member of the Weyr at mealtimes.  The soft blackness of the lava which forms these caverns swallows glowlight, so shelves for glowbaskets abound, dotting the walls every three or four paces and casting gentle greenish light toward the sparkles of gold volcanic glass embedded in the ceiling.  Ancient, lustrous tables run along the axis of the cavern, and at the far end rests the raised dais and high table, where Weyrleaders and honored guests eat during formal occasions. Behind the high table, the Weyr's symbol is embedded into stone: a smoking mountain in black on... [look closer]
Perched near the food are twenty-seven firelizards.
You see Basket of Tubers here.
N'ano and Lyria are here.
Obvious exits:
Northeast Caverns     Kitchens     Bowl     Southern Caverns

""You ain' gonna go to those baths! I don' want you gettin' that wrap wet!"" N'ano insists, pressing his hand onto the table as he half stands while searching for something in his pocket. Finding a 1/16 mark, he flicks it towards the brownrider, ""There, will that get you to stay put? We'll get that young lad to do it for you, sound good?"" he grins but then frowns at the mention of Hyti, ""Uh--well,"" he pauses, rubbing at his neck and looking up just in time to see his father pass through the doors. And then he just stares at the man like a deer caught in headlights.

Darsey walks in from the South Caverns.

Uiije does the crab-walk shuffle, his good leg picking up slack for his bad one. Too proud to be seen with his cane, the man attempts to join his son. It'll be a while though. ""Nanoc, do get me some gruel and klah, will you?"" He's doing all he can to just make it to a chair. ""Did I bring my cushion.. No I didn't."" Since he's older, he can afford to talk to himself and not look like a loony. ""Mmm, something smells good. You can tell it's not your mother's cooking."" He winks and would elbow N'ano if he were anywhere close by. He's getting there...

""I know how to wrap an ankle. I can take it off and put it back on just fine."" So hrmph. Lyria catches the mark and tucks it in her pocket,""Maybe,"" shr grumbles and turns to stare at  the old man making his way into the caverns. ""Who is- Oh, is thatcher daddy, N'ano?"" she asks quietly and holds back a snicker. Better go get that gruel 'n klah, N'ano. 

""It's N'ano, dad,"" the Weyrleader corrects for the billionth time since the man first arrived at the Weyr. And since that man always did have authority over him, N'ano just gives a heaving sigh, standing hesitantly before reluctantly retrieving said gruel and klah for the older man. ""Eat it 'n weep,"" he comments as he deposits the food in front of Uiije, giving him a pat on the head as he nudges him closer to the chair nearby. ""Y'don' need a cushion. The chairs are just fine without 'em."" And his work is done. Returning to his seat promptly, N'ano regains his former posture, complete with one knee propped and chair leaning back. ""Yeah, that's 'em,"" he belatedly replies towards Lyria with a roll of his eyes.

Darsey stumbles into the caverns, hair tousled enough that it's apparent he either hasn't done anything since he slept on it, or else he just got tossed. In either case, he shuffles over to gather a plate of food and something to drink and shuffles over to join the others at their table, though little more than a polite nod is offered all around.  Sure, sure, he knows who they are, but nobody wants to be annoyed by their titles being crisply saluted this early.

Uiije is finally nearing a chair and when he gets there, he spends his time easing himself down into it. That done, he focuses back on N'ano. ""You'll always be Nanoc to me. And what's this crabbiness for? He doesn't get that from me, that's for sure."" He says in self-defense. ""And who do we have here?"" Lyria is then subject to the man's glance as he ushers in a charming smile. Now that's one thing N'ano inherited from his father. ""Hi there."" Is reserved for Darcy. 

Lyria simply grins at N'ano as she idly tries pointing her toes, then flexing her foot, and deciding that that's a bad idea for now. ""Me? Oh, I'm Lyria, brown Rilskiath's rider."" She points a thumb toward N'ano, ""And he made me sprain my ankle."" Just blame it all on the Weyrleader. Hah. The girl's evil and proud of it.

P'renn shakes his little boo-tay in from the Southeastern Bowl.

""Hey, y'should get 'em to give you that sponge bath,"" N'ano suggests towards Lyria with a wink, nudging a thumb towards Darsey as he does so, complete with a light laugh. And then argh, ""I ain' crabby. 'n this is Lyria, my wingsecond,"" he quickly introduces despite the fact she already did, giving said girl a wave over.  ""And that's--"" N'ano quirks a brow towards Darsey, beckoning an introduction from the boy before he snaps his head back towards the brownie, ""No I didn'! That was /all/ your fault. You're the clumsy one.""

It's just.. way too early to be here. The truth of the matter is P'renn left the barracks this morning in his pajamas, it was only after the first few giggles that he managed to groggily peek down and notice. And so, going back and slipping on appropriate wear and a knot and attempting to comb his hair, the weyrling now staggers into the caverns. ""Klah,"" is muttered faintly as the boy bumps into a table, corrects his direction, and shuffles for the alluring scent of liquid brewing.

Darsey's eyes raise to take in the...er...stunning sight of P'renn.  Okay, so Darsey really doesn't look impressed, rather, he offers Uiije a nod and a low, ""G'morning.""  Tousled hair is run through with Dars's fingers by way of a makeshift comb in the most awkward sentence ever typed on this MOO and the boy returns to his munching.  Really, it's so tempting to yell, 'look out for that ferret' but Darsey has manners, and the last thing he wants is a dead Weyrling on his conscience.  ""P'renn, this way,"" he offers, picking up a klah pot from the table and waving it slightly back and forth.  Dars may -look- like he just got up, but he's as alert as ever.

Uiije loads a spoonful of the lumpy porridge into his mouth and chews thoroughly. ""Lyria, mm? It's a pleasure m'dear."" He'd kiss her hand or some such, but he's been married for decades and that just wouldn't be right. He's too old for that sort of stuff. ""I'm Uiije, the sire of this lug-head."" But it's said in such a loving manner that you can tell he means no harm. Except maybe when he gets mad. ""You sprained the girl's ankle? Really son, that's no way to woo her over."" Oy. Did he teach you /nothing/? 

Lyria sends an eye over toward Darsey then shakes her head,""I can get to the baths just fine and rewrap my ankle."" So hrmph. A beaming smile is sent toward N'ano as she snaps her fingers in the weyrling's direction,""P'reeennn. P'renn can you get me a mug of juice? I can't. N'ano sprained my ankle."" Oh she will eventually stop telling people that, but it's so fun to do when N'ano's around.

""P'renn! Just the man I wanted to see--"" N'ano calls out, though gives Lyria a headtilt for her to take over from there since he's about to be preoccupied with something else for the time being. ""Lug-head? What!? I ain'---/what/!?"" Oy. Slumping into his chair, N'ano simply facepalms, ""I ain' wooin' no one. And I /didn'/ sprain her ankle! SHARDIT!"" What a potty mouth.

Uiije drowns whatever criticism he was about to say in a mouthful of klah, but he quickly redeems himself. ""Well there's no use in denying it. Lying's wrong. And don't swear,"" he thumps his hand against N'ano's bicep. ""You know your mother hates that."" Back to his breakfast.. ""So just what'd he do?"" Note he'll believe a stranger over his own flesh and blood. Poor Nanners.

P'renn stops and mumbles incoherently a moment, before half-lidded eyes turn in Darsey's direction and the boy shuffles over, slowly but surely. Shuffle shuffle. ""Whosit?"" Eyes are unsqueezed just a squinch in order to see Darsey with klah. As he continues the long slog over he suddenly catches the voice of Lyria and N'ano addressing, well, him. In a sudden panic-driven, sleep-deprived tail spin, the boy begins saluting all over the place. ""Yes Ma'am, sir? Juice?"" 

Can't you hear the plaintive whine in his voice? Juice is all the way back over theeeeere. Huff. Turning back around, klah is put on hold as the still saluting P'renn attempts to get.. alert. Juice is found, poured, and a glass is slowly scooped up as he heads back over. ""Sprained ankle? How'd you.. N'ano sprained your ankle?"" Well, this is enough to cause a stir of interest, at least enough to carry him to Lyria and company without bumping into anyone.

Lyria pouts at N'ano,""You mean you're /not/ wooing me?"" Snickersnicker. A chair near her is pushed out a bit and patted,""Have a seat, P'renn, dear."" Lyri accepts the juice as she nods her head to her ankle which is propped up on the next chair over. ""Slipped in some juice while I was getting N'ano a cookie."" Therefore it is N'ano's fault. ""How've you been, P'renn?"" she asks conversationally. ""Enjoying weyrlinghood? You been flying yet?""

""I'm /not/ lyin'! Sha--"" N'ano just stops, rolling his eyes while stuffing a cookie into his mouth. There's no sense in defending. It just doesn't work when his father's around... but well, one last attempt ""I /didn'/ sprain /her/ ankle. She spilled her mug--she slipped on it, end of story! And no, I ain'... you're a little young, don' you think?"" And that comment's probably a bad mistake, at least in front of those who know him best as of late.

P'renn plunks himself down in the offered seat with a little 'woof' of exhaustion. ""Oh, h'lo Lyria, that's quite the sprain there."" And the boy /leans/ in, nose an inch away from the rider's injury to allow eyes to focus. ""Me? Been pretty good, although, I think that I may not be getting enough sleep."" Master of the Obvious strikes again! ""Flying? Well, I've only gotten a few feet off the ground in formations, I was going to go higher the other day but that's when Dea came out of no where and gave me this."" The new knot is pointed too and sleepy eyes widen with something between pride and pure abject terror.

Uiije dabs at a spot of gruel that landed on the front of his shirt. ""Ugh, that's m'good one too."" Ah well. ""You should be more careful, doll. Next time, try to see if you can land on something softer."" Like... N'ano? ""So, where's Hytiaf? I've not seen 'er yet and well I want her to check my leg. I think I got a bone spur on my big toe. See.."" He attempts to illustrate his problem when he remembers they're at a dinner table. ""Oh. Well, I'll show ya later.""  

Lyria raises her eyebrows at N'ano with an amused smile,""Young, hm? Oh, I suppose so,"" she responds. Yeah. /She's/ a little young? Hah. ""Oh congratulaaations, P'renn."" She pats the weyrling on the head. ""Your weyrlinghood is just flyin' by. Been thinking about wings at all yet?"" she asks nonchalantly.

""Ugh--dad!"" N'ano exclaims, shaking his head before ducking it slightly, ""Oh--Hyti? She's--"" he shrugs, motioning towards the infirmary. ""working, I 'ppose."" But since Uiije apparently doesn't know yet, N'ano should at least pretend he knows where Hyti is, right? Grinning quickly, he quirks his head towards Lyria and P'renn, nodding accordingly, ""'cause you'll be graduatin' 'fore you know it!""

P'renn peers towards Lyria and N'ano with a tweaked brow, fingers idily traipsing across the table to snag Darsey's klah pot and fill a somewhat clean mug nearby. ""Oh, heh, thanks."" Blushy brow waggling ensues. ""Wings? No.."" He has a feeling a shameless plug is going to come out of this. Uiije, for his part, is given a curious once-over from behind the safty of the klah pot, so this is N'ano and Rh'yn's family. Mhm. Explains a lot.


Uiije digs back into his bowl of food. At least while he's eating, he's quiet. ""Where're all m' grand babies?"" He suddenly looks at N'ano as if he should perpetually have them clinging to him or something. ""I've only seen.. uh, one of 'em"" He can't remember the name, but can you really blame him? N'ano fathered so darn many. 

Well, not Rh'yn's family, but N'ano's, yes. Half brothers, don't ya know? ""Grandbabies? They ain' babies no more, y'know... but well--Ryran 'n Neana are with the harpers durin' the day, 'n I can't help if if you're already snoozin' by the time they come back, y'know... 'n Eymber's been with Tstar for the past sevenday 'n Nanli don' even live here 'n--"" he's lost count here. ""I think that's all I have so far..."" There could always be the occasional one that he doesn't know about, right? Perhaps.

Lyria nods to P'renn,""Yup. B'fore you know it."" Lyri sips slowly at her juice,""Well, maybe you should chat with Rh'yn about it or something."" Seeing as Rh'yn's already been brainwashed to Wavecutter.  ""I mean, there're lotsa wings out there and you'll want to make sure you get picked by one you like. Like Wavecutter. Cause...uh..."" A glance to N'ano. Cause why?

P'renn just sorta.. looks.. at N'ano. How many brats was that? Four? Something of incredulous respect seems to be oozing from the newly awakened brownrider as he smothers a chuckle into his mug. Lyria is given undivided attention just then as the shameless plug presents its self. ""Wavecutter? Hmm, any particular reason?"" Eyes also traverse to N'ano. Yes, do tell.

Uiije clamps down on the spoon indignantly. ""Well, the Healer told me I need my rest. I'm practically existing on just half of m'body anyway."" Don't bash the cripples. ""Well. I ain't seen my kids, nor my daughter-in-law. Just what're you trying to pull Nanoc? Don't tell me you're looking to be single again, because I don't think the Weyr could support you as a loose cannon."" 

""'cause we think you'd be a wonderful asset to the wing and--well, but uh--we wouldn't wanna make you join one you didn't want, but at least consider, eh? We think you're one of the best weyrlings out there--'n a natural born leader, obviously, so you'd make a wonderful rider to our collection."" Sweet talk is good, isn't it? N'ano thinks so, anyway. At least while he's talking rider business, he can ignore those little comments from his father, right? Ooh, but he's not getting out of this one. With a light blush and some more slumping, N'ano quietly replies, ""We ain' together no more, dad... Hyti and I broke up a few months ago..."" And N'ano should be quite thankful that Uiije doesn't have his cane right now.

Darsey has disconnected.

Lyria goes home.

P'renn fluffs up in an important haze of fluffity puffity ego joy. Natural born leader? Best weyrlings he's ever seen? Preeeeeen. ""Wavecutters, well, I will certainly think about it. You have my word."" Klah is sipped as the boy watches Lyria hop up and hobble towards the infirmary.

Uiije can still wield a spoon pretty well.. ""WHAT?"" The one time where he wasn't hard of hearing. ""You mean you're not together at all? How could you?!"" That spoon is flailing now, better get out of the way! ""Well you march your little hind-end straight up to her office and apologize and get her back. She was such a keeper too."" He sighs then remembers he's angry and glares at his son. He's writing you outta the will for sure. 

N'ano ducks his head, shielding the flying spoon with his arm ""I've tried! We were gonna get back together, but it was on the condition that I'd practically be leashed like a canine! I need my freedom, y'know..."" Moreso from his father, at the moment. And to change the subject, N'ano gives a hopeless look towards P'renn, nodding his head quickly, ""Good good--good.""

P'renn scooches his chair a few places away from the Weyrleader, so as not to be the victim of any flailing silverware. Nano's look is noted and returned with a helpless sort of shrug as the boy attempts to provide some sort of relief for father and son. ""Err.. Sir? I don't believe we've met, I'm P'renn."" And a hand hesitantly extends towards Uiije. Please, do not bite.

Uiije grits whatever's left of his teeth. ""I think it's about time you got shackled a little bit. I'm sure all she wanted was a little more time with you. Now that you're the head of this here place, I'm sure she only saw you when it was for your convenience."" He can chew N'ano a new orifice because he's daddy-o. ""P'renn?"" He's gotta repeat things to make sure he hears correctly. ""Do me a favor and please don't turn out like him."" A long finger is pointed to the bronzerider. ""Wherry dung, this is."" He's winding down, but that may just be the eye of the storm. ""Does your mother know?""

""Eh--uh, I haven't told her yet, no,"" N'ano winces, rubbing vigorously at his neck. ""It wasn't that, dad..."" And though that was said, he's not going to admit the real reason for the breakup. ""Can we--please talk about somethin' else, /please/?"" Aww, little N'anny's getting uncomfortable. ""'n my love life has nothin' to do with my work.""

P'renn retracts his hand quietly, before peeking over at N'ano with something between sobering disbelief and budding amusement. He's never heard anyone talk to the Weyrleader like this, I mean, come now, he's the head honcho. But apparently, dads are the exception, so it'd be best for all if he just played 'casual observer' for the morning. 

Uiije puts his spoon back to it's original use and uses the tepid oatmeal as an excuse not to talk. ""Well you tell her or I will. And you know she's going to box your ears. Though I'd prolly help 'er if I could use both my arms."" His flaccid right one is lifted slightly off the table before it's lowered again. ""You better hope your brother don't come out like you either. Faranth forbid."" Maybe Rh'yn won't be corrupted.

""I'll tell her, shards,"" N'ano grumps, furrowing his brows and crossing his arms like a four turn old that just go sent to the corner for time out. ""Things don' last forever--ain' like you stayed with my real ma for a long time!"" Retaliation! N'ano shall succeed! Too bad N'ano doesn't know the real truth behind Uiije's former situation. 

P'renn goes home.

Uiije could throw this bowl if he trusted his aim to not hit anyone. ""That's no excuse for tunin' the tables,"" even though he'd most likely do it in a heartbeat. ""She had her reasons I guess, but that's water under the bridge now."" There's no way he's telling the truth to save face either. ""And I always thought you were the good son."" He exaggerates with a sniff. ""But, I may just forgive you if you gimme a refill?"" He shimmies his klah mug enticingly.

""That's actually what I'm doin' right now, though. Just kinda coastin' 'long, spending more time with the kids. I'm even gonna take a few trips to Keroon to see Nanli--I honestly haven't seen her since she was well... a babe."" Child neglecter. ""Ooh, I almost forgot, Sapha said hi--she's been up in her weyr for a long while 'cause of that pregnancy.""

Uiije notices a hair in his cup and pulls out a slender strand of black hair. Surely not his. ""Ew."" A shake of the hand is given. ""That'a boy, son. Maybe you'll be on the right track as my 'good son' again."" Ha, make no promises. ""Oh, tell her I said hi and that us invalids will have to sit in the shade and talk sometime."" He likes talking. Especially about N'ano. ""I'm gonna go take this outside and git myself a tan. You can come if you want, you need a little color yourself, boy."" He pinches N'ano's cheek and beings the looooong, laborious strut to the exit."

5/5/08

Southeastern Bowl
 This area of the bowl is the highest point of the bowl floor; from here, it slopes down and to the northwest, spilling out to the plateau below the wide gap in the Weyr rim to the west. Various tunnels here lead into the Weyr's inner caverns; the living caverns, hatching grounds, and main Weyr tunnel all branch off from here. To the west lie the stables where the Weyr's runners are housed. There is also a stone stairway that leads up to the Weyrleader's weyrs.
  It is an autumn midmorning.  
Perched on rocky crags about the bowl are two firelizards.
Green Hiakith, bronze Kirczykath, brown Derwyth, and brown Sidaaeth are here.
Jakina is here.
Obvious exits:
Ground Weyrs     Hatching Cavern     Central Bowl     Stables     Weyr Tunnel     Living Caverns

Sidaaeth drops down smoothly, his brown wings holding the air beneath and letting it escape slowly. Large feet tap the ground as the brown lands, settling himself down easily. He remains standing, even turning his head back over one shoulder to check on his hungover rider. Coora remains in place as well, clearly having a mental conversation with her lifemate. >> No, we didn't /do/ anything, Sida, and it's none of your business. Leave it alone. << So, she's a little cranky about the gay Smith who is her best friend this morning. With that final statement, she begins unbuckling, intent on dismounting whether the brown is going to help or not. Sidaaeth heaves a mental sigh before crouching to assist his rider's dismount. On the ground, Coora grimaces, blinks, blinks again and then smiles brightly, as though being her normal self will make her hangover go away. ""Thank you, Sida,"" She says aloud in a sweet voice.

Jakina ducks out of the lower caverns with a bundle of cloth held in the crook of her left arm. Her right hand rests on top of it as if the young woman wants to keep the bundle from falling or fly away. A good thing too, as there are dragons landing and kicking up winds and dust nearby. She gives a glance around, almost furtively, then starts moving in the direction of the beach.

There's a man-made dent in the rock where B'ane is seated, a brand of bench that is still cast in shadow and will remain so until late in the afternoon. Leather straps flood out of his hands where he rubs a stick of wax down their top length. He witnesses the brown's advent and by custom tries to name him. A bronze firelizard, having exhausted the early mild entertainment, checks crevices for invertebrates.

Coora gives the brown's side a gentle pat, despite her snappiness, ""I'll see you in a bit, then, Sida? Have fun on the beach."" The brown rumbles lightly, waiting for Coora to step away so that he can take off again. Oh, how easy life is after those initial flying lessons. Coora's wafted in a flood of sand and dust, evidence of Sidaaeth's own annoyance that he didn't wait patiently for her to get completely out of the range of dust before taking off. The woman frowns, pursing her lips as she checks over her shoulder at her lifemate with a tart, >> Thanks a lot. << Still, she's determined not to let a hangover get the best of her and since B'ane is the first person she sees, she heads over to the elder rider with a cheerful smile and aching head. ""Good morning, B'ane. How are you today?""

Some of all that dust and sand manages to make its way over to Jakina as well and she stops in her tracks to raise an arm to shield her eyes from the onslaught. ""Blast it!"" she exclaims, coughing as she somehow manages to swallow some of that dust. She gives a glance around, fixing her eyes on the woman who had just dismounted from the offending dragon. ""Did he do that on purpose?""

B'ane does admit it's Sidaaeth, after all, he was an Assistant Weyrlingmaster. Attentively, wax is pressed into some of the smaller creases with a thumbnail. Coora's opening gambit causes him to really pause to build an honest answer. ""A little groggy,"" leaving out the details of a headache. ""You land a Wing yet?"" Making an effort to peer at the brownrider's shoulder and soon, Jakina.

Coora glances over at Jakina, shrugging her thin shoulders. ""Yeah."" She pauses, pursing her lips in a frown. ""We argued,"" she adds, as though some explanation is needed. Technically, argued isn't the right word. Coora, in her hungover moodiness, didn't like Sidaaeth's constant badgering about and dislike of Laeri. It dawns on Coora that she's been just watching Jakina for several moments, thinking, and she suddenly smiles brightly, clearly a faked smile, and adds, ""I'm sorry about that. He didn't mean to, really,"" in a very sunny, also faked, tone. Had she not been hung over and grumpy, it would sound pretty close to her norm of excessive happiness, but today, it's clearly not. Turning back to B'ane, she waves at his bench. ""Can I? Not yet, we /just/ graduated. Do they usually tap /at/ the party?""

Jakina gives a look past Coora to B'ane and nods quietly at him, identifying him easily enough as a rider despite the lack of knot on his shoulder. As the other rider speaks, she turns her attention to the woman and gives a light shrug, a hand moving down to her thighs to brush away dust. ""S'pose they have a mind of their own, huh?"" she says and gives a look in the direction that Sidaaeth has gone. Down to the beach. So much for that plan. Whatever her plan was. She can't help overhearing the conversation between the other two. ""So you're one those who just graduated?""

B'ane loops the golden-brown straps through his palms to provide room for Coora. ""Occasionally. But only if the weyrling pair show gads of promise."" Dark eyes dance. ""What you got there? If it's edible, I'd keep it guarded..."" Corsair, B'ane first firelizard, doesn't appear to be having supreme luck with rounding up rock mites. 

Coora slides in next to the assistant weyrlingmaster, leaning back against the rock face with a deep sigh. ""I could use something to eat. And another cup of wine to get rid of this headache."" That's the best cure, right? Follow up your alcohol with more? ""Yeah, we graduated and partied way too much afterwards. Did you go to the party?"" Coora crosses her legs, tilting her head against one shoulder as she eyes the approaching woman. ""Well, I've no idea which wing will want me and Sidaaeth, or even which wing I /want/ to want us.""

Jakina freezes for just a moment as B'ane addresses her, then puts her hand on top of the bundle again, picking at the cloth. ""Just a towel,"" she says and turns a little to show that the white cloth certainly looks like terrycloth. She shifts on her feet, eyes moving from one rider to the other, looking like she'd rather be somewhere else. She gives a shake of her head to Coora and glances briefly to the cavern's entrance. ""I was.. Busy.""

B'ane scents the sour smell Coora exudes, it's an aroma as indicative of a Weyr as firestone. ""Food and drink - water - would be a good idea. If you want a draught, see D'noss or Raihu, but just remember to gird your tongue."" They taste like paste. ""Why /shouldn't/ a Wing want you?"" Corsair is now restricted to the background, following the wall of rock for certain occupied niches. ""I caught the end,"" hot on the heels of Jakina's remark.

Coora must be leaking alcohol from her pores, despite cleaning herself up and dressing in a nice blouse and breezy long skirt with enough folds to let her get her legs around her dragon's neckridges. She stands, nodding at B'ane. ""Yeah, I should eat. You want to come?"" She offers to the elder rider, dusting off the backside of her skirt. ""I didn't say they /wouldn't/ but that I don't know /which/ will."" She giggles at B'ane's words, grinning at Jakina before turning back to poke a finger at the bronzerider's shoulder. ""Ooooh, but you caught enough of it, didn't you,"" Coora questions flirtily.

""Well, I oughta..."" Jakina starts, glancing again from one rider to the other, both of them outranking her anyway. She gives a courteous nod, then turns and starts across the bowl, heading toward the beach again, then stops and turns back. ""Um, it'll be alright going out to the water what with the dragon alone out there, right?"" she asks the newly graduated rider, her hands holding onto the towel as if it's some precious thing that might break if dropped on the ground.

B'ane examines the work he's completed thus far of weather-proofing a portion of Aboleoth's riding straps. ""I could stand to have a little something,"" often skipping breakfast for an early lunch. ""Enough to try to find as many weyrlings as I could to provide personal congratulations. Which reminds me,"" scratching the point of his chin effectively, ""you weren't one of them."" A single, deep nod for Jakina, ""take it easy.""

Coora waves a dismissive hand towards the beach. ""Nah, Sidaaeth is asleep, I checked a few minutes ago, he passed right out in the middle of the beach. You'll be fine."" Coora smiles, shaking her head in amusement at the ways of dragons. ""As if he didn't just sleep all night."" She hovers beside B'ane, waiting for the other rider to get up, ""Oh, you can congratulate me after dinner and we'll continue the party,"" Now that she's gotten flirty, she's not going to stop, even if it is just harmless flirting. Suddenly, Coora frowns and turns back to Jakina. ""Hey, that's not a towel. What /do/ you have?"" Duh, hungover riders are not the fastest people to notice that towel has gotten a lot of careful attention. 

B'ane tucks the remainder of wax into a sheet of thin parchment, herding the quantity of straps onto his right shoulder. The tentative smile to Coora thins when she calls out the Weyr resident. ""That's got to be a priceless towel."" Not for a second convinced, but considering Sidaaeth's rider to be capable. ""I'll tack this back in my weyr and be right back."" He considers the young women courteously, but tersely as he takes large steps towards where he last saw his bronze.

Jakina gives a nod to Coora, looking relieved that no young and potentially reckless dragons will be sharing the beach with her. About to turn and head to the beach again, she stops as Coora continues, claiming that her towel, is not a towel. ""No, it's just a towel,"" she says, her hands working quickly to unfurl it. She holds it up with one hand in such a way that her other hand is hidden behind the white piece of cloth. ""I was going for a swim, but with dragons using the beach without their riders around, that can be a bit dangerous.""

[IstaWeyr] Coora: Dude. Laeri. Coora should start dating old men (like B'ane). Since she's so emotionally messed up and insecure. :)
[IstaWeyr] B'ane's ego goes -1.
[IstaWeyr] Coora: Hahaha. Eh, B'ane is just an example. I don't necessarily want /him/. (does that help your ego???) But just some random older rider.
[IstaWeyr] B'ane drops to -2."

3/26/08

Ground Weyrs
Dark stone arches upwards to vault high above the entrance to these ground-level weyrs.  Large enough for more than a few dragons, pillars define the expanse of one smooth dragon-couch from the next, to offer at least the hint of privacy.  Redolent, the air struggles towards the vents high above in an attempt to escape the prevalent odors of redwort and numbweed that drift and lurk in every tidy corner.  Tunnels branch off like tentacles, heading into dragon-healer's quarters and the infirmary further southeast.
Lzi is here.
Obvious exits:
Weyr 1     Weyr 2     Bowl     Infirmary     Rooms

The ground level weyr is dim with little noise infiltrating the Infirmary annex. B'ane is face down in the small bed, all limbs spread except for a left hand curled under his chin. Aboleoth makes a living barrier of the open entrance to the Bowl where light and trespassers each are screened out. The rider's brown firelizard doubles the number of sentries as he finds purchase on the dragon's spine.

""I didn't realize you were homeless,"" comes Lzi's soft and seductive voice as she exits the infirmary. She appears healthy enough, so it's hard to say why she was in the infirmary in the first place. The greenrider takes in the surroundings with a careful, and sarcastic, eye, nodding. ""I'd say it fits you."" Then, the petite woman comes to face B'ane, a smirk pulling at her face as she just stares him down in a way that only she can do.

B'ane murmurs something that doesn't reach a translation. His head lifts, an experiment to see if the pain is still there. ""Is there some water on that table?"" His baritone rasps, but the man doesn't clear his throat. Eyes still closed, B'ane rotates onto a hip. Outside, Aboleoth's body shifts and a very low rumble reacts to Lzi's invasion.

Lzi's face falls at B'ane's seemingly rude reaction to her entrance. Perhaps one with cheering and clapping and compliments abound would have done better for the greenrider. Regardless, she finds the glass of water he's searching for and carries it over to where he's currently at. Piercing brown eyes then stare down at the bronzerider as if trying to glare the truth out of him. ""What's the matter with you?""

B'ane pulls back only enough of his eyelids to leave a razor thin gap with which to see. It takes some time for his hand to close around the cup. ""Thanks."" There's private gladness that it's room temperature. ""I,"" after two sips the water is placed the short distance to the floor. ""It's a headache."" The ones from his old eye injury he gets that can fell a bronzerider. B'ane's head sinks back into the pad of his right arm.

""Must be a pretty bad headache,"" Lzi observes oh-so-smartly as she invites herself to sit on the edge of bed. She's small, so it's not like she's putting B'ane out by doing so. Softly, testing, a hand comes to rub the bronzerider's back. ""If you've got that bad of a headache, why are you out here and not in the infirmary where you should be? Or better yet, up in your weyr, comfortable in your own bed?""

B'ane scrunches his face when an irritating flood of dull pain spreads out into his forehead. ""It's too bright in there, but this way they could easily give me a half dosage of fellis."" He pants, ""willow salic... won't touch this."" A long leg carefully bends without directly ramming the woman. ""Don't get too close,"" his voice painfully slow, but meant to be funny. ""I vomited not too long ago.""

""Honey,"" and here Lzi's voice carries a tone that B'ane was surely familiar with on a daily basis before he left, ""I've been peed on, pooped on, and vomited on too many times to count."" Which means that the greenrider isn't about to leave him in the shape he's in. The hand on his back keeps rubbing as she leans to try and catch a glimpse of his face to see how he's doing. ""Is there anything else I can do for you? I won't be offended if you do want me to leave, you know.""

B'ane burrows his head into the angle of his elbow to try to smother or squeeze the throbbing straight out of his skull. A humming sound is made and the man changes the pitch of it to indicate a negative answer. ""I think,"" his fingers clutching the bottom of his tunic tight enough to make it cry out, ""I just need to rest a while."" 

Sensing that her presence around the bronzerider is neither necessary or wanted, Lzi stands then, careful not to jar him. ""Well, whenever you are feeling better, come and find me. We have a lot to talk about."" Ominous, for sure. However, the greenrider counters it by leaning down and placing a kiss on B'ane's head. ""Feel better, baby.""

B'ane doesn't commit to another exercise of opening his eyes, but his fingers reach out to feel whatever part of Lzi or her clothing that brushes by them after she pulls away.

That stops Lzi in her tracks, if only because his hand just so happens to graze the part of her body where her legs meet her behind, getting a sly smile out of the greenrider. Then, she kneels at the front of the bed where B'ane's head is at. ""I've heard from the aunties that you've been back, and yet you didn't stop by to see me. I know it's not exactly fair to have this conversation when you aren't feeling well and don't want to talk, but...I guess I just thought the kids and I would be first on your list of people to see, that's all. I was, and still am, hurt.""

Aboleoth deals in movement again and a sliver of Istan sunlight spears the far wall until the bronze realizes his error. ""I saw Lannin,"" B'ane commits in the gaunt voice of an old man. At least sick he can get away with stubborn silence - if in fact that's what it is. 

Accepting that, Lzi licks her lips and presses on. ""Look, I'm not going to sit here and lie to you, but I also don't want to add to your headache."" Because what she has to tell him would certainly create a headache of it's own. ""I don't know how you feel about me now, if you even feel anything toward me anymore, but...if you'll have me, I'd love to come to your weyr for the night whenever you are feeling better."" A welcome home, of sorts.

B'ane again emulates speech with static stress while he rocks his torso for some better comfort. ""... in... then I could... see."" Aboleoth now has much of his head into the door frame, but is hampered from entering further by his head knobs.

Now, feeling bad for pressing the issue, Lzi stands up and attempts to place a kiss directly on B'ane's lips. If he denies her, or if he's positioned in such a way that she can't get to his lips, the kiss is then placed on his cheek. ""When you are feeling better, come find me and we'll catch up, okay? For now, you need to rest. If you need anything, /anything/, please have Aboleoth tell Izlasth, and I'll be here as soon as I can, okay?""

...but that doesn't stop Aboleoth from trying to force his skull through the narrow opening, hampered such as he is by the forward placement of one of his forelegs. B'ane smiles, tiredly, after Lzi's scent leaves his nostrils. ""Aye."" The bed isn't so obliging for those long in body so his feet, once he rolls back to his stomach, cast off the edge.

With a longing final look to the ailing bronzerider, Lzi turns and leaves, but not before paying her respects to Aboleoth. Then, she's off to go back to her children."

Infirmary
This natural, bubble-shaped cave shows signs of recent renovations, the walls freshly painted, with new fittings. Cupboards cover one wall of the large cave, one marked prominently with a black skull and crossbones and bolted with a heavy lock. A stone bench, covered in a padded sheet, rests in the center of the room directly under a glass glowbasket; this area is the examining table. Racks, draped carefully with sterile cloths, surround the bench. Another bench against the back wall contains a sink, a water heater, and research equipment, including a white cloth draped over what must be a microscope. Three beds line the wall opposite the cupboards, curtains on tracks prepared to be drawn around them. The room smells faintly of redwort and numbweed.
On top of the cupboards are two firelizards.
You see Candidate Physical Board and Jamie here.
You notice Zian asleep here.
Talim and D'baji are here.
Obvious exits:
Ground Weyrs     Caverns     Crafters'Area     Rooms

The last bit of the attendant healer's laughter (at his own joke about the strangeness of finding D'baji in the infirmary without a bleeding Bajiren in need of stitches) dies down as the woman focuses on measuring out a dose of that gooey red stuff for the burly Weyrleader. Deb himself is seated idly on a cot, making tiny adjustments of his feet to try and get them perfectly symmetrical while framing a scratch on the floor from Faranth-knows-what. ""Yeah, he's been doin' a'right recently,"" D'baji offers idly when that woman comes back his way with the stuff.

Alive with firelizards, B'ane sojourns into the Infirmary with shoulders stooped from the combined effects of Electra, Corsair, and Nemesis. His thick-soled sandals are soft on the floor swept clean of grit. Connected to the aid first, ""is that one, can I take that?"" A small pennant of orange among grey makes B'ane see past the woman and to the Weyrleader. ""Baji!"" Not so much a yell as a strong voice to attract his clutch brother's eyes.

Some smart remark, the type all healers make when rushed for the contraceptive, about how it's possible there be so many kidlets running around when all the riders are breaking down doors for this stuff, is uttered, and she's out to get some for the newly arrived bronzerider. Baji, for his part, turns away from the duty of pre-emptively grimacing at the stuff in anticipation of its taste, and to B'ane, expression working into a quick smile. ""Hey. Heard y'were back."" As the Weyrleader is bound to.

""Easy,"" B'ane discloses to his mobile bronze firelizard who forgets how thin his caretaker's clothing now is. ""Can I get about three dosages? Thank you."" Knowing he's pushing the contraceptive's shelf life. Tucking his shoulder in while bypassing the Infirmary aid, he nears D'baji's cot. ""Not long, just a short run, I'll be off by noon or abouts."" His baritone sinks in decibels for the healer jibes. ""Don't they know this isn't always effective?"" 

D'baji lifts those broad shoulders in a shrug, turning back to look at the contraceptive, now B'ane's nearer, and, of course, glaring daggers at it. ""Not convince t'come back for long yet, eh?"" At this point, the man tilts his head back, downs the goo, and offers only a little shiver for the bitterness of it. That little cup is turned between thumb and forefinger, now. ""Y'know, Baji gave Saji that little blue dragon pully thing, not long ago."" Mused, more than anything. Random. ""Dontcha miss your kids an' all?""

B'ane starts out as grooming and ends with pulling on his left ear cartilage. ""Aye. But you know how it's always been, it's the Weyr that really raises the children."" He is either not completely self-convinced or not a true fan of collectively raising young. Peace-making, ""I won't be down south forever."" It'll just be somewhere else. ""So how many eggs do you think Ryasuzith will end yield?""

""Ain't the Weyr raisin' mine,"" D'baji notes with a snort. Closely followed by a slight forward slumping of his shoulders, and the admission of, ""A'right, so the nannies help an' all, but... Doin' it more proper'n a lot of people."" Hold habits die hard, and all that. ""Rya... Dunno. Was a good flight. Longer'n the last, I think... I'd say bigger'n last clutch we had - Lanti's last, y'know."" A pause, head turns to the side, and he adds, ""Good job Iq won't lay eggs, eh? Imagine a bunch of those runnin' 'round. Anyway, y'got time, we should do somethin'. Wash our dragons or somethin'. Maybe th'kids can play. I dunno."" And now, the Weyrleader gets to his feet, setting the empty cup on a short table for the aid, on her way back with B'ane's doses. 

B'ane guides a firelizard wing spar out of his hairline. ""Right, yeah,"" an airy chuckle accompanies the prospect of Iqiazath breeding, still uneasy about the Sin between them. ""I'll try to catch you before I go then."" B'ane seems committed. ""Ah, perfect."" Now equipped with a few week's worth of red liquid.

D'baji gives his brother-in-eggshards a quick dip of his head. ""Sounds good. Take care of yourself anyway, eh? I'll see y'later."" And the Weyrleader is turned, and out to the bowl."

Waterfall's Basin
The Weyr's freshwater pool flows clean and clear, almost undisturbed by the river that rests here after crashing down from the heights above. This small bay is neatly surrounded by a series of smooth stone steps and hidden beaches, a haven from the wider lake beyond before the water drops further to the sea below.
One gnarled, ancient tree has survived the ravages of time and Thread, reaching up towards the cliff above and the water below. A set of crude boards makes the climb an easy one. The wide, warm beach stretches to lap at the pool's edge, within earshot of the distant waterfall.
  It is a spring evening.  
Gliding above are four firelizards.
Brown Jhakkarath, gold Dedanseth, and bronze Aboleoth are here.
Lanti is here.
Obvious exits:
Branch     Forest Path

By his own nature Aboleoth disdains pockets of water, but the bronze's forelegs are past their wrists in his pursuit of fresh drinking water - a luxury not found on tundra. A hawkish muzzle is buried deep, his throat latch expanding and collapsing with each greedy swallow. B'ane is fresh off the dragon's back and remembering how to cope with such little clothing the average Istan well tolerates.

Dedanseth is about as deep into the pool as she can get, stretched out and lounging near the waterfall. Now and then, she reaches out to let the falling water splash over her head, while her tail curls lazily back and forth through the water. Lanti is about midway down the gold's back, a long handled scrub brush in hand. This, she works steadily along the metallic hide, washed nearly white in the moonlight. Eventually, both members of the pair turn towards B'ane and Aboleoth. Lanti waves, Dedanseth sends a welcoming thrill.

Aboleoth's eye facets chase each other quickly from the heady weight of water in his gullet. Ice's texture makes its delivery in time-consuming crunches. The bronze was cognizant of the gold from the onset of arriving when the power of thirst was more powerful than the design to greet. Now his head lifts, sharp muzzle clearing the water and a runoff point for scores of droplets. A basso tremor hums to Dedanseth. B'ane receives Lanti not at first, waiting for the right juncture of eye contact. His wave obviously needs practice.

Lanti tosses the brush spear-like into the water and takes a shallow dive from Dedanseth's back.  On her way back to shore, she retrieves the item before feet hit sand.  Then it's just a matter of slogging through the water and sand, though she stops a couple yards short of dry land.  ""Long time no see,"" she says to B'ane with a grin before tossing the brush onto the sand.  Behind her, Dedanseth has tucked her wings as close to her body as possible and has rolled over onto her back, floating a moment before going upright again.  Such a waterbaby.

Aboleoth deposits less of his muzzle back into the water now that the need for hydration is less desperate. His longtime rider himself is much unchanged, thinner by a sliver, as is Aboleoth: lean, the frame of a dragon who doesn't hunt penned stock. ""I didn't know a few sevendays constituted a long time,"" slick baritone identical. A modest smile is put into a parentheses of lines. But in fairness it's been a while since seeing Lanti this close and not afar. ""I don't think I would have recognized you.""

""If flying in, reporting, and flying out again counts, we're both downright socialites,"" Lanti replies with a wider smile.  She wrings some water out of her hair and fixes Aboleoth with a studious look before turning back to B'ane.  ""Miss the Weyr yet?""

B'ane's smile relaxes, but the lines around his lips remain defined. His head bobs at least twice. ""Some things."" Linen, the composition of his tunic, is examined like a new layer of skin. ""How long have you been off the sands for? Rather, what has your occupation been like?"" With Interval-slash-sporadic-filaments-of-Threadfall, the former Weyrleader asks with genuine interest.

""Um... a little over a Turn now,"" Lanti answers after a brief frown.  ""And Ryazusith just flew, so there will be eggs again in a while.  Dedanseth are I are back to the diplomacy trips.  It's...""  She trails off, then shrugs with a lopsided smile.  ""Busy.  How have you and Aboleoth been faring?""

B'ane's expression shows recognition of D'baji's and Minka's affirmations as Weyrleaders. ""Sin made the trip down and tried to fill me in,"" earful, same difference. ""Right about, yeah, it was right close to Ryazusith's flight. Iqiazath herself was in season and well, Aboleoth was the only male around as you can imagine."" The bronze in question has removed himself from the water and, facing the queen, curled to a crescent against Ista's black rock that still shares some sunwarmth.

""Lucky timing then,"" Lanti says, barely suppressing a laugh.  ""I mean... I'm glad.  I wish a lot of times that Sin had an easier road with that whole situation.""  'Reaches solidarity right there.  Lanti crosses her arms and glances back at Dedanseth, who has ducked her head under water beneath the waterfall.  Just playing.  Quietly.  ""I mean, what are the odds that her weyrmate's dragon would be monogamous?""

B'ane is there to watch his life mate settle his head on an uneven bed of crossed paws. ""While I think that Iqiazath and my dragon have a good rapport with one another, I couldn't imagine they'd be as you say, monogamous like Nverath and Ryazusith. It's strange in the world of dragons."" But then Bydelth similarly put the kink in his relationship with Lzi. ""Sin, she isn't so bad."" A pebble, with no marks of significance, is plucked from the ground and made to skip along the smoother dimensions of the basin.

""Sin is one of the few people I can count on for real conversation every time I talk to her,"" Lanti adds as B'ane sends the pebble flying.  She hooks her thumbs in the pockets of her cut-off shorts.  ""Says what she thinks, not what I think.  It's... refreshing.""  There's a small downturn of tone at the last word, but Lanti's expression is still pleasant.  ""So.  What brings you to Ista this time?  Tired of the constant freeze?""

B'ane's stone only succeeds in winning two solid skips before it drowns. ""Very,"" acquiescing, ""she is among the people I hold in high esteem for that very trait of blunt honesty. It's no slight to D'baji nor Minka, but Sin leading a Weyr would soon shake the dust off it."" He samples an amount of the warm evening air, chest cavity filling out. ""I ran out of charcoal, needed to replentish some fuel, and came to see my sons. I only saw Lannin briefly."" A second stone is gained, this one flatter. ""What about, what do you do to fill the void?"" Ubiquitous. 

Lanti watches the various waves and rings on the pool's surface.  ""Void?"" she asks, still staring at the water a moment longer before glancing at B'ane.  She remembers to add a smile before saying, ""Are you implying something?""  Under the waterfall, Dedanseth finally rises, her head hitting the cascade for a long moment before she begins making her slow way towards shore.

B'ane's fingers released the stone too early and this one flops once, rebounds uneasily, and sinks. ""I mean when you're not negociating agendas and reduced to the hatching grounds, what do you fill your time with?"" Efficiently the man reads the skies, the first pin-pricks of certain stars, for an indication of time.

""/Reduced/?"" Lanti asks B'ane, laughing this time.  ""Well now.""  Dedanseth sends a quiet croon to those on short as she steps past her lifemate and onto the sand, large, golden claws digging in, relishing the cool beneath the warm upper layer.  Lanti smiles at her for a couple seconds, then glances at B'ane.  ""I still surf, when the waves are good.  Run when it's not.""  That might be a joke.  Hard to tell.

B'ane measures the appearance of dragonflesh when it steals close by. ""She's a sight of health. I've known a good portion of goldriders,"" and their complaints. ""Trust me, I don't slander your position,"" his grin, without teeth, means no offense. Lanti's description of hobbies assessed, the single nod is jerky. ""Good enough."" His arms are woven into a fold across his chest. ""Night's getting thick. If we part, let it be good, nheh?""

Lanti bows her head slightly, still grinning.  ""I'm glad my pastimes meet your approval, B'ane, rider of Aboleoth,"" she teases lightly.  ""Have a good night,"" she adds a couple seconds later, not quite laughing.  ""I'd better take my non-reduced self back to the weyr before dawn greets us with the whines of a few good holders.  Stay warm, all right?""  Dedanseth adds a less joking farewell to the bronze before she follows her lifemate down the path towards the bowl."

[WickedCool] Sin: So, B'ane.  Ryazusith is goin' up this afternoon, I think, and Nverath is gonna be all catchycatchy.

[WickedCool] Sin: And Iiiiiii was thinkin', shortly thereafter Iqiazath should go up, and Aboleoth needs to be all catchycatchy.

<i>Somewhere near the south pole...</i>

Thick winter brings bitterness to the Southern Wastes. Although Rukbat rules a cloudless sky the temperature is below zero. Aboleoth, largely ignorant of the cold, has his wings loose to catch what slim amount of sunlight they can this close to Pern's pole. His rider isn't far away on a low, but craggy hill. A patch of exposed basement rock has the bronzerider, bulky in furs, interested. 

Far overhead, a green dragon winks in from ::between:: and begins circling for a landing; in this unfamiliar territory, her landing is -- if not cautious, at least not as reckless as some.  Her rider dismounts, traditional exploration gear abandoned for something a little bit warmer: even her flight leathers are not enough, and have been paired with a fur-lined hood and thicker boots.  The pair are familiar, if not guaranteed to be welcome: Sin strides toward B'ane, while Iqiazath exchanges greetings with Aboleoth.

B'ane bears a hand from its fur and leather case to inspect a fist-sized rock first by sight, then by touch. Aboleoth displaces a warning to B'ane, a coarse, low growl, and for Iqiazath he turns his head up that he may watch her descent. B'ane tucks his chin against his shoulder to weather the blast of frozen air and tossed grit. Once recovered, ""what's wrong?"" Immediately thinking the worst. B'ane's tan has stayed with him, his eyes protected from snow blindness by modified riding goggles.

Sin doesn't answer until she is close enough that she does not have to shout; even for one High Reaches born, this is shardin' cold.  ""Nothing!"" she assures, voice low as slightly rough, though not unusually so.  ""Ryazusith takes to the skies in flight, soon, and we--"" she jerks a thumb back to indicate Iqiazath as well, ""chose not to be around for it.  Haven't come and checked on your progress this turn, so --"" They are here.

""Nverath, he's still hale?"" Thinking of the queen's mate and consequently his rider as Weyrleader. He picks up the rock and none to slowly entombs his hand back inside the insulated mit. Walking the short distance, B'ane has lost none of his height. ""Take a look,"" exposing the sample. ""Do you see a plant in there, like a small frond?"" Aboleoth, ever aloof, doesn't seem to refuse the green's association.

""As ever -- there's little doubt of the flight's outcome, given the current climate of the weyr.""  The greenrider extracts a gloved hand from her pocket, and flexes fingers against the cold before reaching for the sample.  Sin uses B'ane's bulk to shield her from the worst of the chill, as she examines it.  ""I think I've seen something like this,"" she finally declares, ""in the jungles near Southern Weyr -- but here?""  Also, in rock.  Huh.  Iqiazath's smaller-than average frame is dwarfed by her bronzen companion, but she seems unfazed; her head lowers close to his, and she remarks on -- something.

B'ane's covered hand remains still. ""You're going back soon, right? You want to take this with you? Pass it around the miners. There's sure to be more..."" Sin's windbreak is destined again for the patch of rock. He stoops and weedles loose stone around with a slender piece he tries to coax his padded fingers around. The outcrop overlooks B'ane's encampment which is drawn from the snow itself. ""How's the Weyr?"" D'baji, Lzi, Minka.

Sin carefully, carefully puts the fossil in a pocket; snow crunches underfoot as she follows B'ane toward the patch of exposed rock.  ""We're here 'til we get word that Ryazusith has flown,"" she admits without looking at the bronzerider, instead concentrating on his excavation efforts.  ""The weyr is flourishing.  Siraji seems to've struck up a sometimes-friendship, sometimes-rivalry with Lykane...""

Sin adds, after a moment's thought, ""Admittedly, she's two, so it could go either way.""

B'ane's hood slips too far out front while the angle of his head steepens. Presently, no other intriguing specimens leap out from the persistent administrations. ""Really..."" The bronzerider's words are shaped upon entry by a thin smile. ""I saw him last, what, two sevendays ago? Probably a few days more. Does he ever say anything about me, here?"" This banishment of self has its casualties. Aboleoth pivots his body in place with the migration of the sun. He's an active bronze, leaner than many dragons who lose discipline during an Interval. Hunting Southern species weekly gives shallow scratches to his hide when the fight brings him into dense growth.

""He's four, B'ane,"" Sin chides gently.  ""He doesn't -- understand.""  Somehow, she refrains from adding that neither does anyone else, for that matter.  She moves closer to him, her chin up and her shoulders back, surveying the stretch of snow before them.  Iqiazath learns quickly, and follows Aboleoth's motion: her hide is tracked by small, insignificant scars caused by incautious flight during erratic Fall -- none enough to ground her, but all enough to mark.

What inconsequential nodding B'ane does to Sin is protected by his fur-bristled hood. ""Nothin' here,"" the dragonman slowly gains a stand. ""At least, I'm not seeing it. If I had a guess more snow would need to be cleared and the bedrock scoured a lot deeper. I'll flag it though."" There's a bulky pack he pulls a marker from, bright, so that they might easily return. ""Ahhh,"" turning his face towards Rukbat, back to the west wind. ""Anything else of interest been discovered, leader?""

""There have been some ruins out in the jungles, Southern-way, but yours are the only things that're getting much attention.""  If it can even be called that.  She hunches further into her fur-lined hood and jacket, and turns to study B'ane's profile in the sun.  ""Do you find the desolation to your taste, bronzerider?""

B'ane purposely aims his breath higher into the air with a boost from his chin. Those vapor molecules spread into new enormity. ""Someone has to do it. I'm, we're, not complaining."" From the safeguard of tinted goggles does B'ane actively take in the extreme landscape. He's sure to include his life mate, still cutting a basking, aquiline profile. ""We've gotten used to it. The worst of the winter winds are over, I actually caught fish down in the bay, that one that looks like a man's fist.""

""We saw it when we were coming in,"" Sin reveals of the bay, ""and I'm sure that Aboleoth has had no problems fending for himself.""  The greenrider's attention shifts from the bronzerider to his mount, which is why it may be difficult to catch when she says, ""The weyr-- no.  We miss you, B'ane and Aboleoth.""

B'ane tucks one hand under an armpit for the warmth and easy way to relax the limb. He seeks confirmation in Aboleoth although the adult bronze doesn't assume eye contact from his angle of repose. ""And we miss it too."" A shoulder prepares for a defensive shrug. ""We'll be home when we're done, just like any job."" Sin gets a full glance of bug-like eyes. 

""I know.  And until I can go home--"" She sticks a hand out, his direction.  ""I'm on assignment with you.  Hey, partner.""  At least she did not in fact say 'howdy'.

B'ane doesn't take the hand, the bait, but he amicably enough tugs his head towards the soft slope to his station. ""C'mon, you haven't see the new base yet, have you? We moved about three leagues southeast from the original one. Got too unstable over time."" Walking around the exposed surface rock into the icy snow that snaps immediately under slight pressure.

Sin refrains from MAKING A FACE, but it is a near thing.  ""Nah, not yet,"" she answers as she trucks along behind him, casting a slightly wary glance back over her shoulder at their lifemates.  The bronze and green are both steady, and so she soldiers on.  ""What else have you found?""

B'ane jaunts down the hill despite its crevaces and foot traps. He is of the terrain. ""Not much! We do more mapping than anything. Hey, remember that 'arm' that lead out, someone called it Danyon's Point? It was made of solid ice like you thought. Half of it calved right off late this spring. Danyon,"" whomever that guy was, ""just became an amputee.""

Sin's progress behind is more cautious -- while she is not a novice at rough terrain by any means, she is still respectful.  ""I was right?"" she questions as she scrambles a little and sliiiiides before regaining her footing.  ""/Brilliant/.  You documented it, of course?""

(And then B'ane's player had to go so we assumed Iqiazath rose and Aboleoth gladly caught her)"

[IstaWLM] R'lar: Let's go.  Anyone else wanna visit Ry at IH?  Like, oh, N'ano.  His father.  Who loves him dearly.
[IstaWLM] R'lar: Or B'aney-o.  Who always needs more socialization.
[IstaWLM] B'ane has snubbed a lot of people recently.
[IstaWLM] R'lar: Oh yeah?  Snubber.
[IstaWLM] B'ane: It must be a full moon.
[IstaWLM] Lzi: Just point me in what direction you'll be, R'lar.
[IstaWLM] R'lar: IH -> Fireheights -> Watchrider's Room
[IstaWLM] R'lar: Fine.  Ry will have to grope Lzi without B'aney-boy's permission then.
[IstaWLM] B'ane: >_>
[IstaWLM] N'ano is busy, belatedly. RPing already :D
[IstaWLM] R'lar: Mwahaha.
[IstaWLM] R'lar: Lanti and Shay take precedence over your #1 son?  ;_;
[IstaWLM] Lzi: Hey, they're both hot stuff.
[IstaWLM] R'lar will die if N'ano sleeps with Lanti.
[IstaWLM] N'ano: Dude. N'ano's just giving her her green stuff.
[IstaWLM] R'lar: Good.  XD

[Hurricane] N'ano shows off his new knot here, too XD
[Hurricane] B'ane: Square knot or Gordian knot?
[Hurricane] N'ano: Dork.
[Hurricane] B'ane likes exploring all venues.
[Hurricane] R'lar: Doesn't he look handsome in his new knot?
[Hurricane] N'ano has too many knots, even after getting rid of one.
[Hurricane] B'ane: Don't forget to hang your practicing certificate on your wall.
[Hurricane] N'ano beams.
[Hurricane] R'lar smirks.
[Hurricane] Taya: You got a new knot?
[Hurricane] N'ano nods.
[Hurricane] B'ane: Village idiot.
[Hurricane] B'ane runs!
[Hurricane] N'ano kicks B'ane in the nuts.
[Hurricane] R'lar: Ha!!
[Hurricane] Taya eyes B'ane.... ""That's new?"" *runs too*
[Hurricane] R'lar runs along with the rest.
[Hurricane] B'ane rolls in pain. But it was worth it.
[Hurricane] R'lar: We <3 you, N'ano.  ^^
[Hurricane] B'ane: I fight you because I love you.
[Hurricane] R'lar: There's no one I'd rather get a broken nose from.
[Hurricane] B'ane: Hey that applies to you too, Lzi XD
[Hurricane] Lzi: Yeah yeah.
[Hurricane] R'lar: Same here.  XD
[Hurricane] B'ane: This is a channel of love.
[Hurricane] N'ano shall not give lollipops out the next time you guys visit the infirmary.
[Hurricane] R'lar: Daww.
[Hurricane] Taya: Yah, you will ;)
[Hurricane] Lzi: We'll see how you feel about  me when I blow away in this hurricane and you can't find me.
[Hurricane] B'ane: WTH. I'm switching practictioners to Shayla then.
[Hurricane] B'ane will go out 'Marco!' looking for Lzi.
[Hurricane] Taya eyes.... ""Note to self, have N'ano babysit Tama and Aya..."" *chokes* I forgot Taya's son's name for a bit ^^
[Hurricane] R'lar needs a son.
[Hurricane] N'ano: No you don't.
[Hurricane] R'lar: Yes I do.
[Hurricane] Taya: Want Tama?
[Hurricane] B'ane has a son with Ry. Clooone.
[Hurricane] R'lar: Who'd want another /you/?
[Hurricane] B'ane looks indignant.
[Hurricane] R'lar shoves.  Loser.
[Hurricane] Lzi wants a kid, too. We should all start a club or something.
[Hurricane] B'ane: But you have two. We're poorer :(
[Hurricane] B'ane: We need to catch up to N'ano.
[Hurricane] R'lar: Yep.  Best start now.
[Hurricane] N'ano has to add the latest to the list.
[Hurricane] B'ane: Is there a list?
[Hurricane] B'ane: I mean an official one.
[Hurricane] B'ane gets curious. Plus he forgets a lot and needs a reference to come back to.
[Hurricane] N'ano: Under my @history
[Hurricane] R'lar nodnods.  Ry's at the top, yo.
[Hurricane] N'ano: Hey Lzi, what was that dead one's name?
[Hurricane] Lzi: Nalin.
[Hurricane] N'ano: I forgot to add him too.
[Hurricane] Lzi mourns.
[Hurricane] N'ano: So that officially makes the count up to 20.
[Hurricane] R'lar: Of dead ones?  XD
[Hurricane] N'ano: No, 2 dead ones. Technically, 2 fosterlings. So 16 living. 18 bred.
[Hurricane] Taya: Children?
[Hurricane] N'ano: No, cats.
[Hurricane] B'ane throws in the toweling. Too much mating involved.
[Hurricane] R'lar has a hard time /finding/ a mate.
[Hurricane] Taya: That's a lotta cats, N'ano...
[Hurricane] B'ane: That's because you're out in no man's land, Ry.
[Hurricane] R'lar: Don't I know it..
[Hurricane] Taya snickers. 
[Hurricane] B'ane: Cojiroth might start to look nice after a while. *shudders*
[Hurricane] R'lar punches.
[Hurricane] B'ane: Anyone else for a go at me?
[Hurricane] N'ano: Nay.
[Hurricane] Lzi keeses.
[Hurricane] R'lar kicks B'aney-pie a few times.  I feel better now.
[Hurricane] B'ane: Yay. *spits out a tooth*
[Hurricane] B'ane is happy Lzi still loves him. Last time he checked.
[Hurricane] Taya gives B'ane a cookie? Gingerbread....
[Hurricane] Lzi still loves. For the most part.
[Hurricane] B'ane: And Taya goes straight to my heart.
[Hurricane] Taya: I try :D
[Hurricane] B'ane reserves a spot for him and Lzi on Dr. Phil.
[Hurricane] B'ane: And N'ano too
[Hurricane] Lzi dies laughing.
[Hurricane] Lzi: Or Jerry Springer.
[Hurricane] B'ane thinks they would pay us to go back home.
[Hurricane] N'ano: ...
[Hurricane] Taya: Dr. Phil after Jerry Springer... you'll need the therapy.
[Hurricane] B'ane: Or he'd be like, ""I'm a therapist, not a magician.""
[Hurricane] R'lar: BRB.  Phone..
[Hurricane] D'baji has joined this channel.
[Hurricane] Taya: ACK!
[Hurricane] D'baji eyes...
[Hurricane] R'lar: Hide!
[Hurricane] Taya hides behind R'lar.
[Hurricane] R'lar hides behind Lzi.
[Hurricane] Lzi hides behind B'ane.
[Hurricane] B'ane is a tree. Tree, I tell you!
[Hurricane] Mailli has joined this channel.
[Hurricane] Mailli fluffs the channel. :)
[Hurricane] R'lar: Oooh.
[Hurricane] B'ane: Poor Mailli and all these crazy riders.
[Hurricane] has seven persons listening.
B'ane, R'lar, Lzi, N'ano, Taya, D'baji, and Mailli
[Hurricane] Mailli snerks. B'ane, you don't know me very well. ;)
[Hurricane] Mailli would suggest keeping the hurricane below Cat 5. o.O 
[Hurricane] R'lar: Where's the fun in that? XD
[Hurricane] Lzi: Hey now, this may be a hurricane channel, but we're not about talking about the hurricane right now. 
[Hurricane] B'ane frowns and wanted to see if a category six would give his hair body.
[Hurricane] Mailli chuckles. 
[Hurricane] Mailli dies! 
[Hurricane] Taya eyes B'ane's hair... ""Nah, not strong 'nough..""
[Hurricane] Mailli: Hmm. You sure?
[Hurricane] Taya: Pretty sure.
[Hurricane] Mailli: Okay. 
[Hurricane] Taya: Though I'm all for testing that theory
[Hurricane] Mailli snerks.
[Hurricane] B'ane thinks at least a 3 will suffice.
[Hurricane] Mailli: Actually it would all depend on how much damage you feel like RPing clean up for. 
[Hurricane] Taya: No, no, we hafta try a 6... just to test the theory... *looks all innocent like*
[Hurricane] Mailli eyes Taya. 
[Hurricane] Taya: Oh, shush, you all know that I'm angelic like
[Hurricane] Lzi: Hey, we do it big here at Ista Weyr.
[Hurricane] B'ane: Seriously? 
[Hurricane] Taya: Depends on how big big is.
[Hurricane] Taya: And on what we're doing ^^
[Hurricane] B'ane is set for catastrophic, it's what other people want to consider.
[Hurricane] Mailli: Welll... Cat 5 is the limit, of course on Pern maybe the Cat system isn't quite the same? 
[Hurricane] B'ane: Because the bigger it is the more angst will likely come.
[Hurricane] Lzi wants to get lost in the debris so me and B'ane can play marco polo.
[Hurricane] Mailli: The bigger the storm, the more the angst, the greater the destruction of property, and there will absolutely be loss of life. 
[Hurricane] Taya can envision it... B'ane: Marco?; Lzi: Polo!!!!
[Hurricane] Mailli chokes!
[Hurricane] D'baji: Hurricane: WHOOOOOSH.
[Hurricane] B'ane: At least one death would be nice.
[Hurricane] Mailli: Hey, no fair making me snerk soda up my nose! O.o
[Hurricane] Taya preens.
[Hurricane] Mailli: It would add realism to the TP at the very least. Just keep in mind, the higher the Cat rating the greater the damage and the higher the death toll. *lives in the hurricane belt.*
[Hurricane] B'ane: 'xactly.
[Hurricane] R'lar would totally save Mailli.
[Hurricane] B'ane likes gritty.
[Hurricane] N'ano nods. Katrina was a what, 3 when it hit shore? 2? Something like that (and I should know since I'm doing a presentation on it tomorrow) and the damage was /awful/. 
[Hurricane] B'ane is looking at http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshs.shtml
[Hurricane] Mailli: Katrina was a very strong Cat 5. 
[Hurricane] B'ane: Of course it would depend on readiness, too. A 1 could knock a tree down and flatten someone (like the mime in the forest)
[Hurricane] R'lar: Oh, nice B'ane.
[Hurricane] B'ane picks on the poor mimey.
[Hurricane] Mailli chuckles. But... but... B'ane's da bomb! ;)
[Hurricane] R'lar: B'ane scares people.
[Hurricane] B'ane hasn't been called that in a while ;)
[Hurricane] Mailli bonds with B'ane. I scare people too. *.*
[Hurricane] B'ane: Are you from Tillek, too?
[Hurricane] R'lar: You're from Tillek?
[Hurricane] Mailli is from Bitra. But I still scare people.
[Hurricane] B'ane figures the place must have been built on a radiation dump.
[Hurricane] N'ano is Bitran!
[Hurricane] R'lar: Bitra!  B'ane, didn't you write a poem about Bitra?  ;D
[Hurricane] B'ane: Yah, B'ane's from there. He doesn't really say he is though.
[Hurricane] B'ane did! It's in a log somewhere..

[Birthplace] Blue_Guest has connected.
[Birthplace] B'ane says, ""Welcome to HT, guest! We serve dinner at 5, promptly, with brandy and cigars afterwards.""
[Birthplace] Blue_Guest blinks, ""Brandy... is she good looking?"" ;)
[Birthplace] B'ane says, ""Ha! Her sister's prettier.""
[Birthplace] Mailli says, ""You can have mine.""
[Birthplace] Mailli hrms. The cigar, I'll keep the brandy. ;)
[Birthplace] Blue_Guest eyes you all suspeciously. ;)
[Birthplace] Mailli says, ""Sanity is highly over-rated. ;)""
[Birthplace] B'ane says, ""It's the brandy. She's a loud-talker.""
[Birthplace] Mailli thinks B'ane is giving away secrets. o.o
[Hurricane] Mailli has a long history that gives Mailli's back story, but I don't remember where I put it. o.o
[Birthplace] B'ane says, ""Right-o. You have to be a member of the club to get gossip.""
[Birthplace] B'ane says, ""So, cheap tricks aside, anything we can help you with?""
[Guides] *** New player ""Krias"" has just been created by Blue_Guest. ***
[Birthplace] Blue_Guest ohs and says, ""Well i could use a few things...."" ;)
[Birthplace] B'ane says, ""No ray guns though. You need to collect 15,000 Proofs of Purchase for one of those.""
[Birthplace] Mailli says, ""Ray-*headshakes* never mind. I don't want to know. o.O""
[Birthplace] Blue_Guest ponders any spare dragons not being used? j/k :)
[Birthplace] Krias has connected.
[Guides] LagWiz: Krias has connected for the first time.
[Birthplace] Mailli says, ""Welcome to Harper's Tale MOO. :)""
[Birthplace] B'ane sells you his.
[Birthplace] Mailli says, ""o.o""
[Birthplace] B'ane says, ""Dragon, not ray gun. Those Proofs of Purchase were too hard to come by."""

Cloudscraper Lounge
Deep blue carpets the floor, cushioning tired soles and muffling footfalls. Several tables of dark wood, polished to a high gloss, are scattered across the room, surrounded by an escort of comfortable leather chairs. The walls are paneled in the same dark wood, occasionally sporting a jewel-toned tapestry or painting. A long counter stretches along one wall of the room, stone sides and brass accents gleaming from careful polishing. Glassware hangs overhead within easy reach, a rack of bottles stands behind. Glass-paned double doors let the sun in to light the room, reflecting off the gleaming wood and brass of the furniture before being broken up into thousands of tiny fragments by the... [look closer]
Lzi is here.
Obvious exits:
Hall

B'ane is eyeing the lounge like he hasn't seen it in fifty, not ten Turns; he is not so used to opulence. Clean and casually dressed the bronzerider is composed in dark pants and light poet's shirt. For once the boots have been left in the weyr and more functional leather shoes are being broken in for the first time. It's quite full already with many background voices blended into a solid drone. ""I should have cut my hair or something."" A nervous hand slides over the unshorn locks threaded with random strands of grey. At least it's combed.

Lzi, as can be expected, is not exactly so casual. Any night out without the kids is a reason for a celebration, and what better way to celebrate it than with a fancy, and very sexy, dress. At the mention of his hair, Lzi looks up to peer at B'ane and more importantly his hair. ""It doesn't look bad. You look very handsome."" But the grey hairs are definitely noticed, causing a secretive grin to take over her face before eyes go out to look for an empty table. 

B'ane draws his fingers through his hair to compliment the side part and to enforce it some. Just after Lzi takes stock of him his eyes are flicked over to her. He corrects, ""I look very lucky..."" B'ane experiences a new kind of reaction with his knots left at home. To everyone else he is just an ordinary man worthy of ignoring -- that is, he is just the fellow attached to an attractive woman's arm.

""You look /handsome/,"" Lzi corrects, giving his arm a squeeze as she grins up at him. An empty table is pointed to, and she leads them in that direction. ""I couldn't even tell you the last time I was here. I always feel weird being in such a fancy place. Like I don't belong, you know? I just don't think of myself as a fancy sort of person. Give me some fried tubers and some brandy, and I'm set."" Or so Lzi would like people to believe.

That arm takes some initiative to loop around Lzi's waist. It's a sign of territorial affection. Absently Lzi's chair is pulled out before one across from her is arranged to accomodate his body. ""I know what you mean. I was here last the with Jozzie, Kia and... Rishk."" His voice levels out like a heart monitor. ""I feel like these clothes need a few stains and rough patches to feel, I don't know, normal."" Speaking of which, ""that's a- where did you get that dress? I don't think I've ever seen it.""

""Thank you,"" Lzi says absently as her chair is pulled out by B'ane, slowly lowering herself down into said chair. At the mention of her dress, she grins, looking down at it as if reminding herself what she's wearing. ""I bought this a few sevendays ago. Brand new, never have worn it before. I was saving it for a special occassion, and this seemed like the perfect special occassion. Do you like it?"" Lzi has to question, peering up at him. Such a loaded question.

B'ane leans back a titch to ease the waist of his pants to a more comfortable fit around his hips. Affably, ""no, it looks great, t'was made for you."" His legs under the table take up more than their equal share once they are acclimated. ""I'm just wondering how you went Between in that thing.""

""Sometimes, dresses are made to look good, not for their practical use,"" is how Lzi answers his question, shrugging a shoulder. ""One of the curses of being a woman, I suppose. Vanity all of the time."" Eyes wander around to see who all is currently there, as well to see is there's anyone else checking out that dress of hers. But enough about her. ""So what are we going to have to eat, hmm? I'll have whatever you're having, as long as it's nothing weird,"" Lzi adds at the end, shooting him an amused look. Comes from knowing him too well.

""Or you could have came in grubby gear and changed here in your dress. But wait, that must beat the purpose of making a good entrance though, right?"" B'ane, too, is starting to catch on. ""Eat? I think we'll have breakfast here by the looks of this place and the run-ragged staff. Not fish. I've had enough of that."" So much for Ista's prize-winning staple.  

""Exactly."" B'ane is a very fast learner in the realm of women, that's for sure. ""No fish,"" Lzi agrees, rolling her eyes at the mention of that particular food. ""Herdbeast sounds good. Wherry. Whatever. I'm good with whatever is not fish. Whatever's the quickest,"" she says, looking over the staff and bustle. ""To be honest, it's just nice to be away from the kids for awhile,"" Lzi says as she leans forward, extending a hand to B'ane as a cute offer to hold hands on the tabletop.

A server scurries by with a slanted glance that translates as 'I know you're there. Be back sometime in 5-60 minutes.' B'ane shucks an easy-going nod. He didn't come here for the food. His hand stalks Lzi's and swallows it. ""I have to tell myself it's okay when I don't see or hear them, that no, we didn't lose them."" A small puff of air from his nostrils is a free laugh. ""How're the weyrlings? And any word of L'nin?"" 

It gets a laugh from Lzi, too, nodding her head in agreeance. ""I just hope they are having fun. I felt horrible for leaving Lykane. He's had that cold for a few days now, and it breaks my heart that he's so sick."" A frown takes her lips down when thinking about their son, but talk of the weyrlings soon makes that frown disappear. ""The weyrlings are great. Growing every single day, you know how it is. L'nin is...bearable, I guess. If I was Weyrlingmaster, I would do things differently, but..."" A shrug finishes off that sentence. ""I think I might take a break from weyrlingmastering next clutch, so I can spend time more time with you and the kids. Take on a more motherly role, try to be a better weyrmate.""

""Your heart will break even more when we all come down with it,"" Knowledgable on the pattern of disease and children. Of Lzi's response and plans, ""I haven't heard any complaints so far,"" polling Linnau, Lykane, Lilly and himself. ""It's good your not always accessable to them, me, because we miss you more for it."" His weyrmate's fingers are gently tugged up. ""And Dedanseth's eggs."" He just brings the topic up and leaves it emotionally barren. 

B'ane's fingers are squeezed in a response to his words, a smile coming to her lips. ""You guys don't miss me when I'm gone. I'm sure everyone's thrilled when I leave. A break from bad mommy."" Which she has been called on occassion, mainly by Lilly. Dedanseth and her eggs aren't touched on as a point of conversation. Instead, Lzi heads back to an old subject. ""I hope we don't all catch that cold. I can't afford to be sick, nor do I want to be sick. When I get sick, I get /sick/. I'll be stuck in bed for a sevenday, and you'll have to wait on me and take care of me."" Though there is a glimmer in her eyes for that idea.

B'ane's eyes stare down a different server who gets the hint. ""I'm so sorry we kept you waiting,"" she's a pretty blonde, barely leaving her teens behind. ""Can I get you anything to drink?"" B'ane kills superficialities. ""Yes please and food as well. Whatever isn't picked over we'll have. Mixed ale for me,"" he cues Lzi for her order. 

Lzi stares down the woman to either compare herself to the blonde or to warn the woman away from any sort of flirting with B'ane. She, too, can be possessive. ""I'll have a glass of Tillek red, please."" Brown eyes then to go to B'ane to make sure he's not staring after the server as she leaves. ""Thank you for bringing me here. It's really nice of you.""

B'ane stares all right, at the carpet. ""How do they keep this so clean that's what I want to know."" The server is already kicking up her heels and showering her smiles at other patrons. ""You're welcome,"" grounding their hands back onto the table and smiling. ""I didn't know if you'd enjoy it or a material gift more, but what convinced me was the break from the children. Might have been a gift in itself.""

""It's definitely a gift. Not that I don't love them and love being around them, but they definitely test my patience and nerves. Lilly especially. I think she's my parents' revenge on me for the way I treated them when I was a child,"" Lzi comments, shaking her head just slightly. ""I can't believe how fast Lykane is growing up. Seems just like yesterday we were arguing about having him."" And for this, B'ane gets another squeeze of his hand.

B'ane turns his lips to moisten them. They flash amusement when Lzi speaks of her parent's revenge. ""Well she is headstrong, but very smart. I'd like to see what her future holds for her when she grows up. And Lykane, he is still ripe with potential. But onto Lilly, I haven't gotten any bad reports from the teaching harper, unless you had... I think Linnau is good at keeping her in line.""

""If it wasn't for Linny, I think Lilly would be much worse behaved than she is. I guess taking Linnau in has been a blessing in disguise."" A pause, then Lzi chuckles lightly under her breath. ""I need to stop naming my kids beginning with the letter L. I imagine it's worse for you. Lzi, Linnau, Lilly, and Lykane. That's too many L's."" Perhaps a little hidden agenda there from the greenrider, but she says nothing else to clarify.

B'ane observes a Farmcrafter and two friends invest into some kind of story that requires acting and flashy hand movements. The Maverick latches onto this type of clandestine charades. ""Are you kidding? That's how I remember you all. It's terribly convenient."" Still with no food or drink yet, B'ane leans more into his plush chair, their arms becoming more taut. ""You're being not-so-subtly subtle,"" holdings the greenrider's eyes. 

Caught, all Lzi has for B'ane is a smile. A flush even rises to her cheeks at him seeing through her so easily. Even still, her eyes remain on his. ""I don't want to start another fight, and I certainly don't want to fight in public. But, with that being said, I have been thinking about names for our next child, should there be a next child. I mean, you know I would like there to be. I'm not going to deny the fact that I want another. And you've made it more than clear that you don't so...we've reached a stalemate.""

B'ane's body posture will give nothing away, it's aloof and still like Lzi was carrying on about the mundane. His blinks are regularly spaced with no sense of ultimatum. ""I told you dinner at the Cloudscraper was what I had decided on, but I was going to tell you after we'd eaten. Oh well."" A pause. It's to see if he can make her squirm. ""Even if you got pregnant right away Lykane would be almost two, that's old enough.""

The pause does in fact make Lzi squirm, narrowing her eyes in on her weyrmate for a moment. And the get further narrowed after he's done speaking. ""What are you saying?"" Even with no alcohol in her system, Lzi's brain doesn't exactly filter the information correctly just yet. Until B'ane further clarfies, she refrains from throwing a temper tantrum or celebrating.

B'ane is never a simple yes man or no man. He's in it for the theatrics. His hand is disentangled from Lzi's and is reeled in so it teeters just off his side of the table. ""I'm saying that your body has sufficiently recovered from Lykane's term, he's weaned, and there will be a good age gap between he and another brother or sister."" Better yet his hand was taken away so Lzi won't squeeze the hell out of it.

Surprisingly, Lzi's not jumping up and down in joy upon hearing the news. A wide smile is the only outward signs of her opinion about B'ane's announcement as arms are crossed over her chest, the greenrider just staring him down for a long moment. ""You sure about this? You're not going to go into panic mode when and if I find out I'm pregnant again, right?""

B'ane's hand flips open in a manual shrug-type gesture. ""If you're in, I'm in. It'll be nice to have one who wasn't an act of 'desperation with a purpose' after the hurricane."" B'ane renews the sway of his hair even though it isn't really that long to begin with. An eyebrow flinches a bit closer to the eye it caps. ""I didn't freak out the last time... Did I?""  

Lzi doesn't comment on Lykane being an act of desperation with a purpose, still silently watching B'ane. However, at his question, a snort of laughter comes out of her. ""Honey, you /lost/ it. I mean, I know I stunned and shocked you, but you weren't yourself for at least a sevenday after. Don't you remember what you said when you asked me to be your weyrmate? You just, like, shut down when I told you. You weren't happy, you weren't sad, you weren't angry. You were just blank. I didn't get a good reaction from you, the reaction I was hoping for.""

B'ane cushions a cheek with a hand, fingers sprouting in a few different directions. ""Yes I remember, I didn't freak out I just didn't know what to make of it. I suppose I still don't, but I get a little better each day I guess."" His eyes are warm, but they last in no place for very long. The food is timed just right, two dishes of raw leafy greens with something that looks like a designer meatroll - a BMW against a Chevy. ""I'm sorry it took to long folks, it's just the crowd here is booming. There's a few journeymen walking the tables tonight."" A different server than the blonde swirls away once the plates have been delivered. ""Hm, kinda neat."" Either he's talking about the food or the graduating apprentices.

""You're an excellent to father to all three, sweetie. None of them can say that they aren't loved. You've embraced Lilly and Linnau as if they were your own, and that makes me..."" Whatever it makes Lzi feel is interrupted by the arrival of their food. ""Finally. I think my stomach was about to eat itself,"" she comments, grinning as a napkin is politely laid over her lap. Don't want to get anything on her dress, after all. ""Looks good,"" is said about the food before eyes wander toward the journeymen. ""Must be an exciting feeling.""

""...number three."" B'ane finishes for Lzi with a small smirk on the agenda. After debating how best to infiltrate the wrapped meat the man decides to manipulate it like a regular meatroll they all know and love. ""Probably a little like what it is to Impress only modified to Turns of dedication and recognition of your peers and not a living animal. But I bet the pride is the same,"" mouth opening wide for the premiere bite.

There's an idea that comes into Lzi's mind, causing a little grin to come to her face, but nothing is mentioned. At least for the moment. Getting B'ane to agree to another kid is enough for one day, but the idea is definitely shuffled away to be remembered some other time. ""Yeah. I remember how happy my parents were when two of my brothers became Harper journeymen. Threw them a /huge/ party, bragged to all of their friends. They were so proud."" A bitter memory to be sure, making Lzi frown as a fork attacks the greens first.

B'ane tucks a piece of lettuce into the opening of the roll. Brown eyes lift to Lzi even as a voice rises in a background in some sort of toast preparation. ""While you were left out?""

""Not only that, but they were never as proud of me as they were of Kale and Ian. Even when I wrote to them to tell them that I impressed Izlasth, nothing. They had nothing to say. No big party, no bragging to their friends."" More frowning creases Lzi's face, pushing around more greens rather than eating them. ""Sorry. I don't want to be a downer. We should be celebrating like they are,"" Lzi says, pointing her fork toward the journeyman and friends.

B'ane swallows what he reacts is an agreeable, if belated, supper. ""We're kindred in that sense."" Each can identify with not living up to parental expectation. ""It doesn't mean we're any less successful just because we don't have their validation."" A few crumbs are chased from a mouth corner. Blinking languidly, ""our celebrations are usually best not kept public."" 

Hearing that she and B'ane have that particular thing in common gets a smile from Lzi, tilting her head to regard him with a soft expression. ""And that's why I love you so much. We seem like opposites, yet we're so similar."" At least the mood she was formerly in is gone. But unfortunately, a new kind of mood has taken over. ""Speaking of celebrations, with the kids spending the night at the nursery, we'll have the weyr to all to ourselves,"" Lzi mentions not-so-innocently. ""That'll be a nice change.""

B'ane is more thorough in his processing of his bite, but mobilizes it into one cheek to ask, ""how's yours?"" The multi-meat roll is lifted a half-inch higher for better indication of his question. ""Nice? I might actually get some work done."" 'Work' is preceded by a loose definition.

""Huh? Oh, it's delicious."" And to show this, Lzi takes a bite of that salad, making a yummy noise. At B'ane's comment, she just rolls her eyes as a response while she chews before saying, ""You'll definitely be able to get a lot of work done. And you won't have to fight for covers tonight."" Linny is a blanket hog, and Lykane can be a lump in the middle of the bed. ""I almost forget what it's like to sleep alone in a bed with you.""

B'ane crams more from the bed of lettuce into the main course any way he can. Greens taste better in accompaniment. ""Aye."" He just keeps his face turned towards his weyrmate, glance sharp, jaw grinding and the corner of his lips just up enough to show he can't be up to any good.

Lzi returns the look, though her eyes and lips reveal more evil intentions than his. ""But first, we should finish eating. Faranth knows it took long enough for us to get it. No reason to waste it."" But until both are finished with their meals and able to adjourn to a more private area, one of Lzi's feet is definitely rubbing against his leg slowly, teasingly.

B'ane is distracted when a welt of laughter bursts from the back left of the lounge. Someone is named. ""That's for sure. And it'll probably set me back new riding straps, gloves at least."" The practical mind is always ticking. ""But if I didn't say it before, happy Turnday, Lzi."" The mug of ale, still bubbling but lukewarm, is lifted and sluiced back.

""Thank you, sweetie. For dinner and the turnday wishes,"" Lzi says as she lifts her wine glass in toast before taking a few sips to finish it off. ""And I'll make sure to buy you new straps and gloves for /your/ turnday, which is coming up quicker than you think."" And don't think for a second that Lzi doesn't have plans in mind for his 40th turnday celebration. Time passes, food disappears, and soon, Lzi's standing, offering a hand to B'ane. ""Now, I think it's time that we /both/ go and celebrate. Alone.""

B'ane chases the last of the wrap with a second, healthy mouthful of the full-bodied brew. ""I didn't say I /needed/ them right away, just-"" His eyes make an easy gesture to Izlasth's rider as her hand darts out. The small mug hovers in his hands before it is tipped back to empty whatever his mouth can hold. Daubing a napkin across his face, B'ane's fist joins his weyrmate's and the chair slid closer to the table. Check, please."

Weyr Plateau
  You stand on the broad grassy plateau of Ista Weyr, between the gaps in the Weyr Rim.  An eruption long ago blew out the western wall of the Weyr, forming the plateau.  The shadowy Weyr bowl stretches off to the east, and the five-pointed pinnacles of the Weyr Rim tower into the sky like fingers reaching to the clouds.  West, the plateau drops off in a somewhat steep slope, down to the black sand beaches below.  The glittering turquoise waters of the ocean are easily visible from here, stretching off to the horizon.
  It is a summer evening.  
Hiding in the grass are two firelizards.
Lzi is here.
Obvious exits:
Central Bowl     Forest     Beach     Corral

""And then Linny picked up Lykane, turned to me, and said 'But mummy, I thought you said he needed changed!'"" Lzi tells B'ane, chuckling after her story of the night before is finished up. A content sigh is expelled as she continues to stroll hand-in-hand with her weyrmate, keeping an eye on the horizon. ""So where are you taking me, anyway? Are you getting me lost in the forest for my turnday?""

B'ane purposely exaggerates his strides so that they're long, but going no where in a hurry. ""She's getting to be quite a help around the weyr. I'm pleased, very much so, that we all coexist pretty well despite being so,"" hodge-podgey? ""Varied."" Better. His head bows closer towards Lzi to deliver, ""I thought we could cover some ground, talk privately and find strange patterns in stars. But other than that, how do you feel about dinner at the Cloudscraper tomorrow?"" 

""I'm surprised too, for as much of an influence B'au had on her. I figured she'd be dropped off spoiled and hating everything that was me and N'ano, but...all she wants is to be loved, and it's safe to say that she doesn't lack any of that."" Lzi tries to keep pace with B'ane's lengthy strides, having to take two steps for his every one. As far as turnday plans go, they get a soft smile to take over her face as she cranes her neck up to look at him. ""I'd love that. I just can't believe I'm twenty-seven. And that Lykane is almost one. And that we've been together for, what?, two or three turns now? I feel so old.""

""/You/ feel old?"" The bronzerider explains with a dip in pitch with the first word. ""Actually I don't feel old, it's more... insightful. I won't say wiser, not yet anyway."" He pulls and glides Lzi's hand around with his own doing the navigation. ""Do you really feel old?"" Brown eyes settle patiently on his weyrmate.

""I do,"" Lzi replies, her voice pensive as if thinking her own statement over. ""I mean, I have three kids, the oldest of which is /seven/. Linny is seven. I have a seven turn old daugther. And a weyrmate who I've been with for turns now. I guess the combination of it all makes me feel...old. Mature, I guess. Settled. Who would've ever thought that things would've turned out like this for me, you know? I certainly didn't."" But then something else gets Lzi's attention, causing her to peer up at B'ane. ""You really don't feel old? Even when you're pushing forty?"" she can't help but throw back in his face, raising a brow at him.

B'ane basks fondly in the cooler evening air, sampling a hearty breath that fills his chest. ""See mature and old are two very different things, love. I don't see myself as a number, it's hard to after the first two decades of your life. I just go by how I feel I guess. And right now? I can't make protest with my lot, not really. Aboleoth is almost the same age as you are and he certainly is unaware of the passage of time."" 

That gets Lzi to stop in her tracks, dropping her grip on B'ane's hand as she just stares dumbfoundedly after him. ""Aboleoth and I are the same age?"" It's a fact that must not have come up in previous conversations. A hand flies to Lzi's forehead as she drops her gaze to the ground. ""Okay, /now/ I feel old."" Dark eyes remain on the ground before lifting back up to her weyrmate. ""So, I was just a baby, a newborn, and you were impressing Aboleoth?"" she asks, trying to ingrain the fact into her head. ""Wow. I just---wow.""

His hand being dropped draws B'ane to a stop, shoulders gently opening towards the now immobile greenrider. One thumb hooks a pocket and hangs there, the other totally against his side. ""Not newborn, more like four."" Those few more turns might make all the difference in someone's eyes. ""But might I say you both wear it well."" His eyes are keen in the light, what little shines on them is easily reflected.

Lzi continues to just stare at him, brows furrowing together before her face visibly relaxes, a grin tugging at the corners of her mouth. ""I guess I shouldn't complain. I mean, Aboleoth sired Izlasth, so without him and without you, I wouldn't have her."" And /that/ makes all the difference in Lzi's eyes. B'ane's hand is taken again, and she picks up the pace of walking once again. ""I know we have an age gap between us, but I guess it never really hit me before now. So, tell me, babe. What do you have in mind for this turn or so before you're forty? Anything you want to do before then?""

B'ane angles his head so his eyes are centered on the younger woman just before they resume their lack of standard course. Something that relates to the moment, but isn't specific to it courses through his mind. ""Funny how things you might never have known about are connected in some way. It's almost unsettling if you think about it too long, but good to consider cause and effect. Ambitions?"" This he thinks about on no certain terms. ""I guess I haven't thought much of it,"" his expression corroborates this.

If B'ane has nothing in mind, Lzi sure does, giving his hand a light squeeze as she smiles up at him. ""What do you think about another baby?"" Before he has any time to object, or perhaps agree, she's quick to interject, ""I mean, you'll be forty before you know it, and I don't want to be having kids much past thirty, so it makes sense."" To Lzi, at least.

""Another?"" Forgive the slack in the man's jaw. ""You're always good at catching me off guard."" Just as he is always good at dodging questions. ""I don't know, it's definitely something we'll need to ask the girls about,"" Lykane's too young for a group vote. ""But you'd want another?""

""You /don't/ want another?"" Lzi retorts, answering his question with a question of her own. She halts in her step, tugging B'ane to face her when they're stopped. ""Do you really want to be like N'ano, fathering kids when you're almost fifty? I certainly don't. I just thought that we could complete our family with one last one. And you'd have the honor of fathering /two/ of my kids."" Which given Lzi's past should be considered a huge honor.

And suddenly they're stopped again. This time B'ane unleashes a small, irregular pace around his weyrmate to work off the added energy. ""I didn't favor one extreme or the other, just haven't thought things through."" To death. ""I mean I've just been home for more than a sevenday at a time so my thoughts are more tied to the present at the moment."" Lzi and his boots get equal eye contact. ""It's no reflection on you.""

""Yeah. Of course not,"" Lzi replies dryly, starting to walk forward so that B'ane is left to circle around nothing and no one. Arms are folded over her chest as she maintains a slow, leisurely stroll. The greenrider says nothing more, instead turning a pensive gaze toward the horizon and the sunset.

B'ane's ranging is halted as Lzi walks past him. He channels towards her back with empty hands raised: ""So you're going to spend the rest of the evening mad at me, right?"" There is no ire in this, almost a tiredness. After holding position his hands drop and are put to pace with his feet as the man trails.

""No, not mad. Just...I wish that for once we were more alike than different. That everything /I/ want, you want too. I just don't get why we share a life, but don't share the same life aspirations, you know?"" Lzi tosses a look back toward B'ane, as if checking that he's still there. ""I feel like I have to convince you into everything we do. Getting you to want to have Lykane was a struggle that I just can't do again.""

B'ane works a breath in through his mouth and out through his nostrils. It's a type of cleansing ritual more for his brain than his respiratory passages. ""I don't know if there's a bond between two entities that exists where they agree on everything. C'mon, you know I want you happy."" This is paired against, ""but you know I'm seldom impulsive. Just,"" regaining Lzi's side, ""let's enjoy the evening, huh?""

Lzi nods slowly, slipping an arm around her weyrmate's waist. ""Sounds like a plan."" Steps are once again taken together as she keeps her eyes locked solely on B'ane. ""It's so nice to be without the kids for the night. Nice, but I miss them, too. It's weird. I used to love dropping Lilly off at the nannies, and now I'm sad when I have to.""

B'ane looks decidedly proud. ""I believe that's what's called being responsible. Better than that, a true mother."" By now the dirt has given way to softer, but equally as dark sand - the beach is just yonder. ""But it's good you miss them a little just as it's good for them to miss you some as well."" In case words confuse meaning B'ane pushes his lips just under the woman's ear while simultaneously quickening his steps.

""Yeah,"" Lzi's reply comes slowly, her mind still running through words previously said. ""So what's next for us, sweetie?"" she dares to ask, turning her head toward his as her short legs work double time to keep up with B'ane. ""I mean, in our future. What do you see for us, in your own view?""

B'ane allows Lzi's hair to fall over the place just christened. ""There you go with the future again,"" his impatience becomes more... playful. ""Wasn't it some fair greenrider who bade me once upon a time to think more in the now?"" Tailoring their path to an area fringed by beach grass and creeping vines, the man's pace neither slows nor intensifies.

A look is turned up to B'ane that is the combination of many emotions rolled into one. Confusion, looking appalled and offended at his answer, and obvious hurt at the lack of answer. Lzi pulls her eyes away from him to stay outward again, lips pressed together together in what is perhaps an attempt to stop herself from saying anything. The greenrider stays shockingly silent, the only real noise she makes underneath her feet.

B'ane's plans of improvised seduction seem to be blowing up in his face. ""I could say grow old together, but according to you we're currently doing that."" For that, a grin. Aboleoth's rider nestles himself sparsely on the mat of vegetation, legs slightly bent so that his forearms may rest on his thighs. There is more than one way to enjoy the night and B'ane goes for his number two preference of star-gazing.

Lzi, however, is none too amused. Her face remains sour as she stares at him, clearing her throat after a moment's thought. ""Hey, mind if we call it a night early? I, uh, don't feel well, and I really just wanna go back to the weyr and go to bed."" The headache excuse. ""You can stay here as long as you want, but I really just don't feel like it.""

From stars to Lzi, B'ane's focus, and expression, mediates. ""No, that's... fine."" If he doesn't sound perfectly sincere (more confused) a hand gyration will encourage her forth. ""I'll be up in a little while, all right?"" A berry, inevitably very tart for the face he makes, is gleaned off a creeper and eaten.

Lzi maintains her hard exterior, barely even nodding at his words. ""Don't be too late,"" are the only slightly encouraging words she gives to him, the barest of grins on her face as she takes backward steps that lead her away from B'ane before she spins around, heading back toward the bowl. Alone."

Craft Areas
Neatly carved out of the rock, this passage runs straight and wide. The floor is smooth, years of traffic wearing it down in the middle. Glows illuminate the passage, giving it warmth, and doors line both sides, each neatly inscibed with the name of the craft housed within.
Divebombing you from above is a blue firelizard.
Obvious exits:
Dolphineers' Area   Infirmary   Herder's Area   Caverns   Smiths' Area   Weavers' Area   Harpers' Area   Bakers' Area   Vintners' Area   Weyrcrafters' Office   Starcrafter's Area

Lzi walks in from the South Caverns.

Stationed in front of one of the glow shelters, B'ane and a boy of about fifteen turns are the only ones currently blocking the hall channel. ""This one goes to Sin and rather than D'baji, you can give this hide to Raine. If she feels the need she can give it to the Weyrleader."" Freshly washed, B'ane's overgrown hair is more wet than dry. He is dressed in light-colored clothing with a grey vest that might be considered too small for him. The messenger nods and identifies a third scroll. ""And this one, sir?"" B'ane double checks. ""That one goes to Sin as well."" 

""Anything for me?"" Lzi questions in a voice that clearly identifies her mood. Angry. Brows raise as eyes focus on B'ane, arms shifting Lykane higher up on her hip. The babe just coos contently, whacking tiny hands on his mother. ""Am I interrupting anything important?""

B'ane's eyes are faster than his head at lifting at the new voice. With a small grin, ""not unless you're particularly interested in river sytems."" The lad will make himself dizzy with the nods he sheds on B'ane and now, Lzi, as he leaves. ""Thanks, Jem."" B'ane calls before walking impatiently towards his weyrmate and son. ""Good morning,"" initiating a double round of forehead kisses. 

Or perhaps it's not such a good morning for the greenrider, since her expression doesn't lighten up even at the kiss. Lykane, however, squeals after it, intensifying his excited hitting. ""So how long do we have you for this time?"" Lzi questions, looking up at B'ane with slightly narrowed eyes. ""A day? A few, at most?""

B'ane presents his hands in order that he may accept Lykane. ""Ten actually. Then I head to Dorado for three days and then I'm back for at least three months."" B'ane's good humor fades when confronting Lzi's dark aura. He frowns. ""What's wrong?"" 

Lykane is willingly handed over to B'ane, especially since Lzi's arms have tired long before of carrying him around. Hands are then placed on her hips, staring up at the bronzerider. ""What's wrong? What's wrong?"" she repeats, sounding insulted that he'd even ask. ""B'ane, I feel like we're not even together anymore. You're never around. And I understand, I really try to. I know this is your passion, your work, and that's fine, but...I'm a single mother of /three/. Your son barely even knows you,"" Lzi says, gesturing toward Lykane who has now started hitting B'ane in turn. ""I'm just /tired/. I'm tired of taking care of the kids by myself, I'm tired of being lonely, I'm tired."" Softened dark eyes are then turned upward into his.

One of the tassels on his father's vest becomes something new for Lykane to wrap his small fingers around and gum it. B'ane keeps a close eye on the strength of the tassel's attachment. ""I don't have much of a choice. I realize I spend more time afar than here in Ista, but Lzi, we knew that would come. It was one of the main hesitations I had about becoming a father in the first place."" However, he doesn't approach the 'I told you so' catch phrase. He tries something else. ""What would you have me do?"" Finding Lzi's face above Lykane's darkening hair.  

""I don't know,"" Lzi admits slowly, but quickly comes up with more solutions. ""I understand that you have to do /some/ work, but it's hardly fair that when you have a family, you get sent away for sevendays. I have half a mind to go and punch Sin in her stupid face for that,"" the greenrider adds more angrily, eyes flashing. ""I just wish that there could be some sort of a solution where you only get sent away for a few days every few sevendays. I could deal with that. But being gone for sevendays, then only coming back for a day or two before going away again...it's too much.""

B'ane secures Lykane with one arm and spreads his other being Lzi like a great wing to draw her to him. ""I'll inquire about getting some of my duties trimmed as long as you promise not to punch Sin."" His eyes become more focused at the last request. ""I've missed you guys too. Sometimes I don't like the silence as much. Uh, I'll take that."" He weasels the freed tassel from Lykane's persisting grasp. ""Have you worn your comb yet?""

A low chuckle comes out of Lzi at his request as she comes to B'ane's side, pressing her petite body up against his larger one. Eyes are drawn up shortly thereafter to peer at Lykane and his antics. ""He's putting everything in his mouth lately. He loves to suck on my hair...and the feline's tail."" Which has lead to problems. ""I did actually. I had to go and talk to the weyrlings yesterday, and I wore it then. Got lots of compliments on it,"" she adds with a grin directed at her weyrmate.

And good will towards all returned once again. B'ane shifts his young son whose weight has progressed and starts a choice to move on out of the corridor. ""I'm glad."" Forgive the gentle squeeze to Lzi's arm. ""I may go to the barracks to avail my services while I'm here. I think I still remember /something/ of Weyr life."" That is dedicated to Lzi. 

""So long as you avail some of your services to me,"" Lzi replies, a smirk clear on her lips and a evil glint to her eyes. One of Lzi's arms gets wrapped around B'ane's waist as she leans into him slightly, content to walk beside him where ever he may be taking them, a picture of a happy family once more."

Lzi's Wild Love Shack
Dramatically high and carved out of a beautifully light wood, a bed piled high with pink pillows and blankets is set against the farthest wall, the first focus upon entering. Directly infront from the bed is a small, oddly shaped white fur with pillows thrown on top of it, which is aptly named a pillow couch. Near the pillow couch is a large cabinet made of the same wood color as the bed, completely packed with an impressive variety and supply of alcohol, and near the cabinet is a white couch. On the other side of the room is a desk and a dresser, made out of the same light wood as the rest of the furniture. Near the desk is a curtained exit, leading into a small closet area containing... [look closer]
  It is a winter sunset.  
You see Moldy Egg Moronth, Bramble bush, Abstract Woman Sculpture, Lykane, Linnau, and Lilly here.
Lzi is here.
Obvious exits:
Ledge

""What is it, sweetheart?"" Lzi asks of Lilly, turning toward the girl with raised brows. Lykane is shifted back up higher onto her hip as she awaits whatever it is that her daugther has to say.

Lilly licks her lips before running off to the corner. But she has purpose! Quickly, she opens up her little rucksack (it's pink!) and pulls out a small tube. She then scurries her way back towards the woman, beaming proudly as she presents it. ""I made this for you, mummy. Happy turnday!"" Uh, yeah.

Lzi's eyes go even wider at the 'turnday' present, but rather than completely crush the girl, she goes along with it. A loud gasp comes from the greenrider, who kneels down in front of Lilly, reaching a hand out to take the tube. ""Thank you so much, baby! It's beautiful!"" And for it, Lilly gets a big, sloppy kiss from her mother.

Lilly reaches a hand up to her mouth before giggling, using her other hand to swat at Lzi's arm with. ""Noooo. It's inside, silly!"" The hand is then retracted to wipe the kiss away. Nasty. ""Opeeeeen it. OpenitopenOPENIT!"" And what's inside? You know those really hideous tie-dye tunics with sequines and every other fugly adornment? Yeah. At least there are some cute handprints on it and a nice big 'I LOVE MOMMY' on the back. Aww.

An abrupt WHOOMF, dragon strong, is featured outside on the ledge. A part-time stranger, B'ane becomes prominent just past the breezeway. And he bears things. Although his skin is perhaps a shade darker the rider otherwise seems to ward off a few sevendays' worth of change well. 

""Oh."" Way for Lzi to be teh smrt. One handed, she opens it up, revealing that lovely tunic, and once again, she has to fake enthusiasm for the present. ""Thank you so much! I'll wear this to bed tonight, and you can wear the pajamas that I bought for you!"" Because night time is the only time Lzi will be seen wearing that particular tunic. However, it's then that Lzi's eyes land on B'ane, a smile quickly spreading over her lips. ""Hey Lilly, look who it is,"" she says, pointing the girl in his direction. Linnau also comes out to run toward the bronzerider, while the greenrider simply stands, shifting Lykane once again while she waits for the girls to be finished with their attack on him.

Lilly abruptly shakes her head, ""No mummy. You have to wear it tomorrow so everyone can see it!"" Gnhe. And then there's a B'ane. A shy look is casted towards the man before she wrinkles her face and... sits. On the ground. Huh.

B'ane is cultural, it shows in a new pair of white leather leggings with a hemp drawstring. His torso is more breathable in some sort of brown fabric that looks like a more common equivalent to silk. ""Hey girls,"" smiling tentatively. Prying his tinted glasses off his face with a risked free hand, B'ane tries to slide a small stack of packages onto a clothes trunk. 

Well, if Lilly doesn't go to see him, then it's just Linnau, hugging his leg tightly. Lilly gets a raspberry before Linny runs off again to play with her dollies. And now it's Lzi's turn to greet the man, and she's definitely about to do it properly. Without crushing Lykane, he gets a hug and a lingering kiss before she turns her attention back on Lilly. ""C'mon sweetie. Are't you happy to see B'ane?""

Lilly squirms at the raspberry, reaching out to whack her sister for doing so. Her mother's inquiry is met with a quick roll of her shoulders before leaning back against her hands. At least there's a dolly nearby. It's stared at before Lilly looks back up to mention, ""Mommy was sad that you were gone forever.""

B'ane makes to slip his glasses into the pocket that's not there. Catching himself, they are carefully set onto a glow basket for safe keeping. And just in time. ""Linnau, you are way past my knees,"" striken by the girl's height. He favors Lzi's reception, only parting quickly to see his son. ""And you almost reach to them."" The tall man smothers the greenrider's shoulder with a hand before it falls as he approaches Lilly, ""I didn't plan on being gone forever nor do I want to."" 

""Lilly,"" Lzi says to her daughter in a scolding tone of voice. ""I was sad, and you were too. But he's back now, and there's no reason to be sad anymore."" The packages are then eyed by her, turning excited eyes to B'ane. ""And what are /thoooose/?"" Give her presents. But first, Lykane is offered to him, just in case he cares to hold their son, who definitely has put on some weight and a few inches.

Lilly can't accept that so easily. She cants her head back and then to the side, asking ""How come you didn't come back home then?"" Everything's an option. ""Mommy was lonely but that's okay 'cause we had a party and it was fun cause everyone was there. Daddy was there!"" And then? ""Mommy, where was Trist? How come Trist wasn't there?"" She's only now realizing this? Interesting. And having selective hearing, it seems. Kids are great like that.

B'ane lifts Lykane under his arms. The baby is held high to that their eyes are even in height. ""He has more hair, darker too."" The man touches his forehead to his infant son's brow and cushions him upright in one capable arm. ""I could have come back for visits, you're right,"" vindicating Lilly's intelligent idea. ""But by staying in Southern all the time I got more work done so I could come home quicker."" A pair of knees bend closer to Lilly's level. ""Did you know I named that island after you?"" 

""I don't know, sweetie. He must've been busy."" Or Lzi didn't bother to tell N'ano and Tristan about the party. Of course, that bit of information is kept from Lilly. ""We'll go tomorrow and see him, okay? We'll bring Linny with us."" So she can have some quality time with her brother. The comments about Lykane gets a broad smile from Lzi, turning eyes upon their son. ""He's looking more like you by the day."" She lets Lilly and B'ane have a little bonding time while Lzi goes and pokes around the packages, waving her look-alike Linnau to join her.

Lilly cants her head in the other direction now, ""So are you home for good now?"" So mommy can stop complaining? Ahem. At the mention of naming something after her, eyes go wide, jaw drops and then... eyes narrow. ""Nuh uh."" 'cause that's /so/ too cool to be actually true. But then it's time to move onto bigger and better things. ""It's my turnday."" Still. It can last a sevenday long, can't it? ""Did you get me anything?"" That will be the ultimate test.

Eyes slide. ""Hey hey hey!"" B'ane and Lykane shift quickly to cut off Lzi and Linnau's snooping. A hand slaps against the top package. ""This one is yours,"" he allows Lzi to possess a small basket made of woven palm fronds. ""And,"" because he didn't know Linnau was going to be here, he allots Lilly's. ""This bracelet is for you, Linnau. You get a necklace,"" offering it to Lilly. ""And,"" peering at a set of earrings and improvising, ""you can each wear one?"" All are made of carved violet quahog-like shells. ""You don't believe me? Go check the map on Aboleoth."" B'ane points his head that way to tempt Lilly.

""Oooh!"" Lzi squeals in delight at the basket, and Linnau definitely does the same with her bracelet, quickly slipping it on her wrist. Lzi goes off to find a place to put her new basket, leaving Linnau to wrap her arms around B'ane's legs once again. ""Thank you!"" the girl says to the much, much taller man, and then she goes to show it off to Lilly. ""Mine is prettier than yours is!"" Always a sisterly competition. When Lzi returns, Lilly gets a hair ruffle. ""Gee, you're special. I don't have an island named after me."" And she's his weyrmate. Imagine that.

Lilly sways slightly, on the verge of proving B'ane wrong, but reconsiders in favor of examining her new necklace. ""Can you put it on me?"" she asks politely, standing up to hand the necklace back to the man. ""I'm five now."" In case he was in the dark about that. ""Mommy says I can go to the harpers soon."" Meanwhile, Linnau's about to get the claw for her little comment. ""Nuh uh! You're stupid!"" Can you feel the love?

B'ane experiments by bouncing Lykane once to gauge his reaction. He looks neither amused nor upset. B'ane stops. ""Certainly, ma'am."" B'ane crouches, grinning after Linnau, leaning the baby against his abdomen while big fingers try their best on a tiny clasp. ""Harpers, huh? They are very respected all over Pern."" The clasp taunts him. Repeatedly. ""Perhaps your mother can help with this. Lzi?""  

""Linnau. Lilly. Stop,"" Lzi says to both girls, giving them equally stern glares. ""They're both beautiful pieces of jewelry, and you should be thankful that B'ane got you anything at all."" At his request, she nods, kneeling down behind Lilly to clasp the necklace around her neck, and it only takes a moment before it's in place. ""There. Now why don't you and Linny go play with your new dollies?"" And give Lzi some time alone with B'ane. He gets a grin as she sighs, pushing herself to stand. ""See all of the fun you missed around here,"" is said sarcastically, complete with an eyeroll.

Lilly lowers her chin to her chest while pulling the necklace as best as she can out in front of her. ""I can't see it now!"" But she doesn't whine for long before it's lowered in favor of the dolly on the floor. ""B'ane? Will you play dollies? Linnau's being mean and mommy won't.""

B'ane points one knee under him before standing. Because he starts fussing Lykane is held backwards facing Lzi, the more familiar parent. He scratches irritatingly at the portion of hemp rope touching his bare skin. ""I know now why these were a bargain,"" murmured. Lilly's request makes the bronzerider think. ""I can. Let me take Aboleoth's straps off him first so he may hunt.""   

Lykane is taken back into her arms, placing a soothing kiss on his head. Even if B'ane agreed to playing with Lilly, Lzi seems more hesitant. ""Why don't we let B'ane get settled back in, huh? I'm sure he just wants to relax tonight, and he has all day tomorrow that he can play dollies with you."" Not that Lzi knows his schedule. Sometimes lying is necessary with children. Plus, Lzi wants her own special time with him.
Lilly raises her brows at her mother before challenging with ""Then /you/ play with me."" There is no other alternative. She'll even get the arm-crossing thing going on. Yeah, she means business.

B'ane brushes his hands together as Lykane is taken from him. He believes himself too recently 'new' to the picture to yet infringe upon the colliding family dynamic. ""I'll be right back."" He makes an easy escape, but it won't last long.

With B'ane temporarily gone, it allows Lzi to really unleash her tongue on Lilly. ""No, I won't play with you. Look. Mommy was lonely while B'ane was gone. Now that B'ane's back, mommy wants to spend some time with him. So why don't you go and play with Linnau, and I /promise/ you that tomorrow, B'ane and I will play with you all afternoon, okay?""

Lilly unleashes the screech. ""NO!"" And she'll even stomp her feet like all good children do. ""I hate you!"" Alas, the rebellion begins. And the throwing in inanimate objects.

""Hey!"" Shielding Lykane from the trajectory, Lzi turns a pointed finger and a glare onto Lilly. ""Stop it. That's dangerous. Lykane is just a baby, and if you hit him, it could really hurt him."" Nevermind the fact that Lilly hates her mother. Just protect the baby. ""Go play,"" is Lzi's next attempt at getting her daughter to go away.

Lilly stomps her feet again, ""I DON'T CARE! I HATE HIM! He's stupid!"" Lykane? Oh. So the jealous older-sister bit's finally coming out. ""You always spend all your time playing with him and not me!"" Aww.

""Lilly,"" Lzi says with a hint of a sigh, shaking her head slightly. ""I can't help it. Sweetheart, he's a baby. He needs me. And I know that you need me too, but he /really/ needs me. He can't eat like you eat. He can't even walk. I'm sorry if I pay a lot of attention to him, but I play with you a lot, too."" Sometimes.

Lilly shakes her head, ""No you don't! You hate me!"" And that's the fact that Lilly's resigned to. ""I wanna go to daddy's."" Because he plays dolls with her? Probably.

That's enough to get Lzi to go and place Lykane in his cradle so that she can kneel in front of Lilly, placing her hands on her tiny hips. ""Lilly. I do /not/ hate you. Okay? I love you /so/ much, sweetie. So so much. You're my baby girl, and you mean the world to me, so don't ever think that I hate you.""

Lilly's lip trembles as tears start filling her eyes. ""No you don't. You hate me 'cause if you liked me then you'd play with me but you're always too tired to play with me!"" But at least she's kind enough to cling to her mother's form. And where's Linnau through all of this? Probably rolling her eyes in the corner. ""You're right mom. She /is/ a baby."" Yeah, that's her comment from the peanut gallery.

Linnau is ignored, and rightly so. Lzi sighs, holding tightly onto Lilly as she considers what to say to try and make her feel better. ""Lilly, I have /three/ kids. Three. I have to take care of you, Linnau, and Lykane. Mommy gets tired a lot because she has a lot of responsibilities. But now that I know how you feel, I promise that I'll play with you more. Really.""
Lilly has either accepted Lzi's promise, or has run out of steam since she has no immediate response. Finally, she pulls back, holding up a pinky, ""Promise?""

Lzi grins, holding up her own pinky and locking it with Lilly's. ""Promise."" But. There's always a but. ""But you also have a sister you can play with now when I can't.""

Lilly shakes her head, ""She doesn't like to play with me cause she thinks I'm a baby."" Well, maybe that was before. We'll see if Linnau's reformed now.
""Well, then you need to show her that you're not a baby. She /is/ older than you, after all. She likes different things. But she's your sister and she loves you. And I know that you love her. You know, I don't have any sisters. I only have brothers, so I'm jealous that you have such a great sister.""
Lilly cants her head for a moment before asking, ""How come Linnie and me have different daddies?"" Oh boy. ""Trist says that his mommy--he said that him and Emma and--and Allie and all the rest of them are from--they have the same daddy.""

Oh boy indeed. How to approach that topic. Lzi takes a deep breath before diving in. ""Well, mommy has loved a lot of men. Linnau and Tristan are actually brother and sister. They have the sames daddy. N'ano. And then you have your daddy. And B'ane is Lykane's daddy. You are all very special, even if you have different daddies."" Even if that is dancing around the topic.
Lilly's face scrunches up at the fact that she's ""dating"" her sister's brother. Woah boy. ""How come you don't live Linnie's daddy anymore? And how come you don't love daddy"" her's, presumably ""anymore?""

""I still love them. Very much. But it's different now. I love B'ane more, and that's why I'm with him. Linnau's daddy has someone that he loves, and your daddy has Shazi.""

Lilly isn't about to stop the ball from rolling. ""How come daddy hasn't had any babies with Shazi? But that's okay cause I don't want him to have anymore babies. He plays with me all the time and if he has a baby he'll play with the baby more."" Drawing from Lzi's example, of course.

""Shazi doesn't want to have babies right now, sweetie."" At least that's what Lzi remembers Il'ad telling her. ""Maybe someday you'll have a brother and sister. How do you feel about me having another baby?"" Lzi questions Lilly, a brow raising, testing the waters in that area.

Lilly gives Lzi's shoulder a light whack. ""No more! Lykane's still a baby and if you have another baby then you won't take care of him and he'll /die/."" Well, at least Lilly has -some- compassion towards the welfare of her brother, anyway.

""Well, not another baby right /now/."" Because B'ane definitely wouldn't be all about that. ""But maybe in a few turns. Lykane will be older then, and he won't need me so much. Wouldn't you like another brother or sister?""

Lilly shakes her head. ""No."" Plain and simple. ""Trist has like, seven gazillion billion brothers and sisters and he doesn't like it. He only likes a couple of them. If you have another, then you'll play with me less.""
Corsair> Sadi has connected.

Lzi drops that topic, if only because, honestly, she just doesn't care what Lilly has to say about it. More babies are definitely in the future. ""I'll always play with you, Lil. Someday, you'll be twenty turns old, and I'll still play with you.""

Lilly shakes her head yet again, ""No, cause by then, I'll have thirty babies."" Thirty, got that? ""So I won't have time to play with you, mommy."" Tough toenails.

""Excuse me? Thirty babies?"" Yeah, Lzi needs that one explained.
Lilly nods her head, ""Thirty."" Really, there's no explanation for that. It is as it is.

""So, I can't have another baby, but you plan to give me thirty grandchildren by the time you're twenty?""

Lilly nods, beaming brightly. ""Uh huh, but don't worry. You don't have to have more kids cause I'll have them and you have to spoil them cause that's what grammy's do."" Like her own grammy.

Well, it gets Lzi laughing. At first. Then the reality that someday she'll actually be a grandmother hits her, causing her to sit down flat on her butt, a stunned look on her face. ""Wow."" And that's all she has to say about that.

Lilly reaches out to hit Lzi's shoulder again. ""I'm just kidding mommy. I'll have twenty. That's it. And we'll play house all day. And dollies. And I'll get handfasted to Trist and we can live together. And Linnie can live with us cause she's his sister.""

Whoawhoawhoa. That pulls Lzi out of her stupor. ""You plan on getting handfastened to /Tristan/?"" Meaning Lzi and N'ano will be in-laws or something. ""Sweetie, you're only five. You have plenty of time to find a husband.""

Lilly shrugs, ""I know but I love him."" Because children know what love him. ""I love him as much as you and daddy."" Ah. ""And he loves me. Can I sleep over there tomorrow? He wants me to.""

That also delivers a blow to Lzi, and the strain wears on her face, brows wrinkling together. ""Huhwhat? Uh, we'll talk about that tomorrow. If N'ano says you can stay there, I'll consider it.""

Lilly beams, reaching out to hug Lzi again. ""Linnie can come too if she stops calling me a baby. He lets me play with his canine.""
Aww. Hugs. Those are always nice. ""I don't know. We'll see. I get the feeling you and her will get into a fight, and I don't want N'ano to have to break up a fight between you two. Plus, what about me? I'll be lonely here all by myself,"" and here, Lzi pulls out a pouty lip.

Lilly shrugs, ""B'ane's here. You won't be lonely."" You move it you lose it. Or something like that. ""I'll make you something when I'm down there,"" she then reassures her, nodding once.

Ooh. Some alone time with B'ane is enough to get Lzi nodding, looking more encouraging about the idea. ""All right. But you two /have/ to behave yourselves, okay? I hear a bad report from N'ano, and you aren't sleeping over again, you hear me?""

Lilly reconsiders, ""I can stay though if you really need me,"" she offers, resigning with a quick lift of her shoulders and a light sigh. ""I don't mind. Tristan can stay here instead!"" Now -there's- a novel idea.

""Nononono, you and Linny can go and stay over at Tristan's. The next time he can stay here, how about that?"" Funny how Lzi's opinion about that switched so suddenly.

Lilly wrinkles her face again, ""Is that cause you and B'ane wanna have sex?"" Yeah, don't think she forgot about all of that.

Don't mind the flush that rises to Lzi's cheeks. ""Don't say that word again, Lilly. It's a bad word, and I'll have to tell your father if you keep saying it."" Let him deal with it.

Lilly is just prompted to repeat it with that reprimand. ""Sex! Sex sex sex sex SEX!"" she hoots and hollars, prancing about.

Surprisingly, it gets Lzi laughing, shaking her head at Lilly. ""You /are/ my daughter,"" she mutters, grinning at she watches the prancing.

Lilly stops at that, staring, ""I wasn't before?"" And then her expression droops. ""Am I adopted, mommy?""

""Oh no, sweetie. I just meant that as in you're just like me,"" Lzi reassures Lilly, reaching out to give her a hug. ""You are definitely my daughter, and you're /not/ adopted.""

Lilly is reassured. ""Oh. Is Linnau your daughter?"" It's always good to be completely sure, afterall. And then she lets out a wicked yawn. ""Can I have a sweetstick?"" to keep her going?

""Linnau is my daughter,"" Lzi replies with a nod, ""and Lykane is my son. You're all mine."" Whether she likes it or not. ""No, no sweetsticks. It's bedtime soon, and you'll be up all night if you have a sweetstick now.""
Lilly pouts, but considers something else, ""Juice?"" And then she'll be up peeing all night. ""Mommy I'm hungry."" Feed her. And then she'll grow. And then she'll eat her family. Or something.

""No,"" Lzi says firmly, shaking her head. ""You know the rules, Lilly."" Apparently, there are rules to bedtime. ""No juice either. How about you go and put your new pajamas on, huh? Show me how pretty you look in them.""

Lilly can be just as difficult. ""No,"" she easily protests while sitting back on the ground.

""Fine."" Lzi stands, walking over to check on Lykane in his cradle. Fell sleep. Huh. With that, the greenrider starts picking up dirty clothes off of the floor, throwing them into a pile.
Lilly will just play with her dollies all night until Lzi becomes more forceful. Yep.

For some reason, Lzi's tolerance is high, and even the doll throwing doesn't bother her. To distract herself, she hums a happy tune.

Lilly flops over and dies. ...or doesn't die, but pretends to be dead because dead people at least get attention and she's just an attention whore, it seems. Wonder who she gets it from. Ahem.

Eventually, Lzi reaches her boiling point, and Lilly is scooped up off of the floor. ""That's enough Lilly."" And since she won't put her pajamas on by herself, her mother starts taking off her clothes.

Lilly will just have to flail to be difficult. ""I. Don't. Want. To!"" And what Lilly says always goes. Flail flail flail.

Child Protection Services peeps in from the ledge.

Struggling, Lilly's shirt is pulled off, and Lzi works on her pants next. ""I don't care what you want. You're putting your pajamas on, and that's /final/."" 

Lilly huffs, ""Fine, but I'm not going to bed."" So who's really winning this battle?

""Oh yes you are."" Pants are off, and now Lzi has to put pajamas on Lilly's body. That should be fun. ""If you don't go to bed, you aren't sleeping over at Tristan's."" A-ha.

Lilly stops flailing. She even shuts up. Instead, she'll just go limp. Yeah, see if Lzi can get those things on over dead weight.

Lzi may not be strong, but she is definitely stronger than a five turn old. It takes some effort, but eventually, Lilly's pajamas are put on her body, and Lzi sets her up, giving her a playful swat on the butt. ""Bedtime.""

Lilly purses her lips together, shaking his head. ""I'm not sle--"" Just ignore the yawn that interrupts that statement. She quickly turns it into a cough as best as she can. Clever!

""Uh huh."" Lzi grins, giving Lilly a kiss to the head before standing, pushing her toward their bed area. ""Bedtime, sweetie. You better get a full night's sleep so that we can play tomorrow with B'ane, remember?""

Lilly shakes her head, ""You're gonna forget,"" she tells Lzi straight out, but complies with bedtime regardless. ""He'll forget too."" Aww.

""Hey."" Lzi actually puts herself in front of Lilly, kneeling down in front of her once again to look her in the eyes. ""I pinky-swore. That means I really promise. B'ane and I will play dollies with you tomorrow. I mean it.""

Lilly shakes her head, ""You only pinky swore that you'd play with me more, but not that you'd play with me tomorrow,"" she reminds her as she turns to climb onto her bed. ""Can you get me Gabbie?"" Must be one of her dollies. But which?

""Uh, sure."" Lzi's weyr looks like a dolly graveyard. They're everywhere. One that looks like a Gabbie is picked up and given to to Lilly. ""Good night, sweetie.""

Lilly sits up, pouting. ""Mommy, that's not Gabbie."" Try again. At least her finger waggles towards the -right- dolly, which is really just at the foot of her bed.

""Oh. Sorry."" That dolly is cast to the side, and Lzi picks up, hopefully, Gabbie, and hands her over to Lilly.

Lilly is at least grateful since after she snatches the dolly from Lzi, she says ""Good night, mommy,"" and even leans forward to give the woman a quick smooch. ""Love you mommy."" Aww.

""I love you too, sweetie. /Sooooo/ much."" Lzi grins down at Lilly for a moment before going in for another kiss, this one much sweeter, softer, and lingering. ""Sweet dreams."""

Lzi's Wild Love Shack
Dramatically high and carved out of a beautifully light wood, a bed piled high with pink pillows and blankets is set against the farthest wall, the first focus upon entering. Directly infront from the bed is a small, oddly shaped white fur with pillows thrown on top of it, which is aptly named a pillow couch. Near the pillow couch is a large cabinet made of the same wood color as the bed, completely packed with an impressive variety and supply of alcohol, and near the cabinet is a white couch. On the other side of the room is a desk and a dresser, made out of the same light wood as the rest of the furniture. Near the desk is a curtained exit, leading into a small closet area containing... [look closer]
  It is an autumn sunset.  
You see Moldy Egg Moronth, Bramble bush, Abstract Woman Sculpture, Lilly, and Lykane here.
Lzi is here.
Obvious exits:
Ledge     Spa

The weyr is silent, which could mean a various number of things. However, on this occassion, the weyr is silent because Lykane is sleeping on Lzi's bed, with her laying next to him, just watching him sleep. So peaceful. The greenrider's eyes, though, are doing a dancing act, slowly drifting shut before flying open, only to drift shut again. Eyes are then forced widely open, and afterwards, Lzi leans over to place a soft kiss on her son before standing to start folding clothes that are piling up around her weyr in an attempt to keep herself awake.

Izlasth's ledge gains a visitor who deposits himself with a single salvo that is more felt than heard. Aboleoth. B'ane scrapes his sandals clean before entering the weyr as both an unobtrusive precautionary warning of entrance and strive for clean feet. His clothes and salty skin from earlier in the day have given way to a laundered man in pale linen. Electra grips a shoulder, but the man tolerates the press of claws into his skin so long as he doesn't move much. 

""Hey honey,"" is Lzi's greeting as she looks up from folding one of Lykane's many new blankets, offering her weyrmate a tired smile. The clothes given to them as gifts for the newborn are next on the greenrider's list to put away. ""Did you get Romel situated in the barracks? I would've stayed to help out, but..."" A glance is given to Lykane, who's awake now but keeps quiet. ""I don't think sunburns are good for babies.""

B'ane folds his arms around Lzi from behind, one hand binding to the other's wrist in a loose lock. A kiss for the hollow of her throat. ""He's all situated. I think he'll make a very good candidate. And no, you did well to get Lykane out of the sun."" The 'lock' around the woman is broken as B'ane hovers over his son. ""You both look tired,"" peering upwards.

""I'm exhausted,"" Lzi admits as a hand rubs one of her eyes. A blue outfit is folded and placed among the dozens of other blue outfits gifted to them for Lykane. ""I mean, not that he stays up all night screaming or anything, but he does wake up a couple times during the night to be fed or to be changed, and it's the broken sleep that's really getting to me."" That and Lzi's been getting up early to workout, but this isn't mentioned for good reason. It's her turn now to wrap her arms around B'ane from behind, resting her head on his back. ""You been sleeping okay?""

B'ane nudges the blanket a little higher on the baby for paternal securities, not exactly the infant's. ""Sometimes. I guess turns of Aboleoth has helped me block out some stuff, but I feel bad I can't do more. It's not exactly like I can feed him for you,"" a realistic frown as he maneuvers an arm to catch Lzi. 

""I know, love. I know. But I'm appreciative of what you /do/ do. I mean, you burp him for me."" Not that that's a particularly difficult task, but judging by the smile Lzi tosses up to her weyrmate, it means everything to her. ""When he gets older, you'll be able to do more. I'm sure he won't leave your side when he's old enough to walk."" A content sigh comes from the greenrider as eyes fall on Lykane once again. ""I swear he gets cuter by the day. I never knew it was possible to love something so little so much.""

B'ane guides Lzi to a sector of her bed that won't disturb Lykane if they sit down. ""Ughn don't talk about walking, I kind of like having him completely and utterly portable. At least he stays where you put him. That won't last long."" B'ane looks the proper side of mildly amused. ""Hmmm."" Smitten with Lzi's last comment. Then, ""what if I took him to my weyr tonight and see if you can get a better night's sleep? He'll probably have an early feeding though."" Speculating.

Lzi settles herself gently down on the bed, tossing a quick glance over to the baby before resting her head on B'ane's shoulder, if only for a moment. ""You mean, you keep him for the night in your weyr while I sleep here?"" A brow raises as her eyes meet his. ""If you want to. I just don't want you to have a bad night's sleep, that's all. If either of us should be exhausted, it should be me. I'm yonger, afterall."" A smirk accompanies her words as she nudges her weymate playfully.

B'ane pretends for a second to look defensive, eyebrows going down. ""In body maybe."" Back his brows ascend to normal altitude and he grins unsymmetrically while looking at the sleeping bairn. ""We're both his parents so we should both be martyrs for parenthood.""

""What if,"" Lzi drawls out while watching her fingers intertwine with B'ane's, ""we all sleep together somewhere as one big happy family? I'll get up to feed him, but if he just needs changed or to be held for awhile, you can get up and do that. It doesn't seem fair for one of us to be well rested while the other is exhausted. If you're going to be tired, then I should be, too.""

B'ane stretches his heel tendons by raising and lowering his feet while Lzi summons a compromise. ""Deal, mother."" It's a new moniker that's being tried out, one that deserves some sort of a smile that B'ane deviously withholds. ""So you refused the nursemaid suggestion?""

""Okay, father."" Though Lzi isn't as good hiding her smile from B'ane at the title. ""Yeah. I mean, I thought about it, but just the thought of someone else nursing him..."" Lzi lets the sentence fade off with a shake of her head. ""I'm his mother. I should be the one nursing him. Plus, it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be."" Her smile softens as dark eyes fall upon Lykane, head tilting to the side. ""It's silly because he's technically my fourth child, but I feel like a first time mother. I'm worried I'm doing everything all wrong.""

B'ane brings Lzi's clasped hand to his lap. ""Someone, maybe it was D'baji, said that you can't do an honest wrong if you're trying to do right. In the worse sense of the term we'll be terrible parents together."" Somewhere in that voice humor is dying to escape. Electra has worked her way over to the bed, four feet sinking into the mattress as she glimpses Lykane. B'ane watches, but is not alarmed.

Thankfully, Lzi senses the humor in B'ane's words, and it gets a light chuckle out of her. Electra is watched by her, but it's with a smile. ""What does everyone on your side think of him? Aboleoth, your firelizards? I bet it's all new for them, huh? Even Izlasth is curious of him. Keeps sniffing him. Lilly loves him."" That gets Lzi to roll her eyes just slightly. ""I thought I was smitten with him. All Lilly wants to do all day is hold him. She wants to be his mom, I swear.""

B'ane's yellow firelizard smells the baby's back and looks questioningly up at B'ane with a negociable cheep. He crooks a finger under Electra's jaw and wiggles a sloppy caress. ""They seem curious definitely. Nemesis flees from the screams although he wouldn't harm him I'm sure. And Aboleoth."" B'ane fights for an adequate description. ""He's anxious to communicate with him. I can't explain the virtue of patience to him, that humans take many years to gradually gain function.""  

""Izlasth, too. Though, I think she already talks to him, even if he doesn't understand. I know she talks to Lilly, but neither of them ever tell me what they talk about."" Lzi rolls her eyes once again, and, confident that the firelizard won't harm the baby, she turns her attention back to her weyrmate. ""I never had the chance to ask you. Are you happy we had a boy? Or are you itching to try again to see if we can have a girl?"" Perhaps the latter part better describes Lzi.

B'ane swallows before talking, Adam's apple resettling after a quick bob. His eyes remain on his firelizard out of hunger for movement. ""To tell you the truth I was nervous about either option. On one hand, try to relate to a little girl and on the other, how to live up to a boy's expectations.""

""You worry too much."" Leaning over, a kiss is placed on B'ane cheek, Lzi remaining close by afterwards. ""So, I know it's a little early to be thinking about this but..."" Oh, how to approach it. ""Can you see yourself wanting another one at some point?""

""I'm not sure. My trial period isn't yet up with the first one."" Seriousness then replaces the droll attitude. ""I would like to devote myself fully to him, I can't say how long. I want to know everything, see."" He explains his grand ambitions with a clever smirk.

Lzi bobs her head, though it's hard for her to hide the frown that pulls the corners of her lips downward. ""I was just curious. I know I don't want him to be my last. I'd at least would like one more. I was just curious as to what your opinion on the matter was, that's all."" Arms aching to hold their precious bundle, Lzi soon rises to scoop Lykane up, returning shortly thereafter to sitting next to B'ane. ""Maybe he should get a brother, since he already has two sisters.""

B'ane extends his left arm around Lzi's back to secure her place beside him once she resumes her seat. ""I understand."" Effectively not writing the conclusion on that one. A large hand cups itself around his little boy's head, barely ruffling the silky hair found there. ""I think one of my grandmother's might have had blondish hair,"" trying to explain genetics.

Lzi's frown only continues to grow at the mention of Lykane's looks, since it's obviously something she's noticed but failed to mention.  ""I don't think I can have babies that look like me anymore."" But at least she has an excuse. ""Lilly looked nothing like me when she was born, or Il'ad for that matter, but as she's gotten older, she's starting to look more like us. I can only hope that that's the case with him. I just wish I knew where the blue eyes came from. No one on my side has blue eyes. We all have brown.""

B'ane's thumb makes a repeating course, gently, over the small boy's brow. He nods, consenting to Lzi's description of her family that suits his as well. ""I think it's kind of... great. That he has his own looks about him."" And to knife doubts, the bronzerider hurries a stare to Lzi and a quiet murmur. ""I know he's mine.""

A heavy burden has been lifted off of Lzi, and to show that, she releases a loud sigh. There's no words that seem appropriate, so the only reply B'ane gets to his last statement is a look, a nod, and a slight grin. Resting her head against his shoulder, Lzi continues to stare down at Lykane, who is blissfully unaware of everything around him. ""Thank you. Thank you for giving him to me. To us. I love this. I love having you two as my family. My two handsome boys. You two are all I need.""

B'ane cannot say anything that a kiss could not capture quite as succinctly. Or efficiently. After, he drags his tongue along his lower lip and gently pushes off the bed. ""I'm going to grab something from my weyr and then I'm coming back. I forgot it although it was on my mind the whole time."" Explaining his lapse to the east section of Lzi's weyr as he walks.

There's a laugh, a confused one, for B'ane's statements, but Lzi nods, eyes following him as he stands. ""All right. I think I'm gonna feed him, then you can have the honor of burping and changing him."" Two things that she doesn't particularly like doing. ""Say bye to daddy."" A tiny hand of Lykane's is raised and made to wave to his father before Lzi does the same. ""Bring some of your clean tunics with you. I don't think I have any here."" And she is known to steal them to wear.

B'ane pauses to catch Lzi's request. Caught. ""Clean? Okay, I'll look."" Far easier to cast off the old and don the new, the Maverick might have the laundresses doing overtime once a month. ""And something to eat. I'm dying here."" It doesn't take long for him to be swallowed up at the cave's entrance."

Central Bowl
  Looking toward the sky from the center of Ista Weyr's bowl, you view the five towering pinnacles of the Weyr rim that appear to reach into the clouds. The bowl floor slopes gently upward to the southeast, where various tunnels lead to the hatching grounds, ground weyrs, and living caverns. Across the bowl to the northeast are the weyrling barracks and training grounds. The Weyr's artificial waterfall sheets down along the northern wall of the Bowl, its pool concealed at the base of the bowl by a cloud of mist. West, the entire wall of the bowl has been blown out by some long-distant eruption, offering a breathtaking view of the ocean.
  It is an autumn noon.  
Gliding about are six firelizards.
You see Abbaeth (NPC) and Rhapsody here.
Romel is here.
Obvious exits:
Northeastern Bowl     Plateau     Southeastern Bowl

Such a nice place to hang around during the day, especially on one's break. Romel is in the wide expanse of the central bowl, a satchel by his feet, and two firelizards - a bronze and a gold - circling overhead. The boy fumbles with something in his hands, tying twine around a chunk of ... meat? Once he's finished and looking satisfied, he shades his eyes as he looks upward at the two firelizards, pitching a whistle before he tosses the meat up and starts swinging the twine above his head. It's only moments before the smaller bronze swoops down and makes a pass for the meat, missing just as the gold follows on his heels and clutches it to her chest with a smug cry.

High above, Izlasth takes off from Izlasth's ledge.
Above, Izlasth descends from above.
Above, Izlasth lands in the central bowl.

Lzi slides from Izlasth's neck and lands gently on the ground.

B'ane jaunts up the plateau, steps fixed and roughly the same measure even when making the climb uphill. He wears thin off white pants and only a light vest, tied on the bottom, over his skin. A pair of rudimentary sunglasses shield his eyes from the sun, but they constantly slide down due to sweat accumulation. A small brown firelizard, further ahead in progress, has stumbled onto the scene with Romel and quickly figures out the style of 'play.' He begins to participate, speed increasing around the metallic kin.

With a bundle held tightly to her chest, Lzi gently dismounts off of Izlasth, making sure not to jostle baby Lykane in her arms. Since he's still sleeping, it looks like she did a good job, so she starts walking away from her dragon and toward a destination unknown. Romel and his firelizards catch Lzi's attention first, getting a smile to appear on her lips, but B'ane soon steals her eyes away from the scene. ""Hey,"" is called out to her weyrmate, loud enough but not too loud. Don't want to wake the baby, after all. ""We were just coming to find you.""

Romel's gaze flicks towards the landing green, swinging another piece of meat into the air for the bronze who missed out the first time around. The gold has already taken her prize down to the grass and is happily chirping as she tears away at it. Curiosity getting the better of him, Romel's distraction causes his twirling meat to falter and almost hit the bronze, who blinks between to miss getting hit, reappearing a few feet away with /very/ indignant squawking on his part.

B'ane gives life to wet hair with a sweep of a hand, but the locks quickly fall back over his forehead and a bit past the upper rim of his eyewear. It takes him a bit of time to reach Izlasth, but Nemesis isn't easily letting him forget Romel. Lzi and the newborn collect kisses on their foreheads. While still hovering close, ""you shouldn't be outside in the heat."" The folly of Romel's bronze is Nemesis' benefit. Ever agile, the meat on the string is his to capitalize on. 

""We won't be out here long. I was just going to the caverns to grab a bite to eat, and he's just along for the ride,"" Lzi replies to B'ane, glancing down at their son before her eyes once again go toward Romel and his firelizards. ""Looks like they're having a good time over there, huh? Who knew a person could make feeding firelizards so fun?"" For now, she watches.

It's a second before Romel realizes that a strange bronze took advantage of the meat, and he gives Nemesis a stupid look before flailing his hands at him. ""Hey! That's Demy's! Bad brown, no!"" Yeah, because that'll totally work. Adding insult to injury, little bronze Demyx just flaps furiously overhead as he watches his meal go down the other's gullet. Romel sighs, giving a grunt before he whistles at his bronze, who lands on his arm with such a depressing posture, the stablehand takes pity on him and hands him a chunk of meat from his satchel. Overhearing a few of Lzi's words, he looks up and just says, ""Excercise!"" Well, it's exercise when he's not a) almost hitting his own firelizard, and b) not feeding some strange one who happens to come along...

B'ane's dainty brown eats on the wing, concentrating on wolfing the piece down whole after negligible amounts of chewing. His flight becomes erratic as the meat works its way down, but quickly his thin wings level out to more normal standards. He continues to fly high over the head of the young man, ignoring the stranger's insults if he will still provide food. ""Creative."" He smiles slightly to his weyrmate and starts to walks towards Romel's direction.

Where ever B'ane goes, Lzi follows, so she's close behind him in walking toward Romel. ""Izlasth says she wishes that she was little so that she could play,"" she says to both the bronzerider and Romel, grinning as she shifts Lykane in her arms. He gets heavy, for as little as he is. ""How in Faranth's name did you ever think of doing that for them?""

Romel looks up at Nemisis with a half-hearted scowl, assuming that the brown is the assistant weyrlingmaster's by default. He offers a lop-sided grin to the pair of dragonriders, ""They don't do much during the day besides sleep on my bed like big, fat felines, so I just had to figure out somethin' to get them up and about so they don't get too hefty to fly."" His cheeks redden slightly, suddenly aware that the attention is on him. ""I've tried to train them for messaging, but I think they're a bit dense for it. Never get to the right person.""

B'ane pushes his sunglasses high once again as he comes to a soft stop. In a subtle, but meaningful baritone, ""beauty is sometimes the trade-off for brains,"" remarking on the youth's comment. ""Or mischief."" He need not cock a glance at his firelizard. ""But you've made other successes."" It's hard to tell exactly where the bronzerider's eyes lay behind his tinted glasses, but Romel would be a safe bet.

""Well, at least you tried to do /something/ with them."" Lzi hasn't tried to do anything with hers except feed them, though somehow or another, they haven't gotten fat. Faranth only knows what they do while she's not looking.  A hand idly rubs at Lykane's back in an attempt to keep him from fussing. ""He's clever,"" she comments to B'ane, narrowing her eyes slightly at him as if trying to convey a thought to him.

""If you can call air-hunting a success,"" Romel says with an amused tone, glancing at Demyx on his arm. Ender, the gold who successfully got the first piece of meat, now circles overhead with Nemisis. Romel looks embarassed at Lzi's comment, cheeks growing hot again. ""Oh, m'not clever, I've seen a group take down a wherry before near a gold's nest before, I figured maybe they'd like a little air-hunting.

""I'd like to see the person who could swing a herdbeast for /her/,"" tilting his head to where Izlasth remains. A half smile forms. ""Practical application is a form of cleverness. What is your name?"" Aboleoth's rider aligns himself to the sun so that he may partially shade Lzi and Lykane. 

Lzi laughs, turning her eyes to land on her dragon, who seems very interested in the firelizard game at the moment. ""If you could think of a way to do /that/, I think she'd be your friend forever,"" is commented to Romel after B'ane's comment, grinning. Now, the greenrider falls silent, waiting to hear the name of the clever one.

""Romel,"" the boy offers, and probably would hold a hand out if it weren't greasy with meat. ""I'm a stablehand here, Sorcha's nephew."" He considers both riders for a long moment, as if trying to recall details about them. ""You're ... B'ane, right? And Lizzie? I rememeber Sorcha telling me who the weyrlingmasters were.""

B'ane touches Lzi's forearm as a slow return sign. He nods once at the pronouncement of each of their names. ""How would becoming a candidate suit you, Romel?"" Spur of the moment B'ane can be on occasion. ""However, the runners may make better overseers. Candidacy is not easy, but may gross its own rewards.""

Hearing that Romel is a relation of Sorcha gets a nervous swallow from Lzi, but she just nods her head as he names her. As Lykane wakes up and starts to wiggle in her arms, Lzi shifts him once again to a new position, using him as an excuse to depart. ""I'm gonna take him inside. I think the heat is getting to him,"" is commented to B'ane as she takes a few initial steps toward the caverns. ""Come and find me when you're done."" To Romel, she offers as much of a wave as carrying a baby as allow. ""Nice to meet you, Romel. Have a good day."" And surely after being asked to be a candiate makes for a good day.

The housekeeper arrives to cart Lzi off to bed.

Completely missing B'ane's offer for candidacy, Romel looks a little worried after he drops his aunt's name, bidding farewell to Lzi as she takes her child inside. ""Was it something I said?"" he asks B'ane with concern before he blinks and realizes what the bronzerider just said. ""I, er, what? Are you serious?"" Cue a stupid stare from him.

B'ane's arm lingers briefly in the air, releasing, as the greenrider goes inside. ""Completely."" If his eyes weren't covered, one would find them creased with the effects of a tiny grin. ""But you are free to refuse."" Glasses are forced up again with notched fingers.

It's a good minute or so before Romel even gathers his sense to reply, jaw working as he searches for words. Finally, in very quick words, ""I'd be damn stupid to say no! My parents would be so proud! My dad's a Telgari rider, see. And Sorcha! Man, she'll be so excited. I-I mean, s'long as I still get to go to the stables every now and then... oh man, this is great."" With his excitement, you'd think that he just Impressed! He grins, still stupidly, at B'ane. ""Yes!""

Hands on his hips, B'ane looks satisfied. ""Good. Follow me."" Swinging a long leg towards a new path to the inside of the Weyr. ""You won't desire the stables long."" For that realm is included in candidate responsibility. Glad to be rid of the sun, B'ane's stride sets a good pace. Nemesis, however, is no where to be seen.

Romel whistles swiftly to Demyx, who takes off from his arm, both bronze and gold finding better things to do while their owner gathers his satchel and follows B'ane. ""'Course, sir!"" And he's after the bronzerider like a duckling."

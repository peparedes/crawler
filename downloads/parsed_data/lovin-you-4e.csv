My soul is forever tortured
Tortured with the pain in knowing you
With this breath
I'm forever sinned
Sinned with loving you
With this breath
I will take in the last of my pain
Pain becoming my life
With this breath
I will take in this moment
Moment of my goodbye
With this breath
This will be the end
End of you and me
With this breath
It will be my last
Last breath by me"

But i'm glad that I had Lee to talk to on the phone. That was comforting. Very much so. It was also nice to have an old friend around because he was very useful. We knew  having a guy here would be a good idea and we were right. I just feel bad. He could have died because of me. Mommy could have died. And of course Jay could have died.

"event","I'm amazed at much people can change. And though I'd love to be able to say it's for the best, i'd be simply lying. Cause it's not. People are assholes and I guess there's not much you can do about that. 

I have come to the decision that there's no point in trying anymore. I've gotten nowhere. It may seem like i'm not trying to you because you get IMs here and there, but I am. It's hard to throw myself out there completely when you could care less when I throw myself out there a little at a time. You can claim that you care, but your actions speak louder than your words. I know i've made my mistakes with you and i've apologized a million times. There's nothing else I can do. I was trying to be your friend. I wasn't trying to make you feel guilty. Where would that get me? Nowhere. I've always believed and trusted you. I told you that everyday. You just never believed me. And you know what, that's fine. I did things for my own reasons, they didn't always have to do with you. But it's done. I'm not going to keep trying if you're never going to let me in.

Here I thought everything was fine. I guess I was wrong. I tell you everything that's going on in my life that's worth mentioning. Now I don't go over every little conversation with you because they don't all matter. And I don't always remember every little detail. I never thought that I had to tell you every single person I talk to. I think that's a bit ridiculous. Why can't I just tell you the important things?

I'm tired of not being trusted. Of having my trust in someone betrayed. I'm tired of finding out that someone is going through my shit. This is getting old. And i'm getting fed up.

Everyone can go to hell."

I've grown as a person. I've become a better person. It's just surprising that there are so many people who don't want to see the good in you. People can change. It happens. 

I'm tired of the drama that people create and bring around. I want no part of it. You're childish, just grow up. It's long overdue.

I started writing down my ideas for my next story. I think that it's going to be really good. I was discussing it with Lee on Sunday. Throwing ideas back and forth from each other. I started a little bit of it. Shouldn't take too long.

Went to my eye doctor's appointment. I'm near-sighted. I have a stigmastim. Apparently, my left eyes is worse than my right one. But I got sexy glasses which i'll get in like a week or two. They're black on the outside and yellow on the inside. ;)

"event","I'm having a fantastic conversation with Lee. I think it's much needed and it's making us come to terms with some things in our relationship. We're beginning to understand each other a bit more. And I think that's fantastic. We need to be on the page to make this work. And I really hope that it does. We've been discussing things that have been bothering us, things that we need to work on as a couple and as individuals. Together we can make this work. As long as we keep being honest and open with ourselves and each other. And as long as we continue to try and understand where each of us is coming from and continuing to make compromises. I've never been good with compromises. As i've been looking back on my past serious relationships, I know that I have always been selfish. I always wanted things to go my way. And things didn't always have to be fair as long as I was getting my way. That's where i've made my mistakes. I can't expect someone to change what I don't like if I don't do the same for them. So in a way I have doomed my past relationships because of the way I acted. And in doing so I have hurt some amazing people. For that I am sorry. But with each decision that you make, you will learn about the error of your ways. And so there I have learned."

I got some new pictures which I will put up on myspace tomorrow, so don't worry. I must say though that I look pretty hot as a pirate. 

I got an email from Tom on friday. He asked if I was still available because he was looking for an assistant. So when I emailed him back I said that I was concentrating on my school work, but I would be available to fill in the position in two weeks. So he responded back to me telling him to call him on 10/16. It's been awhile and he's still interested in me so that's a good sign. Hopefully, i'll start working soon. I need more money.

I need to find a place where my creative juices will flow. I need to start writing again. Like real soon. I have three stories to write. Then I want to send some of my other stories out. Hopefully, editors will like them as much as the ones close to me has. That would be fantastic! I want to be a great writer. I want to fulfill my dreams of writing. And i'm going to try my best to make it happen. 

I'd also love to follow my dream as a model, but I don't see that happening in the near future. I don't have the self confidence in myself to follow through it plus i'm mad short. But I would love to find a photographer and get photo shoots done. That would be fun!"

I am currently unemployed. Which has actually worked out for the best. It's been giving me time to do my school work and write my stories. I never realized how hard writing is until now. It was always so easy for me. I wish I could go back to those times. I'm currently working one three stories. I hope to get some of my work out there really soon. Although, I have been on a few job interviews. I also have another one on Tuesday.

I have some pretty great friends, though we don't see each other much. We all lead busy lives I suppose. I'd love to see them more but I guess after high school it's perfectly normal for friends to grow apart. 

There is one friendship that is on my mind the most. I've been trying my hardest to make things better between us. But no matter how hard I truly try it gets me nowhere. Trust was broken. And it's hard to gain that back. I do miss the friendship though.

I'm in a relationship. We're having our ups and downs. It's only been four months and I never thought it would be this difficult. The fighting has gotten out of hand. But we're trying really hard to make this work. So we'll see what happens.

I am craving a change. Again. I already cut all my hair off. I'm thinking of dying it. But what I crave most is a change of scenery. I want to make the move. I think it's time for me to do so. Really soon. I need to be on my own. 

I am who I am today, where I am today, because this was my choice and it has served me well. However, it no longer serves me, my choices have changed, and I give thanks for the amazing changes that now sweep through my amazing life."

"event","i'm entirely too moody. it might have to do with the fact that i've been living on four hours of sleep a night. things are bothering me that shouldn't. but they do. and i can't control that. but i feel like i should be able to. i just don't know how. i love my boyfriend. i do. but he frustrates me. and he makes me so angry. but he makes me so happy too. it's hard to explain i guess. i miss him. i love spending time with him. and i know that him and i have two completely different lives. we're so different from each other. it's just that it bothers me when he talks to me in certain ways, in certain tones, when he yells at me. it bothers me when he drinks and parties. it bothers me that he parties with sorority girls and his fraternity boys. it bothers me that he trusts jeannine with certain aspects of his life and not me. i don't know why. and i can't help it. i wish i could. i'm tired of siting here and tears randomly start running down my face. or crying before i go to bed. because it's not his fault. he hasn't done anything wrong. i'm just touchy. and again i don't know why. meh."

"event","meh. it's hot. i'm tired. and people are stupid. plus they piss me off. what makes someone think that after a couple of months you can come back into my life and everything will be ok? like everything you did to me has vanished? and yesterday my mom told me that this guy i hooked up with is now engaged. the funny thing is is that he didn't want a girlfriend. another funny thing is that it's been what five months since we stopped hooking up? what guy who doesn't want a relationship suddenly gets engaged in five months? none. which means he was with her the entire time. and my so called ""friend"" who is best friends with this guy new the whole time. i totally never would have hooked up with him if i knew he had a girlfriend. boys are stupid. it's a good thing i found the last good one. and the boy unknowingly stole my heart. he's the best boyfriend in the world. and i love him to death."

"event","visiting lee was nice. i felt uncomfortable driving there. the turnpike scared me. but i lived. friday we went out to eat at wendy's. then to the exon mall. lee bought me two shirts. then to a party. but we left early. ordered a bunch of food when we got back to the dorm. saturday was our lazy day. we pretty much stayed in the dorm. except for our wawa run. i love wawa french vanilla cappuccinos. yummy!!!!! sunday we went to king prussia mall. god it's huge. i bought bra and panties from hot topic. then monday we went to the cafe for breakfast. afterwards we layed around til it was time for me to leave. stupid construction on the turnpike messed me all up. but i did good. i felt comfortable. and i made it home. all in all i had a good time. and if he's lucky i'll visit again. but one thing is for sure, it makes me glad that i never went to college myself. hahaha."

"event","i hate the way that we get annoyed with each other
i hate how our moods clash
i hate the way you talk to me when you don't get your way
i hate how you raise your voice and yell when you're upset or annoyed
i hate that out of the four days we've been together we'll fight for three
i hate that when we're upset with each other we don't feel connected
i hate the fact that there are times when i feel that i'm not good enough
i hate the way that we are
but what i hate most is how i hate the way i feel when i'm not with you"

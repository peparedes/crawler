"event","last night i went to youth group with jessica and sean. it was really fun. yesterday sean's mom took us there and we went home around like 9:30 at night. oh yeah i had therapy yesterday, too!!!! that was a joy, not!!!!! but it is actually helping me out. well today is thursday and i got to school late, (by the way not my fault for being late) and the bell rang and i kept going to my class and then right by my class like ten feet away from there, the proctor calls me and says do you have a pass and then i said no,so he was like give me your id you have a detention. what sucks though is that my cousin who made us late has her class right around the corner and she did not have to pass the gate,so she did not get a detention. by two feet she did not geta detention. that so sucks!!! well when my mom hears that she is going to flip because i got a detention that was not even intended for me because it was not my idea that we were late."

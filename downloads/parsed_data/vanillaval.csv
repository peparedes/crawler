This journal wasn't meant for everyone to read, and I don't even know how you people who have been reading it found out about it. I'm tired of being questioned about what I write in here. It's personal stuff and I feel that only a few certain people have the right to be reading them. If you can read my entries, then you're one of those people. If you get this message instead, you're not one of those people.. so sorry."

-The Dashboard concert was awesome. I got to talk to Michael. Best night of my life.
-Freshman year has come to an end. It was mediocre, more or less.
-Went camping up north with jordan. That was cool.
-Dad cancelled Cedar Point on me. Sadly enough, I'm not surprised.
-Louise and I talked some things over about the Brightoners and shizz and it seemed to clear some things up. Louise is my most understanding friend. I don't know where I would be without her.
-Went to Brighton with Louise today. I was rather disappointed, for various reasons. Mostly because I felt left out most of the time. But I'm happy for Louise, 'cause I know she had a good time with Derek.
-Lately I'm feeling like I don't belong anywhere. It's hard to explain. I thought that I fit in well with the Brighton people, but after today, I'm not so sure. I met like, two of Jordan's friends recently but didn't feel a conncection there. I'm thinking I'm going to want to meet more of her friends and hang out with Jordan more. Since Jordan rocks. At home I feel out of place. In my group of friends, I'm rarely invited anywhere. At the Dashboard concert, I was basically the last resort. Blah, I'm starting to realize it's been like this a long time and I don't know how I can get out of this..hole. Or whatever horrible trap this is."

"event","So I had my audition for the news team today and...I didn't make it. I was trying not to get my hopes up, but I was pretty confident since only three freshmen were trying out (and that's how many future-sophomores they wanted), and everyone's always told me I'm a good public speaker. I know it's dorky, but I really wanted it, I think it would be a lot of fun. I wanted to walk down the hall and people would be like ""hey, there goes that girl on the announcements."" It was a chance to get noticed by, er, ""certain people"", if you get my meaning. Anyway, here's how it went:

Mrs. Pump's teacher assistant, who's a senior, gave me and Kim some tips a few days ago and said to try and put the announcements they give you in your own words without missing the important stuff. I also talked to Sarah, who tried out last year. She didn't make it, so she's on expert on what not to do, haha. I was advised by her to not swivel in my chair, don't ask to start over, know what the date is, and know what I'm going to say before I go in there. I went second, after Kim. Swiveling in the chair is inevitable. I sat down and I was swiveling away, without even realizing it, until it suddenly dawned on me like half-way through the audition and I stopped. I think I did fairly well on it, for the most part. I didn't stumble over my words and I had a lot of eye contact. When I had read all of the announcements I forgot about my conclusion and I sort of just stared at them until Mrs. Zaar, one of the media center ladies who judged me, reminded me to wrap it up. My introduction was sort of close to the tradition: ""Good morning Walled Lake Central, today is Thursday, May 15th, and we have some exciting announcements for you today, listen up."" And then for my conclusion: ""That's it for your announcements today, Central."" I was lame like Mr. Hess and added a ""Happy Thursday."" That's probably why they didn't take me, lol. Anyway, I dragged Sarah back to the media center a little bit later so we could find out if we made it. Mrs. Zaar came up to us and said to Sarah, ""We put you on."" And then she turned to me and said, ""YOU were GREAT!..but we didn't put you on the list. We want you to try out again, though."" *I stare blankly at her in disbelief* ""You read very well and had great eye contact. But I think there were some comments about your hair and how it might get in your face"" - I didn't exactly have my hair behind my ears but it wasn't like it was covering my face either - ""and how you were kind of making nervous movements in your chair."" Damn swiveling! If they don't want people to swivel, then they shouldn't have the stupid swivel chairs in there in the first place. So that was basically all she told me that was wrong, and then she said that if anyone drops it she'll probably come looking for me. That's reassuring...*sarcastic voice* Next year when I try out I'll wear my hair up. Jeez. I had no idea they'd be so picky. Oh well, it's their loss! Kim made it, and I'm happy for her. She's good with this kinda stuff, plus her hair is short, so it doesn't get in the way.

I'm pretty proud of myself for not getting too bummed out. ""Hope to win, expect to lose."" I <i>am</i> disappointed in myself, since I couldn't control my swiveling desires and all. I'm angry at the media center ladies who are too critical. And like I said, I did really want this. But I'll get over it.

Well I have wanted to meet Chelsea, along with the other Brighton people, for awhile now, especially since we have become (well, at least I think we did) better friends through talking online a bit. Chelsea has told me she wants to get together, but now I'm not so sure. I might just be being paranoid, but she never seems to IM me, and the last time I IMed her, she signed off suddenly without saying anything. Well, when we suggested to Louise that we all have a get-together at the mall awhile back, Louise weirded out and said that it bothered her for me to meet Chelsea and them...so we just never planned anything. I'm still not sure why Louise doesn't want me to meet the Brighton people, Louise never talked to me about it, and I'm too scared to bring it up. Well, I was reading Chelsea's DJ, and she mentioned that Louise and Derek are going to the mall this weekend, and that she, Stacy, and Matt would probably go as well. I *sigh* am probably being selfish and inconsiderate, yet again, but I just don't understand why Louise doesn't invite me too, seeing how she knows how much I want to meet everyone. Plus there's the fact that Louise told me she would go to Paint-the-Town with me on Saturday, and then ""protect"" me when I go to the movies with this Jeremy guy on Sunday, so it'll be hard for her to go to the mall this weekend without breaking her word to me. I understand that she'd like to spend some time with Derek - those two are an item now ;) - but I <i>did</i> offer for her to bring Derek along as a sort of ""double date"" (eek) when we go to the movies on Sunday. So not seeing Derek wouldn't be a problem. I just think she's trying to avoid me meeting them, and it hurts my feelings. Most likely I'm making a big deal out of nothing,  and I misread the situation and I want to meet Chelsea more than she wants to meet me, or maybe she just doesn't want to meet me at all. I think I'm just desperate and obsessive to make friends and get people to like me. I dunno how often you guys read my LJ, but whenever you do read this, if you could please talk to me and tell me what's going on I would really appreciate it and feel a lot better. And I'm sorry if this upsets you and I'm sorry if I'm just being a loser. :("

"event","TGIF sooo much, man. Ever since I went back to school after break, I've been HATING it with a PASSION. I dread waking up on days I have school, I hate being at school, and I hate going home from school and doing more work. Actually, I don't mind being at school all that much, as long as I'm with my friends and not in a boring class or anything, but it's the homework I hate. I just haven't been doing it lately, or I'll do like half of one assignment and then give up. And then at the end of the night, I feel crappy and unproductive and irresponsible, but by that time it's too late to do it. I really, really need a lot of time off from all this work and I just can't wait for summer..I need it now. I have a lot of things to look forward to: camp!, drivers ed., camping up north with friends, Cedar Point, and just being FREE.

I kinda feel like everyone's been weirding out on me lately. Melissa lied to me and Michelle about us not having to turn in any homework on the quiz day, so I didn't have any of the three assignments we had to turn in. I can thank Melissa for all the points I WON'T be getting. And then Lauren made up some bull shit story about how she was going to Cedar Point on June 10th (the day of the Dashboard concert) and wanted to know if I could come. I explained to her about the concert, which she didn't sound too happy about, and then I asked her why she was going to Cedar Point on a day we had finals. When I said that, she was like, ""Well, I'm actually going on July 10th, I accidentally said June."" So I said, ""Oh, well I can go then."" And then she all of sudden changed her mind about going because she hates roller coasters. Does she seriously think I'm that stupid? If she had a date set, it would have obviously been all planned out, and I seriously doubt that she would just throw it all away like that. And why would she plan a trip to Cedar Point in the first place if she hates roller coasters. AND I find it hard to believe that the date she ""accidentally"" said to me just happened to be the same day of the concert. So I asked her for an explanation, and all she said was ""no"". Later she told me that at least I didn't lie about going to the concert, and she'd been having trouble with people telling the truth about doing things without her or something like that. Even still, it's other people that she's been having the problems with, and she's just assuming that I would do the same..she's done this before. She could have simply asked about the concert, but instead she had to lie to me and create false hopes about going to Cedar Point. It's good to know she trusts me. And Alecia seems to take everything I say or do seriously. Yesterday I didn't IM her or something, and she IMed me and asked why I never talk to her anymore, when in truth I had IMed her just last night. I mentioned that to her and she was like, ""Yeah, to ask me about rides!"" I asked her if she liked roller coasters and invited her to go to Cedar Point. You'd think she'd be a bit more appreciative.

Today I had an appointment to go to the Orthopedics Man. I got X-Rayed and the guy like moved my hands around for less than a minute, and he told me that my elbow's back to normal. I was hoping that maybe it hadn't healed and I would need a cast after all, but no such luck. Well, I did get out of school till like 5th hour. This morning while I was lying in bed, my dad was over for who-knows-what reason, and after my sister left for school my mom and him go into another one of their arguments. I swear, they argue more now than they did when they were married. It's becoming a weekly ritual. I heard the whole thing...I don't really mind, I guess I've become sort of numb to it, and most of the stuff my mom yells at my dad for is basically true. He doesn't pay the child support he needs to because he has a crappy job, so my mom has to work all the time to make up for it. So my mom screams at him to get his act together, he says he will (but not before they scream at each other some more), but he never does. Nothing new. It just gets annowying.

On a lighter note, it looks as though Louise and I will be going to Cedar Point!! :-D Next weekend, May 17th, on my mom's birthday. My sister is going for this band festival thing, and since my mom is chaperoning, I thought, hey, maybe I could come along then, too. But then I found out that the chaperones have to ride on the bus, and seeing how I'm not in middle school band or orchestra, I won't be able to join them. But then it occurred to me that my dad can take us, and what's more, he can get us there at opening time, we can stay till closing time if we want to, he's got a van that can transport more people and watch movies on the way there and back, and best of all, he sprained his ankle badly so he'll be needing a wheelchair. And you know what that means. Front of the lines, baby! WHOOP WHOOP. Here's the exciting part...last night, Louise was invited into a chat that had Alexa and Monica in it. They, er, haven't been getting along lately - I'll leave it at that. Well, all the Brighton people were discussing their trip to Cedar Point, so Louise mentioned that she was going to Cedar Point with me on the 17th. Well it just so happens! that they're all going on the same day. hehehe I found that quite humorous. Those two freaked out about the prospect of being within the same 25 acres as Louise and wanted to change the date and everything. Psh, forget them. You'd think they'd be mature enough to handle it. It's a big park. It's hard to find people, even when you're trying to. But whatever. If they're gonna let the fact that they're going to be in the same amusement park with Louise ruin their day, then it's their loss. On the bright side of things, I may be able to meet Chelsea and them after all, if Louise decides to meet them somewhere or something like that. Either way, I'm excited to be going with Louie!!

"event","My LiveJournal has a new look. It's hott.

The other day Michelle told me she read that last entry of my LiveJournal. That was a bit embarrassing. Sorry, Michelle. I feel really bad about what I said, especially since she invited me to spend the night the very next day. Just to let anyone know, I probably don't mean anything mean or bitchy or whiny I write in here. Most likely I'm just in a really bad mood and I'm getting things out, and most of the time they're things that aren't really true. So don't be offended if it's about you or anything. 

So I went to visit Erica and Asia. It was fun, but I didn't have as much fun as I thought I might have. I hadn't seen them since camp, which was last summer, so it took awhile for us to warm up to each other, and when we finally did, I had to go home. There was a lot of awkward silences, lol. I think I've had better conversations with Asia online than I did when I was actually in her presence. It's probably because we both have more time to think of things to say, I guess. Plus there's the factor that I'm really shy until I get to know people. Their friends were around a lot of the time, too, and I didn't feel all that comfortable around them. They kinda came off as a bit mean and irresponsible, and sometimes I felt that I was just a little sister or something, following them around, since they were all older and I didn't know what to say most of the time. Haha, Asia once said something like, ""There's something I figured out about Valerie. She's really quiet and shy, but when she does talk, it's like a burn or something. Valerie is secretly evil inside."" Heck, that's probably true, lol. Nonetheless, I still had a good time. It was really fun to talk about our camp/backpacking memories. Like David, the really short 15-year-old that had facial hair, thick glasses, and wore his socks up to his knees, and made us all listen to the songs he made up while we roasted smores. Or when we found that huge boat. There was just a random boat sitting there on the beach of Lake Michigan. It was kinda scary. It was a really nice, boat, too, and someone had just left it there. They keys were still in the ignition and everything...and there was like half-full juice boxes sitting on it. We were almost expecting to find dead bodies on it or something, haha. That would be pretty awesome. Anyway...

The day after I came home from Rochester, my mom and I met Louise and her mom at Galyan's and me and Louie went rock-climbing. Fun stuff. Louise gave up on me halfway, but I kept going until I almost reached the top, and then it got pretty difficult. I've climbed all the way to the top like twice before, but I just couldn't get there this time. My arms started to get really tired, so I came down. Well, it's a good thing I went rock-climbing then, 'cause I won't be able to for awhile...my mom bought me new rollerblades, a helmet, and all the guard and everything while we were at Galyan's as a late Eater present. When I got home, I was all excited to try out my brand-new rollerblades, right? So I put them on, then my mom tells me that we have to leave to go to my aunt's and celebrate my Grandpa's birthday. Well, it's a short ride, so I figured I'd just wear them over and then I could do some rollerblading. We get to her house, and I jump out of the car and exclaim, ""Cool! Smooth roads!"" Before U even know it, I'm flyin' down the driveway, out of control. (I haven't been rollerblading in, like, three years. Pity, I used to be so good at it.) My mom screams, ""Val, you need to get your guards on!"" CLUNK. I go crashing into a ditch. I got up right away and said ""Mom, I'm fine!!"" so she wiuldn't be alarmed. But the arm I landed felt really..strange. It didn't hurt all that much, but it had a tingling sensation and was making strange movements. It wasn't long before it was swelling up and I found I couldn't move it anymore. So my mom and I hop in the car to go to the ER. They're not supposed to X-Ray elbows without a doctor's permission first, but since my mom used to work there, she had her connections ;) and got me in. The lady was like, ""It doesn't look like anything's broken, so you'll be able to go on home soon enough!"" But then she came back up to us and told us that the radioligist looked at it and it came back positive, meaning I broke something, and she showed us the X-Ray and there was this tiny hairline fracture on my elbow. My mom asked her if I would need a cast and she said ""probably"" so I was really happy. I'd never had a cast before!! Haha, my mom said it was kinda sick that I was all ecstatic that I fractured my arm, and that's kinda true, but casts rock man. So the next day I had to go see an orthopedics doctor (Michael once said he wanted to go into orthopedics...) and we had trouble finding one for me since they were all booked up. My mom was like, ""Gee, they must make a lot of money."" And I thought, well that'll be good for when I marry Michael, hehehe. And get this...the orthopedic doctor I went to's name was Dr. Michaelson. As Louise said, it's a siiign. He had very soft hands. ;) Whoo. Okay I'm babbling here... Well, I didn't need a stupid cast, and I was thoroughly disappointed. I did get to wear a sling for about a week though, which was awesome, but got annoying after awhile.

To update quickly on some things... Lauren invited me to go to Gameworks with her and Michelle for her birthday on Sunday, which I thought was really nice of her. I've only been friends with her for like a few months and she picked me instead of people she's known for a long time. Not to gloat or anything, I just felt special. So that was fun. Alexa and sorta Derek I guess haven't been giving Louise too much respect (so what else is new?). OH! And I'm going to a Dashboard Confessionl concert on June 10th, Alecia's birthday!! WHOO!

I think that's it. This is kinda long but I'm trying to write in here more and keep up on things."

"event","Well, my break is not off to a very good start. I'm probably just being pessimistic and selfish. Actually, I am being pessimistic and selfish, but don't I have a right to be?! I'm sick of sitting home on Friday nights (or Thursday nights, in this case) and watching everyone getting along and having fun without me. It's just...grr. I don't know how to word it. I can recall various times when I'll be online and I'll ask nonchalantly, ""so what did you do today?"", already knowing that it'll be something fun they did with someone else, but pretending I'm fine with it. And the answer will be something like ""i went to the mall with blah and now blah is spending the night,"" or ""umm im going to the movies with blah and blah blah."" Just last night Michelle was telling me Stephanie was spending the night, and for some reason that really pissed me off. It just wiped the smile off my face. I'm fully aware that this makes me a jealous bitch, and I'm sorry, but really, isn't everyone a jealous bitch when they don't get invited to do things? Even when I do my part and I invite people to do stuff with me, it seems they always already have plans, or they're busy, etc. All week I've been inviting everyone to go see the movie Holes today but no one really seemed to want to go, and now I see that everyone already made plans to do otherwise. Alex is busy redecorating her room, and Michelle has plans with her brother, but that's understandable. Lauren is leaving for Vegas tomorrow, so she won't be able to go. And then when I called the twins just a little bit ago to see if they still wanted to go and maybe go the mall too, Melissa was like ""Oh, well, we made plans to spend the night at our friend from Northern's, and we're going to the movies with her, too...but you can come along if you want."" I'm not too keen on going, knowing that I'll probably be the odd one out since I don't know their friend, plus, it being Mel and Liss, they're gonna wanna see <i>What A Girl Wants</i> and I have no desire to see that movie whatsoever. And then there's the aftermath of the movie, where all three of them go off together happily, and I go home, alone, knowing that they're gonna have a great time at their friend's. Kara's going, but she's friends with the Northern girl, too, and I asked Alecia to go, but apparently she doesn't get along with this girl, says she is ""loud"" and ""annoying"". So she kind of blew me off so she wouldn't have to spend time with her. But, ugh, because I am so bored and so desperate for company, I'm going to go anyway.

I just can't wait 'til Monday. I'm going to Rochester to visit Erica and Asia, my dear friends from camp. AAAH I really wanna see them. My camp friends are the only people who TRULY understand me. Yeah, that's sappy, I know, but I love camp and my camp friends more than anything. I called Asia the other day to make plans and it was so great just to hear her voice. Erica, too. I'm spending one night at Erica's and another at Asia's, and maybe I'll stay for another day, depending on how it goes. Asia got her license today, and she has her own car, too (""Lola the Teal Car""), so she can DRIVE us places! Whoo hoo hoo. I can't wait to see them and I can't wait to get out of here and I can't wait to see people that will include me."

<b>How do you feel about yourself</b>: A walking open wound, a trophy display of bruises, and I don't believe that I'm getting any better.
<b>Describe where you live</b>: And this apartment is starving for an argument, anything at all to break the silence.
<b>Describe how you live</b>: Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes, perfect make-up but you're barely scraping by. You can't fake it hard enough to please everyone, or anyone at all. The grave that you refuse to leave, the refuge that you've built to flee, the places you have come to fear the most.
<b>Describe how you love</b>: I'll be true, I'll be useful, I'll be cavalier, I'll be yours, my dear, and I'll belong to you, if you'll just let me through. 
This is easy as lovers go, so don't complicate it by hesitating, and this is wonderful as loving goes, this is telling me what's the sense in waiting. And I said, ""I've gotta be honest...I've been waiting for you all of my life.""
<b>Share a few words of wisdom</b>: Color the coast with your smile, it's the most genuine thing I've ever seen. 
Truth is in a tall beer... just kidding...
<b>Describe your best friend(s)</b>: You are the most, you're so rad, you're so fresh, and I'm so glad I am yours, you are mine. When I was down, came to me, and promised to always be by my side. 
Sometimes it seems you're not with me, it hurts me so much, it hurts me so much.
They are my life, my world. They make everyday of mine a wonderful one. When we are going through troubles, we come out on top, together. I love you guys, my friends, my world. The gifts you bring me, will never be returned. Truly incredible, never fake, my entirety within you. Your smiles, never forgotten. You saved me, you saved me. I can't thank you enough for everything you have done. I was on my last string, about to fall hard. You came in and lifted me up. Made me feel wanted, needed. This bond you have made with me is too strong to be broken now. We can make it through anything. I'm always here for you guys, like you are for me. Always, always. You saved my life. And you will always be loved by me, and never forgotten.
<b>How do they feel about you?</b>: You are the best lawyer in town!

I'm supposed to be cleaning my room, but I'm not. So what else is new."

"event","Yesterday was a half day. Half days are always pointless since the classes are only about 25 minutes long and we never get anything done, and then when you get home, you sadly realize that you would've still been sleeping if you hadn't bothered to go to school. Yesterday was such a day, but everyone believed it to be even more lacking of a purpose than usual since we only had first and second hour for 25 minutes and then an assembly the rest of the day. I told my mom this and she said that I had a choice whether or not I wanted to stay home, but she would prefer if I went. So I dragged myself out of bed, thinking that the assembly may be interesting. I really wish I would've stayed home.

Turns out the assembly was organized by SADD (Students Against Destructive Decisions). They sure know how to ruin a half day. The assembly was a mock car crash caused by drunk driving. It was soo realistic, they had ambulances, fire trucks, and everything...even a helicopter was supposed to show up and take one of the ""victims"" away, but it couldn't make it because it had to attend to an actual medical emergency. Near the end, one of the girls in the crash died, and then they started playing the song ""I Will Remember You"" bt Sarah McLachlan over and over. I was really touched and a lot of people got pretty emotional. I was about to cry, and I don't even have anyone to cry for, so I can't imagine what it would be like for someone who had a relative or close friend actually have something like that happen to them. For most of the rest of the day I was in a depressed mood; I think pretty much everyone was. This is corny, but I went home and listened to ""I Will Remember You"" some more, just to reflect on it, and as I was listening, I felt really empty inside. The real meaning of the song never occurred to me until I saw that assembly. It really saddens me to think that even though it was only pretend, things like that actually do happen, everday, and only because of stupidity. I already knew that drinking and driving is a bad idea, but the assembly had a big impact on me and now I know for sure that I will do everything in my ability to prevent that from happening to myself and others. You think that something like that will never happen to you, but it can, and if you're not careful, it will. If you're reading this, don't drink and drive. It's not worth it. 

On a lighter note, I went to the senior auction last night with Louise, Stephanie, and Alecia, which was a lot fun. Lots of hott seniors guys, and there were a few Michaels there. That really made my night, you'll know why if you know what kind of Mikes I am talking about. Louise made a bid on Mike Sachs, lol, I'm proud of her, that really took some courage. Unfortunately, some lucky foo, as Louise would say, got him for 23 bucks. If my mom would've given me a 20, and she almost did, we would've had him. Oh well, we got to see him unbotton his shirt, and just that was enough. And then Alecia didn't bid on Pat and Bill, the crazy girl. The whole purpose of going was so she could buy Pat!! haha Pat was all like, ""Why didn't you buy me??""

More of my friends decided to go to morp, so I'm pretty happy. Louise always sticks by my side so she was already going, I'm pretty sure Alecia is going if Stephanie gets out of babysitting and she can go too, Kara's going now that more people are coming, and so is Lauren, which is a surprise, but once she heard that they were going to Burger King for dinner she couldn't pass up the chance. Michelle can't go, and neither can Alex, but she seems to enjoy rubbing it in that she wouldn't go even if she could, and the twins seem to just agree with whatever she says. I mean, I don't think I'm asking all that much by wanting them to go to the stupid dance. This is basically all for their senior prom, and if they don't go to things like this, then they can't expect to have a very good prom. Plus I feel that if they were really my friends and if they really cared they would sacrifice some of their precious time out of their busy schedules to go to morp for me. There's not even much to sacrifice! It's a frickin DANCE, it should be fun!! Why does it matter what you wear, what the name of the dance is, or what kind of music they're gonna play, as long as you're with your friends.. you just have to let yourself have fun, jeez. But no, Alex and the twins ""don't feel like it"" and they have ""better things to do"". That really makes me feel better, guys.. you have better things to do or you don't feel like doing me a favor and hanging out. Whatever, I've gotten over it, and I really don't care anymore, anyway.

I think that's everything..."

"event","Ugh. That's pretty much the only word that can desribe the way I feel right now. I'm sooo.. BLAHish that you can't even come close to conceiving it. Personally, I'm against people complaining in their LJs and DJs for everyone to see, because I think life is s a blessing, and you shouldn't go and point out all the things that suck. I love my life, but I'm gonna bitch about it anyway because I fucking feel like it.

I don't know.. it seems like just when I start to feel accepted, I go and get left out again. Everyone is doing something and going somewhere with someone, but of course, no one thinks to invite Val! Is there something WRONG with me?? There must be! I'm sitting at home thinking, ""Well no one must be doing anything special, since no one mentioned it..."" And then I find out that that isn't the case at all, they just don't want me around. Alecia and Stephanie are together, Lauren and Michelle are together, the twins and Alex are together... I know they don't realize it, but it really stabs me in the back when I figure out that they're doing stuff without me and they don't give a damn. Am I being selfish? I probably am, but right now I can't help but to be selfish about this. Does it even occur to them that maybe I would like to be included? 

And then there was another Jordan-riot. Jordan hates everyone, everyone hates Jordan, and they all hate ME for it. What bothers me so much is that it's all so..STUPID. I know that they are all more mature than this, but they don't seem to want to act like it. I honestly don't know why Jordan is doing this. Maybe she just doesn't realize that when she torments them, she's tormenting me, too. It's not easy to see your best friend mouth off all of your other, new friends and you can't do anything about it. If I stand by and watch, everyone yells at me for not doing anything about it, but if I do speak against Jordan, I feel like I'm betraying her. But really.. what CAN I do about it?? What do they expect me to do? I can't control what she says, it's not my fault, but they fucking get mad at me anyway because I happen to be associated with her.

Plus, Louise is angry because Chelsea and I are becoming better friends. Louise says that it bothers her that Chelsea and I are making plans, but it wouldn't bother her if it was anyone else but me... neither she or I know why that is, but Louise doesn't seem to want to talk about it and figure out why because whenever I ask she'll just be like ""I don't wanna talk about it."" I don't know what to do, I don't know what I could possibly do to fix this. And the way Louise says that ""if it was anyone but Val"" it wouldn't bother her, it makes it sound like <b>I'm</b> the problem. I honestly didn't think it would be all that big of a deal if I wanted to meet Chelsea and everyone else in person. Louise, I'm not angry with you, and I hope you're not mad at me, and I really want to work this out. Please talk to me about it!

On top of all that, our country is at war. This is just what I need. I hate war. I hate the idea of people going out to bomb another country, to kill other people, and then they have the nerve to tell us that it's a ""just cause"". How can that be?! I am SO sick of all this... of my alarm going off in the morning, and the first thing I hear is people talking about what's going on in Iraq, of turning on the TV and all I see is coverage on the war, of going to school and hearing people talking about it, seeing it on the TVs during lunch, and then going home again and hearing my parents talk about how much this war is a problem, and seeing President Bush be stupid and continue to do this.

My thoughts and prayers are with the soldiers in Iraq and the Iraqi people. <b>God Bless America.</b>

I think it's because when I go to update it, I look at all the stupid and boring things I've written in the past, and then I get discouraged. So most of the time I end up not updating at all to prevent myself from writing even more stupid and boring things. But when I do update, forgive me for the things I say. They seemed to be just right at the time.

Yesterday night everyone went to Leo's Coney Island for dinner. When I say ""everyone"" I mean the twins, Michelle, Lauren, Alecia, Stephanie, Kara, and Louise. Alex couldn't go 'cause she's off somewhere on a cruise for break (and we almost had it!). Surprisingly, it went really smoothly. That was actually the first time they've done something all together. I thought that was kinda sad...it seems like most of the time they can't all be friends without something going wrong, or someone not inviting someone. So with all of them together, anything could happen... I was almost afraid that all hell would break loose. And with that group.. it could happen!! We all had a really great time, though, and I hope we can do it again. We went to the dollar store afterwards and ran around rather obnoxiously. Alecia threatened me with a whisk, I think it was, so I whacked her with a measuring cup and I sort of drew blood, but it's all good! And then Stephanie tried to brush my hair with a scrubbing brush, which was just plain wrong. Louise, Alecia and I rode around on brooms in the cleaning section... then we all bought cheap candy that tasted like crap, but that's all right! After that we stopped by Hollywood Video and commented loudly at every other movie.

Sammi has been treating Louise like shit, so I'm really glad she came with us last night, and so was everyone else. I know that Louise doesn't always feel comfortable around my friends but I think with time she'll fit right in. I know that Melonie and Melissa really like Louise, and she wants her to hang out with us more. They said that themselves, and not just because they feel sorry for her because of the whole Sammi thing... they think Louise is cool, lol.

So yeah, Mel and Liss came home with me and spent the night afterwards. We watched some movies (including Moulin Rouge!!...they loved it!) and then at like one in the morning we started baking cookies, lol. I think I ate more dough than I did cookies. Ugh. That's not something I want to repeat. We stayed up till like four... or rather, they tried to go to sleep, but I kept them awake until four when we all finally gave in. We talked up quite a storm about Alecia's brother. Surprise, surprise. Then we watched Moulin Rouge some more, and then we watched it again the morning. I've got some Moulin Rouge-lovers in the making up in hurr, haha.

Break's almost over. The fact that I've got only like a day and a half left of break is ruining my day and a half left of break. Depressing, I know. I'm out..."

So skiing is over! No more practice, no more races! I feel so FREE!! It was a lot of fun but I'm definitely ready for a break. I feel like I'm not doing too well in school and I want to spend more time on my homework and stuff.

Saturday night I had Winterfest. I've been looking forward to another dance since homecoming, though everyone says that Winterfest is always lame and hardly anyone goes every year. But since I'm a loser and on student council they made me go, and I made everyone else go with me, though I couldn't convince Lauren and Michelle. Beforehand I went to dinner with Louise, M Squared, Kara, Alecia, and Stephanie. I felt really bad.. Louise asked to go to dinner with Sammi and she said no, that bitch. Haha, screw her Louie!! You don't need her or a date to have a good time!

Anyway, I had a really great time! It was more fun than homecoming, and that's pretty hard to beat. There was a lot more people there than I expected. I danced a lot, a lot, so much that my legs are sore two days later and i can't even walk down the freaking stairs. I had a hell of a lot of fun.. it's like it put me in this happy sort of mood that I still haven't gotten out of, and I wish they would have more dances or that I could have that sort of fun more often. It kinda makes me feel high (on life, that is)... dancing away, not caring about what anyone thinks or about anything at all. 

I can't wait for the next dance... April 5th is Morp! But I hope a lot of people come 'cause I heard that upperclassmen think that a dance organized by freshmen would be gay... but I mean, a dance is a dance... and Louise wants to invite Chelsea and Derek and Stacy and Matt to come. It'll be cool to see Chelsea again and meet them all! 
*Whispers* Matt's hair makes me giggly..

AleciaM5: i'm scared of my brother

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow 
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

You're gonna be the one that saves me

"event","It was a mess at skiing yesterday. Originally, we were supposed to have a meet, but that had to be rescheduled because we still needed to do time trials, but when we got there (which was at 3:30, we needed to be there early to set up the courses on the race hill and stuff like that) they were like ""Yeah, you guys are racing against Western."" This, obviously, was not cool because we didn't know who was on varsity yet, and a lot of us had never raced before, and we just weren't ready. So when Adam finally got there he picked the four girls and guys that he already knew were the best and then randomly picked two other girls and guys. At first, he picked me and Alecia, but then I protested and he put Alex in my place. Alecia started freaking out, like, really badly. She was sitting there shaking, about to cry, and she said she felt like throwing up. Meanwhile, the timers weren't working or something like that, and the race was delayed, like, two hours. Adam told us that the people who weren't racing could go to the lodge and get warm. I stayed to comfort Toast, but Stephanie, who is supposedly her best friend, sat there whining about how cold she was and how I wouldn't go with her to get hot chocolate. I told her that I didn't want to leave Alecia, but she went on to complain how Alecia wasn't racing for another twenty minutes, yadda yadda. Some best friend. Sheesh. Some people bother me...

Anyway, when the race finally started, and they got through the slalom course, the timers stopped working again, so we sat around for another forty-five minutes or so. By the time they finished the race, and we could do time trials, it was already 7:30 and they had already pulled the slalom course so we could only do trials on GS. This was good, 'cause I'm better at GS, but before we could finish the trials, the lady who was running the timer had to leave because of ""family obligations"", so Adam told everyone to just go home. It was 8:30 by then, and I had been sitting at the top of a ski hill in the cold for five hours. I was starving and exhausted, there was no food at home, and I still had all this homework to do. I did about half of my homework and sat down on the couch to take a break. The next thing I knew, it was five in the morning. I was like, dead tired, I had to take a shower, and I still had that homework to finish. Thankfully, my mom said that I should probably stay home and rest since I haven't missed that much school. So yeah, that's why I'm home today. I have to go to ski practice again today and do the time trials all over again.. If I don't go then I'll be that one lone person who's on J.V.

So today I slept, ate things, finished up my homework, and talked to people at school while they were in web design, lol. Since I'm really bored, I'm going to steal Jordan's idea and list 50 things I hate and 50 things I love. Jordan, you steal my quizzes, so now we're even.

50 Things I Hate
1. Messy rooms
2. Being rejected
3. Not getting a 4.0
4. Snow blowers in my face, especially when I don't have goggles, and I have to shut my eyes, then I crash into trees, etc.
5. Find out the food you just ate had expired some time ago
6. When my cats scratch me
7. When my cats wake me up in the middle of the night because they want to be cuddled, or because they want to be let outside, or because they're trying to steal my pillow (Damn you, Oreo!)
8. Not being able to sleep when you know you need the sleep
9. When I lose my chapstick
10. When people try to tell me that there's no God
11. When Jordan does stupid and inconsiderate things, like hiding my shoes on bookshelves at Borders, though they may be funny at first, or even more funnier later on, haha
12. Being hungry and forgetting your lunch or your lunch money
13. Swimming in gym class. Ugh.
14. Menstrual cramps, haha
15. When chairlifts come up behind you when you're not ready, and that bar in the middle of the two-person chairlift that always manages to hit your butt, and falling off chairlifts, and dropping something when you're on a chairlift, and chairlifts that aren't properly cushioned, and the Alpine Valley chairlift people (the chairlift people up north are friendly and say things like ""There ya go"" and ""Have a nice ride"" or ask how you are, the people at Alpine just stand there, or they have headphones on, which makes me feel unsafe), and when people in chairlifts make comments on your skiing or yell ""Yard sale!"" when you wipe out and lose your poles and your skis, and just chairlifts in general
16. Not having air conditioning in the summer, it sucks, more than you'll ever know
17. Icy ski runs
18. When you have too much to do and not enough time to do it
19. Nights that last too long

"event","I guess I should write about my trip up north. That was pretty fun. Marina and I had some good times, haha. Lotsa pillow fights. And her mom kept on wanting to feed me, haha. Not that that's a bad thing. I was kinda disappointed in Caberfae Peaks, even though I wasn't expecting much, but as long as it's better than Alpine. Which it was, but not by much. The conditions weren't all that great, either. It was really icy, and Marina fell because of that, like, eight times. No offense, Marina! I love you! We started stalking this one guy, too. Once, we were on top of a hill, about to go down, and we were staring at him because he was like inching down the hill. We laughed at him, but then he waved at us, so he was cool. Later on we saw him again, but he didn't notice us. Then, when we came back to the same hill, he was there--AGAIN. This time we followed him, but he fell various times on the way down, and it was hard to keep behind him without being obvious. We were just plotting a way for him to get to notice us (somewhere along the lines of Marina crashing into him) when we lost sight of him and didn't see him again. *Sniffle* The stalking was fun while it lasted, though. And I think my skiing has improved somewhat. Skiing on steeper hills, I think, forced me to ski on my edges more. I might go skiing tomorrow with Stephanie and Alex and maybe Toast. Alex spent half of break at a racing camp.. 'nuff said. I'm scurred.

"event","Yay, I'm going skiing up north after all, thanks to Marina!! :-D As expected, no one bought the damn truck, so it's confirmed (as if it wasn't already) that I'm not going skiing at Boyne with Dad. But it's all good 'cause Marina invited me to go up north skiing at Crystal Mountain and this other place I can't spell. We're only going for one night but that's all I need. Yay for Marina!!!

So it's New Year's Eve and I'm sitting here. Alone. Everyone is at a party, but all I've done tonight is grocery shopping (but when you go grocery shopping at Whole Foods, it's always a fun experience!). Now that I say it, it's.. really sad. I did see Louise at Entertainment Tonight, but I was in the car. I screamed at her and banged on the window, but she didn't hear me. :( *grumble, grumble* Stupid Louie...

I can't believe the year's gone. It all went by too fast. School ended, I went to camp, then came home in what seemed like two days. High school started before I knew it, and then there was Christmas, which I'm finally starting to realize is gone, too. Now 2003 is two hours away. *Shivers* I'm really glad holiday break was extended, otherwise I would have been going back to school the day after tomorrow, and that would not have been cool.

My New Year's Resolutions:
-Work harder in school and start getting those freakin' 4.0s
I am working hard in school, but I don't think I'm giving my all, like when I did the second half of 8th grade. It's time for me to get back in gear!
-Practice my piano every day, when possible
My lesson yesterday was really bad. I feel like I'm letting Kathy down when I don't practice, and I think I really am. Usually she gives me all this praise and tells my mom ""She's going great!!"" after every lesson, even if I didn't do all that well, and then I feel so good about myself. But yesterday, as I was playing, she said, all grimly, ""I can tell you haven't looked at this."" Yeah, so if or when I have time, I'm going to be practicing!!
-Clean my room
It's a disaster area, man. I can't even sleep in my own bed 'cause it's so full of crap, and my cat has taken over. She's always in there and whenever I come in, she growls at me. It's kinda scary.
-Eat healthy
I'm trying to go vegan. For now, I'm not going to be very strict about it, but no more milk, and very little cheese.

Yeah, that was my boring entry. I think I'll go play The Sims now."

"event","So yeah, I'm not going up north skiing anymore. I think we all knew that was going to happen sooner or later, I was just waiting for the day when it would be gone, and the day came. Ever since Dad said we were going up north after New Year's, I would ask him every day... ""Dad, are we still going up north?"" ""Sure we are."" But then when I asked on Friday, he said, ""Uh, well, the skiing situation is a bit, er, <i>iffy</i> right now."" Iffy=we're not going, unless there's some sort of miracle. My dad always plans these trips to go up north camping or skiing or whatever, and then at the last minute he'll tell us he's not collecting enough money from his customers, or something to that effect, and we're not going. It happens so much that now, when he says we're going on a trip, I don't take him seriously. Hell, I even make plans on the days we're supposed to be going. But I was sooo looking forward to going skiing at Boyne and all that I guess it kinda blurred my outlook on reality and I thought that we actually might go this time. Which was STUPID. My dad has like no painting jobs right now, I mean, none. Whatsoever. He's home all the time because there's no work to do. So he's not getting paid, and we can't go up north, unless someone buys his old truck that he finally put up for sale by tomorrow, and no one's going to buy that piece of crap. He was talking to me this morning about possible dates because the ski trip will ""most likely be postponed."" I didn't pay attention. When he asked what days I had no school, and when mid-winter break was, I was just like, ""I don't know."" And I wasn't willing to go and check, because I don't care anymore. ""Postponed"". Our trips, 90% of the time, get ""postponed"", and pushed so far back that we never end up going on them. Blaaah! I know I'm making no sense right now but I'm just getting really pissed. This happens all the time!!! Grr..

Anyway, I'm not sure if I want to make the varsity ski team anymore. I guess I really don't have a choice. There's not enough girls to make up even a full varsity team, so basically every girl will be making varsity, no matter how bad we suck, and I suck pretty badly. If I make varsity, it would be cool to get my letter freshman year and all, but then I have to race against varsity-skilled people, and then I'll lose every time, and make a fool out of myself. In the beginning, I thought I was doing good, given my level, and not having any racing experience, and all that. But I don't think I'm improving. Hell, it seems like I'm getting worse. Whenever I get finished with a run, and I think I did really well, the coach will come up to me and name all the things I didn't do right. It's like this... ""Alex...good work!"" or ""Alex...much improved!"" and then he'll turn to me and be like... ""Val. You need to lean forward more, and concentrate on rolling the knee, and blah blah, and blah blah."" I love to ski, and practice is fun most of the time, but sometimes I get so frustrated and I beat myself up about it. Then I try too hard, and I end up falling, or straddling a gate, or something stupid like that, 'cause I'm so up tight. Aaaah! Time trials are the day we get back from vacation, and then we have a meet, like, the day after...

Okay, next complaint. I have no time to practice my piano anymore. I've been working on the same freaking song for more weeks than I can count. It's true that I've been playing more difficult music, and it takes longer to complete it, but since I haven't been practicing and I have to spend so much time catching up and reviewing during my lessons, it's really holding me back. After every lesson, I always tell myself that this week it'll be different, and I'll find time to practice, and I'll try harder. But I never have time and that never happens.

I'm dreading going back to school already. I'm really thankful they extended it to January 6th. It gives me comfort that I still have about a week left..."

On Christmas Eve all I ate was junk, yesterday most of what I ate was junk, and today all I've eaten is junk. The effects are starting to take its toll. I can practically feel my body's lack of nutrients. I feel tired and when I move around my stomach sloshes. My skin feels greasy from all the chocolate I've been eating and I'm breaking out. I'm probably dehydrated 'cause I haven't drunk any water, just Pepsi. I did have some Ocean Spray cranberry juice, but like that commercial says, it's only 18% juice, and then it's mostly water and corn syrup. Behold, the consquences of eating unhealthy!!

"event","Well, Christmas has come and gone. It was great, but something about this year was different. I didn't get as excited about it as I used to. Maybe it was because it was at my dad's house this year, and when I'm over there on Christmas, it's never as fun as it is at my mom's. Still, at times I completely forgot that it was Christmas at all. I woke up later than I ever did on Christmas morning (usually I'm up as early as five 'cause I get so excited), and I was just like, ""Oh yeah. It's Christmas."" Then I looked out the window, and I saw the ground blanketed with snow...we had a white Christmas after all, and that really made me smile, even though the snow waited until the very last minute to get it's job done. It must have been nearly two AM before the white stuff finally started coming down. Anyway, as soon as I woke up I had really really bad cramps, and since it's not ttotm, it must have been from all that chocolate I ate on Christmas Eve from my stocking. All I ate was Lindor truffles, Rolos, chcolate Santas, slices of chocolate orange, then a slice of cheese pizza and a breadstick for dinner, and for dessert, a lot of sugar cookies. It seemed so yummy at the time!! So yeah, I didn't feel well enough to go to church, which I felt really bad about, and not well enough to go to my grandparent's, which I felt bad about, too, but I was kind of relieved. Last year, Christmas dinner was a disaster since it was my first one as a vegetarian. You would think that Thanksgiving would have been worse, but then there was tons of meatless side dishes, and if you pile enough on your plate, no one notices you skipped the turkey. But at Christmas, there was ham, lasagna with meat sauce, Jell-O (made out of animal bones), etc. The only thing meatless was the deserts, and when I got some cookies, my dad started yelling at me, in front of my entire family, about how I have to eat something nutritional. I told him I would if there was something not made out of animal. Then he went on to insult my ""stupid diet"", and blah blah blah. The whole table was staring at me, and finally my aunt said something like ""For goodness sake, Jimmy, it's Christmas Eve, let her eat what she wants!"" and that shut him up. So you can understand why I wasn't too eager to go. Blah. It's been really hard being a vegetarian, since my dad's family is totally meat-eating, they even put bacon in the freaking salad. But I have to remember my morals! Okay, I'm like jumping from topic to topic.

Anyway, I dragged myself out of bed so I could open up my presents. In my stocking, there was a warpped present that said ""To Val & Steph, from Santa"". It was a Men in Black II DVD that I saw sitting on the counter a few days earlier. I think my mom never filled my mom in that my sister and I are over the Santa thing...but you'd think that he'd figure it out all by himself. I mean, I'm in high school, and my sister is in middle school. But alas, as soon as he gets out of bed, he says, ""Did Santa come??"" and my sister says, lamely, ""Yeeeah..."". And then, get this, he says ""Ohh! You girls must have been good this year!!"" Heh heh...my dad makes me chuckle.

So from my dad I got ski socks (as usual, even though I've warned him various times that you shouldn't fill your kids stocking with SOCKS, unless they're cool socks, and I wouldn't trust him to be the judge of what ""cool socks"" are, anyway...he'd probably be like, ""but ski socks ARE cool!!""), this desk bed thing, a portable CD player, earrings, and a pack of burnable CDs. I've already burned one of the CDs and I'm listening to it on my new CD player right now...woah, I just had a deja vu of myself writing that sentence, lol. It doesn't seem like much, but he bought me all of my ski stuff, too...my new skis, ski poles, ski boots, ski pass. If you add that to my new coat, snow pants, gloves, hat, and boot bag, which my mom got for me, it all adds up to about two grand...so I'm really not complaining.

Christmas Eve was at my mom's, so we went through our stocking in the morning and opened 3 or 4 presents throughout the day, then opened the rest in the evening. My mom got me a lot more than expected, which she always does. There were books, including the Moulin Rouge movie book, which is awesome, Olivia the Pig stuffed pig, Olivia the Pig journal (complete with an Olivia the Pig pen!), the Moulin Rouge soundtrack, volume two (includes the song ""Like a Virgin"", heh heh), vegetarian cookbooks, thermal socks and underwear (she's concerned about me getting too cold when I'm skiing, lol), a sling bag that I can carry my ski boots around with (I've been using grocery bags), a hat that matches my ski coat, a calendar, an origami kit, along with a ""Guide to Origami"" book, lotion, toe socks (THOSE are classified as cool socks), gel pens, cool mechanical pencils (this sounds geeky, but they really are cool looking, okay??), a deck of cards, candy, a book on ""How to Succeed in High School""...there's probably more that I'm forgetting. There was so much though, and I'm really grateful that my mom did all this for me.

So yeah, it was a merry Christmas, but it wasn't the same in so many ways. I don't know, maybe it just came too fast and I wasn't ready for it, or maybe the magic's gone for me. Even so, I can't forget what Christmas is really about. I don't wanna get sappy or all religious or anything, lol, so I'll leave it at that.

I hope that everyone had a Merry Christmas and that you all have good luck in the new year."

My mom is really sick again. It was just about two weeks ago that she had the same thing and was throwing up, literally, every ten minutes, and she's got something again. She thinks there might have been something in the food at this holiday party she had at work, and she got sick so badly that she had to sit in the bathroom all night. I feel really bad and I'm really worried about her. Like I wrote earlier, she has been really stressed out, and it seems like whenever she gets some time to herself, something comes up, like today. When she's not working her 12 hour shifts, she's usually flying to a different state on a business trip for extra money. We don't really need it or anything, at least I think we don't, but it makes up for Dad not paying child support. And she does all that on her days off, too. It's just all too much, both for my mom and for my sister and I. Bceause we've all been so busy, we haven't even had a chance to get a Christmas tree yet, and we were going to do that today, but my dad had to take us instead since my mom needs rest. Blah...I just feel like I should be doing something for her, and even if I had the time to, there's really nothing I could do.

"event","Last night was really fun. I went to the concert with Louise and we hung out with Shannon for awhile, but she had to leave at around 6:30. The music was good, but there wasn't really anyone we knew there, so we kinda just wandered around the school for awhile. There was a swim meet against Brighton going on, so of course Louise wanted to check it out, it being against Brighton and all. It's ""her second school"", says Louise. We left after a few minutes, but planned to come back later, but when we got back, there was this lady there charging money to get in! It was $3 for each of us, so we wandered around some more for like 2 hours, talking, looking for money. While Louise was searching in her locker for some change, this janitor asked us what we were doing and after we explained he started telling us all these ways we could sneak in to the pool, but we thought that was too risky. I ran into Val, my name-sharing pal, and we hung out with him for awhile till we got some money from someone and went back to the meet. They were doing diving so no one could talk, and it was all hot and muggy, so after about 20 minutes of that we got bored and left.
...It sounds really boring, now that I read what I wrote, but it really was fun! Me 'n' Louie had some pretty ""interesting"" conversations. Matt, her friend who lives in Brighton, thinks I'm hott. He's never seen me before, but hey, who can blame him?? Heh heh...

Mrs. Goff gave us more things to color today. My God, that lady does not know how to teach. Instead of teaching us about cells, she gives us a coloring packet and mentions ""we'll have a test on the material, oh by the way"". How does coloring help us learn?! ""I know what a nucleoplasm is because I colored it <i>orange</i>!"" Oh, please. This is the kinda stuff we would do back in second grade when coloring was considered a privilege. It'd just be to keep us quiet while we got high off of the scented markers (not that we knew what getting high was), and nowadays coloring is like a punishment, and we still get high off the scented markers...this time around we know what it is, lol. But no, Mrs. Goff thinks we're actually learning something, so she doesn't have to teach. She can just sit at her desk and think to herself, ""What comic will I show the class today?""

I've got a fun-filled night of homework and ski practice ahead of me, so I better get going. At least I have Friday to look forward to. I'm going to Jessica's holiday party and, er, *people* will be there, if you catch my drift.

<b>Me and you,
And you and me.
No matter how they toss the dice
It had to be
The only one for me is you
And you for me
So happy together...
How is the weather?</b>

I believe in you and me. I will never leave your side. I will never hurt your pride. Just to be right where you are. My love. You know I love you. I will never leave you out. I will always let you win! The places no one's ever been...deep inside. Can't you see? That I believe and me. 

I believe in dreams again. I believe that love will never end. And like the river finds the sea...I was lost...now I'm free. 'Cause I believe in you and me."

"event","Wahoo, I actually have some time today. I don't have to go to ski practice, but I do have to go to this holiday charity concert, it's a mandatory student council thing. It lasts from five to nine, but at least I don't have to leave for practice right after I get home and then be all exhausted from skiing when I get back. Maybe I won't have to stay the whole time.

I'm feeling really bad for my mom. She works really hard for me and my sister, and she never has time to spend time with us, let alone with herself. As a result, the house is always a mess, which stresses her out even further. I help out as often as I can but it's hard to do much, now that I have practice and all this homework. And the only reason she needs to work so much is because my dad doesn't pay child support all the time. I know he can't afford to pay it every week, but that's because he has a crappy job, and it's his fault! He's so smart - he was going to U of M and had a major in economics. He was on the honor roll and everything, but he quit! My grandma, who has a lot of money, was even paying for it, too, so there was no excuse. He dropped out of college so he could go and be the owner of a painting business...impressive, eh? Anyway, I'll get more into that later...

But my mom has had such a bad week so far. All weekend she was like horribly ill and was throwing up every half hour. On Sunday night she woke up at about two in the morning and didn't get back to sleep...she does that a lot. And then last night she was on call at the hospital. They called her in about the time I was going to sleep and she didn't get back until I was leaving for school in the morning. She's on call tonight, too, which means she'll probably miss my sister's band concert, and it's really important to my sister that my mom's there. Grr...I just feel like she shouldn't have to go through all this. 

Time to hit the books."

Don't have much to write, besides that there's no way I can get this rough draft for English done all by myself! and after today, I know Mrs. Pump will take no excuses...she doesn't <b>care</b>, she even said so herself. Rah. She needs some..therapy, or something similar to that. So she can get it through her chipper little mind that people are human and sometimes can't be ""awesome""."

"event","As expected I didn't get a chance to update yesterday, and I barely have time to write anything today. I almost feel like I have no time to myself anymore. I come home after a hard day at school, and I have about 15-20 minutes to take a break and eat a snack. Almost immediately I have to get my stuff together for skiing, because I carpool with Alex C. and she has to leave at 3:30 with her dad (he coaches the Western ski team and their practice starts at four). When we get to Alpine, we go to the loadge and do the homework for about 45 minutes, then we get our stuff on and hit the slopes. Practice ends at seven, so I get home at about 7:30 by the time we drop Alex off and everything. If I don't have to buy food or clothes or something like that, which is unlikely, I can go home and eat, then I work on my homework some more, which usually lasts until about ten or 10:30. By the time I'm ready for bed it's about eleven, and then I have to get up at five the next morning and the cycle begins again...

Yeah. So now I have to get ready for practice (woo hoo!), then it's homework, skiing, working on a project at Erin's, more homework, bedtime.

And so ends the tale of Val's boring life. I'll try and update later, but I doubt I'll have time."

"event","Yay! I finally have a LiveJournal so I can be cool like everyone else. I've wanted one for a long time and finally I ust decided to pay the five bucks and get one. I love having a journal but I don't have time to sit down and write anymore so having one on a computer where I can type what I feel, and quickly, is great. Unfortunately, I really have nothing interesting to write about, even if this is my first entry. I'm feeling really blah right now...unproductive, 'cause I haven't done anything useful, yet exhausted.

I didn't do anything too exciting today...surprise, surprise. I got my ink pad for my <i>Where's George?</i> (www.WheresGeorge.com) stamp today, so now I can start defacing U.S. currency again...fun stuff, eh? My mom and I went to Olive Garden and I stuffed my face, then we did some Christmas shopping at Borders for my sister. She's at the hospital with my grandpa right now. He has some kind of infection on his leg and he'll need to stay there for a day or two, so it's nothing serious. ...Yeah, that was a bunch of boring stuff you don't really care about.

So I was here all by myself until my dad and my sister came home, and now they're having some precious couch time in the living room. Mom just came home, and I still have more to write, so I'll try and update later.

"event","Well, school starts up again on Monday, the 29th.  I am excited and dreading all at the same time.  I will miss my days of sleeping in, but then again my earliest class is at like 12 so I guess I dont have to worry to much.  Not much else is going on.  T Ro is home on Spring Break so me and him have been rockin and rollin as usual.  I had a crush for like a week but then lost it.  Rejection is never fun.  Oh well life goes on.  I saw Eternal Sunshine, and it was amazing.  Good ol' Charlie is sooo gifted.  I cant get over his writing.  Fantastic!!!  Im so glad it is finally nice out.  I went out without a coat the other day and I was so excited.  Well I know this post is boring but I must be off to work now. Hooray for Crate.  Until next time, have a blast.

"event","Hello children of the internet,

It has been a very long time since I last posted.  Sad to say, not much has changed.  I got tickets to Phantom of the Opera and Rent both in Chicago.  Thats exciting.  I decided I wanted to do new things and get some culture...ya know, hit the town. So that is my start.  I like plays and musicals, Im not gonna lie, they're fun.  It's finally getting a little warm outside and thats always fun.  It's almost time to hit the porch with the acoustic and chill the days/nights away.  I can't wait.  It wont be quite the same without everyone, but thats ok, out with the old and in with the new.  School is starting up for me soon, thats a plus.  No more dickin around and dropping classes....March 29 seriousness sets in.  Sometimes I wish I could go back to simpler times.  Worrying about playgrounds and skateboards and all that good stuff.  Im a kid at heart anyways, this growing up stuff really isnt my style.  We should all just have a good time.  Im gonna start pimpin the ladies....JK girls.  Itd be nice to date, who knows maybe even find a gf or something.  If not its a nice thought.  I dont really have anything else to say, and its almost time for me to sing at the top of my lungs in the shower.  Until next time.

Rock n Roll

"event","Hey all...how is everyone doing tonight?  Im doing all right myself.  I should be sleeping cause I have to work in the morning but Im not tired.  Valentines Day just ended and I didnt have a valentine.  Its the first time in a while that I havent and I thought it would be tough but I was suprisingly ok with it all.  Life is going ok and I just wanted to say hello to everyone.  Unfortunately I dont have any words of wisdom, quotes, or stories.  I know Im a disappointment, but what can ya do. Have a nice day.  Rock out like woah.

"event","So boys and girls after much thought and consideration I decided not to join the band.  I wasnt as serious as I should have been and instead I chose to get my life on track with school and working and my future.  Who would have ever thought that I would choose school over something.  I suppose there is a first for everything. I still wanna party with them cause G is my man and K hak is awesome as well.  Do you ever think about things like fate and why life leads us the way it does? I dont I was just wondering.  Well COD Im on my way, then Columbia look out you're next. Rock n roll.  If anyone knows a quick and easy way to be amazing at piano Id like to know the secret.  Have a nice day, dont fall in.

"event","Remember back in the day when all you wanted was a girlfriend, more than anything ever, and you'd listen to depressing music about girls being mean and about how you're looking for the one, or what have you, and you'd put up away messages to make sure everyone who has your screename knew just how sensitive and available you were-yeah, back when shit was real...that was cool... I wanna thank T-Ro for that interesting little rant.  It's so true though.  Forget girlfriends, they're overrated anyways. Anyways, today I jammed with Dave and that was fun and now I am done with my chores and such and Im sitting until band practice.  Catch 22 is a good book, if you haven't read it you should. Other than that, have a nice day.  Live long and prosper.

<P><FONT color=#3333ff>Here it is, my first post.&nbsp; How exciting!!! I know you are all as excited as I am because you're here reading this...meaning youre bored and I am bored so Im here writing, funny how things work out like that eh.&nbsp; So what do I write about now....I went to work today, that was fun.&nbsp; Have you ever wondered why people always have cool shit to do but when you come around it seems that nothing is happening.&nbsp;Kinda similar to the situation where if you're hanging out with people and decide to call it a night early&nbsp; like five minutes after you go the party starts bumpin and you missed ""the best night.""&nbsp; What kinda bull is that, I dunno maybe it just happens to me.&nbsp; So tomorrow I am going to play some tunes with Dave.&nbsp; Hes a neat guy, with a pretty rockin band, I might join or they might decide they hate me and cut my balls off.&nbsp; You never know, shit goes down like that out here in the ville. Then after our jamming comes time for the band to come around and fuck stuff up with their good looks being a distraction.&nbsp; We call this action practice.&nbsp; Cross your fingers and hope I can rock out like Ben Folds, well ok who am I kidding, but thatd be nice wouldnt it.&nbsp; Well today was the day of........not much, hopefully tomorrow will be better.&nbsp; Until next time peace, love, and for the love of God, wrap it up.</FONT></P>

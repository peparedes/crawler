I went to orientation at NHS yesterday.  They fixed my schedule, and it totally rocks.  I don't have to be at school 'til 2nd period.  I'm taking Guitar I, Government Honors, Musical Theatre, Physics Honors, Physical Education (only for half the year- yes!), Duel-Enrollment English, and more Musical Theatre.  And Latin II via Florida Virtual School.  Whee!  I found all my classes, but I forgot most of them.  I have Mrs. Elaine three times a day, so that's pretty groovy.  Caitlin, she's Ricky and Haley Pearson's mom, remember?  Anyway.  I made two new friends, Katie (Justin's ex-rebound... I mean ex-girlfriend) and Derek.  Now I'll know... seven people.  Whee!  Oh yah, I saw two people from the Academy who are transferring.  Tee hee.

Our first show (for sponsors) was last night.  It rocked.  Joseph was a little late for his first song and he was soooo nervous, but it was grood.  I gave him a ""French kiss"" for good luck.  PAH HA!  (FYI, we did the cheek-kissing thing- NOT lips, lol)  Anyway.  Mmm, what else?  Oh yah.  After the show we all hit up Huddle House (Pierce said that if he ever opened a restaurant he would call it ""Cuddle House""- HAHAHAHAHA!) for some totally pawesome (lol, Jess) food.  And Pierce called me fat.  lol

Okay, attention span expired.  By the way, does anyone even READ this anymore?

Back to your dark eyes,

Marry me when I return, Darlene,
And until that day, my love,
Take care.

Be thee well.
May the Lord who watches all watch over thee.
May God's heaven be your blanket as you softly sleep.

"event","I have a theory.  I think that our level of expectancy affects what happens in our lives.  For example, the last two hurricanes that were extremely devastating were named Ivan and Dennis.  <pause>  Hellooooo?  ""Ivan the Terrible"" and ""Dennis the Menace,"" as these hurricanes were appropriately nicknamed, are historical and imaginary names characterized by terror and annoyance.  Therefore, when everyone started making a big deal about the storms and their names, their expectancy that the storms would be really horrible grew.  And don't tell me they named them after they formed, because the weather people choose the names for the season's hurricanes before the season even starts.  Maybe we should choose hurricane names like Bob.  No one hears the name ""Bob"" and shudders in fear, do they?  Unless they know someone named Bob who's in the Mafia... but anyway.

Example Number Two: When we go to youth camp in June, everyone who goes expects God to do something awesome.  You can almost feel it in the atmosphere as you walk around the premises.  And God does rock.  Because people expect Him to.  Think about what would happen if we took the same expectancy that we have at church camp and during hurricane season and took it to our youth groups and churches.  We would have a totally awesome move of God.

Well, that's my theory.  Comment if you wish."

All-State Drama was an absolute BLAST!  I had an awesome time, and I actually made friends this year!  lol  Props to Shavo, my twin.

Two weeks 'til school starts.  Man, this summer has flown.  I'm starting a new school (again).  I think it'll be easier than last year.  Except for the whole eight-classes-a-day-and-starting-class-at-7:20 thing.  Ouch...  Oh, well.  It shall be UBER!

"event","Man, this weekend was totally sweet.  Friday night Shea and I took our dads on a double date for Father's Day.  Caitlin was s'posed to go, but... she didn't.  Anyway, we saw Cinderella Man, which is an excellent movie, and ate at Applebee's.  It was kind of awkward because everyone was staring at us... probably thinking, ""What are those two old guys doing with those teenage girls?""  lol  I missed Summer Survivor, which I heard was extremely fun (frisbee football and a relay race with a pickled pig's foot for a baton-- Whee!).

Saturday I went to Christie and Allen's wedding.  It was sooooo pretty, and Christie's dress was absolutely gorgeous.  The reception was really nice, also.  The food was catered by McGuire's, and it was sooooo good!  They had a fountain-type thing of CHOCOLATE for us to dip strawberries in.  Oh.  Man.  That was soooo good.

After the reception, Shea and I went home to change, then we joined Amber, Lee, Meagan, Whitney, Alissa, and Amber's cousin Ryan (no comment, Shea) for bowling in Pensacola.  It was so much fun.  We didn't get home 'til about 2 in the morning, though.  That made it slightly difficult to get up for church, lol.

Sunday after morning church I went to Amber's house, where we watched the guys play Halo.  I actually killed Josh one time.  Hurray!

Dude.  I wanna see Star Wars.

"event","Once upon a time, there lived a sweet little girl named Susie.  She lived a simple, happy life in the land of Pleasantville.  All was well in Susie's life until the eve of her tenth birthday.  You see, on that quiet, dark night Susie went for her annual Birthday Eve Walk around the park.  It was a relatively calm walk this year, but then Susie saw a cute little bunny.  Susie was so happy; she always wanted a bunny for a pet, so she stepped off the Magic Birthday Eve Walkway and approached the cute little bunny.

Suddenly, the bunny scampered off into the Dark Evil Forest.  Without heeding the DO NOT ENTER signs or even the name of the forest, Susie quickly followed the bunny.  Within moments, the Dark Evil Forest closed around Susie, shutting out the futile light of the moon.  Susie took a few more steps in the direction she thought the bunny went then stopped, terrified.  She looked around slowly, but the action was hopeless; she could not see a thing.

Eerie sounds of the Dark Evil Forest filled Susie's ears, and the girl released a small cry in her fear.  Minutes passed, then hours, but Susie remained frozen in place.  Bushes rustled, trees swayed in the breeze, but Susie did not twitch a muscle.

Weeks passed, and finally a search party found a hair ribbon that her parents confirmed was Susie's.  They had to detangle the ribbon from the teeth of a small rabbit, and they continued to search for the girl to no avail.

She was never seen again.

"event","Yesterday morning I woke up extra-early for the Shakespeare Festival.  I arrived at school around 7:15 and rode the church van with Wynne, Melanie, Kerrianne, Kaylie, and... some guys.  They don't count.  Anyway, we had like six vehicles going to Montgomery.  When we finally arrived, I immediately noticed the looks we were receiving.  Envious glances shot our way as all the other kids wished they had button-up white shirts and plaid, pleated skirts.  Or khaki pants, for the guys.  But ya never know these days...

So we went inside the building.  It was sooo cool.  Kerrianne and I wanted to see The Taming of the Shrew instead, so sometime during the opening act of All My Sons (by Arthur Miller) we snuck out.  It was kinda hard, but it was also really dark.  A little crawling, a little running, and we were outta there.  You'd think that was the hardest part, but then we had to find the theatre we wanted.  It involved quite a bit of wandering around and asking people who looked important.  ""Which theatre is The Taming of the Shrew in?""  ""No, we got separated from our group.""  Et cetera.

Anyway, after about 10 minutes we finally found it.  We cracked the door open a little and tried to wait for a black-out so we could sneak in.  Then we got tired of waiting and just walked in and sat down by some cute guys like we totally belonged there.  Nevermind the fact that we were the only Catholic schoolgirls there.  Anyway.  We stayed for about 30 or 40 minutes.  Kerrianne wanted to get back a little while before intermission so we wouldn't be missed.  We snuck in alright; we were both so scared Mrs. Sasser was gonna see us. (""Uhhh, we had to go to the bathroom?"")  Anyway, the parts of All My Sons that we DID see were really good.  At one point, the main character took his shirt off, and he had some niiiiice muscles.

After intermission (Next time I'm making a sign that says, ""Escambia Academy, and yes, we know our uniforms rock and you wish you had some"" so I don't have to keep SAYING it to people.) Kerrianne and I considered watching some more Shakespeare, but there weren't any more black-outs.

The ride home wasn't quite as eventful.  We ate at CiCi's (EW!).  There was a Dairy Queen like on the other side of the parking lot, but NOOOO, we couldn't go there.  I hate CiCi's.  I absolutely LOVE Dairy Queen, though.  Anyway.  Kerrianne and I probably could have snuck over there, but one act of disobedience is probably enough for us for one day.  Besides, it's really funny seeing how many people run into the door when they can't open it (I can't believe Buckie figured it out first!).

We stopped at a rest station on the way back to school.  I got some orange Fanta, a Snickers bar, and some M&M's cookies since I barely ate at that crap restaurant.

Some people are SO annoying.

...

Why won't they just shut up??

Anyway, that was pretty much my day yesterday.  I didn't get to eat Jalisco's last night because church got out late, but it's all gravy.  I wish that guy would just stay and be OUR youth pastor, lol.

Okay, everybody who wishes they had an awesome uniform like mine comment, please!"

VATICAN CITY- Following is the text of Pope Benedict XVI's first address to the world after being elected as the first German pope since the 11th century.  He delivered the address in Italian from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilca:

Dear brothers and sisters,

After the Great Pope John Paul II, the cardinals have elected me, a simple, humble worker in the Lord's vineyard.  I am comforted by the fact that the Lord knows how to work and act even with insufficient instruments.  And above all, I entrust myself to your prayers.  With the joy of the risen Lord and confidence in his constant help, we will go forward.  The Lord will help us and Mary his most holy mother will be alongside us.

Thank you.

OH, YEAH!  I had my first wreck yesterday.  My baby's a little dented, but it wasn't that bad.  I hyperventilated, too.  I couldn't breathe for like... 10 minutes.  My dad and Patty weren't mad, though.

I hope I don't get skin cancer.  I have a farmer's tan, now.  And a tan line from my watch and my bracelets.  We got a new student in our class yesterday.  He came here last year, but I wasn't here.  His name is Branden Moore.  He has cool hair.

Hmmm, I still can't concentrate on anything.  I think I might have to skip tennis practice today.  I have to take my baby to the shop, and we have to figure out where to have prom pictures.  We might have them at my house.  Whee!

I miss Jimmy.

GOSH I'm so BORED!

Spring Break is just not fun when you have nothing to do."

"event","Ya know what I hate?  Having to hurt someone whom I really care about.  The worst part?  I don't want to do it.  Hurting this person is seriously the farthest thing from my mind.  Why did I do it, then?  My parents made me.  Yes.  My parents made me rip out the heart of the one guy I really cared about and stomp on it.  Not to mention my heart, which has been seriously battered by now.  This really sucks.  I hate it.  All I want to do is be with this person, but can I do that?  No.  This sucks.  Again.





I'll tell you flat out
It hurts so much to think of this
So from my thoughts I will exclude
The very thing that
I hate more than everything is
The way I'm powerless
To dictate my own moods

I've thrown away
So many things that could've been much more
And I just pray
My problems go away if they're ignored
But that's not the way it works
No, that's not the way it works

When I go down
I go down hard
And I take everything I've learned
And teach myself some disregard
When I go down
It hurts to hit the bottom
And of the things that got me there
I think, if only I had fought them

If and when I can
Clear myself of this clouded mind
I'll watch myself settle down
Into a place where
Peace can search me out and find
That I'm so ready to be found

I've thrown away
The hope I had in friendships
I've thrown away
So many things that could have been much more
I've thrown away
The secret to find an end to this
And I just pray
My problems go away if they're ignored
But that's not the way it works
No, that's not the way it works

When I go down
I go down hard
And I take everything I've learned
And teach myself some disregard
When I go down
It hurts to hit the bottom
And of the things that got me there
I think, if only I had fought them

Any control I thought I had just slips right through my hands
While my ever-present conscience shakes its heads and reprimands me
Reprimands me
Then and there
I confess
I'll blame all this on my selfishness
Yet you love me
And that consumes me
And I'll stand up again
And do so willingly

You give me hope, and hope it gives me life
You touch my heavy heart, and when you do you make it light
As I exhale I hear your voice
And I answer you, though I hardly make a noise
And from my lips the words I choose to say
Seem pathetic, but it's a fallen man's praise
Because I love you
Oh, God, I love you
And life is now worth living
If only because of you
And when they say I'm dead and gone
It won't be further from the truth

When I go down
I lift my eyes to you
I won't look very far
Cause you'll be there
With open arms
To lift me up again
To lift me up again"

I had a date for prom... for about a day.

Did I mention this really pulls?"

Friday I went to Pensacola and saw the President of the United States!!

...Okay, that's seriously all.

Oh.  And I got another prom dress.  (Yes, I am taking the other one back.)  It's so much more UBER than the other one.  Of course, I can't breathe in it, but a wise person once told me that ""You can't be beautiful and breathe at the same time."""

Mmm, not much else is going on.

OH YEAH!  I got the most pawesome CD ever!  It's The Very Best of the Beach Boys: Sounds of Summer.  It is so UBER!

I wanted one that said, ""Kiss me, I'm Irish,"" but the fear that someone would actually take me serious was too great.  Unfortunately, our party never made it past the initial discussion stage.  Quite distressing, I know, but whatever.  Ryan Woods says hi."

"event","Well.  As I mentioned, Monday night was Reading Relay.  It was quite fun.  We all watched Napoleon Dynamite, ate a ton of junk food, played ""Bus,"" and (my personal favorite) piled all the sleeping bags and pillows in one big mountain and took turns jumping in them!  It was so uber.  Yeah, I forgot to bring Back to the Future, but we had enough to keep us occupied.  I dozed off a little, and yesterday I slept until about 2:30.  Oh, yeah.  Rey finally called me.  And the peasants rejoiced..."

Tonight my whole class gets to stay at the school all night and read/watch TV/play video games/talk on the phone or Linc/eat/whatever.  I've never been to one of this things, but it should be fun.  So, if ANYONE (*cough* Renald) wants to call me, I'll have my cell phone.  And my Linc.  Dot dot dot...  Okay.

Oh, yeah.  Ryan Woods is feeling neglected by the Milton people.  EVERYBODY CALL HIM!"

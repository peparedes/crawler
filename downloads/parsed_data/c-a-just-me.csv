"event","<p>Lately I have been thinking about my life and the way I live it. There was a time that I didn't question myself and seriously did not give a fuck about other people. Then I fell in love... and nothing happened. I hurt someone who loved me very much all due to my fucked up selfishness.&nbsp; I moved on after breaking his hearth. It wasn't long before I fell in love again, with someone who was as fucked up as me. I love him a lot and he loves me. His selfishness wasn't&nbsp; bigger than mine, but his insecurities are. He too loves me with all his hearth, he loves me so much is suffocating.&nbsp; I am trying to change and be more aware of his feelings and needs, and I have gone a long way, and it is still not enough. Why can't he see how much progress I have made?&nbsp; It's always been interesting to me how easy it is for people to judge one another, and how easy it is to forget all the good stuff somone does the second they make a mistake &nbsp;(the last statement might be a bit biased, since I am the king of mistakes).&nbsp;&nbsp;I might be selfish,&nbsp; and rebeliuos, but I do have a lot of compassion in people, I&nbsp; try to see things on the positive side (at least since the last year), and that's why I get so frustrated and upset when others, especially my boyfriend, only focus on the negative side of things...<br /><br />So my boyfriend doesn't trust me, and that sucks, especially after all the personal growth I have done inspired by him.&nbsp; I think he is good for me, because a lot of the times he is right on point about stupid shit I do, but sometimes he is way wrong. Like he doesn't seem to understand that I have grown. He sees me as the crazy wild kid I once was. He thinks I can't take care of myself, that I will continue to party until my body cant take it, and he thinks that I will continue to make stupid decisions. Which is all ridiculous taking into consideration my current social life. I hardly go out, I don't drink nearly as much as I used to, and the only illegal drug I do now is weed, and not&nbsp; a lot.&nbsp;It makes me upset when people judge you from shit you've done before, not taking into consideration that you might have changed for the better.&nbsp; I mean, why the hell would I pretend I cared if I didn't.&nbsp; It is easier to go out and get wasted and wild than stay home alone and be bored...&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, i guess I got away from my title.... I was told that I am rebeliuos as a defense mechanism (first by my therapist, and today my boyfriend). I have been thinking about that, and I have to say I agree. But if i didn't feel attacked or misunderstood then I wouldn't be rebeliuos.&nbsp; I have to admit that I HATE feeling like I am under someone's control.&nbsp; I always have. I guess that's why I was so selfish for a long time. but now I feel as if I can differentiate between being contolled and taking someone into consideration.&nbsp; I have learned that I can't do whatever I want, especially if what I want might cause pain to others.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />ugh, I feel so melodramatic right now... I mean I am not one to show emotions so easily, but I like writing stuff, so i guess I'll just go back to the drama.... god I feel as if I was high (if I was I wouldn't feel so shitty). Like, I just read my blog and it doesn't make much sense... I guess Im emotionally drained and intellectually retarded at the moment...&nbsp; It all makes sense in my head most of the time... that's a wrap.</p>"

"event","<p>WOW, It has been almost two years since my last entry...&nbsp; after a sad night of long reflection and travel through my life I remember about this journal... I've read all&nbsp; my entries, and boy have I changed. While reading through the lines&nbsp;I can feel the excitment when I was typing them years ago... so juvenile and naive, rushing desperately through my life, looking desoerately for love, looking desperately to fit into this world I had just been introduced to. finding friends and loving people who didn't even love theirselves. Of course there is also the other side, the side where I was so positive and full of life, so eager to live, and very few true friends. Looking back at the whole thing I'm happy things went that way. Am I the same person? Maybe the essentials are the same, but now&nbsp; I am more sure of myself. I knwo who I am and I don not need any approval or acceptance from anyone. In the last couple of years I've been to busy to update this, I guess I was too busy truly living my life, finding real love, finding real friends, having the best time of my life. Thank you to everyone who has made an impact in my life, to everyone else be true to yourself and live YOUR life (not what you think your life should be), and to my love... it won't be long before soon.</p>"

"event","Today I had a second interview at Urban. IT WENT GREAT! I got there and asked for James, the manager who interviewed me last time and he told me another manager was going to interview me today, she was this really cool girl, Brook i think her name was. Heading to Sturbucks, where the interview was going to be held, we were talking about my past jobs, and my experience... they loved the fact that I've worked in retail before. The interview lasted about 20 minutes, because Brook was really a charming person... we kept talking about random stuff and had a great time. Heading back to Urban she told me that I had really good chances of getting the job because James liked me a lot, and so did she!! They are going to talk with the general manager Monday, and she promissed me I will get a call that same day, or Tuesday definetely.  I am so exicted... Brook told me she loved my outfit and that I would fit right in the store... she was so nice!  Even though I've actually talked only to Brook and James, Urban's workers seem really nice... accorrding to Brook there's this great vive among co-workers, and that's something I definetly love... No drama, no stress... that's what makes the difference between crapy jobs and good ones.  I wanna ask you boos a favor, please keep your fingers crossed for me, I promisse I'll update as soon as I get the job.

<h2>Your Seduction Stye: ""Prized Object""</h2>
The seduction game you play is tried, true, and still effective: hard to get.<br><br>
You know that the best seducers turn the tables - and get their crush to seduce them.<br><br>
The one running has the power, and you're a challenge that is worth the chase.
<br><br><br>
You are a master of enticing and pulling back. Giving a little and taking some away.<br><br>
You are controlled enough to know rewards come after a long seduction dance.<br><br>
Even though you want to call, email, or say ""I love you"" first - you don't!
<br><br><br>
You're style is the perfect mix of hot and cold - so much so that you have many suitors<br><br>
Think Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany's ... or any of those creepy guys from the Bachelor<br><br>
You're skilled at inspiring a chase. The real test is picking the person to slow down for..

"event","So yeah, today's been a wonderful day... except for those stupid-ass dumb drivers that have been around me all day long! Anyway.  Today I got a call from Lynda Harrison, a U of A rep. who was working on my admission.  I got admitted!  It was so wonderful to hear ""Congrats Cesar, you've been admitted!"" I was so excited... Even though I knew i was going to get admitted it still was surprising and exciting.  I am putting my dorm application in next week, and we'll see what happens next. Hopefully I'll get a single dorm!  Things at home are fine. Funny, mom, my sis and I were watching Will and Grace, mom commented on Will: ""He's so cute, too bad he's gay"" to which my sis(8) replied: ""Just like this one (ME)"" We all laughed,  although mom didn't think it was that funny after a while.  School's going great so far, everything's just fine. What else can I say... LIFE IS GOOD!

"event","Today has been a great day so far... I woke up around 10 and went to my acting class.  After that i went to my job interview at Urban Outfitters.. it went pretty well. the manager seemed to be really interested in my retail experience.. he kept talking about it! I got interviewed with two other girls, who seriously didn't feel like something i should worry about.  I am pretty confident about getting the job. Hopefully I'll start working soon.  After my interview I walked to Coronado with Karla, one of the girls from the interview.  She showed me her dorm and after that i headed downtown, where I met up with Chris and later on, Mike.  We had lunch at brooklyn were i  met this cute guy from Phoenix. His name's Renato and he's 25. He's cute in a weird way. After Brooklyn we went to Eon and here I am trying to pretend I'm not surrounded by trash, but is kind of hard... Hopefully I'll be somewhere else next time I update, until then... have fun boos!"

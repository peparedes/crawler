"event","Serena walked into class.  Today was the day they had to pick a career before the actual report writing started.  She was confident now she worked hard all night trying to think of something she could do.  It was around three in the morning when she got a glass of warm milk to drink and checked on Rini and Sammy before going back into her own room.  Then it hit her what she wanted to do.  Quickly she filled out the worksheet then went to bed.

She was tired from staying up so late but was proud of what she put.  As she walked past the teachers desk she put the paper down and smiled at her answer:
<center><i>Idea future career - Loving wife and mother.</center></i>
Smiling she headed to her desk to wait for class to start."

A few kids already had theirs approved and had started to work on their papers while she rushed to find something to do her report on.  ""I don't think future Queen of the moon Kingdom qualifies as a job but I don't know what to put.""  She fumed to herself before sighing and lying her head down.  ""I don't have any skills either this sucks."""

She heard something had happened to Amy at school last Thursday but wasn't sure what.  It had to be bad though because Amy almost missed this whole week of school.  When she did show up she stayed distant and would always wind up going home early.  Sighing Serena put her pencil down she knew she wouldn't be able to concentrate on her homework anyway.

Looking at her calendar she noticed Jim's birthday was a few days away.  /Maybe the party will cheer Amy up.  That is if she goes./ Serena thought to herself.  Serena thought going to the arcade with Mina for a little bit would help clear her head so grabbing some of her allowance and her shoes she ran out of her room."

"event","Hey guys!  Nothing much really to talk about.  Today is Raye's birthday.  Chad wanted to take her out on a private date while the rest of us wanted a party.  So Mina and I came up with this brilliant plan.  We showed up at the shrine around noon and had a party then and later she goes out with Chad.  Ain't I a genius?  Raye looked so surprised when we showed up at the shrine.  I got her a couple of framed pictures of beautifully written Haiku's.  Her room was a little bare and thought she could use some wall decorations.  Sadly I could only afford two.  They are expensive."

My mom said she doesn't mind since I was with Darien the man she wants me to marry and give her grand kids.  She is always overly nice during Valentines always telling me stories about when she was still in school.  Oops I almost forgot what I was supposed to be doing.

I gave Luna a special lunch and gave everyone the chocolates I made.  I hope they were at lest edible.  I made a special chocolate to Darien.  I went all out on decorating it.  

Well around noon we went to a cafe for lunch, that's when I gave him my valentine and he gave me his, then we went to a movie.  Afterwards we went to the art museum. . .cause I know he'd love it, then dinner at a nice restaurant.  Since I wasn't allowed to go back to his place (stupid school night) we just got ice cream and he walked me home.  Of course the best kiss of the day had to be the good night one.  I feel guilty though because I feel like he spent a little to much on me then I deserved.  I'll have to make sure that on White day I get him something that will really make it all up."

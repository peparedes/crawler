"event","A great deal has been happening, but I can't really be arsed posting about it.<br /><br />One notable event was 2 fridays ago, at the Opera House, where I attended a preformance called ""<a href=""http://www.supernaut.info/2006/11/feasting_on_flesh.html"">Feasting on Flesh</a>"".&nbsp; The poster for it had the following tagline -<em> ""A decadent and deranged degustation of perverse and provocative performance by proud purveyors of wanton weirdness!""</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />Part burlesque, part play, part modern dance performance, part circus, and then with a bit more burlesque. It stared, amongst others, Gypsy Wood, who recently toured with Dita Von Teese, and is simply stunning.&nbsp;<br />It was one of the most throughly enjoyable nights I've had all year, and the fact that Gotye played live to proivde the score certainly didn't hurt at all.&nbsp;<br />Fantastic.&nbsp;I would throughly reccomend it to everyone...But it has finished it run. Oh well.&nbsp;<br /><br />Arcturus are touring next year, and I'll be in America when they play Sydney. Typical. Dang.<br /><br />I cannot fucking believe it's less then a month 'till Xmas. Thats quite simply disturbing. Lucky for me I'm stone motherless broke, makes the whole gift giving enterprise a lot easier.&nbsp;<br /><br />And in closing, go see <strong>The Prestige</strong>. A fantastic headfuck of a movie, but then again I expected nothing less from Christopher Nolan.&nbsp;<br />9 out of 10, yet another contender for movie of the year (Seem to be saying that a lot lately...)<br /><br />"

And a set of Floyd classics.<br /><br />Lifes a funny thing, huh?<br /><br />Well, there goes the money I'd scrounged away for Lou Reed tickets!<br />I guess I'm a tad let down by this news though - I mean, I cannot wait for this, however, I'd heard a few months ago Coppel was looking to bring out either Waters or Gilmour - Not both though. Looks like Waters won out, so no Gilmour - And I know who'd I prefer by a long fucking shot.<br /><br />Still, this is going to be awesome. Sure, Waters voice is shot to hell, and his solo work is average at best, but his guitarist can bust out a good enough Gilmour vocal impersonation to carry the songs along. I heard his shows at the EnCent in 02 were unreal.&nbsp;<br />Pointless trivia - The reason I didn't go see him in 02 was because, poor lowley year 12 student that&nbsp;I was, I could only afford to go to one concert - him or Tool. Tool of course won out.&nbsp;<br />4 years on, I'll be seeing them both on consecutive nights!<br />Good stuff. And to celebrate, I'm going to listen to Waters best solo album - The one that masquaraded as a Pink Floyd album, The Final Cut.<br /><br /><br /><br />"

<p><strong><font size=""3"">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</font></strong> <br />Directed by Python legend Tery Gilliam, and faithfully based on Hunter S. Thompson's classic psychadelic masterpiece, Fear and Loathing... sees Johnny Depp at his method-acting best playing the eccentric Raoul Duke, Thompson's alter-ego in this semi-fictional account of one crazy, drug addled weekend spent in Vegas searching for the American Dream... </p>
<p><em>""We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole multi colored collection of uppers, downers, laughers, screamers... Also, a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls...."" - <strong>Raoul Duke</strong></em> </p>
<p><br /><font size=""3""><strong>Ravenous</strong></font> <br />Impossible to catagorise, this B Grade is part vampire horror, part cannibal survival, part splatterfest, part black humor and all quality. Set in an isolated army station high&nbsp;in the moutains in the 1840's, it follows a disgraced captain, investigating the dissapearance of a band of travellers, rumored to have started eating each other to survive...Scored by the excellent Damon Albarn (of Blur and the Gorillaz fame), Ravenous shows how much can be done on a small budget but with a great script and quality actors (namely Robert Carlyle and Guy Pearce) </p>
<p><em>""I said we had no food... I didn't say there was nothing to eat."" - <strong>Colhoun</strong></em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><br /><strong><font size=""3"">Apocalypse Now</font></strong> <br />A simple review cannot do this film justice. It has to be seen, and experienced, to be believed. If you haven't before, log off your compter and go to the DVD store NOW. Movie's like this are why the medium of film exist. Pretty much perfect. <br />Simple as that. </p>
<p><em>"" I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor. That's my dream. That's my nightmare. Crawling, slithering, along the edge of a straight... razor... and surviving... "" - <strong>Kurtz</strong></em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><br /><strong><font size=""3"">The Big Lebowski</font></strong> <br />The Coen brothers never topped this cult masterpiece. Perhaps one of the most irrevelant movies made, yet utterly engaging, with some of the most quirky, and memorable dialog and characters ever written. Holding the record for the number of times ""fuck"" is spoken in any film, it is worth viewing just for John Goodman's tour de fource as Walter Sobchezk, an unstable war vetern obsessed with bowling and Vietnam. Essiential viewing. </p>
<p>""<em>Nihilists?! Fuck me. I mean, say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos."" -<strong> Walter</strong></em> </p>
<p><br /><strong><font size=""3"">The Wall <br /></font></strong>The cinamatic half of Pink Floyd's classic concept album of the same title, The Wall is the complete realization of Roger Waters dark, bleak svision of a burnt out rockstar on the verge of total breakdown and descent into madness. The blend of visual and sonic imagery is seemless and both surreal and truely stunning and is a required viewing for anyone who has any passion for music. </p>
<p><em>""Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry. Mother's gonna make all of your nightmares come true. Mother's gonna put all of her fears into you. Mother's gonna keep you right here under her wing. She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing..."" - <strong>Mother</strong></em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><br /><strong><font size=""3"">Office Space</font></strong> <br />Mike Judges piercingly accurate satire of modern life, to which anyone who has ever worked in in a large office environment an instantly relate. Its accuracy is remarkable, and almost eerie in parts, and may just inspire legions of cube farm workers to rebel against inept management. A modern day cult classic. </p>
<p><em>""No, not again. I... why does it say paper jam when there is no paper jam? I swear to God, one of these days, I, I'll just kick this piece of shit out the window. "" - <strong>Samir</strong></em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><br /><strong><font size=""3"">Aliens</font></strong> <br />The second installment in the long running Alien saga, Aliens saw the genre of Survival Horror refined and perfected in a style that has often be imitated but never equalled. One of the few sequals that surpasses the original, Aliens is a dark, atmospheric, gritty sci-fi&nbsp;classic that features Sigourney Weaver at her tough-as-nails best. </p>
<p><em>""They're coming outta the walls. They're coming outta the goddamn walls!...""&nbsp; - <strong>Hudson</strong></em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><br /><strong><font size=""3"">Monty Python's Life of Brian</font></strong> <br />The most offensive of the Python movies, but without doubt the funniest. Initially banned in scores of countires upon it's realese, it see's the Pythons in thier best ever form and has earnt itself a massive cult following. Ranked by many critics as the funniest film ever...So much so it caused me to wet myself with laughter on first viewing. Yes, it's that good.</p>
<p><em>""All right, but apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?""&nbsp; - <strong>Reg</strong></em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><br /><strong><font size=""3"">Reservior Dogs <br /></font></strong>Tarantino's first major hit, this movie is virtually flawless. Filled with snappy, witty dialog, tense atmosphere, trademark directing and thick helpings of violence and crime, it set a trend for which Tarantino would follow to this day. A massively influential semenial classic, Reservior Dogs can be credited for starting a whole new genre of modern films. </p>
<p><em>""Listen kid, I'm not gonna bullshit you, all right? I don't give a good fuck what you know, or don't know, but I'm gonna torture you anyway, regardless. Not to get information. It's amusing, to me, to torture a cop. You can say anything you want cause I've heard it all before. All you can do is pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get."" - <strong>Mr Blonde</strong></em> </p>
<p><br /><strong><font size=""3"">Transformers - The Movie</font></strong> <br />Dismissed as a mere childrens film, this movie shaped my younger years. Surprisingly dark and bleak at points, this epic deals with many theme's lost on it's primary target audience - Death, life, hope, war, hate, despair and comradship. With a cheesy 80's soundtrack, corney ""moving""&nbsp;moments, lots of explosions&nbsp;and cutting edge animation, you simply didn't live life as a 8 year old until you saw this... </p>
<p><em>""For a time, I considered sparing your wretched little planet, Cybertron. But now, you shall witness... its DISMEMBERMENT. "" - <strong>Unicron </strong><br /></em></p>

<p>At work eariler today, over lunch, a co-worker was reading the paper. Apparently some manner of article about the new smart cards (And i'll save my rant about THEM for later)...</p>
<p>Anyway, she half looked up and said something to me along the lines of:<br /><em>""Huh, how about that...""</em></p>
<p>Bored, I sighed, put down the sports section crossword and took the bait, asking <em>""Yeah? How about what?""</em></p>
<p><em>""Well, some dude was quoted as saying these cards makes us one step closer to a big brother state...Wow! You know a TV show is popular when its name and concept starts becoming part of the normal vocab!""</em></p>
<p>I paused for a frantic few seconds, desperatley searching for ANY sarcasm or jest in her voice...Disturbingly, there was none...I knw then that this was going to be one of those conversations..</p>
<p><em>""You...Your serious, aren't you?""</em> I asked.</p>
<p><em>""Huh? About what???""</em></p>
<p>Then that dull, throbbing sensation in my head started. You know the one, where you just know that your talking to someone so stupid it's probably killing off your brain cells...&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>""So...You actualy think the term ""Big Brother"", in this context, started with the reality TV show?""<br /><br /></em>She looked at me quite confused and and replied<em> ""Well of course! it's been going for ages! 6 years&nbsp;I think now! Yeah, it started when I was at school! I,ve seen them all!""<br /><br /></em>I still was waiting for her to burst out laughing, admit she was taking the piss. This didn't happen...</p>
<p><em>""...So...does the name ""Orwell"" mean anything to you at all?""</em> I asked feebly. She returned a confused and blank look.</p>
<p><em>""Erm...No, should it?""</em></p>
<p><em>*sigh* ""Not to you, prole""</em></p>
<p>I then decided to leave the room in a hurry so as not to yell at the poor, ignorant&nbsp;girl.&nbsp;<br />Isn't ANYONE educating these people in their youth????</p>"

He bought it, or at least gave the impression he did, and that was that.<br /><br />Feeling rather pleased with myself, I settled back into bed, turned my snooze alarm off, and was about to doze off when suddenly I remembered that yesterday, as me and a few mates were leaving WIN stadium in Wollongong after watching the Dragons trounce the Bronco's, I ran into Vicky and her husband - &nbsp;both Bronco fans...Vicky is the work 2IC.

Dear Sir and/or madam.
FUCKING QUIT IT.
Every fucking time someone at work turns on your shitty pop radio stations all I hear are classic songs butchered, mutilated, raped, stripped of their soul and squeezed out of your cookie-cutter 15 minutes of fame instant-hit trendifying pop factorys.
Classics don't fucking need dance re-mixes. They don't need turntables and beat boxing and rapping on them. They don't need to be set to a trance tehcno beat of 300BPM's. They don't need skanky 30+ whores slutting up trendy MTV filmclips.
They don't need it, we don't want it, it should be crinimal.

Other then that it was fine. Awesome food, I'll give them that. If you're ever down there, make a point to stop off at the BBNT franchise (Burgers, Burritoes, Nachoes and Taco's) or the Lord of the Fries eatery on Flinders Street...Seriously the best fries in the world. No, really. And vegen too (if you choose the right sauces...), for those of you so inclinded. Something for everyone.

Stopped by the M.C.G and had a transcending cosmic feeling of peace, serenity and humbility. Such a moment. Pity I didnt have the camera. You all would have seen me drooling. For some reason. Went to some other touristy places. Felt daggy trying to navigate the tram system. Those whacky Victorians and their light rail.

Caught a few gigs down there, went to a few clubs, caught up with some good freinds and good times were had by most. Most of the time. Yup. Nice trip.

Part2

I'm seriously getting the shits with how all of a sudden Johnny Cash is becoming a fashion pop icon, ala The Ramones. I mean, believe me, it irrated me enough when it became lasts years thing to sport brand new pre-faded and torn Ramones shirts, (retailing for $80 at a Jeans West or whatever), but not being a huge Ramones fan I could pretend it, and the uber-trendy rock-revival bullshit didn't annony me that much...
But when did it become Cash? You cannot walk down the street in the city without seeing at least half a dozen sheep in their black CASH shirts, every one the same picutre of him flipping the bird. Yes, its a cool shirt, but funnily enough, I didnt see that 3 or 4 years ago. I feel like stopping each and every one of them and asking them whats their favourite album? Sure, some would be geniune fans, but I'll bet dollars to donuts that at laest half shurg and mumbled ""Umm...I duno, that prison one??""
And now 'Walk The Line' is only making it worse. Don't get me wrong, more exposure for the great man is awesome, but a lot of its in the wrong way, with the wrong marketing spin, and with the wrong type of impressionable idiots lapping it up. 
Mark said it best - he wants to make a shirt with a photoshoped image of Johnny Cash wearing a Ramones shirt on it...."

""I've read that England has banned all bird imports after finding a dead parrot in quarantine, suspected for having Avian Flu. Are they sure? Perhas they should ask John cleese for a second opinion - It may just be pining for the fjords...""

I piseed myself laughing, very loudly, in the breakroom. A few co-workers strolled over and glanced at what I was still giggling at. They read it once, twice, three times, looked at me puzzled and confused, read it again, shrugged and walked away.
The same morons quote Rove back and forth every Wednesday morning and haw-haw like lame donkeys.

RE : Fuck You.

To whom it may concern.
We (The cricket loving public of Australia) wish to convey to you all just how much we hate you. For years we have asked, begged, pleaded, threatened and wept in regards to your selection process. We have watched with dismay your antiquated methods (i.e Caetain players far beyond their prime and with one foot in the grave and one of a bananna peel...And keeping them on for yet another season). We have watched with dismay as your internal suabbles have robbed the team of their infrastructure (i.e Letting Lillee go as defensive coach over a simple pay dispute). We have watched as your smug complacency and reliance on waning results as justification has robbed our beloved green caps of their sheen. And now we are watching the end of a generation, of an era, of a dynasty. The ashes. The rot has set in, and much like our rugby playing compatriots in the Wallabies there will be no quick fix. Now is the time to rebuild. 
Fuck you all. You have pissed all over one of our proudest sporting traditions. 
Of course, it would be pointless to place ALL the blame on you...

...

Australia cricket team, take a seat. Warney, McGrath, step outside boys. You got nothing to answer for. As for the rest of you...SHAME. Whilst I do believe *some* of you have made an effort to the best of your fading abilites, and have had glimpses of what could have been, the fact is some of you no longer deserve to remain at prime level. Some time in the A's should either straighten you out, or indicate that this decision is justified. You know who you are. Others have let complacency slip into their game. They best iron this out before it becomes far too set in...Hard work is your only option. 
Hayden... Do the honerable thing. Kill yourself. Please. Your 5th test 100 only served to show what you once were and contrast your current dismal form. Goodbye. And last but not least, our pround skipper, who will forever be known for losing the Ashes after 18 glorious years...WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING. One captains knock (in the 3rd) does NOT excuse the confusing, mysterious and downright stupid tactical decisions made by you. Sending the Poms into bat!?!? Take the fading lighgt option when defeat seemed certain? 
Step down. Gilly deserves your job. 

Take a long hard look at yourselves. You've disapointed a whole nation when you had the talent and ability to remain on top. Shame"

"event","<P>The definition of anonying? <BR>Arriving at Aussie Stadium at 3:45 for todays A-Leauge match between Sydney FC and Melbourne Victory (5:00pm kickoff), expecting your friends to arrive as per planned at 4:00 - 4:15, and having them finally show at 5:20... <BR>by which stage, even though the game was well in progress, the lines still meant we probably wouldn't get in 'till half time. We gave up and watched the game ina&nbsp; bar in Fox Studios, with me sulking most of the way through. </P>
<P>In ten years time when the A Leauge rivals the 3 other footy codes, I can tell people ""Yup, I was almost there at the first game!""</P>
<P>Dang. Oh well, managed to catch up brriefly with Bianca (<lj user=""turdstomper"" /> ) which is always cool.</P>
<P>The definition of bliss?<BR>Pizza Hut all your can eat, (Saturday night). Mousse ist Krieg! I shall be returning soon</P>
<P>Otherwise the weekend was uneventful. Most of the time was spent in Newtown with Maddy. After a lot of discussion we've both decided we over-reacted, even though (apparently) I was in the wrong initially (Yeah, I guess i can admit it...)<BR>We marked 5 months together today, by watching the Futrama DVD we watched the first day we spent together. Coincidently it was not delibertly at first, we just jumped on the couch, cooked up some jaffles, poped in a DVD and when we realized the significance watched the whole thing through and reminisced. Sappy, yes, but thats how we are.</P>
<P>The Roosters are a slight chance of making the finals!&nbsp;And the dragons are a fair chance of stealing the minor premiership, or at least hopefully finishing in the top 2 (a top 4 finish is now certain)&nbsp;Oh happy days! </P>"

<P>The weekend just passed prooved amazing satisfying, and&nbsp;I feel oddly content for a sunday night. How stange.</P>
<P>Friday night was a blink run, which was short lived when Danea was booted out at 1.30 for bringing in outside booze, and she stormed home, me and Maddy following suit. Still, the night was very enjoyable, starting at Mad's house (where I dyed her hair and trimmed her fringe), with some light drinks, then progressing through the city, where we ran into a calvacade of people, Bianca and Megan from my school days, Nurk, Bec and Cath (<lj user=""exploded_music"" /> ) returning from NiN, Blacktown Megan and Roman,&nbsp;and Bill and Yasmin. It was one of those nights. Enjoyable, even if I never met up with Conor and Chris at Blink as planned. </P>
<P>Saturday was one HELL of a sleep-in, for no good reason&nbsp;(God I love weekends), then DVD's and pizza 'till the night.&nbsp;Mad and I&nbsp;then trekked down to the Empire at Annadale to catch Celestial play, and&nbsp;I can't remember a better local gig this year. Again, we ran into a score of people, and the atmosphere was just really great. Hung and drank with Tweek, which was&nbsp;a long time coming, caught up briefly with Toddy (<lj user=""apolyom_todd"" /> ) and met his charming g.f. Jess (Who I was surprised to find actually knew who I was), chatted to jody for the first time in a while, saw Tim and Ryan (who hung with us through A.D's set), did a bit of the filming of the gig, and just generally enjoyed the music and the evening. I'd forgotten how much fun it is to hit the local scene. A fucking great night, and an awesome set from Todd on his last night in the band. Good luck mate.&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the way home we stopped for&nbsp;gelatto and stayed up late watching Futurama DVD's. And life was good.</P>
<P>Today, again, a massive sleep-in (Is there&nbsp;a better quality then laziness? I think not!) then I returned to the shire and hit the Bangor Tav to watch the footy with Chris and Conor . All and all a great weekend, in which i got to see and catch up with some great people I don't see as often as I'd like too, and it was all rather cheap as well! Everyone wins! </P>"

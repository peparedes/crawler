"event","I dont really know what sparked this, but i think im going to write a HP book 7 prediction. I warn you though, if you havnt read The Half Blood Prince yet, You may not want ot read this. It may be a spolier, im not sure yet.

Anywyas.

Well obviously ron & hermione were getting into eachother, the whole jealousy thing was amazing in the 7th. I just wanted them to ""snog"" already. So yeah, I think they will have the same relationship tension going on throughout most of the book and then ron will maracurously save hermione from something incredible and deadly. Or, maybe a twist, hermione well save ron, which actually is more probably because of the nature of the characters. At the end of the book i think they will deifnately say something that will lead us to believe they'll get married and so on. 

Then again, it could be completely opposite, and harmione and ron will end up hating eachother. But i also think the only possilbe way they won't end up together is if they originally get together and then somehting happens.

Okay, onto the plot of the story. You know the whole horcrux deal, without them, voldemort is absolutely nothing. I think that harry and the gang will return to school, and then leave without notice somtime during he year after an uprising in some dark side news. They'll go out to try and find and destroy all the horcruxes. Then they will go on some struggling and heroic journey, the typical thing, and then they'll destroy all but one. It will some down to harry and voldemort, face to face, no one else. They'll do that cute battle thing they did in GoF and all the heart-warming dead people surroundding harry situation will occur, andmy deseaced lover will be there, Albus. And YES, i truly beleive he is dead and will not rise again. I beleive that when harry sees dumbledore again, he will realize the he himself is the final horcrux(voldemort rested his power in him back in the day when the scar originated). He'll have to kill himself and voldemort, i know, i tear jerking end. Ron and Hermione will show up right before he kills both himself and voldey.

And so ends the series.

"event","Once upon a time there was a team of field hockey players. All of these girls worked very hard and worked their butts off under King Galvan's rule. They learned all sorts of things like dodging the players yonder, and working with thy stick. And dribbling, they learned lots and lots of dribbling because if they just hit thy ball with thy stick right to opposing players, King Galvan would say ""Off with their heads!"" and they did not want that. This team of mere serfs worked up to the last outdoor game and played wonderfully. Then the season ended. King Galvan sold his team to Lord Jessica Nutting. The girls played at Bridgewater Sports Complex Castle because even though the outdoor season was over, there love of the sport called them to the indoor field. The stupid one on the team ate a donut before she arrived and it was really good and made her very happy until she almost threw it back up onto her awesome goalie girlfriend. The girls ""had no purpose"" and had trouble ""defending the territory"" adn clearly, their feet had not been fixed. Then the team played forgot absolutely everything they learned and worked at and kind of sucked, but they still won and lived happily ever after. The end."

Ohhhh man. there was that lady from Magic..oh how I wished she would just leave, her voice got sooo annoying. I felt the need to push her off the stage. But I got over that.. Haha.

Then Zach S, Steph, Dave, Zach W, and I went to see Cry Wolf. Good movie, recomended but not very highly. whatever.

Thennnn I came home and cleaned my room. It's comming along, I just needa new comforter and then decorate a lil bit. I mean, 2 posters and a johnny are nice but just not good enough.

Then I went over Krista's house with Christina, George and Jimmy (c's cousin) Tws amazing. We watched FEVER PiTCH and THE NOTEBOOK. I cried during both movies, I love those ones to death.

I almost nailed 3 girls in the head, 2 of which probably would have gone into a severe acoma if they hadn't moved. And on top of that, yesterday I killed brynn's ankel (while DRIVING) and today broke Jill's ball. I dont want to hurt anyone, and thats all I seem to do. No more driving. End of story. Oh and I like how I got so many thigns called on me, dont you?


And then, I get back into the locker room just to realize that I left my favorite (new, by the way) skirt in the fricking gym locker room. At this point I was in tears, I dont know why, I guess I was just really upset.

Even today, I thought it was going to be a practice from hell kind of thing, and in a way it was dont get me wrong, but I loved every minute of it. And Christine, Christina, and I were switched to back, and so far I love it. I'm not wicked bad at it so there's a future there.

I killed Brynn today. I'm sorry babe, get out of my way next time =]

Our seats were absoluelty amazing, and I made friends with a 12 year old slut! haha. Against Me was the first band up, the music was good but their siging not so much. Maybe they're just bad live? Yeah and then Jimmy Eat World came on. AMAZING. They are so good and I never really listened to them before the concert, I think I like them. And then Green Day came on. The show was the best thing I have ever seen in my life. I've never been to a real concert before, so this was even awesomer than anything else. OH MY GOD I cried twice. once when they came on the stage, and another when they played Basket Case. That's my favorite song ever and it made my day. No, scratch that. It made my life. haha.

I think not.

It was wicked fun, but it was more work than I think I've ever done for a sport in my whole entire life. We ran so much, but luckily not once did I think I was going to puke(and if I wasn't a freshmen I thinkI might have died. Poor people who had to run a bajillion laps. Im sorry for you). And I was proud of myself, when we ran the mile I ran 2 1/2 out of the 3 laps we needed to do. WOOT for cookie. Then we did so much dribbling I wanted to scream. But thank God I was forward for a year or so before I swithed to back, made things a lot easier. I really wanted to drive too, I had worked my butt off in my yard practicing after that little episode at the captains practice. Yeah so anywayssss during break Emily, Krista, Christina, Jill, and myself all went to Dunkies. I don't think we'll ever do that again. I didn't eat much but I guess I had a lot of sugar so I thought I was going to be sick. Oh well. 

Then I got home, and ran. Im so stupid. I pulled somehting in my leg during practice and running a half a mile extra didnt help. I was planning on running 1 or 2 miles but my knee was going to expliode and whatever I pulled was being mean to my leg. And so ended the mile.

Can't wait to march and do our drill books.

I think my  left leg might die on me. Both of my pathetic injurys are on the leg. lsdhfaslkjdfh. But I'm managing to walk without limping, go me."

Today wasn't too eventful, but I did a lot of things that were somewhat of the physically demanding sort, im wiped.

Woke up around 7:30 or so, for field hockey. Practice was fine up untill driving. Let's not go into that......Thennnnnn Sue picked me up and went back to the condo. We made Pizelles (sp?) for nolan's baseball thingy I hafta go to. I guess it's like a cookout slash parents v.s. kids game thingy. Whatever, either way i have to go. After that I went to help our new pastor move into the parsonage. It took 4 hours to move all the stuff into the house. I thought my arms were going to fall off, but thats okay. I got to be friends with his daughter, Candace, and she seems wicked nice. Amber, his other daughter didnt really talk much. I was kind of dissapointed because she's going to be a freshman too. Oh well i like 8th graders better anyways. His whole family is nice i guess. They're from minnesota which is cool, heck yes. Pastor Dornan isn't all bad, I used to loathe everything about him. I guess Im warming up to him. Yep. After that I went home and practiced driving the damn ball...Then  I got back to here and listened to music for 347239874293874 hours. Then my battery ran out, and so ended Green Day. 

I took a shower. Smelling of soap is a good thing.

I spend way to much timew of the computer. But it's what I do, and It's one of the few things I can do right. Wow all my entries sound like calls for attention, sorry about that, I dont mean it like that at all. Just ventisizing.


field hockey was so embarrasing. Lets not practice driving ever again. ever. kay? kay.

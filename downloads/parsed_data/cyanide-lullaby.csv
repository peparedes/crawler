"event","So...just thought i'd give an update on life. I'm not writing again in here, but i was just kinda checkin up on everyone.

So zack and i broke up...a week before our 3 months. It's okay though...i mean yeah, it blew at first....but i initiated it. I planned on getting back with him...but he proved to me that he wasnt capable of being a boyfriend...and it sucked, but it was the truth...I need a guy who will actually associate with me. 

Which is exactly what i have =). Chris my boo...and i adore him...and fate kinda made us get together, even though neither one of us wanted it in the beginning....its crazy..but i love every fucking second of it =). 

I dont really hang out with anyone these days...I still hang out with ashley because she's my best friend in the world....oh heres one for ya haha, BEN and i are friends =). It's pretyt awesome...that whole awkward thing has passed. The day of our 1 year breaking up ( yeah im a nerd and i remember ), April 20th...He randomly texted me and asked what i was up to, i got onilne and talked to him for about 3 hours, and the next day we went to the movies. And ever since we're just.....cool =). There's nothing else, i <3 chris ( and they actually dont hate each other! ) , but it's nice to know he's around. 

Sara and i dont really speak at all anymore....she's an exotic dancer now? and lives in VA beach? that's what ive heard around, and seen...so eh. She's a cool person, and i loved her so much...but i cant do the exotic dancer thing. i just cant.

I dont talk to brandon anymore either....he's in VA beach too i think.

Zack and i dont really speak...he tried to stalk chris, and that didnt work out...and now we dont talk. eh....

Amber is still psychotically insane, as usual. Ashlea is still my boo. eh the end. 

i dont drink at all anymore. i odnt smoke pot at all anymore. i smoke far too many cigarettes...climbin up to that 2 pk latter again * sigh * 

OH YEAH. So i quit my job lol...eh. fuck it, who needs to fold clottttthes.

Im going to bed....goodnight"

"event","so i'm leaving live journal. simply because there's nothing here for me anymore. 

with each phase of live we have to move on. and for me, i'm moving on from an online journal. simply because these hold memories...and memories keep you from that change needed. 

To anyone i have ever hurt..with any of these words or any others....i'm sorry...from the bottom of my heart. I've changed so much in the past few months....ive grown so much as a person....and i owe a little of that to everyone. 

Ben : if you are reading this, even though you said you wouldnt...i'm sorry. thank you, for the letter, it was the closure i needed to move on with my life and stop living in an impossible dream. it was what i needed to be able to wake up and go to sleep...it made me okay again. i'm sorry for ever hurting you, or annoying you, or making you angry...i never meant to do any of it. you'll always be my best friend. 

I love you guys all so much. i'm sure ill start another journal somewhere, at another random site...until then......

Cool friends shouldnt be let go. and there arent many in existance. 

My mom apparently has been talking to mr woodle on email. isnt THAT a fun thing to hear. And she says next she's emailing my english teacher. i love this game. only im just kidding. bah.

He tells her about every single assignment i have..and shes on my back constantly "" do you know you have a quiz! do you know you have homework! blah blah blah! "" I can't stand it. I can do shit on my own..but when people are on my back i just get irritated and annoyed.

Ben : i dont get you..you say you want completely out of my life, you want nothing to do with me because your girlfriend will get pissed off...Yet you still read my journal, and then get pissed off at what it says? No i havent been perfect..and yes i kick myself everyday for everything...but apologies mean nothing to you. You act like you've done nothing....as if completely shutting me out of your life is nothing at all. Did you expect me to just sit back and say "" eh well ya know, it's cool! we'll be friends when they break up! it doesnt matter! "" . No. You know you meant the world to me, and you were my best friend, and you hurt me, and thats the end of it. I dont get why the fuck you would read this if you hate me so much...You couldnt even accept a God damn book....but you can read my online journal and get pissed and expect me to feel bad about it? journals are for venting. Ive said shit in here that i dont mean and shit that i do mean...it all comes without thinking. I've tried the apologies, ive tried staying away, ive tried being friends, and ive tried being in love with you...and no matter what i ever do, <b>ill never be good enough for you</b>. I really just dont know what you want from me. Last time i asked you that you said you wanted nothing at all....so why are you here. You walked out of my life remember? You wanted nothing to do with me. I dont know what to say to you. I'm not making a fool of myself over this shit anymore.

<hr>
So anyways. Today was a day, a bipolar day lol. School blew and i was tired and it was gay...but Zack picked me up which owned. We pretty much just drove around all afternoon....drove past amber's cause if igured she was out since it was so nice outside, and i wanted to say hi to mome...well she was there so we just kept goin and i gave mome a call and let her know that i wanted to tlak to her or see her or w/e and just to call me if she wanted. So yeah. he took me home at like 5 and then Brandon came and got me and we went to the mall and ig ot Zack's present =D! well i kinda got it lol...ill be getting it pretty much friday. I'm excited, and brandon is definitely the coolest guy ever. . .So yeah...

So then brandon and i are on our way to b&n...and i get a call from amber asking me to not "" ride past her house "" anymore...telling me its "" not necessary "". God. i feel like peoplet hink im in a gang or somethin and im gonna shoot up the house. it was stupid. 

SO we got to b&n and i called ashlea and ended up crying for like an hour...i dont feel like going into details but it was gay. i'm not stupid enough to fuck with people like that..i just wouldnt do it. I just wanted to see mome....but whatever....

SOOOO...then sara came and i said goodbye to everyone and we rode over to Famous Daves for her to get her schedule or somethin like that....So while i was waiting i saw mr breth and was like "" hey you should give me a job!"" kinda half jokin...well he hired me on the spot and i start friday lmao. So i finally have a job that will give me money!! yay!! lol. 

SOOO yeah...Now i'm at home...and i cant decide what mood i'm in..and im waiting for zack to call..and im probably gonna cry agian because im too emotional for my own good...and im on day like 29..and its way too insane. Bah.

As a boyfriend, he didnt work out...we were too alike...we butted heads...we fought constantly and fell apart...but he was an amazing friend, and i miss the kid like crazy. I guess some part of me is still pretending patrick isnt gone....but the goodbye tonight make the last goodbye far too real. there is nothing like that last car ride..and that last time listening to your favorite songs. I wish patrick and i hadnt did the love thing..and we would have just stayed friends...because i'd still have him as a friend. we fucked up when it came to the relationship, but as friends we were amazing. 

"" in the car, the radio leaves me searching for a star...a constelation of frustration driving hard...singing my thoughts back to me like watchin heart ache on TV....but as you sleep and no one is listening, i will lift you off your feet, i'll keep you from sinking....dont you wake up yet, cause soon ill be leaving you.....soon ill be leaving you, but you wont be leaving me... "" 

I think the hardest part...was watching Greg ask for the addresses of all his best friends..and cleaning his room out and reliving all the memories..and talking about how it wasnt the end............and i didnt have that. Patrick even told me...straight out..that no, i should have absolutely no assurance that he would ever speak to me again...he promised to lose contact...and that kills me. The last time i saw patrick, we were standing on my front porch...he promised me he loved me..hep romised me he'd come back for me..and he swore to God it wasnt goodbye. 

I'm not dissapointed that he didnt love me. I'm not dissapointed that im not moving to charleston and starting a life and all that shit we planned. But i am dissapointed that it was goodbye. and a shitty one at that. I dont know...i guess it juts sucks...seeing Greg, and all of those kids...so tight...and seeing them love each other so much, and him promising to write...and patrick promised not to. i dont know....reliving memories just makes me wanna fall over. bah.

dont get me wrong at all, i'm completely happy now. i have the most amazing boyfriend in the world who i'd die for in a heartbeat...i have awesome friends...and hopefully ill have more awesome friends soon if his friends all like me lol...and im just a happy person. the drama is gone, the stress is gone, and its just happy...but eh...im not one to let go of friendship easily.


oh well...whaddya gonna do. hopefully he'll change his mind and write...although i doubt it * sigh *.
<3 britto.

So i think me and Ash are sort of okay? Or we're gonna be sorta okay? I dont really know....Friday night she texted me some song lyrics that made me cry...and i called her and was like wtf....and she explained and i told her i loved her and wanted to talk things over...so we planned to meet up eventually. So then Zack and I went to iChester for awhile...and i kinda felt like shit. I had called the doctor cause somethin with those pills went waaaaaay wrong....and she told me to take 2 advil every 4 hours....which i dont see how that works lol, but ill cut my uterus out if i have to. So anyways, i was feeling like crap..and zack was on the comp...so i layed on the counter and talked to Jar heh. 

So eventually we left and were on the way to my house when Sara called and wanted me to stay the night, and so I did. we went to walmart and i was feeling better..and i got wax =D i missed my wax =D. So we went to Sara's and zack tried to dye his hair again lol, but it didnt work out...And then he left, and it was around 2 or 3..and we went to Aladins...buuuuuuut they weren't serving anymore....So then shaun and sara and lance and i, yeah we almost hit some straight edge kids.....and that was awesome lmao. So then we went back to Shauns house and sara crashed and i was on my way, so he took us all home. 

SOOOOO then yesterday zack picked me up from saras...and we drove around looking for carwashes lmao.and finally i went home and went to work....i hate work. SO YEAH. I decided last night what i think im gonna get zack =D. hehehe. I hope he likes it though =(...Reoch said he'd like a blade of grass if i gave it to him lmao. 

Yeah so then Zack picked me up and we went to the party at Greg's..and it was fun but he didnt want me there cause of greg or something...idk..i didnt really get it...so we left...and i cried for stupid reasons..and then we ended up in the driveway with me apologizing and crying and him telling me i was cute lol. Events of the night reminded me of douchebag Ben...and i ended up getting super paranoid and upset and it was gay...I begged him not to lie to me or cheat on me...and was crying...And he took my hands and put them around his throat and said "" if you think i'd ever cheat on you, choke me right now ""...and i kinda melted lol. 

SOoo i went inside and sat online for endless hours...and he called me and was on speakerphone at the party and was completely wasted..and asked me to marry him lmao. And then i think he fell or something? i dont know..so darcie got on the phone and said they had made him stop drinking so he was okay lol, and i thanked her..and then she was hanging up and i heard him screaming "" I LOOOOVE YOU "" lmao...and i laughed.

So then he got online...and asked me to marry him again lmao...and told me he wouldnt care if my boobs decayed..and told me he loved me i think 500 times? hahaha. it was cute =). I love that boy.

BUt yessum. Now i feel like crap...and i have to work and that's gay.

"event","i'm so fucking sick of people. God guys, did you know im a slut? I love how a guy's chest can be magically converted to a fucking dick.

For anyone that has heard Amber's bullshit, no sir, i did not grab Shaun's dick in any picture. There is a picture where my hand is placed above his belly button. ZACK saw the picture, and wasnt mad. Obviously, if i was grabbing shaun's dick, Zack would have been mad. And as for you Amber, you seriously need to shut the fuck up. I'm not dealing with your bullshit. 

SO anyways. Zack owns me :). heh. Last night we went over to Greg's and there was fire lol, and country music * bleh face *..but all in all it was an awesome night. I met a bunch of his close friends which was really cool, and they were all awesome. And i saw a guy i used to hang out with in middle school that i havent seen since 8th grade lol, that was awesome. SO YEAH.

Today was shitty. I felt like crap. bah. I didnt talk all day in tech though which was actually kinda cool. Ricky brought up a good point, why should we talk?Bah. some days there just isnt anything worth saying. Psh, it was probably good that i couldnt talk...or i might have said shit i shouldnt have said. Let's just say a 5 hour day with the bitch is more than i can take. 

WHICH brings me to my next topic of discussion. LIT MAG * falls over *. Mooney and I finally picked out a body font last meeting which made me happy. I was thinking of quitting...because the thought of spending any time with amber makes me want to stab myself in the eye...but after sitting on that computer..and putting it all together, hell no. She's a crazy bitch, but im not giving up something i love for her. But there's no way in hell im being civil anymore, regardless of which maturity level that brings me to. Last time we werent speaking, i was upset..and begging for forgiveness..and was still in the mindframe that amber=god. But the minute you call me a slut its fucking over. I have extreme issues with that word, and with people saying it about me. I could say a lot of shit, but out of pure respect for mankind, i wont. Hmm, maybe im not a spineless bitch after all! * gasp * 

jesus christ. for almost 4 years i lived my life for that bitch. for her and ashlea and that whole group...living by their rules and kissing their asses and doing whatever they said to do. When the first fight with amber happened, Ashlea pretty much guided me through it...she told me waht to say what to do how to act...and i listened...They have had me on a leash since the day they fucking met me. Well this time, i dont need them anymore. This time, i'm not on their leash. And this time im not going to act how they want me to act. I dont give a shit if they think im "" immature ""...Their lives are bullshit and THEY are immature..with their fuckin drama bullshit. i cant have one conversation without someone bitching about what im doing or what shaun's doing or what we're doing "" together "" ( since duh i touch his penis all the time ). Bah. Whatever.

What can i say, i should just be in the porn industry! damn slut!"

"event","hahahahaha. A slut....twice in one weekend. I should get a trophy. * shows cleavage *

So....here's what i've learned in life. I feel like i should type it out...i might forget next time i get pissed off * wink * 

No matter what happens in life, not everyone is going to like you. Girls are backstabbing bitches that are going to turn on you. You're going to fall in love more than once, and more than likely, one of the times will half kill you. It's not the end of this road that matters...it's how you drive. Tomorrow i may be a slut, but today i'm having fun. That's what matters. Friends are going to come and go, and you're sure to have 1 or 2 that will never let you down. The minute you find those friends, hold on like there's no tomorrow...you will need them. Be influenced in positive ways...but never lose site of who you really are. No 2 people on earth are alike, and not everyone is going to love you...accept it and move on. Let the rumours go...the people who matter won't care. Drama is bullshit and is for losers that dont have a life.....Drama is for girls that can't talk about any other experiences in life..they just have to talk about who fucked who. Life can mean so much more when you're sitting in english class discussing existentialism....than when you're dropping off printed out pictures with Slut remarks printed on them. Care about who matters, fuck who doesnt, and be ready to let go at any moment. Because there's no way to move on if you're not. LIFE IS CHANGE....accept yourself and move on..dont waste away years trying to be what someone else wants you to be. Because there are enough people in this world, that someone out there will...i promise....accept you for what you truely are.

"event","GAH. i hate a fucking cop.

So today was a day to remember/forget. Zack and I both woke up around 11 and he got me at like 1...and we went to b&n to meet up with matt clarke, which was awesome cause i havent seen that kid in fuckin forever. I thought he died...or dropped off the face of the earth....but he's still alive and odd as ever lol. I love him though. 

So then we left and i went and drove for like 5 mintues and got scared lol, so we left, and then ashlea called so we came BACK and met her at b&n..and it was cool to see her. We fight like hell, and things are tense right now..but i do love her, and always will. Zack was ilke "" arent you guys on bad terms? "" and i just kinda had to think about it....and ashlea is the one person who neverh as let me down. She's the only person who'd crawl under a stall for me at b&n.and only she'd get that lol....i love you ash....

So yeah, we saw her and Josh, and it was happiness...and i was all teary eyed when josh came cause i missed him like craziness. ANd so then we left and went to get my check and went to cash it ( a whole 41 bucks! ) 

SOO then we went to Great Oaks to drive around again, cause i suck at manual. So here's where the bacon comes in. I dont feel like typing again, so i'm just gonna paste my convo with laura : 

fate lovesmurder: I was driving zack's truck in amber's old neighborhood cause i know the neighborhood pretty well and i was sick of parking lots...well i started sucking again and got really upset and flipped lol, so he told me to pull over somewhere, so i took him to yonder. So we sat there, and i just planned on calming down and then we were gonna go again. Okay, ive been on my period for 14 days at this point lol, so i wasnt gonna have sex. and he didnt wanna anyways. We were just sittin there. well, i ended up sitting in his lap, just because i was...we werent doing anything but kissing. nothing. swear to god. So apparently some assfuck called the cops, and all of a sudden my back is greeted by 2 flashlights. So one gets zack out and the other gets me out, and one is asking zack whats goin on..and the other asks me. and i was like "" nothing officer..we were driving around and had no where to go so we pulled over. that was it "" and he was like "" how old are you "" and i was like "" 17 sir "" and he was like "" does your mother know where you are? "" I was ilke "" yes sir, well she knows im with him, she doesnt know the exact place "" and he was like "" yeah does she know you're sitting on top of a boy in a deserted cul de sac? "" and my face turned so red and i wasl ike "" no sir she doesnt "" and im trying desperately not to cry
fate lovesmurder: so we go over to the cop car and one of the cops is taking down both of our info..and the other one is harassing us, and was like "" so whats going on with you two "" and zack was like "" she was trying to learn to drive manual, and she freaked out so we decided to pull over so she could calm down and just catch her breath...and we just didnt drive again "" and the cop was like "" is that true "" and i was like "" yes sir "" and he was like "" ye ah....you didnt catch your breath because you were scared or because his tongue was in your mouth? "" 
fate lovesmurder: and i was shaking and half crying...and he was like "" well how did she do "" and zack started laughing and was like "" she stalled out a few times "" and the cop was like "" yeah well maybe she'd drive better if she wasnt straddling you "".
fate lovesmurder: i was so fucking pissed off. it was so gay
eveningsongblue1: oh my god
fate lovesmurder: and apparently when the cop was getting me out and asking me what we were doing, the other one was talking to zack and was like "" so what are you kids doing out here "" and zack was like "" we were just sitting here officer "" and he was ilke "" yeah and im sure you had more intentions "" and zack was like "" im sure my intentions werent what you think they are "" and he was like "" yeah, you and a young girl alone in a car on a friday night. im sure i know what's going on here "" 
fate lovesmurder: it sucked so bad.
eveningsongblue1: did anything happen? like did they go away?
fate lovesmurder: like, he embarassed me so bad..fucking with his stupid comments. nah, they just got our info, called in to see if i was a runaway, and told us to leave. He was ilke "" next time find a more deserted parking lot. you're free to go ""

yeah. i fucking hate a cop. 


BAH. So anyways, after i was a slut, we went to iChester, and talked to jar who owns the land. . .and that was about it. And now i'm at home. and i'm hungry.


good day to you all <3."

The one thing patrick ever told me..that actually stuck with me and wasn't a load of shit..was that there is no meaning in life without change. 

lately life has been a lot different. The only people i still talk to are Ashley and Sarah...and occasionally Laura...the rest of my social life has completely switched over. I love Sara to death..she's by far one of the coolest chicks i have ever met in my life....and Zack treats me better than any guy in the world...and i adore him...And i love everyone else so much...but i dont know. life is just weird. 

I mean...i remember days when i didnt need guys because ashlea and amber were my life and my support...and i didnt need money because i lived at barnes and noble...and i didnt need to be busy all the time..i could get in my car and drive off and not come home for hours...and would just find a random parking lot to play guitar in. I remember living at church, being there every single night for choir or for acteens or for kidfuge planning or for youth....and loving every minute of it. I didnt have friends outside of church...the only people that mattered were ben and ashlea...The only things that mattered were them, God, and music...

I remember being so fucking sure that God existed and God loved me..and there was nothing that could bring me down. I didnt need anything else that i surround myself with...because it wouldnt please him..and i was ONLY here to please him.

i remember having good grades in school because i wanted to go to savannah so fucking bad. because i had so many dreams that i knew were going to come true, because god believed in me..and ash believed in me..and amber believed in me..and ben believed in me....

And then ben broke up with me. and then i smoked pot. and then i dated patrick. and then amber hated me. and then i kept smoking pot. and then i skipped out on church. and then i forgot what friends were. and then i forgot how to trust. and then i learned how to write everyone off. and then i turned apathetic. and now i just dont give a fuck.

now i skip school..now i'm failing...now i dont take pictures...now i dont write poetry...now i smoke pot...now i smoke too many cigarettes..now i lie to my parents...now i skip church..now i dont show up for work...now i dont have a car...now i get told by people that were my best friends that ive changed...that the drugs have fried my brain...that i dont care anymore....

i used to be told that the only good thing about me was my heart. was the fact that i couldnt stop caring.

i trained myself not to care. 
ive turned into ben. ive turned into patrick. ive turned into amber.
ive turned into every single person ive ever hated. 
ive turned into every single person that's ever hurt me.
and i've completely fucked myself over."

"event",""" im not wasting anymore, im not writing songs for you, i sleep better in the dark...i'm not doing this for you. "" 

I freaking love FATA..and i miss this CD. I miss driving in my car this summer, with the windows down and the sunroof open, and this CD blaring as loud as it could possibly go...and whoever was in the car just had to deal. You hear a song like this and you can smell every smell and feel every air molecule that hit you once....I miss it so much. i miss the late nights at barnes and noble..i miss the trips to jon's apartment before he even met beth. i miss getting kicked out of taco bell with ash and amby....i miss sleeping at amby's every night, ashin in the road cone. 

"" steady pilot cause i'm half afraid...i can't believe you'd ask me that, of course i don't believe in fate...So would you be depressed if i attend that wedding? But only as a guest...Such an unfaithful bride, draped and dressed in threads of my regret.. ""

I miss the nights, leaving ambers house at 2 in the morning to take home jon, and riding around the neighborhood at 90 miles an hour, having no clue where i was going...no clue where i was...no clue how i was going to avoid the tree in front of my car. 

<b>"" So arch your back...and flip your hair...make eye contact...so you know i care. ""</b>

I miss hearing that part of the song and having chills radiating down my spine. I miss finding random parking lots to sit on top of my car in and play the guitar as loud as i possibly could. 

I miss getting lost on purpose...ending up in the ghetto and praying to God i didnt get shot. I miss going to Henrico with Amber and Ash, listening to the questions game...

"" but it's always too late when you've got nothin so you say..you should never let the sun set on tomorrow before the sun rises today..If i am another waste of everything you've dreamed of, i will let you down. If i am only here to watch you as you suffer..i will let you down. "" 

I miss hearing this song with ashlea in the front seat and amber sitting beside her...and the hair on my neck stood up...and i cried. And ashlea printed a picture of me and pasted the lyrics on the back...and it's my most cherished gift. 

i miss <s>knowing</s> <i>thinking</i> i meant something...

I miss driving past Kroger, high as a mother fuckin kite...with David starling pretending he was a Bird...running in the store and looking at Ben, shooting me death glares because i came in his store stoned off my ass....but i was too high to give a shit.

I miss the feeling of alchohol poisoning. 

I miss the feeling of best friends takin bowl hits together and eating maccaroni til the sun came up.

I miss falling asleep on the couch of your best friend, watching 4 hours of Recess in a row...

I miss poptarts in the summer, and the cheerio soup in my floorboard..and the rules of the car. 

I miss knowing there was a God..and caring about him...

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
and now there's a day. when i dont know ashlea's name. when i can push the words "" i hope she dies "" off of my tongue. 

ben is no longer employed at Kroger...instead at Target...i go, but he's not mad at me because i'm high. he's mad because i'm brittany.

my car blew up. i havent watched recess in months. i forgot God existed.

im worried about dropping out of school because im too stupid to try...i dont play guitar anymore, i smoke too many cigarettes for that. 

i havent listened to real music in weeks...nothing really matters anymore. 

I have amazing friends...Sara..Reoch..Zack <3..lance..everyone at ichester...
I'll never regret meeting all of these people...i'll never regret life.

but nostalgia has gotten the best of me tonight. 

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Zack treats me so well...he's incredible. Im not used to not being yelled at for breathing the wrong way. Annnd he just told me he's considering getting his lip pierced =o! 


this calls for britto actually participating in this phone converstaion :-D."

"event","<P>Alright kids,</P>
<P>So this is how this story goes. </P>
<P>do you have your pencils ready?</P>
<P>this is the test of <B>life vs. happiness</B>. the solution to your problems lies at the end of chapter . fill in the dots as your mind best suits. but remember you chewed off the erasers in a nicotine fiend fit. </P>
<P><B>number 1</B>. how many times has your heart been ripped off of your sleeve and shoved into a gutter? chapter 1 says you're giving it away. paint the sky red and pay them all back. revenge can taste salty with a side of spice, but only if you let it. 2 step your little heart away, but be sure your toes land right in the middle of that little box of organs you've stashed away.</P>
<P><B>Chapter 2</B>. can you count the number fuck yous you've heard in your past week? how many repeats come from chapter 1? this is where you grab the knife and give them what they need. Wash that vulgar mouth out with your own pure blood bath. Ingredients come in chapter 4. </P>
<P><B>Chapter 3</B>. tears? there's no room anymore. there are enough oceans in this world to drown yourself in, we dont need anymore. This is where you grab the scalpel. An hour or so will do. </P>
<P><B>Chapter 4</B>. full proof blood bath. 1 tbsp of fuck yous and a cup full of "" love "". You can add in lies for spice, and fucking chop and dice. </P>
<P><B>Chapter 5</B>. how many picture frames line your walls? and how many lives do you see when you stare into the glass. 3 2 1 or 0? answer 3 and you're throwing a party. answer 2 and you're living in memories. answer 1 and you're simply alone. answer 0 and your solution is far closer than you know.</P>
<P><B>Chapter 6</B>. Alright start guessing. you're lying on the floor and theres a gun in your hand. How did it get there? Did you find it? Did you imagine it? Did the moon fucking throw it up? Come on you're smart. Feel the barrel. Is it cold? is it hot? is it black? black enough? </P>
<P><B>Chapter 7</B>. Alright let's play the memory game. Yeah that's right you can tap your chin. Your eyes can look to the corner if you please. 1 he said he loved you. 2 he handed you the words. and 3 he chopped them up. Now someone came with a sewing machine and tried to stitch it all back together...but now we're thinking too hard again. What do we do when we think?</P>
<P><B>Chapter 8</B>. You've filled in the bubbles. Only half way i'm sure. Now there are 2 solutions i'm sure you're guessing at here. We can smile and continue through fields and fuckin prairies, or we can do something about this. We've played revenge, we've played self loathing, and we've even tried regrets. Now please count your letters and we'll see which solution we get.</P>
<P><B>Too many A's</B> and i swear to god you're pitiful. you'll be left alone till you die, when you're 90 alone with a kitten. </P>
<P><B>Too many B's</B> and i'm sorry you're wrong, denial isnt the way to go these days. But go eat your chocolate and we'll see where you end up in a week or 2. </P>
<P><B>Too many C's</B> and it's time for fucking therapy. Your an apathetic piece of shit and i swear to god your lying.</P>
<P>but i thought you'd end up right here with me, <B>too many fucking D's</B>. Onto chapter 9 please.</P>
<P><B>Chapter 9</B>. This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Drum roll please, keep your seat on the floor. </P>
<P>Intruction pamphlet is ready dear, look to page 2 for more.</P>
<P>You've been fucked over, you've been spit on, and you kept coming back for more. So please take the gun, put the barrel to your eyes, greatest advice.</P>
<P><B>Suicide</B>. </P>"

i hope nothing can stop us. i hope i can be strong. i hope i can stay in this spiral of denial..this is the first time ive crashed..but i have to stand back up. i cant lose him now. i can't do it...

Ben isnt allowed to talk to me...we saw each other at b&n and i asked him about a rumour i heard...about the true reason he broke things off. he denied it...and i guess i believe him.

School starts tomorrow and that makes me feel like death...I go to the tech center tomorrow. Im gonna be with amby beth and nissa though, so that should be good.

my dad is currently replacing the cd player in my car. FINALLY........REAL MUSIC. lol. im so excited <3. 

Sean came down this weekend, which was pretty splendid. He came friday to b&n, but i felt kinda bad cos i was being shitty all night. Nikki was there, and nikki makes me wanna shove a pencil through my eye. She's so god damn fake. She's one big fucking joke, and i think it's hilarious that she said what she did about me. Oh yeah, she sent me an email wiht all the reasons she hates me lmao. It honestly did make me laugh, but i wasnt in the mood to see her the other night.

Sean told me some stuff about how he feels about me that night and i was just kinda speechless i guess..i mean what do you say to that? I just didnt know what to do. I dont wanna hurt his feelings, but i just dont feel that way about him. He's a great guy, a great friend, i just dont see him that way.

Ive never felt so content. I found out tonight that Ben has a new girlfriend, and i dont think i could care less. She has big boobs and i know that's all he cares about, and it makes me hate him more and more every day.

Ian is an incredible person..he's not shallow and he's not superficial and he doesnt hate and try to change everything about me. He makes me see life in a much better way...ben just made me wanna shove random objects through my eyes.

We sat there for about a half an hour...and that was the end of that game lol. So then...God i cant remember lol. I think i went driving, and eventually came home and watched secret window. It was alright, not as good as people made it out to be. So then i called ash and went over there, but everyone was bitchy so as i was walking out, i get a "" we need to talk ""...and had to go in amber's room. 

Last night we got uber drunk at the house and Ben called me...before the drunkeness, there was the show which ben played...where the allyson girl was. He liked her after we broke up, so she's my lindsey number 2. For some reason i just had a feeling she'd be there, i never even thought about it before that...So i show up, and say "" is allyson here? "" and sure a fuckin nuff, she was. So that put a damper on my evening. Got home, drank lots and lots and lots of alchohol, and then....HAPPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOUUU FUCK YOUUU. Lol, ben called.....I talked to him for like an hour, he was also drunk...it was nice though, he never just calls to talk anymore. So afterwards, i flipped shit, which im good at doing,a nd ended up locking myself in the bathroom for 2 hours. Well back to ashlea and amber...they decided to come at me with "" that cant keep happening "" and bloooob bloooob blooooob....well i totally understand that, but when im confronted like that i run away...it's just the way i handle things. So i walked out of the house and drove off. So then ash calls me about 100 times in the next 20 minutes, asking where i am...finally i met her at walmart..and we discussed it...and i told her i just wouldnt come back tothe house.Basically, it was hell in the walmart dot for about an hour..screaming and crying and woooooohoooooo! So then, WOOT ben called. lol. He came up there, and i left with him. Went back to b&n and sat there for like 10 minutes while he looked at magazines..then his friends came up there and i just kinda left....it was fun....somehow. SOOOO then i went back to amber's for like 30 minutes to "" talk "" which didnt happen, we ended up discussing how different animals have sex....and now here i sit. Lonesome, pissed off, and gooey. 

I fucking hate today. It should die."

"event","* sigh *. okay wait no let's try that again. * shoots self *. there much more like it.

Tonight went from shit to awesome to shit to awesome..lol. All in one night. how that works? I'll never know. I guess God really does hate me, it's not just paranoia.

I left my house because everyone here sucks..and i went to sheetz to get gas..who do i see as im turning in? BEEEEEEEN! WOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! So i decided suicide was a better plan, and turned around very fast and sped away...Went and picked up amber and we went back to sheetz to try again. Who do i fucking see when im turning in? BEN! GOD DAMN! lol. So i went to get gas, he pulled in and came and talked to me...said he was getting off at 9 and would call me...so i couldnt decide if i wanted to die or dance, so we just left. Went to walmart to hunt down 18 year olds, found one, and migrated to wawa. We got our candy and us and ryan all ventured to the beloved Barnes and Noble. We waited for awhile and then the regulars started showing up..lol. Brooks and Adrien came, and then WOOOOO HOOO boy and girl showed up. So i decided i wanted a sweet tart ball, so we went sweet tart ball shopping at the mall. As we were shopping, mome called and said amber had to come home for "" family night "" lol. So i took her home and on the way Ben called...WOOOOOO HOOOOOO! . And we went to brusters...WOOOOOOO HOOOO. lol. We sat and talked for a bit about his job...and i couldnt stop smiling....only i felt like suicide. So we left and he went somewhere and i returned to barnes and noble like the cool kid i am. Tren and Ryan and Shaun and Brooks were there....so we sat outside of Shaun's car listening to the postal service and staring at the sky with binoculars while tren danced...that was the amazing part lol. Tren makes me smile when he's not stupid. So we had one of those few moments that make the rest worth living through...and then i had to go home. So i came home and on the way i get a text from ben "" get on ""...WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOO. So i got on, and he sent me lyrics ( gorgeous of course becauseh he's god ). And I got stupid and asked him if we'd ever happen again...God i just need some sort of closure or hope..anything. I hate sitting and wondering with new blood pouring every night. Alchohol isnt cutting it anymore. Well he got upset and said that he couldnt answer it, that i already knew the answer and was just putting him on the spot, and told me not to bring it up again......so i said okay. And now he's barely talking....Score 1 for britto, the master at making things awkward and talking too much. So i wrote a page long poetic rant that makes sense to no one but me and sent it to him...and he said he likes my style, only not when im morbid lol, and i giggled because i like my morbid-ness...and ash siad im amazing and i told her it's an understatement. And now i'm wondering what i'm gonna do tomorrow....because my life for a week is now over lol. 

Shoot me will you? <3."

"event","' tonight is the rest of our lives....a carbon monoxide lullaby '....i adore the bled.

So...today fucking sucks. Got up at like 11:30...Everyone at the house was sleeping...got on and talked to Josh. Luckily he talked to his dad and his dad is supposed to call me sometime today about getting a job there. But yeah...So I came home..and found out that i'm gonna be at fucking missionfuge when the Atreyu show is happening. Which, adam is saying they arent even playing...so i dont know hwat's going on. Either way, im fucking depressed. I was sooo excited. 

This whole week has sorta blown....i started to like this guy, yeah because im dumb and good at that of course. I dont want to start anything with anyone, since ben....nothing seems worth the pain. But this guy just makes me smile....and he's goofy as hell...and writes the most incredible poetry in the world...and i must say he's gorgeous lol...he listens to amazing music..and just has an amazing personality. He doesnt know the things that are wrong with me....but if he found out he wouldnt care...he knows what it's like to fall apart....something ben never could comfort me with. He thought i was a psycho for those things...and now he just doesnt care. Eh. Not as if it needs caring for...just a simple statement.

But yeah, so this guy...i ended up spending every night with him, among many other people..and it was so much fun...Yesterday we went to see him and he wasnt at his apartment...so we came home...later amber called me in the living room, and who's there? him...with some chick..* rolls eyes * And she's cute lol. Oh well. 

"" So i'm taking a stand with apple in hand. I pull up my sleeve, it's time that i make like an apple tree and leave. "" 

Oh how i adore Ozma. * sigh * Yesterday we went to ass egypt and wasted over a quarter tank of my gas. My mom is gonna be so pissed. No one told me we were going to fuckin everyone and sally's mom's house..we were supposed to be goin to ash's house and then back. So now i have no gas at all. SUCK. My mom's not gonna give me anymore money. God I hope I get this job. Though i wont be ablet o start because of fucking CAMP. God i dont wanna go. I don't give a shit about jesus or God or anything anymore. What the hell do i owe him? Fuck that.

Again i ask..who was in the bathroom with me cleaning me up? God or my best friend.

"event","Gah...I love Atreyu...But not as much as I love My Chemical Romance. They own me...only not their new stuff. It made me cry. I don't know...i need to get money and go buy the new cd...to give it a chance...but as of right now...from the 3 songs i've heard...i want to chop off my ears. I havent read lyrics yet so i dont know how those compare...but eh.

Josh is pissing me off...all "" you dont deserve to be their fan...you cant go see them you dont like the new shit..blahblah...blahblahblah.....blah ""...Man fuck that. I fucking hate people who don't understand the difference between liking something and something being good. Sure, it's probably excellent...because MCR just cant put out anything bad. But that doesn't mean i have to like it..and i can like their old shit without liking their new shit..and they can be my favorite band without me liking everything they've done. jesus christ. i'm so sick of people liking music for the band and not for the music..you're supposed to like a band or a song or a type of music for the way it makes you feel...for the words and the story they tell...for the emotions within it...not because listening to that band will make you more hardcore. A person who is too afraid to say what bands they like...and afraid to not like a band because of how hardcore they are is a fucking poser. And i dont give a shit who you are..you're a fucking poser. Because music is the one thing that isnt about anyone but you. I'll go out and listen to linkin park..then go put in cradle of filth...and then have my guilty pleasure spill canvas moment...and i dont give a fuck what anyone says because im gonna listen to what i wanna listen to. People who listen to bands for other people make me sad...i really feel sorry for them....because they're missing out on the whole point of music..the whole reasoning behind it...just to be cool. And it makes me sad.

* sigh * so now that THAT rant is over.

Me and the Ambyness went and played a lot today..we went to micky D's..and we swatted at flies. And then ash came and we went to the house, then we went to the mall to play with ryan..and we saw james hehehehehehhehee. And then we went to barnes and noble...and then we came home. It was good times. I kinda wanna go to sleep...only im not tired because i slept till 3 today. 

Tomorrow is bandfest. Who's not goin! * raises hand all high *. Hehehe. And then saturday is the jesus car wash...watch me jump for joy...................oh wait im not doing that. I have camp in like 2 weeks lol. I'm gonna cry.

MONDAY NIGHT IS TREEPHORT! i'm excited. July 7th!!!!! ATREYU AND EVERYTIME I DIE. Who's gonna orgasm? MEEEE.

Some girl i dont even know told me i was bi tonight lmao. interesting.

Last night was depressing. Just depressing * falls over *. I went out to lunch with Jonathan, and he picked on my car the whole entire time lol. So i took him home and went over to John's..and me and sarah went with John's family to graduation...and i cried like a baby lol. We wooed for everyone we knew, and when it was over, we all went outside and i saw Chris Snively :(...He told me how much he was gonna miss me and my gorgeous boobs lol...and then he started crying...and i started crying..and it was this big gooey fest =(. So then me and eric and sarah and uncle willy and sean and nikki and some other kids i dont know all went out to bottoms up pizza..and me and uncle willy got married :). And we danced lol, and then we went to karins..for like 2 seconds haha..And then i finally came home. I went to bed as soon as i got in...after eating chocolate of course =).

So this mornin i woke up at like 2 lol..and it was beautiful...showered..and now i'm waiting for John to make up his mind as to where he wants to go. I thought it was just gonna be me and him, but he decided to ask sarah to come. Dont get me wrong, i adore sarah...but i hate hanging out with any couples alone. I mean..that's just an awkward position...a couple and a friend, it never turns out well. So im about to tell them to just go by theirselves. Jesus christ. Everything has to be like this big job when i try to hang out with him. But im still gonna miss him =( 

Well im gonna go dive in the war. * sigh * ill probably just end up going back to bed. that seems like the logical thing to do right now.

"event","Tonight is graduation. I'm not graduating no, just watching old friends. They don't speak to me anymore, but for some reason i feel the need to watch them leave.

Tonight is the end...tonight says that this part of my life is completely over. There is no turning back...tonight is it. 

That one will graduate without ever dating me...that one will graduate without ever telling me the truth...that one will graduate never saying sorry for everything he did...And I'm going to watch it all happen.

And 2 that mean the most arent even walking. I won't get to see them walk away. Maybe it's better that way...

So I'll get dressed in girl clothes..drive over to the ex boyfriend's house..to attend graduation with the present girlfriend....and spend the evening with his family and her. I love her...but i can't ignore the fact that i once loved him. But i'm forced to. So watch me as I do.

Before hand, i'm going to take things to josh...that will be fun. Probably the only good part of the day. I'll then go to kroger and pretend to buy gatorade, while instead searching for Ben and hoping i wont discover he's not really working and he lied. I'll either see him, walk to him subtly, pretend that i didnt make that special trip for him, and leave after saying hello....or i wont see him at all, and i'll leave just as sad as i would had i seen him. No matter how this all works out, it's going to beat me inside.

And usually, i would jump in my car, turn the screaming as loud as it would go...and speed off carelessly, praying for a collision. But...tragedy would say that my stereo is busted. For anyone else this would be a slight inconvenience, a minor set back in the day...for me, it's a reason to not wake up.

Last night I finally told him that it has to end..that i can't take this sorry excuse for a friendship anymore. I lie under his feet like a door mat, leading to her anymore. It's been accepted by everyone that they will always be them...and no one else will ever step into that...but he should stop trying to pull me in. And i'm sick of being told so many things...and blamed for so many mishappenings...that i just cant take it anymore. So we're no more. I love her too much for that.

I think i'm slowly spilling into the canvas....way to be emo britt =). I despised the spill canvas...but slowly im falling for him...* sigh *. Way to be dumb.

Love is for liars. <3."

"event","so..its 1 in the morning and i'd love to sleep..or my eyes would rather..but instead i sit in front of this screen..in the dark..contemplating how exactly my night will go.

will i get off after i post this entry, go lay in my bed, watch the disney channel and slowly drift to sleep?

or will i sit here for a few more hours, arguing with josh about his logic on life, listening to songs reminding me of ben and why exactly i titled this entry ' i cherish you ', and somehow end up in bed at 5 in the morning with the candles lit, confused as to how i'm where i am and doing what i'm doing.

it's all in this deciding moment...what exactly ill feel like in the morning..what ill wear for the next week. * sigh *. Too much pressure. 

People worry too god damn much about others..as if i should talk..but no really. If you dont like someone...just dont pay attention to them! Why is that so hard? I dont understand. I just dont.

I swear to god...i dont understand how some people can be so fucking selfish. "" har har har...i like you so much...har har har. OH wait my other vagina is back. Nevermind i lied. ""

* stares *.

Okay so no one got that but me, but that's okay i'm better off that way lol.

Well, although i havent decided what sort of night this will be, i think im going to go cake hunting.

So I gave up on my old journal site, due to nosey parents who should be ran over by school busses.

I used to have a live journal...only it sucked. So i made a new one, and maybe i'll have a better experience.

But chances are within 4 days i'll forget I even made this, and i'll spend my time wishing i had the energy to make a new journal at any given site.

I have real goals.

Well i'm gonna go...what are you supposed to put in first entries? I never have figured out out, and i've been at journal sites since '97. Woo for being a nerd.

"event","Ok, ok...this is bad.  I know, this is the longest I've ever gone without updating.  Would it help if I said I was sorry?  *said in meek, timid voice*

I'm going to give everyone the quick update of Kristie's life since the time I last updated...and I'm doing it in bullet format!!
Here we go:

- I did get my driver's license!  I got marked down a total of 6 points, one of them was for missing a limit line when making a left-turn, and the other five were for speeding mistakes!  No no, it turns out I was actually going too SLOW in some areas, not too fast.

- Christmas was quite fun.  Very fun indeed!  I spent the entire break with my family, which was nice because I got to relax somewhat.  Mainly for Christmas I just got money towards my car that I will hopefully be buying in June (who knows, maybe May.)  But I also got a DVD player in my room so now when I rent my Johnny Depp DVDs I can watch the parts where he takes his clothes off over and over again!  Very good stuff!

- My birthday was awesome.  Again, spent with the family.  My sister, bless her heart, picked out a huge, framed, very realistic sketch of Johnny Depp for me to hang in my room.  It hangs across from my bed so when I wake up every morning, it's the first thing I see!  It even has my name on it :D  My dad did this cool game show thing where he put on this gag game show in honor of my b-day and I got to go up and play and win my Celine Dion concert tickets.  Did I already mention in a previous post that I was going to get concert tickets for Celine's A New Day, in Vegas?  Well I got them for my birthday.  The concert is during Spring Break, and I have great seats!  It's gonna be sweetness!

- I have finals coming up and I'm not prepared! AHHHHHHHHH

- I made a new years resolution.  hmmm...should I tell what it is?  hmmm...I don't know...ok.  I've been keeping track of how many orgasms I've had this year starting from January 1st.  So far the count is 11, and my goal for the entire year is 300.  I actually think it'll be pretty easy, considering there are 365 days in a year.  hmmm...maybe I should raise it to like 320 or something...?  

- I'm back in karate now that marching season is over.  I missed it so much!  It feels really good working out again...and it's only a few months until I get my black belt!!  Yay!!

- I love Johnny Depp! ...but that's not new of course

Those actually weren't bullets, they were hyphens.  Terribly sorry for those of you who were looking forward to bullets.  Just remember, life sometimes holds disappointments.  

Anyway, looking back on 2004, it was a pretty good year :D.  I did some crazy stuff, but as it looks, this year promises to be crazier.  It's gonna be fun ;)

Hope everyone is rockin in their socks,

"event","Ok everyone...guess what I found out yesterday...

THE STUPID DMV DIDN'T HAVE ANY APPOINTMENTS OPEN BEFORE MY PERMIT EXPIRED!!!

So does this mean I don't get my licence until the middle of January...??

OF COURSE NOT!!

I HAVE TO GO TO SIMI VALLEY TO TAKE THE DRIVING TEST AND TAKE IT WITH MY DAD'S CAR WHICH I'M TOTALLY UNFAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE MY MOM'S IS BROKEN!  I'VE ONLY DRIVEN IN SIMI VALLEY LIKE 2 TIMES TOTAL!!

oh and here's the really good part...

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IT'S TOMORROW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

That's the only time we could make the appointment for.

So today I have to finish up my final 2 instructor hours.  Safety First (where I took my driver's training) didn't have any appointments open either, so I have to go take it with some place called Royal Driving School.  The good thing is that it's in Simi and I can get to know the roads down there a bit better.

So basically if I get my license in the next week, it'll be a miracle because first, the Simi Valley DMV has to let me take the test while I'm still 15.  Next, I have to try and pass this thing with a car that I've never really driven and in a foreign place where I've never really driven.  

Wishes me luckies!!

and also...

GOOD LUCKIES TO NATALIE WHO IS TAKING HER PERMIT TEST IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES!! YAY!

Lots of love everyone,

The hard part about X-mas is trying to decide what to buy people.  Like my sister and my Dad are both pretty easy, but my Mom is tough.  Nevertheless, I'm digging this whole Christmas thing.  Can't wait until this Saturday...and then the very next day I get to turn 16!  Yays for me!

I'm getting kinda nervous about this whole driving test thing.  I'm taking it on Friday (yes I'll still be 15) and then I'll pick up my license on Monday after I turn 16.  What if I fail it...or get some mean bitch who won't pass me?!  What if I'm driving and the car just suddenly stops and explodes!  Yea that would kinda suck.  

By the way...apologies to everyone for missing the X-mas party.  Sadly I was sick with a fever and stuff, and couldn't leave the house :'(.  I still am a bit sick, but it's getting better.  Jamie had it worse than I did.

Say did you guys know that masturbation is actually very good for you?  It turns out that you can lose like 60 to 80 calories for every orgasm you have.  Pretty sweet stuff!

Hope everyone's X-mas break is going well!  I love Johnny Depp! (that never gets old)

Man I miss karate so much, these few months have been hell without it.  This is one of the many reasons why I hate marching season :(. 

This last weekend we put our Christmas tree up.  We also went caroling with band which was pretty fun...(except for the embarrassing moments when Swagat was telling people that I would strip for them if they gave us money.)  I love the X-mas time of year because I get to wear santa hats and play Christmas music and get presents (of course Christmas isn't about presents, it's about the joy of giving *ya right*).  Plus my birthday is the day after X-mas, so I get two days of gifts and hugs and kisses :D! 

I have this stupid worksheet for Euro that I really should be doing right now, so I think I'm going to go.  Sorry for not updating in awhile!!

"event","We went to Pleasant Hill last weekend. Man it totally sucked. Not only was I sick as a dog (I couldn't speak half the trip), but we took 12th out of 14 bands in finals. ONLY ONE MORE COMP! I'm going to be so happy when marching season ends. 

I was sick before we left and I almost didn't go, but for some reason I felt this loyalty and dedication toward the band (go figure) and I went anyway. It got pretty bad during the couple of days we were away, and the only way I was able to hold myself up was to load up on every type of drug imaginable. On the way home, things were looking good: a nice 8 hour trip in a bus with a seat all to myself watching a whole bunch of stuff including Monsters Inc, Emperor's New Groove, Shrek 2, Elf, Cool Runnings, and some thing about a guy who was reincarnated as a snowman. Needless to say, the bus ride would have been much better if they had just popped some porn in the VCR. At least I was feeling better...or so I thought until about a half hour away from home. I got the worst headache I think I have ever had in my life (it felt like someone was drilling into the the side of my left ear with a jackhammer). Right after I got home from the comp my mom had to rush me to the hospital ER, where I spent most of my night.

Although I was sick, the Pleasant Hill trip did have some pleasant aspects. For instance, I got the flash most of Concord from my hotel window while Natalie busily took pictures from behind. After all, sickness must not keep me from my naughty, perverted ways. Also, the night when we got in, my roommates along with Ally from the next room got to jump on the beds, try and guess how big the penis is of just about every guy in band (actually only a few of them), and take part in some fun lesbo play. It was awesome :D.  

Right now it is Thanksgiving! HAPPY THANKSGIVING EVERYONE! My Aunt and cousins are visiting from AZ, and since they got in a little late, I don't get to have Thanksgiving dinner till tomorrow night. I just kinda sat around all day (when I really should have been doing homework). 

Hey by the way, I LOVE my english class!! We're watching a movie and one of the characters is really hot. There was a scene where he was getting a massage, so his shirt was off, he was covered in oil, and although he wasn't completely naked, he had on a pair of tight, leather pants. Plus he's really cut, so Summer and I were all like ""damn he's ripped!"" I was getting wet that day in english class. Yes indeed! 

It's getting a little late (not really but I'm using this as an excuse so I can go masturbate.) Good night to all (I'm gonna go upstairs and get naked and naughty) *slaps self* Apologies to everyone...Kristie's a little to hyped up on sugar, and we all know what happens when Kristie has too much sugar...*cough* oral sex *cough*

Hugs, kisses, and blow jobs to all,

"event","We've had a couple of band comps since I last updated:

The first one was a WBA comp where we competed with MV, Upland, and Logan.  Needless to say we lost terribly.  We were also behind the rest by like 6-8 points (I forgot).  I still say we have politics with WBA.

The other one we just did yesterday in Oxnard.  It was SCSBOA so it was pretty sweet.  We took all captions and our score broke 90.  :D  I was sooooo tired afterward I just kinda passed out on the bus (although it was hard with the pack of guys in the back singing).  Also, Mr. Martone made us stand up at the end of the field for awards.  We stood for like an hour.  After ten minutes I had lost the feeling in my legs.  It was chilly! (despite the fact that I had like four layers of clothing) ;)

Today is a work on my Macbeth essay and do history worksheets because I can't do them next weekend since we are going to Stockton for WBA championships day. (Was that a run-on sentence?)  Oh by the way, I GET MY LICENSE IN A MONTH AND 12 DAYS!! :D ...just for the record. 

Lots of love everyone!  Kristie is going to go do her english homework now.

Pretty much the whole bus ride there I tried to study history but I couldn't cuz the movies they were playing were so loud. I didn't get much work done (especially since I had both Nick AND Pete sitting behind me.)

We took 4th place out of 27 bands!! Not too shabby! We got 5th in prelims and then took 4th in finals. Upland won...big surprize...

On Friday night my roomies and I straightened Michelle's hair! So much fun! We're getting her a hair-straightener for her birthday. She seemed to really like it.

The whole weekend was basically filled with friends, music, marching, NEW SEXY GAUNTLETS, and really fattening food...I mean REALLY fattening, I think I gained like ten pounds over the course of two days!

Right now I have my magazine project for history due on Tuesday. My whole group is coming over to put it together on Monday. I'm working the entire weekend starting right after I type this thing. I even had to cancel my Halloween plans cuz I have so much work to do. :( However, once this history project and my other english project that's due this upcoming week is finished, I will have a large amount of stress released. Who knows...I might even go on AIM sometime after this weekend!

Must get back to homework. I also have to practice since I'm recording tomorrow.

Sorry I've been so busy. This weekend I've had homework, band, band, and more band. Plus I've been sick with a cold, so life isn't fun right now. On Friday we had a football game. It was actually a lot of fun. We got to face the crowd, which kinda sucked cuz we couldn't see the game that well. I got to make faces at my sister for most of the time hehe. The show went REALLY well. We didn't tear at all :D. Also, we got to wear our sexy new uniforms. Super snazy!

Yesterday we had our very fist competition of the year! The bus ride there was fun. I spent my time listening to Celine Dion, talking to Natalie, and laughing at the guys in the back who were singing just about every song that has ever been invented at the top of their lungs. When we got there we did basics for 2 hours then ate and changed. Our performance didn't go so well. I didn't mess up, but the group tore in a bunch of different places. Needless to say, Etawanda killed us, but I think that was expected. Our score was like 82 point something. 

Right now I've got three major projects I'm working on...(stupid magazine for history especially) Must get back to work. Taking the PSAT next weekend...so I've got to get some of this stuff done cuz there will be no time next week.

"event","Hey everyone, sorry I haven't updated in a week. I've been doing homework every spare second I get. It's crazy. 

We had a football game yesterday. Pretty fun, except that I had three tests the next day (including Euro History which I totally bombed today) I got to cram on my kanji in Japanese though, so I think I did okay on that one. 

Yesterday's band practice before the football game sucked. I was totally out of it. Mr. Martone asked the band to march and sing, but of course since I was out in Kristieland, I didn't hear him. We were facing backward and the entire band started marching the drill and singing while I was just singing. I stood in my starting spot for like 5 pages before I realized that my section was half-way across the field without me. Then I had to low-walk/sprint to catch up to them. The entire band is marching and then there's this crazy alto sax playing dashing across the field. IT WAS SO EMBARRASSING!! >< It was even more embarrassing than the time that my neckstrap made all the buttons on my shirt come undone in band class and I didn't notice it for like the whole period. So meanwhile everyone can see my fully-exposed bra and I'm acting like I don't even care. 

Today I was kind of out of it too. Band practice was hot (not like sexy hot but the bad kind of temperature hot). We learned new drill for the second movement. I hate the second movement, it's so boring! The altos have straight eighth notes for half the song, and the other half we're just holding notes. 

Oh by the way, Summer and I have started a new organization called the CMTWA (Chain-Mail Thong Wearers Anonymous). Super fun! Tell me or Natalie if you want to join!!

I've got to go work on my history homework (The Prince is due on Thursday).

You know what I would really like to do right now?

I have a question, is it normal to have six hours of homework every night? Are they trying to kill us or something?! I wish I had like some sort of time stopping machine to create more hours in the day...

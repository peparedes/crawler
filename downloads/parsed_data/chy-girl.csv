"event","hi everyone, things here are great.  Matt and Julie moved away this weekend I will befinately miss them bunches. We totally got along great.  Other than that work is work, play is play and sex is sex.  Also I did have a couple of interviews I hope I get more I'm looking for a new job quickly.  My new car is expensive to run with the horrible gas prices.  Right now everyone is watching the family guy on fox or whatever.  It's an alright show but other than that the night is calm the nieghbors actually are having a party somewhere else.  It's so nice there is no boom boom shaking the walls.  I must be getting old.  Also Angelique moved away to san diego which means that she no longer works with me!!! I'm sooooooo happy.  For everyone who was here for the ranting they all feel the happiness.

anyways..
best wishes

"event","hello everyone, I notice that not everyone has been quite as busy as I.  I did get to go to so cal about a week ago.  It was great.  I saw my sis.  I am helping her with her wedding which has been a blast.  Also, since I am one of her bridesmaids we looked at dreses that don't make me look horrible.  I also have been going to the gym regularly.  I find it relaxes me. Wierd I know but it really does work out for the best.  I have found that the spin class is my friend I wish that I could do it everyday but knowing me I'd then get sick of it.  You know the saying if you always want more you wont get sick of it.  Also I got my nails done today.  And they are alittle too short and I hate that, but it's better than being too long then I can't do anything.  Well everyone I thought that I would say hi. and that I haven't forgotten about all of you but that I was gone and that I have been busy.  Well best wishes

I was going to tell tf5 that his car was towed because when I read the last mail he didn't mention it.  Plus we aren't  quite with the internet yet.  They have to dig the line. And if some of the spelling is wrong it's because of the powerful margaritas that my dad has been making at his house.  Ok other than that I hope that everything is goig ok and that i will try to check my messages more often.  love ya'll

He who cannot be named will be gone until saturday I have missed him like no tomorrow.  HE has been gone for about a week and a half.  Just had a coversation with D, by the way you didn't give us the number to the shop.  I hope that everything is going ok there.  Just remember beeee yourself.  Other than that I have been loving my new car. The only bad part has been feeding it.  It's not quite what I'm used to. What else, oh, my next door neighbors haven't removed the couch from the carport yet.  It looks so tacky.  And they say their from Granite Bay.  What are they waiting for their parents to pay someone to take it?????  Had to throw something sarcastic in.  It's been there over a week. Maybe I'll just call thr front office. They can have someone come give them a note.  Because I'm sick of looking at it. And they are just big pot heads anyways, well wish me luck in kickboxing, it's my new thing at the gym.

things have been both fun and exciting.  I now have no roommmates, they couldn't pay rent so they left. So far on better terms then the last ones.  But Ican say that the house has been the quietest since we've lived there. About a year and a half ago.  we are watching 24 I love that show.  Being that we are now broke, what else is there to do other then just going to teh gym and watching tv.  We have been trying to sleep.  Those who know what this is like, know how hard it really is to sleep. Other then that work work work.  Thats all I seem to do now.  I'lll be going around looking for a second job or just a new one. wish me luck everyone.......

"event","well I am going towrads reno tomorrow. That means that on wednesday I will be sleeping in my own bed.  Boy, does that sound great. I picked up some more movies yesterday. Jawbreaker, that is one of my fav's. I never thought that you could choke on a jawbreaker. And Princess diaries two, we saw it when we got here and I liked it alot.  Just as much as the first one.  and as lastly, The best little whore house in Texas.  with Dolly Parten. I think that I just spelt that wrong. I remember that movie when I was young.  My parents used to watch it alot. They told me it was a grown-up's movie. HA!!! Yeah right.
well I will not be typing until wednesday so I hope that the next few days are a fun time.  Behave everyone

It does make less but hey it's a job right.  Just remember that we are supporting you over here in Idaho.  I'm glad that juniper is doing ok.  We miss her.  Just like we miss the rest of you.  Oh I got Julie toe socks while we have been here.  They have peace signs on them. They are so cute.  Also if you feel like you really need to break up with him that is ok with us.  If you need some more support just ask.  It's also fine with us that you will be packed.  I did assume that you were talking about the clothes being at our house.  What else i may or may not agree with your mother.  I'm sure she has her best thoughts for you in her heart.  Gotta go
we wish you a merry x-mas etc...

"event","hey I hope that everything was or is going ok.  It is creep'n cold up here. it was 17degrees last night freeze my non-existant balls off.  just thought that I would tell everyone that we are ok.  The drive was fun, it was cold in reno.  We got ice all over the car, we watched it fall off.  Then here I got to watch snow fall for the first time in my life.  Which was awsome. The grandparents are in great spirts.  They are just happy we all could be here.
I'm glad  but I really miss home.  I really want the warmth, and more than that I want to see my mom and dad, and juniper the most.  I miss her.  If I did this alone without he could not be named, would be horrible.  So everyone merry x-mas.  I wish the most joyful and wondrful christmas to everyone.

merry christmas, happy new year

Have any of you heard of eyelash tinting? Well I will let you all know how that works out.  I'm kinda scared so wish me luck.  Oh and work has been great it is called not having to go, because I have been on call.  So they haven't needed me.  We meaning woo and I went ot the mimi's at Arden and we were treated horribly.  The waitress thought that we didn't even have enough money to even be there.  So we were ignored. Like normal when you are young and they really don't know anything.  The fun part is that when she handed us the bill.  I then gave her my pay check and asked for the bill to be modified.  Then it was like a lightbulb went off in her head.  Oh my god, this girl works at a mimi's then she it was day and night.  We were great and she kissed our ass after that.  Being that I was friends with the manager.  So that was wonderful.  She was sooooooo embarassed.  It felt great here honey have a piece of humble pie. thought all you should know

But truely would you forgive him???? I wouldn't and haven't. And probly wont.  I know that sounds kinda harsh, but I do feel that way even if it is alittle bitchy.  I can't help that so there.....  I love to throw temper tantrums.  And that my friends was it.  WOW, I know it's extreme...  Anyways I do have to work thanksgiving and that will be so much fun!!!! Yuck!!!!  A whole bunch of people who either don't know how to cook or just plain don't want to.  They all go a resturant and think that they are the only ones.  Needless to say, we were full for reso's by the 4th of this month.  How sad.  People make friends and find family.  HELLO.  Don't you think that those lovely people who wait on you at the resturants have families???  What if they had made plans and how nice of you to be so selfish.  Here have some humblepie and turkey and don't forget to come again.  Sill I'm not counting the people who did take-out dinners.  So just wondering does anyone know where their oven is?????  And is it really that hard to turn it to 250 degrees????  Plus we all know how hard it is to bast the turkey once an hour..  j/k Alright just a little of ranting and raving.  I understand that poeple need to go to the grocery store to grab things.  I guess it proves that most of the world has procrastinators in it...  I know I also can be one of them.  Can't we all... But!, if the stores and resturants in the world decided that one year that they were going to stay closed how many people would go hungry??  Let us count the hundreds of thousands around the U.S.  One... Two... Hundred....  j/k. Actually I'm not...  Nadia I though that you should know who I'm not talking to it's Mike...  Jeff and I are not talking with him.  He does have drinking problem and needs help the problem is that he doesn't see it or just doesn't want to be helped.  We all have tried but to no avail, if you can't tell.  So now there is no talking between us. And Jeff doesn't plan on changing that for some time.  Sorry to be the person with bad news..

What else is new.  He is asking for his phone back so now he will not be able to call long distance and well thats not our fault. :) Take better care of your bills and you will be able to talk on a phone.  He does have money in his pocket but he will not buy his own phone.  Go figure.  What else, I do have to be on call tomorrow.  So I might work but might not. I hate being in limbo.  I feel like I want to have fun but they could say chy we need youtoday come in.  And it could be one of those work 'till I don't know 5pm I surely hope not.

There are a few of you know who want the heck I'm talking about and would like to do the same. :) Needless to say there are fewer people on my friends list and more problems in my life then I would like to say.  I'm sure that we have all been there. I had an argument with an ex-friend last night.  Plus he really got upset, but little does he know that his bestfriend is no longer his bestfriend.  And by the way...  get over it.....  wait look at whom I'm talking about. So now is the time to ask for everything back..  Oh wait jeff already thought of that....  For everything else on the list of bitch'n is that my work sucks but guess what...  it's work if it was fun would it still be work??????  What else I'm tired... no more going to bed at 3o'clock for me.

"event","well I not only found out some great news but also found out some not so great news...  I did find out that the grudge movie is not quite what I thought it was going to be.  There are things in it that I would find extremely offensive.  So I will not see it.  And if I do then it will have to wait for the dvd release.  But the whole idea of murdering aminals and suicide plus killing your family.  Not what I would find fun.  Plus why should I waste my money.  Another plus we are getting our washer and dryer on monday hopefully we can find someone to stay over until it is delivered.  Maybe I'll ask my mom.  Then I will buy her lunch if she wants to come over to my work. OR if all else fails call in sick.  Which would be a bad thing.  I really really really (etc) need the money.  On a different subject my birthday is getting ever so much closer about nineteen days. December never quite comes fast enough or delays quite enough for me.  Oh I almost forgot...  I do have a mimi's story of the day.... really ok
there was a family of three. Two children and a mother.  A kid wanted to order a chicken fingers and the mom said no, because they were fried not baked.  So the kid didn't eat anything.. A kid a growing kid, he was a little over weight.  The mom ordered a patty melt with extra onions and with a whole heck of a lot of grease..  Funny how things work, did I mention that she weighed about 350lbs????

So The grudge here I come.  I also have to ask my dad if he can cut down a table for my work.  IT is too way too big.  They bought it about a foot to big.  What morons..  That definately explains my work to a T.  Ihope that doesn't reflect on me.  Which I am sure that it does.  What else can I talk about, my ar is driving beautifully.  It couldn't be better but it does need brakes in the recent future.  They are starting to squeek.  Draven thanks for the hit back.  I definately that it was fun, we are very goo dat the rapid fire.  It was almost like we practiced.  I did do laudry yesterday, about all 10 leads of it.  And if Jeff says that he doesn't have any clothes then he can suck his own right nut.  After seeing all those clothes I hate laundry.  And you never find out how much you have until you wash it all.

what else.....
the wonderful person at my work called in sick today.  I really do hope that she is feeling better soon.  IT has become fun watching her squirm.  She does it well and now one fels bad for her.  You mess with one of us and you mess with us all.  Ha!!!! take that... :)  She never thought that it would back fire on her.  Or at least it seems that way...

Anyways I thought that I'd tell everyone that the girl that I am talking about not only is not able to sue me but called me a bitch in front of the regional manager.  Ha take that.  But I thought everyone who reads this would like to know.  I guess I'm not really all that bad.  My fav manager said that from now on we were going to share a section at work.  Ha ha ha very funny.  And that we are going to be in the same room just to piss her off.  I know that wont happen so thats alright.  I love my job at times but we all here know how much it can strain you.  At least they all stuck up for me when I really needed it.  Maybe it's because they can trust me and maybe because I'm not a flake.  What else oh my car is getting new tires 2morrow.  I'm excited it is fun driving the van but I would really like to have my own car back.  And Draven did give me new news about the jobs opening in this area which is awsome.  There are no bad things happening on the home front.  I do need a new washer and dryer but those can be found, hopefully easly.  If the money is there.  I could save my money and they will be bought.  Jeff and I are going to Hawaii next year and we are both very excited.  We are not quite sure where to go though.  I've been so it doesn't matter to me. IT does on the other hand feel good that I have been somewhere and Jeff hasn't.  The tables are turned in my favor for once.  At least there is no ranting and raving here tonight.  Wish me luck on tips 2morrow.

Anyways she was affended when I asked if she was the token black person. Oh my josh the crap hit the bleep'n fan. Now she wants to sue me  for personal damage.  Is it my fault that she is but hurt. Somewhat, I did apologise and did tell her that I didn't quite mean it the way that she took it.  So she simmered until earlier today and she talked with a manager not just anyone of them, but my regional.  He did stick up for me, and I was writen up.  Big woop!!! Still I really think that she took this alittle out of proportion.  I really didn't eman it that way.  Granted I really hated signing that write up and she did ask for a transfer.  But is it truely my fault that she went around telling everyone and all they would say is that she was tripp'n on something pretty harsh.  Anyways other then that, today was wonderful.  I did on the other hand I did have a great conversation we feel the same way about this topic, but I do have to pay the game smarter then she will think that I will.  I think that she did this to get under my skin.  I will not let her think that she did.  If you does she wins.  She will not win this.

So I will talk later, Draven give Jeff a call we need to talk,

"event","I have realized that either my cellular phone either didn't like me or just wanted to run away.  My reasoning is simple, someone decided that they maybe wanted my phone more than I did and in result is I have no phone.  Also if you have a phone you know it adores attention.  So I hope you are happy wherever you may be.  I hope that they do pay great attention to you, after all I only had you for about 1 month.  On the 10th it would have been a whole month.  Alright no more feeling sorry for myself.  On a lighter note, my wedding ring stone fell out today, but there is good news; I took the ring back to Jared's where it was purchused and they gave me a new ring.  Because the stone was more expensive then the ring value to-date.  So I have a new ring.  Yeah!!  Oh I mean Voooottttttt. Hope everyones day went well

"event","now I can believe that being a geek is not as bad as I though before.
I complete the geek pledge with pride. "" I Chyanne am a geek, I am not afraid of this.  I will remember who helped me come to grips with this realization. Thank-you all.""
Other than that more new from the home front.
Jeff has had a death in his family, please a momment of no key strokes, and pause for silence.... Thanks
And I went to a party and now my celluar phone is missing. It grew legs and walked away????  I don't think so. The reality of that is slim to none.  IT could've had help. What else????
I have to get new tires? :)  I have a slow/fast leek in one.  (that is classified as a leek that is slow but the tire goes flat faster than I would like) What else, my work has just about killed me for the third year in a row.  I have decided that being a food server is not quite what I think I should do for the rest of my hopefully long life.  Maybe it's off to something else.  Yes!!!!!!!!!  Or for other people, vOOOTTT!!! Alright all any sugestions tell me
best wishes

"event","Jeff as come to realization that I am a Geek.!! Great, so now I talk to people through a computer so I guess that makes me a geek!
I think no, I work and I really enjoy having fun, but I guess I wear nearly broken glasses, held together by only a piece of schotch tape.  Clear not white.  I won't compromise my appearance.  What else, oh karma kicked one of my customers' in the be-hymen.  She was mean and snobish, and guess what happened when she tried to pay???????  Guesses anyone????
DECLINED  not once but three times with three different cards.   But come to find out she had a stack about an inch thick..  Ouch hate to be her significant other.....

anyways gotta go hope everyone is happy.

"event","hi everyone, today was one of the best/worst days!!
For everyone who doesn't know yet,::::::
I have a bad cough it's called broccidas? I can't spell sorry
so now they gave me two more antiboctics to take with the other 3.
Still the good part is that Jeff and I got to watch movies last night and all three were good,
Mean girls was very corny but for a teen girly-girl movie not bad
The Punisher was good also it have great action and also they did mix in some great and ironic humor.
50 first dates, was extremely funny, I love Adam Sandler and plus that movie was for his father who died.  He is a great guy!!
well I better go..
I hope Draven isn't mad me, my phone and it's stupid reception.  Other than that hi everyone I hope you day was great.  And smile it not only makes your face crack, but it also makes the black ugly clouds go away.

love ya'll
best wishes

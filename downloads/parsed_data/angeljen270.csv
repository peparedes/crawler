"event","So...we ended up going to playoffs in volleyball. In brawly, but we lost. But thats ok, I think that was one of the funnest trips I have ever been on! Jackie...its a mc. spoony spoon straw! it used to be that way when I was little, don't you remember? gggggg street. Holly's Sugar, that means its a sugar factory because it says holly's sugar. Tough times tom...I think you choking was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

Ryan is my idol..he is the HOTTEST guy in the world. When I look at him I want to melt. Hearing his voice sends chills down my spine. The way he does his hair makes me want him soooo badly. Someday I'm going to marry him.

must be your skin that i'm sinking in :: must be for real 'cos now i can feel :: and i didn't mind :: it's not my kind :: it's not my time to wonder why :: everything gone white :: and everything's grey :: now you're here now you're away :: i don't want this :: remember that :: i'll never forget where you're at :: don't let the days go by :: glycerine

i'm never alone :: i'm alone all the time :: are you at one :: or do you lie :: we live in a wheel :: where everyone steals :: but when we rise it's like strawberry fields

if i treated you bad :: you bruise my face :: couldn't love you more :: you got a beautiful taste :: don't let the days go by :: could have been easier on you :: i couldn't change though i wanted to :: could have been easier by three :: our old friend fear and you and me :: glycerine :: don't let the days go by :: glycerine

i needed us more :: when we wanted us less :: i could not kiss just regress :: it might just be :: clear simple and plain :: that's just fine :: that's just one of my names :: don't let the days go by :: could've been easier on you :: glycerine"

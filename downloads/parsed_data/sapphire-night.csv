Well I hope all has been well with everyone. I've been alright ^-^

So what you've missed:
&nbsp;my brother had a kid with Sara who turned out to be a bit of a loon when she decided to run away from a perfectly good place here and then had the kid and hasn't (to this day) let my brother see her. My brother met another girl and married her last year. She's a beautiful girl named Columbia :D I love her, I'm glad she's my sister-in-law. ^-^

Bri, Rachael and I went to Hawaii in August of 07 with my mom and grandma; we had a blast. Still developing comics titled &quot;the Hawaii Chronicles&quot; :D

Dan and I started dating and things are going great, we're actually engaged now :D

As a family, in the summer of 09, my dad, mom, brother, sisters, brother-in-law, 7 grandkids, Columbia, Dan and I went to Florida and the&nbsp;Caribbean&nbsp;on a Disney cruise! It was awesome! We were at Disneyland for 4 days and stayed at the Grand Floridian hotel!! it was so beautiful and nice there. We could see the fireworks show and everything from our room. It was&nbsp;ridiculously&nbsp;humid there, but otherwise a very enjoyable experience. Malachi and Columbia got engaged on the beach in the&nbsp;Bahamas and then got married in March. If anyone is debating on taking a cruise at all, I highly suggest the Disney Cruise Line.&nbsp;Totally awesome.

Dan proposed to me on my birthday 2010, some &quot;law- abiding-neighbor&quot; set off illegal fireworks at just the right time to make it awesome for us :D

I finished Drama school at SDCCD and have taken a year off of school to try and find some acting jobs... needless to say, it's been rough.

Dan and I (along with family and friends) are planning for a December wedding at Disneyland in CA. It's gonna be awesome :D

Stay tuned for more, because this year is definitely gonna be one for the books &gt;w&lt; So exciting!"

I'm sure its for the better, but I suppose now it'll be a bit harder.<br />My brother's coming home today with his girlfriend, Sarah.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Please"">If you don't know I'm speaking about my brother...I love him dearly but he's gotten himself into way deep water and now it's gonna be difficult to get back to a place where he can touch the bottom.

Went to the fair last week...and that was loads of fun, but only because we were all such goofballs &gt;w&lt; Bri-bear screamed on the crazy mouse ride and Dan and I couldn't stop laughing... seriously the constant screaming made us laugh and by the end of the ride my stomach was in so much pain. We bought the picture XD I also introduced Dan to the pearl game... or whatever its called where you pick an oyster and you get a pearl... because he never knew that existed and amazingly got twins (two pearls in one oyster) on his very first try!<br />so yeah we all had lotsa fun... oh! we also shot stuff and went into fun houses &gt;w&lt;<br /><br />anyways not much has been happening for me, sytill looking for a job and all but otherwise I've just been writing stories and looking up names for characters.<br /><br />well that's all for now...<br /><br />ja mata!"

"event","Well I've been busy... and now I'm not. Now I'm bored and broke... I need a job... but no one seems to want to hire me... which really sucks *sigh*<br />well the past three weeks have been a blast :D<br />mostly &gt;w&lt;<br />I had a lot of fun the first week that school was out. We did like nothing XD it was great &gt;w&lt;<br />And then my Uncle, his GF and my cousin and his girlfriend Ana came... and I played chauffeur for an entire week.<br />It wasn't too bad... the first day I took them to the mall... my brother drove too... that was annoying. (great amount of irritation). I love my brother be he's such a pain because he never treats me with any respect and I have this distinct feeling that he hates that I'm smarter than him....<br />anyways... so that was fine.. after the mall we went to CPK for dinner, Dan came too. we all had fun and the Pizza was so yummy!!<br />Friday we went to the beach!!! whooo beach!!! that was so fun, but the water was so cold Adrian (my cousin) and Anna had a lot of fun. Anna had never been to the beach before so it was a real treat for her ^_^ Dan met us at the beach and pretty much ran into the water with the boogie board. Dan had just agreed to teach Adrian how to boogie board, but he'd stopped in his tracks when Dan ran into the water and asked ""do I have to do <b>that</b>?"" I responded with a no... he's just a lil crazy about the ocean. After the boogie board lessons Dan nearly dunked me in the water... since I'd not been completely in the water yet.... it was cold and I knew it was coming there was nothing I could do to stop it &gt;.&lt;<br /><br />Saturday we went to the zoo! whooo! we left at like 11..... and then had breakfast/lunch so we actually got to the Zoo at 2:30... there was a lot of people since it was a Saturday, but all in all it was a lot of fun. When we went home we relaxed and plyed video games that Dan brought over with his X-box... so much fun &gt;w&lt;<br /><br />Sunday was church *nod* we all had fun actually. And then we went to Ralph's to pick up some more steaks and stuff for the bbq! We also annoyed Dan and Bri who work at Ralph's &gt;w&lt; that was fun &gt;w&lt;<br />The BBQ was fun and yummy and no one sang or pulled out a guitar...so that was great.<br />Dan was there too and was getting picked on by the family, which was hilarious &gt;w&lt;<br />My brother was there.... with his new girlfriend Sarah (we won't get into the interesting details about how long they'd been together) and another friend of theirs who was there to help Malachi move out to Arizona that afternoon with Sarah...<br />So my bro's been in Arizona for the past month, he's coming out this weekend for a baseball tryout... it's weird but not...<br /><br />Monday was a quiet mall day and we all had fun*nod*<br /><br />Tuesday!!!!!! We went to Universal studios!!! hahaha!! that was so much fun. Bri and Dan went with me, my uncle, his GF Jenny, my cousin Adrian and Anna. ^-^ Bri and Anna had never been to Universal Studios and so we all had a blast. and I figured out the I get cranky and tired when I haven't had enough to eat *nod* ... so did everyone else.&gt;.o<br />we managed to get Bri to go on The Jurassic Park river adventure ride...and that my friends was AWESOME XD<br />Initially Dan and I had told her that there was only a little drop and it was just a calm lil boat ride and it would be fun ^-^ So she went without a worry and yelled at the dinosaurs who got her hair wet throughout the ride... it was great XD<br />and then the finally came.... the final huge drop escaping the T-rex and the raptors into the water below....<br />she screamed and I couldn't stop laughing... here is the result.<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/sapphire_night/pic/0000116s/""><img width=""169"" height=""240"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/sapphire_night/pic/0000116s/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br />Bri and Dan look Hilarious &gt;w&lt; My Aunt Jenny looks so scared too XD and you can't see me because my cousin decided to put his hand up covering my entire face *pout* all in all the whole trip was a success &gt;w&lt;<br />oh yes, did I mention I had to drive a whale boat? yes a whale boat, that is what the dodge caravan thingy was dubbed at the beginning of our trip. We wouldn't all fit in one of our cars so to save on gas we ended up renting a mini-van. *nodnod*<br /><br />Anyways it was a whole lot of fun and a great end to my family's trip to California. ^-^<br />Oh yeah Bri, Dan and me all got characictures of ourselves...I forced Dan, and that was fun, but it didn't fit into my scanner so you don't get to see it.<br /><br />After that things went by slowly... and we really haven't done much since. I've been on the job hunt...and so far I've come up empty...and I really miss Drama.... T-T<br /><br />anyways I gotta go now since I have to vacuum the house and then shower before going to the beach.....as has been decided by the boy (aka Dan).<br /><br />ja mata!"

I think I'll join the major because I had so much fun &gt;w&lt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not miss Trig... I'll be happy if I pass the stupid class... my prof was a nazi.... hate *hiss* You know he actually showed up late for the final; giving me LESS time to complete it... and no, I did not finish the final... I almost did... but I was a few problems short *eye twitch*<br />So that was irritating.<br />English was a breeze, but I like writing so it was an easy class for me. Poli sci was fine, I studied and I'm sure I passed the class with an A or at least&nbsp; B. Architecture... well drafting the final was 13 pages of answer questions and then like 5 pages or actual drawing... the final lasted 3 hours... the en tire class... I think I missed 3-4 questions. But I can safely say that I am so happy that class is over. I hated that prof too... nasty woman was so friggin' picky about every damn thing... one day I wanted to stab her eyes out... another day I wanted to slit her throat with my architect's scale... which is rather blunt and would have been messy... so I kept the violence in my head where it belongs.<br />Drama... oh drama... I seriously miss the class. I think it was the only class I looked forward to and actually put heart felt effort into it. I love acting ...working with people who also love acting. My last scene partner was the best.<br /><img width=""228"" height=""170"" alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v201/FairyBug/re-life/RickyandMal.jpg"" />&nbsp;Ricky, I got to work with him twice because, for the final, we were short a few people and I was left without a scene partner. So he graciously allowed me to double up with him and Silver (one of my previous scene partners). We did a scene from The Woods by David Mamet, and it was awesome. Everyone saw a completely different side of me and I blew them all away &gt;w&lt; In all my previous scenes I'd been this sadistic, controlling, violent bitch so it was nice that in this scene I got to show something else that most people rarely get the chance to see (happy, loving, teasing and bubbly)... and I was real.<br />Anyways I had a blast and I'm definitely going back next semester, heck I might even join the major &gt;w&lt;<br /><br />After classes were over we all celebrated with sushi!!! &gt;w&lt; home-made of course, by me :D we had fun and ate... a lot &gt;w&lt;and now I forgot what I was going to say because the stupid picture isn't working.... *stare*<br />anyways I might actually get a job this summer. I'll be working at Visual Photography, if I get the job, which I think I might, so that'll be cool :D making money is always good *sage nod*<br />I also hope to take a lot of pictures and have wonderfully funny, misadventures with my friends this summer &gt;w&lt;<br />&lt;3 you guys!<br /><br />and well that's all for now... I gotta figure out what's happening tonight and then I'm off to do stuff :D<br /><br />ja mata!!"

Plain, simple and the girl next door. People tend overlook you as you are the ""normal girl"", but you're actually very beautiful. And you have plenty about you to set you apart, but more that lets you blend. People love the stability you have because as others may come and go, you will always be there and you may always be the same. You like simple things and that's what people like about you. You most likely enjoy things most consider normal, like movies, shopping, that sort of thing and are very friendly and probably have many friends. You are sweet and kind and that shows on you, but you're also strong and not very naive. You're a rather well-rounded individual.

You, my ambitious friend, are going places, following your dreams. Good for you. Few people chase their dreams anymore. Never give that up. You are heading up in the world, making a name for yourself, even if it's just a small group who know it. You're finding your way and are heading straight for the top. You've got all the qualities of a great leader and are probably a very optimistic individual. Though you can be a bit selfish at times and have a tendency to step over people in your way. You must watch that. You could end up hurting the ones you love if you put your own goals above them. Never lose faith in that dream of yours, but make sure you can keep those close to you because in the end they'll be the ones to get you through the tough times. You have found your place and yourself, few can do so well and still struggle to find themselves. Don't let go of that sense of self you have even in times of confusion, it will help you pull through. Be careful of your ego too, you could lose your balances and once you're at the top, it's a very long way down. So be mindful of others, strive forward to reach your dream, whatever it may be, be true to yourself, and you keep going up. Don't let anyone pull you down. <a href=""http://quizilla.com/redirect.php?statsid=17&amp;url=http://www.quizilla.com/users/Jai16/quizzes/What Path Do You Take In Life? [X]For Guys and Gals!

"event","So far spring break has been nice and relaxing.....and every morning my head feels like it weighs ten pounds more than it should...which is weird O_o...but once I'm actually up everything is ok! :D
Well I've got homework to do today... blah... along with a bunch of other chores and I still have to take the pups for a run :D

Anyways there's not much to report 'cept for the fun we've all been having with everyone down here.
Saturday we (Bri, Danny, Lizzy and Me) all played dart tag in my front yard :D 't was fun :D Danny fell and was hurt, but he's ok...ended up he only skinned his elbow and his knee. Which is good because it could have been a lot worse considering he tried to slide over my wall, but one of the bricks was loose, and he slipped and fell landing on the other little wall and then landing on the driveway &gt;.o
but he's ok!
Sunday night&nbsp; we (Bri, Danny, Rach and Me) played dart tag indoors because no one else was home and it was cold out side &gt;.&lt;
That was so much fun! My house was built to play dart tag! &gt;w&lt; muwahahaha!! one of these days I shall video tape our grand adventures &gt;w&lt; cause it's awesome &gt;w&lt;
Monday night, last night, we (Lizzy, Rach, Danny, and Me) played dart tag at Lizzy's park, aka Star Ridge Park, that was awesome! I'm such a happy hunter XD (who apparently has 1 new crush in Poway...according to the annoying advertisement to my right) anyways It was all great fununtil something started hunting us.
After that the game was called and we went back to Lizzy's house.... no one was in the mood to wrestle a coyote, mountain lion, or wolf.... or just be hunted by something that wasn't in the game in the first place.
Upon our return we discovered that Buddy, Lizzy's dog, had gotten into the chocolate chip cookies, that I'd made and brought ...and he'd eaten some of them. *sigh* oh well at least they're good enough to steal.
After that we all played Smash Brothers Brawl on the Wii and had lotsa laughs. We also played Wii bowling./..which I won, surprisingly...which was an unexpected upset, mainly because Danny was set to win with at that game.

Then we all went home...and slept....
which now brings you all the way to now... at which time I must say TTFN and dash away and run with my pups...and clean my dusty, dusty room &gt;.o before doing other chores...all before 2:30 @-@
but hey I can do it because I'm me!

ja mata! *salutes*

"event","Well I've been away for a while... again &gt;.o
School, work, and life have taken over time.

School has been evil.... My Tuesday/ Thursday classes are great, though there are a few issues with them. Like my lettering in Architecture... I'm sorry I have sloppy had writing, but at least I'm trying... And Drama...was well... that class cause me a minor break down...&gt;.o You can only take so much ""I don't know what you were doing, but that was crap"" while in a class where you're really trying because you actually care about the class. In any case I'm doing far better in both classes now. I'm actually ahead of my arch class and I'm finally climbing the mountain of positives in my drama class.

Monday/Wednesday classes are a far different story. *stare of doom*
Mondays are filled with English, Trig and Poli. Sci. Wednesdays only have English and Trig.
Poli Sci is just boring because all my prof does is talk...and talk and talk and talk and talk.....
English. Well there has been a huge battle there regarding my grade....because it should be an ""A"" but the prof decided she wanted to be anal and actually count all the words on my first 2 essays...and then decided I didn't have enough words.&nbsp; (I needed 1000 each). Once I fixed that problem I had an ""A"" on the first essay and a Zero on the second.
Yes.
That's right.
A Zero.
I snapped. I wanted to strangle this woman. And I probably would have ....but I still needed my grade. So I stayed after class and argued with her for about 20 minutes until I had to go to my next class. I'd planned on bombarding her with e-mails, but she e-mailed me first. Then there was a vollying of e-mails until this morning when i finally got her to take my essay and re-grade it after I got her to admit that she was wrong :D
Trig is another story. I'm averaging a ""C"" in that class right now.... and that's bad. Especially since I already took the class in HS. Why you ask am I averaging a ""C""? well here is your answer: I am a slow test taker. I like to make sure I'm right. This is not possible with only 45 minutes to take the test. On the first test I scored a D+ ... I'd missed an entire page of problems.... had I actually seen and completed the page I'd've scored a B+.... -.-()&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second test I scored an F+
Wow pretty sucky right? Granted I didn't really study too much for this test, however I didn't get to finish 5 problems.... which means I would've had a C+ on the test instead of an F+..... When I asked for more time on the next tests the response made me want to poke out one of his eyes. More time was not going to be given to me because I didn't have a note or a disability. I plan on yelling at him before our next test. I'm paying for the class. He's getting paid to teach the class. Therefore he orks for me. I will no longer be ""requesting"" more time. I'm demanding it. And as an educator he is required to give me more time... or I will take it to the dean.

oh yes I can be the student from hell... especially when I only need these classes because the previous ones that I've already taken don't count... or as far as my math class goes failing me for not showing all the work that I do in my head.... *eye twitch* (oh yes that happened. I tried to appeal the grade and got ignored.)

Anyways, more good things should be happening now days. Things are actually looking up and I think I might actually know what I want to do with my life now.
I'm going to major in Architecture and minor in drama and maybe music too ^_^
I have huge dreams and I plan on full-filling them...and surprisingly there's someone I never expected who completely supports me and wants me to reach my goals... o.o
I'm not really sure what to make of that just yet, but it can't be a bad thing. So I'm open to it ^-^

Anywhoo art has been slow, but I should be able to make up some time this next week since it's Spring Break!! whooo!!
Already??! but yeah it should be fun ^_^
I'm also hoping to catch up on the books that I had to put on hold. 2 of them I'm writing another I'm co-writing so I'm glad I finally have some down time to work on those and still have time to have some fun!!! &gt;w&lt;

well now I think I have some chores to do

Oh! the pups are both doing fine. Biggie had a few issues at the begining of the year but he's doing fine now, back in the house at nights too. ^_^ Maia is still as cute as ever and she's still a brat... basically she plays and gets excited when she wants to, not when you want her to XD

well that's all for now!
Later!"

heh....
I think I got Danny and Bri mad at me.... it was kinda my fault but not at the same time. They pissed me off and I was having a bad week... (school started this week if you didn't know) I was stressed and then reminded of something painful that I didn't want to remember and that made me sad and mad all at the same time. You know the side of me that gets locked away for the safety of everyone was starting to come out.... I could see the eyes looking at me and I felt lost with in them.

I suppose I'm being over dramatic. In any case I'm pretty sure they're mad at me because I told them I couldn't hang out tonight because I have many things to do, namely homework. But I got a very rude and seemingly annoyed text message trying to make me feel guilty and horrible. SO I think I pissed them off.
But now I don't care...if they want to be mad, then fine. I can get over this spell myself... all they do is ask if I'm mad anyways... 
I dunno...today I feel so emotional... and so alone...for no reason at all.

I hope everyone is doing well.
School has just begun again and I'm taking five classes for 14 units:D
@_@ so busy. Mondays will kill me because I have morning classes from 8am-11am and then a night class from 6:30-9-something @_@ funfunfun. Also the classes are English and Trig in the morning and Political science in the evening.
Tuesdays and Thursdays I have Architecture from 9am-12:05 and then Drama from 2:25-4:30pm
whoooooooooooooooo!! (Wednesdays I only have English and trig)

anyways I have many things to do so I better cut this short.
ja mata!"

"event","So it's been a while... don't know how long, but it's been LONG!<br />Anyways there's been new developments down here. I had to get a job...o.o... so now on the weekends I will be refereeing for the PYBL! yay me! &gt;w&lt;<br />that should be fun ^_^ I was going to work at Ralph's with Briana and Daniel (do you know about Daniel? ponders* hmmm i don't think you do) but today I decided against it. Frankly working with them would be fun and all... but I might get distracted by them and that would be bad. I also might get overloaded...or smothered by them.... which would not only be bad it would be REALLY bad.... I like my friends and I would not want to spend nights and weekends alone just because I've seen them every other day &gt;_&lt;<br />So I'm going to work for my dad again (I was laid off, but now I am rehired! yay!) and once the season starts my weekends will be filled with basketball...and possibly angry parents wanting to jump me because of one bad call &gt;.o<br /><br />Oh yeah the reason I'm writing this! I almost forgot!<br />well! it's all because of Daniel, aka Dan/ Danny. He's my new friend! XD he's a crazy boy who I know through Bri... though come to think of it I think we hang out more than Bri and I do... O_o hmm...<br />anyways. We're pretty good friends and we like to have fun and stuff. He likes to let me beat him up and I enjoy that...I also enjoy poking him...because he's extra ticklish &gt;w&lt; muwahahaha! Also Rach can attest to this, we like to wrestle or as Bri says ""wrastle"" it's nothing really...besides fun. We just try and pin each other...constantly. Though I'm at a disadvantage since he was a wrestler in high school &gt;.o but I win a few times :D I think the main reason I lose is because most of my power moves are for immobilizing my opponent... which i don't want to do to Danny since he's my friend and I could really hurt him O-O that would be bad.<br />but that's not the point of this confusion!<br />ha!<br />ok!<br />*ahem* since we are such good friends some people seem to have the idea that we may be a couple.... this is <b>not</b> true and I don't understand it!!! T_______T it wasn't so bad that Nicole (another person from Ralph's) thought we were together because umm... she's kinda umm... she's dumb...to put it nicely. So it wasn't bad and we all could ignore her (we being Danny, Bri and I)<br />however! apparently something happened and now Bri thinks there's something going on between us too!!! T__________________T<br />whyyyyyyyy???????????????????????? seriously! there's nothing going on between us! T-T<br />this whole situation is confusing and somewhat annoying.... if anyone would like to shed some light on this situation... by all means... please do.<br /><br />anywhooo... umm I think that's all. Oh! I did a photo shoot! er my own photo shoot &gt;w&lt; I made Danny, Bri and Rach help me. Though Bri weaseled out of it&nbsp; because ...well she didn't have a dress. She still helped. The entire photo shoot isn't finished yet, there are still a few scenes that need to be shot. We just lost our light and couldn't take anymore pics &gt;.o so it shall be completed...at a later time, soon hopefully :D<br /><br />well that's all for now!<br />Sorry I've been away for so long!<br /><br />ja mata!"

"event","So southern Cali is on fire again. The fire's pretty much on the same path as the 03 Cedar fire was on. But instead of diverting north to Camp Pendleton this one has jumped the freeway and has pretty much made it's way to the ocean. fun fun fun
I haven't heard from my friends yet... I know they've been evacuated and its driving me crazy that they haven't called &gt;_&lt;
I hate not being able to do anything. Seriously...if I leave this protected area that I'm in I'll be evacuated and not allowed back home.
it's a horribly helpless feeling that I absolutely hate.
I wish someone would call... or stop by. I'm sure Daniel's been evacuated to Poway somewhere since they closed the 15... I'm not sure if it's open right now... I'm just annoyed that he hasn't called. I'd call him, but he doesn't have a cell phone &gt;.&lt; stupid boy!!
Bri has been evacuated and I can't contact her because she hasn't paid her phone bill in who knows how long &gt;_&lt;

I seriously wish I had the power to calm the winds... or tame the fire... that way this would be over with and I wouldn't be worrying about everyone right now &gt;.o&nbsp; Funny how I only worry about my friends...
I mean I'm not worried about the fire at all. Its there, but I'm not worried, scared or afraid that the fire is going to even come close to my house... seriously...my house has been inside the awesome bubble of safeness...and I hope it never leaves... I just wish my friends would hurry up and get in tune with the safe bubble! &gt;.&lt;

*sigh* anyways... that's all. I just needed to rant and rave....
I have no one to talk to right now!! I can't even go outside!! I needed to rant! ex spell the couped up frustration and energy!! *flail!!!*

ok...i''m good now ^-^
thanks for listening to my rant!! :D"

"event","Biggy is my brother's dog... he's the sweetes lil big american pitbull terrier... with the cutest eyes that just scream ""love me""
We've all grown attached to that lovable dog, especially Maia and my mom. Maia and Biggy are best friends they play and wrestle all the time.
but today on his morning walk Biggy, being the playful pup he is (he really is still a puppy) he likes to jump at people...and he did just that. Well...the older lady was wearing a funny hat or something (I wasn't there) and for whatever reason he bit the lady's arm... not hard or anything; he was just playing, but the lady pulled her arm away and got a cut or gash from his teeth..... -.- my mom went into complete hysterics and apologized, smacked biggy...a lot and brought him home, while screaming and yelling on the phone to/at me....

Now we might have to give him up...we might have to give him to the Humane Society... and they might put him down... I don't want to do that, neither does my mom and I'm confident my brother doesn't want to do that either... my dad seems indifferent, but he loves biggy too.
I don't know if I could handle my brother breaking down again.... he's just starting to get back into the swing of things and Nic's anniversary just past last week...so if they take Biggy away I don't think it'll turn out good....

Anyways that's my update...since I don't really have one right now.
Oh yeah tomorrow is my dad's b-day; he'll be 52 :D

Today is Thomas's b-day, he's 11

Well that's all for now!
let's all hope/pray everything turns out good and for the better

ja mata!"

"event","the triumphant return!!! &gt;w&lt;

so I haven't been here for a looong while ^-^() gomen... I got kinda busy and forgot about it.... but! now I have some real news...so!
here goes :D

Well..I got a new car this month and it's nice, but I think I was the most unhappy person the dealership had EVER sold a car too... ^-^()
frankly I loved my lil car with the flames on it...and I was very disappointed when I was forced to part with it to ""build my credit""
anywhoo... my new car is a deep blue 2007 ford fusion. It rides nicely and I've almost gotten used to it ^-^
Maia loves it... she can look all over now...and there are some many interesting things outside ^-^

hmm... I've completed some art works and such lately *nod* you should take a look at those XD

ok...now here's the dirt.
so i go to church and i'm in the choir...or whatever you want to call it (it's not really a choir, more like a band)
I sing and play guitar (and occasionally piano)...I have an ear for music...I know when someone or something is off, out of tune,...ect.
there are 3 other women who sing with me... one is a quiet woman who mainly smiles and talks about her 99cent store
the other two are oh about 6-7 years older than me, both are married and they're best friends. everything used to be fine, we all got along and such... you know and then I got a solo...and they didn't... then my bro got a solo and they didn't. then I got another solo and they didn't... and then the problems started.
through practices and what not I make comments like ""we need to back away so everyone can hear Bo since it IS his part and he needs to be heard"" .... or ""you're a lil flat"" ...you know simple stuff that shouldn't really matter... it's not like I yell at them and tell them they suck or anything... geez. It's all constructive and I include myself so i don't step on any toes...
but no matter how hard I try one of them just has an issue with me (since the other is basically joined at the hip she just goes along with it)
her main issue is that she was in HS choir and other stuff like that... I was not. She sings very schooled like and opera-ish... I do not. I sing the way the song needs to be sung.
she's making a big deal about all of this..... though i think it all started when I was put ""above"" them in October when my parents were outta town... I got to lead and everything like that... so I think that's probably what really sparked this whole shit fest.pardon my french...but that's what it is and I'm sick of it. I don't care anymore.... damn hypocrits....
that's one thing I can't stand... what's worse is that they NEVER confront the problem... they go cry to EVERYONE else without ever talking to me... they've made such a big deal that it's actually disrupting things... earthy people are like that... they're pushovers and let people walk all over them until they decide they might have a backbone. then they shake things and cry and make a damn fuss until they get their way
well water cuts through earth and they're just going to have to deal with it because I don't care anymore... if they have issues that they can't handle then fine whatever...
I refuse to deal with it.... I'm not very nice when crap like this happens... in fact I can be a real apathetic bitch...
i'm still in ""nice"" mode...trying to give them a chance to confront me... but if things haven't changed on Thursday... 
well all hell will break lose and I don't hold back any punches.

whoo... I needed to get that out :D
yay for rants!! &gt;W&lt;

in other news! I'm doing well in soccer! I have soccer tomorrow! &gt;W&lt; I luvs the game XD
and maybe wednesday I can drag my mom out to play tennis :D

well that's all for now I suppose...I'm kinda tired as it is, even if I had a long nap today ^-^()

I was SUPPOSED to go to Canada with my friend Bri... but then her boss decided that he wasn't going to give her time off after all. the jerk.
So now we're not going to Canada....during the snow and fun....*annoyed sigh* we'll probably end up going in the spring, like in April when I have spring break. This totally sucks &gt;_&lt; I was so looking foreward to seeing my canadian friends and the snow and other things... and just being in Canada with a close friend.... but noooooooooooooooooo her boss had to be a jerk (and I'm being nice when I say jerk) *eyetwitch*

jack@$$3$ can die and people over the age of 70 can go into their own little community where they can be slow and annoying there... there are a few acceptions to the order but that's besides the point... oh yeah stupid people can go be with the old people too.

.... ok not really...
but seriously! why do the weirdos find me???? whyyyyy????
*miffmiffmiff*

anywho...umm...
ah yes...another episode of my brother is a doofus! :D
Welcome one and all! let's hear and see the latest news!
He got a tatoo...a big tattoo... with his dead friend's (Nic r.i.p.) initials and this big ol' cross with wings...and....personally I think it's stupid. I mean why plaster it on your arm?? in bright colors no less... seriously it's like pink and blue. THough I haven't confirmed it's official existance yet... but knowing how stupid my brother is...it's either real, or it won't be long.
Personally I think my dumb ass cousin is to blame. He just got a new tattoo...too...and his is some stupid tribal thing...it's huge and on the arm as well.
but whatever...I don't care... though my dad may not speak to him for quite some time when he finds out.
My dad's been against the whole ""Nic tattoo"" thing since the begining. Basically he says that if you need a tattoo to remember him, you weren't very good friends. It's harsh, but true in a sense. Also, given the history of dumb boys getting tattoo's in our family... the running has gone from lame to moronic to ""what the freaking hell is wrong with you?!""
seriously... nearly all of my male cousins that have gone out and gotten some stupid tattoo...has gone to jail... ooo yay for them, such an accomplishemnt for youuuuu. *sarcasim*
Not to say that getting a tattoo will imediately condem you to the prison life... but considering the the way things have went...well... let's just say tattoos on arms and chest... not so good idea. Though maybe a tatto on the shoulder or lower back id perfectly fine. Actaully I plan on getting a nice looking tattoo at some point... dunno what or when... but sometime.
.....
BTW if anyone ever wanted to get my brother in some serious trouble, I would be the one to talk to. Of all the family members that I have dirt on (believe me, there's a lot) my brother is the one I have the most on....*sage nod*
it's not like I snoop or anything... I have big ears (blessing and a curse) and then people generally tell me stuff on their own....
In a sense I'm like Kyoya from ""Ouran High School Host Club""... I know just about everything about everbody...I just don't say anything unless I can benifit from it.

wheee...I'm scarey &gt;w&lt;

In other news!! (that's not overly sadistic)
In january of 2007 I will be traveling to the beautiful country of....CANADA!! &gt;w&lt; where in I will hopefully get to see all of my Canadian friends &gt;w&lt; (yay!!!!) I'll be traveling with Bri-chan...and anyone else who decides they'd like to come along.
Anywhoo... more details on that to come later!

ja mata!

*bows and walks out*

PS... I got a hair cut just before thanks giving...o.o... now I look like an anime character or something &gt;w&lt; it's fun...and irritating at the same time ^_^()"

"event","Yay!! I got new Icons! themomewrath made them for me &gt;w&lt;
I loves them!! &lt;33!!

Anywhoo... thanksgiving was alright... though there was no snow and no snowboarding ...which suuuuuucks &gt;_&lt;
*siiiigh* and no down time either. I thought I'd get my hw finiushed and some drawings done... heh yeah right. It was only wishful thinking!!
Though when you go back home (erm when I go back home) it's like being a celebrity. Everyone wants to see you, everyone looks nice for you...they're always taking you out for food (I think that's the main thing we did there...eat &gt;.o )

Anywhoo we drove and that was kinda cool and kinda not, but whatever.

Umm... oh yeah!
I have started up my manga/ comic! I have about 9 pages of it finished now
and the first page can be found here www.deviantart.com/deviation/39790144/?qo=6&amp;q=by%3Asapphire-night&amp;qh=sort%3Atime+-in%3Ascraps
:D I hope you like it ^_^ (oh yeah...you read it fromright to left...because for some odd reason I can't draw cells in a left to right fashion &gt;.o i'm kinda mental that way ^-^())
Hmm.. other than that nothing too big is happening. Briana's B-day was last weekend and we're all going iceskating to celebrate on friday. ^_^
which happens to be cherprudence's b-day!! &gt;w&lt;
I'm late on sending gifts...so...umm.. they shall be late!....

I also registered for my spring classes at Mesa... since I'm not umm transfering quite yet ^-^()
I'll hopefully be taking and passing all the classes I need for my AAdegree... erm I think
I'll be taking: Fencing, General Psycology, Oceanography, Intro to fashion, Soccer, Japanese(hopefully), and 2 Aviation classes so I can get my pilot's license this summer. *nodnod*

nyaaaaaa lots of classes &gt;.&lt;
but it's my own fault...if I hadn't been such a lazy butt it wouldn't be so bad. But I was and so it is &gt;.o

Fencung is going well, though I'm, no longer at Cabrillo academy... I don't like the teachers there... they suck. And I don't deal with pompous asses. *sage nod*

I'll most likely be going to Coeur du leon... it's closer to home and I won't be wasting as much gas money...and just plain money on a place I don't want to be.... so hopefully this new place will be way better and I'll be able to accomplish at least one oif my dreams with my cousin in a few years (we both want to go to the summer Olympics...not this coming one, but the next one. I'd love to go to tyhis one, but I don't think it'll happen. ^-^())

Well... I think that's it. I have to get to work on the business website...again. X_x... I hate that thing
but apparently I'm the only one who knows how to do it &gt;_&lt; ...at least I'm getting paid, ne?

ja mata!

ok so I went out for breakfast with my mom to get her mind off of...well things. (I was going to go to fenceing, but apparently this was more importatnt) Anyways, so after breakfast we went to the theaters and saw ""Invincible"" which BTW is an awesome movie, you should go see it :D
So we come home, and it's about time to feed Maia, my puppy. So I get her food and head out to put it in her bowl, while she is right by the door waiting happily to see me and get some food. So I'm just about to put the food in her bowl when I notice a blackish grey thing near her bowl...O_O....
Imagine my surprise when I see that it, the black-ish grey thing, is a mouse... a dead mouse ...a dead mouse that wasn't there this morning...O_O
Yes ladies and gents, Maia has killed her first rodent...o.o...and presented it to us ....O_o...sometimes I wonder if my dog thinks she's a cat &gt;w&lt; but it's cool none the less.
My mom totally freaked out when she saw it...acting all freaked out like it was a live mouse or something...until she realized it was dead.

Well I have to take Maia out for a walk and then get to work on my umm...my comic! yay! I have one page completed!! &gt;w&lt; go me!!
yeah... I still have to scan it ^-^()

Also I'll be gone sat, sept 16-19th ...I'll be in Seattle....if you ask why I will ignooooore you. If things happen, which they very well might I'll let you know what the heck I was doing up there *nodnod*

Then thursday sept 21-24th I'll be in houston, texas for my friend's wedding awwwww aren't they so cuuuuuute &gt;w&lt; I just got their invite today...the crazy kids...always doing things at the last minute XP

whooo...busy week...only one day of school for me...o.o... not too good, but ok ^_^()

Anyways... that's all for now!!

Ja mata!

<div text=""my brother is a jerk"" class=""ljcut"">my brother is a jerk. <br /> He's a pain in the ass and apparently no one saw this 7 years ago...when I pointed it out.... No they decided to ignore me and caiter to his every whim and want.... apparently they missed something when his best friend clocked him in the jaw for being a pompous jack-ass. Did they think anything might be wrong with the way their son has been acting? nopes they just congratulated him for being able to take a punch and severed all connection between the other boy. <br /> Oh yeah did I fail to mention he's ""mr. perfect""? Yeah ever since he was little he's been somewhat of a child prodigy...given that he excels in everything, mainly baseball, music and sports in general. So needless to say, it's always been about him. <br /> So now that he's grown he expects the world to bend to his will as if the world revolves around him... my parents are finally starting to see that he's an arrogant jerk. for some odd reason this was a total shocker. gotta love ignorance.<br /> He MOVED out....and realized he couldn't make it on his own (oh look he's learning) and came back. and continued to believe he was king... now I could understand that he's growing up and wants to spread his wings and see the world... but my God he's a freaking moron who cares nothing about anyone! But my parents let him get away with it...I mean geez!! this is why he'll never grow up and he'll never learn anything! they keep babying him when ever something goes wrong!<br /> Well now days it's different. He's a royal pain in the ass. Besides wanting everything he deems worthy he has major attitude. My dad's totally fed up with it...my mom...well she's getting there, but I'm afraid she's gonna have some kind of break down before that happens. She just can't let go of the moron... he is her son.<br /> Me? I gave up on him a loooong time ago. he is my brother, but I just have no faith in him what-so-ever. I put up with him and try to include him and stuff...but he doesn't give a damn. I can only take so much before I explode. I slapped him before I went to Japan... it didn't do any good. but it's ont like he didn't hit me back.<br /> So seriously.... I do not care. I can't afford to care.<br /> Besides that fact he dominted the better part of my life. If I had something...like acting classes or something like that and he had baseball we went to the baseball game. Needless to say the ""star"" came first and I was always second best because I could never out do him, no matter how hard I tried. That's why I got out of sports or played things he wasn't interested in... but it wasn't like anything changed.<br /> And this is why he's the ego-maniac he is today!<br /> In anycase my brother throws tantrums like a grown up. It's creepy...and annoying. He's now on my case...since I haven't been working too much and I'm still getting paid. Well if he wasn't such a jackass he'd've at least still be getting his allowance.... it's his own fault... I tried to warn him...actually everyone tried to warn him...well everyone 'cept his friends...who are all spoiled rich kids...no offense to some of the good ones...<br /> anywho...I think i'm finished ranting now.<br /> </div>
<br />I ahve fencing tonight!! yay! &gt;w&lt;<br />I've also gotten a page finished of my new comic/manga!! yay me!!<br />hahaha!! so yes, life is good besides the stuff mentioned above *nodnod*<br /><br />well... that's all for now ^-^<br /><br />ja mata!<br />*bows and walks out*"

"event","So I've been back for a while now, but I've been taking care of my nieces. They're finally gone, we (my mom and I) drove the girls back last monday. So I'm free &gt;w&lt;<br />Ok so I was free. I now have a puppy...a cute lil beagle puppy who I bought on friday the 4th.she's 8 weeks old now her birthday is June 10th 2006. I've named her Maya (spelling may change later)<br />She's incredibly playful and jumpy...and she pounces a lot &gt;w&lt; so cute -^_______________^-<br />
<div text=""believing and stuff"" class=""ljcut"">Type your cut contents here. In other news my parents are really trying to drag me into this whole ""religion"" thing. It's annoying. Truthfully I'm not sure I believe this stuff anymore. I mean I still have my morals and such, but I don't think I believe in well a few things. I don't think I believe in heaven... I believe in hell, but not heaven. Well.. I guess I believe in heaven, but maybe not the whole we're all gonna go there someday and watch things happen.<br />I guess it's the whole rapture thing... I don't want to believe in that... at all. I mean that's all great and wonderful for all those people who just can't wait to go with God and sit up in heaven and chill.<br />Me... I don't want that. I wasn't built to sit around and chill in the clouds. I was built for war... Everyone tells me that I should just join the military if I want to be envolved in war so much. But I'm not one to take orders from brain dead people who don't even know what they're fighting for. No, I was built for a rebellion... maybe even lead a rebellion... not for some stupid military (no offense to the military) Especially since I don't take orders too well.<br /><br />I guess I just don't want to believe in this stuff, even if I know it's true. Well... I guess I'll just have to wait and find out. I don't want to just get taken to heaven and be forced to watch everything that goes on here... that would just suck.  </div>
<br />Anywhoo... umm... I'm writtingmore stories and I'm finally getting my act together on my drawings. ^_^<br /><br />Now on to the subject of love.... I'm not too sure it exists. I mean friendship love and family love, I'm sure that exists... but like love, love... the love that people talk about it books and songs... I don't think that really exists. I have yet to see it. then again it could just be me... I guess I'll just be content in staring at the shadows on the wall...instead of turning around and seeing ""the light"" I don't really see the point and I'm sort of content without it...since ...well I dunno... it's difficult to believe in something you've never experienced yourself.<br /><br />Anywhoooooooo &gt;w&lt;<br />Art!art!art!<br />Oh yeah! I finally got all my classes! &gt;w&lt; I'm taking Fencing, intro to Archaeology, Philosophy of art and music, Gymnastics, Aviation 101 and Japanese converstaion (well after I show them my japan transcripts)<br /><br />So yesh! I will be doing fun stuffs this semester!! &gt;w&lt; I think I will end up majoring in Anthropology (nodnod) makes it easier on me ^_^<br />Anyways... umm... that is all<br />*nods*<br /><br />ja mata *bows and walks off*"

"event","Hey all!
I've been home for almost a month now and I'm just starting to get a little free time to myself.
Finally. It was like culture shock all over again when I came back home!
In Japan I was in my own room, by myself in the quietness solitude of it all... when I came home there was a total of about 20 people in my house 3 of them in my room X_x it was crazy!!
after that weekend most of them left. So it was just my granpa, grandma, the small one (Gabby), and my normal family members (mom, dad, and bro). So I was p[retty busy taking them to theme parks and such. Once my grand parents left I finally got a good nights sleep (my grandma snores loud &gt;.&lt;) But in exchange I got another neice. 
So now I have to babysit 2 neices and take them places...basically I keep them entertained. *nodnod*

But I do miss Japan....a lot T-T oh Japaaaaaan T______________T 

Anywhooo
I've been thinking a lot lately. Mainly because I haven't been writting as much as I used to, especially for my stories and stuff.
I've been thinking that maybe I was meant for war...and not this peace stuff (lounging around the house ect.)... I dunno I guess I'm sort of restless at heart. I want adventure. I want to see places I've never been...I want to fight (oh yes I've been itching to see if I could really knock someone out &gt;w&lt;) I want to be envolved... though anyone who knows me knows that I could never be in the armed forced... I don't take orders very well and I'm really bad with BS. =D
Yup I'm a rebel in my own nature... but that's speaking highly of myself.
I can say though, at least I'm not an idiot... like some people I know. 
It's just all my writting are all focused around fights and wars and ....I don't know... I guess I'm weird.

In any case I've been reading these books. It's the Left Behind Series books, the kids. Focused on teens and young adults. And all the books are action packed and full of adventure...Ok realise that I believe the Rapture is going to occur...at some point (hopefully not soon, not that I could control the timing) But sometimes I pray that God just leaves me behind just so I can take part and experience everything that is going to take place. The running, the fighting, the survival adaptation.... even the persecution... the martyrs death if need be... I want all of that....
maybe I'm weird... but am I wrong to want something more? something different than this simple life here in the ""peaceful"" USA where everything isgiven and taken, without a thought of how blessed, or lucky everyonetruely is....

Is it really wrong to want to be on a life long adventure?
I'm mean life is an adventure, but .... no offense... my life is... not very adventurous.

""I want adventure in the great wide somewhere. I want it more than I can tell. And for once, it might be grand to have someone understand."" - Belle, Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast""

*sighhhh* I'm so very restless... &gt;.&lt; and my stupid parents books don't help!....for one they basically say that only guys have that ""yearning for adventure and being the hero"".....whyyyyyyy? T-T
ok so I've accepted it. I'm a weird warrior-esque girl who has a strange desire to be the hero and be adventureous like the guys.... maybe even better. &gt;w&lt;

yay for being weird &gt;W&lt;!!

yay for not being able to breathe!!....o.o... wait that's a bad thing &gt;.o

well
ja mata! &gt;w&lt;"

O've been here for 3 days now and I'm not liking it so far...
I'm so lonely and cold...and just not too happy...

my dorm room is small and cold. I don't know what I'm going to do right now... I just feel like curling up in my bed and never leaving until they come and get me to go home... that's the way I feel
like a snowball trapped in hell...

*sigh* I'll have a real update later... I just don't feel up to it right now...-.-...

I'm too far away to actually go over there ...so I called the ambulence... <br />both the medics and the fire dept showed up at his house... and he proceeded to lie to them...he said that he hadn't taken anything and that everything was peachy keen. <br />So they called me... just about the same time he IMed me and told me that he lied to them... so I told them that.... and I got them to stay there...and the cops went over to talk with him, since he's obviously been lying to them...-.- <br />and that's here it all stands right now... </lj-cut> <br />...I still don't know if he's ok <br /><br />If I lived closer to him I'd've beat down his door and talked him down...and if that didn't work I would've dragged his butt down to the hospital kicking and screaming. <br /><br />Alffie says that makes me a hero... cause I've talked 2 people out of killing themselves and called the medics for another.... <br />If loving my friends enough to do whatever it takes to help them makes me some kind of hero...than so be it... <br /><br />I've said it before...and I'll say it again... I love my dear friends with my heart and soul...I would die for them if need be... I will protect them from anything that's hurting them...even if it means protecting them from themselves... <br /><br />Love you guys *hugs...glomps and more hugs* <br /><br />...I'll update on the situation when I find out more. <br />jaa mata <br />*bows and walks out*"

"event","Ok so I haven't  been feeling so great and I hate to play off of someone's in a word ""downfall"" but what happened just really made me grin

hahahaha >W<
I hate to say I told you so...but I did!! XD
I laugh...muwahahahaa... ok...so I'll try not to be too mean *snicker*

well looks like life has a funny way of giving you a boost >w<
My brother finally switched schools and whatnot and now something's wrong and he can't try out for baseball or something XD *cracks up laughing* after all the hoops everyone jumped through to get him into RB (Rancho Bernardo) he can't even try out XD
oh the irony...
so now of course, it's everyone else's fault...it's just soooo funny >W<
the only downside is that everyone's ok with it... like ""oh well he'll be fine. he just has to learn"" a lil late to be learning this kinda crap...it seriously messes with your future... but what ever*shrug*

hehehe XD
So that's my big news for today *nodnodnod*

Also! I ahve dropped out of all my classes...most unwillingly. I had to though... the professors didn't like that I wasn't going to be present for the second half of the semester
T__________________T I really liked all my classes toooo T________________T

but oh well... I guess now I have more time to work on my manga and all my drawings ^-^
Anyways, that's the big news I had...oh!!!!
*squeee!!* >W<
I got a web cammy!!! >W<...not that anyone in the house knows about it...it's on the down low *wink*
anyways!! it's a whole lot of fun!! >W< especially now that I can talk with my friends...and to quote MD ""it's mind blowing"" >W<!!

well I gotta go
jaa mata!!

"event","<P>Ok...so i'd been doing fine for the last month or so...right? right. and then.... yesterday happened. Really long day of school... had to drop most of my classes and I'll probably end up just taking the semester off because it just doesn't seem worth it right now. </P>
<P>So I was incredibly tired since I started classes at 8am and ended at aout 5pm... So I came home really just wanting to collapse in front of my computer and talk with my friends who always have the power to lift my spirits. And wouldn't you know it...the bloody internet is down. </P>
<P>So I ask my mom what'up and apparently she KNEW it was down. Good God, woman! why didn't you do something about it when it FIRST went down??!!! So they made me call the stupid cox communications and by now I was in a mood... a very BAD mood.So I couldn't find the number and started slamming things around while looking for it. then my dad came up and yelled at me because I was slamming things. </P>
<P>Personally I had the right to be slamming things. The number wasn't where it was supposed to be, i was already tired and frusterated and the idiot operators didn't have the number. So I finally find get the phone number and the guy can't help me cause I can't move my mom's desks it's too bloody heavy. So he directsme someone else.... in Arizona... what heck?! the people in arizonacan't reallyhelp me too much now can they...seeing as I'm in CALIFORNIA....*eyetwitch* so the nice young lady gives me the CA number and then I dial and have to go through the annoying phone-number-button-push routine for the Nth time that night...and wouldn't you know it...I end up in Ohio. I mean COME ON!! how stupid is this?!! *flail* So anyways...the Ohio guy can help me...apparently and so he gets to work....ends up that they're just gonna send someone out to fix the problem.... tomorrow in the afternoon X_x *eyetwitch* So then I just handed the phone to my mom...to make sure that's ok...which is why I didn't want to handle the call in the first place... but apparently they're just too busy sleeping or watching the news to even carea bout my problems... no matter how big or small they may be. (the internet is working now...obviously) </P>
<P>So after that I kinda freaked out and broke down... I've been feeling rather worthless and incredibly neglected by my family lately....and my friends have always been able to cheer me up. Couldn't talk with my last night...the internet was down... I do REALLY stupid things when I'm angry and depressed. </P>
<P>Why am I feeling neglected and worthless? Because of my parents who apparently play favorites. I can have the best grades and have the abiliy to do what ever I want but I'll never be good enough to outshine my brother. Because he's perfect, remember? he has the most talent and he's gonna be a professional baseball player...if that is he can get his grades up. </P>
<P>So that's what this is about. I've lived in his shadow ever since I was six years old...the same time he could play baseball... ironically it's the same time I had to start wearing glasses... I've been ok with it...until now. Why? Because he did really bad with with his grades last semester...and now my parents are taking the school to court... because they didn't do anything. How come they didn't throw a fit when I had to sit the bench in Softball?I was one of the better players, so how come they didn't do anything? How come they didn't take the school to court when my couselor told me I couldn't do what I wanted to do and to pretty much give up any hope of ever doing it in the future? How come they didn't take the school to court when my Band teacher was pushing me down for not kissing his @$$ like all the other girls? </P>
<P>.....They keep telling me that I'll be great on my own and that I won't have to ride on anyone's coat tails.... but I already know that... But when they say it... it sounds like pure bull$#!+ because I don't believe them...I don't believe they care... their actions speak far louder than their words.... and I just can't believe them anymore. Blind naivete can only take someone so far... until the lies are just so blunt, that to say otherwise would be to point the finger at yourself... </P>
<P>I don't know...maybe it is my fault... but I don't really care anymore... That's why I'm so glad I'm going to Japan...I'll finally be free. They think that I'll cry and miss them and what not... but I won't shed a tear. I'll finally be free... if only for a little while... </P>
<P>~To my friends out there who read this... I love you guys with my heart and soul If anything happened to any one of you I don't know what I'd do. (er well if someone hurt you I'd go hunt them down and the beat the crap outta them, but that's for a different journal ^-^)~ </P>
<P>Jaa mata </P>

"event","Once again my brother ruins things...-.-
Ok so my dog died in december... we were going to get another one like this week for $300... another cute lil beagle puppy... and then my brother happened.

apparently he STILL doesn't know how to drive his truck and so the breaks were shot, so were the roaters (or how ever that's spelled)...so fixing his truck cost $500...goodbye puppy. He's just...such an idiot sometimes... Mr. golden-spoon-fed jerk... you get whatever you want and the rest of us suffer.... and you know what?he still gets to drive his truck! after my dad said he would be grounded andhe'd have to walk to school and stuff...or catch a ride... but nooooo.... he just drove off to the batting cages... I guess he'll pay them back in a few years.... but whatever... at least I'm working to make-up for things I use... i mean geez he does absolutely NOTHING around the house... and they just laugh it off... he's barely home.... but you know whatever... if he doesn't graduate with a 3.0 then it all comes crashing down and heaven forbid he might have to work for something for once in his life... 

so yeah... that's why I'm not too happy...
Anyways... I finally finished and uploaded my chapter picture...now I can start putting up my story...after I adjust a few things
Anyways... umm...
yeah that's it...lotsa venting

<P>I Finished all my Christmas shopping on tuesday &gt;W&lt; yay!! ahaha!! I'm finished!!! XD </P>
<P>@_@ I spent sooo much...baaaaad Mally...baaaaad</P>
<P>anyways Yesterday I went to Disney Land with Briana and pals XD </P>
<P>Lizzy was supposed to go, but something came up? (something like she had to go rock climbing with her fam and she only had like $10....er something)</P>
<P>Anyways here's a picture!</P>
<P><IMG style=""WIDTH: 417px; HEIGHT: 591px"" height=921 src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v201/FairyBug/re-life/Scan10003.jpg"" width=519></P>
<P>yaya!! the infamous splash mountain picture!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &gt;W&lt;</P>
<P>hehee ^-^ ok thas me in the front, Kristen and her bf are behind me (you don't know them *at least i don't think you do...but perhaps* and I just met them) and then Sam (but all you can see is her elbow, barely) and then there's Briana in the back &gt;w&lt; she looks so happy...contrary to the way she looked at the bottom of the drop! XD</P>
<P>Anyways we all had fun and it ""snowed"" at there &gt;W&lt; it was cool it actually looked like real snow! xD but the taste well... that's a different story XP</P>
<P>Oh yeah! we also ate lunch at Blue's Bayou... the restaurant in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. :D The was cool and fancy &gt;w&lt; and expensive!! so I ordered off the kiddie menu &gt;W&lt; spent a whole $10 bucks there &gt;w&lt; But I got us in! It was bad since they don't take walk-ins and they're normally booked 60 days in advance @_@ but I was relentless!! go me!! &gt;W&lt; They said come back in an hour, so we went on Haunted Mansion(since it was allspruced up for the holidays) and then came back. (yeah took us an hour) She said there were no opening but I bothered her &gt;W&lt; and the manager was right there and peeked her head over and asked how many we had in our party (seven) and then told me to wait a minute... she then came back and told us it would be 20 minutes!! whoo!! &gt;w&lt; I win!! &gt;W&lt; so we sat and waited and then a a few of the girls decided they were gonna shop until it was ready...and then the manager came back and said it would be 5 minutes!!!!!!!! XD awesome!! So we had to call the girls and then we went in and ate food!! XD muwahahaa!! hehehe</P>
<P>ok anyways...umm... yeah.,..we all had fun &gt;w&lt;</P>
<P>OH!!! and then on the way home we were stuck in the parking lot!!! X_x Someone!!! (who shall remain nameless.... aka the annoying know-it-all boyfriend...also the only guy in our group...with the scary eyes) didn't shut the door all the way and so the battery died!!!....@_@</P>
<P>But some nice asian guys helped us out with some jumper cables and then we were on our way home.... at 1:00am!! hehee</P>
<P>and I got a hat! &gt;W&lt; The magician's Apprentice hat with the Mickey ears &gt;W&lt;hehee So I'm happy ^-^ I also got some gifts...and stuff...and I ate 2 whole meals!!! yay me!!! I've been sick so I hadn't really eaten all week...o.o...(unless juice counts as eating)</P>
<P>Well That's pretty much it!!</P>
<P>I hope you all have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!!</P>
<P>(PS!! That's muh b-day!! New Years!!! &gt;W&lt;)</P>

<P>doing ok in japanese ...as long as I do well on my next tests and the finals I should pass...&gt;.o</P>
<P>my other classes are fine...pretty easy *nodnod* didn't get to go to gymnastics yesterday-.-... we had the day off cause of veteran's day (pfft.... veteran's don't need the day off, they're all retired anyways......i wanted to go to school...i like gym...-.- *pouts*)</P>
<P>Anywaaaays</P>
<P>I went down town with my mum to see my dad at work (since he is working in downtown San Diego at the Urban Outfitters) ....we happened to go on the night that the ""Rolling Stones"" were playing at Petco Park; so there were even more people there than usual... (aren't the Rolling stones supposed to be dead by now? i mean <EM><U>how</U></EM> old are they? O_o)&nbsp;So we're driving along and then my mom picks up her cellie phone and starts talking...which is a bad idea since my mom can barely multitask as it is...&gt;.o so after a few turn arounds (down town is full of one way streets mind you) we finally get to ""F"" street which means we're really close.... and then the traffic hits X_x So soon we're at this light, a ""yeild to turn"" light (did I mention there's a lot of those too? no? well there are and they suck) so we get the green light and now we have toyeild to pedestrians and mainly other cars before we get to turn... by this time i've gotten a pretty big head ache... when i'm cranky i get really fiesty...yeah... anyways we're still waiting to turn (there's lotsa cars) when the people behind us start honking... didn't know it was the people behind us so naturally i started looking all around to see what was going on... and&nbsp; then, of course i realizedthey were honking at us... so i glared and waves and yelled and screamed...and then we turned.... that shut 'em up XD</P>
<P>and then of course some stupid pedestrian woman had the nerve to call my mom crazy...so i yelled at her too... hehhe i was on a rampage &gt;w&lt; muwahaha...</P>
<P>it was fun &gt;W&lt;</P>
<P>todaaaaay</P>
<P>I made sushi!!! &gt;w&lt; hehee we learned how to make it in japanese class *nodnod*&nbsp; I've never had sushi before so i decided to be adventurous and make some ^-^ everyone liked it *feels special* my uncle (who has had sushi before) said it was very good, especially for my first time making it :D points for meeeee!!!!!!!!!! &gt;w&lt; </P>
<P>no i realise that i do not like sushi, neither does my brother...^-^() then again i only eat about half the stuff i make so...yeah (most of the time it's eaten before i get the chance to eat it...or i don't really like it ^-^()) anyways... i officially don't like making sushi the untraditional way... the rice sticks everythere even when you wet your hands and then sometimes it falls off...and it's just not as&nbsp;fun to make it that way... anywhoo i had fun... i made some nigiri sushi tooo &gt;W&lt; those are the ones that just have the sushi rice and a shrimp/salmon/whatver on top *nodnod* (ok I made Maki sushi and Nigiri sushi -^_____________^- ...and then i ran outta sushi rice ^-^()) hehe I also had wasabi and sweet pickled ginger on hand for everyone to try... i made it a point to tell EVERYONE to <STRONG>not</STRONG> use a lot of the wasabi, only a little bit ( i think i said that like 3-4 times to emphasize my point) well my mom&nbsp;must not have been listening and my uncle decided that since he's had all this stuff before he didn't need to listen to me... yeah...</P>
<P>my mom tooka big bite andmy uncle hand this big bob of wasabi on his maki sushi... next thingi know my dad's laughing and my mom has this look on her face ...as her entire face turns red and she officially looks like a cartoon chracter who's just about readyto have the smoke come outta their ears...so we're all laughing and then my uncle gets up and his entire head is beat red and he's trying to walk it off (oh yeah that'll work) hehehhe &gt;w&lt; it was hillarious!!! XD we couldn't stop laughing.... all i could say was"" i told you, only a little bit"" my dad was laughing and saying the same thing ""she said only use al ittle bit...like 3 times, so i figured there must be some kick to it *laugh laugh* you shoulda seen your face"" heheh &gt;w&lt; all in all it was preeeettty funny &gt;w&lt; i had fun -^_____^- I got everything set up, even set the table (i know wow...o.o) i got my pretty blue,&nbsp;japanese place mats (and the chopsticks that come with them) and i set that all up...it was prettty &gt;w&lt; hehehe anyways....</P>
<P>hmm.....yup that's what happened today!! &gt;w&lt;</P>
<P>in other news I'm pretty worried about Alffie-chan.... i haven't heard from him sincewednesday and that's really unusual since i normally hear from him everyday either on YIM or he calls... i hope he's alright.... i hope it's just some weirdo accident that he hasn't contacted me in some way... *worried sigh*</P>
<P>well that's all for now!</P>
<P>Jaa mata!!</P>

"event","Yay!! I finally got my new compy!!! whoooot!!! >W< It's fast and pretty...but I don't like the ""backspace"" button it's small and square...but that's besides the point... I no longer have evil viruses and my compy starts up immediately instead of freezing and then me having to restart it ...and then restart again only to have it freeze 2 minutes into the whole running thing...and NO MORE hijacking my dad'scompy yay!!!>W<

wheee!!! >W< lalalala ^-^ i'm soooooo happy...even though it took actual jumping through hoopsto get the pictures off my old compy.... but I finallygot them all! @_@ thank you mommy it would not have been possibble if she had not been running up and down the stairs for me ^-^

hmm.... lesseee.... i totally forget...OH yeah!!! I've been taking online traffic school...omgosh the most boring thing in the whole world...
why? because mally-chan got a speeding ticket @_@ stupid cop... he went all off on how it was probably my speedometers fault since my wheels are apparently a lil too wide for my car....and then he says ""but that's no excuse!!"" wai?!!!so...now i'm taking traffic school online so my insurance doesn't sky rocket...but it'sboring as...well you know... it's like wanting to stab your eyes out and then fall asleep... X_x...soooboring, the class in itself is enough of a reason to never speed again...of course seeing as CA highways are the way they are that's virtually impossible, but it's a nice thought process...

well that's all I have to study and stuff...and work on my art again...since all of my art work pretty much stopped once my compy freaked out (has been with out an art program for a month!!! X_x)

jaa mata!!

I went to a Thrice concert wednesday night!!!  OMGosh!!! So cool!!!!You should have been there!!! XD
The music was awesome!  they played one of my favorite sings ""Melting Point of Wax""  Under Oath was there too and they were good too, but Thrice completely stole the show, granted it is their tour, but still!!!!! muwaha!!! there was a mosh pit and everything! it was so loud!!!
but oh so much fun!! XD  I'm still all bouncy from it!! it was sooooo cool!!!! XD
and then...around 11:00pm my brother decided it was time to go home.... and we totally missed the best songs!!!  X_X We missed ""Dead Bolts"" (one of my favs!!!)AND the acoustical version of ""Stare at the Sun"" (my other other fav)  we were all pretty bummed out....-.-... but oh well it was still an awesome concert >W<  
 squeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! >W<
On Thrusday night I went to a Yellow Card Concert!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I took Laura, Lizzy's sister, with me (along with my bro and a few of his friends) ^-^ we had a blast!!! XD The only thing I didn't like is that they had to say ""the f-word"" in between every song I mean how annoying is that? X_x Were they trying to be cool? were the trying to appeal to the crowd? either way I didn't like it... and it was totally unnecessary @_@

BTW Lizzy and I are back on speaking terms, yay >w<

monday was school, tuesday was school, ...nothing to report!
Friday!!!! >w< we did bean in gymnastics!!! squee!!! I'm actually good at beam!!! *feels so special* So for my midterm I think I'll do beam and either bars or vault...since I STILL can't to a freaking backwards rools @_@ it's like one of the easiest things to do and I STILLLL can't do it X_x

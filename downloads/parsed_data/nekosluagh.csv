It came out very well, and I will put up pictures when I get a chance.  </p><p>For thouse that don't play, a conversion model is basically what it sounds like.  You take a model and convert it in to something else usually by using parts of other models or using modelling putty.  The reason to do this is that Games Workshop writes up stats for units, but never makes models for them. </p><p>I needed one of my deamon figures to be mounted on a juggernaut.

"event","I've been seeing a bunch of talking across my friends list in regards to the new list that came out from the MST's office of all the custom devotions and bloodlines that are in play.  I figured I would weigh in on the issue.

Personally, I am very happy that they put this list out.  I believe this keeps some of the checks and balances that are needed in the game.  As a rule guy, I believe there are more benefits to having a list like this than drawbacks.  

First off, as has been mentioned in other places, not having to rely on what the player prints and brings to game is a large benefit for STs, cause while I don't believe that anyone on my Flist would do this, it is not that hard to bring a document to game that is wrong and claim it to be the real thing.  I understand that if this were the sole reason for the list to exist, than it would have been fine to be in the CRD, but this isn't my only point.

Second, as I put earlier, I believe this adds another portion to the checks and balance system to keep the game fair.  Having mechanics and rules that are secret always puts a bad taste in my mouth, as when I have something used against me, I like to be able to figure out how it worked.    I don't do this to try to avoid the affect in the future, I just do it because I like to know why I am being affected in a certain way.  While I understand the want to keep stuff secret, I also think it is fair that someone can ask and be able to understand why they are affected in a certain way by something that happens to them.

Yes, people might Metagame.  You know what, they might do the same thing on bloodlines out of the book.  All I can say in regards to that is you have to be vigilant for it and make sure that it gets reported to the proper ST.  The only way to stop things like that from happening is to make sure that people that do it get dealt with.  

Anyways, that is just my .02 in regards to the issue.  I can see both side, and I understand people being upset by it, but I think the positives of this outweigh the negatives that might happen."

"event","So, as most everyone knows by now, George Carlin passed away last night of Heart Failure.  He was one of my favorite comedians of all time, mostly because he meant what he said, even in jokes.  He could entertain and at the same time make you think.  I figured that in honor of this man, I would post one of my favorite things I ever heard for him, and it directly relates back to the subject of this post.  

The routine is a long one, but the gist of the thing is about losing things.  Here is my favorite portion about where things go:
<lj-cut text = ""Carlin on losing things"">
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Where do things go when they're lost?  You know what I think?  I think there's a big pile of things somewhere. I think there's a big constantly changing pile of things that are lost.  You lose something,whoo-pop, it goes to the pile.  And then you say, 'Oh look, there it is,' whoowhoowhoowhoowhoowhooph.  Right back from the pile.  And you didn't even know there was a pile.  

      And where is the pile?  In Heaven, of course...has to be in Heaven.  
That's the first thing that happens when you get to Heaven, They give you back
everything you ever lost.  That's the whole meaning of Heaven.  You get back
everything; 'Here ya' are, 79 pairs of sunglasses, 212 cigarette lighters, 4,983
ball point pens.  Here's a jock strap we found on the Golden state freeway...it
appears to have mule hoofprints and chocolate sprinkles on it...must've been
quite an evening.'

      Yes, you get back everything...Everything, When you get to Heaven...well,
not everything, you know, you don't get the big things back.  Good judgement,
that never comes back.  Your tonsills, your appendix, they keep those for 
display purposes, virginity...you don't get that back, because you're in such a
big hurry to get rid of it in the first place.  But, you get back all your 
wallets.  You get back every wallet you ever lost...No cash...it's just like 
earth.  They keep the money as a prayer offering.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</lj-cut>

So George, I'm sure your up there.  You enjoy your sunglasses, lighters, pens...and everything else you got back when you got up there.  You will be missed down here!"

These are gods of pleasure and abandon, of wild behavior and unbridled desires. This is a card about ambitions; it is also synonymous with temptation and addiction. On the flip side, however, the card can be a warning to someone who is too restrained, someone who never allows themselves to get passionate or messy or wild - or ambitious. This, too, is a form of enslavement. As a person, the Devil can stand for a man of money or erotic power, aggressive, controlling, or just persuasive. This is not to say a bad man, but certainly a powerful man who is hard to resist. The important thing is to remember that any chain is freely worn.

"event","Avalon Hill released a new version of Diplomacy this week.&nbsp; I know that Geoff has been trying to get a gane going by e-mail, or even get together to play a game, and I am all for this.&nbsp; But I still stand by my saying that if we are playing it, we are just weeding out because we have too many friends, and apparently Avalon Hill agrees.&nbsp; The advertisement they put out in the game magazines for it had the tag line as follows:

""Ruining Friendships for Fifty Years!""

I picked up a copy yesterday by the way, so if we want to us the new version to play, let me know."

I don't play D&amp;D much anymore, but I played a lot of it when I was younger.&nbsp; D&amp;D (and RPGs in general) have always been a big part of my life and a source of lots fun days/nights for me.

2)  If you're so inclined, you check them out.  If you've already heard of them, skip to step 3.
3)  You list a band *you* like that you think is kind of similar, and hopefully a little obscure.  If you hated the band I suggested, you pick the most obscure choice you can come up with, from what you do like.  Post it in your LJ with a 'music-freak' tag.  Include instructions, any thoughts you want to include about my suggestion, and whether you're sticking with a theme or rebelling against a lousy choice.
4)  I do the same.

Like I said on Harley's LJ, Nightwish is a good match to Collide.&nbsp; I would also suggest Lacuna Coil, though not so much the last album ""Karmacode"".&nbsp; Its a good album, but I think I like most of their other albums better.&nbsp;"

"event","So I ordered a PS3 yesterday...yeah, I know...I bad mouthed it for quite a while, saying that it was overpriced and not worth the money.  But I did actually get it for 100 bucks cheaper than I would have if I went to a store an bought it.  And the bonus is that I bought a japanese one.  I have a US PS2, so if I wanna play US PS2 or 1 games, I can play them on that, and since the PS3 is region free, I won't have a problem buying US PS3 games.  All this means is that I can now go buy all of the Japanese PS2 games that I have wanted for a while, like SD Gundam G Generation Neo!!!  YAY!!!"

Dir En Grey for thouse that don't know is a Japanese band.  They were signed last year by a US label (Warcon Records) and they are doing their first headlining US tour.  I have been wanting to see them for 8 years now, so to say that I am excited is an understatement.  Anyways, just kinda rambling now.  See ya'll later. :)"

I'm on the verge of losing the two people I love the most in this world...and I don't know if I can stand it anymore.  I am so stupid...I just don't know what I want or what I should do anymore.  It seems like no matter what I do, it is going to be the wrong decision, and someone is going to hate me/themselves for what I do...I just don't want to hurt anyone else...

Maybe I should just leave...just go away, so that no one has to bother with me anymore, so that there isn't the chance for me to cause so much pain again..."

I know it wouldn't help and I would have to confront the situations I have sooner or later, but I would like to just ignore everything for one day.  It doesn't help that my body reacts badly to situations and makes me feel like complete and total shit.  My stomache feels like it is trying to implode on itself, while my head hurts, and my whole body just kind of aches.  

I'm concerned over stuff...But then, what else is new with the sluagh though...when am I ever not worried about something?  Why can't I make my brain shut up sometimes?

Well, they have made a game based around it, and apparently in the game, you either have to convert people or kill them...Now, does anyone else find this funny coming from the religious right that wants to have games like GTA and such banned from store shelves?  Below, is an article about two groups that feel that the game should be pulled from the shelves of Walmart.  I just found all of this rather entertaing.

"event","The last couple of years, I have donated some to Child's Play, the charity drive that was started by the guys from Penny-Arcade a couple of years ago.  For those of you that haven't heard about this, it is basically a charity that donates video games/toys/other things to children's hospitals around the country.  These things brighten up the kids that are stuck in these places, giving them a little bit of fun in times that aren't necessarily the best.  

Now, I know that a lot of us are hard pressed for money, especially around this time of the year.  But it is getting close to Christmas, and there are many out there much less fortunate than all of us.  If you have a little bit extra and want to donate, I have linked the website below.   There is still a few days left that they are taking contributions, and I personally feel that it is a great cause.

Nope, I'm talking about the day that we all get together to celebrate my birth...We all know how important that is...

Alright, all joking aside, my birthday is coming up on January 7th, which is a sunday.  Now, we all know that going out drinking on a sunday sucks, so it has been decided that we will celebrate on the 5th, as there is no game or anything.  We will be going for food, including sushi (which everyone else is more than welcome to eat because I wont) and more importantly, SAKI!!!!!

I am thinking that we will probably go to Ra, but if anyone has a better place to go, let me know.  All I care about is that I get my saki bombers.  

I just wanted to give everyone a chance to plan to come if they want to."

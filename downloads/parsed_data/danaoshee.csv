Putting so much dry ice in your ice bucket (to keep the water-ice frozen all day) that your polymerase solution FREEZES SOLID is bad.

This lesson brought to you by my coworker who really should know better.

On the bright side, now I don't have to stay late...:)"

"event","Parties are great. We like hosting parties.

However...anyone else that uses our house to host a party of any size should consider the following:

You must help clean up. Finding beer bottles and trash for a week afterwards is just not cool. 

If you're at our house, you should respect our things. Discovering a broken piece on the xbox afterwards? Also not ok. 


Seriously, we have a nice new house. If we let you use it like your own, take care of it like I hope you would your own."

you know i have no vacancy
and it's awfully cold outside tonight

slowly i'm rolling out of her bed
the rain stains the streets a darker black
i dress my face in stone

A lot of the time I think people online, me included, have a tendency to repeat a meme like the &quot;post this if...&quot; one, feel happy about it, and move on.<br />If we're going to have any chance of beating this, please, this time, put your money where your beliefs are. <font color=""#003366""><strong><a href=""http://www.noonprop8.com/underattack"">http://www.NoOnProp8.com/underattack</a></strong></font><strong> </strong>are collecting, and trying to buy enough airtime to have a chance of getting enough of the vote. <br />I don't usually donate, but I've done so twice on this one, because I think it's important.<br />Thank you.<br /><br />"

I would love http://www.ravenswoodleather.com/Dresses/lyndriel.html (and it would look awesome on me, I tried it on at the pirate festival)
I'm interested in both the idea of all black, or black center with gray side pieces. For grommets, I like the black. I'm a size small in their dresses.


From bravissimo.com, I'm a 32F. I'm interested in styles: 
ED04
PNB2 (in black)
PN53 (in black)
PN84 (in black or white)
I'm also interested in a cute bikini, but I'm not sure what's in stock - I should be a 32F in that as well.
In the strapless clothing, like OV24 (which is cute) I think I'd be a 32E, the last couple times I've tried the F in those they've been slightly large.
In clothes like BJ01, I'm pretty sure I'd be a 10 SC or possibly RC.
And there's lots of other cute stuff of course.

From BPAL, I could use more Fae, some Katharina, and I'm sure other things but those are the two I really need (especially katharina, my imp's almost empty.)(ordered before nov. 15 will arrive before the holidays, btw.)

I really do always appreciate book gift certificates. On more specific books, I need any Elizabeth Bear books aside from Carnival and Hammered (the only two I've bought so far.) I'm going to try to stop buying books until christmas/birthday, so I'll post more here as I think of them.

"event","So, reading my friends list, I'm feeling the need to make a plea for general respect.

When you read a news article, and there's crazy people doing crazy things like crazy people do, and the news media (being our wonderful news media) focuses on one or several subgroups that the crazy people fit into...
Consider how you'd feel if one or more of those subgroups was something you identified with, and think about whether reposting those subgroups in your post about the crazy news story (in the general line of ""look, they're this, of course they're doing this shit"") is something you really want to do. 

Every group of people has the fucking annoying idiots that most of the group thinks ""oh, god, why must they share my handle?"" 
EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.
Think about labels that apply to you, think about some of the things people that fit handily into that label do, and then think ""would I want everyone else judging me because of those idiots?""

I mean, it's your journal, do whatever the hell you want to do, but even though it's your journal, it affects the people who read it. If it's a group that you really, really, do feel that participation in that (behavior/culture/whatever) is condemnable - then do. But try not to do it accidently, or without thinking about what you're doing. We've all done it, but we could all get along better if we tried to stop.

I'm reminded of Izzard's bit about fucking weirdo transvestites vs. executive transvestites (yes, I know quoting izzard in a serious rant probably looses some sort of something, but hell, it's me):

""And transvestites get lumped into that weirdo grouping.                   
There was a guy in the Bronx when I was in New York, he was living in a cave, like you do, and he was coming out and shooting at geese, a lot of weird things going on with him. ln his cave, the police found a collection of women's shoes. They said, ""He's a transvestite."" But he's a weirdo transvestite.                   
I'm much more in the executive transvestite area. We travel the world, it's more executive.
J Edgar Hoover, what a fuckhead he was. They found out he was a transvestite and they go,
""That explains his weird behavior.""
Yeah, fucking weirdo transvestite.
Executive transvestite.
It's a wide community, more wide than you'd think.""


And, well...whatever community you're talking about, you have your fucking weirdos, and you have your normal/executive/whatever you want to call them people. Kink/faire/poly/hacker/burner/pagan/queer/trans/childfree/veg*n/homeschooler/religious/fandom/gamer/whatever... If you're not in the group, it's easy to think of them as all being fucking weirdos, but most people in any group will be fairly normal and many of them you won't have any idea they're into whatever they're into.

Similarly, damning with faint praise is worse then shutting the fuck up. See for example, the type of thing that I'm pretty sure most of my friends list would get somewhat annoyed with: ""Well, it's really not the best thing for the kids, but I've known someone raised by a couple of lesbians that turned out relatively ok, almost normal, but they have some issues with men."" 
Insert whatever you identify with.

"event","I guess it's not too surprising that everyone at my startup was too busy to notice what was happening. Half the company was in a board meeting, so their cel phones were of course off, and I was busy and away from my desk (and when I'm wearing a skirt, unfortunately that means my cel phone stays at my desk.) We're in an isolated building near the water, and from what I've noticed (more on that later) it seems to be safer near the waterfront. I did notice that the ""we've locked all the doors and turned on the alarm"" beep happened halfway through the day, rather then at 5pm like usual, but I thought that just meant our admin was sneaking out early like she sometimes does. 
The first I knew of it was when I left the building. I thought it was a bit odd that one of the scientists was in front of the building walking into the door instead of opening it with his badge, but at first I just thought he was more tired then normal (one of the groups at work spent the weekend working to make it to a milestone) and was failing at the ""put your butt near the card sensor because your badge is in your pocket and you're lazy"" thing everyone does. Then I walked out, and instead of walking in past me he lurched for my head. Fortunately he's a little slow moving at the best of times, and even more so as a zombie, so I made it to my car.
It might have been better to stay in the building, since we have a fair amount of food there, but I didn't want to try to make it back in, especially since once a zombie gets in there's pretty much no defending that place. 

The freeway wasn't much worse then normal, except that instead of a few run-over animals there were a few run-over zombies. 

I made it home ok, and met up with Almus, but there's no one else here which is worrying. Usually there's at least a couple people at my house when I get home. I didn't see any lurching on the Foster City side of the freeway, so maybe the waterfront is helping here too. If the zombies are hunting by smell, maybe the breeze off the water keeps them from knowing there's people here with tasty brains to eat? Either way, it can't last long - There was a crowd outside Chevys, and while they were probably looking for food to take, there were enough there to attract the most inept of zombie hordes. We should probably pack up and head somewhere more defensible, but I'm just not sure where. For now we've barricaded the doors, and just in case they really are hunting by smell I'm going to take a shower shortly to try to smell less like food and more like chemicals and deoderant.

At least this is one good thing about Almus's diet, he's got enough food to last him a week - I'm filling water bottles before the clean water goes out. I guess this is one good thing about our huge collection of plastic recycling, I can wash all those bottles out quickly and fill them up with water. I'm still going to need to try to raid a grocery store on our way out to wherever we end up going, though.
Does anyone else know where to go? Between me and Almus' car, we should have a full tank-worth of gas or more, so in my car we should be able to get more then 300 miles away...I just don't know where to go."

I woke up with either allergies or a cold (I'm hoping for allergies), it's going to be a tough day at work, and I got rear-ended on 101 on my way into work. 

I'm fine, my bumper's a bit beaten up, but I've got the guy's contact info.

The poor guy's an english-sounding guy from colorado, in town on a road trip, that had been driving for 16 hours.
Which really goes some way to explaining why when traffic stopped, and I stopped with it, he didn't stop in time. 
But holy shit seeing someone in your rear view and knowing they aren't going to stop in time is fucking scary. 

Other things I realized: I don't even know where my emergency blinkers are. I should probably figure that out.

My poor car doesn't even have plates yet, and it's already got damage.:(

I need to figure out where to take it for a quote, he asked me if I'd mind getting a quote before calling insurance and since it seems to be the bumper I might but I'm not sure.

ugh, today sucks, I hate dealing with car stuff.

ETA:
We're going through the insurance, after a bit of back-and-forth and a quote - he really is trying to do the right thing, he's just upset because he's the secondary insured on his friend's insurance and doesn't want to screw over his friend, so he was really trying to find a way to pay for it directly. (he offered to put down a credit card at the shop, but they don't take third party payment.)
He's got what seems to be good Progressive insurance - I've already talked to a claims guy, who says I'll get a rental car while it's in the shop which kicks ass. 

I left work really early to get a quote etc, which was good cause I wasn't doing too well. This whole getting rear-ended thing is way more traumatic then I expected. I'll be fine, but I'm a little shaky today."

Cons: 
It's freaking *tech support*.
My shift would start at 8AM. Or 7AM if I wanted that instead.
The commute is further. 
It would be a very very strict schedule - headset on at start of shift, specific lunch times, etc.
And...it's tech support.


Pros:
It would be a good line on my resume - I think.
It would get me out of the lab, mostly, and into dealing with customers/business side. 
Apparently going into things like project management is not uncommon from this job. 
It would pay about 11K more then I'm making.

"event","Having discussed the new flight restrictions (no liquid, etc) with coworkers, and discovered to my horror that several of them think that they are entirely reasonable and see no reason for the restrictions ever to be lifted, I started thinking about obvious next steps. 

In the UK, they've already gone to the obvious next step - no carryon baggage whatsoever, unless you 1. can prove that it's absolutely necessary (money, passport, glasses, the bare minimum of prescription medication that you need to survive the flight) and 2. put it in a seethrough plastic bag. While glasses are allowed, glasses cases are not.

After that, I suppose, comes the step of no baggage at all. I suggest that current luggage check-in counters be converted to shipping counters - have your baggage shipped separately from you. It may require you to stay at the airport a little longer afterwards, because of course the flights that actually carry your luggage should be randomized to prevent any ability of terrorists to plan anything - as long as it shows up within a day of your own flight, that should be fine, right?

Next, I suggest, we should address an undiscussed security threat: clothing simply provides far too many opportunities to conceal things. Airports can offer cheap disposable robes to fly in, and your clothing will follow along with your luggage on a separate flight. After all, unless you want to commit a crime, why should this be a problem? And it would make everything much safer.

This still leaves the ability to conceal things *ahem* internally, or simply the un-removable ""concealed weapon"" of a martial art. Since we've already realized that every passenger must be treated as a possible terrorist, these two problems can both be solved by simply handcuffing every passenger as they sit down. This will also add more jobs to the workforce, as more airline attendants will have to be hired to accompany all passengers to the restrooms. (Also, think of all the jobs provided by the factors retrofitting planes to have larger restrooms to allow for such accompaniment!)

Some may argue that at this point, passengers will be very unhappy during flights, especially the longer ones. Well, we have solutions for that as well! Upon seating, directly after being cuffed to your seat, flight attendants will pass out a sedative. The dose can depend on your flight, so that you only remain unconscious for the duration of your flight. 

After all, don't you want your safety?"

---

An Indiana mother recently accompanied her daughter and her
daughter's boyfriend to one of Indiana's Planned Parenthood
clinics, but they unwittingly walked into a so-called ""crisis
pregnancy center"" run by an anti-abortion group, one that shared
a parking lot with the real Planned Parenthood clinic and was
designed expressly to lure Planned Parenthood patients and
deceive them.

The group took down the girl's confidential personal information
and told her to come back for her appointment, which they said
would be in their ""other office"" (the real Planned Parenthood
office nearby). When she arrived for her appointment, not only
did the Planned Parenthood staff have no record of her, but the
police were there. The ""crisis pregnancy center"" had called
them, claiming that a minor was being forced to have an abortion
against her will.

The ""crisis pregnancy center"" staff then proceeded to wage a
campaign of intimidation and harassment over the following days,
showing up at the girl's home and calling her father's
workplace. Our clinic director reports that the girl was ""scared
to death to leave her house."" They even went to her school and
urged classmates to pressure her not to have an abortion.

The anti-choice movement is setting up these ""crisis pregnancy
centers"" across the country. Some of them have neutral-sounding
names and run ads that falsely promise the full range of
reproductive health services, but they dispense anti-choice
propaganda and intimidation instead. And according to a recent
article in The New York Times, there are currently more of these
centers in the U.S. than there are actual abortion providers.
What's more, these centers have received $60 million in
government grants. They're being funded by our tax dollars.

A bill has just been introduced in Congress to stop the
fraudulent practices of fake clinics, but it desperately needs
more support. Tell your representative to take a stand:
anti-choice extremists must not get away with this any longer!

My mom is a wonderful giving person who for most of the last year has been driving herself insane by attempting to help run a new charter school. She and the other people running it used to run the alternative classroom affiliated with the Loma Prieta school district in the SC mountains - anyone homeschooling in the Bay Area has probably at least heard of the Loma Prieta alternative study program. Unfortunately, about a year ago, the management of the school district changed hands, and the alternative classroom program was no longer able to stay affiliated with that district. 
Rather then letting it die, my mother and other people involved with the Loma Prieta program decided to try to continue the program in a slightly different format. They are now running <a href=""http://www.vistalc.org/welcome.html"">VistaLC</a> in San Jose. 
So far, like any new business, it's been a labor of love. While the teachers hired to run the classes have been paid, my mother and the other organizers have not. Their long term business model does include the organizers' salaries, but it requires a significantly higher number of enrolled kids then they currently have. 
The 2005-2006 school year is getting close to over, and as things currently stand, it's looking like they won't be able to stay open a second year. They've been having a fundraising drive for the last couple of months - donations, of course, could cover the lack of full enrollement while they find new families to join the school - but they haven't managed to raise enough money. 
To the best of my knowledge, they're about $30K and 30 enrolled students away from being able to stay open. I know no one on my friends list has the money (or children) to just go in and solve this, but if any of you know anyone in the San Jose area that has children, and is considering an alternative schooling option, please let them know that Vista is a wonderful available option that won't be around in a year if they don't find more students now.


I know my mother will be ok even if this whole thing doesn't work, and I know posting about it on here isn't likely to help anything, but it's her dream, and I think it's a great dream and wonderful resource for the local homeschooling/alternative schooling communities, and I have to try to help."

"event","Happy Holidays to everyone.:)


Mine's been good. Christmas was with my mom, almus, my brother, and my brother's girlfriend (who is really really nice, I think she's great.) It's been a really nice christmas. And I have a whole lot of new things to keep me warm.:)

The only sour note was trying to figure out what to do with the gift my father sent me - I eventually decided that I'm going to give it back to him. I refuse to let him back into my life without him giving me an apology. A new phone isn't an apology, it's a half hearted attempt at pretending he wasn't an asshole - so I can't accept it. Now I just need to decide whether I'm sending it back with or without a note. 

But overall it's been a wonderful christmas. So far everyone's really liked the gifts I got them, and I'm fairly sure that the presents I haven't given yet will also be loved, which makes me feel good."

This may not seem news-worthy, as I'm sure everyone else here can say the same thing...but I was in front of a microwave about 20 minutes and 5 seconds ago that exploded seconds after I walked away from it.
The door blew off, and the turntable's in pieces all over the floor. 
Damn 2.5% agarose gels.
From now on, apparently, we're buying pre-made gels.
No one was hurt, but those of us that were walking around where it was were very very lucky, because it just missed us. 

Now I think I'll go do pico assays in the room where things DON'T EXPLODE."

I don't normally donate to, well, anything (but then, until now I haven't had an income) - but the hurricane is bad. There won't be anywhere to go for a whole lot of people for weeks or months, and I'm fairly sure all the relief organizations will need more money than they're getting. 
So I just donated at redcross.org - you can tell them you want it to go to hurricane relief. I've also heard that all the Coinstar machines, easily accessible in most Albertson's, will allow you to send your change in as a donation, and even small donations are meaningful."

"event","Addition to earlier post:
It looks like everything should be ok, thankfully. And my bank is sending a ""Yes, we shouldn't have done that, she has money in her account, sorry about everything"" letter, which should hopefully help keep the landlord happy.

I still think that bouncing a check for being an out of order check number and being larger than normal (they also claim the signature is weird, I claim it's no weirder than normal) only 3 or 4 hours after attempting to contact me is a horrible way to run a bank. If they were that concerned, why the hell couldn't they just hold it for a day, and give me time to get back to them? Only giving me a couple of hours is just insane. 
I guess it's a result of our cel-phone culture. Everyone's expected to be in contact 24/7, unless you're a business like a bank, in which case you're allowed to expect the customer to be always available while only being available 9-5 yourself. If I'm supposed to be always on call, or else risk having important checks declined, why can't they give me a number to call so that I don't have to use time when I'm supposed to be working to deal with their mistakes? Argh. And how can they act like my being impossible to contact during normal business hours (and calling them back as soon as they open the next day) is bizarre and a cause for declining checks? I don't have a desk job. I get to sit at a computer for maybe a few minutes a day, the rest of the time I'm standing in a lab, and sometimes I don't have a phone with me because I'm working, not talking on phones. How does a policy of expecting people to always be available, not in a few hours, right *now*, make sense?

Maybe it's time to switch banks, though bank of the west has always treated me well before. Hm. Anyone have recommendations of places with free checking? I got into BotW during one of the ""free checking for the next century"" promotions, so I'd only want to switch if I found somewhere else with no fees. 

And now for refilling pipet tip boxes. Ah, the excitement."

"event","It's been a long week - but a good week.
I started work last Monday at a company that does targeted genotyping for other companies - we've got a proprietary process, and sell either process and training and hardware, or just the service. I'm in the genotyping services division. 
So far, it's very cool, although I'm terrified that I fucked up a row of samples on tuesday. (I zoned out for a second, and then suddenly realized that 1. my pipet tips were in the wrong row and 2. I wasn't sure whether I'd put them in another row first. Hopefully, I'm just being paranoid. Also hopefully, even a relatively major fuckup on my second day won't kill me.) Since then, I've been much more careful, and I'm starting to get used to it. Hopefully I'll be able to remember everything monday, since the summer intern who's been in charge of washing and scanning the chips is now gone, and it's up to me and the other new person to get through piles of chips for washing and scanning. Ack. 
So far it's a really neat company. There was a long group lunch Friday, to say goodbye to the intern, and not only did the company pay, my manager said to only write down an hour for lunch (it was a 2.5 hour lunch.) It was nice to get to socialize with everyone outside of work, it made me much more relaxed about the whole thing. (It's a startup-mentality place, everyone tries to act like they take nothing seriously at the same time as working hard.)
And I should have a desk, and possibly a computer, on monday, which would be nice. 
I get my first paycheck wednesday, since I'm going through a temp agency - weekly paychecks! And once I actually have a bunch of work to do, there will be overtime, with no need to get approval for it.:)

As of Saturday, me, Almus, Warlock, and Mike have signed the rental papers (and paid deposit) on a 4bed/2bath house in Foster City. Which will make my commute incredibly better, even if Almus' commute will become unpleasant (he found and suggested the place, I refuse to feel guilty.) I think it will be a nice place to live. The backyard has fruit trees.:) A plum tree, apple tree, pear tree, and a lime tree with grape vines growing all over it. And there's space for whatever I feel like growing - I'll definitely put in at least some mint, maybe some other veggies or something. Mint's impossible to kill, and tastes good, so I'll at least plant that. 

So it's mostly been a really good week, if scarily eventful (took two days to go from finding the house on craigslist to putting down a deposit - very sudden.) Downside of the week has been that well, I never want to start work, switch my sleep schedule by about 6 hours, and attempt to finish recovering from mono all on the same week again. The mono sore throat came back wednesday, but I've gotten rid of it again, hopefully it won't return this week. 

I think I'm in the right job. While I'm not looking forward to waking up tomorrow, or driving to South SF, I <i>am</i> looking forward to going to work. Which is a really good sign, and hopefully it will stay that way."

"event","So last nite, WAS amazing. I just had to write it down b/c I loved it so much. So we were sitting at Erins, alex said he might come get us. told us no. and then called back at like 10 30 and said they were comin to get us. So we leave and we are drviing la la la, first time I have ever been to glen ellyn, let me tell you. I was happy. Erin was pretty excited herself. we had to stop at domincks to buy orange juice for the boys. and then we went to alex's dads apartment that we had to ourselves for the night. So me erin alex brian and kyle chilled for a bit. played an intense game of bullshit, and then moved onto strip high-low?? I dont know what it was called. Me and Erin cheated hardcore with all our rings and braclets and shit. But yeah.. hmm alex lost and he was so drunk. it was hilarious. and so I just ahd to call brendan b/c we were sooooo close to him at that point in time and couldnt miss the oppertuinty. and we were like brendan come here, but he was drunk so he wouldnt walk and we were liek 15 mins away too.. so finaly brian was like alright i am okay to drive and we were like yessss! so we drove and picked up brendan.. let me  tell you CUTIE! the way he froliced in the street so we could see him.  and we go back to alexs... hes still real drunk. but it was fun. we just all sat around. and then i dont even know. me and erin and brendan laid in alexs dads bed forever. just chillen. bein cute. and then brendan kept decieding to switch rooms. we wanted to kill him. and i guess alex fell asleep sometime during this.. and so  yeah haha we made brendan look at the stars with us at 5am.. it was cute even though we could tell brendan didnt want to be out there. it was mighty cold.. and then alex woke up and we all chilled in alexs dads bed in our boxers (me and erin borrowed some of alexs.) brendan had some mighty hot spongebob ones on.. hehe we found brendans tickilish spot and it was so funny. we tickled him like no other. and then we made him sing for us.. oh cute again. and at like 6 brian left to go switch cars with his mom.. and when he came back we all got our shit together and cleaned up.. alex and brendan broke a mirror, and alex got chocoalt pudding on his carpet. but eh it was okay. so we dropped brendan off, we thought he was in  the clear.. but um he was locked out and when we picked him up at 2 he unlocked the door so he could get back in... so we dont nessicarly know what happened to brendan. but eh it was an amazing night, and me and erin pulled it off hardcore, amazing lie and everything, they thought we were at karis all nite. : ) I LOVE GLEN ELLYN BOYS (so does erin!!)"

"event","I sit in all my classes and listen to all the pretty (and okay sometimes ugly) girls around me talk about their boyfriends.. and how they are goin on spring break with them.. and yes sometimes the GREAT sex they have.. and I never have anything to add to the conversation.. I am like Oh, I hung out with Eric, Erin and Garrett this weekend. That totaly doesnt count. The only boy I talk to at school (that is actually my friend) is Tom, and we rarely talk. Its pretty shitty, I sit and doodle the pretend names of the boys I love.. just to look like I have a secret love life that no one can know about. Makes me want to vommit. I definatly hate being alone, I just want some male affection lol. I mean I dont even need that serious relationship. Okay I want it, but its not imperative. But hey, no one gets what they want, except maybe all  the boyfriended girls.. jerks. Oh well I will just sit back and wait for my boy like always.

I have learned all I know from him.. well and his friends. I miss nikki SO much.. she has been in florida.. and no she didnt come to my house to get pants and a cd before she left.. bitch.

"event","So my aunt got a picture of my cousin we havent seen since my uncle died.. its weird. I dont know, shes really pretty. Shes in 8th grade though. Looks ALOT older though. Im mad, Im still the baby damnit. Whatever though. She just pisses me off because she doesnt remember her dad, she wasnt THAT young when he died. But whatever, I understand maybe shes not gonna remember all of his family.. but shes too scared to talk to us? We are your fucking family. I dunno maybe Im overreacting b/c I knew who my uncle was and I wish she could remember him? Or maybe I just miss him and know that he would want his daughter to remember him. None the less, I think Im gonna ask my mom if I can write her or something, you know get to know my baby cousin? God that sounds weird. I was talkin to Alex about this earlier.. got a little to passionate about it. Just writing about this now makes me wanna cry. I feel so bad because I didnt get enough time to know my uncle like I should have.. everyone saw how much Amanda (his daughter) looks like him and they all started crying.. I sucked it up, I dont like crying in front of my family. But I def. cried after I talked to Alex.. oh well Im not scared to say it. I miss my family.. as in the ones who are no longer with us.

English was real boring, but me and Zacky made friends. Hes a good kid. I then made him take me to Communications.. its ok though because was going too. It was soooo boring longest block ever, I swear! She told us about Microsoft Word for about 30 mins, actyint like we were all mentally retarded.. but its ok Me, Amy, Mike and Brett just pointed out all the sexual refrences in her lecture.. we were being so immature. Oh well thats what she gets. Brett showed us how he can flick people off with his middle toe, quite cool I must say. But ya.. Flex was fun I guess? not as good as yesterdays.. Oh lord! I swear my Spanish teacher is crazy! Like I dont even understand! 

Gym- OH BOY! Ms. Ledford is obbssed with Harry Potter, alot of our gym expierence is based on Harry.. weird. It is going to be the most unconventional gym class Ive ever been in. But its ok. Me and Katee like laughed the whole time, we strayed from the group and got yelled at. We made our old middle school chants.. I had to do the Cardunal.. and made some weird ass sound for no reason. But Katee and some Zach kid found it amusing? Then me and Katee decied we didnt have ne one to sit with so we sat in the 'B' in Jacobs on the gym floor. B for cool that is. Then Nick came to join us.. his hair was straight today.. so cute. But ya.. so the bell was about to ring.. and the damn firealarm goes off. Stupid jerks! We got back in the school at 3.. and I had to go lal the way upstairs. GAH! But its ok.. so I walked to the car alone again! And guess who was there to hit on me on the way teher? YA the nasty senior guys. (today I had a pink shirt on that said Fresh Peaches or soemting Always tasty! YOu pick em.. and it had two peaches one on each boob area) So im walking an dthey are like Oh i want some peaches! GIrl are you walking home? and then the one guy says the other, She must walk home, how do you think she got those legs? I wanted to cry and run. So I just sped up my pace. They aer soo nasty. but its ok. BYE BYE (haha I bet the only one to read this will be Nikki, if she even does lol)

Tonight we were supposed to go see Fall Out Boy at Hollister.. but its being soo gay. So I think now our only option is sitting outside the store and listening. Maybe trying to get in. But hey its still Fall Out boy. 

I cant belive this is the last night of summer.. it sucks SO bad. I want to like cry. I dont want it to end like this- no one is getting along and I feel like im stuck between two groups of friends. So whatever. My last night Im pretty sure Im spending it w/ Erin Nikki and Sam. Everyone else is going to some party- whatever. I dont care. Fall Out Boy is hotter. 

I am so scared to go to school. UGH! Im gonna be so lost and confused. Whatever I think people need to get along! I dont want to leave Eric and Nikki- they make me smile sooooo much! I hate this.

Oh so last nite guess what me and erin and dustin jammed to in the car? Ya Justin Timberlake thats right! and no it wasnt even my CD it was Dustins.. that scares me a tad bit.

There were soo many funny drunk people dancing in the isles! We laughed SO hard. We got some looks from old drunk men when we were dancing- but its ok. Ha some semi hot younger drunk people gave us high fives and some WHOOOS! We ended up sitting next to two old ladys that didnt like me and erin all that much. Maybe beacause we were screamers. Haha. With all the down time before the concert (2 hours!) We watched all the people in their crazy outfits.. and talked about our outfits for Kenny Chesney.. which is in 2 weeks! AH! There were sooo many fat men walking around with their beer bellys hanging out. Haha. We got really exitced when he said he had a special guest (we thought it might be kenny) but it was just Martina McBride. Erin rapidly called for the candy man like 9 times. It was pure funnyness. After -Pencil Thin Mustache- ended we got a HUGE whif of weed. It was delightfully funny.

When the volcanoe song came on Im not gonna lie- I almost cried. The whole like atmosphere reminded me of my uncle. I miss him. He was like the best guy ever. My mom told me a story about him dancing with Jamacian women and I laughed but I really wanted to cry. Its said. I feel so like privledged to be at one of his concerts. (OK enough sad shit!)

Hahahah! When we were dancing some man came up to us and he was like ""Dont start partying too soon now."" Ya we def. stopped dancing for a while. Some black man stared at us and it was scary. Haha that remindes me of the crazy black guy on drums. He was fantastic. Hah.

AH! When we were leaving we were dancing b/c he was playin  the end of his encore. And some shirtless man came up behinde us and said ""Cute as a button"" scaring the shit outta us. Lets just say we held hands for a while after that. 

OHHH! We saw a real cute boy coming down the stairs on the way out. I wanted to lick him. Erin wanted to jump in the pond. LOL

I now have more hair products in my bathroom than I have ever owned. His blow dryer is better than mine. WHAT IS THIS! I dont understand.AND my bathroom smells like total man! Its hard living with a metrosexual.. It makes you feel like less of a girl. Compared to him Im a tom-boy. Its horrible!

Im getting a 900ft wide water bed. its gonna be fun! and Erin shes crazy and wants alot of shit. I asked Brendan to come visit us down there. and I think he was alittle offened that I didnt pick him. But hes just TOO hot. But I guess I've changed my mind? Me him and the black kid can always share. But ANWAYS!

I get lectured by my Dad about how I dont apperciate things and how I have no idea how hard it is to have my mom come and get me in Algonquin ever night when she has work in the morning. Oh ya, and how I should find some ""local"" friends. Oh okay, cause SO many people live in Gilberts. And I oh SO want friends that dont go to my school (I have my fair share thah Im gonna miss already!) And somehow I got in trouble for not knowing where Erin was and not knowing when she comes back to town? Explain that for me.

Ugh, I cant (OH FUN! I just had to go do the dishes! Anything else?) but back to what I was saying. I cant wait for my brother to come home. Atleast maybe he wont bitch at me alllll day long!

I miss him more than you will ever know. I still have no boys worthwhile in my life, and its shitty. I got my homecoming dress today- its cute i guess, not what i wanted. but it will do. Ya im really jumping aroujd in this entry. I just got back from two vacations, Las Vegas and Wisconsin- both sorta fun I guess? School starts soon. I dont know what Im gonna do- probally crawl in a corner and do nothing. Im gonna miss Eric, Nikki and all of them SO much, I hate it. I wanna rewind time and walk back thru DMS's doors and be little again. Go to Mr. Hornbergs 1st hour history and left the laughing begin. It sucks- Eric was in all of my classes- 2 years. and Now hes just gonna be gone, I dont know I mean who am I gonna jazzersize with? But its time to grow up- OH well!

Anyways- I like this boy so much. More than ever. And I would never tell anyone who it is, because it would just be a let down- I kind of enjoy having a HUGE secret. Even though I lie and say I like no one at all. Opps- secrets out kids! 

Homecoming is in like 4 weeks- Im def. gonna end up going stag but I guess I dont care, Ill make the best of it.

Summer kind of sucked- I miss alot of people and I hate it that they dont even remember my phone number- its only been a few months. ASSHOLE! phew!

Ok well I guess thats it- lets cap off summer right and go into Jacobs best friends :)"

ok so Couch Tour... 
totaly sucked but we did talk to some cool people. like that bad from like missouri or something Blue Eyes Burn Thru?? i dunno haha but we gave them money because they were stuck here. one of the guys was pretty damn cute. haha and then we met some guy who was standing on his car and jenni and erin got up there w/ him he was funny. i dunno me and nikki loved it when he stradled his car? we are gay. i spent alot of the day it seemed like w/ tom and nikki? weird i know. but whatever. CKY was gay and I saw Bam but it didnt impress me.

Bonfire at Taylors...
not much to say- pretty gay. michael was there, ya that kid has changed since like last summer. hes a poop head now.

Today/Tonite at Jens...
Me and Erin went to jens today and we swam and shit. and then eric came over and we swam some more. and i did a major back flop b/c i was tryin to do a flip. and then we played some gay game on a raft like we were 5 years old but it was cool. and then Eric wanted to cook for us... so he did...uh poor mans lobster, puppy chow, and chicken i think.. man all we did was eat today.. 
eric smacked my ass w/ a wooden spoon and i have a welt- it was pretty damn painful. 
nikki came over at like 8? no clue. and we just all chilled a little bit and at 9 we all snuggled up in Jens bed (minus jen) and watched Newlyweds b/c we are gay like that. but ya Nikki informed that Alex told her i was gay.. which makes me sad b/c i idolize that kid and i thought we were friends? i dont know. i give up on those boys. 
then we sat by the bonfire well i only did for like 20 mins b/c my mommy came and i had to go home. oh well i didnt feel so hot.

well this is a long update and im sure no one will read it.. so yeah. but now im gonna go read again b/c im a loser and what not. 

(just to let ya know- i have no idea what apathetic means, but i just wanted to see the smiley face... loser i know)"

"event","SO last night was pretty damn interesting..if you can call it that...


to start it off we went to cats house.. ya that was normal...and then we went to  the gigeles and hung out w/ the norm. and then ya. we just went home.

About uhh i dunno 1 these weird guys call brittany and ask if we wanna go to a bon fire.. of course kari and brittany wanna go, they know who these men are. and they tell me oh dont worry they are really nice and hott. so we go.. uh first of all as soon as me and brittany got in the car we wanted to go home. they were SO weird. We for sure thought we were gonna get raped. SO we get to raceway and we have to park across the street in lincolnwood...and we see guys walking.. guess who it is! JOE MARTINEZ!! and i like ran over to him and i wa slike ohhh god i dont want go but i had to i had some weird brian kid all like ""ellie baby cmon!"" so ya we went walked up in the woods in fricken pitch black for 10 minutes, up hill. and it was horrible then we get to this little place. and its a bunch of weird ass guys.. lets just say me and brittany stuck together. everyone was drinkin or whatever but me and brittany stayed sober, didnt wanna do something we would regret in the morning. there were like 2 funny kids there- stewy and charlie.. and i felt safe w/ them there haha even though stewy def. had a hacet and was tellin us if he got mad he was gonna chop us all up.. but he was good w/ people? haha but ne ways. they were just funny as hell.. lets get some comments in here hahahhaha

""Brian, just dont worry about it."" -no one knows what charlie was talkin about.
""In Columbia your like hey can i buy a gram and they are like no no just take his handful.""- haha charly again.
""Hey Brittany can you do a back flip?""- What random stewy.
""Dennys cmon good food good times. how can you go wrong?""- Charly made a good effort tryin to get us to go to Dennys.
""I hate boneless chicken wings.""- random thought my stewy.

Ok so we are supposed to get a ride home from Chris who is drunk.. NO WAY! so me and brittany leave w/ this guy Matt who hadnt drank or anything tonite (yeah we left kari!!) oh ya stewy came too. we had no flashlight on the way down- but its ok. haha stewy was walking behinde me at one point and he turned on his music and i turned around and hes like ""it helps...w/ the noises in the woods.""

So we get back to karis w/out kari and we feel like total parents we are freaking out tryin to find out when shes coming home.

Lets just say she came home- fell asleep and did some major drunk sleep talk.. me and brittany almost peed our pants."

So this girl Jesica told Nick that me and erin looked like skanks last nite.. cause we had skirts on. oh sorry thats a crime. fucking bitch.. Last nite i stayed at erins, and we layed outside in the grass and looked at the stars and it was real pretty. we talked to jeff tom and andrew, wow what a list.. Then the clouds covered the stars, which was kinda cool cause we watched em slowly drift in. but ya then we went back inside. Me and Erin ate popsicles last nite, just for the jokes.. and no one laughed at me besides Tom.. hes such a good kid. and then we found some pokemon cards, counted em (350 or something) and then we sorted em..that was a trip haha. but ya, the girls are back from camp now.. maybe next week will be better..."

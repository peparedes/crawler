Trent Reznor, truly, is a musical genius <br /><br /><br />You Are Loved (Don't Give Up) <br />by Josh Groban. Sometimes the ones that leave the most impact are the simplest. <br /><br /><br />Theme for the Blood and the Life Eternal<br />by Neverending White Lights. This song gives me chills, flashbacks, tears, everything. It's a truly amazing song. <br /><br />One Man Drinking Games<br />by Mayday Parade. <br /><br />The Messenger <br />Release<br />by The Tea Party. <br /><br />Snuff<br />by Slipknot. There is, literally, no better breakup song. <br /><br />Because I Can<br />by Katy Rose. <br /><br /><br />Each of these songs demands a different emotional reaction from me. They are beautiful, heartbreaking, and heartwarming. <br />Give them a listen. =)<br /><br /></span>"

(With an exception, obviously.)<br />I value her friendship like no other, and I trusted her implicitly. <br />So I don't understand why she would go against everything that comes from her mouth to hurt me the way she has. I know it was never the intention.<br />But then what <em>were</em> the intentions?<br />Date the person I wanted and be happy with me never knowing? Was I supposed to jump for joy and hold you in all your glowing contentment? Was this even thought through? <br />Did you even ask whether I would do this to you? <br />No, you didn't, because you know the fucking answer. <br />You betrayed me like I was someone you never even cared for. This is something you do to a petty stranger, not your best friend. Friends. <br />And now it's like she doesn't even care anymore. Like she is just too willing to give up and lose me. <br />Lose me. <br />What happened to never letting that happen? What the fucking hell happened?<br />What happened to fighting? What happened to a meaningful apology and NOT playing the victim in this?<br />Because you, my love, most definitely are not.<br /><strong>This </strong>is a consequence of what you did not think through, and I'm not going to apologize for it. I have no reason to. <br />It's going to take so long to heal<em>&nbsp;completely </em>from this state you have put me in. <br />You fucking shattered any trust I had in anyone anymore, because I promised myself you would never hurt me. <br />You of all people. I expected it from him. But not you. <br />Never you. Never.&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't trust anyone. I won't let ANYONE in. I don't tell anyone anything and I can feel this bitterness in me just suffocating. <br />Do you know how many fucking tears I've shed over this? Red and clear?<br />Do you fucking know how many fucking scars this has inflicted? Emotional and physical? <br />The fucking expectations both of you held over my head like a bone to a dog? <br />JUST GET OVER IT KAYTI, SO WE CAN BE HAPPY. <br /><br />I don't think you do. <br /><br />But I digress. <br />I am&nbsp; bigger person than to let such a fickle situation rule my life.<br />And I fucking refuse to let such a selfish asshole control my heart.<br />So I've taken the biggest step I wasn't ready to take - I fucking jumped it.<br />I'm over him. Of course I love him, but I am not <em>in love </em>with him. <br />I will never be again, ever. It's a good thing, and a huge weight lifted from my chest. I'm over holding a resentment towards this, because it's not doing anything constructive for me. I only need to tend to my wounds, and heal myself, FOR myself. <br />And that will simply lead the rest to pass.<br />My anger will dissipate, and slowly dull to nothing. I will never shed another fucking tear over this. <br />I don't fucking deserve it.<br />Just know, bb, you will never hurt me again.<br />Ever.<br /><br /><br /><br />I hope our friendship can mend itself, now. Before it dies.<br /> Because I do love you, and I truly do not know what would happen to me were I to lose you.<br />I&nbsp;don't ever want you to leave my life. Either of you, really. You've both helped me through life's&nbsp;most painful shits.&nbsp;<br />But you've hurt me too, and as much as you need to live with that, as do I. </span>"

where&nbsp;nightmares reflect against the dark,
from which I cannot hide.&nbsp;
And sleepless nights are restless, always fighting for attention --
bruising me with purple crease; a beacon to&nbsp;the world,&nbsp;
wailing:&nbsp;""I'm broken, I'm broken!""&nbsp;

I walk amongst the living, to hide the gash that
ever-so-neatly bleeds from within,&nbsp;
leaving me pale and drawn and empty, a corpse,
unfit to step where I do.

I breathe to hold my breath in waiting,
and though my lungs scream and claw, not only for oxygen,
but happiness and life and love,
I sit, a shell of who I once was, listless.
Watching the moments pass by until I dance with angels of lost causes.
Hoping, dreaming and waiting.
Always waiting.
For you."

"event","I am <em>so </em>hungover right now goddamn.&nbsp;<br />Anyways. My night was so interesting.<br />I loved it.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />So, we went to Rhonda's moms and we hung out there for a while. I spent most of my time in the shop with the adults because the kids are little shits. It was fun in there. Except when my mom would be like, ""Get out, Everret is going do smoke weed."" I was going to say, ""You think <em>I</em> never have?""&nbsp;<br />But no.<br />That would have ensued much trouble.<br /><br />So, blah. But whatever. My mother is still super cool. She let me drink wine (a glass) and gave me butterscotch rum (SO GOOD) and I had this mudslide thinger (wow the affects from that thing) and then I had a sip of Kalua. hmm, yummy.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was only slightly buzzed when they decided they [the adults] were going to go to a club. Obviously, if not unfortunately, I couldn't go, so Shirley drove me home. But before I left, I stole Rhonda's vodka. The thing was fucking full. TEEHEE. <br /><br />So, I got in the house and changed. Turned all the lights on and yeah. I called my friend Alex (new friend) and he came over with beer. BAWHAHA. So, ontop of everything I had at Rhonda's, I had almost a whole thing of Vodka to myself, and five beers. I have never been so drunk in my life. It was hilarious. Alex said I was funny. Good to know?<br />So, he went home and I was bored and decided to pick up the phone.<br /><br />I feel sorry for all the people I phoned.<br />I tried phoning Jen a billion times and left hideous drunken messages on her machine. I am NOT looking foreward to when she finds them.<br />Then I tried to phone Ginnie because, well, she's great, and no one answered.&nbsp;<br /><em><br />THEN I PHONED&nbsp;<div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://cloen.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://cloen.livejournal.com/""><b>cloen</b></a></div> DEARESTS HOUSE AND HER FATHER ANSWERED AND SAID, ""ONE SECOND."" AND THEN I WAS ON DRUNKEN HOLD FOR LIKE, FIVE MINUTES AND THEN HE HUNG UP ON ME. HMPH.&nbsp;<br /></em>Then, I phoned Edan. And she answered. By now it was like, 2 am. We established, on this phone call, that she is a lesbian, I was drunk, it was very late and I was sorry for waking her. Then I hung up and have not talked to her since. <em>IM SORRY EDAN.<br /><br /></em>Anyways. Then, I hear a knock at the door and all that went through my head was ""FUCKING SHIT I AM GONNA GET CAUGHT SHITFACED AND DIE.""&nbsp;<br />So, I ran around, turned off the TV (which, to me unknowingly, was playing PORN. WTF.), ran and hid the vodka, and then stumbled to let my mom and dave in.&nbsp;<br />I went into my room, and then came the word vomit. It was a monstrosity.<br /><br />I called my mom (who was SO DRUNK) in and she crawled into my room (possibly the most hilarious expierience of my life) and was on my floor laughing hysterically. So I told her I was drunk and she was like, ""Oh dear HAHAHA."" And then I crawled onto the floor with her and somehow (I think, I seriously cannot remember how this occured) scraped my knee.&nbsp;<br />A bunch more of hilariousity ensued, like me telling them not to have wild crazy monkey sex because, yes, I could hear them and it was traumatizing and me and my mom discussing how to make the perfect get away after robbing a bank.<br /><br />Then came the <em>real</em> vomit. I ran to the bathroom and barfed like, three times.<br />And once this morning.<br />Jesus.&nbsp;<br />And now I have the worst hangover of my life.&nbsp;<br /><br />But my mom hasn't gotten mad at me. At all. It's so great."

It would just..simply be the first thing that would arise for me to do.

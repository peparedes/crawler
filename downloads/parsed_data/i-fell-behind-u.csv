"event","Tonight I watched a man die. He cried until his eyes glazed over and all the color had left them a shade of gray. I felt sorry for his family and all the ones that cared for him the most. I also felt sorry for the ones that took for granted day after day the advantage of being able to see him and communicate with him. I felt sorry for not getting to know him. He was someone's father, son, and lover. They never got to say the last goodbye, so what made me so special? I'm a nobody just looking for answers to my own problems. What made this strike me in such a way? All my problems seemed to have disappeared after that. I continued my ride home and all I can remember is seeing his final breath, and the look on his dying face. His soul left his body and it was clear at that point he wasn't coming back. Paramedics rushed to the scene and fire engines and police cars surrounded everyone's view. It wasn't something to be seen. After they were done the paramedics asked me what I saw and if he had any final words. ""Yes"", I replied with a trembling voice. ""He said..."". I don't know why I took the long pause to answer, but then I remembered the man's face. I remembered his final breath. As he spoke his final words, he looked at me and said ""It's all make believe. You can wake up now."""

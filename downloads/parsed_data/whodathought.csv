"event","the last couple of months ive had a chance to experience only a few highs but not enough to compensate for the many lows ive felt..especially of late.. the dynamic of my life has changed greatly..and i dont know what to do.. how to handle it with as minimum hurt as possible.. no one said life was going to be easy.. and im not expecting it to be.. just wish my life was more eventful

on a side note.. im still lonely .. and it's not like i havent tried either.. it's just that it's more apparent now that the world is superficial .. all you people can say youre not and convince yourself as much as you want that youre not superficial and look for whats deep down inside... but youre just living one big LIE .. do me a favor and just admit it 

and you might think.. oh why does brian focus so much on obtaining a relationship or wanting to be in one .. or why does he overlook the other things in his life that might make him happy .. i say this to you .. WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK IS TRIVIAL MIGHT JUST BE IMPORTANT TO ME.. AND IF YOU THINK MY PRIORITIES ARE WRONG .. I COULD CARE LESS .. because unless youve been in my situation .. WHICH YOU MOST LIKELY HAVENT.. then you dont have a right to comment on anything 

so let me be depressed and sad .. because if you didnt notice before and had to read my journal entry to find out .. then maybe pay more attention"

"event","aight so from the last couple of entries you can see that i was all hyper n shiet.. well can i just tell you.. it was seriously the alcohol talking.. i admit it.. the past weekend i used alcohol to make myself feel better so i wouldnt have to remember any of the shiet i was going through before.. but once i sobered up all of it was back again.. and it came back more than ever.. and the last two nights.. i have cried more than i have ever before.. WHY?!?.. i dont know why.. i think ive just been feeling LET DOWN by certain people.. i guess after that party on saturday.. it just made me realize things about myself and about the people that i associate myself with.. and i just got really depressed especially on the ride home from that party.. and it continued on into sunday.. so what did i do .. i just ended up drinking again by myself.. had some leftover vodka.. took about 6 shots of that and i was okay again.. my dependence on alcohol has taken a new form.. but yeah.. i talked to my sister michelle.. cause i needed to vent to someone.. and did i vent.. i told her all this stuff about someone.. so she knows wassup.. but after i got off the phone with her.. she sent me this thing about her personal experience about what happened up north.. and i seriously just started crying for the longest time..

i guess reading her experience made me feel worse about my situation.. she was able to feel better about her situation and im so happy for her that she got to experience what she did.. and i guess in a way i just want the same thing for myself.. especially the whole self-confidence issue and how i dont have any.. how feel like i look like shiet on the outside and people see that.. cant really change the way i look.. and how i cant help but feel thats the reason why i cant get someone.. why i cant find myself in a relationship.. why im so alone.. 

(i know what SOME of you are gonna say.. that being in a relationship shouldnt be my focus.. and blah blah blah.. BUT I THROW THIS BACK AT YOU.. how can you say anything if youre happily involved with someone.. why cant i be happy too)

so yeah.. i was feelin like shiet that night.. so i was talking to my friend.. and i seriously wanted to talk it out with someone in person and not just online or on the phone.. so we were supposedly gonna chill on monday but that didnt happen.. no call or anything.. I FELT SO LET DOWN.. so last night.. i just cried while lying in my bed .. i was just crying cause i felt so overwhelmed by all these emotions going through my head.. and i just got so sad cause of how my situation isnt really improving.. so i just started crying and decided to pray.. and in my prayers i was asking God WHY???.. what could i have possibly done to deserve all this?.. and just questioning all the things that i felt were not going my way..

of course no answer.. but it just felt a lil better to let it out.. so it's tuesday now.. and i still feel the same way.. havent let it all out yet.. still need to get what's off my mind to this someone.. but that will come in time i guess.."

"event","well it's been day 5 of me being home alone.. although i do like the whole thing with the 'rents being gone.. it does take a toll on you.. my mind is so consumed with all these thoughts and i think im causing myself to be depressed.. when youre all home alone you have so much time to yourself a whole house to yourself that things get quiet.. and you just get all wrapped up in things that go through your head.. thats what im going through now.. how will i survive?.. i dont know.. but seriously i am startin to get lonely.. not just cause im alone but cause of other things.. i guess i just gotta keep myself motivated or something.. who knows what will come up.. i just finished watching sHrEk.. interesting movie.. anyways.. for more gossip about my craptacular life just tune in at another time.. cause im not feeling very creative at the moment.. peace out"

"event","so i survived valentine's day.. but maybe i was just putting up a front that everything was okay.. as i sit here listening to people talk about how their's went and how their all happy with whatever involvment they have with whoever.. i cant help but wonder why cant i experience the same thing myself.. and it got me thinking.. you know when youre a lil kid.. you have this grand vision of what you think your life will be like when you grow up.. well when i was a lil kid i always imagined that i wouldnt have to deal with this problem of relationships.. i always thought id be happy with someone by at least my age (20) and that things in my life would be all right.. even though at a young age my ideas of life were immature and naive.. i didnt think things would be this bad.. i mean come on.. ive never been in a relationship before and although i have felt feelings for people .. my feelings were never returned.. do you know how that feels??.. people can say they know the feeling of rejection but to have to feel it constantly like some vicious never ending cycle .. it takes a toll on you.. i guess it's just one of those nights.. but then again.. seems like ive been having those nights every night for a long time.. and i just want to be happy in all aspects of my life"

"event","well i havent updated this shit in a while cause ive been stressin.. i had midterms for the last couple of days and dayam ive never spent that much time studying and being serious.. well im done now.. and over the course of this time.. not only was my head bursting with facts and formulas but i had to deal with a lot of issues concerning myself and friends and/or both.. i guess a lot of it has to do with valentines day coming up.. and yeah.. whatever.. you can be all like valentines day BLaH bLaH bLaH.. well im done with midterms so i can bitch about it now

so anyways.. first of all.. i dont really like the concept of valentines day with it being all commercialized.. and other people say just let the lovers have their day.. but then i say i wanna have my day too.. but anyways.. every year it's always been depressing and just disappointing.. and this year is no exception..okay so theres this guy that ive been talking to for a while now.. and he's dope for someones thats only 18.. like we have cool conversations that cover about anything.. and he's just dope.. and every now and then he would be like.. okay good night babe.. ish like that.. so what am i supposed to think yanno.. you just dont call anyone that.. so i was starting to think that he was into me and i was into him and it was just going well.. so a couple days ago when i was stressin and needed some relief, attention, and a break from the craziness.. so i ended up talking to this guy.. and with me being all sly about it.. i casually asked.. so what are you doing this friday.. (SMOOD HUH!!).. and it took him a while to figure out what i was talking about.. so he said.. brian are you asking me to be your valentine.. so i said.. ******* will you be my valentine.. and he straight up said... NO.. (thats fucked up huh!!)but i calmly asked why.. and he said cause he's seeing someone that he used to see in the past.. i was all disappointed.. cause i thought i was actually getting somewhere.. but i guess i should get used to such disappointment

and i guess all this disappointment stems from the fact that im bitter.. well not bitter.. but jealous.. okay both.. like when i see my bestest buddy.. he seems pretty content and happy with this guy that he's talking to.. although the way they go at it they might as well just get together already.. haha.. THERE I SAID IT JEM.. but anyways.. like i was telling him the other day.. it's just hard for me seeing other people all happy in relationships and stuff cause i havent been in one before.. and though people say that relationships arent always what theyre cracked up to be.. and that i shouldnt focus on it so much.. but seriously.. the people that are saying that have been in a relationship or are in one in the process of getting into one.. theyve had the experience.. but what they dont know is what it feels like to be constantly rejected.. you guys reading this probably dont even know what it's like for me to constantly just get rejected.. the amount of feelings ive invested in the past doesnt even compare.. and it's not like i get caught up or anything.. there have just been cases where i thought i was getting a vibe or a sign that things were finally going to change and i was gonna get to start something with someone.. but in every instance it never went my way.. and i know JEREMY that you mean well when you say that i shouldnt focus on it and that i have so many other things going for me.. and i know youre right.. but seriously .. you of all people know how hurt ive been in the past with all this relationship stuff.. and you and everyone else just keeps on saying you just gotta wait and wait.. . but i dont think i can do all this waiting along with all the rejection as well .. it's too much on my self esteem which is practically down to nothing.. and it's just too hard.. yeah .. thats only a part of what's been going through my head.. i better stop before i start crying or something.. so ill end it with this .. .

"event","okay we'll pass with the bs and do the usual.. i went to school.. studied..chilled with jem.. ate at albertos.. went to starbucks..studied again.. went to practice.. got home.. studied again.. well sort of.. so that was my day for all you inquiring minds that usually want the jist of a person's day..so with that said n done.. lets get to what's been buggin me.. it's this whole idea of IMAGE.. or what people perceive to be an acceptable image.. it's always been on my mind.. but more now than ever for some reason.. theres always that self conscious part of myself (and im really really self conscious) that makes me question whether if i even look good to people.. i think to myself.. if i saw myself walking along would i look twice n think heeeeeeeey.. i always come up with the same answer .. NO!! .. yeah past experiences have made my self esteem pretty dayam low that it aint even funny.. and then when i think someone is interested and makes my self esteem go up just a lil something always happens and then im back where i started at.. usually when that happens either i was stupid into thinkin that person was interested or just got caught up with things was blinded from the truth.. in either case .. it leads to the same conclusion.. so this brings me up to another thing i was thinking.. and it's like how do people get jocked.. not that isnt such an important issue.. but when it doesnt happen to you .. you tend to dwell on it and just wonder.. is it their personality??.. not really cause you cant tell a person's personality just by looking at them for the first time.. and a lot of people say they like people with a dope personality .. I HAVE A GOOD PERSONALITY!!.. but lately all these things have happened to me that have made me all bitter.. ill get into those in future entries.. but yeah.. . i think this is all just coming out right now cause im just getting no where.. and i really havent said what ive wanted to say .. but thats part of it.. so whatever.. ill just have to deal with this at a later point.. i got a physics midterm tomorrow.. i better just end this right quick.. so til then.. WISH ME LUCK.. and pray for me.."

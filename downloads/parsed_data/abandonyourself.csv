"event","Marianna we briefly talked about his book&nbsp;so when i found this I figured why not!!!<br /><br /><br />The 48 Laws of Power <br /><br />by Robert Greene and Joost Elffers <br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"">Law 1: Never Outshine the Master <br /><br />Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please or impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power. <br /><br />Law 2: Never put too Much Trust in Friends, Learn how to use Enemies <br /><br />Be wary of friends-they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them. <br /><br />Law 3: Conceal your Intentions <br /><br />Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrong path, envelope them in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late. <br /><br />Law 4: Always Say Less than Necessary <br /><br />When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish. <br /><br />Law 5: So Much Depends on Reputation Guard it with your Life <br /><br />Reputation is the cornerstone of power. Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win; once you slip, however, you are vulnerable, and will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them. <br /><br />Law 6: Court Attention at all Cost <br /><br />Everything is judged by its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing. Never let yourself get lost in the crowd, then, or buried in oblivion. Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost. Make yourself a magnet of attention by appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious, than the bland and timid masses. <br /><br />Law 7: Get others to do the Work for you, but Always Take the Credit <br /><br />Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own cause. Not only will such assistance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed. In the end your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you. <br /><br />Law 8: Make other People come to you use Bait if Necessary <br /><br />When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent come to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gains then attack. You hold the cards. <br /><br />Law 9: Win through your Actions, Never through Argument <br /><br />Any momentary triumph you think gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate. <br /><br />Law 10: Infection: Avoid the Unhappy and Unlucky <br /><br />You can die from someone elses misery emotional states are as infectious as disease. You may feel you are helping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead. <br /><br />Law 11: Learn to Keep People Dependent on You <br /><br />To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear. Never teach them enough so that they can do without you. <br /><br />Law 12: Use Selective Honesty and Generosity to Disarm your Victim <br /><br />One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones. Open-hearted gestures of honesty and generosity bring down the guard of even the most suspicious people. Once your selective honesty opens a hole in their armor, you can deceive and manipulate them at will. A timely gift a Trojan horse will serve the same purpose. <br /><br />Law 13: When Asking for Help, Appeal to Peoples Self-Interest, Never to their Mercy or Gratitude <br /><br />If you need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your past assistance and good deeds. He will find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He will respond enthusiastically when he sees something to be gained for himself. <br /><br />Law 14: Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy <br /><br />Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead. Better still: Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying. <br /><br />Law 15: Crush your Enemy Totally <br /><br />All great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely. (Sometimes they have learned this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventually break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation: The enemy will recover, and will seek revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit. <br /><br />Law 16: Use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor <br /><br />Too much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear. If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about, even more admired. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity. <br /><br />Law 17: Keep Others in Suspended Terror: Cultivate an Air of Unpredictability <br /><br />Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other peoples actions. Your predictability gives them a sense of control. Turn the tables: Be deliberately unpredictable. Behavior that seems to have no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize. <br /><br />Law 18: Do Not Build Fortresses to Protect Yourself Isolation is Dangerous <br /><br />The world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere everyone has to protect themselves. A fortress seems the safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you from it cuts you off from valuable information, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to circulate among people find allies, mingle. You are shielded from your enemies by the crowd. <br /><br />Law 19: Know Who Youre Dealing with Do Not Offend the Wrong Person <br /><br />There are many different kinds of people in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to your strategies in the same way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives seeking revenge. They are wolves in lambs clothing. Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then never offend or deceive the wrong person. <br /><br />Law 20: Do Not Commit to Anyone <br /><br />It is the fool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself. By maintaining your independence, you become the master of others playing people against one another, making them pursue you. <br /><br />Law 21: Play a Sucker to Catch a Sucker Seem Dumber than your Mark <br /><br />No one likes feeling stupider than the next persons. The trick, is to make your victims feel smart and not just smart, but smarter than you are. Once convinced of this, they will never suspect that you may have ulterior motives. <br /><br />Law 22: Use the Surrender Tactic: Transform Weakness into Power <br /><br />When you are weaker, never fight for honors sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to recover, time to torment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait for his power to wane. Do not give him the satisfaction of fighting and defeating you surrender first. By turning the other check you infuriate and unsettle him. Make surrender a tool of power. <br /><br />Law 23: Concentrate Your Forces <br /><br />Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point. You gain more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flitting from one shallow mine to another intensity defeats extensity every time. When looking for sources of power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the fat cow who will give you milk for a long time to come. <br /><br />Law 24: Play the Perfect Courtier <br /><br />The perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity. He has mastered the art of indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over others in the most oblique and graceful manner. Learn and apply the laws of courtiership and there will be no limit to how far you can rise in the court. <br /><br />Law 25: Re-Create Yourself <br /><br />Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define if for you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life. <br /><br />Law 26: Keep Your Hands Clean <br /><br />You must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency: Your hands are never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds. Maintain such a spotless appearance by using others as scapegoats and cats-paws to disguise your involvement. <br /><br />Law 27: Play on Peoples Need to Believe to Create a Cultlike Following <br /><br />People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. Become the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new faith to follow. Keep your words vague but full of promise; emphasize enthusiasm over rationality and clear thinking. Give your new disciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifices on your behalf. In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring you untold power. <br /><br />Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness <br /><br />If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution. Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid. <br /><br />Law 29: Plan All the Way to the End <br /><br />The ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles, and twists of fortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others. By planning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead. <br /><br />Law 30: Make your Accomplishments Seem Effortless <br /><br />Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and practice that go into them, and also all the clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more. Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard you work it only raises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you. <br /><br />Law 31: Control the Options: Get Others to Play with the Cards you Deal <br /><br />The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victims feel they are in control, but are actually your puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one they choose. Force them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose. Put them on the horns of a dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn. <br /><br />Law 32: Play to Peoples Fantasies <br /><br />The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes for disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses. <br /><br />Law 33: Discover Each Mans Thumbscrew <br /><br />Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness is usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable emotion or need; it can also be a small secret pleasure. Either way, once found, it is a thumbscrew you can turn to your advantage. <br /><br />Law 34: Be Royal in your Own Fashion: Act like a King to be treated like one <br /><br />The way you carry yourself will often determine how you are treated; In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will make people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By acting regally and confident of your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown. <br /><br />Law 35: Master the Art of Timing <br /><br />Never seem to be in a hurry hurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself, and over time. Always seem patient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually. Become a detective of the right moment; sniff out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry you to power. Learn to stand back when the time is not yet ripe, and to strike fiercely when it has reached fruition. <br /><br />Law 36: Disdain Things you cannot have: Ignoring them is the best Revenge <br /><br />By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It is sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it. The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem. <br /><br />Law 37: Create Compelling Spectacles <br /><br />Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura of power everyone responds to them. Stage spectacles for those around you, then full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence. Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing. <br /><br />Law 38: Think as you like but Behave like others <br /><br />If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior. It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness. <br /><br />Law 39: Stir up Waters to Catch Fish <br /><br />Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always stay calm and objective. But if you can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage. Put your enemies off-balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings. <br /><br />Law 40: Despise the Free Lunch <br /><br />What is offered for free is dangerous it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. What has worth is worth paying for. By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is also often wise to pay the full price there is no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating, for generosity is a sign and a magnet for power. <br /><br />Law 41: Avoid Stepping into a Great Mans Shoes <br /><br />What happens first always appears better and more original than what comes after. If you succeed a great man or have a famous parent, you will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them. Do not get lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not of your own making: Establish your own name and identity by changing course. Slay the overbearing father, disparage his legacy, and gain power by shining in your own way. <br /><br />Law 42: Strike the Shepherd and the Sheep will Scatter <br /><br />Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individual the stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoned of goodwill. If you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not wait for the troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them they are irredeemable. Neutralize their influence by isolating or banishing them. Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will scatter. <br /><br />Law 43: Work on the Hearts and Minds of Others <br /><br />Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you. You must seduce others into wanting to move in your direction. A person you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn. And the way to seduce others is to operate on their individual psychologies and weaknesses. Soften up the resistant by working on their emotions, playing on what they hold dear and what they fear. Ignore the hearts and minds of others and they will grow to hate you. <br /><br />Law 44: Disarm and Infuriate with the Mirror Effect <br /><br />The mirror reflects reality, but it is also the perfect tool for deception: When you mirror your enemies, doing exactly as they do, they cannot figure out your strategy. The Mirror Effect mocks and humiliates them, making them overreact. By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their values; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a lesson. Few can resist the power of Mirror Effect. <br /><br />Law 45: Preach the Need for Change, but Never Reform too much at Once <br /><br />Everyone understands the need for change in the abstract, but on the day-to-day level people are creatures of habit. Too much innovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. If you are new to a position of power, or an outsider trying to build a power base, make a show of respecting the old way of doing things. If change is necessary, make it feel like a gentle improvement on the past. <br /><br />Law 46: Never appear too Perfect <br /><br />Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity. <br /><br />Law 47: Do not go Past the Mark you Aimed for; In Victory, Learn when to Stop <br /><br />The moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril. In the heat of victory, arrogance and overconfidence can push you past the goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more enemies than you defeat. Do not allow success to go to your head. There is no substitute for strategy and careful planning. Set a goal, and when you reach it, stop. <br /><br />Law 48: Assume Formlessness <br /><br />By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack. Instead of taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move. Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. The best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting order. Everything changes. <br /><br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"">Here Are The Top Ten Reasons Why Women Keep Themselves From Living The Love Life Of They're Dreams-- And How To Make Sure You Avoid Every One Of Them... <br /><br />MISTAKE #1: Betting Your <br />Love Life On His ""Potential"" <br /><br />Do you know any women who want the man they're dating to behave differently? <br /><br />Of course you do. <br /><br />And just like me, I'm sure you have friends who date guys who don't have much going for them or who don't treat them very well. <br /><br />Somehow these women always have an excuse for the guy's shortcomings. <br /><br />What's going on here? <br /><br />It's actually very simple. <br /><br />Women (and men) don't base their choices of men on how ""nice"" or ""good"" someone is to them day-to-day. <br /><br />Women choose the men they do because they feel a powerful GUT LEVEL ATTRACTION for them. <br /><br />And guess what? <br /><br />Some women will continue to put up with a guy that doesn't treat them very well. <br /><br />Sometimes for months or years... <br /><br />But why in the world would a woman do that!? <br /><br />Well, to put it simply, they confuse the strong attraction they feel for the guy with a deeper ""connection"". <br /><br />Women who do this are doomed to end up in failed relationships with the ""wrong"" guys. <br /><br />How do I know? <br /><br />Because I've seen it at least a hundred times... <br /><br />And because I've been this guy in the past myself. <br /><br />Thinking back on past dating and relationships I've had, I was selfish and didn't offer much. <br /><br />I'm amazed the women put up with me. <br /><br />But they did...all the while hoping that I would somehow change. <br /><br />The women I dated hoped I'd change. <br /><br />The only thing they saw in me that led them to want to keep me around was the ""potential"" they saw in me to share my feelings and communicate with them. <br /><br />The potential for something better and the potential for me to change and be a better lover, boyfriend, companion or whatever... <br /><br />The truth was, I was hopelessly bad at these things at the time. <br /><br />And more importantly, I wasn't even at a place in my life where I knew how to or was interested in developing a deep and committed relationship - with ANYONE. <br /><br />But deep down these women believed that if they tried hard enough, that it would make up for what was lacking. <br /><br />They believed that I could become someone else with them.... and that this would be easy for us both. <br /><br />Talk about a losing battle. <br /><br />It doesn't make a lot of ""logical"" sense... <br /><br />But until you accept that lots of women do this AND that YOU could be doing it on some level, you'll NEVER have the success with men that you choose and want. <br /><br /><br />MISTAKE #2: Assuming You <br />""Get"" Men &amp; Their Psychology <br /><br />Men are different from women. <br /><br />You need to accept this fact, and deal with it. <br /><br />When a woman sees a man, she can very quickly pick apart certain things about his style, body language, status and character that will tell her all kinds of things about him. <br /><br />Lot's of women don't even consciously see that they do this because the process is so obvious and simple for them. <br /><br />But does the same apply for men? <br /><br />As you probably already know, men are generally more visual. <br /><br />As a result, they often don't understand non-verbal communication as well as women. <br /><br />And men often lack what women have in emotional awareness and ""intuition"". <br /><br />Women don't seem to remember this about men. <br /><br />So do men feel sexually attracted to w0men based just on looks? Or is something else going on? <br /><br />Well, after studying this topic for years now, and talking to thousands of men and women, I can tell you that men have their ""attraction mechanisms"" triggered by things OTHER than looks. <br /><br />Especially when it comes to longer term relationships. <br /><br />Looks just happen to be the most obvious way... <br /><br />But looks are NOT the most powerful. <br /><br />If you know how to use your body language AND communication correctly, you can make men feel the same kind of powerful sexual attraction to you that YOU feel when you see that hot, great looking guy that you got to know. <br /><br />But it's not an accident. <br /><br />You have to LEARN how to do this. <br /><br />And ANY woman can learn how... <br /><br /><br />MISTAKE #3: Pretending To <br />Be Something For A Man <br /><br />In the desire to please a man, women are constantly doing things to get a man's attention, to get him to like them or to make him more attracted or in love with them. <br /><br />Another HORRIBLE idea. <br /><br />Lots of women mistakenly think that doing unusual things to try and get a guys attention will make him magically see what a great catch they are and want to be with them. <br /><br />Wrong. <br /><br />Men YOU TRULY WANT are never attracted to the types of women who kiss up to them, make weak plays for affection or complain to get what they want... EVER. <br /><br />Don't get me wrong here. Things like being sexy for a man or encouraging him to share his feelings can be good, but it has to be genuine, unselfish, and most of all timely. <br /><br />You don't have to act like an ""easy"" woman for men to like you, and you certainly don't have to play like he's some gift to the Earth. <br /><br />Doing these things actually works to subtly, at an subconscious level, lower your social status with a man, which has EVERYTHING to do with how he sees you as a woman. <br /><br />So if you think that making him more attracted to you means ""playing to the man's fantasies"" from the start, think again. <br /><br />You'll never succeed by looking for a man's approval, finding your way into his heart through sex and not being yourself. <br /><br /><br />MISTAKE #4: Sharing How You <br />""Feel"" Too Early With Him <br /><br />Another huge and unfortunate mistake that most women make with men is sharing how they ""feel"" too early on. <br /><br />Listen... <br /><br />Attractive, single, successful men are rare. <br /><br />They get a LOT of attention from women. <br /><br />Most women don't realize this, but attractive men are being approached in one way or another all the time by women. <br /><br />And guess what? <br /><br />Attractive men have usually dated a lot of women. <br /><br />That's right. They have EXPERIENCE. <br /><br />They know what to expect. <br /><br />And one thing that turns an attractive men off and sends him running away faster than just about anything... <br /><br />It's a woman who starts saying ""You know, I really, REALLY like you"" after one or two dates. <br /><br />This signals to the man that you're just like one of those ""clingy"" stereotype women who want to rush into a relationship and can't control yourself from wanting a man to fulfill them and complete their lives. <br /><br />This does NOT spell ATTRACTION for a man. <br /><br />Don't do it. Lean back. Relax. <br /><br />There's a much better way... <br /><br /><br />MISTAKE #5: Misreading The <br />Important ""Signals"" That Men Send <br /><br />Men are constantly communicating how they feel about a woman and giving away big secrets about themselves. <br /><br />Most women don't pay attention to these signals or recognize them for what they really are. <br /><br />The signals men send have 4 main levels: <br /><br />1) Social: Where the man is at in his own life - stability, confidence, direction <br /><br />2) Emotional: Whether or not he's ""emotionally available"" <br /><br />3) Physical: If he's attracted to you... and for what reasons <br /><br />4) Love State: If he's open to building and growing a relationship in the future <br /><br />The funny thing is that men send signals in these areas completely on accident. <br /><br />That's great news to women... <br /><br />Men can't help it! <br /><br />You need to learn to recognize these signals to get anywhere serious with a man. <br /><br /><br />MISTAKE #6: Relying On <br />Your Natural Ability To <br />Judge A Man's Character <br /><br />People aren't easy to figure out. <br /><br />Especially men. <br /><br />The last part of my life I've spent hundreds of hours learning to understand people. <br /><br />I've studied peoples behavior, ""inner psychology"" and more specifically how they think and act when they're dating. <br /><br />From what I've seen, both men and women have their own secret ways of saying things. <br /><br />But you can only see these secret communications if you know what to look for. <br /><br />Women communicate with hints, body language, sarcasm, and flirting when they're first getting to know a man. <br /><br />They can either directly or indirectly let men know if they're open to something more serious. <br /><br />Men are different. <br /><br />Men generally communicate with sarcasm, humor, cockyness and other ""indirect"" displays of status. <br /><br />VERY RARELY will a man be able to honestly communicate to a woman whether or not he's ready or capable of developing a meaningful relationship. <br /><br />Aside from their sexual interests, men send very indirect signals about where they're at. <br /><br />If you don't know how to read through the signals men send, then you'll get the wrong message. <br /><br />Getting the wrong messages from men causes women more pain and heartache than any other issue around. <br /><br />You can avoid this pain if you learn to indentify a good man from a bad one. <br /><br /><br />MISTAKE #7: Expecting A <br />Relationship To Make You Happy <br /><br />A mistake I've seen women make is thinking a guy will change her life and make her happy and fulfilled. <br /><br />And sure, there are situations and relationships where this happens. <br /><br />But those are the exceptions, not the rule. <br /><br />Nothing says ""Run!"" to a man faster than hearing or sensing that a woman immediately wants him to take care of her. <br /><br />And the men who ARE looking for this kind of situation aren't exactly the most healthy, loving, nurturing people out there. <br /><br />Think, ""controlling, macho, or serious Mom Issues!"" <br /><br />So let me be clear... <br /><br />I think it's important that people help fulfill each other in their lives, whether it's dating, a relationship, whatever. <br /><br />But if a woman communicates that she's looking for a guy to take care of her, complete her, make her whole, and all that kind of stuff - it has a VERY negative effect on what the man will think of her. <br /><br />It doesn't have to be spoken by the woman either... <br /><br />If a woman thinks or feels this way, the man will see it and pick up on it, regardless. <br /><br />This is arguably the worst thing a woman can do early on when dating a man. <br /><br />So what can you do as a woman? <br /><br />You can get the man interested and involved in your life in a more ""natural"" way, where he'll be motivated to make you care about your happiness and fulfillment on his own. <br /><br />This is the only way it really works for people - male or female. <br /><br />Self-motivation is much stronger than external motivation. <br /><br />But you have to know how to create this situation with a man... and it rarely happens by accident. <br /><br /><br />MISTAKE #8: Trying To ""Convince"" <br />Him To Like You Or Love You <br /><br />What do most women do when they meet a man that they REALLY like... but he's just not that interested or isn't as serious? <br /><br />Right! They try to ""convince"" the man to feel differently. <br /><br />Well, I have news for you... <br /><br />YOU WILL NEVER CHANGE HOW A MAN ""FEELS"" WHEN IT COMES TO ATTRACTION! <br /><br />Never, ever, ever. <br /><br />You cannot convince a man to feel differently about you with ""logic and reasoning"". <br /><br />Think about it. <br /><br />If a man doesn't ""feel it"" for you, how in the world do you expect to change that by being ""reasonable"" with him? <br /><br />But we all do it. <br /><br />Men are the worst at this by the way. <br /><br />They're always complimenting women who don't like them and buying them gifts. <br /><br />Women like the behavior sometimes, but it NEVER makes the woman like the man. <br /><br />She might enjoy what she gets out of it, but it doesn't change the way she FEELS about him. <br /><br />When a man just isn't interested, women will try and chase, compliment, convince and do their best to change his mind with logical and rational approaches. <br /><br />Bad idea. Another one that will never work. <br /><br /><br />MISTAKE #9: Not Knowing <br />What To Do In Each Type Of Situation <br /><br />A man has a clear idea of what he wants from a woman... <br /><br />And I don't mean just sex. <br /><br />I know, it might be hard to believe, but if you're out on a date with a man, he already has an idea of what he wants from you. <br /><br />And if you don't know HOW to find this out, and you just sit there looking at him and flirting, or trying things you think will make him want you, he won't help! <br /><br />If you don't know what to do in each situation, you'll probably screw it up... and LOSE EVERYTHING. <br /><br /><br />MISTAKE #10: Not Getting Help <br /><br />This is the biggest mistake of all. <br /><br />This mistake keeps women from EVER having the kind of success and finding the kind of man and relationship that they truly want. <br /><br />I know, you don't like to make yourself look weak or helpless. We don't like to ask for help. <br /><br />Hey, I've been there myself. <br /><br />Let me tell you a little about me. <br /><br />Over the last few years it's been hard to watch the women around me (even those I dated) struggle to understand the men they were attracted to or dating. <br /><br />It frustrated the hell out of me and I made the decision to do whatever it took to help the women I knew learn how to be successful with men and dating. <br /><br />Well, after a lot of hard work and doing all kinds of crazy things to learn the real-world truth about men and women, I finally figured things out for myself. <br /><br />I've read hundreds of books on psychology, human behavior, dating/relationship advice for men and women, love, attraction, communication, and more. The list goes on. <br /><br />I can now approach just about any situation with dating and feel confident and understand everything that's going on in an interaction. <br /><br />Best of all, I've been able to share my knowledge and help women become more successful with men and dating. <br /><br />It's been a very rewarding experience, and it's how I became fascinated with the female perspective in the dating world. <br /><br />I've helped women get rid of that sick, insecure feeling... the one you get when you're lonely, you've been hurt or lied to, or when a man you have feelings for says ""he's not ready"". <br /><br />You don't have to be afraid you might wind up being lied to, cheated on or that you'll end up alone.<br /></div>"

<i>She was very young, and too pretty for her own good.  He discussed with James at some length the problem of beauty in a woman, and whether it was her fault that her strength was not equal to her temptations.  ""This strength,"" Chen said, ""might actually be greater than that of an ugly woman, but the ugly woman is praised for a self-control which may in fact be very slight indeed.""</i>
This is an excerpt from the book I'm reading for the second time.  It's Kinfolk by Pearl S. Buck.  If an attractive woman is propositioned many times in her life, either she accepts the first proposal of her life, or she becomes accustomed  to them, and takes each as an opportunity not to be directly exploited.  Or she takes advantage of each proposition in equality.

In the first case, I think the woman is naive.  She honestly does not think another proposal is coming to her because of an external or internal flaw.  Or her impatience and desire to live with the valued reputation of purity and receive the benefits of a proposition outweighs the subsequent opportunities that may arise later.

In the second case, if a woman becomes used to suitors vying for her, she may decide to pick among her choices, either from a distance or personal relationship.  Distance still gives the illusion of purity, but by a biblical standpoint, purity is in thought as well as action.  If a woman was to discern between options by thought alone, she already has begun dismantling the human based on her needs and wants, and has not retained spiritual purity, though the body is sound.

In the last case, a woman who exploits every gift and benefit given to her has retained no level of purity, not even has she retained respect for another human.  The loss of respect for gifts and adoration in an ostentatious display of ones own plummage is perhaps the greatest belittling of ones own nature, to use oneself as a commodity.

For the ugly woman, the first option is likely, the third option is unlikely, and the second even more so, however even a woman accounted unattractive by the standards of aesthetics has greater chances than woman of the time this book was written.  Even an unattractive woman has much to offer, and an attractive woman her own set of flaws.  I think today the point of attractive vs. unattractive is based less on visual aspect, and more founded on the comodities each party can bring to the shared household dish.  Distemper and instability, wealth and status become magnified as our options for finding the elusive ""soul mate"" grow, and dissatisfaction can be easily rectified by the endless supply of dating websites who provide an infinite number of suitors.

The two kinds of women in this world have ceased to be enough anymore, and now the mother type must meld with the stimulating type.  The woman who rasies her children must also stimulate a man's mind and give him ideas, while cooking his meals, and providing for his pleasure.  One or the other is no longer enough, and when a man matures to the point he wants children, he can easily be lured back to his youth temporarily by the woman who reminds him his body chemistry remains the same vital intensity the length of his life, while his wifes vitality grows old and falls into disrepair before his own.  What point is there in denying his body of its natural want?  Because like women, man want to be viewed with respect and degrees of adoration.  As long as the body and mind are satisfied in complete harmony, everything else follows.  And does the body need to be satisfied by the same woman who satisfies the mind?  Either the two types of women are happy in their respective places, or one woman must find within herself a balence with which to balence her mate.

Self-control is generally ruled by external forces.  Even one who guides their life by pure thought and actions cannot be forever unswayed by the world in which they live.  Concessions are made with the misinterpretations of a society, and the general will of the immediate surroundings are enough to break down even the internal self.  The will of a person to deprive themselves the comradery of less pure examples is determined by the ease with which they live their current values system.  When one must work for their values, they are less valuable and a hinderance, and that is our nature."

UPDATED: 10:26 am PDT October 14, 2005


SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Two women were killed in a crash involving a suspected drunken driver on Interstate 80 early Friday.

The crash happened about 2 a.m. in the eastbound lanes near Madison Avenue.

California Highway Patrol officials said a white pickup truck slammed into a Mercedes that pulled to the side of the freeway. Two women who were standing outside of the Mercedes were struck. One of the women was dragged 50 feet and pronounced dead at an area hospital. The other died a short time later.

Authorities said the women were passengers in the Mercedes, which had pulled over because one of the women was feeling sick. Their identies have not been released.

""Another vehicle traveling on eastbound I-80 drifted into the right shoulder and struck the two pedestrians ... and then struck the gold Mercedes,"" CHP Officer Liz Dutton said.

The truck then flipped over. The male driver and a passenger were taken to an area hospital with minor injuries.

CHP officials said the driver of the pickup had been drinking and is facing charges of driving under the influence and vehicular manslaughter.

"event","ever feel like you're so alone , but you know you're not? 


Late at night when the moon is rising,

Bright the stars for it is mesmorising.

As thick as the clouds move thru the sky,

Oh how it feels when the cool breeze just dies.

Lovely the dark night, creeps through so deep,

Puts all, but the souls in a death like sleep.

Feeling so lonely as the night goes by,

Being so helpless and I begin to cry.

Does anyone hear me as I weap my sorrow?

Does anyone care if I am here tomorrow?

Timely the manner as my heart consoles,

For the dark within me begins to unfold.

Plain and simple that I might see, 

Sooner or later the wild bird shall be set free.

Whispers of fury fall from above,

No one to cry to, no one to love.

As I sit here waiting for a show of a sign,

Knowing all the sadness shall soon be mine.

As crazy as it may seem,

believe me now this is not a dream.......

"event","<DIV>hola phil ... </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>thanks for your last e-mail and for this one. yes, i'm fine ... just haven't had power for two days and probably won't have any until sunday. which means no ice, no light, no internet, and, worst of all, no air-conditioning in alabama in august! still, i've been lucky. two of my neighbors have had their houses crushed by overturned trees. i'm e-mailing from work, which suddenly seems like a great place to be. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>it's interesting, though -- the fact that no one has power means that everyone is bored to tears at home. tuscaloosa has suddenly become a real town, with people gathering on streetcorners to talk, going on walks, and gathering in each other's houses to eat up all their food before it goes bad (yup, no power = no refrigerator). </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>by the way, i would love your footage of sandi's performance, although i don't know what mp4 is. can an mp3 player play it? incidentally, i did get my dvd burner working, although i don't really recommend the program i bought (dvdclonerII). </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>how's the automobile world? and how are you? <BR></DIV>
<DIV>un beso, <BR>lili </DIV>"

"event","Ok, its been a while so here I go: Yesterday was my day off, and lately i got some crazy cold thing going on, this in the middle of summer was odd, but i just drink a red bull to get past it. I was going to meet sandi for lunch, as i was getting on the freeway of course everyone is slowing down to look at a CHP officer outside his vehicle with the lights on... I'm thinkin someone wasn't paying attention to the car in front of them... On my double take I realize it's actually a homeless guy holding his ""Why Lie, I need a BEER"" sign asking for money. (I've been on that exit, I've given him enough for a 40oz King Cobra) And of course the CHP officer is writing him a ticket! I wish I had my camera at that moment, I would have stopped traffic, and made it a damn KODAK MOMENT! The things I could do with a picture like that! I had plenty of time to think about my tax payer money going to that officer as he wrote that ticket, but hey he's off the freeway, i can drive at 80mph and not have to worry right??? RIGHT!?!
<BR>
But what do you tell a cop in that scenario? Ok, so he may believe you are giving him the right name, if you dont have a proper ""ID"" what what do you put down for an address? Exit 34? I-80 and Madison Ave? I may just give that a try! Tell the cop my address is I-80 and Madison Ave from 3pm-5pm it's the rush home hour people give more money during those hours especially when its payday... its better on the 15th of the month... Mortgages and Car paymnents are due on the 1st or the 5th... Never during lunch hour i take money from their stomachs! they cant supersize that big mac meal, thats when a homeless person gets the famous ""get a job"" line!... <I>I really need to stop beating this thing into the ground</I>
<BR>
So by now im almost at my exit, and of course I make it 10 minutes late... I hate it when i do that! She's cool with it, besides she worked there before, she saying hello to her old co-workers. The food was food considering i hadn't eaten in almost a day, this hot weather and ""cold"" don't make me hungry. During the course of our meal we got into a ""argument"" about how I was going to teach her how to drive a stick shift vehicle a year and a half ago... OK, from now on I will teach people how to drive a 5 speed or 6 speed if you are lucky enough in your own vehicle. She stalled mine out a couple of times, almost ran into a tree looking thing, but get this she actually made my car not start for about 5 minutes... it was no good, but she got it into reverse and 1st gear... until... yea! That's where i'll leave it at!

I ended the day at my boss' house to set up his wireless internet, and home entertainment system, he just got some wall speakers put in. 

So aside from my car stalling out, my brother getting locked out of his house for the next week (his roomates know he's a partier changed the locks while they're in Monterey til next wednesday) I must say its been worth it! That and the Japenese update for the PSP works on US models, now i have another internet browser my cellphone's wasnt fast enough! The wallpaper option is perfect for the PSP! Ahh! Once again technology to the rescue!

1. Reply with your name and i will write something I like about you.
2. I will then tell what song reminds me of you.
3. If i were to apply an o'clock to you (that's TIME-OF-DAY for our dumb friends), i'll tell you what it would be.
4. I will try to name a single word that best describes you. try to.
5. I'll tell you the most memorable moment i've had with you. (yes, even those kinds of moments...because, you know, they all count!)
6. I will tell you what color you remind me of.

"event","Don't explain yourself to much. Sorcerers say that in every explanation there is a hidden apology. So, when you are explaining why you cannot do this or that, you're really apologizing for your shortcomings, hoping that whoever is listening to you will have the kindness to understand them.
      Every one of us, young and old alike, is making figures in front of a mirror in one way or another. Tally what you know about people. Think of any human being on this earth, and you will know, without a shadow of a doubt, that no matter who they are, or what they think of themselves, or what they do, the result of their actions is always the same: senseless figures in front of a mirror."

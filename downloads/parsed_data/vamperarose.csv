I always catch my breath 
& I'm still standing here, 
& you're miles away 
& I'm wonderin why you left 
& theres a storm thats raging
through my frozen heart tonight 

I hear your name in certain circles, 
and it always makes me smile 
I spend my time thinkin about you, 
& its almost driving me wild 
& theres a heart thats breaking 
down this long distance line tonight 

I aint missing you at all 
since you've been gone away 
I aint missing you, 
no matter what I might say 

Theres a message in the wire, 
& I'm sending you this signal tonight 
you dont know how desperate I've become 
& it looks like I'm losing this fight 
In your world I have no meaning, 
though I'm trying hard to understand 
& its my heart thats breaking 
down this long distance line tonight 

Chorus: 
I aint missing you at all 
since you've been gone away 
I aint missing you, 
no matter what my friends say 

& theres a message 
that I'm sending out, 
like a telegraph 
to your soul 
& if I cant bridge 
this distance, stop 
this heartbreak overload 

(chorus) 

I aint missing you, 
I aint missing you, 
I can lie to myself 

& theres a storm 
thats raging through 
my frozen heart tonight

As I've Matured... 


I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is stalk
them and hope they panic and give in. 

 
I've learned that one good turn gets most of the blankets. 

 
I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just jackasses.


I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it only takes
suspicion, not proof, to destroy it. 

 
I've learned that whatever hits the fan will not be evenly distributed. 

 
I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others - they are more
screwed up than you think. 

  
I've learned to not sweat the petty things, and not pet the sweaty things. 

 
I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are
celebrities. 

  
I've learned that 99% of the time when something isn't working in your house
one of your kids did it. 

  
I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you
too soon and all the less important ones just never go away. And the real
pains in the ass are permanent. 


---------------------------------------

so... today has been pretty boring. Cleaned house all day (boy did it need it!), did laundry, played with the dog, been on here chatting, and visit Becky and Lee for a little bit.

Jes has to work late today  :-(

The ""puter nerd"" as I like to refer to him as, is coming over later to fix up my other puter. It will be so much better! I'll have AOL 9.0 and it'll be a whole hell of a lot faster. Heh, im excited. That's pretty sad lol.

So... that's my day. Im tired.

Probably over a summer. I dont know who took the picture. Im on my bed, and Charlie is sitting slightly behind me, his arm around my sholder. Smiling to the camera. Im staring like im surprised/angry, i probably wasn't though. I dont know why it struck me. It was such a clear picture, such an old picture. But not even that old. Why cant I stop staring at it? Maybe its cause i dont know the people in that picture. Well I do, but....i remember that shirt....I remember that chair... I remember that day....Why am i saying all this? to an audience that is basically me. What point am I trying to make? am I trying to make a point?

""self destructive pattern""


Feel the tension of rejection
Bleach it out with therapy
The confusion exseclusion
Turns into my deformity

Never trust it, maladjusted
I've become my own worst enemy
The aggravation in my fixation
Keeps it all controlled inside of me

See it all collapsing, it's all around me
This condition is killing me
The isolation still surrounds me
In remission but it's killing me

It's what I can't control
What I can't control
What I can't control in me

Born again I feel so hollow
Torn again my senses fade
Mourn again without the sorrow
Born again without the blame

Force a new sollution, it's all inside me
In remission but it's killing me
Evolution is divided
In remission but it's killing me

I can't increase the treatment
It won't suppress the feelings
Or stop the way I'm getting
Used to the pain

Breaking down
Self-destructive pattern




Guess

anti choice
anti girl
I am the anti-flag unfurled
anti white and anti law
I got the anti-future plan

anti whore
there will never be enough of anti more
I can't believe in the things

anti people now you've gone too far
here's your antichrist superstar
anti money
anti hate
anti things I fucked and ate

"event","Some ""wisdom"" thoughts... or opinons, whatever you wanna call it....



Popularity is shit. To do something because it is popular, or NOT to do something because it is popular, or to do something that is not popular BECAUSE it's not popular is absolutely fucking retarded, and don't let me ever catch you say you're a 'true' individual. Ever. You're a retard. Sorry.


I have learned throughout my lifetime that there is no such thing as 'common sense'.

Truth in jest? Absolutely. Don't discard the little twang of hurt you feel when someone makes a joke at your expense. Remember the hurt, and remember how they laughed. This is your 'friend'. Remember it, that's all. Don't be surprised when the chips are down that they aren't sitting at your table, anymore.


People think too highly of themselves. We are all only worth about the same as a small calibur bullet.


Again: There is a difference between 'criticism' and 'ridicule'. Learn to recognize both. Many do not seem to know the difference. Same with 'fact' and 'opinion'.



hump. Life. Reality. Bullshit.

Here's another thing.....


""I've always thought it was about individuality, anyway. But more and more, I'm beginning to doubt that whole 'individuality' bullshit. 

If we're individuals, why are there fads? Trends? Cliques? We want to belong, but we want to remain ourselves. To be us being others. Ha. You can't do anything, anymore, without someone saying something either for or against it. Oh well.
I've never been popular. I don't suppose I ever will be. But then, I don't know that I'd want to be. Because for some reason I feel I'd rather be an 'individual'.""

Spoken like a 'true individual' if I may say so myself... HA.

"event","Useful math...  

 Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 
100%? 
 
 We have all been to those meetings where someone wants over 100%. 
 
 How about achieving 103%? Here's a little math that might prove helpful. 
 
 What makes life 100%? 
 
 If A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z is represented as: 
 
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 
 
 Then, 
 
 H A R D W O R K 
 8 1 18 4 23 15 18 11 = 98% 

 K N O W L E D G E 
 11 14 15 23 12 5 4 7 5 = 96% 
 
 But, 
 
 A T T I T U D E 
 1 20 20 9 20 21 4 5 = 100% 
 
 And, 
 
 B U L L S H I T 
 2 21 12 12 19 8 9 20 = 103% 
 
 So, it stands to reason that hard work and knowledge will get you close, 
 attitude will get you there, but bullshit will always put you over the top!!"

Today was pretty cool. Like I mentioned earlier, I got to help someone out ::smile::
I got to talk to my mom for awhile. That was cool. John wasen't there to bug here and we actually really got to talk.
I got up, took the dog for a ""power"" walk, then did some Taebo, cleaned house, and then RAN , yes i did say RAN to the store. It was kinda fun. I really like doing Taebo and my 8 min. ab workout. It really does work. I think Im gonna stop being such a lazy bum all the time and do more of both. Hmm... yes I think I will. 
I am becoming such a FAT slob!!

I believe that we must admit whatever we think we're alone with, and tell the microscopic truth about ourselves. We are incredibly resilient creatures if we learn to let it all flow through...if we become transparent and stop hiding our aloneness."

Another turning point a fork stuck in the road

Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial

"event","""Some people's lives have ups and downs. I understand this, it is how life goes. Hell, I'd say that is how most lives go. Exhillerating highs, crushing lows, and the rest of the time in between. I've watched my friends (and people I call my friends out of desperation, even though they don't fit my usual criteria of what a friend is) experience those lately. It's made me think. I've seen people like me, people so much like me that it is actually making me doubt my individuality as a person, experience these.

Somehow, I just keep experiencing lows and the somewhere in between. Most days are just OK, and some are crushing lows. I try to think of the last time I had a real high... and the only one I can think of was tinged with a feeling of uneasyness. A feeling that was proven to be more than just paranoia. Still, even with that it was better than anything else. It was a feeling of being enveloped in being loved and wanted. Still, other than that it is just OK and bad. 

Flashes of happiness, lasting mere seconds, are all I can hope for here. The line spikes above 0 in a flash. A joke, a laugh, a shared experience. But those things are unable to hold the line up for long. How quickly it drops... and usually it's momentum takes it far below zero.""

I didn't write the above, but i wanted to post it because it is really true. I thought of everyone I knew. Sometime life can be such a joke, only except, noone laughs anymore. Crule, harsh reality hits."

Shopping makes me happy on a rainy day. What eles is there to do?
I use to love going shopping. Now, i dont really go anymore unless i really need something. I think tt's because when I lived with my gram all she ever wanted to do was go to walmart or go shopping. It got old after a while but if i said no, she got an additude. Hump. All well. Jes hasen't complained about my ""no shopping"" protest LOL. He acctually likes it. I dont spend all his money. HA HA HA. But today..... today was a different story. I went shopping. And it was good cuz' I actually went and bought for myself. And it felt good. BAHHAHHHAAAHAHAHA! 

Im feeling really dorky today for some reason. Maybe I haven't grown up after all.

Oh yeah. My hair looks wicked fucking cool now. It's, light gold brown, with dark brown highlights (almost looks black) and blonde highlights. It looks kick ass! Jes really likes it. I wasen't sure if i did at first cuz' its kinda weird for me, but now i love it. Thinking about putting some more almost black highlights in it to. hmmm....

Alright... well i really must be going. I've gotta go pick Caitlyn up from school in a half hour and I want to run over to Becky's first, and then I gotta go to Kims. Kims gonna let me ride with her (she goes to pick up her daughter) cuz' its raining. YAY! HA HA.

"event","***""Thank God for the Marines With loaded M-16's.""***

""As I pass onto base this morning, I am struck by the surreal nature of what i see. Slowly, I pass through the gates and past the first of many men in uniform. Everyday I see you standing at the gates, but today I drive through as in an alter-reality. You are holding a loaded M-16 rifle in your hand.
The routine gate check is not what it was- what seems just moments ago. I am stopped at the check point- right here in the United States Of America- and surrounded by the uniformed men and women, all carrying loaded M-16s. It does not feel real. They ask to see my identification, as one uniformed man with a loaded M-16 rifle brings the bomb sniffing dog around the exterior of my car. While yet another armed man in uniform looks through the interior of the vehicle where I sit. They smile at me and are kind. They are patient when the hood of my car will not open. They carry loaded weapons. I am not afraid. I laugh with them as they close my doors and wave me to go by. They see in us their mothers, and their sisters, and their children, and their wifes. I thank them and smile. I am over taken by a feeling of appreciation, and deep saddness. We see in them our fathers, our brothers, our sons, and our husbands. This is a military base. To me it is home.
There are men with loaded M-16s standing at the entrance to housing. I am not afraid. They nod and smile. It is surreal. I feel like I am driving through the unfimiliar territory of an abstract painting. The landscape almost is familiar, but it is all confused.
They stand in uniform and guard. They are ready for me they stand in the heat all day and still smile. I have the overwhelming urge to rush home and bake brownies to bring back to these men...but brownies seem trivial. They are carrying loaded M-16s.
I rush to call my parents and my siblings... I want to hold my husband's hand, but I can not. He is not next to me, he stands with those in uniform.
I know the duty that calls for those in uniform to stand with loaded M-16s. They stand for all the lifes within this land. They stand for righteouness and freedom. They stand for the country. 
I will stand by you. I will smile even when I want to cry because I know it won't be easy for you, and a smile may lighten your load. I will see in you all that I hold dear, as you see in me those dear to you.
I thank God, for each who came before you and carried the same burden you do now. It is because of them, it is because of you, that this nation is free. I thank you for your willingness to stand watch in this nation with loaded M-16s in your hand.""

I know Amanda has this posted on hers, (I sent it to her), but i had to put it on mine to.
Amanda is right and i couldn't say it any better - shit matters down here, unlike up there. People give a shit here because it is our ""Home"". Its our husbands and wives and daddies and mothers who are out there EVERY day risking their life for everyone in the world!! Shit does matter here. It hits real close to home! Thankyou Amanda for posting this, it means a lot.

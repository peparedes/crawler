"event","<STRONG><FONT color=#6600cc>well fred and i had a good day to start off with. hes just started his new job and i start mine this thursday. well we havent been able to hang out let alone talk alot. so i went to his house, i cleaned up his room and chris came over. chris has been staying over freds house till he gets a car, he rides with fred to work in the morning. well for some reason i was having an off day and we had such a good day together that i didnt want anything to screw up. our relationship has been great for the most part. well, he told me i was being way to overbaering and not acting myself. and we sat down and talked and he says i need to work on my atittude, my wearabouts and just not worry so much about getting hurt again. just take life in strides and go with it.. he doesnt understand why im so woried. fred and i have been together for 3 years off and on so many times. that im so scared to death of loosing him and having nothing. all these times weve broken up, well i always have that what if feeling in the back of my head. fred is my everything. id do anything to make him happy. theres no question that i want to spend the rest of my life with him. hes such an awsome person and i want him in my life and one day have a family.&nbsp; but i agree with him that moving in with him wouldnt be a good idea to a point. it would be hard on the relationship. and ive heard you cant live with them unless your going to get married. it just doesnt work. but i cant stand being away from him. i guess thats just the person ive become. im to depended on him. i wish i had a car. id fined a better job, have a life out side of my house and be more active. thats whats holding me back. i dont care if all m y money goes towards bills and my car, at least having it would be better for me. id have freedom. and i wouldnt be so up tight with fred. i think im driving him away sometimes. and thats the last thing i want to do, ill give him all the space he needs just to keep him happy. hes the light in my life. hes my best friend and nothing is worth loosing that. thats another thing, my friend chris from georgia is comming down. yes chris and i have ""dated"" but i dont want fred to think bad thoughts of him. im trying to put myself in freds shoes, now if that girl ""alley"" came down to stay at his house for 3 days, how would i feel? i tell you what id be a nervus freak, wouldnt sleep, up all night wondering whats going on, what does she want with him and stupid things, but the fact is, i know fred doesnt want anything like that with alley. and i hope fred knows that chris and i are just friends and nothing will ever happen. i have nothing against alley ecept the fact that they had sex once, thats what fred tells me. and him and alley used to be really good friends. well, ive never had sex with chris, i did nothing behind freds back while i was in georgia and fred has nothing to worry about. but i do understand where hes comming from. so thats why when i get this job, im going to save money to put chris and his friend oliver in a hotel, so they dont have to stay at my house and that will prevent so much shit. and hopfuly chris and fred will get along. </FONT></STRONG>"

"event","i feel so bad for freddy. his parents took his car, his house key and his next 3 pay checks away from him. hes alomst 19 and cant do shity about it!. how fucked up is that? yes he deserves some of the punishment do to the party he had while his parents were out of town but thats a little harsh. the reason hes in trouble is because he let people in the house and stupid shit happend. this girl was sitting on the stove and her big ass broke the oven door. then someone carved into his moms coffee table with a pen. so yes if i were freddys parents i would be a little pissed to, but damn thats a little much i think. i love freddy but he isnt always the brightest crayon in the box. but ill do anything to help him and be there for him because im hid girlfriend and im there for him just like he is for me. so just like any other problem, we'll work through it and be fine."

"event","When you're lying all alone
just breathing in the dark
and you feel like you can't get enough air

When it feels like you're being crushed 
by a tired heavy heart
and it seems like real company is rare

! I'll be the one to kiss you
C! The kiss that brings you back to life
H! I'll be the one to save you
O! Like me you've saved me so many times 
R! But if there is one thing
U! Baby you should know 
S! That without you
! I'd still be a lost soul

When you wake up honestly still dreaming
and there's that throbbing in your chest
you find yourself really wanting those lips

Just know that I'll come running
and I'll try to do my best
all to bring you that life saving kiss

[jaded_doll_17] Stop hurting me.
She watched life pass her by
She kept the hate inside
She caught the tears that fell down
Put them in a jar and drowned
In self pity and denial
Alcohol takes it away for a while
She sees the faces as they stare
Impassive, empty, devoid of care
Her fate, unimportant to unseeing eyes
Their words through cracked lips: lies
She walks among the fakest crowd
Thinking hate with the music loud
Headphones blast the pain away
No longer hear the words they say
Its all just lies anyway
Cut you to pieces by the end of the day
Her head clouded its hard to see
She says her anthem ""Stop hurting me""
Feet shuffle, walk on through the stream
Of people too self occupied to hear her scream
""FUCK YOUR LIES, FUCK YOUR HEART
FAKE AND EMPTY, IT RIPS ME APART
HOW MANY FAKE SMILES CAN YOU MAKE
IN THE END ALL THE FACADES WILL BREAK""
Neverending smiles all around
She screams and screams, still no sound
Life's too short, life's too jaded
She's the key to all she's hated
At home that night she's still screaming
As he yells she prays she's dreaming
He finally leaves, she falls to the ground
Nobody left to bring her around
Thinking of the pain and how it kills
She gets out the bottle and swallows the pills
The alcohol numbs, the pills set her free
She screams her anthem ""Stop hurting me"" 
Dying still without a sound
Broken heart ceases to pound"

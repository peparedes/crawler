"event","the new york times is doing this thing where everyday they give you another chapter of a book, and by the end of the week you've read the whole book.  this week its the great gatsby.  how cool is that?  you get to read these books for free, without crazy librarians threatening you, and they get delivered to your house everyday and its just beautiful.  
i should drink with megan more often.  its very laid back, rather than frantic and wild, which is what i am used to.  
in three days at the end of next week, i'm going to make more than what i would make in 2 weeks at camp.  
if you can count on paul to do anything, it's to be late.  my mother woke me up at 10:50 and she was like ""what time is paul supposed to get here?"" and i was like ""11"" and she was like ""ahhh! you'll never have time to get ready."" and i was like ""chill, man.""  now it is 12:01.  i have showered, dressed, played some bass, had a bite to eat....maybe he'll show up soon.  
yesterday i was in car service and when the guy pulled up, i was like, ""how much"" he said ""8 dollars"" and i was like, ""uh..."" but i started shifting around in my wallet.  and then he was like, ""ok, 7 dollars is fine""  i was like ""OK!"" and gave him 7 dollars and left.  8 dollars from megan's house to mine? i don't think so."

is it wrong to feel just a little flattered when random guys hit on you in the street?  i mean, it's not like bay ridge is a bad area, so the guys can't be that dirty, right?  it just builds my confidence, ok!

"event","so i woke up today and went downstairs, and there was my long-lost sister, back from hawaii.  i cancelled my plans, because my parents thought it would be best if i spent quality time with her, but then she smoked a cigarette and slept for the rest of the day.  oh well.  weird things about hope:
1- she adds an extra sound to the word ""no""
2- her hair is kind of blond
3- her hair is half straight and half curly
4- refers to her boyfriend as ""shrek""
5- still thinks paul's in love with me and i hate him
6- constantly says ""you're so skinny!""
7- doesn't eat carbs
got really drunk with greg yesterday and had a long talk about circumscision (sp?).  then he told me he never really liked me, which brings the total number of guys who really liked me down to...hmm...One.  and that's the one who hates me half the time.  
i could finally listen to mxpx today.  haven't been able to listen to them in months, don't know why.  listened to green day too, which i haven't done in a long time.  learned how to play ""when i come around"" on the bass.  exciting. however, i'm still tone deaf.  don't tell paul.  
oh, so prom.  yeah, that was a few days ago, but i can still talk about it.  yeah prom was good, the limo ride there was awesome, because of my excellent music, paul was crazy to dance with (everyone was jealous, of course....ha), and he wore a crazy green tux to match my dress, and we took pics with ms.close because she's so cool, dj sucked though, and we missed ice cream, and after party was terrible and not enough alcohol, so we left early, after tearing paul astuto away from the dance floor, ate breakfast, slept at nick's, which was nice until it was 10 in the morning and nick started drinking again.  sometimes i worry about nick.  he called me today and our conversation was like this:
""hey so i was just thinking about how crazy it was yesterday""
""uh, yeah""
""wasn't it crazy?""
""yeah, it was crazy, nick""
""because justin was telling me how i was chugging the whiskey and like three people were trying to wrestle it away from me...""
""yeah""
""so what are you doing today?""
""i might hang out with megan""
""oh, yeah, i'm busy-- i'm gonna finish all my work today""
""oh, ok""
""well, uh, bye""
""bye nick""
sometimes i feel bad for nick.  sometimes i think about what an idiot he is.  sometimes i think about how easy it will be to avoid him now that school is over.  sigh."

in other other news, i have a genetics research paper to do.  however, i am finished with writing for the year after that bitch ass portfolio that almost ate me alive.  i have no desire to start this paper, which is due the day after memorial day.  but i really really want to party like an animal all memorial day, which means i have to get this paper done before then.  what a bitch.
i have to think of something to write my novel about.  i'm sick of sex and catholic school.  what else is there to write about?  please! help me!
megan, that letter was the most pain in the ass thing to read, i never think i will be the same.  there was no order, i was flipping the thing over and going upside-down, and i had no idea what the fuck was going on.  it was quite frustrating.
i have to find a place to party like an animal this weekend.  that will be a problem.  i also need a place for after prom, but helena has warmed up to the idea of after-promming with me, which is excellent.  i love my helena.  today we played knock hockey and i fell asleep in the grass and her friend  put grass on me, and she wore old chinese man sunglasses.  she is so cool and sexy, and also asian.  which i tend to forget.
now maybe homework.  maybe sleep.  my fucking sister ate all the nutter butters.  either that or she hid them.  its not fair, she caN BE so cool and then she fucks it up by taking my nutter butters.  oh peanut-buttery sweetness, how i miss you."

apparently pete is a some kind of diety, because paul does whatever pete tells him to.  this week pete told paul that he shouldn't be with me in college, so paul told me he couldn't be with me in college.  apparently this is suppose to ""save our relationship.""  i don't know what that means, i don't know what goes on that curly-head of his, but whatever, its for the best and i'm over it anyway.  prom, fuck it.  i'm sick of hearing about prom.  even my mother talks about prom.  all the time, too, that's why i just go to sleep when i get home.  today she said she missed having me at dinner, because i've been sleeping through it, so today i ate dinner with her, and now i can't fall asleep.  
i hate the end of this year.  this happened in 8th grade too- i feel like i have no friends, that i'm already gone.  bye bye.  everything feels fake, i feel like everyone changed and no one's the person i used to be friends with.  does that make sense?

"event","i found a song called ""i got laid on james joyce's grade.""  ingenious.
ok, about this whole prom thing.  i was upset, but now i'm like, fuck it, because i don't give a shit what we do before or after, we're gonna rock the prom and everyone's gonna wanna be me.  and i'm so fucking lucky because i have paul, and even if we just go to mcdonalds after prom, i'll be happy to be with him.  and even the people with big parties and party buses aren't that lucky.  so fuck them, i'm better than everyone."

"event","so yeah, no attention span today.  i was like ooh! maybe i should try to pass genetics!  oh! crazy ukranian in bright orange book!  oooh! the MUPPETS!!! so yes, now i'm at the muppets. i'm listening to kermit the frog sing and strum on his little banjo.  i used to be upset that i have to do a waltz as my final project in ballroom.  now i'm happy, because no one else is cool enough to dance to kermit.  oh man!  maybe i can get my partner to dress all in green!  oh, poor little asian boy.  
everyday i have the same conversation with my little asian partner:
""hey, so 'no one else' is a waltz.  its by weezer, do you know it?""
""weezer, who's that?""
""uuuugh""
(except fill in any band/singer that is good instead of weezer, because its a new one everyday.)
so i was rejected by all my friends in terms of prom shit.  they don't want to hang out with me before prom, or after prom, or on the way to the prom.  very sad.  i was upset.  megan made me more upset because she is selling my second home and i will have no place to get food on the way home from school.
but then i found kermit.  sigh of happiness.
god, i'm so spaced out."

"event","i am in one of my pathetic moods.  i'm going to have the shittiest time with trains and buses and BAYSIDE tomorrow.  this bullshit is too much for me, i am choking on it.  then look at me fucking dance around for like 5 minutes then travel another 12 hours to get back home.  waste of a perfectly good fucking weekend.  the waiter in the restaurant just kept pouring me more and more wine tonight.  i mean, i look like i'm 12, what was he thinking? but hey, i'm not complaining.  i'm fucking tired though and pathetic, definitely pathetic.  too tired, have to sleep.  
nick just drinks all the time, i'm starting to worry about him.  he makes me want to go sober for the rest of my life, to balance him out or something.  its weird, one of my other friends is an actual alcoholic and he had to stop drinking.  its weird because we always used to look up to him and party with him and stuff.  and then i guess it just got carried away but now we can't even party with him.  not that i've been to a party in months, stupid mother.  and my dance recital is the same night as my prom.  some luck i have.
but now i'm too tired, i must go to bed.  i should start sleeping with a stuffed animal, i've been feeling lonely in bed lately."

"event","i have no idea how the fuck to use this thing.
and i'm not sure if having a live journal makes me cool or more of a loser.  ah well.  lets start:
every day in government i want to kick someone's ass.  then in fiction writing i want to kick another person's ass.  very frustrating.
went to paul's house after school for some paul lovin', and i found him in his kitchen boiling water to make me pasta.  very tasty.  then he burned me a massive mp3 cd with (pause here for a moment of understanding beth's frustration and desire to beat someone up.  ""Nighty Night""- who the FUCK says nighty night?  WHat are we in, kindergarten?  FUCK YOU.  sigh.  much better.  anyway) with inspection 12, weezer, smashing pumpkins, jimmy eat world, all that good stuff.  AND 
TOMORROW IS BEN AND JERRY'S FREE CONE DAY!!!!!
it is a very exciting week. 
ok, i've wasted enough time for today."

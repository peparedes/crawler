 Heres some of the random shit i was gonna put in here.  Interestingly i noticed the only entry I had made in 2007 was also the first entry of 2007, i found it humerous.  (remember the other two had been hacked but idk i feel as though i should leave them for some reason).
okay so aaron has drastically improved my mood.  we just sat back and talked about a lot of random stuff. it was wicked awesome!! there is more fucked up stuff going on that i hadnt realized which pisses me off but getting a chance to talk was just fabulous. so yeah im gonna go while im still on a high!! 

love ya all

So bet you all thought i forgot i even had one of these. some randomness the last couple entries i didnt post...someone apprently hacked my account or somethin which is upsetting but anyways i changed the password so all should be well again. Hmm i dont even know im explaining any of this cause the truth is no one uses livejournal anymore so i know no one is even going to see this update.  grrr i never liked writing if no one was goin to read/comment on my entry. although i guess what this comes down to is im thinkin of typin in here again for my own selfish benefits which are idk i liked writing in this before and hope i can start up again.  it was soothing.  argh so much time has passed since my last real entry there is so much i would have to go over. ill probably just skip it all and bust right into the here and now. if anyone does read this im sure youll b bright enough to figure out whats going on.  well its been fun to just ramble a bit but i probably should get some sleep, gotta get up early for class you know ;-) hehe.

catch ya laters,
Scotty"

      Hi everyone!! Remember me? Its Scotty G! Anyways im bored and procrastinating cause ive got a history mid-term tomarrow which conviently is our first grade and im kinda psyched out. ill study later, ive got more important things to do like update my journal for the first time in roughly 3 years. thats called an exageration for those that didnt catch on...its been a long time.. right so back to my fabulous entry. i kno i have u wrapped w/ enthusiasm w/ what ill write next. ur all enthralled in my entry which is great cause i havnt actually ""written"" anything. ill start off by telling yall that have once again have gotten a job. yeeeehaaaaaww!! im just a workin machine...well i work once a week... but then again its me so b proud! ummmm what to write ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm heather is ridiculously cute! well hmmm i just got back from dinner so im feelin quite content. school is goin pretty quick im doin decent i should b doin better but i had to become death for one of my tests which killed me... poor scotty. man these damn things r harder than i remember, probably y i stopped writting these. ohhh i know i got new shoes which makes me angry cause theyre obnoxiously bright and new but i can go out in the rain again so no more flooded shoes for me!! Space Ghost Coast to Coast made it on the top 25 animated shows. such a good talk show they should definatly bring that back....YANKEES LOST WOOOOOO GO BINGE!! damn its been months and i still have nothing to write about... good thing ive had years of bullshittin written pieces throughout highschool. oh last weekend i saw lindseys family at bill grays, geez i see my friends families more than i see my friends! lalalalala i love cows lalalalala mmm-mmm good. four day weekend comin up, ill probably have no life for most of it...except for sunday which im busy all day....STEFS BDAY whooooha! i hear i may see some familiar faces! graced by my presence ya lucky bastards. ummm for anyone that wants to know, flogging molly is comin soon, i for one probably wont b goin since its like $25 or somethin outragous like that but for all u who like to throw ur money around thought id let yall kno. pretty sure its at water street also so check their website for details and such. no remember all you should go play guitar hero, i mean it must b amazing it has queen and freezepop, it makes me giddy just thinkin bout it...or is it gitty...im too lazy to use the dictionary so pick the correct one and insert it into my sentence. thanks
:-)
well this was painful. cant believe i was able to get a decent length outta this...HA noones gonna read this anyways. i just like wasting my time. u could prove me wrong and leave me lost of comments.... *hint hint wink wink*

Once a week, I know is gonna b tough but we'll see if i can pull through.  Well um lets see, this weekend i went to kennys, then um lets see uh then i went to kennys.  So why is it that in kennys journal hes bitchin bout people need to hang out w/ him and call him, i dont think anyone really knows! hahaha just kiddin kenny...pal...buddy. kennys consisted of the usual hyper madness as one would expect from going to kennys. matt and nick were there, use your imagination. *cough mayhem* OHHHHHHH!!! sunday me and heather started on the campaign of bringing down walmart!! it was a glorious moment and it helped in the playing of freezepop! drinks all round! so today i really miss the taurus!! it was such a beautiful car. speaking of which pete's journal has an amazing picture of her on her last voyage! be sure to check it out. in fact his entrys probably better than mine so get outta here and check it out!!

Today Heather and I celebrated a year of being together. I couldn't be happier!! So I started the day waking up bright and early to play two soccer games. Both of which we lost, which is no suprise and I think i got sunburned as well, how unfortunate. Anyways after this my day started looking up because i made myself a peanutbutter and jelly sandwich. It was mighty delicious. After my quick lunch i scurried over to see my favourite person! That put me in an amazingly awesome mood! We roamed the beach, then went on a boat. Felt so good out on the water compared to the crazy heat and it was quite relaxing lounging and chatting w/ heather, especially after playing soccer all morning. We got some dinner and there was crazy asian gatherings, many for heather to choose from haha! After that i took heather home, then read for the rest of the night. So looking back, the day was fabulous!! 
Well thats my update, hope ya'll liked it cause i dont plan on updating for awhile now.

well well well. guess what people, i graduated!! i know it was a little uncertain at times but its true...slacking really can get you through life!! anyways yesterday at the eastman seeing everyone one last time, im not gonna lie it made me quite sad. hey hey dont worry i wasnt balling or anything geez, just a little sad on the inside ya know. what made me feel good though was not only did i see seniors, but also some underclassmen i knew too. well, sarah drake, nicole, and of course heather since i brought her hahaha. moving along to the ceromony i was dancing around waiting to b seated and sean saw me and got a kick out of it so he took some pictures of my awesome self!! my hair was fabulous the way it was busting out from under my cap!! right so i sat next to kate and we had a grand ol time. she has to b the most sarcastic person i know!! oh man how im gonna miss her!! our combined sarcasim was at an all time high yesterday too since she kept skipping advisement, this was the first time i really talked to her all year! right so u know id talk bout the rest of the ceromony, but the majority of u people reading this were probably there so yea.  i got my picture taken like eight million thousand times because im hot in general, but in a graduation gown well...theres no compare:-) hahahaha. afterwards we dropped off heather, and went out for a graduation/fathers day early dinner thing! went to dinosaur barbaque which was my first time, and oh man it was soo freakin delicious. i wish i could eat there everyday. what made it better is i was soo hungary going in there too!! DELICOUS!! later on went to kennys, but the crew wasnt there so i talked to kennys parents, and pictures and such, met up w/ everyone and star gazed! i love star gazing, yesterday was the perfect night for it, i just wish i coulda been in the country or somethin, cause the lights definatly clouds the sky!!

well i guess thats about it!! maybe ill routinly update now, dont count on it!! have fun everyone Congradulations class of 2005 ill miss ya!

so yeah i havnt updated in a few weeks and i really should be doing homework right now but nah thats not happening. instead of being bored i thought ""im gonna make everyones day just a little better and update my journal."" cause u know everyone is so intrested in my life and have been complaining for an update...hahahahaha yeah right. actually the truth is i was lookin over my last entry and it occured to me that thats the most comments ive ever recieved in all my entrys!! and then i noticed it was all about my car...you bastards love my car more than me!! so really im writing this entry to spite you all, cause i know you have nothing better to do than read my journal, and i love wasting your time hahaha

okay so um, if anyone is actually still reading this i was just kidding before, i dont really hate you. sigh im not gonna have any friends after this entry...at least i was laughing the whole time i was writing!

alright so heres the real journal entry if anyone still cares hehe. friday i had gone to the penny w/ lindsey and pete for a decent show. i was psyched since its my first show in quite the while. stealing roses amazing!! bought there cd, the next band okay kinda silversteinish i wasnt expecting so much screaming at the show though. unfortunatly due to the penny starting an hour and a half late, we didnt have time to see the headliner dspell. but i did get a free cd from them so im happy, got two cheap cds. first cds ive gotten all year!! after the show i visted heather for 5 minutes but she passed out and doesnt remember i was there hahaha

saturday, was very productive. organized my college junk and stuff like that. bought some filing boxes and such, basically trying to get my life all nice and orderly for college. had dinner w/ the family, but i was angery cause i didnt get my salad i was supposed to get w/ my spaghetti. poor deprived, hungary me. afterwards a group of us got together at kennys and hung out. (hung out=eating all his food which is supposed to last him the week!!) :-)

Sunday!!! definatly my best day of the weekend! started off going to vince's w/ mark and filming half of our totally rad movie! oh i almost forgot but vince has the most amazing kettle ever...its a cow!! and it whistles!! hahahaha later we had a sing along and then relished in playing sega wooo!! i took mark home and he lives 30 seconds away from heather :-) (obviously i wouldnt have made a point of this unless i went to heathers after dropping him off.) so moving along i went to heathers after dropping him off hehehe!! without a doubt, i had a spectacular time! we started planning out the details for the tea room and well all that planning gave us a craving for tea. so we went and got ti chai tea and brought it back to the tea room so u know, it could actually b called a tea room. now ive never had this type of tea b4. it was pretty good, although i like my hot chocolate better but it still wasnt bad! then afterwords we cuddled...with georgie, cause hes super fluffy...we took turns hahaha

in conclusion sunday was the highlight of my weekend! u know what could make a monday morning really stellar!? leaving me at least nine comments so i feel loved. ill even except multiple comments from the same person, thats okay just more than eight thats all i ask!!

ill cya all in roughly 30 minutes byes!

The 1991 Ford Taurus Station Wagon (Shag'n Wagon, The Bull) is basically dead. I will no longer be driving the wagon anymore but instead ill b driving the crown victoria. I am really sad right now, i seriously feel like im bout to cry. I have soooo many memories linked to that car, as im sure most of you probably do too. shes been real good to me, and has definatly saved me on more than one occasion. she was unique and well known, basically everyone knew of my car. we went through some stressful times together but she never let me down. she was there for some of the best times of my life, she treated me real well. i wasnt ready for the good times with the taurus to end so soon. i didnt think that yesterday was the last time id ever drive the Ford Taurus. 

for this next part im gonna list some memories ive had with the Shag'n Wagon
(i may add more in the entry after this one):

~the phonebook night with the sawyers, tudisco, and pat
~leaving my keys in the car at pitsford and having to pick the lock to get them back
~that horrible night where i almost died 48 times because of the snow
~pimpin it out and getting the ladies w/ the wagon. got my first girlfriend with her! course now heather's gonna dump me cause i dont have a hot car anymore :-(
~the bouncy ball experiment
~laying on the roof looking at the stars with my favorite person
~the numerous drag races i won!
~putting the seats down and just chillin in the back w/ some friends
~eating out of the back of the Taurus
~heather driving! yikes!
~all the times i was shag'n in the wagon ;-)...oh wait that never happened
~backing into a brick wall
~my 18th birthday
~Timmy!!!
~the numerous things that didnt work in the car (i never did replace that lock...)
~driving ghetto
~constantly getting lost
~the last minute trips to warsaw
~the schemes created (operation break lindsey free) and the excuses i came up with (some of the more popular ones ""traffic was heavy"" ""there was an accident!"" ""the car wouldn't start"")
~the long talks that went down in The Bull
~learning how to multi task while driving basically being able kiss while driving with my thumb and not watching the road at all! (thats talent, not many can do that!!)
~starting at kodak, driving around with heather for 2 hours and somehow ended up at sawyers house while looking for a music store (still dont know how that happened!)
~and of course all those time where we all had nothing better to do but drive around!!

yeah there is a ton more that i could put in there but i got to leave some for you people add to. i expect a lot of comments on this entry! this is a tribute to the famous Shag'n Wagon!

Taurus Station Wagon, i will greatly miss you! I will always remember you and all the memories we've had! Its been fun, thanks for two of the most wonderful years of my life!

Goodbye Friend
~Love Scotty~"

okay so i was really sad today because i realized that returning pete's headphones left me headphoneless. i searched the house for some headphones that worked...and guess what i found. super old headphones from like the 70's!! no lie they're soo amazing too. the connection isnt the best but man they are so freakin comfortable. they are 83 million times better than the headphones of today! what u dont believe me!!? heres proof theyre brown ear pads w/ sliding (not clicking!!)adjustments and theres no L or R to guide u on how to put them on! yea see now-a-days we take stuff like that for granted. they didn't have such luxeries back in the day. U ACTUALLY HAD TO THINK B4 LISTENING TO MUSIC!! but anyways these headphones have made me quite happy cause now i can listen to my music again yay!!"

today things started to go downhill for me and i was starting to get depressed a little but then i hung out with sawyer, and my mood totally flipped!!! ill get back to that though.

school u kno was a pretty average day, had trouble staying awake and all, but i got through it. anyways after school i go and take heather home and heather being heather randomly took her keys and threw them at my windshield...and they tumbled down the little defroster vent in my car. now this vent is narrow and pressed right against my windshield, so nothing can really reach it. well i tried being cool and using a pen and pencil as chopsticks to fish the keys out since those were the only tools we had, but that was very unsuccessful. instead i drove over to kennys and took some plyers and a cooking fork and went back to work. with mine and kennys joint effort of using the plyers the fork AND the pencil all at once we finally retrived them!! all in all this took bout 45 min to get heathers keys.

so i go home work on some junk and heather tells me she cant hang out. that leave me with absolutly nothing to do, so i go about organizing my cds. that kept me busy for ohhh about 15 minutes, then i was bored again.  

TO SAWYERS!!!

I get to sawyers where i was disappointed to hear that they had steak without me, grilled right on the grill too!! we decided we needed to go to stutsmans (the guitar place that i dont kno how to spell) and get sawyer some picks. i didnt want to use the expressway though b/c it was rush hour and i noticed traffic wasnt moving. so we tried navigating through the city. MISTAKE we got hopelessly lost and lanes were blocked like crazy and i couldnt turn left (just like old times). a huge dilema indeed. finally found the expressway and started taking that when my car battery light turns on...yeah i was a bit worried, we were in the middle lane at rush hour on the expressway in the city. if we stalled...oh man. we made it to the guitar place alive. so sawyer bought his picks and we bought stale M&M's which were mighty delicious. we were hungary so we went to sawyers moms house and i raided his candy and we brought a bunch of food in my car (just like back in the day). it was then we agreed that it was time to go bother heather. we drove on over to her house and they were bout to have dinner so we stayed for like 5 min and got kicked out (reminds me of old times!). of course what other choice was there other than to follow the road...and the road always leads to the beach hahahaha. we hung out there for awhile and reminisced on the good times (sounds familiar yeah!?). we were going to go to the lighthouse and see if our marker was still there from last time but sawyer almost drown in a puddle so we ""TURN AROUND NOW"" Of course what way to end a spectacular night other than going to the mall (i love the old times!!). didnt see anyone we knew but just kinda did crazy stuff and had a blast! 

basically to sum up, somehow someway its always an adventure with sawyer!! were gonna revive the memories woooo!! oye i still dont have someone to walk round the block with till ten!!! hahahaha

yea so sawyers bout the only one who will fully and truly understand this entry, but it had to be written!!

Best friends means i pulled the trigger! hahahaa

ive just spent the last 20 minutes looking through my email account to figure out how to write an email. i dont know y i was doing this since i dont know anyones email address and well no one really knows mine, but if i ever did want to write one i thought it would be good to know how. sadly i still dont know how, i couldnt find the place im supposed to write the message in. its kinda sad how i know so little about computers, bout the only things i can use are IM, this journal (kinda), and word. anyways if ya wanna b a pal u can find me tomarrow and explain to me how to use this ""modern conveince"" it would b much appreciated.

on an off note thats one thing that makes Mr. Keck one of the best teachers ever...he hates computer as much if not more than i do!!

im done rambling maybe ill make a real update sometime soon.

cya later

didnt do much saturday till the night when i hung out w/ heather. it was awesome we laid on top of my car and looked at the stars. made up our own constelations and such hahaha if it wasnt for it being so extremly cold i coulda done that all night, oh well. we went back to her house and watched fantastic movies! flying snowmen wooo!! that night was purely spectacular! 

lets see sunday night i went playing in the snow with a bunch of people and that consisted of snowball fights and sledding. driving in that weather was crazy insane, it took me 4ever to get home but it was nice just kinda leisurely driving along. 

monday i spent all day working on my pig paper...well actually i procrastinated a lot but u know. everytime i got bored i bothered heather, im suprised she didnt kill me! hahaha she kept me sane though so it was all good. today i finished up my pig paper and powerpoint and went over heathers for a little bit. ive got to work on my economics paper tomarrow fun fun...another long day sigh

yesterday was such an awesome day, so here ill tell ya about it hehehe.

school was pretty much the same as usual, watched aaron eat hot peppers and then cheating by drinkin capachino afterwards hahahaha just kiddin. im gonna skip the school day since nothin happened other than me bein kinda stressed out from all the work i gotta get done argh. after school i hung out w/ heather till she had to go to math team, which by the way i am now also a part of now! im gonna really suck though cause i havnt actually done any math for like 2 years now hahahaa oh no. went home, that was uneventful worked on homework and such. later heather called me to go get her, if u can call it a real call it was more like randomn heather sounds then uncontrolled giggling! but i got the idea hahahaha. so i get there and crazy flick was there and was like eyeing me all scary like i was a little creeped out so i scurried by as fast as i could. we found out the scores then we headed off. so were drivin down ridge when we find this awesome little irish store, obviously we had to check it out! it had some really awesome amazing stuff in there, heather found this fabulous Scottish Gibson keychain which i ended up getting. i found my family tartan in one of the scottish books! oh and we found a book all about heather! hahahaha okay so maybe it was the heather flower buts its title was all ""Heather the beauty of Scotland"" it was great, its like the country's flower or somethin! they had a fabulous sign on the window sayin ""Come on ya little leprechauns we need some help apply today!"" i almost died and was thinkin bout getting an application, but the lady really freaked me out there i dont think i could handle that. she stared at us the entire time we were there and it made me really uncomfrotable. i dont know what the whole deal was today, but alot of people stared at me today and it really bugged me. so anyways we looked at the time and decided it was time for us to go bother kenny which we did successfully, and then we watched gremlins! havnt seen that in 4ever! basically after that i took heather and lindsey home and stayed over kennys a little longer. i destroyed him in foozball and had some food of course hahahaha and that was pretty much my day.

i really gotta get a workin on my homework oye

yeah this entry is gonna b a lot of ranting and complaining, so if u hate hearing bout that stuff u might wanna stop reading now. ive been hangin out w/ peoples a lot recently and thats been pretty good, got to see heather lots more than usual so of course that makes me super happy. 

alright now for the madness. lately everyone for the most part have been havin some really sucky days. a bundle of me friends have been sad/depressed/stressed/pissed off lately, and i feel really bad cause i havnt been much help lately...sorry all. as for school yea i got that damn pig paper i should b doin but ive procrastinated like crazy and done jack shit. my teachers gonna review our papers tomarrow so i gotta bust my ass and get somethin, now mind u ive literally done nothin on it. course thats not all im super behind in accounting which i didnt get a chance to fully catch up on over the weekend and ive got my economics final project which shouldnt b too hard but i need to get like a perfect on b/c i was stupid and didnt do a huge fucking project b4 break. yea wasnt a good weekend for me to away in buffalo, which i got back late from anyways argh. 

to top it all off my friend kelly who was kicked out and forced to move, is not coming back to new york like she was supposed to. its sucks how people r soo fucking evil, if i could id give her a place to stay. ahhh she was like the only person i talked to in like all my classes, now ive got no one in my second semster courses either damn it. at least she'll come back and graduate w/ us! i give kelly a lot of credit cause shes been through hell.

okay im done for now, im gonna try and drown myself in music

yesterday was a pretty good day for the most part! i got to hang out w/ heather throughout lunch and she was doin awesomely spectacular dances which made me very happy! right after school me, heather, sawyer, kenny, and pete all went to kennys house where I ate and we all hung out and watched movies. we picked up lindsey then all went back to kennys where we spent the majority of the rest of the night dancing, singin and eatin some mac and cheese! everyone was disappointed cause i didnt know the words very well to most the songs so i didnt really sing along hahaha. we all piled into my car and i took everyone home. i ended the night on the phone w/ the fabulous heather
:-)...was havin a fun conversation to until my mom yelled at me to get off the phone ahahaha


this morning has kinda sucked though, i have a feeling its gonna b a long day
i think too much...ill cya laters

half the break i decided to take some time to myself and just relax. so not much happenin there other than eatin and sleepin. tuesday night heather was ""deathly sick"" so i went and visited her for a little bit. got me a high quality spongebob watch straight from the apple jacks box! wednesday afternoon my plans fell through so i ended up spending the day watchin me new smashing pumkins dvd and some taking back sunday dvds. have no idea how much i want the real Taking Back Sunday to come back together, oh man i miss them! right so night time i got kenny and went to stefs for the napolian dynomite shindig w/ cheeseburgers, cameras and ketchup hahahaah. Thursday rolled around finally gave her her presents which i think she liked, either that or she could sign up for the play. i ventured over to kennys afterwards where constantly use his dart board. its soo much fun u have no idea. after realizing how bored we decided to get as many people as we could to kennys. so we got heather, pete, and lindsey. course heather had to leave practically once she got there which made me sad. but the rest of us went to piazza's and had a grand time sittin at the beach w/ the taurus tellin some tales hahahaha. of course we also did the waynes world Bohemian Rhapsody! to end the night me and kenny went back to his house and played some foozball w/ sean and matt while sean told some of his pitting stories. definatly one of the best days ive had in a long time! friday was new years eve saw saywer for the first time in forever, we and bunch of peoples all hung out at aarons for the day basically. at night kenny and i went to lindseys to spend the new years w/ lindsey (obviously), pete, lexy, and bridgit (i think thats her name and sorry i probably murdered the spelling). found out that apprently im tone deaf pshh i dont believe it though! lots of food for scotty to eat :-). i won at everything that night and of course won the rights to snazzy (again)! another good night. went back to kennys afterwords and spent the night. saturday went to kennys again during the night. the sawyers and josh all hang out and lots of awesomeness that u would have to b there to understand. lets say i was laughin the whole night. then round 1ish me and kenny went to heathers and dyed kennys hair and watched parts of forest gump hehehe. that brings me to today where i have done nothin all day. overall i had a very good Christmas break so im happy! im sure ur all aware we have school tomarrow...sigh im gonna b dead tired i know it.

well ive rambled enough for awhile, have fun

I got a free bagel from pete today (made by the ramen chef himself!) for driving him to work, heather ate half of it but it was still mighty delicous haha 
In the soccer part of my life im horribly out of shape but the spectacular Kevin Conner is on the team!! maybe he'll make me another delicous steak yummy yummy.

Anyways see if you can name the song (and the band that plays it) im bout to put in here, its one of me favs but theres one catch...NO CHEATING that means no lookin it up online!

Alright here it is:


The grass stands tall 
this darkness captivates me 
this field lasts for miles and I can't see the end 
I can't walk anymore 
I think I'll sit here and just die 

And I'll stare up at the stars 
and wish my wish that wont come true 
and throw my hands up high 
tell me am I your lost wish too? 
And I'll stare up at the stars 
and wish my wish that wont come true 
am I your lost wish too? 

How can I get your attention 
maybe if I shoot bulletholes through my hands and feet 
well maybe then you'll notice me 
I'll be the guy smiling with the bloody teeth 

And I'll stare up at the stars 
and wish my wish that wont come true 
and throw my hands up high 
tell me am I your lost wish too? 
And I'll stare up at the stars 
and wish my wish that wont come true 
am I your lost wish too? 

Bugs crawling through my hair 
the earth takes me in 
I'm inprisoned here forever forever and ever 

And I'll stare up at the stars 
and wish my wish that wont come true 
and throw my hands up high 
tell me am I your lost wish too? 
And I'll stare up at the stars 
and wish my wish that wont come true 
am I your lost wish too?


Yup so thats the song, good luck to all ya's

yeah i have been fighting boredom pretty much the entire weekend, at let me say that it gets boring fast. i need a hobby or somethin, aye mai feel free to give me some ideas and such.

alright so friday, me heather and kenny went to liz's get together for her birthday. didnt kno any of the peoples but it was still a pretty good time, god amounts of food :-). we watched saved which i struggled to stay awake for, anyways we left and went to kennys...and well yea, so we went to heathers instead for a little bit. after kenny finished his calls me and him went over to roots where we stayed the night.

saturday rolled around in which i got like only four hours of sleep, i dont really kno y truthfully. after tormenting kenny to wake up kinda i went home. once there i proceded to b bored for most of the rest of the day. took a light nap and did nothin pretty much. decided it was a good time to show up at ryans, now thinkin since i was comin nice and late everyone would b there already...guess not. matt, rosillio and zac were the only peoples there. i got bored again so decided to go find kenny and aaron. get to roots to find them all sittin around. i complained a bit hahaha then gave them all a ride over. (them all being kenny, aaron, matthew hahaha, and nick) we got back for like 5 min till someone decided that i was gonna drive peoples to wegmans for food. w/ a big sigh i agreed. things got...intresting. saw drake and i knew how happy he would b to see me i walked over to said hi, while goin over three little girls were sayin ""oooo nice scarf"" scotty:""yea i kno"" and i started to ignore them, didnt think too much of it. well i walked around and found kenny and them...and to my suprise i turn around and find the little 6th graders were following me...it just went downhill from there. the little tykes kept stalkin us. for sixth graders they definatly had some pretty sick minds...oh no. thankfully me nick and aaron sneaked away leavin kenny w/ the lot of them. walked over to me car and found kenny waitin for us...alone!! finally it was over. by the way if ya wanna hear the whole story talk to me cause theres no way i was gonna write every crazy thing in here oh my. we came back w/ our $30 worth of food and hung out. everyone was playin gamecube and i got really bored so hung out w/ rosillio a lot of the time. it took some crazy madness using microwaves from the year 1910 but were were able to make a wicked good mac and cheese hahaha. the night consisted of watchin cops (one of the most hillarious shows ever made), getting locked in the basement and tryin to get matthew out the door. the kid is crazy strong, me, rosillio, kenny, and aaron could not get him outside, he flails like no other! so yeah i left round 11.30 since most of the food was eatin and i was gettin quite sleepy.

yeah i couldve written that a little more exciting like but im too lazy to go and make it intrestin, so get over it!

thats all i got, cya laters

i woke up not too long ago, which means i havnt moved much today. a little stiff and groggy. anyways ur probably all wondering y im updating so soon after my recent entry, well its because of popular demand *cough one person*...what can i say ya all love me! 

okay well my life is incredibly boring so im gonna have to really strain for any little thing to talk bout it. yeah so today randomly a stake the size of my freakin hand got stuck in my thumb. yeah it hurts to type, thats how devoted i am to u, my fans! for the past two days ive been goin to school naked...well without a scarf that is. people have been worried about what happened to it. geez i mean i could see the tears form in their eyes when i told them its in need of fixing! i almost cryed when i spelled quiet wrong, quite! ahhh what the hells wrong w/ me, i wouldnt care but i usually flip on people that get those two words mixed up. i was very ashamed.

okay im suprised i got that much outta this entry, lots of well strectching the truth, but the main ideas r all true!!

to sum it up here, my cd player sucks i need a new one and santa's elves r really asain children oh no.

Thanksgiving, what else is there to say other than i ate my self to sleep! oh yeah definatly a good day, however i did get a might bit angry when i heard Christmas carols on the radio. i was definatly goin a little crazy bout that as im sure u can all imagine.

Friday i woke up waaay to early...i really dont know why that keeps happening, especially since im usually still tired oh well. so i tried waiting as long as i could to call heather but i got extremely bored and woke her up (oh my sorry). so after watchin the end of Wayne's World and letting the snow melt off my car i hung out with heather. definatly a marvolous time except for the creepy leaf um well we dont kno if it was a man or woman um i guess we'll say individual (it!!), and when the construction shovel almost killed us all...but otherwise it was marvolous hahaha. 

Got home and finally talked to ronnie for the first time in 4ever. for once we were both not doin anythin so we went off to the coffee shop like planned. chatted for a bit then off to billiards, where i must say i dominated hahaha well maybe got lucky...but i did win!! :-) so then we thought hey lets relive the good old days and went to laser tag woooo. like usual i came in like last...and of course i got lost trying to find the way out too. at least i didnt freak out this time haha. hmmmmm Irish Dancers! so we went to the theater to see what movie we could catch and to our luck (or maybe just mine) spongebob was bout to start! i was overwhelmed w/ happiness! sat down and noticed we were the only two people in the show so we could b as loud as we wanted wooooo! the movie itself, well lets just say maybe spongebob is better in 30 minute incramints, i was a little disappointed...anyways i just got home and apprently my dad deleted all the messages i had, so if ya left me any messages after 8.30ish sorry but i didnt see any of them...

well thats all i can think of ill cya all laters

alright well lets see. i guess i said i was gonna talk bout the rest of me bday, but u kno it was a long time ago and im really kinda too lazy to write bout it. so heres the quick version. pete and lindsey were already w/ me, picked up kenny, then heather, then talked to eric, then picked up steph, cruised around and hung out and such, got pizza made messes and that was basically my birthday. i hope u enjoyed.

right so now recent events! i kno ur all jumpin w/ glee. yesterday was a fabulous day, filled w/ much randomness, laughs and adventure. it all started at sawyers where we were hangin out and not being able to think of anything to do. we ended up sittin round watchin tv, listenin to music which was very relaxing. we decided to go get lives after eating some pizza, but then malcolm called so we went to pick him up first. being the losers like we are we ended up at the mall, oh my. now im just gonna list the rest cause it seems like a popular thing to do now!

found nick

played on excersize machines, got buff!

visited janette

need to cash in my free dinner at charbroil :-)

looked at cds

ditched nick and malcolm (u dont wanna kno y)

almost ran over nick by dick's

ran over malcolm by target

after sawyer and i got tired of watchin nick and malcolm futiley try and catch my car we picked them up

showed some hookers the moon

malcolm broke my door lock

much argueing and flipping out

after bout 30 min malcolm finally fixes the lock, but now its ghettified

drove in circles on the parkway

almost died a couple times

dropped everyone off

wow doing an entry like that makes it look like i did a lot! people might think ive got a life now! hahaha 
sawyer and i are hangin out a lot recently. its just like back in the day ah yes good times! if we keep hangin out like this we could b due for some more road trips and adventures like we used to do! and this year im not grounded so i dont have to sneak out all the time! hahaha

cruisin around w/ no destination, blastin music! oh yea sawyer were back!

alright well im basically trying to stay awake here so mhmmm okay. 
friday was indeed my birthday woooo go me! also means im another year older...oye. right but anyways i had school that day so i went to go pick up heather. i get there and heathers not quite ready so frannie made sure to tell me the importance of a coat hahaha. i also got to watch subtitled music videos...idk it just doesnt seem the same w/o actually hearing anything hehe. right so i got me awesome purple scarf which i started sporting right away. (everyone loves it i might add) phalen brought me in a gargantuan cake, which was very yummy. ya once the cake was whipped out i found out i have more friends than i thought, kinda made me want to know who they were. so i got my ""facefull"" of cake, almost died but the rest of the day was basically any typical day. finally school was over and i could go out and have a blast for my birthday! so i went to physics and did all the labs that were due 1st quarter, every...last...one. at least pete was there so he helped out. i eventually left school! the celeratiion began as we moseyed on over to petes. pete decided he was gonna cook my b-day dinner, RAMEN NOODLES! Beef Style of course :-) but of course we could get a cookin we had to get the goods, and obviously go pick up lindsey to have some of the birthday ramen! right so we got back to petes and watched fabulous live shows of queen, w/ freddy mercury ooolala. maury was on! so we watched that along w/ judge judy and the really freakish family w/ penciled eye brows *shudder* it still gives me the creeps. time to eat, oh man the birthday ramen was better than the regular ramen, it was divine mmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmm good. we had difficulties trying to think of stuff to do so we finally agreed to go bother janette at work...except she was sick so that didnt happen so we talked to her on the phone for a bit. after another long time of thinkin of what to do, we finally took action and went to kennys. and right now im out of time and have to go to school, so ill finish this up laters.

<P>Friday was both good and bad. Went to sawyers for the night which was an amazing time but ill get into that laters. friday was the last day i got to see kelly b4 she moved to Virginia. basically we became pretty good friends this year, shes in like every class w/ me, now shes gone and ive got no one in my classes!! well not really but its not gonna b the same!</P>
<P>sawyers shindig was definatly lots of spectacular fun. i picked up rosillio and kenny, and somehow were the first ones there. didnt see that coming thought we were gonna miss dinner and all that. a little while later pino showed up w/ aaron and matt. sawyer and matt played us w/ some tunes, they didnt sing any lyrics but i think they played amazing, if the rest of their band is as good as they r, then they have some real potential to get someplace w/ their band. we all moseyed over to walmart to buy us a football for laters. and yes of course we made a ruckus in walmart but nothin new there. i saw the Action Action cd which im really wanting right now! we played lots of football over the weekend w/ billy bob hahaha and lots of resinent evil which was just plain hillarious. had some pizza, donuts and crazy wrestling. no body can take me down!! unfortunatly i cant take anyone else down, oh well. </P>
<P>sunday was halloween of course which yes i am not too old to get some candy hahaha!! it was good times, we saw a bunch of peoples we knew while out. played lots of donky conga, getting lazy w/ my story cause i dont feel like typing anymore. eric almost blew up his hand and yeah. a major let down though is, unfortunatly i didnt make it to janettes like i had planned on doing...pete made sure to tell me everything i missed...i almost cried, do u know how much food i missed!!! and the cake oh man oh man it was glorious</P>
<P>senior skip day was monday...and i went to school!! yeah im a loser oh well nothin new there. wasnt as bad as i thought it woulda been though. suprising lot more people showed up than i had expected. physics fun as usual, PIG good times there was like 5 people we just talked bout music and movies and such then started watching Air Force One, advisement amazing like usual, math i made block people and showed him off while the seniors/juniors came out of lunch, they loved him :-) then i got sent to a corner cause its not allowed in school hahaha. during this time i borrowed chrisi's cell and called up kelly and see how she was doing. she was unpacking when i called, i made sure to tell her how much we missed her and how she needs to come back as soon as she can! the rest of the period i spent looking out the window trying to get the attention of the people across the courtyard in ms millers classroom. stupid blonde i swear she saw me but she ignored me or somethin i got angry, ask chrisi i put alot of effort trying to distract their class grrrrrr. the rest of the day was time as usual. i got to see Heather today!! i see her everyday but i felt like making note of it today cause shes soo much more stylish than i am! :-) hehehe</P>
<P>thats all i got, oh wait thats right i updated which means heather had better b finishing my scarf! haha</P>

Tuesday was senior day for soccer (last home game) so i got some good amount of playing time. we ended up winning 6-0 judah gettin a hat trick, and some goals from new peoples like maloni and cuomo iiaaeeeehhhhhh! i dont even know how to spell the famous cuomo sound...4got who the other person that scored was oh well. Wednesday heather wasnt in school, other than that i dont remember anything from that day...i wonder if i hit my head or somethin cause im drawin a total blank...oh wait!! i remember i saw the court case for PIG that day, seeing myself on camera i decided im gonna keep my hair length bout the length it is right now and if that camera acuratly records sound then i dont hate my voice as much! another observation, i can't sit still when people r watching me, i randomly laughed numerous times but it all looked good! after school i went to see how heather was doin. unfortunatly i had practice so i couldnt stay very long. oh yeah and georgie only purs when im around!! hahaha 
today was okay, the classes were alright. got 101 on the pacer, a personal best and i figured out my locker combination! lunch is sooooooooooooo boring i really gotta find somewhere to go that period hmmmmmmm. more bad news is that after school i realized that i didnt have my hoodie! im freakin out cause i wear that hoodie all the time...sigh im like positive i left it in accounting or advisement but i think someone picked it up...soccer game today, i played real well but of course we lose anyways cause we always lose to the worst teams. yeah so im a little annoyed w/ the loss, and now ive got a team meeting tomarrow right after school and then practice a basil oye. im still gonna miss soccer when the sean ends though....

scotts gonna have to be retro w/ the hoodies now

yes the title holds true! on saturday scotty got his first varsity start probably gonna b his only one but hey it felt good! of course being one of luck i started and sucked royaly oh well. i was put in at the end of the game since our entire team somehow got injured, or were fighting for the throne hahaha. anyways i did well, ended up gettin the worst rug burn of my life (played on turf) and got decked at full speed so that put me in a good mood
:-) i got more game time that day than i have all year!! 

the bus ride there and back was actually quite fun considering it was like 5 hours all together on the bus. got a free buffet meal too, yummy. got home at midnight that day, turned out to b better day than i thought it was goin to b. truthfully i think im gonna miss playin soccer sigh. 

hmmmm, i kno!

My tiger has got the sled,
And I have packed a snack.
We're all set for the trip ahead.
We're never coming back!

We're abondoning this life we've led!
So long, Mam and Pop!
We're sick of doing what you've said,
And now it's going to stop!

We're going where it snows all year,
Where life can have real meaning.
A place where we won't have to hear
""Your room could stand some cleaning.""

The Yukon is the place for us!
That's where we want to live.
Up there we'll get to yell and cuss,
And act real primitive.

We'll never have to go to school,
Forced into submission,
By monstrous, crabby teachers who'll
Make us learn addition.

We'll never have to clean a plate,
Of veggie glops and goos.
Messily we'll masticate,
Using any fork we choose!

The timber wolves will be our friends.
We'll stay up late and howl,
At the moon, till nighttime ends,
Before going on the prowl.

Oh, what a life! We cannot wait,
To be in that arctic land,
Where we'll be masters of our fate,
And lead a life that's grand!

No more of parental rules!
We're heading for some snow!
Good riddance to those grown-up ghouls!
We're leaving! Yukon Ho!

""The Yukon Song""

hahaha i bet noone knows what thats from!! well all of u except one person...and im sure that person isnt gonna tell anyone!! shhhhhhh

anyways im gonna go think of stuff i can do, make some future plans hmmmmm

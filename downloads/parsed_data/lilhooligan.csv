"event","Ok, can I just start by saying- Ben called! Ben called! Ben called! Ben called! (Hey, remind me to never give him the link to this journal. . .)  Anyways, I was starting to think that all of my friends back home had forgotten about me.  It was making me a bit depressed that I hadn't heard from certain people (can you guess who?), and I was hoping that I wasn't that easily forgotten about.  But now everything is much better and I can function knowing I was not forgotten about. 

It really dissapoints me in myself that I haven't written in this for a few days.  I wanted to do daily updates, but I started orientation and had so much other stuff on my mind that this just wasn't much of a priority anymore.  Orientation went fine, but I have a real distain for sitting in an auditorium listening to people preach for 8 hours a day.  On the plus side, I got to meet a ton of really cool people and got a feeling for what to expect over this next year.  There was a welcome speech and reception last night that was interesting (interesting= free alcohol), and a big party at a returning law students house because ""the 2nd years want to get the first years drunk"".  No objections coming from me!  Once again, I got to meet tons of cool people.  I think law school was a good choice for me socially just because there are a lot of people there that think a lot like I do.  Makes me wish I could've skipped high school and gone straight into law school.  There are people in my class from all 50 states and 4 other countries.  Needless to say, it makes for an interesting group of people.  There seem to be lot of choices of men too, but most are taken.  However, there is this one particular 2nd year that caught my attention, but I am going to skimp on those details until I figure out better what is going on with him.  

All in all, it is everything like Legally Blonde and nothing like it at all.  For example, my social events calendar was included in my orientation package.  So here we go:

Bruser the dog         -        C.C. the guniea pig
To smart to have personalities-  Too fun to not have personalities
4th grade geniuses     -        only one guy from Harvard, one guy from Princeton
And yes, you are expected to be have whole chapters read and outlined by the first day of class (I start class Monday, but had homework assigned to me this past Tuesday. . .figure that one out).

Goodnight everyone!  Miss you tons!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Ok, so I'm sitting here at my desk doing some work.  It is only orientation week, and I already have reading and briefs to do. . . Like the diligent student I am, I get straight to work writing the worst brief ever written by anyone, and wouldn't you know the first night of work I discover that the person in the apartment above me has their stereo system right above my desk.  For awhile it sounded like they were practicing their drums.

Registration went pretty well, but I was a little too overwhelmed to try to made conversation with any of my fellow law students.  Imagine that, something that actually distracts me from talking (yes Becca, it is possible, for only for short periods).  Then I went and bought the bookstore, which amazingly only cost me $600.  I had a backpack full, a canvas bag full slung over my shoulder, and another bag in the opposite hand.  I then took my great deals and stumbled down the sidewalk looking more drunk than I did all summer.  

On a more internal thinking note, I think they should have a handbook on things to do and not do when you're growing up.  You know the phrase of parents saying that there is no handbook on how to raise kids?  Well, growing up isn't any easier.  My personal advice- careful what you say because the parents will throw it back in your face for the rest of your life.  Everyone rememeber the phrase, ""Talk to the hand because the ears ain't listenin'""?? Well, I still get reminded of that one.  Then, when I was 16 I claimed that my parents were just trying to buy my love.  To this day, if they buy me anything worth over $10 they tell me that they are not ""buying my love, just making sure you're taken care of"".  Who knows?  Think the book would sell????????"

"event","Wish me luck, everyone!  I get to go register tomorrow, which means that I get to find out my schedule, meet people, and buy $400 in books that I will want to throw out the window every night...  Today was a fairly productive day.  I actually explored outside of the apartment complex for a little bit.  The girl that opened my bank account recommended a bar that I might like.  I will have to attach to someone at orientation and get them to go with me on Saturday night!  I also have come to the conclusion that I love living by myself.  No offense to the wonderful roommate I have had, but I spared them from seeing me walk around naked and I don't have to anymore.  I love being able to play my music all day, and I also love coming up from the gym all sweaty and stripping off my clothes and walking around.  To all of you who can, do it sometime!  It's really liberating! 

That's all for me.  Time to lay in bed and pretend that I'm going to get to sleep before 1am.  Cheers!"

"event","Well, I think I am slowly getting this live journal thing figured out.  I wish that people would write me, because right now I feel like I am wasting my time.  I really want to figure out how to do the emotions, they look like a lot of fun!  Tomorrow is my last day of freedom before the start of law school kicks in.  I do not actually start classes for another week, but having to register and commute in is enough responsibility for me.  

On a more personal note, I really feel like I am destined to stay single for the rest of my life.  I keep finding these guys that just really are not worth my time or effort.  It makes me wonder sometimes.  Especially when someone admits that they have been lying to you for over 5 months and they expect you to be fine with it.  I am thinking that the next guy I waste any time on I will let my friends pick out for me, because I apparently have very poor taste.  All I want is a little respect, uh, just a little bit.  R-E-S-P-E-C-T, tell you what it means to me!!!!!"

"event","Nothing interesting today.  I most did intervention all day with my parents and then had to go eat with my brother, his wife, and his in-laws.  I really wish I could have gone grocery shopping, though.  That is the problem with having guests- you are supposed to do what they want to do, even if you have a ton of other stuff to take care of.  Hopefully tomorrow will be more productive.  Night!"

"event","Today there wasn't a whole lot exciting going on.  I got woken up to very loud knocking on my door.  I then spent the next 4 hours assembling furniture.  Ate lunch.  Assembled more stuff.  Now I'm tired, but my apartment is most put together (thank God!).  

On the flip side, I think it is finally starting to hit me that I'm not in Indiana any more.  I want to go out with friends and sleep until 2 in the afternoon like I've been doing all summer.  It's actually a lot harder to adjust to than I thought it would be.  What I would give right now to go out...  I am definetely starting to feel the effects of having left my friends.  On the plus side, I hate the end of relationships.  Especially when they end badly.  Most of the time in my past, if I have lost a friend or significant other it was because we had a falling out.  It is kind of nice to have actually left most people on good terms and to be able to look foward to going back.  Right now I am looking at visiting either the middle or end of September, but I have to register for classes before I can say for sure.  Speaking of, time for me to get on the Catholic website and try to put my schedule together.  Yea, ha!  I miss everyone. . ."

"event","I am starting to look forward to a night when I can get home and not have to worry about the million and a half things I have to do.  Since I came out to DC without much furniture, I had to go buy it.  So today my mom and I went to a store called IKEA (basically a Target on crack- lots of furniture and all the house supplies you could ask for) and spent about 7 hours wandering around the store.  However, after a long day of trying to find what I like (and of course what matches), I got end tables, kitchen table, bar stools, a poster, wine glasses, a desk, and some other little stuff not worth mentioning.  I love my apartment, but it is seriously in need of some bright colors..."

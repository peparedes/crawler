I got real cupcakes (plain and chocolate) from my colleagues at work which was very thoughtful of them as I am veggie and egg free so they had to order them specially from the health food shop. None of them really ate any- so I had three yesterday, two this morning with fresh organic strawberries and blueberries and yummy fudge extra creamy yoghurt and I still have two left...

Having dinner with friends tonight. I got a very generous contribution to a new- second hand- car (Hyundai Matrix, airline seats, great visibility) from my mom (thanks).

However best pressie for a long time accolade also goes to my lovely colleagues who got me a year's pass to the Glasgow Film Theatre -free movies for a whole year! How cool is that?"

"event","So, the organisation I work for has been winning awards. Which led to our city newspaper, which is kind of the main quality newspaper in Scotland doing a piece on us. Which involved a picture...Oh noes!

Someone in the office took a team picture a while back. Lots of the team are good looking/ tall/ young/ glam. I was just trying to avoid having a double chin. Anyway in that attempt I thought:

 'if I look up and stick my chin out'.

 Except I ended up looking haughty and somewhat obnoxious. 

The picture promptly went around small local publications. Unfortunately the big daily newspaper also got hold of it. My day started yesterday with my boss coming in and proudly displaying the HUGE spread on us with the equally huge picture. Excuse me, does anyone have a spare rock I can crawl under?

This, unfortunately, is not the first time I have had my pic in the daily press. About a dozen years ago I was practicing criminal law. One of the court buildings in the area had been renovated and I was appearing there the day it opened. Shortly before I was due in court I went to the ladies. On attempting to leave I discovered the door knob for the exit wouldn't turn. I was trapped. 

I yelled and kicked and pounded on the door. Big heavy solid door in quiet corner. Nothing. I envisaged failing to appear, being released eventually and having to explain my non appearance to the judge in open court. Well you see m'lud, I was locked in the toilet. No. Way. 


What to do? I noticed the door knob was fixed with screws. I got out my metal nail file (which I always keep handy- actually it was a very small one, part of my nail clippers which I do always keep handy, as I hate ragged nails.) I managed to get the door knob off. Which I was then left standing with in my hand. Great plan, what next?

I figured if the mechanism was stiff hot water might loosen it. Filled a basin, plunged it in. Voila!, it turns. Re assembled the door knob, got out, dashed to court just in time for my case calling. Huge sigh of relief. 


Of course it being the first day of the new court building the press are sniffing around for an angle on the story, hitches, glitches, etc. Somehow they got hold of my tale of woe and phoned me up. They wanted to run the story but wanted a pic. No. Way. They said they would try to find a file pic and run the story anyway. I knew they wouldn't find one. They phoned again and offered money. Quite a lot actually for just having my picture taken. I relented.

Next day the story appeared with a smiling picture of me holding the nail file. What did I not do? I did not get editorial veto on the copy. What was the page three banner headline?

'Lawyer court with briefs down.'


Doh. 15 minutes of fame, anyone want mine?"

"event","Jack gets his sweet life with Ennis...late and unexpected.



The two old buddies lay next to each other on their recliners by the pool. This was a pretty cool old folks home. Or rather 'Senior citizens retirement complex'. Jack had been somewhat outraged when Bobby had shown him the brochure. His grey mustache bristled and his increasingly shaggy eyebrows didn't have to travel far to knit together. 

'So, ya putting me away finally, like a old horse that's no good for nuthin' no more.' 

Bobby rolled his eyes. Aw dad, c'mon, you know that's not true. With me and Ellie and the kids livin' in Florida now it makes sense for you to move close, and you know your rheumatics are much better in the Florida sunshine. You know you don't want to live with us, no matter how many times we say you won't be imposin'. Just look at the brochure OK? 

Jack had grumpily agreed and on flicking through he had to admit there were a few things that caught his eye. Them purty nurses (except a course they called them 'senior citizen facilitators' or some such nonsense.) He could think of a few things them healthy young bucks could 'facilitate' right enough, heh,heh. He thought with a sigh that that was about his only chance of gettin' any at this point. Forty odd years of meeting Ennis up in the mountains, and then as they got older and stiffer (in the less happy sense of that word) in motel rooms, had just about wore them both out. They were just as likely to drink some whiskey and fall asleep fully dressed on the bed in the latter days as they were to 'facilitate' anything.

A paragraph caught his eye. 'For those of our guests who like company and who wish to purchase a more economical package a number of double apartments are available. Two sharing can live for the price of one and a half singles fees'. A gleam came into Jack's eyes. He has never given up, never quit, on that sweet life with Ennis. Lately Ennis had seemed less worried about the two of them being together.  Seemed to figure no one would even think two old coots like them would be up to anything.  He thought that they were probably right most times. All that travellin' round to meet up plumb wore him out. A course he gave up them long drives a while back. Took an airplane lately, and with both a them more or less retired, and with Lureen gone they met up more frequent. Almost e'vry month or so, for a week. Jack could afford it. Still he wanted Ennis with him full time. Now was the time to strike.


Ennis hadn't taken the news of his move to Florida well.

'Whut in the hell ya wanna move ta Florida for at your age goddammit Jack, crazy sonofabitch,' etc etc had been his response. Then he chewed his lip and a worried look came into his eyes. 

'Uh, Bud, this mean we'll, I mean, I'll not be seein' so much a ya?' Then another thought seemed to strike him and his eyes narrowed. 'Say ya don' have a 'fishin' buddy down Florida way do ya?' He growled, 'Know they do real big game fishin' in Florida'.

Jesus, Jack thought, all these years an' all that water under the bridge an Ennis Del Mar is still jealous! Jack's mouth curved. 'Naw Ennis, ain't had no fishin' buddy but you since that argument in, when wus it now? '83?'


Now is the time, he breathed deeply closed his eyes for a moment then, for the god knows how many'th time he proposed to his man. Keeping his voice casual he said, 'Ya know I can get a double apartment for not much more than a single- yer rheumatics are worse than mine. Some Florida sunshine would do 'em good. Why doncha come with me.'

Jack waited for all the reasons. His girls- well that wouldn't work. Airplanes cheap as anything these days. Girls could come visit for a holiday. He could go 'an stay with them for a bit if'n the wear and tear of livin' together full time got too much. '

'Two guys livin' together- no way!' But they wouldn't be 'two guys living together' they would be two old buddies sharing costs in an old folks home- sorry Bobby 'Senior citizens retirement complex'.

Still he was braced for the idea to be dismissed out of hand. Jack thought his hearin' had finally gone funny when he heard Ennis say. 'Ya sure it wouldn't be too expensive like? Ya know I'm not flush Jack. Got a little cash put away from that spell a horse breedin' I did a few years back, an ya know ya helped me with pointin' me in the right direction with some investments. Couldn't afford anything fancy like'.  

Jack's hearing did go funny. He heard buzzing as he became lightheaded and thought he would pass out. Ennis had looked at him concerned.

 'Hey Bud, ya OK, ya gone a funny colour.'

And so it came to pass that, late and unexpected Jack and Ennis finally got the good life. 

'Hey Bud fancy one a them cocktails with the umbrellas?'

Jack smiled, 'sure do Bud, sure do.'"

"event","My entry to the August 'Dreams' challenge. 

Jack dreams of freedom.

Jack gathered up the supper dishes and went to the river to wash up. The evening was unusually warm for this early in the season and he rolled his jeans and waded into the water.<lj-cut text=""Read more""> He felt the coolness of the water and the tiny currents massaging his legs. The comfort of the food and whiskey in his belly felt good- yeah everything felt good. The sun sat orange in the sky making everything glow soft and golden. He closed his eyes,breathed deeply and felt himself relax. A smile crept onto his face as the happiness bubbled from deep inside. 

He turned back to the bank and looked to where Ennis rested against a log. Their eyes locked and he felt himself become light. Oh -it was going to happen now - in front of Ennis. It usually only happened when he was alone or in a crowd of strangers. As he moved back towards Ennis and the campfire he felt - he didn't need to look to know- his feet no longer touched the ground. He was flying. 

In the movies superheroes flew horizontal, with their arms out. But when he flew it was upright. Just skimming along. For now it was just a few inches above the ground, and slow and gentle. Nonetheless, it was the most wonderful feeling- defying gravity, free to move with no friction, no penalty of energy loss, smooth, silent and intoxicating. 

He willed himself towards Ennis and gradually drifted closer. Ennis watched,unsurprised by his friends means of travel, as Ennis smiled Jack felt a surge of energy and found himself moving faster. 

He whirled around Ennis and laughed ' Hey Ennis, look, I can fly!'. As he moved around in front of his friend he reached out a hand. 'C'mon Ennis, it's fun, let's fly'. Ennis continued to smile but didn't move. 

'C'mon Ennis', Jack repeated, holding out his hand. But Ennis just shook his head slightly and Jack heard words form in his mind 'Ain't a flyer Jack, not like you'.

Ennis rose and walked towards the tent, Jack drifted after him. 'Aw, c'mon Ennis, wontcha even try?' Ennis turned and smiled a sad, knowing smile and vanished inside the tent. 

Jack awoke from a half remembered dream. His body felt warm and tingly, but his heart felt empty and sad. He slipped from the bed, made his way to the den, and poured himself another whiskey. He knew he would get no more sleep this night."

'The Brokeback Blues'
<lj-cut text=""Read more""> 
Jack's song.

I close my eyes and drift away 
to a different time, to a different day,
When love was fresh and fierce and free
When no hurt or hate hobbled you or me.

The sun bleached away all stain of sin
The wind blew away all stench of shame
Clean and new and eager to begin
Spirits unbroken, we knew how to win.

Got the Brokeback Blues calling 
through a life of tears
Got the Brokeback Blues calling
through all the years.

When love calls your name she demands a reply,
When love stands before you she demands your eye.
So don't look away, you can't meet love with fear
If you are not brave then she cannot hear
If you are not bold, she can't see 
And she'll walk on by you and me.

Got the Brokeback Blues calling 
through a life of tears
Got the Brokeback Blues calling
through all the years.

Look at me now, don't avert your gaze
Don't mumble a reply through a numbed haze
of maybe's, if's could-have-beens
A threadbare script like worn out jeans.

Love is eternal, it never dies
If you blow your lines through countless tries
The same scene repeats to erase the lies.
The body decays and ends in the grave
But the soul lives on and love is saved.

The windows are different
but the spark is the same
Will you catch its glow
Will you know my name?

Next time we meet will you recognize?
will you know who I am?
will you see through my eyes?

Got the Brokeback Blues calling 
through a life of tears
Got the Brokeback Blues calling
through all the years.

From the mountain top to the depth of the sea
Next time I look in your eyes will you see me?

Brokeback Blues
Ennis' song

Wasn't lookin' for love, just tryin' to survive,
Love's a luxury when you're just stayin' alive
But somewhere on a mountain filled with blue sky's
I fell into the ocean of your deep blue eyes.

I tried to resist but the fall was too high
By the time I landed I couldn't even try
To walk away, though I wanted to
Was bound too strong by those eyes so blue.

Got the Brokeback Blues calling 
through a life of tears
Got the Brokeback Blues calling
through all the years.

I kept on feelin' what I didn't want to name
Love's a prison cell when it's filled with shame
Tried so hard to break the lock on the door
Tried so hard 'till I couldn't take no more


The stolen time beyond a life so tough
Just made us need more- never enough
Didn't realize what I had 'till it was gone
Didn't understand how deep I would mourn.

Got the Brokeback Blues calling 
through a life of tears
Got the Brokeback Blues calling
through all the years.


Now I know you can't mess with love
Now I know it's no peaceful dove
No soft and sentimental cry
Love is the reason we live and die.

Next time we meet I won't turn away
Next time I will have something to say
From that mountain top 
To the depth of the sea
When I look in your eyes I'll say 
Please love me.

Got the Brokeback Blues calling 
through a life of tears
Got the Brokeback Blues calling
through all the years."

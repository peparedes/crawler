      I also have a myspace now because Megane wouldn't stop pestering me about having one. 

         I watched The Notebook... Finally! and I gotta tell you that was such a GOOD movie! thats the best movie i've ever seen. I have never cried so much... mann sooooooo good!

            I also went to the soccer game last night that was super fun.. Julie and I brought like 50 blankets and we won! 1-0! haha

Well on Friday I went with Brooke to the Hockey game because, Brooke and I love going (yelling at Clintron haha just kidding). That was fun but of course <EM><STRONG>FREEZING</STRONG></EM>. There was a lot of people there at the hockey game this time, but we lost bad 7-1 because, Dustin one of the best players on the team his ice skates were broken or something I don't remember. Then after wards we went to Sonic (of course fatties represent ha ha). Then we went home for a bit and then went to Travis's house and met Will. He was pretty cool. On Saturday it was <STRONG>K's Birthday</STRONG> (HE'S A MAN MUAHAHA)&nbsp;and it was&nbsp;just crazy I hated it! I got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of <U><STRONG>EVERYONE</STRONG></U>. But I don't feel like putting the details. On Sunday was K's birthday party but I didn't go cause I didn't feel to good (if ya know what I mean). So I felt really bad but I would've just made a fool out of myself anyways ha ha. And today I'm going to go to the Texas Baptist Church and give gifts to the children.

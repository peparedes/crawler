"event","Oh you guys. It's gotten to the point where I have to consult my calendar to figure out what to write in here, both because I'm so much busier than I used to be and also because I only update once a month now apparently.

<b>o1.)</b> I am balls-deep in wedding season, I have one every single weekend (I had a fucking RARE Saturday off last weekend and it was GLORIOUS) and sometimes even two. That is the worst; I had a 7 hour on Friday and then a 9.5 hour yesterday. My first set of back-to-back weddings this summer fucked up my feet to an unheard of degree, I need to see a podiatrist because this is not normal. Anyway, so those tie up my weekends and then post-processing ties up my weekdays. We had the Minnesota Bride awards the other week, it was pretty much the biggest perk of my job to date (half the time, I get the same food guests do at weddings and that's the only other perk. You know, besides witnessing the occasional supreme love and beauty that actually makes me cry on the job). We met at a bridal shop for a pre-party because our company is like BFF with them, and all their employees were my age and adorable and fun and I wish I worked there instead but understand I wouldn't get to be creative so I'd probably die IDK. But it was fun, look:

<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/lissiexanga/MNBride_zpsc380f995.jpg"">
1: Those Marilyns on the wall, I DIED OKAY. 2: See look at all the adorable girls from the bridal shop. 3: Look at all the people in that cool-ass venue. The words on the back wall say ""The world is yours""! 4: Champagne and red velvet cupcakes!

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/lissiexanga/MNBride2_zps43e5c41e.jpg"">
1: Me and Sue, I love shooting with her, we have so much fun. Also, my shoes. 2: FUCKING LIKE, TURTLE CHEESECAKE.
</center>

<b>o2.)</b> I locked in that second dance team documentary for next year, I met with their coach and she is lovely. I also got booked for head shots for my other team, and I may possibly be designing their media guide as well but that's a ways out. I also got a RANDOM inquiry for shooting two dance performances in San Diego next year? I have no idea where it came from and it wasn't a super personal email so I'm not sure about it but if it's legit that would be fun.

<b>o3.)</b> I teamed up with that photographer I bought a lens from, Barry, for a boudoir shoot. It was really fun but I need to talk to him about being more sensitive. Like the images are great and he is really great with light but I'm not sure I want to work with him for boudoir. It's like he doesn't get that there are topless women in the room who might not want you in their face as much. Anyway. I would love to show you some images but we promised we wouldn't until the model signed off on them. Then I will! After the shoot, he also <i>gave</i> me a lens, an 85mm 1.8 because ""after seeing the wedding trailer you did for my daughter, I realized you were grossly underpaid."" I thought that was super fucking classy. Here is the aforementioned trailer, I am behind on their full edit so I'm kind of freaking out, but:

<center><lj-embed id=""350""/></center>

<b>o4.)</b> Jason and I started ballroom dance lessons! We've had three lessons, they're not like weekly or whatever, it's kind of inconsistent because I'm trading head shots for lessons and both the instructor and I have random schedules and have to prioritize work that actually pays us teh monies. But it's fun! We've started Salsa, Cha-Cha, and Swing. I get frustrated because Jason holds us up a lot of the time. I don't get mad because I know dancing comes easy to me but it just really frustrates me because it's to the point where I haven't really learned anything new, and when I have, it's taken me less than 5 minutes to get it down - we are still that basic. But it's a good activity for us. I'm upset that our instructor, my friend Rhett, is moving to Nashville in October and it's just a bummer because he's really cool. All my friends leave. Where's my violin.

<b>o5.</b> I did the Color Run last weekend! Our cousins were supposed to come with me and my sister, but they suddenly had a wedding out of state? It was total bullshit. So we each got a friend to go in their place. We did not run, LOL, but I brought the Go Pro and I fucking love the Color Run, okay, I recommend it to EVERYONE.

I signed up for a yoga triathlon next weekend, it's like an hour of sculpt yoga, some walking/running, and then hot yoga. I miss being in shape, I know I'm not overweight but some of my most adorable clothes don't fit anymore and I just feel gross. I used to be so toned from dance and I am just lacking the motivation at the moment, I just feel so busy and I know it's not an excuse but damn.

I have like three other updates to make, hold tight. I feel like I end every entry by saying that nobody is here anymore. I am probably contributing to the problem but it's not as fun to update when I feel like I'm blogging to an empty room."

"event","<b>o1.)</b> I have been working a lot with that <b>dance studio</b> - I love it so much.

<lj-cut text=""+++ Web design, print design, gushing about how good it feels to have my first ideal client +++"">&rarr; I don't consider this news anymore, but I <b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=475336282546075&amp;set=a.121911644555209.30097.120990731313967&amp;type=1&amp;theater"">redesigned and launched their website</a></b> to great reviews. The old site was a total shit show, and I wanted to redo it long before she ever even asked me to. Like I was so excited when she asked me because I'd been wanting to fix it for over a year just because it bugged me so much even though it literally didn't even affect me at all. So I did that, and she wrote me a check on the spot without even BLINKING ABOUT IT. I am still getting used to clients who don't fight me on being ""too expensive"". Like I still preface jobs by saying ""If you have questions about this (the price) then we can talk about it"" and I need to not. She has told me she has no issue with it because ""she understands that you get what you pay for"". &hearts; I feel like I've probably mentioned it before but in her, <b>I have landed my first <i>ideal client</i></b>. I have little clients here and there that are great, or big consistent ones that are a pain in the ass, but she's the first mix of the two, all the best parts. She always has something for me to do, she doesn't email me 50x a day, she doesn't try to ""get deals"" or pay with ""experience"". I love working with her.

&rarr; I also <b>designed and delivered a recital book</b> two weeks ago, and when I got to her dress rehearsal she asked if I'd like to come back and see it in the reals. She let me take it ""because I know you like to have copies of your things"". So we're looking at it and she's just like, ""You are so good at what you do. And I just love working with you"" and sending me texts with hearts-in-eyes emoticons about how much she loves the books and everything, writing ""Thank you! &hearts;!"" in the memos of my checks, like IT IS SO NICE YOU GUYS TO ACTUALLY WANT TO TALK TO A CLIENT AND DO STUFF FOR THEM. Like this wedding photographer, she drives me nuts and constantly calls and leaves 5 minute voicemails and demands that I ~confirm~ every single email she sends no matter how mundane, she constantly contradicts herself, etc, like I want to die 80% of the time. But this dance work is so great and I am so in my element. Also she's open to new things, like I got her tweeting, you guys.

&rarr; I shot their <b>recitals</b> too, she's letting me sell prints on the website. Like how much do I love this. Some previews that I posted on my <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Alyssa-Kristine-Photography/120990731313967"">Facebook page</a>:</lj-cut>

<center><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=485737088172661&amp;set=a.121911644555209.30097.120990731313967&amp;type=1&amp;theater""><img src=""https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/981630_485737088172661_1331961520_o.jpg"" width=""600"" border=""0""></a></center>
Also I love getting to work in multiple areas of her brand, because I get to know it and I get to control how all my work functions as a whole, if that makes sense, and how everything matches and links together. Like I put an ad for the photos in the recital book, and then I get to put them up on the website and control how it looks and functions. I like doing this ""whole package"" thing, and I'm thinking more and more lately that I need to rename my company from ""photography"" to ""media and design"", and also start a separate company for my fanvideos of life once I start getting more of those.

<b>o2.)</b> SPEAKING OF THOSE, another high school saw the <b>dance team video</b> I did and has called me about following them next season as well. Nothing is confirmed yet but if everything is well I'll get to work with TWO TEAMS next year. It's starting, you guys. I would be so happy if I got so many of those that I actually had to hire and train other videographers and assistant editors. Like what if I did 5-10+ of those over the winter, recitals and theatre in the spring, and weddings in the summer, and then other random projects throughout - like what an awesome calendar year making enough money to sustain and actually buy nice things and new equipment without having to think about it.

<b>o3.)</b> OH I shot a <b>high school theatre production</B> and that prompted me to <b>start selling prints</b> for the first time ever, <lj-cut text=""oh and how easy it is!"">I hadn't sold prints before! I was under the illusion that it was a tremendous amount of work, but I bought a Zenfolio account AND THEY DO IT ALL FOR ME. I post-process the images as I normally would, but instead of burning them to a CD for the client, I just upload them into an album. Then people ""shop"", add images and sizes to their cart, I approve the order and it's printed at a lab and shipped directly to their home. It's actually like less work than getting them a CD, IDK why I didn't start doing this sooner. It is also much more lucrative. The show director is leaving after this year, but asked if I'd be interested in shooting them every year for a flat rate. I said I'm interested and would absolutely talk about it, and she passed my info on to her replacement. So we'll see where that goes; if I can make more money with prints I'll obviously stick with that but if I break even or make more, I'll just do it for a flat rate, whatevs. I hope they follow up because I love shooting theatre and everyone is happy.</lj-cut>

<b>o4.)</b> I <b>bought a new lens</b>! A 70-200mm f/2.8, it is heavy as shit and my arms hurt but it's perfection for the type of shooting I do: weddings, theatre, dance, anything dark. It better be perfect because I spent over $2000 on it lol. I had the Tamron brand for half the price but it was designed SO STUPIDLY, the zoom and focus rings were backwards from what I was used to so I exchanged it for the Nikon even at the price difference just because I was that annoyed by it.

&rarr; I also <b>bought a 28-75mm f/2.8</b> from a photographer who was selling it for a decent price. <lj-cut text=""And he turned out to be so awesome and now I&#39;m doing work for him? Including video for his daughter&#39;s wedding!!"">There's a local film/gear swap group on Facebook which is where I saw his posting. So I messaged him and then we spoke on the phone, he was super nice, etc. So I drove to his studio which feels farther away than it actually is, it's about 30 minutes. Anyway, he was VERY NICE - he was an older guy I got zero creep factor from, and we just talked shop for an hour! It was so fucking REFRESHING to be around someone who actually knows their shit and is just bursting at the seams to share it. When I was testing out the lens, he asked if I always shoot with my right eye, like he just noticed that and then told me I should re-train to my left eye because cameras are designed that way and all the reasons why. He's been doing photography for like 40 years so he told me all this history stuff too, showed me all his old lenses, and other random tricks like how if I ever want a model to look sweaty to spray them with cooking spray. He pulled out this bag and asked me if I had ""one of these"". I said no obviously because I didn't know what it was and he took my camera, locked up the mirror and cleaned it for me! Like he is so NICE and you can just tell he LOVES photography so much.

<b>o5.)</b> Relatedly, we've exchanged emails after the fact and have talked about shooting fitness models and ""glamour"", meaning classy boudoir-type, which I've always wanted to do. He says it's important that he has a female to work with so his clients feel more comfortable. It's new to him so he wants to do a couple shoots to see if he can make a proper marketing kit, and he talked about me assisting and said he'd pay me to post-process and also pay me for referrals. He also asked if I do video work, and then after I showed him that dance doc he asked if I could do <b>his daughter's wedding</b>!! And he offered to pay me to do it even though it's my first wedding video. Do you know how huge that is to me? For the past 2-3 years, all I can REMEMBER is new creative people trying to pay me with experience points. I have to give up a really fun scavenger hunt date with Jas to do the wedding, but such is life. He also mentioned there'd be no better wedding to make a sample with than one that is geared toward photography - meaning he helped his daughter plan around what would make good photographs, I can't deal.</lj-cut>

<b>o6.)</b> Just talking to him for like three days has given me less of a tolerance for my other wedding ""client"", which she has made clear by legally defining that we are independent contractors and not employees. Not like I ever felt like I WAS an employee, but I just referred to her as my ""boss"" because she books everything and tells me what to do. ANYWAY, she mailed us all this ~contract~, which pisses me off in GENERAL because when we she and I were arguing over pay and how she contradicts herself at the end of last year, *I* asked for a contract. And she said she wasn't a big contract person or some dumb shit. OH but now I get a contract. The other two shooters just signed it immediately without thinking about it, which pisses me off because even though they have issues with it too, it just makes me look like a pain in the ass when I actually stand up to her. So when I took more than two days to sign it, SHE MAILED ME ANOTHER ONE. AS IF I DIDN'T GET THE FIRST. No I'm thinking about it, and it's been two fucking days, chill. 

The thing is, I'm okay with 90% of it. <lj-cut text=""I&#39;m mainly concerned with her non-compete section - tell me if you think this is b.s."">I'm mainly concerned with her non-compete section. ""It's unacceptable to promote any other photography business, even outside of weddings."" Um. What? What does that mean. Obviously I'm not going to promote myself or anyone else on the premises of her weddings, but the way this is written I can't promote anything else anywhere. And even if she means ""outside of weddings"" as ""other photography besides weddings"", that's still bullshit because all she DOES is weddings. Why would she CARE if I promote dance photography? She doesn't do it! And not only does she not advertise anything else, I've heard her tell people she doesn't do anything else. So that's issue #1 I have. Issue #2: She says we can't ""render professional services"" to anyone who has been her client. Okay I would have already broken that when my friend Katie asked me to shoot her business seminar. Like it's just stupid, AND I do a fuck ton more than she does - what if someone wants a website done? What if someone wants design work? What if someone wants a video? I'm not going to vet all my future clients to make sure they've never worked with her, and it's not breaking a non-compete if it's competition over stuff SHE DOESN'T FUCKING KNOW HOW TO DO EVEN IF SHE WANTED TO.  

There's other little things too - like it only terminates upon 45 days written notice, and ""despite any termination of this Agreement, I agree to fulfill all assigned weddings"". No. It terminates when it terminates, and if you're going to continue to make me work for the rest of the year anyway, why terminate at all. Like there is nothing in here that protects or supports me so there is literally no incentive to sign it. So I'm not going to? And if that means I can't work with her then good luck finding a replacement for the 15 weddings I have on the calendar this year. Because it's not like you'll have a signed contract to hold me to. She just stresses me out, it might be time to gtfo. </lj-cut>

So yeah! That's where I've been and what I've been doing most of the time. I've reached a point where I am legitimately working at least four hours a day, which doesn't sound like a lot but it's huge for me. Jason's doing well too, he got a job offer at a new company but didn't take it because his current company gave him a nice raise to stay. He's also booked an independent consulting job for some guy's new iPhone app. So we've been so busy with work stuff lately but it seems to be really pulling together for both of us."

"event","I've been absent, obviously. I think I mainly feel like no one is here like they used to be so it's less fun to update. It's been starting to bother me, though - I've been used to being able to come on here and look up pretty much any detail and lately I haven't had that. Then, the less I update, the more I feel like I need to get caught up on and it's so intimidating that I just don't.

<b>Work;</b>
I finished the dance team video. I dropped it off to one of the coaches, she loved it so much and then later I got a text from the other coach - ""I just watched it and um, you're a fucking genius."" It was my favorite because she tends to be pretty p.c., so that was srs. I am really proud of it and it was so strange/wonderful to edit using all of my own footage. I have obviously pretty much stopped fandom!editing, mostly because I'm not consumed by and passionate enough about pretty much anything ever since House ruined me, but this was amazing to do and it felt like home. It was stressful because I actually had a deadline for once, but it all pulled together. This is my favorite section:

You can watch the whole thing <b><a href=""https://vimeo.com/61401442"">[[ HERE ]]</a></b>. There's a media company literally two blocks from our apartment, so Jas and I walked over there to meet with them last week. They're currently printing copies for all of the girls, with cover art and DVD labels and shrink wrap. I am so excited to actually hold one in my hands, this is like the <i>first</i> thing I've done entirely by myself. This is the packaging I designed:

So I'm still pretty excited about all of that. I also <b><a href=""http://alyssakristine.com/client/2013_SummerWEB.pdf"" target=""_blank"">designed a summer brochure for a dance studio</a></b>, she liked it so much she asked me to redo and maintain her website. It needs A LOT of help, tbh, so I'm really excited to just go in and start from scratch. When I went to meet with her about it, she was like, ""Aren't you just so excited that I'm going to keep you busy for the rest of your life?!"" And that made me <i>so</i> happy because I have wanted to redo this website and be her go-to media person for years. SO I am happy to report that I've landed my first Ideal Client. We talked about more future design work, photographing her recitals, maybe making choreography videos for her girls, etc. And she is super easy to work with - she trusts me totally and doesn't ever fight me on money or how much things cost. I love her.

The first wedding I have on the schedule for this year is the first week of May, and then I have one almost every weekend. I also booked one of my own in July. I'm not really looking forward to working for someone else, she stresses me out greatly and I'm thinking this is going to be my last season with her. She has me booked for a wedding in October, and they just announced the date for our local SlutWalk (that I'd already volunteered to shoot) and it falls on that date. I need to tell her that I can't shoot anymore that day but I'm dreading the lecture. I know I made a commitment to her but I hate how she books me for the entire fucking year - shit comes up. She constantly compares me to ""the other girls"" (""the other girls let me know right away if they're available"" the time that I literally took 18 hours to respond to an email - 18 HOURS) and I'm sorry but they're in their late 40's, they're settled and they have their lives figured out. I am 24 fucking years old. I don't even know where I want to live next year. And the SlutWalk is much closer to what I'd like to do with my life. I'm just dreading her drama and guilt trip even though she has six months to figure it out. She is so controlling and she loves to make stress for herself.

I haven't done much photography lately and I'm actually okay with that, even though design work gives me TMJ. 

Will update about personal stuff shortly because otherwise it'd be tl;dr.
I still hate this new update page layout."

Right now I'm super deep into dance team work, as last weekend was Sectionals and they go to State on Friday. Then I'll be editing, editing, editing. I have already started but it's hard when I know there's more A+ footage coming, and if they win State it will totally change the narrative. But I am so happy and so excited, I traveled with them this past weekend - I was SO IN MY ELEMENT, I miss it all so much. The girls are great and have really warmed up to me. They are also getting used to a camera being there, which is always helpful. I also met one of the dads who helped raise money so that they could hire me and things, he was very nice and said he hoped this can be continued because having a video will be priceless for the girls, and that a core chunk of the team are sophomores so I'll be able to follow them up. I really hope they ask me back next year but I am not especially worried. The videos that made the coaches decide to hire me are some of the worst I've done from a technical standpoint so I know their minds will be blown. Plus I have a whole decade of editing experience since then!

<b>o1.</b> First off, <lj user=""flourhurricane"">, <lj user=""london_fan"">, <lj user=""red_scully"">, <lj user=""wanderlonely""> I got your cards!! I treasure the all of you beyond measure. &hearts; &hearts; They are proudly displayed on my fridge, and Marie the glitter is proudly displayed on my counter. ;) REALLY, I AM SERIOUS WHEN I SAY I LOVE IT THOUGH.

<b>o2.</b> I didn't mention it on here, but my sister got a new puppy! He is presh! If you follow me on Instagram you've already seen it but <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/lissiexanga/ScreenShot2012-12-24at123429PM_zps21bff135.png"">HOW CUTE</a>. He is still very tiny, he's barely growing at all, and he is still teething. After she got him, she invited me to her apartment for an overnight. It was adorable - we had tossed the idea around but I wasn't going to go because she lives like an hour and a half away (at school), then she went shopping and texted me a photo of all the candy and shit she bought with ""there's more where this came from... if you come for a sleepover."" LOL ADORBS. So I went and I while she was at class I shot a bunch of footage for a short about the puppeh but I haven't edited it yet. I WILL SHOW YOU WHEN I DO.

<b>o3.</b> I STARTED DANCE VIDEOGRAPHY I LOVE IT SO MUCH OH MY GOD BRB EXPLODING. I only went to their first competition so far but they are so fun and talented and the coaches are so great, they like, ask my opinion on stuff! Like how the dance looked and all, it's impossible for me to tell through a lens but the fact that they ask and would want to know what I think means a lot to me. <a href=""http://alyssakristine.com/blog/2012/12/18/dance-videography-benilde-the-beginning/"">I made a post on my other blog</a> about it if you would like to know more - I even included gifs of my shots if you are interested!

<center><img src=""http://alyssakristine.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2.gif""></center>
I've also had a couple of v cute shoots this week, I've posted teasers on my <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Alyssa-Kristine-Photography/120990731313967"">photography page</a>, the first is a referral from a friend (pink frilly dress, pearls, and bows in her scraggly little hair, slays me), and the second is my old dance coach's adorable family (the little girl kept calling me ""Isha"", yelling ""Cheese me!"", running over for hugs and thinking I was coming home with them lol). She also brought me like 30 old VHS tapes for me to convert to DVD and they are all like dance tapes, so win! I'm finding myself super involved with technical work revolving around dance and that is a GREAT place for me to be. Love it. Shooting a concert tonight!

<b>o4.</b> My grandma had us over for dinner last week, my mom popped out and yelled ""SURPRISE!"", it was so cute and I bring it up because at one point I had to go in the kitchen and instead of just walking, I had intended on running and sliding in my socks, so I started half-jogging and my mom ran behind me and grabbed my arm and we both started sliding at the exact same time. Like yeah I look just like her and everything but the little things like that, we are so alike in even little ways and I want to remember these things. My grandma is also SWEET AND KIND AS FUCK, she gave us her Christmas tree! She got a new one and gave us our old one, we have a tree you guys! 

<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/lissiexanga/003-3_zpsb5a04804.jpg""></center>
Speaking of my grandma, she has this new boyfriend and she keeps asking me for advice and it's absolutely slaying me, okay. ""He just wants to sit and make out now and I am not, nor have I ever been, the kind of girl who just... goes to bed with someone, so."" DYING. Like what an unexpected life treasure, giving your grandmother dating advice.

<b>o5.</b> Last night, my sister, mom, and I all came home and had a good old-fashioned sleepover. We made dinner, did our nails, had drinks and totally intended to watch I Love You, Man but ended up watching fail compilations and Whose Line bloopers on YouTube for like four hours and laughing to the point of tears. My sister went to bed early and then my mom and I stayed up for two more hours, playing volleyball with my Om Nom doll up in the bedroom and talking about boys. Then she made us french toast for breakfast while I wrote this! &hearts;

And I think everything else needs to be f-locked, work and friend drama, you know, the usual~. 
Christmas getting its own entry too, tl;dr. Love love all of you! I'M SORRY I'VE BEEN LAX ABOUT LIVEJOURNAL, I've been busy and when I haven't been busy, I've been playing Batman: Arkham City. Truth.

<b>EDIT:</b> OH MY GOD HOW COULD I FORGET THIS - I woke up on Christmas morning having dreamt that I was at some company Christmas party. There were three rooms with karaoke going on, guys were getting drunk and taking their suit jackets off and sweating at the mics. I was sitting at a table with my friend Ali, when Cuddy came over and said that we'd be having a girls party tomorrow and to stop by her office at 6 to help her plan or let her know what we wanted for dinner. Except then I realized it wasn't a Christmas party, it was an end-of-(something: season, career, it was going to be like the end of the year banquets we always had for dance) party, so when she walked away, I got up and walked the other direction because I was going to start crying and I didn't want her to see. So I roamed down some hall crying and ended up running into her anyway. She hugged me and was swaying me back and forth, both in our high heels, and then she UNDID HER BLOUSE and she was so toned you guys, damn, and wearing a deep blue bra. So this was literally my subconscious' Christmas present to myself, letting me feel her up. Then she said something about how I was ""too much like her"", obviously meaning being too timid in this situation because then she flipped us around and slammed me into this gold railing. I cannot."

He's being a crazy fitness instructor at work today (also he was on the Halloween party planning committee, shut up how cute). I wish I could say that I was being something awesome but the curse of Liss & Halloween is that I never get too amped for it until like, the day of, at which point I always wish I had put some effort in. Every year. Without fail. I think the fact that I went to Zombie Pub Crawl with my sister two weeks ago helped me get my Halloween bug out. I was balloon zombie, of Plants vs Zombies fame -

We went with my sister's ex-boyfriend (not her serious one, someone she dated in high school who came out so now they are like BFF and I love it) and his cousin, we had a lot of fun. All of them were like, ""People are going to be dicks and pop your balloons"" and I was like, ""Are you serious?!"" I had never even thought that, but when they said it I realized they were probably right and I was so sad. LOL though, we had to cram five of us into a car plus my five balloons, it was uncomfortable. ANYWAY POINT BEING, I POPPED ALL OF MY OWN DAMN BALLOONS, LMAO. We were walking to the first bar and I heard my sister yell ""LISS LISS!!!!!!1"" and then I heard *POW POW* - two of them popped on a fence. Then I popped one my cigarette, and then I popped one on a light post. I popped the last one on purpose because I was sick of dealing with it lol. Stupid costume. Clever and creative in theory, pain-in-the-ass in execution. There were a lot of fun people there, SO many people oh my god, food trucks, tents with performers and DJs, it was fun, I want to go next year but with more people; nothing against them or my sister but we didn't stay as long as I wanted to because they just wanted to go to a regular, non-zombified gay bar. Which again, nothing against gay bars - I love gay bars because no one ever skeazes on me and I can totally relax - but if I'm a zombie I want to be at the zombie event lol.

&rarr; I shot a wedding with Tracy, we had a GREAT DAY and I can't wait to work with her more. She's so talented but it doesn't go to her head, she doesn't look down on me and she constantly asks for my opinion and takes it seriously. It is so refreshing.

Need to explain because I don't think I ever officially have - prolific local wedding photographer has had Tracy as a 2nd shooter for several years, and when she was looking for more shooters, Tracy suggested me - it was a process but now we work together along with a few of her other shooters (only one of which I've worked with yet). I'm working with her a lot more next year because I got a ~promotion~, I've been bumped from 3rd shooter or 2nd with a training rate, to official 2nd for next year. Pay almost doubled, which is awesome because I was getting frustrated. She's very happy with my coverage, and told me that next year I'm going to be a 2nd ""right under Tracy"" and I'm not clear if that means that I'm literally going to be 2nd to Tracy's lead, or if it means that she's got like a totem pole of talent and I'm right under Tracy now, either of which I AM FINE WITH. 

I'm also getting more responsibilities with her, which I am also happy about because I have been capable the entire time; I'm glad she's seeing it and trusting me with it. Aside from shooting and color correcting, she's started trusting me to edit down images, and when we finish all the post work for this season, she has design and marketing work for me. We had an awful day last week - I went into it knowing that I may not walk out with a job but I was very much at my breaking point. I sent a super eloquent email explaining everything I was thinking, and she just insisted I call her which I hate because I am so much better with email - I forget important points on the phone, and I feel like I don't know how to communicate them on the spot without sounding like a dick. So I was dreading that phone call hard core. We argued a LITTLE but it was fine for the most part and everything turned out okay. And Jason was right - every time I stand up to her, I get more work... I'm not sure why but I'm not complaining.</lj-cut></center>
&rarr; I didn't intend for this entry to be all ~work work work~ but <b>I GOT THE BEST JOB EVER</b> - I get to follow a dance team around for a season, take footage and edit them a music video. It's not even the team I normally work with! The old coach I had when I was a freshman got in touch with me because she still has the video I made that year and wanted to hire me to make one this season for her current team. They are a FANTASTIC team, I'm super familiar just from being involved in dance but I am so excited to work with those talented girls and my old coaches again. Also, brb, getting *paid* to edit a fanvideo. I AM SO EXCITED TO SHOOT VIDEO, ALSO. I know the shots I want and will be able to get them since I won't be doing my make-up or stretching or dancing myself. I also know the moments they're going to want to remember, because I've lived it. Honestly I would be happy just shooting and editing dance teams full time, I am so excited to impress them because I would love to keep them as a client. Their first competition is in December, slkfjas. ALSO, I got Jason a GoPro for his birthday so I'm going to bring him some days to take footage with that, like all the seniors doing their favorite jumps at 120 fps, Christ CHRIST. And I'm going to do tiny interviews and all, I really cannot wait. People are starting to pay me for doing what I love the most, it is an amazing feeling.

&rarr; I love the new Taylor Swift album, I hate the new Livejounal ""Friends"" page. No, really, it's fucking abhorrent and to be honest, not much is still keeping me here. I want to mention <b><a href=""http://blog.alyssakristine.com"">my other blog</a></b> so you can follow me there; when LJ finally actually dies I'll probably just use that full time lol.

<lj-cut text=""+++"">&rarr; Last week (October 11, to be exact), I had a very traumatic experience - I got up early to run a bunch of errands, basically I drove around for hours with no problems, but after I ran into Bruegger's for a sandwich, my car started doing strange things. It was fine on the tiny frontage road, but when I went to merge onto the highway, it didn't accelerate as quickly as usual. I thought nothing of this, it still accelerated and I figured it was just being a little bitch. My steering wheel started to vibrate a bit, much like the time I was in 2nd gear and didn't know it. I thought that was the issue but I was in Drive, so what the fuck. I was literally like a mile from my house so I was just going to suck it up and call my dad when I got home, but coming up to a stoplight, my car LOCKED THE FUCK UP. I could not press down on the brake, I couldn't twist my wheel. I turned the car off, and then it wouldn't restart. I was stuck in the left lane of traffic, on the fucking highway. People started honking at me and shit even though my hazard lights were on, I started crying because what the fuck am I supposed to do.

A very nice guy stopped behind me and walked up to my window, told me he'd push my into the turn lane at least. He got in my car and did something to unlock my wheels and managed to get me out of the way. He was so kind and I was so grateful for him. I called the cops because my dad told me to, IDK, and the woman cop who came up to my car was SO nice also, she told me to stay in the car and put my seatbelt on in case I got hit, and she'd call me a tow. She came up later and was like, ""I don't personally care, and I'm not going to do anything about it, but I wanted to remind you that your tabs are expired."" SO fucking nice, seriously. Waiting for the tow truck, I just sat in my car eating my sandwich as traffic sped by, the sun was hot on my skin even though the day was chilly when I left that morning. It got towed alright but for awhile we thought the car was totally shot. When I started writing this entry, that was the view point. It's since been fixed for just $165 in parts + labor, which my dad actually stepped up and took care of for once. So it's all good now, just a pain in the ass.

&rarr; Our dog died on October 7th. He lived with my sister, the last time I saw him was my mom's birthday party, she brought him up from Uni. His ears were bugging him that day and that's how it all started. They started leaking pus a few days later so we thought it was some sort of allergy, or that he'd gotten into fertilizer or something. His hair started falling out, he started bleeding in random places on his skin, he was just in awful shape and so much pain and nobody could figure out what was wrong with him. They thought it was allergies, or a staph infection, they were trying a bunch of steroids and medications. The day he died, my sister left to go to the laundromat. When she came back, he tried to get up but fell right over. She called the vet and he suspected it was just his new pain medication and to stop giving it to him. He died 20 minutes later right in front of her, it was so abrupt; it wasn't like his breathing slowed over a period of 10 minutes and he just died - no, he literally took two sharp breaths and just died on her couch, he didn't even shut his eyes. She saw it happen and then she had to carry his body to her car and drive him to the vet on her lap, she was all by herself and I can't imagine what that must have been like for her. I would not have been able to do that.

We were all so sad about it, he was only 7 years old and they still don't know exactly what caused it. I hate that he was in so much pain leading up to it, it was such an awful way to die and he never deserved anything like that. I hate how helpless we all felt and it makes me the most sad when I think about it from his point of view. I know I shouldn't do that shit to myself but I can't help it. He was such a great dog, he had the best personality, he loved to wear clothes and play with his Aunt Lissa, he was the most spirited little thing and I can't believe he's gone. I wanted to post a photo of him here but I don't have the energy and I'm still very sad.

There was some other piece of crap news I wanted to put in here but I don't remember anymore.  It was probably the fact that Jason's mom is a huge bitch and we got in a big fight over it and I hate her, but I don't have enough emotion today to hash that all out right now. God.</lj-cut>"

"event","If you're friends with me on Facebook, you saw already and I apologize for the spam because I feel like I didn't shut the fuck up about it ever, but I have to mention it here in my effort to get caught up. I went along with Jordan Matter on a Dancers Among Us shoot and it was <i>the best day ever.</i> I wanted to tell you about it the second I was invited but I didn't want to jinx it. I have been a huge fan of that project, it is literally everything I love about life and aspire to. So being able to be there was an unprecedented gift and I learned so much. <lj-cut text=""+++"">

The other weekend, I had to get up fucking early, drive out to get a piece of camera equipment I'd left in Tracy's bag, and then get back to the camera rental place to return the GODFORSAKEN 70-200mm that my boss keeps making me rent because apparently it is the *only* lens that makes you a valid photographer. I had to return that before noon. And then I got all these emails about doing ""training"" (read: unpaid) that she still expects me to rent a lens for? I mean, what? She's paid me before and there's NO way I've gotten worse since then so it makes absolutely zero sense. She is just incredibly cheap. I'm not going to LOSE money to make your business better. I've learned some things, yes, but I feel like I've hit a plateau in general photography knowledge from her and anything I ""learn"" from this point on is only going to help me take photos that fit her personal brand. Like it doesn't make me a better photographer in general, it just makes me shoot/crop exactly like her. Which is fine if I'm going to get paid for it, it's your business, whatever, but don't act like it's a huge privilege to learn (I got the ""I get emails all the time from people asking me to teach them - I always say no because I have NO time or I make them pay ME to come shoot a wedding and learn from me"" talk - I am so sick of hearing that shit, DOES IT ACTUALLY WORK ON PEOPLE?!). Since I do her color correcting too, I see a large volume of her work and some of the shots she's given me to work with are more awful than I was the very first day I picked up a camera. Never even MIND the fact that she doesn't ever actually train me; half the time I'm there she leaves before the reception! Training my <i>ass</i>!

ANYWAY. I was driving to meet my mom for lunch, just thinking about how shitty the situation is and how sick I am of it, literally on the verge of tears... when I get this email from Jordan Matter, saying that he's is going to be in Minneapolis shooting Dancers Among Us tomorrow and he would like me to come along. I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS EVEN UNDERSTAND. It came at the exact moment that I needed it so much. And it just stuns me how every time I've had a really awful artistic work experience, something comes along to even it out. It also made all the difference to me because it seems like in the past two years especially, every time I've been passionate about something in the real world and taken initiative about it, I've either been completely shit on or taken advantage of. But no - I just emailed him when I heard he was coming, I didn't ask for anything I just said I was a huge fan of the project and to let me know if I could do anything for him. I was thinking along the lines of spreading the word to local dancers or suggesting cool places to shoot, picking him up from the airport or suggesting a good restaurant, even, but he invited me to come and like, what a fucking cool human being and professional.

After the initial elation wore off, I was nervous as hell (""what if he wants me to like, bring him equipment that I'm not familiar with and I look like a fucking idiot"", ""what if he's mean or looks down on me because I'm young"", etc etc.) The day of the shoot, I tried not to think about anything along those lines and instead focus all of my energy into getting ready. It sounds shallow and stupid and it's not like I was trying to ~impress~ or anything but it was the only thing that helped me not be so nervous; if I'm running around the house looking for stuff, I don't have time to stare off into the abyss of nervousness. I got to his hotel and waited in the lobby as I was told, I was scared he'd leave without me or I'd never see him and he'd assume I was a no-show, IDEK. But then I heard him so I turned a corner and introduced myself and the first thing he said afterward was, ""Do whatever you want, shoot whatever you want and if you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask."" which was <i>amazing</i>. I brought my camera but left it in the car because I wasn't sure what he wanted or expected for the day. But he gave me complete freedom and was so fucking nice in general, we had a blast. There was another photographer there my age that had also emailed him. She was a total fangirl too and when we went from location to location, I drove her with me and we just geeked out the entire time about how cool this was and how much we love him lol. RL fangirling FTW!

He said one of the hidden prizes of doing this project is that he gets to smoke, lol - he has a rule that when he gets to a location, he lights a cigarette and has to have come up with his shot/story by the time it's over. I love that. When I used to edit fanvideos, after they finished uploading I'd go for a drive and smoke a cigarette while email/comment alerts were sent to my phone. I miss that. It sounds stupid and I know they're unhealthy but smoking sometimes makes me feel like such a fucking artist, you know. Whether they're connected to artistic ritual or even just an assist to prime Liss!time coupled with deep thought, they feel so existential and shit. I didn't do it super regularly and don't do it at all anymore because Jason ruins it but still. /tangent. At one point he gave me his phone and asked me to shoot video, which was cool. He wanted to stage a celebration like ""Whoo! We got the shot! *high fives, etc* "" So I filmed that and then I was like, ""Okay let's do it again, except this time start right there and walk into frame as you're saying it."" Like, it must have been a testament to how cool he was and how relaxed and comfortable I felt because it just fucking came out. I think it's a mix of ease with the fact that I'm becoming more confident in situations like this. I almost felt bad, like, ""shit I just directed him in his own damn video"" but he was like, ""Wow, art director! Love it!!"" and then did exactly what I'd asked. Such a fun moment. He also asked me to jump in his shot!

I wrote a blog on my website about the day so I don't want to get redundant but it was a great day. I had to drive him back to his hotel, I was fucking mortified by my car but THANK EVER-LOVING GOD my mother made me clean it out the day before when we were at lunch. We had time to kill so she was like, ""Let's find a trash can and take all the garbage out of your car."" lol god. So on the way, I told him that I loved watching him work because he's so great at things I'm still struggling with. ""Like what?"" he asked, and then just frickin' talked to me about how to fix it all. Amazing, amazing.</lj-cut>

I got home and was so high and hyper and happy, I need to work with more people like him, people who make me feel <i>that</i> way instead of stressed and resentful and taken advantage of. Jason and I walked to dinner downtown but I could not at all focus on life! It was wonderful! He'd asked us to send him photos from the day as he was leaving, so I turned around my 8 favorites for him that same night. He replied saying that he ""seriously loved these"" and that one of them was one of his favorites ever. Which was MORE than enough to make me happy, but then he posted that photo on his Facebook page, and not only did he give me credit, he searched on Facebook to find my photography page so he could actually link to it. Like, the respect and extra effort, I cannot. And then! He <i>liked</i> my page on his personal account. And followed me on Twitter. The woman I work for and communicate with on a daily basis has not even done any of those things. It really puts shit into perspective.

He blogged about the day and included some of my photos, again with credit. Like damn, dude, he didn't even need to because I had so much fun I didn't even care. I also <a href=""http://alyssakristine.com/blog/2012/10/06/five-things-i-learned-in-five-hours-with-jordan-matter/"">wrote a blog post</a> on my website and, because he'd followed my photography page, he saw when I posted it. And then this happened (screenshots mainly so I can keep them somewhere safe)

&rarr; Last Saturday <b>I shot a wedding</b>. It was really hectic and I was so overwhelmed, but it was the first wedding that I've gotten to shoot with <a href=""http://lissie-pissie.livejournal.com/tag/family%20-%20tracy"">Tracy</a> so it made all the difference having her there. I'm getting increasingly frustrated working for someone else, she's really nice but she's disorganized and kind of manipulative, I feel taken advantage of but I'm getting much better at saying no - because I don't really care anymore? Of course I care and do the best job I can, but I'm not like I was at the beginning, where I wanted the job so badly and wanted to work for her so badly. Now I could go either way, you know? LOL. But the wedding was beautiful. One of my favorite photos -

<small>Click for bigger... the detail is the best part.</small></center>
&rarr; Last Sunday, <b>we had our auditions</b>. Jason woke me up and I couldn't fall back asleep, and then we realized that my mic was back at my house 30 minutes away. We were just going to buy another one but then we saw that they were $250! I was like, ""OH MY GOD ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I CAN'T BELIEVE HE JUST GAVE IT TO ME"" because I GOT my mic from one of the crew I was working with in LA (the one that like, took me out and then gave me a lecture about how people would kill to be in my position and beg him all the time lolllll), he literally just asked if I had one and then just gave it to me. Jason was like, ""Well, he was trying to bone you at the time so if he's going to be a tool, take advantage."" LOL. So obviously I had to drive out and get that. Then one of our actors had to come early at the last minute so that was super stressful in that I had to rush back downtown and also no longer had time to get the sandwich I was exceptionally excited about lol. It went well - we had a lunch a week later and nailed down our cast, we're hoping to shoot in early November or even sooner, fingers crossed!

&rarr; After those were done we had less than an hour to clean and decorate the entire apartment for our <b>Dexter premiere party</b>.  <lj-cut text=""+ pics +"">Jason had to rush to the store and I had to clean and I still had not eaten anything all day and also I was super sore from that wedding. I cannot. I WAS SO OUT OF IT, I was trying to shooting our killer cupcakes, I tried to change the white balance on my camera but I literally COULD NOT REMEMBER how to do it for literally two minutes. That's how tired and fried my brain was. It was fun though - we draped our apartment in plastic, Ali brought the cupcakes and edible ""band aids"", Shane brought blood for us to make blood slide marks on our faces, Emily brought a box of Life with a knife through it (cereal killer) and little chocolate pandas (Dark Passengers, lol), we had red wine and burgers, it was a good time but it was a bummer it was on a Sunday night and people are adults with jobs now. :(

&rarr; The next day, I had to get up fucking early, drive out to get a piece of camera equipment I'd left in Tracy's bag, and then get back to the camera rental place to return the GODFORSAKEN 70-200mm that my boss keeps making me rent because apparently it is the only lens that makes you a wedding photographer. I had to return that before noon. And then I got all these work emails that just made me really upset, I'm so sick of renting that lens and I don't want to buy it, so... lkjsdfjlas. I met my mom for lunch, so that helped, as did THE BEST EMAIL that I'm saving for its own entry.</lj-cut>

<u>Awesome Purchases I've Made In The Past Week</u>
<b><a href=""http://www.preciousmoments.com/content.cfm/wonderful-wizard-of-oz"">Precious Moments; Wizard of Oz.</a></b> ARE YOU KIDDING ME. I was in the Hallmark store looking for a present for Ali's birthday when I saw them. My mom was on the phone with me when I saw them and the lady working there was laughing at how excited I was. My mom said she'd get them for me for Christmas and asked if they took credit cards over the phone lol. So it was this huge ordeal, I only picked out two but she told the lady that I could get them all and to tell me Merry Christmas. It was precious and she was so friendly, and they are ADORABLE YOU GUYS.
<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/lissiexanga/OZ.jpg"" width=""550""></center>
<b><a href=""http://www.maccosmetics.com/whats_new/9483/New-Collections/Marilyn-Monroe/index.tmpl"">Mac; Marilyn Monroe Collection.</a></b> Okay there was huge trauma with this. <lj-cut text=""+++"">I had known they were releasing this on the 4th of Oct. What I didn't know is that they were selling it online sooner than that. By the time I found out, everything was sold out and I literally cried because I thought they had moved the entire release up and there wouldn't even BE any in stores on Oct 4th. That morning, I got up super early and got to the closest Mac store at 9:05am, because that's what their hours were on their website. Sign on their door says no, open at 11. I WAS SO PISSED. I drove back downtown and walked to Macy's because they opened at 10. I was the first and only one there, so I was looking at the <i>glorious</i> make-up... when the worker came and started pulling shit off the shelves RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME before I'd even bought anything! ""... Are you doing phone orders when I'm standing here? Or what, how is this happening."" I asked. ""*shrugs* We just get what we get!"" Total fucking liar. 

I got a few things I wanted, I was happy for the most part but I still wanted my favorite eyeshadow. She told me that the Mac store ~in the mall~ sold out by 10:30am last Thursday or whatever. Um, again, I thought this shit came out Oct 4th, what is with all of these early dates and why did none of the announcements I'd read think to mention those? ""No, the big Mac stores had an early unveiling."" Great. On my walk back, I called the Mac store and just ASKED if they had any stuff left and she gave me a spiel about how they ""prioritize the customers that come in person"" and it's like bitch I'm just asking before I waste even more of my time on you. She claimed that yes, they had all the items in stock and I should get there early. So I drove BACK to the Mac store, was the first one there, DAMN. A few other girls showed up before open and they were so much fun, we were all fangirling it and showing off what we'd already procured. It was adorable.</lj-cut> I ended up with everything I wanted and it is so beautiful. Expensive as hell, I spent so much money but I never buy expensive make-up so I have 0% guilt.

<u>Films I've Seen Recently</u>
&rarr; <b>Perks of Being a Wallflower,</b> which I really really loved. I haven't read the book but the film makes me want to. Emma Watson is pretty and adorable but I did take some issue with some of her acting.
&rarr; And then on Saturday night, Jason and I watched <b>The Sitter, Frozen, Repeaters, Charlie Bartlett</b> consecutively (movie day - literally), and I loved those too, especially Frozen and Charlie Bartlett."

"event","<lj-cut text=""We wrapped the movie last Friday...."">We wrapped the movie last Friday. I was in an awful mood, tbh, mainly because I had just started my period and the woman I work weddings with was being an epic pain in my ass, I don't even remember what else but I was pretty pissed and fried before I even got there. So I walk onto set and one of the PA's is like, ""They're rehearsing now if you want to pop in."" So I went down the hall and tried to open the closed set door, when another PA (who had been a bitch pretty much the entire time) appeared out of nowhere, reached out in front of me and put her hand on the door - ""They're rehearsing right now, so we're not going to go in there."" Which is fine if she doesn't understand that, um, that's THE ONLY TIME I actually NEED to be there, but she said it like a total bitch, like I was some idiot. Normally I would have called her on it and if she continued to object I would have sent her to ask the producer what exactly I'm doing here, but I was ALREADY at the end of my rope so I just walked away. I went for a drive, I had no idea where I was so I just explored and it was <i>lovely</i>, I felt truly like myself again, which makes me think I need to spend more time alone. Jason is wonderful and I do get Liss!time when he's at work and I don't have shoots, but it's different.  I found a BEAUTIFUL lake with lots of sailboats, so I just sat there and watched the world go by.

When I went back, I was in a much better mood. It was the last day, and night shoots are always really fun. I had the photo prop I made with me - the day I shot & 'shopped it, I daydreamed wistfully of getting the actors to sign it, so I could frame it and put it up on the film/celebrity corner of my future photography studio. Just... as a photographer, that day was SUCH a blast for me, contributing like that and ending with such a beautiful, tangible, relevant piece of this whole experience. So I intended to get it signed. Problem was, I forgot about it in the midst of everything else and suddenly it was the day before the last, and then it was the last. So that was my main goal for the entire day. I hovered quite a bit, busy but constantly aware and looking for good moments to approach them. I got Matt and Nick first, who I weren't worried about - I knew they'd be cool with it, especially Nick who, again, I cannot say enough good things about. I was nervous about Janel Moloney, I saved her for last because I didn't know how she'd feel about it. Plus, she was rarely - if ever - alone/free/un-busy, as she was our lead. I caught a moment where she was sitting totally alone, but she was eating out of a take-out box and I didn't want to interrupt. I also tried to pay attention to the crew, because I didn't know how they'd feel about me ~asking for autographs~ even though that was not at all what it was about. I pretty much had an internal anxiety attack but I kept my shit together like a goddamn boss. Growing, I'm doing it. Later, she was sitting in video village with just the script supervisor, who I've known and worked with before so I felt comfortable joining their conversation. When there was a lull, I asked Janel to sign the contact sheet and she was SUPER nice about it, making conversation and calling me ""hun"" and all. And after that I was officially in THE BEST mood, because my goal of the day/shoot had been achieved. Kicking myself for not buying a silver Sharpie, but I'm still so happy. After that I just got to relax and enjoy the set and the people on our last night. I left at 3:45am, they didn't finish until 6, bless.

We had the wrap party on Saturday. Jason and I went out to Buca di Beppo for dinner beforehand, which was delicious - we ordered a MOUNTAIN of food and surprisingly ate it all; huge salad, garlic bread, ravioli, and mashed potatoes, which doesn't sound like a lot but each of those dishes is intended to be shared with a family of four lol. It was a very nice dinner, it reminded us of New Years Eve because we went there last year all fancy. The wrap party was at a Japanese restaurant downtown that I'd never been to or heard of. I didn't eat anything, obviously, but I had drinks, including some type of sweet Saki, which I've decided I DO NOT LIKE. I WAS SO HUNGOVER, I HAVE BEEN SO HUNGOVER THE THREE TIMES I'VE HAD SAKI. Anyway, it was <i>so much fun</i>, got to talk a lot with old and new friends. Nick asked me if I wanted a drink, so I told him and it was a beer he'd never heard of, he kept saying it over and over in his accent so he wouldn't forget lol. Janel and Matt came too which I thought was really cool. Matt introduced himself to Jas and was like, ""Nice to meet you. I've had a camera in my face for the past three weeks, courtesy of your girlfriend."" LOL. We spent a majority of the night up on the rooftop, it was a BREATHTAKINGLY PERFECT NIGHT; we've started having cold days here but this was perfect. It was 1:45am when we started leaving, people wanted to go dancing but it was too late so a bunch of people went to the director's house. Jas and I decided to go home, Bo gave us some shit about it, ""You guys look great, buuuut you're lame."" LOL. We came back to the apartment and played <a href=""http://www.looneylabs.com/games/oz-fluxx"">Wizard of Oz Fluxx</a> and then crashed. Hungover pretty much all day the next day but it was worth it.</lj-cut>

That got longer than intended; this was going to be a bullet point entry lol. So I'll finish up with other production developments and then do another RL entry:

&rarr; Jason and I had lunch with Marc today about our series. We're going to fundraise our pilot on Kickstarter, but before we do that, we're going to shoot a pitch video for it. We have a hilarious script, we have for awhile but we're <i>finally</i> moving forward with it - we're casting on Sunday and I am SO. EXCITED. We were talking today about how more than anything, this project is an excuse for us to work with people we really like. We are operating under the hope that we'll get funded and picked up and can eventually make it our full-time job to work with people we really like. It's a dream job for all of us, and we're finally, concretely starting, it feels <i>great</i>. I'm starting to be faced with how much work it's actually going to be and how it's going to force me to get better at things and grow; I had to call actors yesterday who I've never met, who've never heard of me, explain the project and ask if they wanted to audition. I hate calling people on the phone, especially people I don't know, but the fact that I work with people I really respect made me do it - things like that, this is the best environment for me to blossom and push myself because no one's going to be more accepting, helpful, and forgiving as these two. And in this industry, people like that are rare. I love this project. I'm starting to get nervous, but we'll see and I'll of course keep you updated!"

"event","My call time isn't until 4pm today so I have a few minutes to update! Going to talk about movie stuff because it is pretty much my brain right now. It's strange how you just get into this mode - or at least I do, where it's all I can work on or think about. I've gotten better at shutting it off, but it's still there and the reason it's weird to me is that up until the first day of shooting, I was not involved at all this time. ANYWAY! A few little notes and moments!

<b>o1.</b> There's always a lot of talent behind the camera. That combined with downtime equals lots of fun and learning. I've gotten a guitar lesson just... out of boredom, and have agreed to trade head shots for ballroom dance lessons. <lj-cut text=""+++ lots of dance in these here parts +++"">The first day, I was talking to the male stand-in, and I asked him what he does for a living (obviously there is not enough work here lmao). ""I teach ballroom dance."" My jaw fell open. Are you fucking kidding me?! We talked loads about dance and all, and then a few days later he asked me how much I charge for head shots. I told him but then added, ""... but I'd be more than happy to trade for a dance lesson!"" He was totally into it and asked if my boyfriend would want to learn too. I told him I'm not sure - he says he does but I don't think he actually does as much as he wants to just make me happy. Plus I worry that he'd hold me back, if I'm being really honest. I just have a lot of dance experience and don't want to stay in the basics of ballroom any longer than I have to. Yesterday, he came up and asked if I was serious about trading head shots for lessons. ""I was dead serious."" ""Okay so sometime today when you don't have anything going on, find me and I'll give you a movement exercise to practice."" He had been whistling and absent-mindedly doing merengue all day so I was like, ""Is it this? *does knee thing I learned when we did merengue on Culture Day in spanish class lol*"" ""Aha!"" he pointed and knew. ""No, it's more of a shifting weight exercise. And it teaches you to shut your mind off, you can't anticipate - you have to let the guy lead and follow his movements."" I told him I am not that kind of girl, lol. He laughed and said ""You should be!"" Which kind of bugged but whatever. I left early but I'm sure there'll be time for it. He also said that my long legs would lend themselves to a mean waltz and I am ALL ABOUT THAT. I was better at ballet and lyrical than other dance types so while I really want to get into the feisty side of it I feel like I'd really love and be good at waltz.

Speaking of dance, yesterday we were shooting in a school, in their dorms. Our actor, who will get his own bullet point because he is SO incredibly pleasant, grounded, and fun, kind of was tapping his feet and I pointed and said, ""Tap shoes?"" totally joking. He nonchalantly busted into an actual tap step and I was like, ""Oh my god! You actually do tap!"" So then we talked about tap and he asked me if I'd ever heard of a stage show called Tap Dogs? It's from Australia but I looked it up and it is AWESOME. Also, this happened - 

<center><lj-embed id=""348""/></center>
So, never mind the fact that I'm surrounded by fun people, I am quite surrounded by dance on this set as well. &hearts;</lj-cut>

<b>o2.</b> We had a day where we shot in the water, the lake. It was so much fun. Kicking off our shoes and walking right in with all of our equipment, rejecting the standard 9-to-5 to play in the sun and work 'til 4am, we are perpetual children.

<b>o3.</b> We have a four year old actor. Kids on set are one of my favorite things IN THE KNOWN UNIVERSE. I posted <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=366563646756673&amp;set=a.121911644555209.30097.120990731313967&amp;type=1&amp;theater"">a photo</a> on my page but oh man. There's a scene where he has to run down a path and after a couple of takes, we tried to put his sweater on to do another and he clung to his mother's legs - ""NO! No! NOOOOO!"" We all stood there waiting for the diva!fit to end, others must have been far more used to it than I because I had to work very hard to cover up the fact that I was cracking up. Then today, I overheard his mom telling the director that on the way over this morning, he said, ""Mommy, I'm not sure I want to do my play today."" lol I'm dying shut up. He did it like a champion though. He's got this monkey that he brings with him everywhere and the director knows its name and like addresses it and shit, I cannot. He was playing Jenga in the middle of the floor and his mom asked him if his monkey was friends with a stuffed monkey they were using as set dressing. He didn't really respond so I picked up the monkey, made a super-exaggerated kiss sound as I pressed it to his cheek. He died laughing, he was so happy! &hearts;! Seriously, MY FAVORITE. Then, one of his daycare playmates in the scene, I think she was seven years old, started telling me about how she ""read part of the script. It's a good script. It's kind of sad though, because I have to yell at a boy who has autism."" SO cute, she was so smart.

<b>o4.</b> The father in the story is a photographer, and there's a scene where he looks at a proof sheet of his family. So I actually got to direct and take those photos before creating the proof sheet to be used in an insert shot. It was a BLAST. Then, they dressed our leads up in wedding clothes and I got to direct a mini wedding shoot! People lit it for me and everything, it turned out SO GREAT, I need a gaffer ALL THE TIME. It really did show me how much I need to learn professional lighting. Natural is great and all but seeing how photos turn out with intentional lighting... shit. It was so fun though and I really did take everyone by surprise by how comfortable and take-charge I was when they turned it over to me. I also don't think anyone knows I do wedding photos IRL lol. I heard them murmuring about it as I was working and then had several people tell me after the fact, too. I'm not trying to sound all ""~I'm the shit~"", it's just a huge deal for me and something I hold dear because I would <i>not</i> have been that way a year ago. I would have freaked the fuck out and just given my camera to the DP. But now it was quite easy, I was confident. Plus hello, beautiful people are beautiful and get to add make-up artists on top of that - it really was a fucking dream, you guys. Then we put the couple in Christmas sweaters for another photo shoot and I took some of them just dicking around, oh my god it looks like a fucking Gap ad. IT KILLS ME I CAN'T POST THEM but if they ever put them up on their production page or website, I can definitely link you and if worse comes to worse, you can see them in the film lol. They were up on the set today!~ &hearts;

<b>o5.</b> Lead actor, Nicholas Bishop, is SO pleasant and kind. He came on one of the first days - he wasn't even in any of the scenes, he came just to hang out. He brought his own camera, came over and introduced himself, and assured me that he wasn't trying to step on my toes, he just brings his camera to everything he works on. That really impressed me because it seems that in the past, no one's given a shit about stepping on my toes lol. And here, people do. These little moments and tiny milestones, I'll always look back on them. <lj-cut text=""+++"">We've talked a bit over the past couple of weeks, there was a great time I was editing photos on an empty set, he came and sat down and asked me what I like to shoot most. I asked him the same question (spaces, buildings and tunnels, he said) and he showed me a photo he'd recently taken of a music stand in a backlit tunnel, with the musician down in the background. I told him I loved shooting events and the arts, he asked if my background was in dance. I told him about how I get stupidly attached to wedding couples even though I will never see them again. ""I imagine it makes the photos better, though,"" he says. Another day, he came up and asked if I had a light meter. I said no, thinking he wanted to borrow it if it I did, but he ended up recommending me an app for my phone. 

He's taken a phone!photo of everyone on the crew and put a filter on it that turns it into a cartoon, he wants to make a crew book or contact sheet of all of them, what a FUN idea, I really hope he does! Just, what a sweet guy! He's so present and involved, he feels like he's a part of the crew too. It's strange - when you work on a film, you get close to people in such a short amount of time - the hours are so long, you shoot 5 or 6 consecutive, 12+ hour days at at time, that during the shoot it doesn't really occur to you that there's an end date and you will never see some of these people ever again. Some you will, especially here because the film community is fairly small, but others... you just won't. It's very sad. I've never really bonded with an actor before, but this guy and his presence, his approachability, his smile and his ease around people, even though he's ~talent~... it inspires me so much. Out of everyone, I think I'll miss him the most.

Our other actor, Matt Kane, is so sweet as well. He's from the UK so he's got this fantastic accent, on the first day he saw me in a hallway and walked over to introduce himself. We haven't talked AS much, but I need to note my favorite thing - day 1, we were filming in a VERY tiny, hot apartment. We can't have the A/C on because it interferes with sound. So after one take, someone says they need to get make-up in there to powder him. He says, ""I must apologize for my perspiration!"" all dead serious in his accent, I died, I <i>died</i>. SUCH a sweet guy, and such a gentleman - holding doors for me even after I insist he go on through.</lj-cut>

<b>o6.</b> They used me as background in an accident scene, I had to walk across and react, lol. Then, a couple of days ago, I got to be in a scene at a care facility. I had autism and they assigned me fake parents and everything. It was quite fun. Then, then!! One of our ~sponsors~ is a hair stylist and his new special hair trailer has been on set every day. But on Monday, I got to go in it and get a hair blow-out! The local news came to film it and interview me! OH MY GOD MY HAIR LOOKED SO BOSS. I don't think I'll get blow-outs regularly because I feel like my hair is too fine/weak for it, but it did look great. What cool little unexpected perks there always are.

Night shoot today! We only have like three days left :("

"event","Earlier tonight I had a mini-breakdown just from being stressed out and busy, and also having an ongoing health issue. I was crying and felt like I was excessively dramatic, so I apologized to Jason for being a handful and thanked him for understanding and being there for me. He left to get me wine and when he got back, I was photoshopping in bed. He handed me a glass, we talked about wine for a minute before he leaned in and put his hand on the side of my face.

<i><b>""I would take you for the rest of my life, on your worst day,""</b> he says.</i>

I cried again."

"event","I HAVE A NEW SYSTEM, WE WILL SEE IF IT WORKS - I decided that the time from when I wake up to the time that Jason comes home for lunch will be blogging/personal photo time. Then from the time he leaves until 5pm will be work time - color correcting, redoing my website, finally getting a logo (you'd think it'd be easy for me but I actually have a really hard time with logos, I am not good at them), picking colors and branding myself etc. But nao it's the weekend so none of that matters. I just wanted to tell you.

&rarr; I went and got pedicures with my grandma. It was so cute, I texted her asking if she wanted to and she said yes. I invited my cousin, who brought her sister, and all four of us went. My grandma didn't even get one because she's embarrassed of her feet (I've had a pedicure with her before so I thought she was cool with it, but that was in her impulsive stage lol), and she still took us. I told her I felt bad she wasn't getting one and she was like, ""No - *gestures to us* how neat is this for a grandma?"" &hearts; &hearts; She kept coming over to talk to each of us, she's so sweet I can't even. P.S. <A HREF=""https://twitter.com/bugsyjean"">you can follow her on Twitter</a>. We went back to her house, where I tried to pay her for my pedicure since it was my idea and I just got paid. Like I would have gotten a pedicure anyway, you know? I budgeted for that. She was not having any of it, she's just like her mother, ""Alyssa. No. Alyssa, I would be <i>offended</i>, okay."" l;kadjsflk;aj and she was serious. We went to my mom's bf's bar for dinner, and then she sent me a text at like 10:30 - ""I really enjoyed spending quality time with u today. Thanx. I love you so much Liss!!"" &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; 

&rarr; Jason and I had a rough week. It was the first time he's ever actually been a dick to me. <lj-cut text=""+++ there were a few separate occasions where he said some shit +++"">First, there was <A HREF=""http://lissie-pissie.livejournal.com/1035022.html"">this fight</a>, where he asked if I was going to be mad at him all weekend, I said no, just until he apologized, and then he was all, ""OH, so all weekend then."" We got over it, but then that following week, he came home for lunch one day - I was playing video games when he walked in and I was having a hard time, so I was sort of cursing to myself. And he yelled from the kitchen, ""Honey? This is not the relaxing lunch hour I had in mind."" Which is fair, to a degree, but his tone was dickish and not at all like him. And I've told him time and time again that me being a passionate person isn't always going to be ""good passion"" or passion about things he likes. Though that's one of the things he loves most about me, he needs to take the good with the bad. 

THEN, we were playing video games some night, we'd had a couple of drinks and we were playing cooperative mode. He kept playing a level we didn't have to beat, and kept dying really stupid deaths on it so I told him to play the levels we need to play so we can get to a save point and not have to repeat these past 10. Like it was pretty fucking logical because I knew he would just go to bed when we got a game over and I'd be stuck doing it alone and I couldn't do half of them myself. LOL all of this sounds so stupid reading it back but really, I was irritated. ""Wow - you can make anything unfun, can't you,"" he says, and he was dead serious. What the fuck, ""anything""? Like, do you frequently have this thought? What else do I make ""unfun"" and why the fuck are you even with me, then. And you know, if my ex Randy had said that to me, it'd roll right off, I'd retaliate and it'd be fine but that coming from Jason was really, really hurtful. Because it's Jason, and he is never, EVER mean or disrespectful. I started crying because I didn't know what to make of it. He felt really bad. When I woke up, he'd left a note on my computer about how sorry he was and how ""all my time with you is fun, precious, and never enough."" It was just awful, and he continues to be really sensitive. I know I need to take my own advice and accept that the same sensitivity that allows him to be so kind and artistic and in tune to me is the same sensitivity that hurts his feelings when I jokingly call him an asshole even though he knows I don't mean it.

Like we were play!fighting over something, like wrestling for a piece of paper or something stupid, and I called him an ass even though I was blatantly NOT SERIOUS and we were laughing. He says it bothers him, even when I joke, and he thinks it goes back to his (FUCKING AWFUL) mother because she's really harsh and says mean shit to him. And you know, I'd be understanding if it wasn't so hypocritical - when he met me, he had some habits that really scared me (like needing sleeping pills and taking shots of vodka to sleep at night) because they reminded me of my dad. And he was all, ""I'm not your dad, it's not fair to judge me based on his mistakes, etc etc."" Well, I'm not your mom, either.</lj-cut>

&rarr; I think he was just really stressed with work, which he admitted to, and to unfairly taking it out on me. He had to present his new software designs to their board of directors in Chicago this past Wednesday. We went ~suit shopping~ that Monday night, and everything there was BOGO so he got TWO suits!1 that he looked super great in, and bright blue and purple shirts - I love that he gravitated toward color because I love it when guys wear vibrant colors. The salesman picked out a pair of shoes and when he pulled them out of the box, Jason mouthed ""NO."" to me, but they ended up looking damn awesome and he bought them lol. He was only gone for 24 hours, when he got home I took him out to dinner in his new suit. Our waitress pissed me off - she asked for his ID and he was like, ""But I'm wearing a suit! LOL"" And she was like, ""That proves nothing!"" So he got it out for her and said, ""I'm just proud of my new suit."" And instead of saying something nice, she just says - seriously - ""Now all you need is a haircut."" And it broke my heart because he was so sweet and kind and proud of how good he looked and she didn't acknowledge it at all, just knocked it. If it were one of her friends, fine, but it was her customer. And I love his hair. So on the ""Tip:"" line of the check I wrote ""Get a haircut."" Because she was a fucking bitch and I don't give a fuck if servers ~make minimum wage~, if they are dicks, they don't get tips.

&rarr; I have been watching Teen Mom for pretty much the past three days lol. And can we talk about SYTYCD?! The Mia Michaels episode?! HELLO. NEW STAPLE OF MY ARTISTIC WORK DAY. I am so in love with her and everything she stands for. Also, Travis Wall, I cannot even with Travis Wall. I am so butthurt they sent Amelia home, she was my favorite, and just so they could keep Witney 2.0, The Less Hot Version? Are you kidding me?"

"event","I shot a wedding this weekend - it was a referral from a friend, Molly, her cousin was getting married. And despite totally screwing up the time for our first meeting, I got the job. I was flipping through my mini-portfolio for her and said, ""I can pull more images for you if you'd like--"", she interrupted to say, ""Oh, no, I am completely confident."" And that was so nice, it made me feel amazing because I was totally late and I'm young and whatever. This family was SO. INCREDIBLY. NICE. to work with. They made me fall in love with this job all over again. I've got to say, I've been a little stressed out working for someone else lately - don't get me wrong, it's nice to have ""steady"" freelance work, she's very sweet and I'm learning a lot, I'm just... I'm meant to work for myself. I was so much happier all day, shooting what *I* find beautiful and what *I* would want as a bride instead of shooting what someone else tells me to.  Every day I get closer and closer to just branding myself and making ads and just blazing through non-stop. I've already become much more productive with the whole ""work at home"" mindset, and I like it. We'll get there.

I drove through my city at 8am on a Saturday - it was dead, except for one amazing woman, <i>dancing on a street corner</i>, by herself, with her headphones on. That simple thing set the tone for my entire day. It put me in such a great mood even though I was tired (I slept like absolute SHIT the night before, you guys) and nervous. I had to be at the mother's house at 8:30 for hair and make-up. The bride and groom have an adorable two year old, and I was super excited about him because I've never shot a wedding where the couple had a kid already. AND HE HAD THE TINIEST TUX, YOU GUYS, I COULD NOT FUCKING GET OVER IT - 

<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/lissiexanga/DSC_2038.jpg"" width=""272""> <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/lissiexanga/DSC_2217.jpg"" width=""272"">

<lj-cut text=""+++ recap &amp; more photos +++""></center>Everyone was in a panic because the woman who was supposed to do the bridesmaids' hair just... didn't show up. And they could not find her anywhere. And her phone was off. Like... who does that. She finally called and said ""her phone was on silent and her alarm didn't go off~"" lol okay, I set 3 alarms and had Jason set an alarm on his phone too. This crisis really cut into my couple shoot time, but they understood that. I have to give the bride props for keeping her cool. She flat out was just like, ""No, it's fine, we figured it out. Don't come to the wedding."" lol. It was one of her friends, I think, and then she called like all the other bridesmaids crying and shit and I was like, ""Lol tell her to stop making it about her."" Some people are of the mind that photographers shouldn't be seen and especially shouldn't be heard, that a good photographer moves about unnoticed - and I disagree with that. I've found that I take better photos of people I have a connection with, and people also make better subjects when they know me. It builds trust, and everyone is so much happier.

The church was just down the road, the ceremony was fairly quick. I had a camera issue at an awful time - a few cute photos came out way dark but I think I'll be able to save them in black & white. Bright side is, next time it happens I'll know what to check for.

<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/lissiexanga/1-11.jpg"" width=""272""> <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/lissiexanga/GraceAndy01-1.jpg"" width=""272""></center>

There was a simple reception at the church itself, then we went back to the mother of the bride's house for an hour or so to wait for the limos. My friend Molly was like, ""Liss there's beer behind you!"" And I was like, ""Well technically I'm working, so..."" There wasn't a lot going on to shoot - I went out on the deck where a few people were hanging out, took a couple of photos and then one of the uncles, I think, started asking me if I do a lot of weddings, if I went to school for it, etc. Super nice and genuinely interested. And everyone on the deck was watching/participating in this conversation. I thought that was really sweet and again, just made everybody comfortable and that shows through in the photos. I went back in the house and Molly's mom asked, ""Are you allowed to have a drink with us?"" I said it was fine, I was working, and she and a couple of other people were like, ""We don't care!"" Just a super easy going, enjoyable family.

We went back to the church, where the limos were late - they had to have two, I think because it was a last-minute booking or something, but the girls went in one and the guys went in another. I rode with the girls and I loved them, we had a really good time and I wish they were my group of friends, lol. One of the bridesmaids especially, she was SO much fun, so animated and full of personality.

<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/lissiexanga/DSC_3126.jpg"" width=""550""></center>
I don't know why Photobucket keeps making my color look like shit on these. But I know you know me better than that, journal. 

We took the limos to a boat launch, where there was a smaller, more traditional reception. In my original meeting, they said that if I went on the boat cruise, I'd run over 8 hours (which is what my package includes), so if I didn't want to, they'd understand but if I did, that I could bring a date. So Jason met me at the launch. And again, everyone was so nice! ""Is this your boyfriend?? Hi!"" and offering to take pictures of <i>us</i> -

<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/lissiexanga/DSC_3623.jpg"" width=""550""></center>
... they were so completely why <i>I love this job</i>. It's about connecting with people and witnessing <i>people</i> as they are, not being some cookie-cutter factory. I realize the factories make more money but they don't feel this priceless fucking <i>joy</i>. And even in spite of the fact that I'm still a ""starving artist"", I still can't believe I got paid that much to have fun and meet these great people. One of the guests had me type my Facebook page into his phone, and the father of the groom offered to buy me a drink. And then, when I was shooting on the upper deck at one point, I was freezing - Jason was standing behind me rubbing my arms up and down super fast - and two separate men ran over with their jackets. I mean, <i>really</i>. I can't even.

They did dinner on the boat, which was fantastic. We ate with Molly and her boyfriend, it was a really nice break. OH there was some drama - one of the groomsmen punched the brother of the bride IN THE FACE, his glasses flew overboard and his nose started gushing blood all over the floor. I saw the entire thing. People asked me if I shot it and it's like, um, <i>no</i>. It was hard because it was action, you know, something was *happening* but it was so awful. I stopped even looking, I tried to get off the front point of the boat but oblivious people were blocking the stairs so I was stuck there trying not to get blood on my shoes. But other than that altercation, it was a good time and everyone was really happy.

They did their dances and toasts as the sun came down, it was beautiful. We got back in at 9ish, so it was a 12 hour day for me but it flew by. It always does. It started to POUR a few minutes after we left, thankfully we were off the boat BUT I had left my car windows cracked. :/ Since we drove separately, I told Jason that I had to get gas on the way home. He followed me to the gas station and after I pulled up to the pump, I dealt with a text and started digging in my purse for my card. When I got out, I noticed that he was there getting my pump ready. I expected him to just stay in the car, especially because I was covered by a roof and protected by rain, but he got his shirt wet just to be a gentleman when it wasn't even necessary. I cannot even. Little things like that all the time, he continues to impress me and I can't believe what a heart he has and how much he loves me.</lj-cut>"

"event","It's been nearly a month since I updated last. I suck, I'm busy, and it's also hard to stay motivated/care when I feel like basically no one is here anymore. I need to make time for blogging for <i>me</i> - I think I take for granted the fact that I can think of a moment from the past few years and then look up whatever details I'm struggling to remember. Next year, though, I won't have that luxury if I keep on like this. Highlights (mostly weekends and then a few randoms) to get caught up so I'm less intimidated:

&rarr; <b>Went to my friend Sarah's wedding in Michigan</b>. It was a long drive, we got lost in Chicago, blah blah, stopped for amazing cheese curds, listened to Mysterious Universe podcast, you know, the usual. We stayed with Jason's aunt, who is really sweet and probably the most normal person in his family, tbh. She had a 5 year old daughter who was a goddamn trip - SUCH a little spitfire and full of so much energy. The second day we were there, I heard a door creak in the morning but I assumed it was the bathroom. I rolled over 5 minutes later and saw her just standing at the end of our bed. It was creepy as shit but I just burst out laughing. The wedding was beautiful, Sarah was my first good girl friend to get married, it was so weird and I cried. The reception was open bar, I had a great time with Erin & Katie, who were the only other girls in our group of friends to make the trek. I took pictures, of course!

&rarr; <b>Went to my aunt's cabin.</b> I had never been there but it was beautiful. I was pretty miserable though, tbh, because <lj-cut text=""[TMI]"">I had my first pap smear, which was fucking TRAUMATIC, okay, and it turns out that a bladder infection turned into a different infection and I had to get antibiotics. Not pills. It was disgusting and super uncomfortable so I'm hoping it's fine now. I noticed it when sex started HURTING LIKE HELL. And then even when I was off meds and ""better"", I couldn't have sex but I'm hoping it was all in my head because I had become so scared of it/associating it with pain, IDEK. Anyway, so that really put a damper on my cabin time. Also I slept like shit, bugs and so much noise. The main drama of the weekend was that my dog (tiny little Maltese) could not stop humping their golden lab. Seriously, he was fucking RABID about it too, to the point where when we pulled him away or he ever even SAW the dog, he'd claw at windows and scream. Ridiculous. I told everyone to just not give a shit about it but my sister was so stressed out, crying and shit and it's like, who cares.</lj-cut>

&rarr; <b>Turned twenty-four.</b> Last Saturday. Jason came home at lunch on Friday with roses. I thought he was a day early but knew it wasn't like him. ""Happy birthday! It starts now!"" he says. &hearts; He took the afternoon off of work. We went to dinner at a restaurant that has LEGENDARY french fries, and I also had banana bread beer, which is exactly what it sounds like! It was delicious!! We went to the place that has the epic strawberry gelato - we called that morning and asked if they had it, and asked them to save a quart for us, put it aside so no one else would buy it. We got there, and they didn't have it. Or any left. A wonderful worker went to check in back and dug us some out of the freezer. &hearts; 

<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/lissiexanga/DSC_0686-1.jpg"" width=""550""></center>
I woke up to breakfast in bed. &hearts; I didn't know what I wanted to do for my actual birthday, I usually go to the zoo but we just went when Gem was here. Jason suggested we go shopping and I was game. I thought we were going just for something to do, but he bought me anything I wanted. I didn't take advantage and insisted on paying for my work pants, but it still felt like a fairytale. He is the sweetest. We went out at night, we had a great time but I was disappointed in some of my friends for saying they'd be there and then not showing. ""It's my dad's birthday too so we're going to dinner"" - did you not know your dad's birthday was that day when you RSVP'd yes? Shit like that. Whatever. I had a great dress and got to wear my new birthday shoes. My mom and her boyfriend, my sister and a date, Ali, Jason & I had drinks and red velvet cake before we walked to the comedy club. It blew because you weren't allowed to be perverted, it was their ""family-safe improv show~"" STUPID. Ali drove us all back here, we drank moar, ordered a late night pizza, and watched Dumb & Dumber. Angela and her date stayed over, because we has a great couch now! She sang me an adorable birthday song she wrote to the tune of Call Me Maybe as she presented me with birthday riesling. It was precious.

&rarr; <b>Went to Jason's friend Paul's cabin.</b> It was like a three hour drive and we got in a huge fight on the way up there. He was driving like a dick and I have asked him numerous times why he keeps accelerating when the cars in front of us lay on their break lights. And he's still doing it, it scares me, at finally I was like, ""God! *grabs door handles in fear*"" He was all, ""If you want to drive, you can,"" which would have been fine, but he KEPT going even after I offered no bitching or protest - ""and I can just sit there and ~chill and play on my phone"" or something. So we were pissed and after like 10 minutes of silence he was like, ""So are you going to me mad at me all weekend?"" I replied, ""No, probably just until you apologize."" He goes, ""So all weekend, then."" DICK. Like I'm sorry your car is a piece of crap and it SCARES ME that not only do you not start breaking or take your foot off the gas at the VERY least, you go FASTER towards a STAGNANT OBJECT.

Cabin was really fun though, we were so glad we went. I got so drunk the first night we were there, and let me tell you it is THE WORST when you are sleeping in a guest cabin full of people and you feel the need to throw up in the morning. I didn't, but it was traumatic. I felt good enough to go to on the boat after breakfast though, so it was all good. We spent the entire first day on the water, my scalp is MAJORLY sunburned and his friend pissed me off with the jet ski but it was a very nice, warm day. Pictures~

I really wish I would have had more time. Not to shoot it, because he gave me all I wanted but my legs were starting to give out at that point, I am <i>that</i> out of shape. It breaks my heart. I always say I'm going to get back into it and those two little firecrackers on SYTYCD this season really make me want to get into ballroom. I've always wanted to do ballroom but I'm getting pretty close to being serious about it this time. I wish I would have had more time to get to know the music and the dock especially, because it was fucking scary and I think that comes across a little, lol. I'm glad I did it though!"

The night before Independence Day was spent down the street at this <b>local carnival</b> they put on every year. It's walking distance from my house, which is very cool because parking would be a bitch. My friend Mary had been teaching in Thailand, so I haven't seen her in years but she was there. Molly, Ali, and Teresa came, Tony and his sister showed up, as did Derek and Brian - we just got several pitchers of beer and ""enjoyed"" the weather (it was so hot I couldn't even take photos for awhile, my lens was too foggy!). Jason and I walked home and then <lj-cut text=""got in one of our biggest fights ever."">got in one of our biggest fights ever because I dared to care about him and his feelings. He had been so antisocial and lame all night, of course I asked him a couple of times if he was okay or if he wanted to go home. And I was very sincere about it too, like I wasn't bitchy and judgmental, I assured him it'd be completely fine if he wanted to leave. 

So we got in a fight about it and we were yelling, it was awful, he told me to stop asking so I was like, ""Fine, done caring, dropping it."" He was like, ""YOU CONSTANTLY GO FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER."" Well, fine, but it's better than being fucking lukewarm about everything, I told him I'm not apologizing for it and if he can't handle it then this isn't going to work - it's how I live my life. Everything is huge. It's what makes an artist, it's what makes me good at my job, it's what makes me more alive than most other people I know. Unfortunately, the same huge feeling applies to bad things too sometimes. Like... deal with it. And another huge reason I was frustrated was because I know if I DIDN'T keep checking in on him, he'd be butthurt about that, too. He'd be generally quiet and mopey until it came out and ""You totally ignored me! You acted like I wasn't even there!"" He claims he wouldn't but I've seen it happen. So IDEK, I said I was done with it and went upstairs to let us both cool off. When I came back down 10 minutes later, he was just gone? It was so not like him, it was awful. Turns out, he had gone to the store to get corn since I had been talking all night about how I wanted corn on the cob. We are obviously fine now, it was just really shitty and draining.</lj-cut>

<b>Fourth of July:</b> Slept in, and then went to Lindsey's. There was a beer pong tournament set up in the lake, she'd inflated the water trampoline and made jello shots laid out like the American flag. We pulled her deck chairs into the water and that's where I spent a majority of my day, not gonna lie lol. Tony brought his Go Pro, we had so much fun with that thing - we shot it out of a water balloon launcher, did flips off the dock holding it, I can't wait to see all the footage. My sister picked us up and took us to my dad's family function. I was butthurt because neither Rob nor Tracy were there and I was very excited to see them. Nobody else ""gets"" me and I would have rather stayed at Lindsey's this year, tbh, just because it was so big and fun. We didn't stay long, but they did have AMAZING FOOD I WANT IT ALL I WANT MORE OF IT EVERY DAY I CANNOT. I called Lindsey and she came and picked us up on the jet ski!! She lives right across the lake from my uncle! It was hilarious - ""Okay, bye! *runs to end of dock instead of driveway, lol*"" We stayed there for fireworks, got eaten alive but it was a great time.

I slept in the next day and then went to <b>~dance practice~</b>: Tony had asked me a few weeks ago if I'd be interested in dancing for a piece he wanted to shoot for festivals. I said yes, because I have a confidence problem, when in retrospect I probably should have thought about the fact that I haven't danced, <i>really</i> danced, since 2006. Communication was really slow - we only definitively landed on a song about a week beforehand. He had asked his sister, Annie, and his friend's sister, Natalie (who I knew already - she was dancing for Deanna the same time she was my coach! Small world!), to be the other dancers so we met up to kind of do some choreography. Then I started legitimately freaking the fuck out. I have never liked choreography, you guys, it just does not come to me like it does other people. I will come by this honestly - I know my strengths, okay, and this is not one of them. Also, Natalie is a fucking PERFECT dancer, it is effortless for her because she still dances in college. So Annie and I were just like.... fuck. And felt like general pieces of shit. We went to the location to check out what we'd have to work with, and then got appetizers at a local bar. It was a good time and I love the people, I just had a panic attack.

I then had to run downtown for a <b>production meeting</b> for our webseries; I had had a lunch a couple of weeks ago (that I never wrote about, because I suck) to go over a Kickstarter script Marc had written. Broken record time - I. love. this project. And I love these people. I cannot even express how much I enjoy and treasure these lunches. Marc had said he might have to shelf this for 6 months to make room for a bigger, paying project. He added, <i>""I still really want to do this... not only because I still love the idea but because this project more than any other involves working with people who I genuinely like, and I think that's a precious commodity.""</i> and that means the world, because everyone involved feels that way. He emailed a couple of days later saying ""Fuck it!"", the other project wasn't moving quickly enough and that he wanted to give this a go. So we had that great lunch, and then pulled our lead in to read with us. We went to his office after hours, he showed up with a six pack and scripts for all, we just sat for two hours brainstorming and laughing to the point of tears. I am so excited for this!

I had to rush back home to <b>dance in that short film</b>. I still had to get all my shit together - I danced for years, my parents owned a fucking dance store and I still couldn't find a leotard anywhere in the goddamn house/garage. And then I had a breakdown. I just cried. I was so scared. I still had no choreography, I had fuck all to wear, I didn't have time for a nap like I thought I would, the entire crew are friends of mine and I didn't want to look ridiculous, I am so out of shape, I have put on probably 20 pounds since I last danced and beyond the fact that I'm insecure about it, it's a balance adjustment I'd never had to deal with before, I just freaked the hell out. I almost backed out. But I went. It turned out okay - Natalie and Annie were very helpful with choreography, and it was a much smaller scale project than I'd imagined (I didn't know why I thought the city would be bustling at 2 in the morning...).

He got a permit to shoot overnight in the cutest lake town, and built a homemade camera crane out of weights and a 2x4. The idea was that each one of us would have a different story and place in the city. My piece was on a dock, which was scary enough, okay. <lj-cut text=""+++ almost died, ended up nailing it even if I&#39;m not as perfect as I once was +++""> He had asked me earlier if I'd fall into the water, lmao, I never said no even though I was opposed to the idea from the get-go so I'm glad it wasn't brought up again and that the location didn't really facilitate it. He had all the best intentions but it was a little frustrating working with him because he knows nothing about dance or how difficult it actually is. He didn't really understand the concept of practice or muscle memory or how much time it takes to choreograph, memorize, and clean a routine, that we practice 2+ hours a day for months before competing one number. LOL he told us at practice that he wanted to do each of us in one constant take and we all just lol'd. When we got to the shoot and I was starting to dance, I was like, ""You've given up on the idea of doing this all perfectly in one take, right?"" He said he had, lol, and had found an additional set-up for everybody. 

But you guys!! About three takes in, he came up to me and whispered, ""I want to do you all in one take. I know I can get you in one take."" And at that point I said, ""Okay."" because I did originally want that, I just thought it was impossible. But at this point, I knew I'd get there. Obviously I wouldn't look as flawless as I'd have liked to, but it felt really good and seeing it on playback helped A. TON. The grayscale, moonlight, camera movement and wind were very forgiving. We got a pretty-close-to-perfect take about five in. Tony said he was happy, there were a couple of little stumbles that no one else noticed or cared about, so I let go and wrote it off as me just being an unreasonable perfectionist. PLUS, IT IS FUCKING HARD DANCING ON A DOCK. At one point, I jumped up onto a bench, and my shoe buckle got caught between two boards, I almost fucking died. There's a point were I sit on a rope like a swing, almost died. Even just walking, shit's uneven, I almost died. Seriously. It got to a point where I realized the only way this would truly look how I wanted it to look would be if I went to that same spot and practiced every day for two weeks. So I let it go - big girl! That's something I've been working on lately - I love my perfectionism because it's what makes me good at things, but I'm trying to learn when it's reasonable and when I truly do expect too much. He announced a wrap on me, and just as he detached his monitor I asked for one more take, thinking I could fix the two tiny stumbles that pissed me off. No such luck - it was truly awful, lol. ""You're getting tired,"" he said, he was right and we blew it off lol. It's all good though.

I had asked him to shoot me first so I could leave, but I ended up staying for the other two girls as well. It was such a fun concept and idea, and I wanted to truly have <i>fun</i> without worrying about anything after I had previously dealt with all that stress. Each of us had our challenges - Natalie, while totally flawless, had to do it a million times so the rest of us could get our timing right. We had the camera on the crane on a moving truck bed, so getting her as she danced down a sidewalk with various speeds and stops was difficult. Annie had to dance in the middle of the street, meaning she didn't really have anything to play off of like Natalie and I did. Also we had to cut short on her because she had an asthma attack. I can't wait to see it though, I am very glad I went.</lj-cut>

I had wanted to leave early because we were shooting from 2-5am and I had <b>a wedding the next day</b>. I was sore as FUCK from dancing, you guys, and then I had to run around for 6 hours, up down up down, in the brutal heat wearing all black. It is amazing what adrenaline can do, though. Wedding stuff needs its own entry because I've started talking and working a lot with a local wedding photographer and there's lots to say. She is very sweet, but it's all very new, I feel very limited by my gear and can't afford what she needs me to have. She's understanding, though - she remembers what it was like for her in the beginning and has said she's willing to invest in me, which always means so much. Doing another wedding this weekend! I also met with her today to discuss design work, color correction, and videography. There's just so much I can do for her and so much she needs, so I'm very excited. Will write more later! But shit, point is - it was a very busy, high-stress week. I didn't leave bed at all yesterday, pretty much, not only because I was tired but also because I COULDN'T FUCKING WALK."

"event","I decided I need to let go of the whole ""blog in order"" thing, because it only takes me longer and I end up forever losing some stuff in the process. So, catch-up: personal edition -

&rarr; <b>Gemma/<lj user=""iwant_sprinkles""> came and went</b>, that's how long it's been, but I already have an epic ""we met penguins"" entry that's pretty much almost finished, and then another that's a general summary/bullet list of things we did. We obviously didn't blog nearly as much as we used to (read: at all) when we were together and we don't even know why and mainly we were busy, and when we weren't busy, we were practically inhaling Breaking Bad. Anyway, moar talks later, I just wanted to sadly acknowledge this fact. :(

&rarr; We had my friend Sarah's <b>bachelorette party</b> last Saturday - we rented a big pontoon boat, and although the weather was crap we managed to have a good time. <lj-cut text=""+++"">I was drunk by like noon. The water was too cold to be in, lol, but we went in anyway. A local radio station was out cruising the water, they came up to us and threw a shit ton of Mike & Ike's on our boat. Sarah had a bouquet of lollipops and kept asking people if they wanted to ~suck for a buck~. I didn't bring my camera, obviously, because I am not stupid, so sadly I have no photos to show for this event, but it was fun. 

The second I took my dress off, half-drunk!Katie freaked and asked when my boobs got so perky, and promptly took a close-up photo of my cleavage. I was strangely unfazed. She also wouldn't stop telling me that I look like Chloe from Dance Moms, and that her belly button ring was fucking with her chakra. There was a ""bathroom"" (quotes because it was basically like an adult potty chair) on the boat that was an epic pain in the ass, didn't work, and was just generally hilarious - there was a curtain thing that three people had to hold up while Erin went in there, it was a huge struggle and I don't know how to describe it but we were laughing so hard we were crying.  It does amaze me how well my old dance team still gels. I don't consider us close friends anymore and half the time I feel like we've all changed too much but then we get together and it's pretty much the same. I really value that. </lj-cut>

&rarr; <b>We painted the apartment</b>! We had both our moms and also my grandma over, we got a bunch of food and just blazed through everything - we now have a red kitchen, a beige and navy living room, a cream bathroom, and a purple bedroom (which we already had but still). I will take and post pictures when a.) the place looks decent, and b.) our furniture gets here (see next bullet). It was traumatic because I don't like Jason's mom - she's never been mean to me, she's just a bitch to Jason and a general pill to everyone else. Like my mom got there and met her and was like, ""Your son is an amazing man"" or something and his mom was like, ""Are you sure we're talking about the same guy? LOL!"" like making a joke but it wasn't fucking funny and I could tell it hurt his feelings. And then he had to leave to pick up more paint, leaving me alone with her and the first thing she says is like, ""If he dares to make fun of me, I'm going home!"" Um, go then? You only ever stress me the fuck out. She went to paint the bathroom and I wanted to cry thinking of how excited I'd be if Derek's mom and I were painting together. I know it's not fair to keep holding onto that, but it's not fair that Jason's mom is such a bitch, either.

&rarr; We also <b>picked out a couch set</b>~ It feels so lame and adult to be excited about furniture. Does it count if I'm mainly just excited for the pillows?! Oh my god, it does. Anyway - I'm really impressed because a couple of weeks ago, it came time for Jason to renew his lease. Ideally we'd move to a studio apartment, but we couldn't find one and ran out of time. It's not like I hate it here - I love the area and I love being this high up, but I just fucking hate carpet and white walls. So I told him we could stay if we painted and got some furniture. Impressed because I didn't have to tell him twice or ask about it again - he took initiative on both counts and because of that, I find it easier to spend more and more of my time here. I'm in an awkward in-between phase, I think - I don't quite live here but I don't quite live at home. I spend a majority of my time here, but can't quite make the commitment of bringing all my shit here. I don't know. But anyway - we picked out <i>bitchin</i> furniture from LoveSac, <a href=""http://www.lovesac.com/sactionals/allaboutsactionals.html"">check this shit out</a>. We bought a ton of pieces so we can make whatever furniture arrangement we want on any given day. Just us? Fuck yeah, movie loungers! Having friends over? Sofa and love seat! Sofa, recliner, ottoman in the middle with a table top attachment! So ~modern. AND THEN WE GOT TO PICK OUT ALL THE FABRIC, BECAUSE IT'S ALL COVERS AND IT'S ALL CUSTOM.  

&rarr; Tiny adorable thing: the other day, Jason got a package. He opened it in the kitchen and yelled, ""YES!! My marbles came!!"" He just fucking ordered a bunch of marbles for some game he wants to make. I died. Sometimes I call him my mad scientist, especially when his hair is floofed.

&rarr; He mentioned he was going to Barnes & Noble on his way home from work to get the new Game of Thrones book, so on a whim I asked him to pick out a book he thought I'd like. ""Fiction or non-fiction?"" I said I didn't care, he's pretty good at picking out stuff I like. He came home with <b>the Steve Jobs biography</b>. I just... kaljhfa. There will be a post when I finish it. I had to make a work-related phone call later that night that I was really freaked out about so he got me a glass of wine, set the book in front of me and said, ""...inspiration."" I cannot. Because it is, and it is EXACTLY the shit I need to be hearing right now. I'm only like four chapters in at this point but it makes me feel like I used to feel all the time - young and limitless.

&rarr; I AM SO SORE, I CANNOT EXPRESS (HOW OUT OF SHAPE I AM, APPARENTLY). I shot a beautiful, beautiful wedding yesterday. The venues were beautiful, the bride was beautiful, all their fonts and details were beautiful, her fucking Vera Wang dress was beautiful. I have a shit ton to say on the subject but if I tell the whole story now, this will be tl;dr. It's been an ordeal, full of dread and crying and fear, but it turned out to be a great, new day and this could be the start of something.

&rarr; I went to my mom's for dinner tonight, and stopped at my grandma's on the way back. I didn't tell her I was coming by and she was so sweet and excited. She pulled out her iPad and <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/bugsyjean"">tweeted about it</a>.  It just hit me and I needed to write about it because these are the small moments I'm going to miss when she's gone. I could cry now just writing this. And she was asking me about #'s and verified accounts and everything, it was precious. Then she was telling me about how Draw Something set her up with a random game with a woman named Robbi, and that she's the only one who still plays with her. They play all the time and she's so good and seems nice, so I told her she should look her up on Facebook. And then she just FREAKED at how we found her, and could see photos of her family and everything. It was so cute watching her connect the dots (""oh! and that's her grandson, then!"") and just marvel at technology I use and take for granted on a daily basis. ""I want to be her friend..."" she said. I told her to message her but she was too scared and didn't want to feel like a creep, she kept talking about how she was ""creepin' on her life"", lmao. &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;"

"event","&rarr; We went to Greg's house for a Memorial Day barbecue. I got drunk on some raspberry shit and then Jason and I decided we wanted to take the golf cart for a ride. So we just drove off god knows where and got it stuck in the mud because he is a goddamn idiot. I was plastered and I knew it was a shit idea and we'd never make it across. So he had to push us out, lol, mud was splattering everywhere and he had to take his shirt off. He was really smart about it, using physics and shit I can't remember. I kept talking in a British accent and he was like, ""YOU'RE SO DRUNK, YOU WON'T STOP TALKING IN A BRITISH ACCENT"" and I was like, ""It's just an attempt to disassociate myself from this awful situation!"" in said accent. We got out, lols were had, etc. Then I made him take me to McDonald's because I don't like ~ribs~.

&rarr; We also went and looked at a gorgeous apartment - they transformed an old factory into apartments and a lot of artists live there, they rent shops on the first floor to sell their work, and the hallways have lime green stripes. The apartment had exposed brick walls, and with different colored brick too because apparently that room was where they kept the generator and every time they needed it, they had to break through and then rebuild. It was so cool. And the master bedroom had huge windows, and there is a 700 square foot patio that belongs TO THE APARTMENT, not all the building's tenants. I want it so much but a.) it's in a bad area, and b.) the couple who is renting it out ""might move back into it in a year"" and I'd hate to get all my shit in there, get attached, and then be kicked out. It's kind of awful. So ultimately we decided to just stay here for another year but I made him promise that we'd actually paint the place and get fucking furniture. I say ""we"" and everything, but I don't fully live there. I spend a shit ton of time there, yes, but all of my things are still at my place, even though he's asked me like three times to move in and I just keep telling him I'm not ready. I am a commitment-phobe and I have a legit panic attack every time I think of not having my own place to run away to. We got in a huge fight about it a couple of weeks ago (I told him I'm more likely to want to be there if it feels like a fucking home - read: has furniture, and he told me he's not going to buy furniture just to get me to move in with him, he didn't want me to move in for the furniture, he wanted me to move in for him, which I still think is bullshit - he got unnecessarily offended and over-thought it, if you ask me - I don't love YOU less because you don't have furniture, I love your APARTMENT less because you don't have furniture. And a small - nay, actually HUGE - part of me fucking HATES that I am fighting about FURNITURE. It's so adult and so fucking rudimentary at the same time, jesus.) I just don't know if I'm cut out for that shit, even though I love him.

&rarr; Went and saw <b>Snow White & The Huntsman</B> yesterday. Um, I loved it? Even though K-Stew was in it? IT WAS SUCH A FUCKING AESTHETICALLY PERFECT FILM. SO SO ABSOLUTELY SO FUCKING BEAUTIFUL, YOU GUYS. The colors and the lens flair and the black glass, the costumes, the metal, pure white horses, black birds GOD GOD.

&rarr; We went to Barnes & Noble after that and brb, copying from a comment I left to <lj user=""cabaretlights"">, when talking about feeling like we're in movies:
<blockquote>My life literally freezes for moments like this, and they don't even have to be big - like today, Jason and I were at Barnes and Noble, we had drinks and were just reading, and he got up to get a new book. So he stands up and I just sort of stare at him, before he walks over and kisses me. It's not a huge kiss or a make out session, it's just really slow and there were sparkles behind my closed eyes, you know? I smiled at him as he walked away and then when I turned forward to grab my drink again, there was an old man sitting in a big green chair across from me who had seen the whole thing, and he was happy. We both smiled and I went back to my magazine but it was one of those fucking moments, you know? Like I am literally tearing up right now just writing about it and I don't even know why, I can't even. But it felt like a fucking movie. It was a big deal even though it was small.</blockquote>
I was reading a wedding magazine because the woman I may work for (fingers crossed) gets her photos in it all the time and I wanted to look at wedding photography in general. Flipping through, I land on a page with a great shot - it's not part of the feature, it's just an ad, and I don't want to say my heart stopped because it didn't and that would imply something bigger than it was, but it was this weird half-shot of adrenaline. The photo is a medium shot of couple hugging on an empty dance floor with a DJ in the background, who turns out to be my ex, Randy. I think of the time after we broke up when he was flipping through some hipster newspaper and landed on me, what that felt like. Probably worse because I was in hot pink underwear and black lace, but still the same sentiment. We had a conversation when I was in LA, it was really honest and really sad - he told me that when it comes to the friendship aspect of a relationship, mine was always his favorite, I told him I felt really bad when he says stuff like that, he told me not to feel bad, and said he always felt comfortable around my family, I don't even know, etc.

&rarr; Speaking of exes, Jason and I went to dinner last night, a fancy Greek place we'd never been to. It was great, and on the way out I saw some of Derek's mom's art on the wall. <i>There</i> my heart stopped. I pointed, ""Oh my god!"" Jason was like, ""What?"" I didn't even know what to say? So I was just like, ""...I just know that artist."" I miss her so much, still, I could cry if I thought about it enough but I never let myself. I just wish we never would have fucking dated because now I just feel so weird about it and I feel like I can't just talk to her or ever try to go over there and make art without people making it unnecessarily complicated or her being closed off to the idea to protect her son or some shit, or maybe <i>I'm</i> just making it unnecessarily complicated and not giving her enough credit but it still feels weird and I love her so much you don't get it, I pick her over him in a million lifetimes, a million times over. And fuck, this, even this is too much thinking because tears are coming up and I need to be done.

&rarr; Happier things - GEMMA IS COMING. IN TWO DAYS. I HAVE TO CLEAN SO MUCH TODAY YOU GUYS LOLOL. NO BUT FUCKING A. In trying to plan things, I have to account for the fact that House is no longer a core element of our friendship because it's no longer a core element of our respective lives, lol, so we won't necessarily need three days when she first gets here to just lay in bed and make art and flail and shit. It's kind of sad but also kind of liberating? We can GO OUT and DO STUFF!! DO *ALL* THE THINGS! And oh my god you guys, the day after she gets here, Jason is picking us up at 10am and taking us to a surprise location because he made a photo scavenger hunt for us! WE ALSO DECIDED ON ANIMAL DAY, WHERE WE GO TO THE ZOO AND THEN THE AQUARIUM INSIDE THE MALL OF AMERICA AND NAME ALL THE ANIMALS AND RECREATE THEIR SOUNDS, AS WE ARE WONT TO DO. And I am taking her to the river where you rent huge tubes, tie them up in clusters, and float drunk down the river all day with your friends. I cannot even, I AM SO EXCITED. EVEN IF IT MEANS TODAY WILL BE HELL CLEANING ALL THE THINGS."

"event","<b>o1. Webseries -</B> The day after I got back, I had a production meeting with Jason, Marc, and our webseries actor, Reed. Who is <i>fucking</I> hilarious. We had lunch outside at a british pub downtown and just talked about the character, and it was absolute bliss, I love these people and we all work so well together. I've said it before, but it's perfect - one of us can say ""So, maybe there's A..."" and then the next can say, ""Yes, and then B..."" and the third can say, ""AND C."" and all of us instantly light up because we know that's it. And Reed - I had never really talked to him before, he is so funny, so kind, and absolutely our perfect guy (""Troy wouldn't call a punch a punch, what would he call it?"" ""A facial-fist collaboration.""). I was struck by how when I went to speak, everyone listened so attentively and with such respect. It upsets me that I consciously noticed that, it only means I've been treated like crap in production settings in the past (which I already knew, but). It's just so refreshing, I am so glad to be home working with them instead. We have a brilliant concept for our Kickstarter campaign. The plan is to run it through July and then hopefully shoot the pilot in August. It's hard to move forward because we all have to do other stuff that, you know, we actually get paid for, but we all hope that is temporary lol.

<b>o2. Theatre -</b> My little cousin Lexi is so fucking talented. She got the lead in her high school's production of How to Succeed in Business. Some of the seniors got all butthurt and mad at her because it's supposed to go to a senior I guess and Lex is only a sophomore lol. BUT SHE IS BRILLIANT, OKAY, and they asked me to shoot it -

<b>o3. Photography</b> - I had a shoot with a local musician and friend, Paul, for an album cover for his EP that's dropping this summer. He is very nice but it was difficult since he had no idea what he wants his cover to look like. You'd think I'd appreciate the artistic freedom that he's giving me but it actually makes it harder to have literally no idea lol. We'll see how it goes. I'm not worried, it's just difficult to start.

I had lunch with Tracy yesterday, and, um, I love her? Like yeah she's a photographer and yeah I may work with her but she completely gets me and I don't have to censor myself or worry about anything because we are so very alike. And it was fun to have a lunch where I could talk about photography as a whole, the processes and pet peeves, and be met with someone who is just as much of a perfectionist and just as bored of doing posed shoots. She's getting certified in a new photography program called Beloved, where the shoots aren't treated as shoots but as experiences. Like for example, if a couple wants a Beloved shoot, they come with mementos of their relationship, and having written paragraphs for each other about what their love means. They read them at the shoot and the photographer captures it. The photographer also is responsible for cracking them open - ""If you had to be separated for a year - imagine that - what would your last hug look like? *shoots it*"" or ""If you have a daughter in the future, what do you think she'll be when she grows up? *shoots the conversation*"" I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS. SERIOUSLY FUCKING EVERYTHING. So much better than ""Okay, sit on this couch, put your hand on his knee and tilt your chin! Smile!"" I mean, fuck. 

She had emailed me in the past about potentially collaborating on it - she really loves my Photoshop work, how I use textures and overlays, so she talked about her shooting and then me making digital collages for the couples/families. We didn't talk about that over lunch as much because she's not done with the course but asked if Jason and I would like to be her first couple. YES, YES, CRYING. So we're doing that on Thursday! I'm excited because it'll be fairly laid back, we'll all just figure it out as we go, and she mentioned how she wants to learn more about lighting so I told her to bring lights and Jason can teach us both at the same time. I asked her if people ever film these shoots, like if they ever have a videographer. Just because when I think of this shit, I think of stunning slider shots and lens flair and dialogue of their letters to each other set to fucking music with their hugs and crying and I want to explode. Like both as a photographer/video editor AND as a couple, I want that shit. We talked about that and transitioning to that in the future and I hope this takes off with her because it'd be such a great job and we'd create such beautiful things.

Also! The woman she shoots weddings with is looking for another assistant shooter and she gave me her info, told me to email her but I think I'm going to step it up and make her a video so she can see my personality and my work all at the same time. I need to get off my ass and actually do this. Like, today. She does beautiful work and just hearing about the fun (& expensive, & gorgeous) weddings they get to shoot makes me salivate. Like Tracy was telling me about some gorgeous Indian wedding they just shot, and how full of color and culture it was, how they did all these things she'd never even heard of that were so beautiful and my response was, ""... that is exactly why I love being a photographer - we get to see so many things that we'd never know otherwise."" I just left this woman feeling so inspired. I am so happy to be back home."

"event","As mentioned in a previous entry, I flew back home to surprise my sister. She was turning 21 (on May 10) and I had originally planned on being back for it, but in April the producer was like, ""You're staying through May, right? Good."" basically and I didn't really say no. On May 3, I booked a flight because the production company wasn't following through and IDGAF anymoar. My sister had NO idea I was coming home - she wrote on my Facebook that she was sad she was going to have another drunken night that I wouldn't be able to document. And then! MY PLANS WERE ALMOST FOILED - she texted me that Chris was taking her to some fucking country concert on her birthday, so I had to figure out how to get her to bail on the guy without telling her why. My mom was apparently like, ""Blow ~Chris~ off and come out with me instead!"" and my sister was apparently just like, ""Okay!"" lol SO FUCKING EASY.

I totally played along and even on her birthday, I was all, ""~I'm so sad I can't be there to celebrate!~"" about it and then I texted her when I landed to have a happy birthday, that I'd have to call her later because I was super late for a meeting lmao. My mom told me they were all at a restaurant and to come there, we stopped to get her a bottle of cake vodka and a tiara. When I walked in, I saw my family sitting at the bar, but luckily Angela's back was toward me. I started to run up and saw my mom and grandma frantically getting their cameras ready. Fearing that Ange would turn around like ""WTF"", I hid behind a plant lol. They told her to smile with our aunt and she was like, ""CAN WE SIMMER DOWN ON THE PICTURES, PLEASE"" all totally fucking pissy as I ran up behind and photo-bombed it. She still had no idea I was there, until I dangled the bottle of vodka and tiara in front of her face. Her reaction was priceless:

We came back to Jason's apartment to park our cars, we took some shots in the living room before we went to a dueling piano bar. Some trashy guy noticed my sister's tiara and miraculously it was his birthday too. And then he just... hung around? Like, my sister is incapable of telling guys off. And he was disgusting - TOTALLY fucking harshing our buzz. And his brother was a TOTAL dick, like he started picking a fight with Jason because he wasn't being ""nice"" enough (read: not laughing extensively at his shitty jokes and not going out of his way to give this guy high fives - literally. That was a literal fucking complaint). OH! And okay, how this bar works is you can request songs, you put them and a tip up on one of the pianos. This guy was so fucking entitled that he thought he could get the pianists to play for free for him, just because he was him, and had this whole fucking ""challenge accepted"" attitude about it all. He asked Jason how much you have to pay and he jokingly said $100, and his brother got legit pissed about it and kept dropping these comments (""Don't ask this guy anything - he won't tell you the truth"", not even joking in tone either). GOD they were fucking losers, I literally cannot. Finally they got the hint and left but not before having a hissy fit scene over it.

Anyway - we had a couple of martinis and also did some shots, one of which was a Blowjob. My sister failed tremendously and it was spectacular:

<center><lj-embed id=""323""/></center>
We requested a birthday song, so they called her up on stage. They made her climb up onto the piano while they sang a love song about doing it ~dog style~. Halfway through, one of the players got an idea to make her crawl across the pianos and say ""woof woof"" all sultry-like into the mic. And then he made her do it again. We fucking <i>died</i>. At at the end, everyone in the bar pointed at her and yelled ""you bitch, you slut, you whore ~happy birthday to youuu"" because that's what you do for birthdays there lmao. Then they give you a bumper sticker and you have to decide if you want it on your chest or your ass, she picked chest and the guy taped it to her boobs with his forehead lol. We had a great time. Moar drinks and songs, Jason and I made out in the photo booth like high schoolers.

We ran into one of my mom's friends from her old work; he suggested a bar but we passed another on the way that I insisted we go in. They gave her a birthday shot on the patio and I managed to convince her to dance up on the poled stage with me. Like I know it's seedy and it's a stupid fucking bar full of lame people, but I really feel like myself up there? I'm not saying I'm a stripper, I'm saying I just really miss performing and it's so easy. IDEK. There was some dude dancing with some girl and apparently he turned to Jason and said something about how ""sometimes you've just gotta give the ladies charity."" And then he was like, ""*points to me* I'm about to go give her some charity"" before Jason was like, ""LOL she's my girlfriend so I'm going to go give her the charity"" lolllll.

Angela started to feel like shit, surprise surprise, so I double-fisted our remaining drinks like a boss. Everyone went outside but Jason and I went to settle our tab. The bartender told us some chick had it, who was nowhere to be seen, and it was a really stupid system. So we started wandering in the hopes of finding her, and then there was the Donaho Situation, which is tl;dr and totally detracts from the birthday entry so I'll post that this afternoon. All in all, she had a really great time and I'm so glad I'm home!"

"event","I'm back home now. It was a fairly last-minute decision, I booked a flight just under a week in advance. I had planned on staying through the end of May but when, in the first week OF May, they still had no shooting schedule nor even a general IDEA of a shooting schedule, I decided that my sister's 21st birthday and meetings about projects that I actually get to work on were a little bit more important. Also, the cost of living is so high out there and it sucks not having a car. It sucks even more putting up with those things when you have no idea when you next get to do what you absolutely love.

I flew back on Thursday morning. Tuesday, Tony picked me up and we went to a hiking trail with our cameras. We shot black and white because we both have a huge boner for Herb Ritts right now. He had to do a conference call, so I just traipsed off by myself and I had <i>the most lovely time</i>. I started climbing high, but it all started to look the same and I didn't want to get too lost so I turned straight around. I found a different trail, it was more flat and also more wooded. I stepped into a clearing and just... the fucking trees and the way it was lit, it was a small wonderland. I came across a crown of flowers hanging on a tree, with orange and yellow ribbons in the back. I of course took it and put it on, it was such lovely Liss time. I came across a tiny lizard square in the middle of the path and he didn't run like the others. Probably because I talked to him nicely and constantly assured him I didn't want to hurt him. I just wanted to shoot him with my macro. And he totally let me. He was legit posing and only ran away when I stood back up and kept walking, I loved him!! &hearts;! I ended up one some road, I wasn't entirely sure I was in the same park anymore but whatever. I sat at a picnic table and called my mom, before Tony randomly drove up. IDEK how he found me or if he was even looking. 

We went to the promenade, I got chips and a lemonade and he got a burrito. We walked around and shopped a little before Tony decided he wanted to do some test footage at the beach. So we walked down to the ocean and just filmed me walking to the water and looking around because he wanted to practice some stuff in After Effects. It was fun, we took stills too and then just sat in the sand. It was a really nice pseudo-last day.

We went out on Wednesday, my last night in L.A. - six of us piled into one car and pretty much screamed Whitney Houston all the way there, with the windows down. It was the epitome of young adult. We got to the bar and I realized I had left my ID in my camera bag. Fuck. One of the guys we went with was nice enough to let me take his car back to my house to get it. Halfway there I realized that I had deliberately taken my keys out of my bag because I didn't want to lose them the night before I left. I almost started crying but then I decided that I would absolutely find a way to climb over our deck fence. It wouldn't be pretty, but I'd fucking get in. Turns out, none of my pride was spared as I found a hidden door in the fence. Been there for three months and wasn't even quite positive it was there. I walked right in, lol. 

Anyway, I got my ID, and my last night was spent at a ~classy~ little establishment called Stripper Circus. NO, IT WAS LEGITIMATELY THE MOST FUN I'VE HAD AT A BAR IN A VERY, VERY LONG TIME. POSSIBLY EVER. First off, it was a gay bar, so it was really fun to talk to and dance with people who wouldn't get the wrong idea and sleazily grope me. Also, they ttly appreciated my outfit - black heels, fuchsia capris and a matching top with metallic disks covering the entire front, they loved my top. BUT THAT'S NOT EVEN IT - it was like a bar carnival! They had huge circus posters featuring drag queens and circus-y names, naked men dancing on the bar, and games, fucking games! <lj-cut text=""+++"">Like one was called Cock-O-Toss, and it was a wooden board with tons of mounted dildos and you had to throw rings at them. If you got 2 of your 3 throws on a dildo, you got a winner's ticket. And another called Tip-A-Tranny, with a bunch of demented/trashy Barbie dolls nailed to boards on hinges and you threw bean bags to knock them over. If you got 4/7 knocked over, you got a winner's ticket. THEN, you take winner's tickets up to the front, where they had a huge wheel you could spin AND a fucking Plinko board! Prizes were drinks, shots, and lube! IT WAS SO MUCH FUN, I CANNOT. Then there was another game where there was poster of a naked man and you had to flip quarters to land on his dick. If you got it on the head, you got a drink, and if you got it on the shaft, you got a shot. I got absolutely wasted for $10, it was such a top night. Never even mind all the ripped strippers.

It was me, Lindsey, Brit, Gese, and Russell, plus two other guys that I guess Lindsey knew - we ran into them there. Everyone was really nice. We were all outside sharing a massive cigarette when I heard ""15 minutes until Strip Down, 15 minutes until Strip Down!"" I hit my head on a tree and we decided we needed to go in for ~Strip Down~. I didn't see anything, blah, but my favorite is when we saw flashes going off and the drag queen DJ was like, ""NO PHOTOGRAPHY DURING STRIP DOWN, NO PHOTOGRAPHY DURING STRIP DOWN."" God I wish we had that place here! And then we danced hardcore for fucking AGES, I was dancing with Russell, I almost fell but he caught me even though I was behind him. And then whenever I'd lose my balance even a little bit, he'd grab me, it was super nice. We all had so much fucking fun, I cannot even state, we just danced like hell.</lj-cut>

I felt like shit the next morning, not because I was especially hungover (I mean, a little, let's be real) but because EVERYTHING HURT, UGH I AM SO OUT OF SHAPE. My calves especially, dancing in heels, fuck. Also I only got like three hours of sleep - I was out like a brick FOR those three hours so getting up was complete shit. Everything I had wouldn't fit in my suitcase so Lindsey gave me a huge cardboard box she had been using to keep her shoes in. I got to the airport an hour before my flight left, which... probably isn't ideal but I've done it before and been totally fine, you know? <lj-cut text=""NO. SUN COUNTRY HIRES COMPLETE FUCKING IDIOTS WHO TAKE FOREVER. Also, general airport layout is traumatic in itself, I totally cry in public and hear my name being called on the intercom as I&#39;m still in security line."">NO. SUN COUNTRY HIRES COMPLETE FUCKING IDIOTS WHO TAKE FOREVER. THESE TWO STUPID BITCHES, THE LINE WAS LONG AS SHIT AND THEY WERE MAKING EVERYONE SHOVE THEIR CARRY-ONS INTO THAT STUPID SIZING BOX. So anyway, I finally get up there, she takes my ID and I ask for tape for this huge fucking box. She sends me down to the other end of the counter telling me there's more room there and she'll run my ticket down. Fine. Except I look over and see her checking someone else in? Are you fucking kidding me?! She finally brings my ticket over and I drop my luggage off. I still have my huge backpack and camera bag, but I feel loads better. I walk all the way down to the other end of check-in (no, seriously, Sun Country is the literal last station on the left and security is the last one on the right. So I get there, wait in line, only to realize that what I THOUGHT were my credit card AND ID, was just my credit card. STUPID BITCH NEVER GAVE ME MY ID BACK AND I WAS TOO STRESSED OUT WITH MY 50 PIECES OF LUGGAGE TO NOTICE. I ask the woman checking if she has any means to call down there and she's like, ""It looks like ~you'll have to go get it~"" in this fucking.... idek, judgmental tone or something. So I'm freaking out because it's 9:30 and I have to run all the way back across the airport, get through security, and get to my gate. Impossible.

I eventually got into the security line, which wasn't moving literally at all. The guy in front of me, a sweet older man, asked if I was in a hurry. I lol'd and said yes. He let me go ahead of him and then was super helpful, constantly telling airport workers I was in a hurry and asking if they could somehow rush me through. Seriously, it helped me so much just having him there. I heard them calling my name over the fucking intercom and I was still waiting for my shit to come out on the other side. I made my flight by some miracle, but then I was pissed because as THE SAME BITCH WHO FORGOT MY ID was ushering me and one other late guy in, she made a comment about how they wanted to leave a few minutes early! OMG fuck you! Then I was still so pissed off and stressed out that I didn't even come close to relaxing for an hour. Not a good flight. It did go pretty fast, though. The woman next to me was really nice, she's a hairdresser and she's going to New York and Israel! To do hair!</lj-cut>

Jason picked me up and when we got to the car, there was a purple present in my seat tied with green ribbon. I already died because I wasn't expecting a present, I was just coming home, it wasn't even a thing. DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS. HE GOT ME MOAR RAM FOR MY COMPUTER, I ALMOST CRIED. TELL ME IT IS NOT THE CUTEST. No boyfriend I've ever had before would have even entertained or thought of the idea, I love dating a tech-savvy person, he knows all the things. He even put it in for me when we got home and my computer is so fast now. ""But but! Coming home IS my present!"" I said. ""No, you coming home is my present. &hearts;""

We didn't have much time to lounge around before we went as surprise guests to my sister's birthday dinner, which definitely needs its own entry! As does the rest of the week lol."

"event","Thursday, we went to a barcade - meaning super dive bar (so dive it didn't even have a sign out front) full of old school arcade games. It was fun but the novelty (no pun) wore off pretty quickly. We went to the Sprinkles 24 hour cupcake ATM, waited in line for a bit but ultimately had to bail because we had to pee and also the line was v long. :( :( We had met up at Brit's house beforehand and I died because she game out in this mini skirt and we were all ~oh la la~ about it and she was like, ""this is my ~SLUTEVER~ skirt"". lol I had never heard that expression before, I died, I died. 

Friday we went down into Venice to get dinner at the food trucks - I decided I really really love Venice and when I come back to live for real, it will probably be there.

Cinco de Mayo was a blast - one of Lindsey's local uni friends had a party, there were like 12 of us who went to a park. We played drunk kickball, meaning the offensive team always had to have their beer in their hands, kick the ball and run with it and try not to spill. WELL, I had a pretty spectacular moment where I was running into first base, slipped on something and fell flat on my ass. Then on my back. Then on my head. It was a three-point fall. I didn't spill! Until I stood up lol. It was all good, I got so many high fives and was commended on the fact that I managed to salvage the liquor through all that turmoil. My ass just hurts, that's all.

<small>(pardon the shitty iPhone photo. But damn am I ever glad I didn't bring my real camera lol)</small></center>
There was a girl there who had cut a pinata in half and taped it to her body like she was riding a pinata horse. I died. She too played kickball, and kept the costume on. There was a brilliant moment where she was in the field and the ball was kicked, airborne, right to her, but she couldn't catch it and we all just watched it hit the horse in the face lol. We also played bocce ball! We walked back to Connor's apartment and then margaritas and patron shots happened, and I got so drunk that I RESPONDED TO MY OWN TEXT thinking it was from someone else. I was having a text conversation about Cinco de Mayo, and I asked ""You drunk yet?"" I checked my phone like an hour later, saw it, thought the green bubble was actually directed TOWARD me, so I replied ""Lol yes."" I can't, I can't. I ended up on the floor at some point, I still have not figured out why. We played an awesome game of musical flip cup - like musical chairs except you had to dance around the table and when the music stopped, you had to grab the beer cup nearest you, down it, and then flip it until it landed on its lip. Last person to successfully flip was out. There was beer everywhere lmao.

And then, AND THEN! We gave a couple a ride home and we were all SCREAMING Celine Dion in the car, it was <i>the</i> most liberating thing. Then Lindsey and I came home, got high, and fell asleep on the futon to Celine Dion's A New Day concert. It was a banner fucking evening. I felt like absolute ass the next day.

Yesterday I took photos of kitties that need to be adopted! This girl, Kari, she's fostering three tiny kittens for the next week or so and then she's taking them on the ~adoption circuit~ and wanted photos for their website. I get to see so many adorable/amazing things just by being a photographer, I love it so much. OH MY GOD SO CUTE SO CUTE I ALMOST TOOK ONE HOME:

<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/lissiexanga/DSC_0252.jpg"" width=""550""></center>
I was laying on the floor with my macro lens on, and then one of the kitties walked right up to me and started CLIMBING UP MY HIP and was just walking all over the place! Scratching at my Mario shirt and swatting at my hair and walking down my leg, I CANNOT. I DON'T EVEN CARE FOR CATS, YOU GUYS. BUT OH MY GOD SO TINY. And one of them had a bunch of litter stuck in her paw! So we called her Shit Toe and Kari had to clip it all out, oh my god. And there was one who always likes to play by himself, she says he literally just entertains himself in his little corner. I WANTED THEM ALLLLLLLL."

"event","I had written out a huge post about this past week but it's so tl;dr so I'll just present some highlights:

<b>&rarr;</b> Went out in downtown Hollywood with my cousin Rob, I tried sushi like a big girl and didn't hate the salmon. I hated everything else, though. They brought us this cooked neck-area filet or some shit, ~on the house~, even though he told them I was his cousin and it wasn't a date after I chopstick!failed with this huge-ass roll and he had to hold it up for me. Anyway, I bring it up because there were tiny fish bones in it, which I DID NOT APPRECIATE. ""I am so fucking done with this shit it's not even funny,"" I said. Then I got drunk, good times. I was hungover all day the next day, literally throwing up until 3pm.<b>ALSO, relevant story:</b> Some guy in a smart car tried to wave himself in front of us on the way to the bar and I was like, ""WAIT I KNOW THAT GUY LET HIM IN."" I don't actually know him but it was absolutely James St. James and any bff of Lisa's gets to cut in front of me in traffic, okay. I GOTCHU. A tiny thank you for being so sweet to my bb.

<b>&rarr;</b> Lindsey and I had a great night that consisted of Boston Market, spiked lemonade, and Hey Arnold on Netflix. It was weird how much I realized that my childhood cartoons are actually places in my head still.

<b>&rarr;</b> Also, she totally saw me topless - I got up at like noon, and took a shower. I assumed she was at work so when I got out, I put underwear on (thank god) and casually walked into the kitchen to get something for my wet hair. On my way back to the bathroom, I saw her wallet on the table. I was like, ""lol that sucks~""... but then I saw her keys next to it. ""Oh man that sucks even more. Wait, she couldn't have left without her keys. WAIT... *look over*"" Totally still in her bed. She was still half asleep so it didn't quite register, I apologized for scarring her for life. She was like, ""No it didn't scar me, I was more like 'Oh. So that's how it is'."" LOL.

<b>&rarr;</b> Went to the Newport Beach Film Festival, as the movie we worked on back in 2010 was showing there. We had drinks before and after with the director, unit production manager, and producer that I hate. No, no, it was okay though. He wasn't actively mean to me, just a little standoffish and also I hold grudges, so. The rest of it was fun, and the restaurant was really cool - they had jellyfish light fixtures! Also it was so lovely hearing Sam talk about his kids, how he's ""so in love' and how he never thought anything could ever be like that. I can't even.

<b>&rarr;</b> Had a whole day of beach volleyball with Tony and his friends. First quality beach day since I've been here! Fucking finally! I only played two games of volleyball, I don't quite care for it as it hurts my tiny chicken arms. So I basically just laid in the sand and drank beer all day, such quality. Except now I'm sunburned. And it's not even consistent sunburn, it's like random fucking patches that make no sense. But oh my, the ocean. &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; 

<b>&rarr;</b> I've been having a lot of freak outs lately about what I want to do with my life, worrying about missing my prime, wanting to do something but not sure what to do or where to start. I've slept so much, it worries me how much I sleep and how tired I still am when I wake up. I'm starting to wonder if I have a thyroid problem. So yeah, that's basically been the past two days - I have nothing concrete to show for them and I hate it. Lindsey cried last night about how she's turning 25 and just isn't sure of where she's supposed to be, what she should be doing, what would make her fully happy. So when I went to bed at 4 in the morning, I wrote ""You are still young &hearts;"" on the mirror in eyeliner. When I woke up at noon, she'd kissed the mirror and drawn ""&hearts;!"" We are leaving it up until we move out, I decided, as it's something we both need to remember every day."

"event","...why are people creeping my Myspace? I got a note that someone posted a Lisa photo with credit to me so I went to look because, wtf, and it was the crop & photoshop of a picture that I only ever put on my Myspace in my ""who I want to meet"" section. And obviously they are just now looking, otherwise there would have been a ""Where is this photo of Lisa from?!"" post four years ago.

Seriously, who does that. <i>I</i> haven't even looked at my Myspace in four years. It is embarrassing.

<b>EDIT:</b> Now I just went through all my messages though. Literal lols. I was such a bitch. But also so was everyone else. ~Young and wild and free~. Then I came across a conversation between me and Lifelong Fling from 2005, talking about how we were going to go see Rent. We never saw Rent. But guess what we did do?  There were also photos in there from the first night I drank Jagermeister. Not at all pretty. Also I was so small. It's just kind of a mindfuck to go through all of that, I don't even know. I miss my high school friends, and my dance team. I miss all the juvenile drama too kind of."

"event","On Monday, I had to do an interview. The director of one of our shorts was making props and puppets and invited me over to his house to get some footage of the process. He buzzed me into his black gate out front, and I got <i>lost</i> in his front yard. <i>So</i> much stuff. Think of a car junkyard, but instead of spare parts, it's all art. Sculptures, wood, furniture, paint. Piles and piles, no rhyme or reason, it was another world. I wandered around for ages just to find his workspace, but never did. I finally heard him calling for me from across the way. He brought me inside and there were TONS of props, ""toys"", and their boxes, lined on shelves across the entire perimeter of the room. I noticed two X-Files boxes, and the actual Mulder/Scully busts in a glass case near the hallway. I wanted to be like, ""Oh, you like X-Files?!"" but I forced myself to be professional.

So I start shooting his workspace and asking him questions. He is such a nice guy, and a genuine pleasure to interview. No one's been especially mean in interviews but you can tell when you hit someone who doesn't really care for them. No - he was all about it. At one point, I was on my knees, and his puppies - Art and Print - started burrowing between my feet, I felt them getting pushed apart and it took everything not to laugh or fall over. I asked him what kids bring to the table that adults can't, and if working with them forces him to dig out his inner child. ""That's a really unfair question to ask me, because I don't feel as if I've ever grown up."" Which... I fucking love in its own right, okay, but it gets better - ""Like you can probably tell just by looking around this room, all this shit I collect. To be fair, it's all stuff I've made - like a living portfolio - but still..."" He went back to painting his puppet, and I connected the dots. And then it just definitely came out - ""I saw those X-Files busts over there, did you make those?! Because I was obsessed with that show.""

He laughed fondly as he said something like , ""Yeah, I made those in David and Gillian's trailers. They'd pose for me - well, Gillian would, she was always really cool with it but David was a struggle."" He slapped his knee with a bigger laugh and said, ""My favorite David story - one day I asked him if he could give me the quintessential ~Mulder expression~ and he goes, 'I will give you no expression'."" I said, ""... and that was exactly the expression you meant,"" at the same time he said, ""I pointed at him and was like, That's it!!"" We laughed at each other and how we both knew ~the face~, it made me so happy, you guys. I know I complain and get so fucking stressed out here sometimes but moments like that... higher than anything and I kind of can't believe my life. Like, this is literally my first paid project and I get to talk to these wonderful, involved people, where will I be when I've actually had experience? Who else will I get to talk to, what else will I crack open? It is so empowering and inspiring and I really need to hang onto experiences like this because it can be so brutal. I want to quit and go home at least 3x a week but then I get on set or meet someone like this and it's all so fucking worth it.

I had a couple of moments on his set where I was a total idiot/blonde(even though I'm not even) but he was still so incredibly nice. As I was leaving he asked how it all went, if I got good stuff. I said yes with a big-ass smile and he said, ""Great. I can't wait to see."" 

<lj-cut text=""+++"">He had asked a friend who does behind-the-scenes work to come as well - the same guy I had KIND of a bad experience with but who is super nice and we are much better now. When he heard I was going to be there, he was really excited and I love when he's there because he always grabs stills of me working and they are always so amazing. When he showed up, our producer didn't know he was going to be there, she got excited and said hi, blah blah. And then he started kind of teasing me, talking about how ~I clearly wasn't good enough~, I know he was just ribbing me and it was totally fine but Producer was like, ""No - Alyssa's doing a great job."" Which was fucking AWESOME to hear from her because she was the one who was all worried that I didn't have enough video experience at the beginning or whatever. And she's been nicer to me lately too - she was never mean but now she like, responds to my emails and actually does work I need her to do, I think it changed when I stopped caring and started backing off a bit. When I stopped acting like a needy, self-conscious, new person, she stopped treating me like one. And she's even started calling me ""Liss"" which is kind of adorable.

Anyway - I bring up that other guy because he was SO FUCKING NICE, he had to leave early but he let me keep his cameras to play with! He said he'd leave his D7000 and I was like, ""Okay, sweet,"" and then he said he'd leave his Canon 5D Mark II and his dolly slider and his mic and battery pack and shit. I was like, ""No, lol, don't."" He asked why and I was like, ""BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BREAK ANYTHING, THAT IS WAY TOO MUCH TO BREAK."" He laughed and told me I wasn't going to break it. I was like, ""No I actually might."" That's a lot of shit for my tiny self to keep track of, you guys, especially around that many people who are constantly moving. He was like, ""Okay how about you just try <i>not</i> to break it. If you do, whatever, just try not to - that's all I ask."" I smiled and said okay. P.S., I didn't break anything. 

We had to swing by his house after wrap to bring it all back, but he wasn't home when we got there. ""Just put it in the trash cans out front,"" he says. LOLS DKLJFHASLJKDHFAHJKL. No guys it actually drives me nuts how little he cares about his equipment lol. Like he'll constantly leave his cameras just SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING, LENS DOWN ON CONCRETE. I am constantly yelling at him to not leave his multi-thousand dollar livelihood laying around for people to step on. Like oh my god! Some guy came over and was like, ""We had to move one of the walls, we didn't know this was behind it, and we kinda knocked it, sorry."" lol seriously he just leaves his shit on the floor. And now he wants me to put it in his trash can. ""I'm not going to put your cameras in your fucking trash can, Lan,"" I said deadpan into the phone. ""Okay not the trash, I mean the recycling can."" I'm not doing that either! ""Okay just find a place somewhere,"" he says, ""Just shove it all somewhere, it'll be fine."" lol I put his memory cards in his mailbox and then NEATLY set his cameras and slider between his house and a wooden table that was leaning up against it. He got everything okay, it was a successful operation but damn. I can't wait until I get to the point where I don't have to give a fuck either. But what an awesome, trusting dude.

We shot on Tuesday, it was a 15 hour day and everything hurt but I didn't even care. And the kids! God, continue to melt my heart right the fuck off! Their tiny voices, and the way they kept referring to Director as ""Mr. [mouthful of a last name]"" IN those tiny voices. And he let them call ""Action!"" IT SLAYED ME. And the little actress, she was like 8 and she brought her little sister and she was telling me - ""Next time my sister comes back to do a movie, I'm going to be in it too."" I asked her if she wanted to be a famous actress someday. Her feet went a little pigeon-toed as they dangled from her chair, as she nodded yes. ""You go, girl,"" I told her as I gave her a high five. She lit up. I can't, I just can't.</lj-cut>"

"event","We shot another episode this weekend, I absolutely cannot wait to show you guys this one. The first one was fun and cute and all but this one is SO my style, so colorful but kind of creepy and can I just say again how much I love the premise of this show? Kids making up stories, directors having to produce them as is. Like I know I've been stressed and had issues but it's always so much fun actually being on a shoot and seeing it all happen. Also, something I've noticed this weekend is that I've gotten a lot more assertive, even just since my first shoot . Like before, when I saw someone do something awesome and I missed it, I just was mentally like, ""Damn it!"" and wrote it off, but now I'll ask people to do it again for me or even stage things on purpose. Today when our kids wrapped, they were just going to let them go but I asked the line producer to make a big deal of ""that's a wrap!"" and have everyone clap and it turned out great on my BTS film and it's just so much easier for me now that I've hit my boiling point - I was so worried before about doing a good job and making a good impression that it actually impeded my work and now that I don't care as much, I'm actually doing a better job. I don't know, but it feels much better. Honey badger don't give a shit. ALSO THESE KIDS WERE SO CUTE, I LOVE HAVING KIDS ON SET (I did a little interview with them and they went on and <i>on</i>, giving advice to aspiring actors, I cannot even, my true people)! AND WE HAD CONFETTI THIS TIME! IT GOT EVERYWHERE AND NOBODY EVEN CARED! I wear X-Files shirts and jeans to work and nobody even cares! I swear and sometimes take naps and nobody even cares! It is a great industry! Note to self: remember this next time you bitch about it. Also we got free yogurt to take home! Strawberry because I wanted it!

OMG you guys, I called my mom this morning when I was waiting to leave, we talked for a little bit, it was fine and normal but then I got a text saying she cried after we hung up because she missed me so much. Break my fucking heart, okay.

We finished at like noon so we wanted to go to the beach but it was too cold and hazy :( :( Also we ended up falling asleep lol. I got woken up by this stupid fucking couple in our apartment complex who was fighting with their windows open. The wife was pissed because the husband apparently told his mother that she makes $15/hour and she didn't want her to know. And his defense was that his mother thought she only made minimum wage so he thought he was making her look good, lol. So I listened for awhile just because I love drama and then when it died down, I tried to sleep again. Just as I was dozing off, they started again. Then stopped. I had decided that if they went up again, I was going to scream out <i>my</i> window, ""Dude (who's name is Neil, I heard), you need to stop being such a mama's boy, and chick you need to get a better job if you are that embarrassed. And you both need to shut your fucking window.""  But I didn't hear them again. IDEK how it ended but I nearly made popcorn, it was that srs.

Tonight we went out with Lindsey's friend Robin, we went bar-hopping in Redondo Beach and I love both bar-hopping and Redondo Beach (or somewhere near there, I'm not actually sure. We shot in Pasadena today and I love Pasadena I decided!! So adorable! We shot in a super cute shop, I wanted to BUY ALL THE THINGS). I freaked the fuck out because we got back to Robin's and I couldn't find my phone. We went back to the bar and nobody had seen it. There was a lovely gentleman at the bar, lol omg I must have looked so pissed or stressed out because I walked up, totally professional (or so I thought lol) and this patron was like, ""Here's a bottle of whiskey, go for it."" lol. I asked the bartender if anyone turned in my phone, he made a call and eventually said no. So this guy asked if he could GPS it for me and let me use his phone and everything, super nice. We were driving back (LOL also we totally passed Jay Leno, like legit - Robin was like, ""Do you know who's in that Jag? Jay Leno."" So Lindsey like got in the lane to get next to him and it was totally him. This is my first celebrity sighting here, you guys, it's kind of a big deal) and calling it and Robin just goes, totally nonchalant, ""It's right there."" lol it was under the seat. I felt myself blushing, I didn't even need to look in a mirror. But seriously I was freaking out so much, I was just waiting to get out of public so I could burst into tears and just die. IMAGINE HOW GOOD IT FELT WHEN I HAD IT IN MY HAND AGAIN. Seriously, all the good in the world."

"event","<lj user=""whenidream"" /> asked to interview me for a college project on artificial life and attachment to fiction and I happily obliged. Because yeah, let&#39;s not even pretend I don&#39;t have shit to say on the subject, lol. I&#39;d love it if you read this and offered your own thoughts/experiences! And I&#39;m probably biased but I feel like I&#39;ve got some quality insight lol.

<lj-cut text=""Q&amp;A under the cut!""><p></p><p class=""p1""><b>01.) What fandoms do you identify yourself with, past and/or present?</b></p><p class=""p1"">X-Files, House MD, American Idol (a lot more but they were tinier so I&#39;ll mostly talk about these three)</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>02.) Out of all these, in which one do you think you had the strongest experience with the fandom community itself? Why do you think it was a strong experience?</b></p><p class=""p1"">House MD, definitely. When I was involved with X-Files, I was much younger, which of course translates to me being a little more immature in my interactions with others, and also at that point I didn&#39;t have a handle on how to Photoshop or edit video and these were the things that strengthened my involvement in the House fandom. I came into XF at the end of its seventh season, and I came into House toward the end of its second. So I got to be with House in realtime a lot longer.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>03.) Has frequent interaction with a fandom community (ie: weekly post-episode chats) altered the level of intensity (either more or less) with which you experience a show or connect to its characters? How so?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I think about this all the time - X-Files still feels so much more personal and to an extent, real, than House does. I think when you get involved in a fandom community, it can be a GREAT, fun, energetic and passionate experience, but at the same time can constantly remind you that the show is just that - a show. At the end of the day, I am absolutely happy I&#39;ve gotten to experience both sides of that coin.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>04.) Do you feel connected to people in your fandoms who watch the same show, but are obsessed with a completely different character than you?</b></p><p class=""p1"">It depends on how they conduct themselves - as long as they&#39;re passionate about the show as a whole and don&#39;t make a point of knocking the character that I love, it can be a great experience as it expands the sense of camaraderie you get. However, if they&#39;re really close-minded and catty and seem to ONLY watch for their character or ship I hate, then we literally have nothing to say to each other lol.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>05.) How do you feel about people who discuss TV shows in reviews, on forums, etc, but aren&#39;t involved in fandom, or not emotionally engaged with those shows? How do you make sense of what they&#39;re doing?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I guess I see them as part of a group of people who waste some time? I don&#39;t know - I understand that everyone is entitled to an opinion but to talk about something you&#39;re not emotionally engaged with doesn&#39;t make much sense to me. I suppose this is assuming they&#39;re talking shit but the same can be said for people who give positive reviews. It is some people&#39;s job to review all sorts of shows they&#39;ll never have time to form a real connection with, too. So in that respect it makes a lot more sense.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>06.) Has a fandom ever changed the way you look at a show? How?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Yes - as mentioned in my answer to #3, fandom has the ability to constantly remind you it is &quot;just a show&quot;, that these characters are not real, independent, breathing human beings. Being involved in the creative side of fandom - graphic art, video editing - has definitely made me look at a show differently because I watch every episode with those glasses on - what story can I tell on top of theirs? How can I lyrically communicate the same stories?</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>07.) Are there any fandoms with people that drive you absolutely crazy? What do they do that drives you crazy?</b></p><p class=""p1"">THE LISA EDELSTEIN FANDOM DRIVES ME FUCKING NUTS. When I first started watching House, the number of people who loved Cuddy&#39;s actress beyond the show were very few. Really, I think of myself and about five other people. She obviously started getting more attention, especially when she became entangled with the lead character, and now she has fans all over the world which is extraordinary. However, there are a lot of overseas fans who are, let&#39;s just say... a little too passionate about her. I read a recount of a fan who met her in Italy - she posted the tale on her own blog as if she were proud of the fact that she chased her through a hotel and had to get hauled off by security. She was bragging about this, about how - regardless of the outcome - this was her dream and it came true. Fucking batshit. There was also a really weird ad taken out in the paper and rumors of IVF simply because Cuddy tried it.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>08.) What to you, is the right way to fangirl? What type of fangirling is going too far? Or what&#39;s not enough to qualify?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I don&#39;t know, I guess it depends on the person but to me fangirling is loving something so much that it can&#39;t be contained inside you, and it changes your life for the better. There&#39;s a difference between fangirling and just loving someone. I absolutely fangirl Paula Abdul - I have every remix of all of her songs, I&#39;ve watched all of her performances from the 80&#39;s to now, I feel a connection to her. There are people I loved and appreciate but don&#39;t consider myself a fangirl - I love Susan Sarandon and Laura Linney and Sela Ward, I think I could get to the fangirling point with them someday but I&#39;m not there yet. When you fangirl someone, you know.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>09.) How do you go about fangirling someone or something, ie: what &ldquo;activities&rdquo; make up your process?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Watching all of the work they&#39;ve done, reading/watching every interview you can possibly find, announcing to your blog/the world that you&#39;re so totally in love with so-and-so, and calling for others who are so totally in love with so-and-so to step up and tell you so you can &quot;flail&quot;. The come a series of MSN conversations or emails just full of gushing about said person. It always feels good to realize you&#39;re not alone, that something about this person or show is genuinely amazing and not just a personal bias. Then there comes the purchasing of all the relevant DVDs, and for me there&#39;s editing. Editing is such an important fandom activity for me because it allows me to truly communicate what I see and feel when I look at these shows. I&#39;ll talk about this more on a later question. :)</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>10.) Has your process of fangirling evolved over time?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Yes, oh my word - when I was into X-Files, I was way more vocal about it. I was just finishing up middle school, and I still cringe when I think about the time that me and my friend Sally had our math teacher read our fanfiction because ~he loved XF too~ and we thought he was hot. I would never in a million years do that now. The series ended the night before we were all to take a Grade 8 trip to Chicago. I was predictably a basketcase. I printed off all of the finale promo shots, laminated them, and brought them with to put up in our hotel. I think it helped that I had smart friends who liked the show too, but still.&nbsp;</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>11.) What was your first fangirl experience, and what was it like?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I don&#39;t remember a defined first experience, but I remember a general feeling - I started out on FOX&#39;s X-Files forum, I still remember exactly how it looked and felt. There were tons of creative people I looked up to, and through that found another board aptly called Creative, where people would post beautiful fanart from a bunch of different fandoms. I wanted to learn it so much. Videos, too - there was a video editor called Lyle and he was amazing, he made me want to learn to edit so badly.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>12.) When you watch someone in something and realize that you&#39;re going to be obsessed with them, does that trigger a certain emotion or sensation for you that is different from what you experience watching a show or character you don&#39;t fangirl? What does it feel like?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Yes - for everything I&#39;ve ever fangirled, I can trace it back to a specific moment which I&#39;ve often referred to as the &quot;catalyst&quot;. For Lisa Edelstein, it was a tour of the House set - she was so funny and audacious, so different from her character. For Paula Abdul, it was her Cold Hearted video - my god, the woman could dance! She was more than just the pretty judge! X-Files, I was channel surfing and my mother told me to stop, that I&#39;d really like this show. I kept flipping to spite her but after she left, I put it back. The episode was Home, the one that was banned from television when it first aired, but I loved it. As for explaining what this feels like, I&#39;m not sure I adequately can but it feels like a spark. A spark inside and a growing light behind my eyes. Maybe a tiny bit of adrenaline.&nbsp;</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>13.) Does that feeling go away after you&#39;ve fangirled someone for a while? And if so, do you move on to something else or do you keep fangirling that person? Why?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I think it does but it never completely goes away. I&#39;ve often given the metaphor of the Fandom Car - you&#39;re driving, and only one fandom can ride shotgun at a time. All of your other favorites are in the backseat though, able to be ushered to the front next time you stop for gas. Like I can recall three separate waves of Catherine Zeta-Jones obsession. I feel like I fangirl people and shows that I need most at any given time in my life.&nbsp;</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>14.) How close do you like to get to the subjects of your fandom? (ie: some of you might have met your favorite actor several times at conventions, while others prefer not to meet actors at all.) Does that change your perception of how real a show is, or how real a character feels to you?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I&#39;ve met Paula Abdul twice but that&#39;s about it - I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve met a fandom subject/character so I don&#39;t know how that would have changed me. But hypothetically, if I had met Hugh Laurie, I feel like it would have been an amazing experience - it may have changed how I viewed the show but I think at that point I had known that the characters were played by actors and weren&#39;t entirely real.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>15.) Since you&#39;ve started doing some stuff behind the scenes/on sets, have TV shows/characters started to feel less real to you since you know what goes on behind the camera?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Absolutely - it&#39;s gotten better but the first film I saw in a theater after I&#39;d done work on a movie set, I was so distracted by film-making elements, especially art department work (that was what I was doing at the time), that I cried out of fear I&#39;d never be able to truly enjoy a film ever again. These distractions still come up when I watch TV shows, but I&#39;m able to control them more and get over them more easily. Instead of freaking out that I can&#39;t focus on the show, I look at it as a way to appreciate the people involved like me who specifically chose that beautiful poster back there but will never get any attention or recognition for it. In addition to noticing someone&#39;s work, I try to look at those moments as learning opportunities - since working in production, every film and television show has become a learning opportunity as well as a piece of entertainment, so I think there&#39;s a special value in that.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>16.) Does vidding make you feel closer to your favorite characters?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Absolutely - vidding is such an important part of fandom for me, because it&#39;s like I get to spend time with these people. Editing a timeline of their story (or writing a new one) is akin to sitting down with a fictional character for coffee. That&#39;s honestly what it feels like. Sometimes it&#39;s light-hearted and funny, sometimes it turns into a really emotionally-charged conversation. I use the term &quot;conversation&quot; because for every video I&#39;ve made, I&#39;ve learned something or explored a corner of myself, as well.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>17.) Do you feel like vidding helps you to understand them in ways that you didn&#39;t understand them from the show itself?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Yes. I started providing commentary with my videos because I needed people to understand these people and these stories the way I came to understand them through the process of editing them. I&#39;ve had people tell me that they enjoy my edits and commentary more than the actual show sometimes. I don&#39;t say that to brag or act like I&#39;m some kind of authority on the subject, I say it to speak to the power of editing and the process of taken what you&#39;re given and exploring it so much deeper.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>18.) Is it worth it? Is there part of you that prefers fangirling privately and keeping the characters to yourself, or is it better to share it with others? Why/why not?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I think there are merits and challenges of both. Fangirling privately automatically increases the realness of the show and characters, and also frees you from being affected by others&#39; criticisms. There are some storylines and plot points that you are indifferent to or even like that, had you been involved in fandom, totally hated simply because everyone else was bitching about how weak they were. Fangirling publicly/sharing with others definitely increases passion. There are people who choose to remain spoiler-free but I look back on spoiler speculation as some of my favorite moments in life. Staying up all night, having charged conversation threads with tons of different people, so much possibility and passion. People are so fucking alive there which I think is the biggest benefit of sharing your fandom with others.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>19.) Do you have any memories of fangirling that you look back on now and find completely embarrassing?</b></p><p class=""p1"">The fanfic thing from #10. I also posted a video blog after House and Cuddy finally &quot;got together&quot; and I&#39;m totally crying and ridiculous. I leave it up because a lot of people felt the same way and seemed to appreciate how raw I was being about it, but now I look at it and can&#39;t believe I posted it. I must have feel really safe. I got an email from the prop master who had somehow seen it, I wanted to shrivel up and die but he really appreciated it, and appreciated being a part of something that made someone feel the way that I felt. He sent me a private set still as a thank you, so ultimately it was worth it and received well but still kind of embarrassing, especially given how the show ended up and how resentful I am of it now.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>20.) Do you have a self-defined &ldquo;low point&rdquo; in your life as a fangirl?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I&#39;m not sure if you mean feeling pathetic for loving something so much or just being depressed - if it&#39;s the former, I don&#39;t have a low-point, but if it&#39;s the latter I can&#39;t help but think of when it was announced that Lisa Edelstein would not be returning for the last season of House. I was at work and I checked my phone on a break to see that I had tons of texts and tweets about the news. I started crying without thought or consent and had to leave my desk. I had already had an awful day at work, temping for a super incompetent bitch who didn&#39;t know her right foot from her left yet somehow made more money than me, and the news completely broke me. I finished out the couple of hours I had left but couldn&#39;t focus at all. I literally stared at the screen and pretended to type when people walked by. I couldn&#39;t get out of there fast enough and she even tried to keep me late but I was firm. I full-on sobbed in my car, called my boyfriend in hysterics and asked him to please meet me for a drink somewhere. I cried in the middle of Don Pablos and didn&#39;t even care, I bet it looked so ridiculous but it was a completely earth-shattering day.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>21.) Have you ever found yourself fangirling someone too much, and then disliking them as a result of that?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Never! Although... I didn&#39;t actually fangirl Coldplay but I liked them so much at one point that they bug me now? Maybe it&#39;s different with music, lol.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>22.) Does the experience of watching a character once a week on TV engage you in different ways than if you just saw them occasionally in a movie or something? How does it affect your day-to-day life?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Absolutely - you become so much more invested. Think of your real life - are you more invested in lives of friends that you talk to every day/week, or the friends who only meet you for dinner every three years when they&#39;re in town?</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>23.) On the other hand, a movie or book is a polished, perfected work. Is there a certain satisfaction you get from watching a character that&#39;s been perfected, versus watching a week-to-week character who is vulnerable to the constantly changing forces of television?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I suppose, but that&#39;s assuming that the writers/film-makers did it right the first time. Or, let me rephrase, that you agree with their characterization. The terms &quot;polished&quot; and &quot;perfected&quot; are entirely subjective. With television, you can attach to a character that you&#39;re attracted to and follow their story for years, even if they aren&#39;t the protagonist. I think it frees you up from the writer&#39;s bias a little bit. You can of course attach to a secondary character in a film but it&#39;s often less rewarding because after two hours, it&#39;s over. You know nothing beyond that. It&#39;s a lot easier to choose and find someone you identify with in a television show and continue to learn about them. Say you do naturally attach to the protagonist as intended - in a film, if they end up doing something that you don&#39;t agree with or turn into a bastardization of the character you initially loved, that&#39;s it. In a series, you always hold out hope that they&#39;ll come to their senses, or revert back to the one you fell in love with. You get to see that play out and even though I guess it&#39;s the same with directors and show-runners in that they get the final say, I feel like with the former it&#39;s more &quot;my way or the highway&quot;. Also with television it&#39;s a lot more interactive. When David Shore set out to do House, he&#39;d intended for Cameron to be his love interest, which he started with. When it was realized that not only did Hugh Laurie and Lisa Edelstein have true natural chemistry, but that fans really wanted to see that play out, he shifted focus and was able to work with that pairing. In a film, that wouldn&#39;t have happened.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>24.) A lot of shows that last a long time swap out old characters for often uninteresting new characters. Why do you think the new characters have less appeal than the original ones?</b></p><p class=""p1"">My question is, why do the show runners think the new characters have more appeal than the old ones? I think they appeal to us less because, as I talked about earlier, we&#39;ve already made an investment. I understand that in X-Files it was a negotiation gone wrong that swapped out David Duchovny for Robert Patrick, but in House they brought in new fellows and still kept the old ones. I suppose it was an effort to stay true to the idea that a fellowship was only three years long, which makes sense, but I think that show runners just get bored and/or lazy. They want to play with the shiny new thing instead of working to keep continuity and consistency with a character they&#39;ve already created and delved into.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>25.) Have you had any experiences where you have felt less engaged with a character over time because a show has declined in quality? If so, what was it about the show or character that changed to make them seem so different? (Actions, personality, dialogue, etc)</b></p><p class=""p1"">UM, House? It had been declining for awhile but when he DROVE HIS CAR into his ex-girlfriend&#39;s dining room just because she had another guy over for dinner, that was so fucking it. It wasn&#39;t even believable and no matter how many times TPTB try to tell people that it was Housian and in-character, they are fucking wrong. What I loved about House in the beginning was the intelligence and the tackling of moral and ethical issues. These things also declined and got sloppy but I was able to overlook it because I was so compelled by the layers of House and Cuddy&#39;s relationship and history. When that declined and got lazy as well, there was nothing to keep me there. I need to revisit a previous question - when talking about the interactivity between TPTB and audience that is made possible through a television show, this can absolutely take a negative turn. I was SO turned off by Greg Yaitanes (House producer) and his nonchalance on Twitter about the entire thing. He never addressed anything with even a hint of understanding, only the petulance of a child. This in turn affected my enjoyment of the show as well. Going into it, he would tweet about House in relation to Cuddy to build buzz. He supported it and talked about it all the time. Then it went south, he addressed it with a simple &quot;KABOOM&quot; and then started talking shit about the relationship and those of us who supported it. It felt like a slap in the face, it was such a double bind situation - get us to get behind the pairing and then reprimand us for it. I felt like I was being punished for daring to love his artwork.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>26.) How do you deal with a character who just doesn&#39;t feel the same anymore? When you watch the bad episodes, are they still the same character? Or an alternate universe character? Or do you just separate it from canon in your head?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Yeah, I kind of ignore it and separate it. With House it&#39;s too new and I&#39;m still so pissed off that I hate the character even in reruns right now, but with X-Files I learned to treat seasons 8 and 9 as a separate show. When I compare it to The X-Files, yeah, it&#39;s bad, but when I look at it as a standalone show, it&#39;s not bad at all. That learned principle has translated in my real life as well - I&#39;m able to separate things more and it&#39;s really helpful because I get less caught up in &quot;WHYYYYY CAN&#39;T THIS BE LIKE IT USED TO&quot; and am able to appreciate things for what they are.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>27.) Sometimes, when things go wrong, members of a fandom are quite vocal about discussing exactly who is to blame, or what went wrong with the show. Have you ever been involved in discussions like this?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Yes of course - if we&#39;re going to talk about things when they&#39;re going right, we&#39;re definitely going to talk about things when they&#39;re going wrong. A great example is when Lisa Edelstein did not return to House and it was a contract problem. We still don&#39;t know exactly what happened or what was said, we don&#39;t know if she was fired or if she quit, so there&#39;s been a lot of speculation about what happened. Some blame the network for slashing the budget, some blame whoever may have asked her to take a pay-cut, some blame her for not &quot;staying loyal&quot; even if it meant being paid less than her male counterparts (and we&#39;re not talking about Hugh Laurie - it would be wrong for her to ask for the same salary as him - we&#39;re talking about Robert Sean Leonard, who is the final point in the OT3 core who holds Greg House together). There has been a lot of vocal discussion on these issues, and what pisses me off about them is seeing her own fans saying she should have stayed in a situation she was potentially uncomfortable with just for their benefit.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>28.) If so, have these discussions made you feel any better about the way the show has changed?</b></p><p class=""p1"">No. lol.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>29.) Have you ever tried, as a viewer, to reverse these changes by your own means? Do you think it&#39;s worth it?&#39;</b></p><p class=""p1"">Yes and absolutely. Another huge reason I edit fanvideos is to explore potential that I think the show wasted. I don&#39;t consider myself a fanfic writer but it&#39;s the same thing for them - it&#39;s a way to make sense of the show and to tell stories that we believe are worth telling, to explore lost or missed opportunity.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>30.) How do you deal with situations where the real world is at fault for a show changing (ie: one of the actors quits to have children)? Does it mess up the image of a fictional world to have something perfect in canon be disrupted by a real life event? Is it harder to take the show seriously after that?</b></p><p class=""p1"">It&#39;s really difficult - it does completely disrupt the fictional world. This is one of the things I include when I mention that it could be easier to not be involved in fandom. If you don&#39;t follow the actors and producers&#39; comments, if you don&#39;t seek out or follow anything not presented on the screen in front of you in its designated time slot, you can assume that Mulder really DID get abducted by aliens and that it was an intentional, creative choice. When you find out that it wasn&#39;t, that can be really damaging, not only to the credibility of the character but to your enjoyment of the show as a whole.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>31.) What does it take for you to stop watching a show?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Common trend I&#39;ve noticed is that it usually takes my favorite person leaving the show to make me stop. Because if they&#39;re still there, even if I disagree with the direction that the show has taken I can take what they give me and edit it into something that I agree with, something that I feel stays true to the characters and what they&#39;re worth.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>32.) If death is often the worst thing that can happen in the real world, why do writers play around with it like a plot tool? (In some cases, they say it&#39;s because they &quot;used up&quot; a character or ran out of stories for them.) Are writers entitled to kill characters who have a certain semblance of reality for viewers?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Again it goes back to laziness or boredom in combination with a desire for ratings. If someone dies, people will watch. It&#39;s really sad that they have to resort to so cheap a trick just to garner attention instead of consistently writing compelling material that sells itself. I suppose they are entitled to kill them off, provided it&#39;s for a genuine, character-based reason. A thing you have to consider too is that in real-life, people die of accidents all the time. Even if a character was killed in a car accident completely randomly, people like us and the audience would scrutinize it as a plot point. In a film class once, our professor told a story about some regular guy who just walked right into an English palace. He never got caught, never encountered any issues. I wish I could remember the actual incident because it truly did happen in real-life. He used it to demonstrate how it&#39;d be an awful film, and explained that life and film, while connected, are different in the way that they are perceived.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>33.) Do you think the prolonged exposure we have to TV characters makes killing them off a different act than killing off a film or book character?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Yes. Again, it all goes back to investment. With a television show that&#39;s been on for years, it almost comes down to simple math - years vs. two hours or the two days it took you to read the book.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>34.) In general, how do you feel about the practice of killing off fictional characters? Do you vote yes or no (or something else)? Why?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I feel if it&#39;s done well (read: it&#39;s not a blatant plot device or plea for ratings), it&#39;s acceptable. If it&#39;s completely gratuitous or makes no sense, it ruins all credibility of the show then and there.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>35.) Do writers have a responsibility to teach their viewers by making their own artistic decisions, or is their main responsibility to give their viewers what they want? Where do you draw the line for what they should be responsible for?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I think it&#39;s not the worst thing in the world to strive for some sort of balance. As an artist, I appreciate that it&#39;s their project and take the &quot;if you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t watch my art&quot; approach, but I also respect that audience is really important and that without it, you&#39;re not as strong or worth as much. This is what bothered me about the aforementioned Greg Yaitanes twitter thing, he acted as if we were worth nothing while refusing to acknowledge that without a passionate audience, they wouldn&#39;t have been 7 seasons in at the time.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>36.) What genre pushes you to get attached to characters most easily? What qualities do they have that pulls you in?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I&#39;ve thought a lot about what gets me attracted to a specific character or actor - they usually need to have a main core quality that I already possess, in addition to one that I desire. A common link and something to hope and strive for. I also want to reference my Fandom Car metaphor - whatever is riding shotgun is whatever I need most at any given time. If I need stability and youth and the idea of a huge uncertain future laid out before me, I gravitate toward X-Files. If I&#39;m feeling misunderstood or unorthodox or complicated and hope to be successful even in spite of those reasons, House is a great thing to fall into.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>37.) Have you ever decided to watch a show because you heard or saw something about a character and immediately knew you were going to fangirl them?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I can&#39;t recall anything at the moment but it&#39;s possible. It&#39;s typical that people can tell me to watch a show as much as they&#39;d like, but I won&#39;t become obsessed unless I find it on my own at the right time.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>38.) Do you see any trends, or common traits, in the characters you frequently find yourself fangirling?</b></p><p class=""p1"">They are strong, they are passionate, they are layered. They can be quirky and free-spirited. This is a hard question to answer because I typically am drawn to actors or relationships.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>39.) Have you ever connected your chosen characters with your past experiences and psychological issues they seem to be related to? If so, what are they?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I really noticed a connection between House/Cuddy and a &quot;relationship&quot; I had with a man in my real-life. I put relationship in quotes because we were never officially together, but we slept together more than once and there was the same complicated chemistry. I feel like having experienced it to some degree in my personal life allowed me to empathize and understand the show relationship much more. And then being with him, or even just exchanging witty banter with him was emphasized because, knowing House/Cuddy, I knew where it could go and how sexy it looked from the outside. I am having a really hard time articulating this right now, lol, even though I feel like I&#39;ve written novels on the subject. I edited House and Cuddy to help me deal with what I was going through in my personal life - they were a beautiful vehicle. I told mine and his story through the videos, and vice versa - feeling their story through us. When I did write small fic about them, I was really writing about us. It gave me so much inspiration to have the two opposite view points/realities to play with. Each fed the other.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>40.) Have you ever noticed your taste in characters or actors evolving and changing as you&#39;ve changed?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I feel like they&#39;ve gotten less shallow - as I grow older, it&#39;s less about loving people who I think are pretty and more about loving people who are great models of character.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>41.) What is your favorite detail or aspect of your favorite television character that makes you love them more than any others?</b></p><p class=""p1"">My favorite character is probably Mulder because I really love his passion for what he believes in. He is told time and time again that he is wrong and crazy but he doesn&#39;t give a shit, for years he goes on trying to prove what he believes in. I am really drawn to that. He is strong and vulnerable at the same time, and his ability to trust Scully is nothing short of inspiring.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>42.) Have they ever changed you? How?</b></p><p class=""p1"">He&#39;s changed me for the better, unquestionably. He taught me that anything you feel that deeply is worth fighting for, even at the risk of alienating people (no pun intended) or being widely considered crazy. He&#39;s taught me that when you find someone who makes you better, even if they are the opposite of you, to hang onto them like hell. He&#39;s made me feel the full spectrum of emotion, and strive to continue to feel it.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>43.) What is the best thing a character or show has ever done for you? The worst?</b></p><p class=""p1"">Aside from things like #42, a character (or other related fandom object - a relationship, an actor, etc) has brought me to the most amazing friends I&#39;ve ever known. Because of fandom, I literally have friends in every corner of the world. My best friend lives in England and has been over to visit three times, planning a fourth for this summer. I can completely be myself around this girl, and it&#39;s because of Cuddy and Lisa Edelstein. I have friends I met through X-Files who I still keep in touch with and I met them when I was 12. I&#39;ve taken road trips from Nashville to New York with incredibly smart women I had never met in person before. I was in line for an American Idol taping and I met up with some fangirls for the first time. One of them was a dance teacher and mentioned that I had really nice fouette turns - I had posted a video of a dance routine on my blog and she remembered that. &quot;I think the reason online friendships are so special is that people can&#39;t be as shallow as they can be in real-life - the friendship is based entirely on words and communication, not how you dress or where your family fits in society,&quot; she said. She&#39;s completely right and I still think about that conversation. Plus there&#39;s a special bond that exists between people who all love the same thing that much - they &quot;get me&quot;. Since I&#39;ve already talked about editing so much, I have to mention that I edited a video of Paula Abdul&#39;s dance career. A girl in the Netherlands saw it and wrote me an extensive letter about how that video changed her life. We spent that entire day just talking, I still remember that day - I was in my first year of college, it was gray and rainy outside and I spent the entire day on my laptop just talking to this amazing new friend. She is unquestionably my soulmate and any time life gets difficult, I think of her and how lucky I am to know her. I know that 95% of people in this world will never know what it feels like to have the kind of connection I have with her and I just feel so fucking blessed every day and every time I hear from her. I still have never seen her in person, but we make video blogs for each other sometimes and have exchanged over 10,000 emails. She is incredibly kind and gentle overall, and I can be so headstrong and brash, but somehow it makes the most sense in the entire world - we both see and feel the world the same. I never would have found her if not for fandom and fandom art, even though we rarely - if ever - talk about those things anymore. We&#39;re going to write a children&#39;s book someday, about long distance friendships. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3&nbsp;</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1"">The worst.... it&#39;s hard for me to think of a &quot;worst&quot;, really. My first year of college I was totally absorbed in House fandom to the point where I feel like I may have missed out on the typical level of social interaction that occurs in college, but if I&#39;m being honest I&#39;m not that big of an extrovert and even to this day if I spend more than three days being consistently social I start to lose my shit. So I&#39;d say that the time I spent in my room honing my editing skills was time well spent. I was led to a close online friendship that took an awful turn and that was incredibly stressful. But one bad apple isn&#39;t enough to cancel out the rest of the grand friendships I&#39;ve made, so it&#39;s hardly the worst in the grand scheme of things. Overall I think characters, shows, and actors have done wonders for my life and for making me into the person I am today.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>44.) What do you think your life would be like today if you had never fangirled anything? Where would you be? What would you be doing? Would you be better or worse off?</b></p><p class=""p1"">I WOULD PROBABLY BE SO FUCKING BORING. I feel like fandom has giving me an amazing sense of humor and enabled me to be much less shy. I used to be so incredibly shy but now I&#39;m much more open and friendly. And - here&#39;s the big one - I would not have developed the artistic skills and inclination that now provide my source of income. I quite literally found a career path through fandom, among all of the other things I&#39;ve mentioned. I wouldn&#39;t have realized my love of editing, I wouldn&#39;t have felt the need to teach myself Photoshop, and these are things that pay my bills now. And beyond that, they are things that I love. I have no idea what I&#39;d be doing now - I might be a writer or I might have graduated with a Psychology degree instead. There is nothing wrong with Psychology and it absolutely still interests me but I do feel like I&#39;d be worse off. I&#39;d express much less, and I feel like I&#39;d be a duller individual.</p><p class=""p2""></p><p class=""p1""><b>45.) Do you think fandom makes us better people? Or worse people? Or something else?</b></p><p class=""p1"">It depends on how you handle it. That crazy bitch who chased Lisa Edelstein through her hotel and almost got arrested? PROBABLY has been made a worse person by fandom. The people who are in their 30&#39;s and living in their mom&#39;s basement with no career ideas because they spend too much time locked in a dark room participating in fandom? Probably worse off. But by in large I think that fandom can make people better - it teaches them to participate in the stories of others, to discover themselves through those stories, it gives them like-minded people to bond with and appreciate, and even when things go wrong it teaches you how to have a thick skin.</p></lj-cut>

I went to my mom's side after that, where I reprised the event of finding awful photos of everyone, turning them into memes, assigning point values and turning them into an egg hunt. When I sat down to do it, I was dreading it and so tired but then I had so much fun that I totally overachieved and everyone else had a blast too. &hearts;

<b>Smash</b> - I FUCKING LOVED THE EDGIER MARILYN NUMBER ON THE BED. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I'D PAY TO SEE THAT BROADWAY SHOW. I know it ended with them saying it was a mistake but they are definitely full of shit lol. I hope that they will eventually gravitate toward a middle ground - keep some of the cutesy, baseball number shit but give it a little edge. I am sad the Michael Swift thing is over? He and Julia were totally hot, even though he did get on my nerves; Like it's fine if you want to fuck around because we're animals and people have chemistry you can't help or whatever, but if you're going to make that big of a possessive deal about it and ""I can't stop thinking about you"" and ""I'm going to keep calling your house"" then I'm sorry but you should probably be breaking up with your wife? IDEK. But I so enjoyed their scenes. Sometimes I wonder if the actor was a tiny miscast but I can never know that lol. Also I am starting to really hate Ivy.

<b>The Big C</b> - I LOVE THIS SHOW SO MUCH IT IS UNREAL. I worry that it's going to start to decline in quality soon but I can't tell if that's legit or just me still being fucked up from The Disappointment That Is House MD. From the season 3 preview it looked like it might be getting a little more quirky, campy, 'out there' trying too hard. IDK. But I loved the ending of this episode, how Paul's heart thing was going off and she was drowning and when he pulled her out of the ice and they laughed and said they were un-killable or whatever, I started crying. This show. &hearts; I HOPE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO COME TO MINNESOTA FOR SOMETHING BECAUSE I WILL BE ALL OVER THAT SHIT.

<b>Dance Moms</b> -  What the fuck just happened. lol. Abby pissed me off in the 'finale', tbh. And I am always on her side, you guys, this is serious. Maddie was a brat but I totally get it.

<b>This Film Is Not Yet Rated</b> - INFURIATED ME, I HATE PEOPLE AND POLITICS GOD GOD, THERE ARE NO WORDS FOR HOW MUCH I HATE SHIT LIKE THIS. And when some director was talking about how they overshot an inappropriate scene on purpose, filled it with obnoxious shots they never even wanted to use just so the MPAA ratings board ""could feel like they pissed on it in someway"" just fucking infuriates me. I am so sick of power-tripping, controlling people who fucking invent non-reasons for themselves to be important and have a job - get a real fucking talent. Actually contribute to the world.

<b>Basic Instinct</B> - I LOVED THIS. I LOVE SEXY THRILLERS. MOAR PLZ, MOAR.

<b>The Hunger Games</b> - we finally saw this and I really liked it! I haven't read the books so I feel like there were some moments where I would have gotten more out of them if I had. That was a grammatically mangled sentence so I hope you understand. Jennifer Lawrence is such a badass and I love her. Like it's not crazy fangirling or anything but I love her. TBH THOUGH, I shipped her with Cinna so much more than I shipped her with Peeta. I didn't get it, and they had so much more natural chemistry. I felt like the ending was a little abrupt? I think I went into it expecting way more bloodshed and fighting. I SHOULD PROBABLY READ THE BOOK THOUGH.

<lj-cut text=""~RL~: basically my grandma found out what an iPad was and bought one an hour later and it was actually the cutest."">Last Friday night, Ali and my sister came to Jason's apartment, we did our nails and had a dance party to old school rap before we walked to dinner. Got super strong drinks and went to a comedy show. ~Lots of LOLS~. My cousin Amanda turned 18, so we took her to the casino the next day. My grandma sent us each $20 to gamble with because she is the cutest. I don't think my cousin liked it much because she only spent $10 and opted to keep the rest. My sister pissed all of hers away on machines like Kitty Glitter and I doubled mine because I am a boss. I tried to give my grandma her money back but she refused. Again, the cutest.

We had Amanda's birthday party on April Fools Day, Jason and I had constructed this huge plan to fool them into thinking we'd broken up, but ultimately we were lazy when it came to putting it into action. My aunt had called my grandma that morning and been like, ""HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING THE NEWS? CELINE OVERDOSED. AND DIED."" And she totally fell for it lol sklfjha. We turned the ceiling fan on full blast and threw dog toys at it. Clay pots and picture frames almost broke and a mirror almost fell off the wall. We call this The Fan Game. Easter is fast approaching, meaning I have to do my Family Meme Easter Egg Hunt again, like tomorrow. I find awful photos of everyone, put meme text on them and assign point values. Then they find eggs with pictures inside, add up the points and the winner gets a cash prize. Then we collage the photos on a poster called The Board of Embarrassment to be immortalized forever.

Ali, Jas and I went to trivia on Monday night. We placed fourth. Our team name was The Multiple Scoregasms. Jason freaked me out a little because I got a Groupon for bedsheets and I just asked if he wanted some. So we were picking out bedsheets and I asked what color he wanted and he said something like, ""You're going to live there too so it's up to you"". I know he didn't mean it the way I took it, but it still kind of made me feel like he was planning my fucking life and choices for me so I freaked out. It's probably not normal, I mean, it's been a year and a half almost, and it's not like I don't fucking spend 75% of my time at his apartment anyway, it's just... IDEK.

My grandma made dumplings for us last night, so delicious. So we went over there (LOL also you guys, I got purple nail polish on the guy whose house we're staying at's bed sheet so I brought it home to see if she could get it out - she got it half out lol) and Jason of course brought his iPad. My grandma was so curious and loved it and totally wanted one. So we kept showing her stuff and omg just watching her marvel at technology, it made my heart grow three sizes just like the Grinch. She was like, ""I'm getting one of these. What do I ask for?"" We said we could help her and she was like, ""Okay let's just go right now! The mall closes in 45 minutes!"" LOL YOU GUYS SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT AN IPAD WAS UNTIL YESTERDAY AND NOW SHE HAS ONE. SHE WAS SO CUTE LEARNING IT, AND <i>SO</I> EXCITED.

And then she was up until at least 2am playing Words With Friends with me. And then she got up at like 6 because she couldn't sleep anymore - she said she was too excited to get up and play her iPad. YOU GUYS, I CAN'T. She's such a boss, dictating her Facebook comments and emails and shit, using a four-finger swipe to switch between apps. I can't."

"event","Tuesday before I left, I went to one of our producers' houses to help her with her taxes and email. I was struggling with whether to go or not, she said she'd pay me $100 cash for the afternoon and I wanted to go but I was so worried that if I did, she'd start to see me as an 'assistant'/office worker type and not as an artist. I probably over-think these things, but I get so cautious about that - I just see how Lindsey got pulled into doing a lot of administrative, non-creative work and I can't have that for myself. I was talking to Jason about it, I said I wanted to go, I don't mind doing data work and I needed the money. ""I'll pay you $150 <i>not</I> to go,"" he said. I am so in love with him, you guys. He is so supportive and he really, truly knows what I'm worth and what I'm capable of. Ultimately, I did go and I'm really glad I did because her house was fucking BEAUTIFUL and it was in the top of the hills - it was fucking terrifying getting there and back - but it was such a lovely, relaxing day. Even doing work. It was the first genuine <i>quiet</i> I think I've had in two months. She showed me what to do and then left so I had amazing Liss time all day in her beautiful home, with her TOTALLY SWEET CAT called Hello Kitty. &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;

My travel day was a bit hellish, my cab was SO late coming to get me (probably #1 thing I hate about LA, no one is ever on time) and I was freaking out but I got there in time. There was a woman ahead of me in the security line who was crying because she lost her phone. I couldn't feel bad for her because she mentioned literally three times that she missed her flight because she ~stopped for a cocktail~. Or five, probably. Also, an observation - alcoholics use the word ""cocktail"" an awful lot, I think it's an effort to distance themselves from the alcohol, it doesn't sound as incriminating as ""a drink"". IDEK. Anyway. So she had this total breakdown in the middle of the airport, another woman next to me had the patience of a goddamn saint trying to help her. She started bawling and the nice lady was like, ""What's wrong now?"" and the drunk lady was like, ""I'VE HAD A SHIT LIFE, OKAY!"" Who the fuck hasn't, amirite. Also, who hasn't ever lost their phone lol.

I had a layover in Vegas. I asked Jason's friend Paul (the one who took me to Cirque) if he wanted to do happy hour but he was busy. P.S. I designed his business cards and they came out so totally sexy, you guys!~ I need to make mahself some new business cards. ANYWAY, I DIGRESS. I just got a bagel and a banana, before I found some desk space with powar and finished this fucking ~schedule~ that I know ultimately won't matter anyway. It was apparently urgent but I sent it on Wednesday, and have yet to hear back from anybody. That's the stuff I'm getting sick of - don't tell me you need stuff ASAP and stress me out about it if you're going to ignore it for (at least) a week. Oh, and! My second flight was on a different airline? So I had to get my luggage, cart it all the way around the airport, and go through security again. A mistake I will never make again, also my suitcase sucks BALLS, ugh UGH IT ALWAYS TIPS. And! I had to pay for it to go through twice! So fucking ridiculous!

I tried to sleep on the plane but couldn't - on the way to Vegas I had a whole row to myself and still couldn't sleep, the flight was so short. On the way home, I watched shows until my computer died. There was a screaming child, and also the bitch next to me was disgusting - she had taken her shoes off, which is fine, whatever, except she was like, curling into a ball on her seat, ~laying on her boyfriend~ and putting her foot in the crack next to my seat. Fucking GROSS. And she never stopped moving. Every five minutes she'd make a huge production out of trying to contort into some new ""sleeping"" position, BITCH YOU ARE ON AN AIRPLANE, NOT AT THE RADISSON. Sleep in your gd seat, with a neck pillow if you must.

I was so excited to see Jason, I came out the doors with a huge smile but when I was about four feet away from him I burst into tears. We hugged for ages and I wish I could have seen it from the outside. I love airports. Sometimes I'm surprised that more people don't act like he and I did, don't express as much - just give a ""HI!"" and a kiss on the cheek - but the idea of it all. I can't say I've ever witnessed such an out-pour as an outsider but I know I will someday, I know it does happen every day. I couldn't stop touching him in the car, it was so strange, it was like we had just started dating even though it's been a year. And being in LA, I've been constantly aware of my surroundings, you know? Constantly looking for and at new things. That has carried over - I saw several things on the car ride home that I've never noticed before, even though I've lived here my whole life. I've also been a little unsure about these roads - I still know where I'm going, I just doubt my turns for a split second. It's really weird. </lj-cut>

I got in at midnight so we just came to Jason's. I got off the elevator and saw his window across the way - he'd turned his Christmas lights on. &hearts; When I walked in, I saw this:

<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v676/lissiexanga/319863_10101846010287520_13958666_76642052_1387887549_n.jpg"" width=""450""></center>
I can't. And you can't see it in the picture but the cutest, unintentional cute thing about it is that he brought in a little spolight because he needed it to be lit properly. &hearts; I love dating an artistic, Apple fanboy. He got a bonus at work, so he got himself the new iPad and me a new Mac. &hearts; AND, god, those tiny things - fruit snacks, chocolate, and chapstick. And that's a bottle of my favorite riesling. It is like, me on a table. And A NEW COMPUTER - you guys, Mia was totally dying and I just kljshfjklas. And he got it with a fancy no-glare screen so I can photoshop/write outside. He told me it wasn't just a computer, it was an investment in my future because he knows I'm going to be great. And he put Adobe CS5 on it and Final Cut and Final Draft and Aperture and I can't, I can't. I feel like I sound like such a spoiled brat or that I'm not making a big deal out of this but I am really, truly appreciative and almost can't even believe that I've found someone so sweet. He tells me I deserve it, that it means a lot to him that he's able to do this after I took a chance on and stuck by him when he was in debt, in a crappy apartment with a mattress on the floor. I'm really proud of him. If I look at the Jason I knew before we started dating and the way he is now, it is a night and day difference. 

He made me stir fry at 2 in the morning. And shit like that - unique, out of the ordinary circumstances however small just... &hearts; We went to bed. ""I'm home :),"" I said up at him. ""Now I'm home too,"" he replied. &hearts;"

"event","<b>Thursday</B> was BASICALLY the most perfect day, you guys - <lj user=""foxestacado""> and I were going to go to yoga, but we got there like an hour early. So we just walked around, and found ourselves at a fancy cupcake shop, where we got six mini cupcakes and each chose three from their MULTITUDE OF HEAVENLY FLAVORS. I got red velvet, cookie dough, and s'more cupcakes! The most aesthetically pleasing and also delicious cupcakes in all of time ever. The guy working was SO fun and friendly too, he saw us with our yoga mats and was like, ""Is this before or after yoga?"" We said before and he was like, ""I'm sorry, I can't sell these to you."" lol. ""No I'm serious, you have to come back after class."" lol akljhdfa. We got drinks at Starbucks and then sat outside and checked our internetz.

Then we went to yoga and it was awesome, I haven't done yoga in aaaaages. And the teacher was so nice and helpful, she asked my name, remembered it, and continued to give me corrections which I always appreciate. I am SOAR. Even today lol. We had planned on going for burgers after class but neither of us were hungry. We struggled for something to do but then she got the idea to go get massages. SO WE GOT MASSAGES. We got this 70 minute acupressure/reflexology business, but there was also a scalp massage AND BUTT MASSAGE WHICH IS MY FAVORITE IN ALL OF EVER, and they also did cool stretchy things!! There was a foot soak and foot massage and they basically massaged all the things. Such a worthy investment.

We found a burger bar a few blocks away, and we loved everything about that place! The atmosphere, the food, the lighting, the music. We had a talk about how LJ has been more or less abandoned and check us out, having open conversations about LJ with real people in public.

Yesterday, I went for an early dinner with my friend Ana - she's an actress/musician from Minnesota who I met at a New Year's party through mutual friends. She just moved out here and she lives seriously a mile away from me! So we went to Santa Monica, walked for a bit and ended up at a bar that had a bitchin' Happy Hour, omg we got so much - pizza, french fries, shrimp cocktail, bacon rolls, and some artichoke shit. AND OMG THERE WAS THIS <i>OLD</I> WOMAN THERE, SERIOUSLY, 86 YEARS OLD, drinking a fucking lemon drop martini like a BOSS. Her son was sitting next to me and we were kind of talking and I told him that she was fucking cool and he told me that she dyed her hair green for St. Patrick's Day!! And then she lifted off her tiny knitted cap to SHOW ME!! OMG it made my life, you guys.

It was really fun, Ana is SO much fun and so lovely to talk to - we never shut up basically the entire time. She is so personable and honest, and I'm happy we could get along so well after only ever meeting once. And she was like, ""I love your <a href=""http://alyssakristine.com/blog"">blog</a> - that day you wrote about airports, I was reading it and I was like, 'my god she speaks the truth and totally gets me'."" And that was awesome even though I never update that fucker - I NEED TO, I REALLY NEED TO. But like, how cute that she read it and brought it up.

And then she asked if I'd ever want to exhibit my photos and I was like duh, yeah, and she's a painter so she asked about doing an exhibit together and it was SUCH a fun conversation! And THEN we went shopping and she bought a red skirt and I bought red pants with white shirts because we needed matchy ART GALLERY OUTFITS, OMG HOW CUTE ARE WE. She was talking about how it's so hard to make friends out here and how glad she was that I'm here and it kills me because we like, actually get along and think similarly about a lot of things.

Lindsey texted saying Brit's friend was house sitting a mansion in Silver Lake or something and asked if I wanted to go but I was having too much fun shopping. When I got back, Florence + the Machine was BLASTING through our house and she was in the shower. She decided she didn't want to go to the party either, so we watched Sex & The City and made a bong out of an apple (because we are in 5th grade) so we could smoke the weed that Tony left here in an old film canister lol. Then we watched Drop Dead Gorgeous, you betcha!

<b>~*~</b>

We are no longer shooting this weekend (lol, obv). We are shooting next weekend, when I will be back home again. So I'm pretty pissed about that because being on set is one of the only reasons I continue to do this right now. I am so excited to go home though!"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Production meeting &amp; general production talk. Should I make a filter, lmao"">Had a production meeting on <b>Friday</b>. It was really helpful because everyone was there - DP, Art, Wardrobe, Director, 1st AD - and it was just super useful to me because the more I know about what they're doing and how they're doing it, the easier it is for me to understand what I need to be doing and how. We shoot this weekend, I'm excited but really nervous because I won't have help or a multitude of the equipment I got to use last time. Anyway, the meeting went on for three hours and it was really cool to have ""BTS"" as its own point of discussion on the outline. And then I got to talk about stuff and it sounded like I really had my shit together even though I'm nervous and new lol. \o/

After that I went to meet with a new producer who needs stills for his webseries. I will probably write about that later because there are some issues. Like transportation, for example - I took a plane here instead of my car because I felt like I'd be kept busy with this one show the whole time. So when other stuff crops up, it's a huge pain in the ass. When I told him this, though, he said that he'd get a PA to pick me up at home because they really need me. Which feels great, let's be real. They shot today and I didn't go (again, more issues asdkfhjajkh I can't, you guys, I can't), I haven't heard about tomorrow but I'm going to try hard for Wednesday because I've been told it's a big fun day. I don't know - it's a free favor I'd be doing so I'm not moving mountains to be there, but if it works out and it's easy, I'd love to go because I love being on set and I really love photography.</lj-cut>

<b>Saturday</b>, I woke up to RAIN! It made me so happy to hear it pounding down as I was just waking up, drifting between dreams. I love sleeping during rain. <lj user=""foxestacado""> picked me up (the street was even a little bit flooded!) and we went to The Getty Museum, but not before taking ~the scenic route~ *cough*goinginacircle*cough*, BUT I SAW SO MANY PRETTY HOUSES THAT I WANT FOR MY OWN. The museum was WONDERFUL - we had to take a tram thing up the hill, it is on top of a hill you guys, and I've been informed that on non-foggy days, you can see the ocean off in the distance. BUT IT WAS SO FOGGY WE COULD NOT SEE <i>ANYTHING</I>, IT WAS SO TRIPPY AND AMAZING. And really inspiring actually because I have an idea for a webseries about dreams and stepping outside, it was like I walked right fucking into it. LIKE, LOOK:

There's still a lot of art there I need to see! &hearts; We went for lunch, she had been insisting that I try ramen but I put it off because I am afraid of trying new things, lol, especially food. But we went and it wasn't even awful! Big GIRL try new things! There was this... tofu-like Spam thing with a pink spiral in it and I was so amused by it I don't even know why. AND THEN OH MY GOD, SPEAKING OF AMUSING - THEY HAD A LITTLE JAPANESE MARKET WITH SO MANY CUTE THINGS, LIKE VEGETABLE CUTTERS IN CUTE SHAPES AND TINY, *TINY* LUNCH BOX THINGS. And, and, fucking KOALA YUMMIES, I bought a huge box and also a cool soda with fantastic design elements.

<b>Last night</b>, Tony and his friend Justin came over, along with Lindsey's friend Brit (who is super awesome, btw - we are going to take dance classes together!). We were going to go get Chinese food for dinner but we got lost, first of all. Tony made a joke about how it was like LOTR, and I was like, ""One does not simply walk into Panda Express!"" and he was like, ""YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"" and maybe you had to be there but it was hilarious. The girls wanted sushi, so I had planned on just making something at home but when we pulled up I saw that there was a sandwich place next door that I had been wanting to try - Which Wich lol sdlfjhsa. AND IT WAS SO CUTE, I had to fill out my order on the side of a bag with a series of ticky boxes and I love ticky boxes and also, Sharpies. They had a wall in the back that was FULL of brown sandwich bags that people had drawn pictures and written messages on - stuff like that always, always puts a smile on my face.

I got back to the car, and the girls weren't back yet so Tony and I were just like, sitting in the back seat waiting. BUT THEN, LOL, LOL, he pulled up his Sex Offender Locator app and we played a came where we'd click on people and try to guess their pervy offense just by looking at their picture. Shit like that - I love hanging out with Tony. It is never dull. We came back and I watched TV with Jason over Skype for an hour and then I went back to the party. We had a <blink>Power Hour</blink>, which, if you're not familiar, is a fucking LETHAL GAME, okay. Tony had an app for it - it'd play a song for one minute, and then a buzzer would go off and we'd all have to take a shot of beer. We did that for an entire hour with no stopping. Oh my god I got so drunk so fast. 

And then we ended up having a dance party at two in the morning (lol, always a natural progression) and I was <i>so happy</i>, you guys. Justin had left and Tony was off brooding somewhere but Lindsey, Brit and I were having so much fun, dancing and singing so loud, going all out to the likes of Spice Girls and Celine Dion. Lindsey and I also had a stunning rendition of Africa by Toto. I remember at one point, Brit and I fell and just spent <i>ages</i> laughing and rolling all into each other, just dying. I really love dancing, even when it's ridiculous, drunk ""interpretive"" shit on the living room rug. There was just so much love and it wasn't just that I was happy, it was that everyone was happy, and in that moment everything we needed in the world felt like it was right there. Tony took tons of pictures, but he never posts any so I will have to steal them. He also took some video which I'd probably rather not see lol. Whatever - totally worth it. We didn't even care that we had to get red wine out of the carpet this morning. Then we just cuddled up in blankets and watched Dance Moms all day. There's a killer futon in the living room here, which we've elected to leave out like a bed, covered with blankets at all times. It is so cozy. All three of us were crammed on it, with food and covers, and Brit fell asleep wearing a turquoise tiara. &hearts;"

He curates bonsai trees on the side (ironically, he is <i>amazing</I> at it, and his father resents him for succeeding where he has failed - it is a trend in the Smart family).

I got an extremely pink pear drink and the first decent burger I've had since I've been here. We all stacked our phones in the middle of the table and the rule was that whoever grabbed/needed their phone first had to buy a round of drinks. lol. Then he spouted off about how ""the more I used technology, the less I know about myself"", which I adamantly disputed, obviously. We walked down the Santa Monica Pier and back again, there was a group of people doing a scavenger hunt - they needed to give $5 to someone named Bob. Tony asked what else was on their list, and this girl needed to be kissed by a stranger under fake mistletoe. He was against it at the beginning, so I considered it just for fun, but he gave in and did it first. Then he blew us off to go on a ~date~ with some crazy bitch/fuck buddy and I only know about it because Lindsey was randomly like, ""I have a question for you - do you ever tell guys you're just fucking that you want to have babies?"" I was like, ""UM, NO? What the fuck?"" and then she told me that apparently some girl Tony's ""with"" keeps talking about it? LOL, winner winner chicken dinner. So he went to dinner with her and was going to come over after that, we were going to have a sleepover, make ~special brownies~ and watch movies but he totally bailed so Lindsey and I have decided we are going to Baby Bomb him, meaning sign him up for a bunch of fatherhood newsletters and spam.</lj-cut>

<b>&rarr;</b> I had an AWFUL night/morning of weird sleeping. I got woken up and then every time I started to fall back asleep, I'd hear a phone vibrating. Except it wasn't my phone. It happened like 5 times, and always just as I was falling asleep. It was like a fucking auditory hallucination and it freaked me out. Then there was one point where I swore someone was in my room. It freaked me the fuck out and then I couldn't sleep anyway. By some miracle, I <i>did</i> sleep eventually, only to be woken up at 6:30 in the morning by some bitch BLARING music outside, some stupid song about ""what are you waiting for?~"" and I'm pretty sure she was singing in the shower. Except I'm not so sure because I heard that stupid fucking song AGAIN TODAY.

<b>&rarr;</b> I have had creepy, totally vivid dreams lately and I'm pretty sure it's because Lindsey and I watch a shit ton of Alias with wine like, every fucking day, just before bed. Oh shit. We just watched the episode where they ~hooked up~. Michael Vartan is SO cute and totally my type but I kind of ship Syd with Will? IDEK IDEK.

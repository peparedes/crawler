However, the real selling point is the controller.  This SOB has two sticks, three foot pedals and 40 buttons (one for cleaning your windshield).  It also has lights on the controllers.  I immediately swooned upon seeing this.

Hopefully this game comes out for other systems, but if it doesn't then I may be forced into buying a X-Box. BARF!!!

           KRAID SMASHES HIS 20th DING-DONG

      During Tuesdays 12-8 slugfest between the victorius Robber Barons (managed by G. Madonia) and Fairlawn News (managed by G. Schray),  the Barons' Kraid hit his league leading (not counting the computer teams) 20th homerun.  The blast to right field came off Queen' at the top of the 5th.

      Also of note, Galaga hit 3 homeruns bringing him to 15 for the season.  Apple was pulled after only the 4th inning after giving up 7 earned runs (this raised Apple's ERA to a disgusting 1.47)."

Here's the background info:  

The game is called Alien Soldier, it's for the Genesis.  Treasure (Radiant Silvergun, Bangai-O, Contra Hard Corps, etc...) developed the game and it's in the vain of Contra, but it's almost all boss battles.

The gentleman selling it says it's in mint condition (I don't really care) and the price includes shipping.

Also keep in mind that I collect games made by Treasure, so one day I'll have to own this anyway.

Also the Besting Buy had copies of the Dark Crystal for 11.99.  Thanks to the Big J upstairs for my being on a video game/pizza hut budget.

Finally after seeing Schray's top ten games, I felt inclined to do one as well.  Here they is, in no particular order:

Galaga (arcade)
Ms. Pac Man (arcade)
Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (SNES)

What are your feelings on sniper rifles?
What are your feelings on Dungeons and Dragons?
Do you like Chompers from the Taco Bell?

If anyone can think of some better questions I'm open to suggestions.

4) Your games look oh so good (especially Rouge Leader and Luigi's Mansion)
5) You do not have high priced screensavers (Halo)
6) In fact you don't have any screensavers, because you're not a computer in disguise

"event","My dear friends, I am glad to be able to write this entry, for this was a trying few days.

It all began when rumors of a haunting began circling at the Gold Circle.  My ears pricked at once, for I have always been interested in the paranormal and I fancy myself as a part time ghost hunter.  The nature of the rumors were that a ghost had been haunting Walhaven and more precisely the Citgo/Krispy Kreme at the corner of Hawkins and Market St.  

I had a general feeling of who the apparition was in his formal life, so I packed my bag and journied to the aforementioned spot.  The proprietor of the Citgo understood my need to investigate further and he allowed me stay past hours.  The hours dragged by as I allowed myself to snack upon Mountain Dew Code Red and Zero bars.  Finally, at 1:30 I began to hear noises behind the Slim Jim stand and I headed that way.  Upon turning the corner I saw an apparition so frightening that I immediately knew that my life would never be the same.  

It most certainly was the ghost of one J.R. Short.  Although a good man in life, he was a spectre with awesome power.  The mere sight of him made my skin crawl.  After that feeling had passed I suddenly realized why Mr. Short would haunt this fine establishment: Krispy Kreme's cream sticks lacked the proper amount of maple and had too muck cream!!!

Although I realized this was a perfect reason to cause terror I still could not allow this haunting to continue.  I fumbled in my pack for what I thought would vanquish the ghost.  I pulled out two pictures, one of Walhaven from approximately a year ago and the other post Sandwich board.  Although I did some damage to the apparition, it only seemed to anger him.  He immediately struck and his touch was almost to much to handle.  I felt myself age almost fifty years!  That's correct I am now almost 72 years old.  I was able to pull myself together only due to the fact that I had trained with the Boglins in the west.

I gained my senses and struck with what I had left:  the exact description of what a Rax ""burger"" tastes like.  The ghost instantly vanished and my work was done.  

If anyone has a spell, scroll or potion that could reverse my unnatural aging please contact me.

Truthfully,
Yours truly"

That's right, I'm back.  The reason that I have not been able to update my journal is a complicated one.  It seems that I was being held captive in a werewolf's lair (or den if you're from the other side of the atlantic).  

He was a kind werewolf and treated me well, but I yearned for the city lifestyle and all it's joys.  The things I missed most were (in a very particular order): Arthur Treacher, and Centurians.  

I missed Arthur for his company and his hush puppies.  

Well, I must get going, I have yet to stuff the werewolf's or bury his heart at a crossroads.

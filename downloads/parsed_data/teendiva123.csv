IT REALLY DOES!!!  and the more i think about it; it just pisses me off more cuz here i am thinking if we as christians believe we should fully rely on god why arent we, its always bout the money, no matter what, u do thats what its about.  I HATE MONEY, I HATE TALKING BOUT MONEY, I HATE IT. not becuase i dont have any, its because its a watse of time.  if god wants me too run around buck naked with a spear in my hand thats what i am gonna do.  its soooo killin me inside it really is.  I dont want another year go by and i am sittin here tryin to make sure o.p.p. is all protected when i could be fallin on my knees worship god....i wanna bumper sticker that says ""I'd rather be worshiping"". how come we as christians cant get enough balls to forget everything a go after what god is calling us to do?"

"event","well after being stood up by my best friend who doesnt pick up the phone, i was pretty much in a pissed off mood.  I decided to go to the conference at cbn and it was awesome...Tim was there and so was Porter.  I did get my revalation and calling this weekend.  My head seems a bit more clear.  And i know what i gotta do.  Only Jessica knows though and she said it was AWESOME and she was Blown away by what God called me to do.  She knows I dont know where to begin but it gonna be sweet! and thats okay.  I did get to drive i was nervous and ummm bored, haha!!!  But i had an awesome time just laughing and laughing with jeremy, ray, chrissy, sheryl, lynn, lar dawg, mike, amanda, melvin, jess, tim, porter, and whoever else i forgot. it was awesome. Oh snap how i could i forget Ms. Staphanie, me and amanda are gonna spend a weekend with her in williamsburg soon. she is sooooo much fun and sooooo down to earth.  she is gonna introduce us to her sons... who are 18 and 20.  HOLLER!!!! I didnt get to speak to Dustyn that nuch this weekend but she had things to do and things to talk about with others and i hope she's happy with everything. To wrap up my awesome weekend without any drama or depression...jess and i went to IHOP with the christian surfers which was amazing cuz were just laughing in that place like nobody's business and i got home about 11:30....SWEET HUH?


p.s. though i am still pretty pissed off at natalie....i just cant let that ruin my day, maybe we can talk about it later...but for right now i'd rather not!"

What would my parents say if they knew i was taking some sort of depression pills?  So far all day today i have the same expression on my face...which is no expression.  I just feel blank....no ur not getting it... I am not feeling anything.

I did have a fun nite on friday, with all my fav people.  I met this new guy named Rob, and what an awesome guy he is.  Very funny.  Tim and i shared a few giggles.  Nattyskins and Bunnycupcakes, it was awesome seeing thier beauty in my presence once again.  Gloria hypnotized the crowd with her awesome music skills and beauty. and i just tried to keep the laughter going.

"event","Last nite was fun....I talked to Heather, She is sooooo sweet.  There were like some 12, 13, 14 year old boys there.  From far away they were pretty hot...til i saw how old they were.  Kenny and i are kool again i guess... he was one hilarious dood last nite.  We were sittin in his dad's truck (waiting for Ken for like and hour...seriously)  and we were singing my boo by alicia keys and usher or Big pimpin by Jay-z (I cant remember). And all of a sudden we saw a bright ass flash of green light...This muther-fucker gets out of the truck to see what it was.  Like a dumb ass white person in a horror flick.  I was bout to jump in the driver seat kick his ass away from the door and leave his ass right there.  Haha. It was hilarious...i think he forgot to take his meds or something because he was a wild child.  I didnt get to see my boo boo Jonathan...i wander how he is doin. He can pluck my guitar strings anytime...Holla!

Xmas is comin and i am just not really lookin forward to it like use to be.  Now i know all my gifts whats the point of acting all excited...I still cant believe Tammy bought me all that stuff... I love her.  M.U.R. is coming along beautifully and looks fantabulous.  I cant wait to sleep in 2morrow.  And to see the gayness in kalani's and melissa's eyes for the proposal...gay gay gay gay gay GAY!!!  gag gag gag gag gag GAG!!"

"event","So ummmmm.....i dunno what to say.  Oh yea Lil Kenny is here today, and i feel like kickin some ass, but whatever.  I am getting a little irratated by this whole A.S.S. being broken into.  I wish They would just fix the security gate, it would make me less stressed and the customers would feel secure.  Its killing me!  Its killing A.S.S.! I just want to lay down with my headphones and music on and block off everyone i know. (And yea that includes you)  Sometimes you need to have time for yourself without worries, dood.  And I know waaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy to many people who are stressful.  I am not saying that i am not stressful to people, but hey if u are stressful person; thats just what u are. Anyway, I need a serious vacation and i am working to hopefully take a long one in my own place."

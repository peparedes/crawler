I wanted different. I wanted a challenge. I wanted to be the token white guy. Well I guess i got what i wanted.

I am not sure what happen. I did everything correctly i thought. I ended my safari (more on this next post) and booked my bus ticket back to Nairobi to catch my flight. I had a light meal before boarding, i went to the bathroom and i had an unopen bottle of water for the ride. I boarded the bus.

I ended up - I am not sure where i am. This city is not on the map and therefore not listed in my guide book. All i know is that i am no where near Nairobi. 

Somehow I boared the wrong bus headed in the opposition direction. Not in panic but now in survival mode. I needed to either get a refund on my ticket and book a plane, train, or camel back to Nairobi. 

I will keep you posted.

"event","Today was suppose to be a relaxing day of walking around drinking coca-cola out of a bottle. I had two items on the infamous ""To Do List"". One was to find a post office and mail out postcards and the other was to get to a bank for US dollars. Alright, this sounds like easy enough tasks. 

SO, i go off searching for a post office, i soon learned that there was none nearby. SO, i go off looking for postage for the postcards. Its seemed that everyone knew the postman, ali-balk, but not where i could find stamps. I would go into shops selling postcards and simply asked if they had stamps and the motion to my postcards. The retail worker would then grab someone off the street that spoke English and use them as a translator. In the end i would get pointed down the street. An hour and a half later i managed to find a store keeper that would sell me stamps - for a modest profit- and for extra points he spoke English. Alright, so after i attached my stamps it was time to find a mail box...... this was going to be hard. I reviewed the bible, lonely planet's guide on Egypt, and the only things it said was that it would be blue. Alright, I'm looking for a blue box. I guessed i looked puzzled and the storekeeper from whom i purchased the stamps from came out to help. ""You want to mail?"", he questioned, ""yes"" i said. ""Follow"" he replied.

We walk down to the end of the street to this maze of traffic mayhem. He points to a Mosque and says the the mail box is located across the street from it. The directions were clear and i had a good inclination of where i was going, however.... i would have to cross this street of about 7 lanes of traffic to get to the other side. This was the test of whether or not i could truly walk like an Egyptian. I felt fear at that moment but the job had to be done. I decided to tackle it in two parts for the there was a island in the middle where i could seek refuge. So i started off into the street, shoulders squared and eyes facing only slightly over my shoulder. I walk.... cars race through, i walk some more then pause. I walk at an angle then a quick pivot on one foot to change directions. I always kept moving, sometimes walking parallel from the direction i came. Then it occurred to me that, - I'm doing it , I'm doing it, I'm walking like an Egyptian. I made it safely to the island and eventually across the other side to my mail box.... 

Task #1-Complete


The rest of the errands went off without a hitch. I went to the bank and exchanged Egyptian Pounds for American Dollars and then grabbed some lunch.

When i returned back to the hotel, i was greeted at the front door by armed men. As soon as they learned i was American i was able to pass. I walked pass a group of men. There was five guys in full suits and four bodyguards. I quickly walked pass and went straight to the evaluator. I stood there waiting for the elevator when these same guys walked over. There we all were waiting for the elevator. I slowly inch my way to the back of the line and out of site. Now when i say elevator think, old rustic chamber attached to a donkey. When the donkey walks away from the building the moving chamber goes up and when he walks towards the building the chamber goes down. Now i know that was not how it worked but this evaluator's technology wasn't that far off from it being just a donkey.  So anyways, two guys in suits get in and then they motion for me to get in as well. I tried to decline but then one of the armed men insisted and i didn't want to disappoint him. That was that, they got off on the second floor and i proceed to the fifth floor to my room.

well, this will be my last post from Egypt. Next stop Kenya!

"event","I got to see all that i wanted to see in Luxor. This place is home of ancient ruins, tombs of pharaohs and the Nile river. I feel like a druglord hiding out in some distance Miami mansion. I have armed guards patrolling the compound and every time i walk pass them they stand and say hello, ""sir."" I just nod in agreement and say, ""carry on"" or ""as you were."" I have this nice 8-story hotel all to myself, there maybe four or five other guest. The other night i wanted to watch the stars and sit by the pool. I went up to the pool and within minutes a complete was staff was provided to serve me. I had the bellhop, a waiter, guest services, the night manager and the hotel operations managers checking in on me every few minutes. I would make a slight rotation in my seat and all would stand to attention. The attention was fun at first but it became old really fast. When I checked out more tourist were checking in for the weekend but still a very low turnout.

Yesterday, i floated down the Nile in my own felucca , just like baby Moises. It was very relaxing a great way to escape the heat and my hotel. And now I'm back in Cairo thinking that i should have stayed in Luxor one more day or went further south. 

Last night i came to Cairo by sleeper train. I had to share the cabin with this very delusional man. This guy seemed to have all the answers but no language to express them. He was from,,,hrm... I'm not sure where he was from. He was straight up crazy! He would talk about something and then go off on a tangent that would end with him making a sketch drawing. He was saying how white people are first world and black people are third world and that I'm second world because I'm in the middle. At one point he left and the train attendant came over and apologized over and over. This is when i stole one of his drawings as proof of what i was experiencing and enduring for this train ride.

yup yup yup....

anyways, i think i have been at this computer long enough."

"event","The Train Ride:

I have always enjoyed train rides and was looking forward to this one to luxor. There is something exciting about being stuck sitting across the table from a complete strange for many hours. You have no choice but to talk and by the end you have exhausted all topics of conversations. Well, my loneliness continued... i was in a car all by myself. I decided to make the most of it and kicked off the shoes and made myself comfortable. The private car came complete with a radio with one station  --- type of music? 70's and 80;s love songs. Just when i thought i was about to go crazy, my dinner arrived. i think i ate camel but the white camel. the power in the car went out moments later and dinner was had by flashlight.

Luxor:

Hotel - 
So i rented this PHAT room located on the Nile. Its really nice and kinda expensive. I think im paying $15US but the room is worth it. I have a pool and a private balcony over looking the nile. the hotel was recommended by a fellow traveler but she failed to mention the price. i was to tired to care at three in the morning. 

Today - 
I played tourist all day today. I went to the valley of the kings and queens. I went in side tombs of dead kings and queens. Went to a place where they made alabaster pottery. Kinda cool. i was with a group met some cool irish girl. The tour started at around 8:30 and ended around 3:30. I long time in the sun. 

Tourism -
I was told that after the next to last terrorist bombings in 1999. The visitors to luxor were about 6,000 a day. Today that number is around 900. There is nobody here, this place is like a ghost town. In my 8 story hotel i have only seen a hand full of people. Most of the people we seen today thanked us for being there. Kinda depressing.

well, im here for one more night and two more days. tomorrow is more sight seeing and then back up to cairo and maybe alexadria.

"event","I'm lonely here. 

today was the first day that my mind wasn't cloudy although I'm still not 100% health wise. I decided that now is time to start getting shit done and paint this town red. I took a taxi to the train station to book a ticket for a night train to Luxor. ( I leave in about two hours) Instead of taking a taxi back i decided to take the metro for fun, this was an adventure all by itself. I somehow managed to buy my self a ticket and get to where i was going. Nobody spoke english and there wasn't even a map of the train route. I just picked a direction and guessed which stop. 

I venture to the Egyptian Museum by myself. I was invited to go here yesterday with some girls from Norway but i was in no condition to leave my room. yesterday after leaving the pyramid i felt really ill and after updating my live journal i lied in bed for most of the day. The museum was alright i guess, a little overwhelming. i saw some mummies, that was kinda spookie, i hope i don't have nightmares. Speaking of nightmares, last night was malaria pill night but all went well. 

but yeah, I'm lonely. its seems most of the travelers at the guesthouse are just down to do there own thing. i met this one kiwi, he was cool but talked so fast that i couldn;t understand him. he might be down to hang out but he just came in today and im leaving tonight. i was suppose to go to this light and sounds show at the pyramids last night with this girl from south africa but i was in bed. i saw her this morning and she is going tonight but i still have my train ride. it seems right after i checked out and these other single travelers checked in. 

no friends for me... 

alright, no worries cause I'm still off to luxor and people there will like me.

on a happier note. my walk like an Egyptian has really improved. today i crossed five lanes of fast moving traffic. i think what they mean by walk like an Egyptian is to be able to move gracefully in any direction on a moments notice. the way it works is that you start walking into traffic. the drivers will not stop but will try to  veer around you. you might have to walk parallel for a step or two but you objective is to always keep moving as well. i actually had a side view mirror hit my ass - i shit you not!

alright, let's catch a train.

"event","First i must mention that the cough has subsided and has slowly moved into the sinus area. This makes matters worse cause now i can't breath =( But despite my poor health. i was determined to see the pyramids and make the most of this trip. 

I hired a taxi for the afternoon to take me there. I'm not sure how it happened but somehow i got talked into renting a horse and riding around the pyramids. I was nervous about being on a horse that i really didnt enjoy the pyramids. Matter of fact all that i could think about was getting off the horse. The whole trip lasted about 3 hours and towards the end i was getting the hang of stirring a horse. Its alot harder then it looks and sounds. I think i might go back but not on a horse. As for camels, those beast are the nasties things ever.

thats really all to report. i think i need more medication and a nap. i met this girl and together we are going to see this light and sound show at the pyramids later tonight. she is south african but has been all over including san francisco.

another thing that keeps coming up in conversation is the term walk like an Egyptian. This guy was showing me how to walk across the street and navigate around cars. He said, ""follow me and walk like an Egyptian."" He then squared his back and lowered his hips and started walking. The encounter and demontration was something straight out of a saturday night live skit. There was no crazy arm movements but it was very similar to what we know as to walk like an egpytian

alright, im out.

"event","i just woke up from a power nap, i was hoping to sleep through the night but my cold has turned for the worse and is keep me up. 

but these are my thoughts so far.

if thailand is traveling 101, then egpyt is upper division course requirement. for starters im the only white person and not alot of people speak english.  i went to this roadside kitchen and ordered some food. well i knew the guy didn't speak engligh cause why would he. in my most charismatic voice, i asked what he recommended and what was the special of the day. He looked at me and laughed and then yelled for an English speaker whom worked across the street. that was my meal =)

there are not alto of travelers around, just locals. i spent the day by myself just walking the streets of Cairo. i am getting better with crossing the street but it still scary as hell.

where are the touts? i was fully prepared to be tackled by touts at the airport but there were none. this one guy offered my a ""proper car ride"" for 75egp. i went with a cab ride for 50EGP. later in the day i came across another guy that wanted to give me his business card but once inside he introduced me to the owner and disappeared.

Speaking of money , i still haven't figured out the whole bargaining thing. i dont feel the prices im paying are inflated. i think they think im egpytian and im getting the locals prices. Example, i paid 1 EGP for a bottle of water, which is less than 1/5 of a US dollar. In thailand the price would have been 10 baht which is 1/4 of a dollar. My meal mentioned earlier coast 1.25 EGP which comes to maybe .30 cents. i am not sure but im figuring it out slowly.

but i most mention that i feel Egpytians are nice hearted people for the most part. i've had good experiences with everyone that i have come across.

as for cairo. its a rather large old decaying urban sprawl. my building of my guest house is maybe 6/7 stories. most of the first several stories are gutted and vacant. the whole calling to prayer is rather spookie and happens throughout the day, although nobody seems to pay much attention.

that is just today. tomorrow im headed to the museum and pyramids in the afternoon. if my health improves then i will head south to luxor,if not i will stay in cairo another day to rest.

alright, time to wander.

"event","Alright Kiddies,

I'm going to make this quick because im tired, its hot and i'm sick.  I just landed about three hours ago in Egpyt. I was not ready for this, this is not traveling 101 anymore but im managing. I already found a room and some drugs for my cough. 

So far what really strikes me as dangerously different is the way pedestrians cross the street. Yesterday when i was hanging out with Alex, i noticed how new yorkers don't adhere the the crossing signs. I asked alex what was up and he said that here people just go with the flow. Well egypt is that mindset to the tenth power. here in egpyt you just walk into traffic and *hope* nobody hits you.  Its crazy cars are going at really good speeds but they just swerve around people crossing. 

anyways, i need a shower and some sleep.

"event","hi, i haven't posted in awhile but tonight's events i believe need to be stated for the record. This night started at the local neighborhood bar with my fellow neighbors, it was suppose to be an early night but one thing lead to another.

So, at the first bar i met my partner in crime. This guy is always a good time when we hang out. He insisted that i play catch up and continued to feed me drinks until i was good and ready for want was in-store for me that night.

After i got my drinking hat on, we went to a trance party. I have been to trance parties in the past but this was a totally new experience to me. I have always said that RAVING is a young persons sport but i have always said this as a young person. The crowd was young. The party was familiar in many respects but foreign nonetheless. The location has been a venue for Harmony parities in the past but this time it was different. I ran into one old friend , he shall remain nameless but this guy is the hardest working man in the scene and deserves much respect. He has stuck true to his beliefs and wears his heart on his sleave....

So I lasted about 60 ,,minutes at this party.  Don't get me wrong , the place looked nice and the people that were there seemed to be having a good time but it just wasn't my scene.... i guess i been there , done that and i was out.... I was a little upset because one deejay started playing an Underworld track and i didn't feel that he had the right to do so....

Next we went to 1015 to see what kind of trouble we could get into there. Well there was no trouble but we ran into friend whom gave us drink tickets and we had a really good time for cheap. When i say cheap read free. The music was better - some progressive trance and house. I thought the night was over but we ran into another familiar face from the past that told us about a party at Mezzanine.

By this time we had to act face. We were running low on time so we thought our time would be best served at Anu which is a local hip bar around the corner from Mezzaine. We proceeded to order shots and beers until last call.

Afterwards we went to Mezzanine, which is probably one of the best clubs in SF, to dance the night away. Just got home a little while ago and im ready for bed. Tonight was a good night. How was everyone elses night?"

"event","Alright , i guess alot has been happening since i last posted to my live journal. I now live in San Francisco and have been living here for almost six months, its crazy cause it seems like yesterday i was just moving. I really didn't feel at home for a couple months , i felt like i was just visiting. I was never able to sleep throughout the night but eventually all the changed. I am now consider myself ""Joey from the block"". I walk outside my door and i feel the sense of community in which i live. I say hello to Jonnie the store shop owner who i live next to. I walk to the corner store and buy a diet coke for the same lady every morning who wishes me a good day. I pass by officer daniel the beat cop. I wave to my hairstyles who's shop is not to far from my house, but i am not going back, i didnt like my last cut. I recognize all the homeless and they have all stopped asking me for money and i think i have patronized all the restaurants and bars in the area. i guess it is safe to say that i like my new home and i feel very comfortable here. 

and this place just seems to be getting better. i live with two great roommates who are also great friends, i have more friends that live a few blocks away and new friends are moving into the area, plus im always meeting new people.."

"event","i am a little sad right now. i was watching the news and there was a report of a house blowing up in cupertino. for some reason i felt this little thing inside of me telling me not to turn the channel. i watched and i started to notice the neighborhood and then i saw the tree i would play in , the house on fire was the house i grew up in. 

i lived there till 4th grade. i had many memories in this place , my dog gigi is buried in the front yard , there was a shed in the backyard that served as my fort and the cherry blossom tree was my private helicopter. There was a side area in the back of the house were i smoked my first cigarette and saw my first set of boobies.

i feel weird for missing a house that i havent lived in for so long but i kinda always figured that it would always be there and now it is gone and to top it off Josh from Ameican Idol got voted off after i voted for him last night

"event","So yesterday i took part in the Halloween Critical Mass in SF. For those of you who dont know, it is kinda like a 'take back the night' but for cyclist.

Oh My Gawd , it was alot of fun. We started off near Pac Bell Park around 7pm. I would would guesstimate around 800 cyclist from all over the city were present to rage.  The actually ride was much different from what i expected, the ride itself was rather slow and the reaction from the squares on the street was some-what supportive. A few cars housed a random pissed off people but i most just smiled and honked there horn in our support... 

the ride i felt was a show of democracy at its best. Here we were a the brink of a peaceful protest trying to get our point across and having a good time as well.

i love san francisco

"event","So i have been having trouble sleeping lately, i guess i have been having this problem for the last two weeks , maybe more. I'm not sure what the problem is i have never experienced this before. This last year i have been having alot of issues with sleeping but not like this. I usually could fall asleep within five minutes of wanting to sleep and then i would wake up two or three times throughout the night. For the last two weeks i just havent been able to fall sleep. Alot has been on my mind and a toll is being takin. So i started taking sleep meds to help and so far it has.

But one of the benefits to being up so late is TV in bed. Last night i watched the O'Rielly Fact with Bill O'Rielly. Now i like Bill, i remenber him from Current Affair and Inside Edition and now i try to catch his new show from time to time. I agree with him maybe 70% of the time.But what i dont like about him is when he trys to intimidate a guest who is less intelligent and maybe nervous of being on his show. O'Rielly has the home field advantage, he controls the camera angles and microphone volume so it is not an even playing ground.

But last night he went up against my nigga Peter Jennings. Now i grew up in the generation of Peter Jennings, as long as i can remember he has been a dominate figure in the media world. When we were faced with the 9/11 crisis i took alot of comfort of seeing all my news coming through this man. If you want to talk about dedication , this man was on the air for almost two weeks straight and the world as well as myself would have it no other way. As he went from day to day to could see toll it was taken on him physically , you could see the burden of a million viewers placed on him and he gladly stepped up to the calling.

So last night as O'Reilly was starting in with his usually tactics of putting the guest on the defensive and trying to discredit the guest he met his match. The roles were reversed. O'Reilly asked ,who is better? Canada who is a socialist country or US the capitalist?  Peter being vary calm and collective was like come on bill is that the best you got... i dont know it was great just to see Bill got face to face with an equal in mind."

but tonight is friday and i am just gonna rest and try to get better... i am still in the process of getting my life back together and still have some people i need to see... i need to figure out where i am with bills, money and school and all that stuff...  i need a new cell phone cause mine has seen better days..she has served me well...and i really need to get back on a normal sleeping schedule and be able to get a proper night;s sleep...

no real plans for tonight , if you find yourself in the area please stop by or give a call... if not i will be calling you soon =)

"event","so i guess today is the real day that i made it back... i am still sick but i am starting to feel human agian and i think the worst of the illness is over... i am still stuck on a different time zone and because of it i have been awake since 3 this morning...i spent most of the morning surfing the net , checking email and started the dredded task of looking for a job =/ 
 
I did manage to leave the house for a little while but that was a big mistake... it took me four or five trys to leave but each time i would remenber i had forgotten something... its an odd feeling of carrying a cell phone and i have a special place in my heart for my phone... not to mention it took me 20 minutes to find out where i put my drivers liscense and i had to put all credit cards back into my wallet... now a wallet is a very strange element... now you girls just wont understand where i am going with this but bare with me....for us guys a wallet is sometimes the only organizer to keep our lives in order.. its where we keep the usual stuff like liscense, cc, blah blah blah and but it also the only spot to put something if we don't want to lose it... so we are really constricted to a very small space ... and then there is the matter of where goes.. well the back pocket right,,, which one?... i promise you that evey guy has a dominate pocket.. and its left or right...and if you put your wallet in the wrong pocket , it will through off your entire day...and i am willing to bet that if you did a study on guys ass's you will find physical evdience and which pocket he uses

anyways... so i left the house,,,and i wish i could say that i will never do it agian... it was weird.. i didn't know which pocket to put my wallet in so i just held it.. i didnt know what to do with my cell phone so once again i just held it ... i went to the store to buy a few things.. at first i felt odd being in a car and i was looking in all directions cause in bangkok they drive on the left or where ever they please.. then i went to the store and i was faced with what to buy.. i havent really bought actually food to cook in awhile and so i was dumbfounded...and so there i was in the store and i was cold and my toes where frozen and that was new to them and everryone spoke english but they were neither nice nor mean and i just didn't understand... and the bill came up to $35 US and seemed like alot for what i was getting... i dont think there was a day in thainland where i spent more than $35 US...unless i was shopping for gifts... and now i am home and afraid to go back out =(

oh my gawd, i hope this is valium making me feel this way!

time for a nap

"event","Greetings Friends

i wish to announce that i am back from my 40 day
getaway... i flew in two days ago (i think) and boy are
my arms tired..

its kinda weird being back , it feels alot like i never
really left.. my room is still kinda how i left it and
well i am kinda just picking up where i left off..
we'll sorta

i have been traveling hard since the 24rd.. i partyed
very hard on the full moon which was on the 23rd and
somehow i managed to make the ferry @ 11:30am the next
day, stopping the drinking ..um, who knows when..

i think sometime around the 24th i started doing the
countdown on when i would reach my bed... i started
with a four hour ferry ride and then a three hours
wait, and then a ten hour bus ride all of this
hungover.. followed by four hour nap and then ""one last
night in bangkok"" 

i hopped on a plane @ 3pm on the 26th and arrived in
SFO @ 6pm on the 26th... and then i had to wait about
two hours for a ride and then home... right , wrong
because my keys were at my sisters house and had to
spend the night at catherine's and veanne's.. so i had
to push my countdown to my bed out till the morning..
so i thought, but veanne went ahead and got a job so i
was stuck at the apartment until my sister came with my
car and once i dropped them off i was on my way home...
the time 4:15pm

but i have made it and now i am awake =(

but i am glad to be back and hope to see you all
soon... sorry i didn't make it to SS but i was feeling
like ass... Unfortunately i got the plague, it might as
well be malaria is feels like it... but hopefully i
will be up for hohners..what day is today anyways?

"event","Oh My GAWD... this trip has been noything short of a
dream .. and this place has something magical about
it... but where should i begin... so where to begin or how will this end... this will be my final post from thailand for tomorrow i get on a  plane and go back to the life i once knew.
 
screw you guys , i'm coming home

my name is joey.. what else is there you need to know?
Information about my friends or family and where i
am from? Well onced i crossed the ocean none of that
mattered to anyone but myself... i  guess you can say i was looking for something,what is was i dont really know.. maybe is was adventure , maybe it was somethnig
different and more exciting ... and yes i admit i was
looking for something a little more dangerous... what
i found, words can only begin to explain and what i learned , i wont even go there.. it wasnt all fun and
games and often times i second guessed myself... i have
never had to work so hard for a vacation... but i have never had a vacation work so hard for me...my only regret is that i didnt do this sooner...
 
screw you guys , i'm coming home...
 
kok pha ngan is something special... i have been told
that there is noything like it in the world and i believe this to be true.. but it wasnt all fun and games...
 
so what advice can i give you guys that are coming here.. i would start by cutting down on your internet
usage, this wil save you alot of money... also shop
around for your plane ticket, i over paid... brush up on your world geography, this will give you understanding with the people you meet... keep an open
 mind , this is not the US...and ""where are you from?"" is the greatest pick up line =)

screw you guys , i'm coming homw..
 
i remenber a line in a movie .. cant remenber the
movie but the line was, ""keep your body moving , or
someone will steal your shoes."" Look around my friends, do you still have your shoes on??? Where were you one year ago and where will you be in one year from today ?? is it the same spot with the same shoes?? just something to think about
 
screw you guys , i'm coming home
 
so they say america has no culture.. i say look
around.. it may be the most alive culture around... sure our history is alot shorter than most but look what we have accomplished in that time... the american dream is still alive, you see it in the faces of others who have only heard about america.. if i had one baht for every time someone refered to the states as ""america , the beautiful"" , i would only have about  fifty cent USD... but if i could put a price on how it made me feel i would be the richest man... when asked where you are from by a thai person , and i say america you can see them pause and respond, ' oh,,america' it really makes you think..

we have noything to complain about...everything is perfect in the states.. traffice , you have not seen traffic congestion.. smog from traffic,,, think again... homeless, atleast  homeless in the states can get food and have all there limbs.. thailand is still a developing country and right now it is willing to sell every natural resource to keep abreast with the rest of the world , including its women.. we have noything to complain 
 
screw you guys , i'm coming home
 
this trip reminds me of a poem written by robert
frost, tittled 'the road not taken'... in this poem
he talks about two paths that are not realy all that
different from each other but for some reason every
one chooses the same path... 
 
sure each path wil get you to where you want to go
but as he says one will make all the difference in the
world.. i guess there is no wrong way to live life,
we can get up each and every monring go to work , day
after day and say i have lived my life.. or you can
choose that different path and take it and i promise
you it will make a world of difference..
 
so i dont think that i have done anything that is different from what other travelers have been doing
for years..and i am sure my stories and experiences
are probably the same... we go the same places and see
the same stuff but it has made a world of difference
 
screw you guys i am coming home
 
so i feel like i am on the final esposide of Survior... as i walk down koa san road , i remenber the friends i made along the way... i remenber being like a child alone in the woods while i met jackie on my first day in the airport.. i remenber a thai man on a bus that translated thai to english for me and a bus driver... i remenber the GLOBE TROOTTERS and how we traveled togethere , had dinner and partyed as one... and how we had to say goob bye knowing that we may never see each other again...i love those guys...we were a family... we had challenges and we had the ups and downs... and now here i am feeling as if tomorrow as i go to the airport i will be going to tribal councel and state my case why i should be labeled  ""Survior""...

screw you guys , im coming home

i guess my case would go something like this,,,

so now the end is near
and so i face the final curtain
my friends , i say it clear 
i will state my case for which im certain..
to live a life thats full , 
i traveled each and every highway
but more much more that this

i did it my way

for what is a man
what has he got
if not himself
then he has not 
to say the things 
he truly feels and not the words
of one you yeilds
the record , i took the blows
and did it 
MY WAY (frank sintra)
 
screw you guys , im coming home
 
like i mentioned before you learn alot about yourself.. i learned that one of my greatest strengths
> is also one of my greatest weakness.. i am not going to say what it is, that information is for me... but will say this, we are all capable of so much more in life... a famous army solgan says "" be all that you can be"" well i say ""be all that you are"" , theres a difference , a big difference..  

and its not to late .. NOT EVEN NOON YET,,, right? Just because it is night time dosent mean the night is over...

screw you guys , im coming home

so i guess this brings me to the end.. i am going to rest up and meet with some friends from back in the states and tonight.. well one word ""ping pong""

tomrrow i arrive and the night after well we will see.. i do have a list of demands.. micheal i believe you promised a pizza also can you order the following movies? A bridge of the river kiwi, The beach and Aladdin .. veanne please turn my phone back on and make sure the battery is charged...everyone else , i am looking for a job so keep your ears out... and lets meet for a drink first chance we get

i am not sure what my plans are with my live journal.. being in  a foregin country i was really able to be honest and open but check back from time to time and see what is up..

oh and one more thing...

screw you guys , i am comin home"

"event","so , if you were there for my departure speech you heard the story about being the predator and being the pray... well at times i was each and the whole time i was running..

this is my last night on the island and the night off the full moon... i hear the systems full charged and the excitement is building... i will rage tonight under the moon... i will not try to relive my night i had one month ago but i will go with the flow and see what the night has in store for me and above all i WILL NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT

tomorrow will be another day of running, i have a bus ride out of dodge at one hour till noon... and i will arrive in bangkok at 6am the next morning..

spend one last night in bangkok and fly out in the moring... li - veanne has my flight information, if not let me know and i will resond...

so as the story goes, the predator must be faster and smarter than the slowest and less intelligent of the prey.. meanwhile the prey must be faster and more intelligent of the slowest / less intelligent of the predators and  no matter who you are you must keeep running or you die... so until then , i am off and running

"event","oh my gawd ....

so where to begin... so last night i thought was going to be a quiet night and planned to be in bed kinda early... we started by watching the new austin powers movie, 'goldmenber'... its alright i guess the first two are better... 

we headed down to the beach and bars around noon and got out bucket on...i taught our little crew a few drinking games and soon the real games begun.. i ended up dancing till... actually i am not sure what time i rolled into bed , the sun was coming up and the night was taken before i had a chance to take the night...

so today is my birthday and no real plans... tomorrow is the full moon party and i want to be rested for that...

yesturday evening was a day of lying in a hammock and when you sit you think...one thing you must do when you travel, espically when you travel alone is that you must think days ahead so that you are always prepared...you get in this zone, this way of thinking... you must think about wehre you are going and how you are going to get there and where you plan to go next... as soon as i got here i booked my bus ticket out... you must make sure that when you travel you have clean clothes to travel in and you have enought baht cause an atm might not be available right away... you make sure that if you eat that is wont pave the way to the worst bus ride of your life... 

so i have been thinking about what i am going to do when i return... i think now more than ever i am ready to make the move to the city... the time has come... Kat - laying me off was one of the greastest things anyone has done for me and since you took away my job can you help me find one =) So how is the job market currently? It is going to be weird coming back , i know this already... see you all in five days

alright i need to go... off to the beach..the weather is great and the beach is calling...

"event","so after another day of night traveling... i have finally arrived at kok phan ngan my oasis in thailand... this place feelings like home and i am being greeted as such...

as soon as i got off the truck taxi i was welcomed by my friends at cafe haitus... they came out and said 'hello friend welcome back' , i knew i was home... walking to the beach i saw the kind little lady who owned the massage parlor i would visit frequently she immeditally came out to say hello... i showed her my tattoo... while catching a nap on the beach the lady that sold me my hanna tatto came out to say hello and tried to sell me another... familar faces and familar feelings , ah it is good to be back...

its three in the 3 morning and i must get some sleep... Happy Birthday Li - best wishes to you... 

Here is a poem for you =)

dear larger
which art in barrels
hallowed be thy drink
thy will be drunk ( i will be drunk)
At home as in the tavern
Give us this day our foamy head
And forgive us our spillages
As we forgive those who spill against us
And lead us not to incarceration
But deliver us from hangovers
For thine is the beer
The bitter adn the lager
Forever and ever

Barmen

hope all is well and see you in 5 days =(

"event","oh my gawd....

where to begin, i guess at the beginning... so nathan and i hopped on a train going to bangkok.. i was rather tired and just wanted to sleep but we quickly met a traveler named Greg and a bottle of scotch... whoa

i am not the scotch type but i am also not the type to turn away a free drink... so we started to drink.. oh and i forgot to mention that i was sitting across from a monk... so we got drunk with a monk... he was this 60 year old monk who had been in the monk-hood-ship since he was 16... we tried to get him to drink but he would just smile and say 'no, you drink more'... actually we offered to be polite

we eventually had to move our little party to a diner car because people were starting to sleep and we were starting to drink... we had to walk 8 cars to the diner car with a bottle of scotch and drunk... while walking othere drunk travelers followed and soon the quiet littel cable car was a raging little party... 

train rides rule....

but now i am back on koa san road... this has been my san francisco for the past month and kok pha ngann has been my home cant wait to return...

"event","so it finaly happen... i finaly ate something that did agree with my stomach =/ Other travelers said it would happen and that it is just a part of traveling and no to fret..i was at a bar and said 'i dont feel well,i gotta go may not be back.' i dont thing is was something that was ill prepared just something that didnt agree, more in a minute

so last night was a night of shopping.. they have this night bazzar of all kinds of crap, alot of it being crap of course... but i bought a rathere large bag and went to town filling it.. night before i would check to see prices so that i would have an idea then i was off... 

so i bought some shirts and this morning i have learned the XL = small L = smaller and M= the smallest... dam these thai people for being so tiny.. i did get some really goo deals though...

the worst deal of the night came a little bit later... i ate this chaing mai pork basil something rather on rice... it was the shit and if it didnt give me the poops then i would go back today for more... i actually had it the night before and all was fine then but last night something was off... 

it sucked cause at three in da morning i had to walk to a store to buy some water and somewhere along the way i lost my key...i have stayed in many rooms and this was the only room that required a deposit for the key and this is the only room key i have losted , this feels odd to me

another thing that is odd to me is that everyone calls the bathroom, toilet. Toilet just sounds so crude to me. Restroom is a much nicer term and Bathroom is much more personable, i think at least... but anyways  , do you guys remenber the early movies and how they called them talkies because they had sound.. when i am trying to educate the thai population to called flushing toilet flushies, cause they flush.. i tell them its an american term.. and they go 'oh america'

sorry if the themne of this post is to much to handle but this was the themne for me last night... so i hope you guys have already had lunch...

i am off to go book a train ride back to bangkok and then a bus to kok pha ngan for the full moon party... i am sad to learn that sara and jackie will not be making it back to thailand =( but i am happy to hear that the 'the bastard , notorious RKH' has made an appearance and when i return we should get the band back together for one more gig...

i guess my trip has come complete circle... i have seen as much as i had time for and learned more then i ever imagined... i guess people travel for different reason.. some to sightsee and learn other cultures... i think i travel to people see.. sure i have see some nice wats (temples) but honestly , Wat-Schmat , you seen one you seen them all...but when you meet people out of there surroundings and away from there comfort zones you meet a different person and make a friend... i have learned that there are many , many types of white people in the world... and i learned that i talk with an accent to some..strange

alright , im off...

so i wenkkt to thisk club tonight called Bubbles... it was a nice little club , maybe the size of the usual but with a better layout.. it was several floors but only one sound system... i was feeling the groove and the drinks were flowing so i moved the kparty out into the dance floor... they played all trance and mixed in 80's love songs... they played really old trance music , kinda like the kstuff keith would play when he was a trancke dj.. wait , he still isk a trance dj @ heart =) so i kdont know what is up with kthis k key but it is not kme... the thingk thailand needs is a good networking person cause they have all these internet places but if the server goeks down nobody knows how to kfix it..

so kbubbleks.. it was a nice crowd...lots of thai women and these were not the working ones, so all was fair game =).. everyone kwas drunk and the music was loud...i couldk of stayed longer but the baht was running low and my friends were leaving... am now i am back at my mini mart needing to pee and still needing a drink...

okh today , was just a nice day of random kwalking around.., i got a kk, forget it this k ""k"" is getting to me , more later =)

i just got off of a 16 hour train ride and im rather tired... i met some nice people from london ... its weird cause jackie was talking about the packer ""good bye"" and today i think i understand what she was takling about.  its no more than just a good bye and sometime you dont even get that... i dont think of it as rude just a little weird and odd... you share a 16 hour train ride and talk on just about every subject and then to run off without saying a proper good bye... i just fill so used

okay i am off to bed to rest for tonight... micheal sorry our phone call was cut short but i guess you dont get very much for 300 baht these days... danny , i think i should of went to cambodia =)

i would guess the it had a draw of several 100 thousand people in a large park that was all lit up with christmas tree lights... i would guesstamate about 15 professional thearte quality stages with state of the art sound and lighting... meanwhile circling the park were hundreds and hundreds of kids on scooters causing a ruckus...

i have regained forces with sara and have add a new person to the gb list... his name is nathan and is an aussie.. the first aussie of the group...we are looking for jackie who has arrived some time this morning ... tomorrow jackie and sara leave for cambodia, they have asked me to go with and i still havent decided wether to go or not...

furrio where are you? last night when i was walking home , this dog started barking at me... teeth and all...i put my backpack over one shoulder to get ready to swing if he attacked... i was able to walk around but soon more dogs appeared.. three dogs block my street and wouldn;t allow me to pass... i had to redirect my way home and must have passed 12 or so barking dogs...

"event","hello all,

so after my long train ride and i had a day of just random walking and relaxtation... i found a room off the beaten path... noything special just a bed and its clean , clean enough... they dont allow night visitors which means i wont be getting any 5am wake up calls... i think my last visitor would have been trouble if i hadn;t woken up

so today i met up with some friends of veanne's named Stephen and cerrthwin. i had to meet them at a starbuck's in a mall called BMK... this in itself was an adventure... i was told by people at my guest house to find bus 15 and it would take me there... finding bus 15 wasnt easy , i think they failed to mention that i need a transfer or something... there is noything like the feeling of getting on a bus not sure where you are going , not sure how you will get back and not sure if the bus will get you there... worse case senerio i figure i will start waving american dollars and i am sure i will get to where i would want to be... but i made it 

so they took me to a place called JJ's which is a large , actually really large flea market... walked around for a while and then went back to BMK, i will return at some point to do some shopping... BMK is a seven story mall , its very impressive in size and inside its a nice cool temperture to chill in... they have a fast food chain here called ""Santa's Grill"", its the same fat man we have in the states... i have been craving fast food (drool) for awhile and when stephen mentioned santa's it sounded sweet.. proper french fries and a decent burger and cold pepsi. i think it was like 54 baht and i would have paid three times that... 

we have got  movie tickets to see 'forty days and forty nights' at the thearte on the seventh floor of this mall... Marcus & Jay -what is that game you play? Is it half-life? Here they have like two rooms with computers of people playing half-life.. one side for GI's and the other for terriosts... kinda neat...

i think we are going to watch muay thai kick boxing later tonight at a large stadium and maybe some more fast food... my pics have been developed so all i need to do is scan and send so give me one more day on that....

other that that i hope all is well and see you all in little over two weeks... veanne where are you?

skool (cheers in swedish)

oh and pic are on the way =)

so rob made me two cds for my travels and his special one has had 90% of the playing time... it was the perfect cd to sleep and chill to... its all very uplifting and soothing and its great for falling asleep to.... but sometimes the ABBA's dancing queen wakes me up... so thank you rob and i still want an movie clip with you flexing your pecs... and i hope it is okay but when i return to kok pha ngann i am going to give my friends at cafe hiatus your cd.... this cd was made for them...

today is where memories are made
and dreams really do come true
everthing i ever took for granted , 
i want to see it through

this time , this time
its fine however it is 

today is whatever i want it to be

Carpe Diem!

"event","have a seatt , this could take awhile...

so lets start with the beginging... i left Phuket at 7am in the moring yesturday , this is very early for someone of any time zones but i made it to the bus on time...its was good i left cause otherwise i may have got in trouble , the locals around my started to notice that i was alone and last night hookers would come to my door... i had three come to the door , the first time i anwered not knowing and the second time i said no boom boom and the third i said noything... but it was strange cause then i heard someone fumbling with the lock and thats when i yelled out hello and heard someone run off and the door swung an inch open... shit , shower and shaved and got the hell out...

so on a bus , actually a van at 7 , this driver was all pissy and being really rude to this smelly guy for being smelly... we drove to back to Krabi and i had to transfer and then to another place for another transfer and then another for my final transfer...each transfer 

each transfer , more white people got off and thai people would take there seats and carry on... i was headed to Kok Tantaro , this is where they are filming the next survivor... we first headed to Hat Yai , this is no longer Kanasas... i havent seen a white person for nearly 12 hours  and its kinda scary... the unwritten rule of the back packers to the learn what you can and pass on all information to the next packers... if a packers says dont go somewhere you inquire more,  if two saying it - think twice and if at third - then you dont go...

but here i am in Hat Yai... i am the only white person and i am not really white... Hat Yai is a large city , this place never seems to to lose my interest... i would say that scooters are to thai people as honda civics are to silcone valleys kids.. bascily we use then for anything  - to go camping  , haul shit around - move stuff , whatever ... well they use scooters the same... i saw one scooter hauling a 4*6 ply of sheet wood  on a scooter , with another person... you see lots of scooter , and its very comon to see two people on a scooter and you think 'alright.. then you see three people on a scooter and you think ' holy shit' , then every now and then you will see four on a scooter and you are ' oh my gawd , i cant still cant believe they do three' but my friends yesturday i saw FIVE on a scooter ... this i cant explain.. so the entire time driving thru Hat Yai i was just dropped jaw ... you would have like 20 kids walking to school in uniforms and a guy walking his bull behind then .....

so finally i got my final transfer , this was going to take my to Pak Bara which is the only launching pad to kok Tanturao and other islands.. did i mention that people are speaking less and less english and i am speaking more and more thai , you thought my spanish was bad....

so we are driving , and we approach a police road block.... i thought no big deal...we get pulled over and the cop looks inside and right at me ... millions of thought ran thru my mind...and earlier at the last transfer i went to the bathroom and when i came back my bag was put into the next van for me , very strange... so then i thought what if i have been set up or something , what if drugs have been placed in my bag and my story is the Fox's next big motion picture... so i was asked o get out of the van and asked for my passpost and askedd to see my bag... i was detained for about 15 minutes but 15 minutes to long if you asked me...they didnt search me or my bags but it was scary as hell

so now i am in Pak Bara , this is off the beaten track and i think i am foolish for being here... i spent most of the mornig trying to get to Kok Tantaro but i cant seem to find someone that will take me... looks like CBS did there homework , this island is a national park and is currently closed to all excpet them... they are here though people seem to know where they are...

so i am moving on ... this place is once again not for me , nobody speaks english and i am going to try to find the next bus out of here and head to bangkok... 

so i guess i am getting a little home sick.. i miss you guys... its funny cause when you are busy you are really busy but then there is also alot of down time when you just have time to think...i remember Brian's birthdaty a few years back and he said something like you have friends and then you have mates ... i think i now really understand what that really means , and i consider you guys mates (tear) i have really pulled some shit i my day and you guys have always been there ...

okay , but i miss you guys and home... i miss Catherine says ""schoosch"" , going to the gym with Veanne and getting all sweaty, i miss calling danny twenty-five cent & negro. i miss watching li point to his back and watching Caryn fall for it every time, everytime... i miss caryn and watching her dance when she eats...i miss Narcus says ""Jay OH"", and Jay for somereason i always picture him with a beer in his hand. i miss diane. tom and jaime , that sounds so much like tom & jerry - how the hell are you guys doning? Vlad , i miss vlad saying werd... Tasha , i just dont understand whats going on in the book you gave me , i think i need a pack of camel's... Erica i miss you too and thanks for the updates and i cant forgot Rob. i met this thia kick boxer that reminded me of you because he was flexing his pecks just like you were doing the other night at the brit , caryn was there.Veanne can you take an MP3 of rob flexing and put it on here? i miss micheal says' how are you doing mister luera or i ordered a pizza'. i miss furrio inching me off my own bed. i miss alex and jenny , you could always count on alex and jenny  being at hohners...Alex , i miss the chicken apple sausage... i miss red meat... oh an taco bell , i would kill for a proper bean burritio from taco bell... i miss hot water , and climate cools both indoors and in my car.. i miss fresh clean clothes and my bed ,,,, oh my bed , and comforter and pillows and TV....ah TV , i miss the simpson, whats homers up to...and GPXL what is being talked about these days??? the mouses here dont have scroll wheels , how did we survive with out then , Terry and Pauls how are you guys doing? Just Jer those pills give me nightmare =) Faruk i have met your twin....i even miss the little things like work and school.. i guess work isnt littel but i have done much of it the last three months so i guess it is little and school , kim i am ready for stats this quater =)

alright i gotta go catch a bus... i am goign to be traveling for the next 21 hours to bangkok... thats right i am headed back to where it all started....i am going to the heart of it all and this time i am ready , i am past the half way mark so it is now or never... this time will be differet , i met the face death , i have confronted the thai police and managed to avoid the temptation of phuket , so i think it is safe to say that im officailly 

THAI HARD 

alright , i want to here from everyone ,,,EVERYONE .... its going to be aleast 24 hours before i came back on line and i want to know what is going on back in the states ... i want to see who is on here and what i have been missings.. reply publicly or privately , its up to you...

alright gotta go and once again peace in the south-east

"event","so i ended up staying one more night @ Rei Ley... i really didnt want to leave and Yohan had more questions about american baseball and i wanted to teach him more so i stuck around one more night... 

so yesturday i arrived in Phuket and met a new friend named Tom... he is an english fellow and we have been hanging out.. this place is a little to much to handle so i will be leaving tomorrow... it is really expensive to drink last night we went to a go go bar and our bar tab came to almost 1000 baht and i only had three beers , here they add on for tax and tip.. not sure what the tax is for though.. so i havent taken any pictures of this place , it just dosent seem right , sorry guys 

i am really happy to have met Tom cause i dont want to be here alone being a single guy... this one street the girls come out and grab you and try to pull you into the club and Tom is just like me - he wants to look but not touch...

i think if you come to Thailand , this is something you should see once just for the experience but its not something you want to experience twice... 

Tom has a really nice room in a fancy hotel so today is just going to be a day of watching TV in his air con room.. we already watch Entrapment and Fireside started ten minutes ago... and i am out of here tomorrow

afterwards we went and go pissed and watched a thai cover band... finaly after three weeks i got some vodka... then my tattoo artist came and we shared a drink together

"event","well i first wanted to title this entry 'the scaryiest momment in my life' but then i thought twice about that title.. then i thought ' i shit you not' cause i dont think you will believe the story i am about to tell... so i decided on the current subject title so that i could project the positive than the negative... one thing i have learned is that whatever you have there is alot of people out there that has alot less... this dosent make you better or happier person ... just you learn that things arent as bad as they seem...

okay lets start from the beginning... well i am leaving tomorrow so one thing i wanted to do was to see 'the beach' from the movie  ' the beach' ... well the swedes wanted to get some sun so i had to go alone , no big deal... 

the island where the movie was filmed is called maya bay and is about a mile maybe two from the island kok phiphi... the island where maya bay is, is a national park and has no accomdations so you can only do day trips to there... 

so i tried to charter a speed boat but none of the boat operaters wanted to go cause they feared a storm was coming in... and i couldn't afford a larger boat for just me..

so mistake number one was i charted a small long boat.. it is mainly just a big wooden row boat with a engine strapped to the back of the boat... the engine is a size that would make Jashsh say 'ah yeah'....

so i will skip the detail of the ride there...so we couldn;t go into the actually bay because the weather was bad and a storm was coming in ... but we did park on the opposite side where we could walk thru the island to the 'the beach'...

well boats can only stay in the water and cant come to the shore because of the coral reefs ... so i had to swim 10 meters to the shore... this wasnt so bad i had a lifevest on and managed to make it to shore... we then had to walk barefoot on this coral cave to the trail that would take us to the beach... scary part one was when you walked thru this cave the water was up to you waist but they the tide would come in and you had to put your face as high as possible to the top as the water filled the cave...some times the water would receed quickly and other time panic would set in...

so i would say the ""the beach"" was less than epic... the guide i was with told me to go ahead and that he would chill under a tree.. so i walked as i approached the clearing i was feeling good and started to hear that Moby song playing in the back ground... but as i seted foot onto the beach the song was quickly mixed into some really bad song made only for a taco bell resturant... but it was pretty , a little dirty and less that epic but its okay

so we headed back... crossed thru the coral caves and did my swim to the boat.. all was well right , right , so i thought...

so it begun to rain... and then it rained harder , and harder,,,along with the rain came the wind .... the rain was no longer droplets but a steady pour of water from above...the sun had gone away and the wave grew to many meters high... the sea was angry that day my friends and the only thing more mad was the skipper of my vessel... it was the prefect strom but this time much like the first time it was just us all alone... 

at first i wasnt afraid , i could tell that the captain had been boating on these island for years and that he had salt watere for blood... i firgure that he is alteast 7 or 8th year generation of seamen and this was child's play for him... the boat we were in was probalbly the fine workmenship of his great fore fathers and that it has seen much worse from the ocean...  

but then ...

i looked down and saw that the boat was filling with water...the boats only draining system was a bucket that the skipper was using to shovel the water out...this is when i had to put panic aside and figure out what was to happend next... are boat was between the two island but the large waves were tossing us off course and pushing us out into the sea...

this  was time for action... i really didnt think this boat was going to make , i thought for sure we were going to flip and just my luck the life vest was in the back of the boat and i didnt dare try to stand of move to get it ... i put all my money in my pocket and detached my luggage nametag and put that in my pocket as well.. i remember just jer saying that i should buy three name tags for my luggage and one for my toe... 

and that was when it happened... i had a flash back of every person that every tried to teach me to swim... of every person that has told me that they had been a life guard one summer ... i remenber coline trying to teach me at PD's when i was really drunk... or keith another time when i was drunk... i remenbered narcus saying that he would let me drown when i was drunk in a pool.... songs about swimming came to mind , the innercense flyer popped in for a second , the time at the first cabin party when vlad stripped down to his boxers and came in the hot tub or being in the pool with catherine and veanne a few weeks ago... and faruk with his see thru short he would wear...but the one memory that really that stood above the rest was with Alex... it was this year at OODE and we went down to the river and alex was in the water and i was trying to go in but it was too cold ... alex said just run in ... then  he said ""c'mon , come to poppa "" with his arms wide open....

and at the momment , i was a swimmer... and not just a swimmer but a dam good one... i could of done , breast stroke , side stroke and even fancy diving... i was gonna make it with or with out the boat , i didnt need no stinkin' life vest... i had alex saying come to poppa and i was gona make it .... i was so pumped and i was even gona try to bring the boat with me... and until the boat reach the shore and until the momment my feet touch the sand 

i was a swimmer and it felt great

"event","Hello all and welcome Sharron...

So we are now down to four Globe trotters and soon i plan to break away from the pack... we left the rei ley yesturday for an island named kok phi phi... this place is beautiful even though the it has rained everyday... 

so it is now just me and the Swedws , Sarah , yohan and christine... last night we went out for dinner and we went to this swedish slash danish resturant.. i had a danish hot dog , noything special it dosnet measure on the same scale as the DAWGS in North Carolina but it was alright... afterwards we went to this place that had live music , it was this thai cover band that was singing green day songs (kim are you out there?) and afterwards we went to watch thai kick boxing... holy shit these guys really kick the shit out of each other , it was intense , we danced a little and then came the bucket , and then amother.. just our luck it was happy hour and buy one bucket get one free =)

so the funny thing is, is that i am learnign more swedish then thai... but it is all good , last night i taught yohan how to play baseball , he said the big sport in Sweden is field hockey and i said that it is a girl's sport.... i also told him about RED Rocket because we got a massage last night. i was still really sore from the rock climbing and they hit this one spot on the back of my leg and i screamed out really load and i had to explain myslef and i used the term red rocket.. li this is the place for you , sure veanne and caryn give great back rubs but there is something more to having a little thai person bounce on your back...

oh so speaking of moose burger , yohan was telling me last night that you can get a moose burger in his country...like i said i am learing alot about sweden...

so this island kok phi phi.. its alot like kok pha ngann... kok pha ngaan is the party island with all the energy focused around the full moon party so it has its peaks and then drops.. this place is just a fun place , lots of little shop and bars and lot more to do the K>P>N... i am thinking about diving 13 meters but still the fact of not being able to swim is holding me back =/ The diving guild says its not a problem but he isnt the one that cant swim... also i think i might go fishing today , i had barucada the other ngiht for dinner and oh my gawd it was so goood... i also watched the movie the beach a couple nights ago and that movie is excellent and right now i am livng the beach... but it is funny cause everwhere you go someone will come up and say 'guys i know of this beach , that is paradise , blah blah blah ' joking of cours but usually it sparks conversation...

and oh... the story of the little sparrow , well it has made it to an international country .. last night i told sarah the story of the little sparrow that didnt fly south for the winter , i wasnt that drunk so it only lasted about an hour... this moring i quized her on the morals and she got them right =)

alright my fingers hurt , 

one more thing... what happended in charolette, NC.... seriously what is going on in the world? and Tom can you do that thing that you always do for me (Techcu.com) ? and thanks for the comments it , i miss you guys... how was the Area 2 concert ? 

and 

happy birthday paula and happy birhtday jenny =)

alright take care and peace in the south-east

the last post so i had to come back to leave you on a
positive note if not only for you but for me as well
=)

SO some of you might know , but Heathere has alwasys
talked about buying a island, so heather i have found
the island you should buy... its off the shores of Rei
Ley near Krabi... this island is cool because you can
walk to it from the mainland and it only get chest
deep which would be great for your friends that cant
swim... like Veanne... its mainly just a large rock ,
that is really high up... a little beach area and
really just a large five story rock... its called
Happy Island by the locals... i figure you could carve
a hotel into the middle of it  and have like a little
diso on the very top it looks flat at least.. and
across from the island is the penis cave... this is
wear you bring a penis to offfer to the goddess of
fertility... maybe you could move the cave you your
island and people could bring you penises...

alright i feel better, i hope you do to =)

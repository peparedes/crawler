"event","i randomly saw some pictures this girl took at like a bithday party or whatever and she was having such a good time and she was surrounded by all of her friends,and they were just being...themselves? and i think im really missing that as of late. i know i probably sound so redundant but so what. When people come home from college things feel ""normal"" again..to me atleast...and thats a really great feeling to me because i guess thats just what im used to?
I was thinking about the early days of high school(again) when all of us said we dont care about what people say, and when i thought i knew who i was,and when a huge sleepover was the highlight of my weekend... i remember when me julia and nina were really close, we would alternate houses every weekend haha.  Sharing rides to movies...my mom would never want to take us but i always asked her anyways...
then people change. for the better? i dunno.....maybe i changed and everyone else stayed the same. for the better? i dunno.
cuz now...now its about the drinking and the sex and for some people the drugs..and i do care what people think and i dont know who i am..now i drive to movies, and we ""dont do"" sleepovers..only when its to crash after drinking cuz i cant go home.

im just feeling like i fucked up (as usual) and i let my parents down...in turn let myself down.
Im stubborn, thats what my problem is..i thought i had everything under control...what an idiot i am...ill live it down though....i have to prove something to myself

____________________________________________________________________________________

on a brighter note i found out Karrie gets paid more than me and if i remember correctly i think she just started like 3 weeks ago?!
What the fuck do i have something on my ass that says ""will work for less"" ?
For serious now.
but there have been some pretty funny people that come in..

OldLady: is that soft cheese?
me:ummm its fresh? if thats what you mean?
OldLady:no! is it SOFT cheese.
me: no, but i can heat it up for you?
OldLady: *walks out of the store*
...later i realized what the hell she meant she wanted like speadable cheese like brie or some shit....
NEWSFLASH: ITS SUBWAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!

Pittsfordlady: mmmmmk im gonna need 2 subs
me: aright, what kinda of breads are they on?
pittsfodlady: wheat
me: Oh, im sorry we dont have any wheat right now its still baking
pittsfordlady:..oh...well how long till its done?
me: about 30 mins
pittsfordlady: *walks out of store*

HAHAHAHAHHA some people i just dont understand... just get a different kind of bread dont let it ruin ur day?

that whole wheat and ""soft cheese"" really does get to people"

       Turns out I cant go, I thought it was the 3rd...ill be in Hartford
11/8- Tacking Back Sunday
       I really wanna go...any takers?


Anyways...looking for a job is a job within itself and im really getting frustrated.
On tuesday I had an interveiw at the gap, it went really well, really really well.  But i had to come back for a second one tonite, and it was a group interveiw (not fun). 6 of us sat in a little circle and he asked all of us the same question but theres really only one answer to these tideous questions, so basically everyone was repeating the same thing over and over.  Seems ironc because the company is supposed to be all about being personable with their customers, and there was definatly a lack of one on one.  I left the interveiw pessimistic because I really dont think it went very well, but ill know if i got the job by this weekend.

I have to get my stiches out from my wisdom teeth wounds on friday, that should be fun.
I can eat most things now. Just sore.

My parents keep asking me what I want to do with my life
but what kind of question is that, really?...i get so mad when they ask me that
Im 18 years young, and I dont really give a shit if Im sitting around doing nothing right now. RIGHT NOW being the key words....
There are college visits lined up
I have an art portfolio that was completed last year
I have been looking for a job and had an interveiw all in one week
Im taking a class @ MCC

"event","so Tom left this morning..he was supposed to leave last night but to our surprise his flight was delayed :) so we had to change it to today so i got an extra night with him!!! yay!!! <3

NEWS: i got my license today!!!!!! woot 3rd try:)
My parents acually let me go out tonight too...but this whole be home by 10 thing is suck ass.  Nobody i know has to be home at 10....that should be my cerfew when i was in what? 8th grade? when will i ever be given the chance to grow up?
my parents are so contradicting...i dont even want to get into it because it just makes me mad.  But for an example tonight i was allowed to stay out until 10:30(with my ""freedom"") ok...i got home at like 10:37, my dad got mad at me,i try to go change in my room (which i share) turn on the light, i get yelled at for, wtf am i supposed to do? and my parents suspect i smoke pot still...its like every day, ""are ur eyes red""..""it looks like u burned ur lip""...OMG no! SHUt uP! i knew id regret telling them about my problems.
I need to go back on happy pills i think....ugh no maybe not, i think the answer is moving out not pills, im so happy when im not home, then when i come home everything just sucks again....every little thing i get yelled at....why didnt you feed the cat, why is ur room so messy, why didnt u take out the garbage an hour ago...like it would matter if i did it an hour ago....just every litle stupid thing

"event","I was gonna write about the Darien Lake/DMB concert yesterday but they day kinda just slipped away, so here it is....IT WAS AWESOME!! I went with KT,Julia and HIllary. 
1st of all i hate metal detectors, as we are entering the park i go through the metal detector and it goes off, they look through my purse then we figure out its my belt haha Im like you want me to take it off?? lol
2nd It was so hot we all felt like we were gonna pass out. 
we rode the good rides like superman(SCARY!)and couldnt afford any food so we didnt eat all day, but it was still fun!
Later... Me and Julia had lawn seats for the concert so we had to split up with KT and Hillary, but i think i like lawn so much better than undercover everybody is so crazy and nice haha probaby because they are stoned/Drunk.  This guy Julia works with was talking to us and we hung out with him basically the whole concert, he was pretty cool....we got this drunk girl to buy us drinks. shes like NO PROBLEM hahaha...that was like everybody's attitude ,you bump into someone and their like ""Hey, NO pROBLEM!"" even when this girl burned me with her cigarette i was like ""NO PROBLEM!"" haha.  It was aLot of fun i wanna go again. 
The suckist part of the whole day(which wasnt that sucky) was probably the hour wait in the parking lot at the end of the concert, but i got to see some naked guy and we harrassed a pizza man.  We also played the ABC game lolol Apple,Boat,...umm KT...do u remember anymore?!?! haha

Things are looking up, i think i will be able to see Tom and i think i have the school and job thing more figured out...it just takes time i guess."

"event","2nite was pretty fun even though we all have the same problem everytime we go out....what should we do?  We were gonna stop by this party but there wasnt anything going on so then we hung out at 12 corners aka UNITY cuz we are all so ""united"" in BRIGHTON, fucking town...
When im out with my friends i forget about how shitty things are in real life, there are pros and cons to this feeling.....
PROS
-im away from my parents
-dont have to think about school
-get some good laughs in
CONS
-i need to deal with school
-i need to get a job
-i have to stop spending money

It really sucks that my general attitude towards everything is ""it doesnt matter.""  But thats really how i feel.  I think im depressed again, and if my parents dont let me go see Tom in august i think i just might lose it.  I already feel like our relationship is falling apart and today i was thinking about how i dont really want a boyfriend, i cant even deal with myself right now, so i have to worry about two people?  Its getting overwhelming.  I know i need him in my life though, he really helps me stay sane.  I developed pictures of when i saw him last, and i wanted to cry because i couldnt believe i even thought of not wanting him around.  
SIDE NOTE TO TOM:
im sorry.  Im just really frustrated right now, ill get over it.  You just have to understand that right now i NEED you around to talk to, its hard enough we live so far apart,and its not that i dont want you to have friends or anything like that. Its because i need someone to talk to, there are sooooo many different things going on in my life right now and talking to myself on this journal doesnt always cut it.  I Love You So Very Much.  
I just miss you....."

"event","The days arent getting any better, they just keep getting more intense, worse fights with my parents about how i dont have a job and how i need to get one.  This morning my dad was being lovely and was telling me how proud he is of me barely graduating high school.That was swell dad Thanks...and then later his exact words were ""you fucking annoy me""  AWWW Well i love you too!!  
Im tring to find a job but not tring hard enough according to my parents,they are now punishing me for not having a job. (Even though i dont have a car or a lisence)  I dont know if i can go see Tom now in august, i was gonna go there for a week since i wont see him and barely talk to him  for the two weeks im going to be away in Hawaii.  they dont understand how i need to be able to see him,and how i need to be able to get away from this house.  When im with him its so relaxing not getting yelled everyday and being able to be with my best friend/boyfriend.
They want me to know everything and have it all figured out, whens the time for me to be a teenager? they want me to have my life figured out before i do anything fun.  They always give me too little resposibility or way to much. Cant we find a happy medium?"

move over norm abram.

my new motivation for working at the coffee shop is to attain a plethora of wood working tools. 
our new house, in the backyard, my dad and i (mainly just me) are gonna build a shed. i'm basically gonna take it over and make it my shop. it's gonna be 18x15 feet, should be big enough for gettin some cool stuff built.

"event","don't you hate it when you make plans with someone and then it's suddenly not convenient for them and they just flat out don't call, and when they do call, it's suddenly like they have nothing to do and you're their last resort.

"event","this had to have been the best weekend i've had in a while.

it started on friday afternoon at 2 when i got home from school. i packed my things and loaded the car. went to pick up Andy and we were on our way. we drove up to silver city to vidit his dad and go do some mountain biking. we watched boondock saints that evening. on saturday, we got up and rode the local trails. lots of fun, there are trees there. after that, we got back to gis dads and rode around the town for a while, the next day, we went to the local bike shop and this guy gave us a tour of the trails in the old mining area. you could accually ride down into and around this one mine.

got home at about 6 on sunday, Carlito called me and gave me some tickets he won off the radio. i called Crystal and we went. social distortion is pretty damn cool. after that, we went to VI and had coffee with Alexis and Lauren.

good times."

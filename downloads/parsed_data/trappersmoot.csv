"event","Blazes and Firey Pitchforks!!  I learnt my lucky snakeskin pocket was full of pebbles, not a penny to be had!  What'll I tell that oval-shaped, theivin noser in Ravenall when I try and get  my Bonny back.  Bonny is the best horse a fursman could ask for.  She's twenty times loyaller than one of them cheap pokes in town!"

"event","I went down by the ol' cabin in Buffalo.  All the boys were there old One Eye, Bearcane, Gangreen Grierd, wiley Scotston, Birdie the trapper from way back in Virginny and that crooked fur-nabbin Paulsen, both of which I ne'er would met again if I hadn't been tailin those injuns who stole my Bonny.  I hadn't seen them fellas since the snow in in Maine!!  Paulsen's got a full man's beard these years and Birdie's going a trifle loony, precisely why he's beena bird e'er since way back though his God-given's really Bertram. 

it was a god ol' time even though I reckon Paulsen's got his eye on my new rabbit liners and I'm afearing Birdie an' Scotston'll be lookin' to head t'wards westerly Detriot or Cinci with me to see bout my son, after of course I go fetch Bonny from them red-bottomed bumploes!  Which I have a full mind to do, Just may be a time before I can an' I might need some help if they don't see to lookin' fer a fur change, I may need t'pull some wiles and bag their eyes before they can grab their tommehawks!"

"event","Tarnation!  I discovered to day I had juss two days worth of meat left.  I been a lazy Cliff all this week and I'm ashamed to admit it.  I feared that pack of beavers wouldinna last as long as I had chanced.  If I happen on a dying chipmunk I'go for him.  The sun's fallin and I best get to proppin a shelter for these old creaky bones.  What I'd give for a warm washtub and some grits....  Not to mention the companionship of a pretty miss to poke!"

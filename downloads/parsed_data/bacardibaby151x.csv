"event","so i just got back walking from the back of the purple parking lot. a good 20 min walk, in the dark, on sheer ice. And not to forget the big possibility of gettin jumped/raped/killed or whatever other things creeps are doing these days to girls at umass. even the cops dont care about us. id be in the middle fo a crosswalk, a cop will be sittin RIGHT THERE partolling cars, a car will fly thru the crosswalk, almost HIT ME..and the cop will just stay sitting there.....fucking bullshit. but then if someones doin 5 over the speed limit, theyll get a ticket. i hate how i hafta go to crazy measures everyday just to get my car/get food..the showers are filthy, they dont salt the sidewalks, the classes meet 4 times a week each/.i spend more time chasin down a bus/walkin to class than i do in class. 

umass has been a total ripoff. i feel completely cheated out of the college experience. it didnt help they threw me into SYLVAN for my 1st semester...and even after i fought and fought to get to southwest, i ended up ina basement w/ totally antisocial students..in fact, their so anti social that ive never even seen one of them. its so bizarre.

sometimes i get disappointed in my friendz here.dont get me wrong i know alot of people, but im not close to any.  i mean we have fun chilln. but thats all.

parties are another story, especially the frats. they require everyone to pay $5 to drink their pabts blue ribbon shit beer..when their ugly as SIN.just cuz they wear ralph lauren doesnt make me want them ANYmore than if they were wearing torn up muscle shirts. helloo..do they know who i am???! THEY should be paying **ME** to even set FOOT thru their door. (not to sound cocky or anythin lol)..but this is MY journal and i can write whatever the fuck i want.so, if that happenz, ill call him an asshole to his ugly face and L-E-A-V-E.

sometimez i feel like theres something wrong w/ me sometimes..like trust issues..i feel like everyones tryna pull one over on me. i have a really hard time getting close to people..IM ALWAYS watching FOR SOMEONE TO TRY TO SCREW ME OVER. cuz i know they will if i let my guard down they WILL.

so ima lil sad i cant drink tomorrow..i was readin online about my meds and i cant drink til FRIDAY. im gonna have a mental breakdown. lol/.ALCOHOLALCOHOLALCOHOL.tonite at ""history review' i shared w/ everyone something i never thought id tell anyone..it was weird goin alone..

so im sittin here wishin i could be cuddling..lol..or RAPED..id LOVE to be raped..only by certain guy (he knows who he is) of course not any nasty ass guy.( so nasty ass guys i dont know dont get any ideas) i wanna be choked, tied down, called a dirty slut, 
have my mouth taped, and be shoved around..it turns me on sooo much! i was talkin to this friend a lil while ago @ a party who was offering me some drunken advice. he said i dont really wanna be raped..its just what i consider the norm. in a way i guess hes right. i dont really know what itd feel like to just make sweet love to someone. usually i just lay there.its the whole powerless feeling i need to feel like a victim..lol..if that makes any sense. )..and i already know i am a pretty crazy mothafucka.anyone  wholl be drunk, go up to cops and just shoot the shit while watchin the sox is nuts. but i <3 me.
most girls are too scared to be themselves. so they go out, buy diamond stud earrings, polo shirts,eskimo coats, tight jeans, and ugly UGG boots.( dont even get me STARTED on these ""Ugg"" boots..) not to mention caking the makeup on. then they go around, gossip and whore themselves out...im not mentioning any names but **coughcough....all freshman who live in the towers** should go to hell."

"event","ok so...i hate men..they SUCK....sometimes i dont even understand why there are men, even though i couldnt survive without them. im so sick of the men around here..their all dumbass short ugly fucks(haha vanessa i stole ur word) w/ no muscles..no body...nothing.pale too..they wear fucking a&f and polo and think ther'yre all of a sudden hott and hard to get cuz they got the ""frat boy"" look..fucking popped collars..ugh.

men are so emotionless and cold. they're willing to use women for their bodies with no strings attached..when u want a relationshp, they want a ""friendship (w/ benefits of course) eww..but when u wanna just be friends..theyre all tryin to ""get wit chu"" and get mad when u tell them you only consider them a friend...they get offended that u arent attracted to them.even though they wouldnt want a gf anyways..and they think were the confusing ones!!

they get mad when women use them for money (getting free dinners or whatnot), call them 'golddiggas"" but the only reason they were taking you to dinner in the first place was to try and get a piece/ then ditch u... so..women, take your free dinners and LEEEEAVE!!!!


i hate when my male friends complain to me that their single and lonely..but yet they go out to the club only to find ""hot girls"" and ""sex"". of COURSE you're gonna be single and lonely...maybe if u look deeper into who a woman actually is and what shes looking for youd find more satisfaction...i dont feel bad for men like that at ALL....they deserve to be *slapped* =)

i also hate when a guy playes games..for example..when ur single and looking for someone descent, and the guy u wanna be with says something like' im so lonely..im looking for a girl..then shows hes into you..but then says shit like ""do u have any friends that are like you that u could hook me up with?""..i KNOW the head games you guys play so dont even try me..you all think women are ""crazy"" and psycho when in reality were the ones with real emotions that actually CARE.we just like spending time with you and whispering sweet things in your ear, cuddling, just bein there for you..maybe goin out to a ROMANTIC dinner..but u all make it so goddamn hard. us women hafta worry all the time about head games, fake guys,and getting hurt. men dont even get hurt over a girl. theyre all players. theyll maybe cry for 5 mins then move onto the next one."

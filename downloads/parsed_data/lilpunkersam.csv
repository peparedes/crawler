If i could be god for a day 

I would  end world hunger and poverty..make everyone equal no poorer no richer jsut equal

I would  find a cure for all cancers, no child  shall die before their time or undergoe such treatments that it stunts their growth

I would clean all the oceans and  water so it is safe for al to drink,there for  get rid of maleria and  water born diseases."

"event","I have a dilema...
  I kinda slept with an ex b/f  after drinking a little bit too much...
 He is the guy  I have compared all my b/fs too.. and I do admit I still have feelings for .. so then today he asked me out  again.
The delima is  should I or not?? I told him yesa.. I mean this is the guy  I want to end up with  he is the father of Lily so it should work.. but  do  I set my self up for failure again. we have tried  before and  failed so I dont' know.  We  live in seperete cities and he is not willing  to relocate and neither am  I seeing as I  got into the program I want at school. So the life  question is  do I try again and make it work and finally get the perfect family I want??

On another note I start my job soon .. yay daycare!!!"

Mind you Lily can count to 10 and sing her ABC's aong with partialyl spelling her name. BUt what if Unversity is too hard oh well there are lots of ppl that support me or at least I hope there are

"event","well i went away to Nunavut on the 13th - 17th !~!!! It was faboulous and cold!! I learned a word Nahkume said how it is spelled it means thank you in Inutkuk or however u spell it. Anyways I  have lots of pics surprigly none have tress as the city was without them which made things kinda odd.. I  did a conference helped train young youth aged 15-19 on Anti smoking and anti tobacco. But i met them and some of them were kinda crazy i guess being couped up in the top of the world does that to people. I told everyone my stories if you want to hear more either send me a comment or talk to personally for those that live close. Anyways I have like 3 wks of class left and i am kinda stressin i guess i should be doing work but i am too lazy to do any. Sigh meh any ways i am sitting in the open access area and well i dont' know where all my friends went to since we have a 2 hr break they all left, maybe next Monday i won't come since threre is no point i will jsut do what ihave to on that day. ANyways back to my trip, i didn't see any polar bears but i did  hear Throat singing and lots of snow and one bird a raven they were all over  the place. For those of you that don't know Nunavut only has about 10000 ppl and int he city i was in only about 6 thousand ppl and one main road Called ""RIng Road"" the rest of the territory is spread out and each community is only accessible by Plane.  well that's all for now i guess i should spell check this since it annoys Jen :P"

I just found out I am the maid of honour and my daughter is the flower girl .. mind you Lily can't walk yet or  talk either!! But I was flattered when she asked me..I was like what am I going to wear????? THe first issue is that when we were living together we never really got along like (no offense Joe) but when her current love intreast wasn't around or mine wasn't we were ok  we talked and such. Tina was the first to know I was pregrnant she was there through all my ups and downs and the only reason I ever moved in with her was cuz we both hated our current roomates mine was a drug addict and hers was a bitch!! Kinda confusing but now we are good friends and I am her freaken MAID of Honour!!!! Anyways my boyfriends sister is getting married in 2 months and she is havign a huge like 200 person wedding I wasn't invited cuz of Lily but I have to be in the pictures since Lily is her neice. So all this weddign stuff is kinda freaking me out because if I count all the time I have been with my boyfriend it equals up to 2 years 4 days......... but right now it is 4 days and I keep teasing him about life and such. He refuses to get married and such but last night I told him by the time I am late 30's we better be married,house car and jobs... I thought it sounded good he kinda agrees but seriously I wish all this wedding stuff would be over with so I can go back to not talking about it ....Wedding showers weddings and new baby's is what my life has come to .wow I never thought my 20's would be like this at least my best friend won't get married she told her man he has to have a house and job before he even thinks of proposing although her 18 year old sister was supposed to get married....

"event","well last night around 2:00am i was in some serious pain. It appereared to be contractions yes the ultimate LABOUR so lovely eric freaks out and wakes my mom up which in turn makes her freak out. We drove to the damm hospital me sayinh it wa pointless the entire time by the way the drive is 25 mins long across town which isn't great when every bump makes you wanna cry. i got hooked up to machines and Eric was amazed by them too it is around 4 am at thsi point . After waiting we get sent to the waiting area, Damm security and theri Tatics!! THey kick out my dad and Eric!!! So me and my mom wait for my doctor for like another 20 mins gettign more annoyed by the minute!! The doctor looked at me asked questions atold me it was false labour and  bladder infection combined oh yeah tons of fun!!
So anyways that was my  lovely night hey Tina hope yours was better!!
I hate hospitals and sadly one mroe thing Eric leaves tommrow leaving poor me all by myself who knows when i will see him again.........
So anyways i shall be off to spend my last night with Eric 
Have a nice  night people"

"event","Well today  i almsot lost my best friend, no it wasn't due to aifhgt or argument it was due to a car crash.
I got the phone call everyone never wants to get... in a serious car crash sitting in the emergency department at the hospital.
I lied to the doctors and said i was her sis although  i consider myself one anyways... but the fact is i seen her and it didn't click in what had actually happened until she told me the details and i talked to ehr boyfriend who was aslo badly injured
Sideswiped by a freaken transport truck grrr drinvg her boyfriend to work!! The thing is the other guy wasn't hurt his vechile wasn't damaged of course not it was a transport~!
I went to the mall after leavign the hospital which i felt bad about doing but it was to buy a present for her and to talk to my friend about the accident... The three of us stick together and this is jsut gonna pull us even closer i hope no way will i not show up at the hospital tommrow with a grin and fake nto being worried. Ia m worried but also relieved that  she onyl got the imjuries she ddi, i am thankful it was  on his side and not hers if it was hers well then this would be a different story now wouldn't it?
I cried for over half an hour tonight Steph.. I never realized hwo much i took u for granted before... From now on Steph no matter what i'll be there... no more fights about guys ro anything jsut friends till the end and the end better be 70 Years from now!!"

"event","Well today i am stuck inside due to renovations..Dammit since when was I the babysitter for the painter?
Anyways it is 3 weeks today since I moved back home and left the Shwa......There are some things I miss there mainly my boyfriend Eric...
I was talking to BIll today yet another ex..He  still  apparently wants to go out with me but like I said I have a boyfriend back in Oshawa who I am madly in love with.. Bill gets me angry sometimes , always asking me annoying question,but hey he has also been a good friend also. 
I didn't get to talk to Eric yesterday, cuz i was out shopping and getting groceries. Hopefully he calls today or maybe tommorow.....
Well i guess that's all for now I don't know what I am gonna do the rest of the day maybe go watch paint dry.."

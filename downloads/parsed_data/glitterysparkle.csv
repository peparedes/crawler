"event","oh mannn... today in history is was like funnn cos audrey tan was teaching and suddenly she was staring out of the window like she saw adolf hitler standing naked outside or something. Then she said,"" girls sorry im distracted"" and then we were looking at each other like 'hell yeah' and it turns out she was looking at some bird that was like gynormous and it had wings like bats and a beak with a green body and we were saying it looked like a peredactol or some wierd dinosaur and we were all standing on the tables. then she called all her guides to come and identify it and soon she was running to the staff room to get... her BIRD camera?! i mean He-llooo? and she came back with some seriously big camera that had like a 1 metre long focus lense! and started taking pictures and then she said that we were distracted and went back to the history lesson and we were all still looking at the bird so she closed the curtains and we were all trying to peep through the hole and so she was all ""focus girls focus!"" and we all were saying ""its flying away!"" ""what if it evolves"" and ""its laying an egg!!!"" and then she didnt believe us [who would] but i think it was super funny.

Then we went down this hill and we were just gonna start running when this brown freeky dicky dog came out. then dee got so scared and she was like ""okok... dont run just walk"" and then the dog started following us and we got so freaked out that we started running for our lives and then the dog kept on following us so we ran past the house with the two dogs and they started barking and running along the fence trying to chase us and i promise if they wanted to they could jump over the fence. so we started running again and the brown followed us and dee really was freaking out. so we looked back and the dog was still there then it stopped at a car and then we ran and tried to hide. so then we kept on running until we couldnt see the damn dog anymore. before we saw the dog we saw lky's sister and she was like talking to us and she was kinda irritating saying that why did we start our diet so late and all this crap and her daughter was having menopause... and all this shit... ok... gtg"

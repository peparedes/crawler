hailfax played good. i dont really like there new stuff. 

bno played good, but they were on a small stage and it was way to crowed. 

some metalcore on the battle of the bands stage was sick. nothing but breakdowns it was fun. 

the bled was real fun. some kid got masacred by some scummy scenesters. it was intense yet funny. 

underoath played the best set. they played so much better than at hellfest i got up on stage sang for a bit a tired a backflip off the stage. it almost worked. i might go to see them today with tbs at vintage.

1. Never argue with an idiot, he'll drag you down to his level and beat you with stupidity 
Never argue with me, I'll drag you down to my level and beat you with a fucking bat 


2. Real Men of Genius. Today we salute you, Mr. Compulsive Away Message Checker. While most people are out actually having a fun life, you are at home reading about it on your computer screen. Right mouse click, Get Buddy Info, or the little Info box at the bottom of the Buddy List. You have people on that list you haven't talked to in years, but you still loyally read their away messages every day to see what they're up to. So, crack open an ice cold Bud Light, Marauder of the Mousepad, and don't wonder too far from your computer because you never know when someone's away message may change.


3. |B|L|O|W|J|O|B|S| My Anti-Drug


4. I've fallen out of my chair, this could take a while


5. The funniest thing about this away is that by the time you realize it doesnt say anything, its too late for you to stop reading it, dumb fuck


6. Just tell nemo you couldn't find him because you were getting stone, He'll understand


7. If: 
A B C D E F G H I J. K. L. M. N. O. P. Q. R. S. T. U. V. W. X. Y. Z. = 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26. 

Then: 

H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K 
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98% 

and 
K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E 
11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96% 

But, 
A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E 
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100% 

And, 
B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T 
2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103% 

AND, look how far ass kissing will take you. 
A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118% 

So, one can conclude with mathematical certainty that While Hard work and Knowledge will get you close, and Attitude will get you there, it's the BullshiT and Ass kissing that will put you over the top. 
From a strictly mathematical view...


8.roses are red 
pickles are green 
I like ur legs 
and whats in between!!

9. Sex is good,
Sex is fine,
Doggy style or 69
Just for fun or getting paid,
Everyone likes getting laid!

10. Today your secret crush will fall in love with you. You will win the lottery, and will be named the sexiest person in the world... If you haven't noticed, this away message is full of shit - much like my toilet. BrB

"event","So Yesterday was a total fucking drag.  I woke up at 6pm, so i wasnt able to call chevy about a job.  and if wha gantt told me is true, then i have nothing to worry about because zach (or zack, idk) was too busy with gantt all day, which give me a little hope for today.  I haven't slept yet, and i'm tired as all hell, but i cant sleep because of whats on my mind.  What else happened today.  Oh yea, i talked to ashley graves today (an ex that has nothing against me...ldd, isn't it?)  and she made me feel a little bit better and the way that she did that was by givin me the feeling that she has nothing against me...which brings a slight smile on my face..oh yea..im glad that i didnt join the fuckin military, although i still want to, and the reason being i because it's only been 2 days of not seeing kat and i miss her terribly, so imagine 4 years or so..yea, exactly..hahaha

Um, what else is there, I guess im going to update this thing a lot so i guess it's time that i add friends..hell, i might even get comments, and a couple of friends back...so why not give it a shot"

Eternal slumber
PITCH BLACK
Everything is quiet
Begin the decent
Darkness elevates
Eyes blinded
Choking
Darkened water all over
Can't see
No breathe
Take my life away
Theres nothing left
I'm alone
No one else
Silence
Loneliness
The air thick
with darkness
Lungs constricted
Clouded thoughts
Shrouded dreams
No light shines through
Sit still
breathe nothing
feel nothing
lie down
sleep

consider me misery
in unknown colours i will paint your portrait
consider me beautiful

I will forever mourn our last minutes together
the times when we were we
and all the hours we spent together
and all the more hours thinking of eachother
where is your loyalty now?

Now that the times have passed
and your words are nothing but echoes in my hollow chest
And your siren song doesn't effect me anymore
Where will you turn to now?

There's nothing left in this world for me
Nothing left in this paradise formally known as us
So I will pack my bags and leave this little town
And move into a place called......?"

let the numbness flow through your veins
This will be the last time we depart
The final dosage of our pain

Do you feel the regret yet?
Our hearts torn away so quickly
Has your mind been numb with regret?
Abusing and misusing my heart so uniquely?

There's no pain left for me to endure anymore
This is the end of our struggle together
Has this relationship really been that much of a bore?
Whatever happened to us being us forever?

So for the next few days, our death i will mourn
As you laugh your way through this torture
My soul is detached, tattered and torn
And forever, these wounds I will nurture"

hallucinations surround me
my system begins to fail
youre to blame, the reason for my sacrifice
so i start with this knife...drag it across my throat
for you..for our love...theres no need for my survival
i've lived my life for you, and you've had your fill of me
so this shall be my end, nothing else will fit better

your silouette fills my mind
nothing but your smell fills my nostrils
i reach for your hand, but its taken by his
im left alone, lost for air, gasping for breath
you were my oxygen, my life source, my everything
and you took it all and ran, leaving me empty...hollow...a mere shell

I scream for your name, but your ears are all for him
nothing left for me, you took it all and ran
so i stand here, gasping final breathes
as i drag the knife across my throat...

I scream for your name again
choking, gasping, spitting out blood
grotesque images fill my mind now
Of him touching you...My holy temple
Now besmirched with his vile oils, and scent 
you may scream his name at night, as i try to scream yours
but i will never scream another name again...

the darkness will forever loom in me
the rage in my mind will only be down in words
i can never harm you, I will never harm again
you will be my last.....mistake"

it seems only like yesterday when you took my whole heart away and hid it away form me on the highest shelf
now you want me back again and im just lost again i still dont know what to do
should i go through the pain again and live through all this strain again just so that i could love you?
or should i lay beneath the clouds and ponder what i used to think aloud do you really love me so?
i dont know what to think of this, i want to make an end of this, but i love you too much.
and now the things that haunted me are well alive and bothering me, which way should i turn?
should i face the problem head on with my mind straight on, or bullshit all the way?
or should i leave you alone, stay deep in my hole, and let all my thoughts astray?
i left you once, you left me once and now im lost in empty thoughts, whose heart will get broken next?
i'll take you back of course my dear, just hope that i wont shed a tear and let this go away...."

"event","another poem for you guys..i was influenced by darkest hour with this one...I NEED THOUGHTS!

how are you feeling?
like a god whose feet have been swept away from them?
have the things that made you invincible begin to whither away?


I see it in your eyes, screaming to die, but never want to feel the pain but then again you scream your end
and never want to feel the same the days go by your standing by and want to just whither away i see you cry and want
to die it never seems to go away you seem to me just want to flee but never want to leave your space and in this case
youve hade your taste of what can never be yours again

and now youve had all you can hold and want to hold some more, i cant believe that you would seem just like a fucking whore
thinking the best is just the worst and want to move along but things will never change and you go where you belong
the arms that kept you warm are just as cold as sitting all alone and you cant seem to understand his heart has turned to stone

you seem to me just like you were so many years ago a little girl whos lost her way and never wanted to let go
but now you've changed into this thing that has no intention to live isee your eyes you want to cry and i can never feel the same
ive been through hell you dont see this and want to use me up some more
my tanks on e i want to flee but i just cant to seem to just let go

all of this pain has come again i welcome it with all my heart i cant beleive its seems so me that its so hard to just depart
away form here dont shed a tear, i'll never come back to you it seems to me you're a disease that i can't quite get over"

"event","so yea.. i didnt sleep last night AGAIN!!!o hwell..blame my mind. for theres this nice little song by cold that decided to play in my head over and over again, called ""a different kind of pain"" and that gave me this ridiculous idea to go to the schoolt oday, and to tell kat ""before i let you go, give me just one more chance to show you just how i feel""  but then i got the impression that it would be too late because she decided to go out with him today..(seeing as she decided to go out with me on a friday)...so yea...then the song still played in my head on repeat...and then i would c them together holding hands, and i felt like crap...BUT THEN!! i got this idea....and that was...let's get that fucking idea out of my head.....and the best way to do it is by getting rid of the start of it..so i got up off my couch and put on some MSI you'll rebel to anything....and it helped...here are some lyrics that helped me out...first its ""straight to video"" these are some inspirational lyrics...All aboard
Hit the road
All the bullshit
Can't be ignored
It's hard to place
In my face
No emotion

All the problems make me wanna go
Like a bad girl straight to video
Little darling welcome to the show
You're a failure played in stereo
...hahaha then, the song ""you'll rebel to anything"" which has more inspirational lyrics that go like this...Boo fuckin hoo you're not the only one whose life's a piece of shit
And yet miraculously somehow we all seem to deal with it
Did anybody think that you would really seriously slit your wrists
In fact I think that everybody thinks you're seriously full of shit
You think you're saying something relevant as you connect the dots
You never realized you have to get in line to suck a cock
You're telling me that fifty million screaming fans are never wrong
I'm telling you that fifty million screaming fans are fucking morons

so yea..those 2 songs made me happy, and now im gonna do something non-productive until i collapse at this computer chair...."

dont let these days fade by without her touch
they were poison to your skin, its worthless
youre worth much better then that
so get back on your cloud and wait...

for that angel with the biggest wings to reach your cloud
and take you away
into a land of bliss and total  happiness
but for now, just sit on your cloud and wait

that angel will appear one day, and take you away
your angel will wipe away your past, with a wave of her love
and your heaven will be unleashed, as full as it ever was, and more
nothing will be more enjoyable then that
so sit on your cloud and wait

your pain will subside with the waves that crash upon your shore
your world will open to more beauty, your demons will vanish
hell will dissapear of a flash of light
you will be immortal once again...

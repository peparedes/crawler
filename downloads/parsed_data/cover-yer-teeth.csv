"event","I've felt rather guilty for quite some time for letting <lj user=""the_bathhouse""> become defunct. Although I enjoyed it immensely while it was active, it eventually grew to be too much of an ambitious undertaking. Besides being ridiculously complicated to mod, aside from some of my dear flisties that helped out with image posts, I was doing almost all of the posting in the other categories and it became backbreaking after a while. Plus, I launched <lj user=""the_bathhouse""> just before all the large-file-transfer sites sprang up and soon comms like <lj user=""the_gloryhole""> eclipsed the novelty of static-content comms like mine.

However, despite being not-too-frequently updated, I'm really quite pleased with the way <lj user=""brotherfuckers""> has managed to thrive. The only real mod requirements are to approve memberships, handfuls of applicants for which come in every day. It caters to a niche that people don't really find targeted elsewhere and the community members actually post!

So, while I've got some free time on my hands during the holiday break from school, I'd very much like to renovate <lj user=""the_bathhouse""> and relaunch it with an entirely new premise. However, I'm completely at a loss for what that should be. I've always really liked the idea of what I tried to accomplish with the ""Personal Ads"" section, you know - getting guys off of their computers and helping them hook-up. Problem is, hardly anybody posted hook-up ads and, besides, there's a ton of sites like ManHunt and whatnot especially for just that. I also kicked around the idea of making it more like an actual bathhouse, where members would upload their own amateur vids of themselves jerking off or actually fucking. I'm sure there would be no problem bringing in membership for that, but the number of people that contributed pictures of just general porn was minuscule, before. I imagine that format would see updates even less frequently than <lj user=""brotherfuckers"">. Plus, that's kinda what Xtube is for.

That's why I decided to put it to you, the all-knowing flist! Please, please, throw out any ideas you might have on the matter. Is there anything you would like to see but don't feel like you get enough of it from existing LJ comms? Any and all suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Even if they aren't totally thought out. Who knows? Any observation you might have could snowball into a completely brilliant idea.

We all know I could sure use the help! ;)

Thanks,

~CYT

"event","Okay, so I went and did it.  I started a community called <lj user=""brotherfuckers"">!

This one's pretty straight forward, so I chose a much simpler set up, compared to <lj user=""the_bathhouse"">.  None of the functionality is dependent on tags (or anything, really) so members will be able to post un-moderated.  And, even tho it severely limits my capability to customize the layout, I'll be damned if I'm gonna splash out for Paid Account status for this one.  I had to resort to altering the style sheet to tweak the style that I selected.

In that respect, for any of my handsome LJ friends that want to hop on over there and view the layout to make sure there's no big boo-boos (mainly concerning the width. I thought the default width would get overloaded in a pic-posting community, but I'm working on a widescreen laptop, so I may have stretched it beyond the aspect ratio for regular monitors), there'll be lots of <s>cock sucking & tea-bagging</s> hugs & kisses in it for you. ;P"

"event","There's just a little something I'd like to make aware to people who employ the word ""officially"" when refering to their relationships, e.g.:

<UL><i><LI>We're <b>officially</b> together, now.<LI>We weren't <b>officially</b> dating at that point.<LI>We decided to <b>officially</b> break-up.</i></UL>You are <i>officially</i> a <b>TOOL!</b>

"event","Well, the day you've all been waiting for with baited breath is finally here!  I've actually had my comm all set up for about a month, now, but getting back in the swing of things since school started up again has kept me running a lot more than what I'd expected.

But, there's no point in putting it off any longer so <lj user=""the_bathhouse""> has officially opened its doors!  I know lots of you on my f-list tried to join up just after I opened that account, but that was way back at the start of the summer and your membership requests have all expired, so you'll need to sign up, again.  After you've joined, use the registration page and be sure to tell me if the utility I scripted fucks up in any way.  It's not the purdiest application, but I plan to tweak it some more.

What are you waiting for?  Come get yo' freak on! ;P"

"event","Apparently, if I get bored enough, I finally get motivated to do something productive.  So, I did it.  I started the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/cover_yer_teeth/4762.html"">community I said I was planning.</a>  There's no need to rush to join, just yet, as I've discovered that I'll need to make it a paid account in order to have access to the advanced customizations it'll need to work properly.  Plus, I'm gonna have to secure some server space, somewhere, to run the script for the registration page, since LJ disables JavaScript and the like.

But, the basic layout and info page are up.  Like I said, there's no content yet, but for the supportive peeps on my f-list who encouraged me to do this, feel free to check it out:

<center><font size=5><lj user=""the_bathhouse""></font></center>

I'm beyond indigent, at the moment, so it may be a month, or so, before I can afford to flesh it out (no pun intended ;P).  It only takes 25 chickens to upgrade to paid account status, though, so . . . on the off chance that a kind-hearted philanthropist (or a rabidly horny one . . . whatever) may see this, I'll accept donations here:

Every dollar, or five, makes a difference! ;P"

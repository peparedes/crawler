"event","Just got back from Savannah. I had to stay an extra day because the job site was receiving a shipment for three new buildings, and my team had to check it off and count everything. Beh, it's overtime, so extra monies.

Went out partying last night. We drove 45 minutes out to the small seaside town of Thunderbolt, Georgia.

No... that's way too good to make up.

Anyways, we pulled up to a little place called Tubby's. Well, ""little"" is the wrong word, seeing as the place is more of a friggin' COMPLEX of drunken insanity. Literally, we walked in, and there were so many people, the staff had set up little temp-bars just to serve everyone. Liquor and mixes in gallon jugs, handed out in plastic cups. There were no less than 4 bars in the place, and the whole joint was one massive sardine can of flesh, alcohol, music, and sex. It was unlike anything I've ever seen before.

By one point in the night, I was on a little set of stairs, talking to some girl I'd met named Logan. Cute little redhead, but she was way too feminist and self-empowered to get along with. Fine for conversation, though, especially with how much beer I'd had at the time.

Got back to the hotel by 2:30, woke up with no hangover. I love my Irish blood.

I'm in town for a few weeks now, so if anybody would like to chill, say the word. I'm down for some socializing. I've been practicing. :)

"event","First off, I'd like to thank Kate-mun for the icon. It's the reezy for sheezy. Which means ""awesome"" in my own Brad way.

Well, another week down, and one of the guys on my crew at work quit. So now it's just me and the boss, which oughta be just DANDY. He doesn't do anything anyways except throw nails in a bucket and listen to Usher, so I'm pretty much on my own. Oh, well. I get paid either way, so I'll just do what I do.

Went to a party last night. My cousin's fiancee's birthday. Fairly uneventful, but the burgers were good, so no complaints. I think he and a few others may have been trying to fix me up with a girl there, but the connection never got made, as I don't think I even met the girl. But I just find that whole situation funny, fixing me up with someone.

You know, for the longest time, I looked. I did. I used to be desperate for someone, anyone. I was hollow, and generally unpersonable, but I'm done. I'm tired of hunting, and waiting, and hoping. I'm living life for me now.

It feels good to say that. If love happens, so be it. But almost all of who I thought I was revolved around finding someone to be with, and that was a waste. I lost out on a lot of life looking, when I could have been living, and now I'm aiming to change that. In fact, I think I may have already. I work out of town, and live life completely on my own terms. I've never felt more independent, and never more mature. For once, high school doesn't feel like a blink ago, but like a time in my life I officially look back on as the past. I guess, in a sad way, it took me this long to live that down, but hey: I did, which is more than I can say for a few people. So I'll see you guys around, huh?

Oh, and as a sidenote: I've rediscovered mainstream stuff. Listening to pop-era blink182 never felt so fuckin' good. :)

Listening to that on my PSP while installing a fire sprinkler line (my new job, for those who don't know) makes for consistently interesting days. I've also learned a bit of Spanish during the whole process, which I find amusing.

"event","My past 24 hours have been rough. Wow.

My ride to work called me and said he'd been puking for 12 hours straight. Nice. So then I had to beg the roomie to give a ride to work. He was cool with it, since I cleaned house and all that jazz, but I still got to work a little late. It was no biggie for my bosses, though. They were just glad to have me there.

Because my ride to work is also the only other person certified to operate machinery in the store - besides me. So my night was jam-packed full of moving around 32 water heaters, 12 showers, 14 cabinets, countless mirrors and medicine cabinets, then I had to put all kinds of faucets and other merchandise on the shelves. After that, it was on to the reach truck (kind of like a little skinny forklift that can fit down store aisles), where I had to put 20 pallets into the overhead storage area.

Now this workload, divided two ways, is manageable AT BEST. But on one person... no. There was no excuse for not having scheduled enough people to take that slack, at least a little. Not fun.

After the joyride known as ""work"" was over, I still had to find a ride home. Luckily, my mom had arrived for work a few hours before my shift was over, and I gave her my last five bucks for gas, just to get me home. But her break wasn't till 9am, and I got off at 6am, so I figured I might just crash in her car and get a good nap.

Didn't happen. I never could find a comfortable position. So I spent 3 hours playing my PSP, praying I'd get drowsy (and never did). Finally, at 9:00, my mom came out, and I got my ride home. Upon my arrival, I promptly fell on the couch, and didn't move till an hour ago.


I'm still tired. But the process repeats in 3 hours. I hope my outlook brightens soon."

I've got a lot on my plate, not the least of which is my job crisis. Yes, I work at Home Depot, but they're dissolving my department, therefore I must either transfer to a new department, or get a new job entirely. Corporate sucks, it really does. But more to the point, I despise a lack of job security, so college is definitely in order. At some point.

A car and insurance are too. They'd help with the job thing, and the college thing, so that's where I'm starting. Seems to make sense, right? Only, with no job, I can't buy said car/insurance, therefore, I have a bit of a catch 22 on my hands.

But I did just finish watching Resident Evil: Extinction. Not spectacular, but Wesker was in it (finally), so I can't complain much. The ravens kicked ass. 4 out of 5 stars.


I'm tired, and I still have a MySpace blog to do too, so that'll be it for now. Stay tuned, I guess."

Light weights step to the side when we come in
Feel it in your chest the syllables get pumping
People on the street they panic and start running
Words on loose leaf sheet complete coming
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme, I'm dumping
Healing the blind I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drum and
Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping
Fuck that I wanna see some fists pumping
Risk something, take back what's yours
Say something that you know they might attack you for
Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have before
Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for
Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater the rich and abandon poor
Like they understand you in the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughing their way to the bank and cashing the check
Asking you to have compassion and have some respect
For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day
In their living room laughing like ""what did he say?""

Amen

In my living room watching but I am not laughing
Cause when it gets tense I know what might happen
World is cold the bold men take action
Have to react or get blown into fractions
Ten years old it's something to see
Another kid my age drug under a jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me
Do you see the soldiers they're out today
They brush the dust with bullet proof vests away
It's ironic at times like this you pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
My dad he's got a lot of fear I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back, he hand-wrote a quote inside
""When the rich wage war it's the poor who die""
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day
both scared and angry like ""what did he say?""

With hands held high into a sky so blue
As the ocean opens up to swallow you"

"event","You know, it's been a while since I've experienced heartache. It's a sensation I thought I had managed to leave behind, and one I didn't think I'd ever have the opportunity to come across again. However, I find myself in a state of heartache once again, and... well, it's different this time.

The heartache isn't caused by someone who broke my heart. It's not caused by someone who's even toying with my heart strings. No, this particular heartache is born of confusion, of mixed signals, and a lack of definite position. You see, for a little while now, I've been... well... let's say ""pursuing a potential interest"". And, up until now, I've successfully not let myself get my hopes up over her, or even get attached to her, which I find to be an accomplishment (given my nature when it comes to romance). However, now... well, after a few unfortunately-timed episodes of ""Scrubs"" and a recent occupation with music concerning romance or the lack thereof, my mind - and heart - have seemed to switch gears, to a different pace. One concerning actual feelings for this girl, and how I might appear or act around her. A pace dictating whether I should say something concerning the subject of my attraction, or at least, a return of similar affections.

Which brings me to the heartache. You see, over the years, I've made the nasty habit of becoming overly pessimistic about my luck with women. My mind races with thoughts of whether I'm attractive enough, whether I'm witty enough, am I smothering them, or am I not making enough of an effort. And the more these thoughts swirl, the more they create a whirlpool, one of which I'm having trouble escaping. So here I am, clueless, and due to a bit of negativity, fairly heart-achy.

It's tough to open up this much about something that means so much to me, especially when it's to an open audience of onlookers. Not only that, but after I've been diligent to try and keep this ""interest"" anonymous, I know that there's a few readers out there who, just by the nature of this post, could figure out EXACTLY who I'm talking about, and it frightens me a little. But, maybe, this could be my way of hearing exactly what I need to about this, from exactly the people who need to tell it to me.

So I sit here, heart open and arms outstretched, hoping to find an answer, or at least a helpful perspective. Don't be afraid to post, or even call me, because an overturned turtle would never refuse a generous tip.

Why would I?"

"event","Happy holidays, everyone.

I think this is the first time I ever found Christmas stressful. Sure, it was warm and enjoyable in the end, but to get to this point has been arduous. Expenses (my god, the expenses), the timing, the long hours at work... but, I think it was worth it.

I got gifts for all the people I wanted. I've seen a few friends that I haven't in a while. And most of all, I've done a lot of long-overdue thinking. I'm hashing myself out, and getting myself straight. So, yeah...


If you want to talk, I'm here. Self-change number one:

I'm no longer taking anything for granted. Ever.

So I love you. If you think I'm talking to you, I probably am. If you don't think I'm talking to you, I just might be. And if you think I'm talking to someone else anyways, well... I love you too.

Made a new group of friends a while back, thanks to Sam. Angela, Rezz, Mark, and their random associates are pretty cool, and I hang out with them almost weekly. It may not be for long, but we talk online and stuff, so now the world doesn't feel so lonely. I don't get many chances to broaden my horizons, so this one was welcome.

Speaking of broadening horizons, I got accepted to college a few weeks ago. UNLV (i.e. the University of Nevada - Las Vegas) will be my new home next fall. Waiting on FAFSA to open up for the '07-'08 year so I can get the funding out of the way, but I'm finally getting out. I'm looking for shellshock as well as an education. New place, new people, no knowledge of what the hell I'm doing at all. A fresh start.

That should do the trick.

Picked up some new CDs and games, which help pass the time both at work and home. Games include Bully, NFS: Carbon, and Final Fantasy XII. The CDs... well...

I'll just make another top ten album chart, for my listening pleasure.

1. My Chemical Romance - ""The Black Parade""
2. Plain White T's - ""Every Second Counts""
3. Korn - ""Greatest Hits""
4. Cute is What we Aim For - ""The Same Old Blood Rush With a New Touch""
5. Cobra Starship - ""While the City Sleeps, We Rule the Streets""
6. The Hush Sound - ""Like Vines""
7. Linkin Park - ""Hybrid Theory""
8. Muse - ""Absolution""
9. lostprophets - ""Start Something""
10. Paramore - ""All We Know is Falling""


I think that should do it. I've got a big four-and-a-half-day weekend coming up, so hopefully enough will happen so that I can post again.

She reads a book from across the street,
Waiting for someone that she'll never meet.
Talk over coffee for an hour or two,
She wonders why I'm always in a good mood.
Killin' time before she struts her stuff,
She needs support and I've become the crutch.
She'll never know how much she means to me.
I'd play the game but I'm the referee.

Surrender every word, every thought every sound.
Surrender every touch, every smile, every frown.
Surrender all the pain we've endured until now.
Surrender all the hope that I lost you have found.
Surrender yourself to me.

Even though I know what I'm lookin' for,
She's got a brick wall behind her door.
I'd travel time and confess to her,
But I'm afraid she'd shoot the messenger.

Surrender every word, every thought every sound.
Surrender every touch, every smile, every frown.
Surrender all the pain we've endured until now.
Surrender all the hope that I lost you have found.
Surrender yourself to me.

Searching until my hands bleed,
This flower don't belong to me.

"event","*exhales* ""Heroes"" is waaaaaayyyy too intense for being a TV series. It's the single most engaging show I've ever seen. Beats a lot of movies too. And tonight's episode was no exception. I think I'm starting to prefer the telepathic policeman above the others now, simply 'cause he's tied the closest to the serial killer storyline (which automatically wins, 'cause I'm a big fan of serial killer stories, hence my addiction to ""Criminal Minds"").

I finally figured out how to earn songs on DDR: SuperNOVA, so now I feel gratified, like my money wasn't wasted. Now I just gotta get the songs I want, and I'll be good. That, and maybe get in good enough shape to keep a consistent regiment up. *chuckle* Most people would work out or do yoga. I'll have DDR. Gotta break the mold.

I also rediscovered the ""Snakes on a Plane"" soundtrack. ^.^ I forgot how good all the songs on it actually were, and how many bands on it I actually liked, so I'm keeping a mental note of the bands I approve of, making sure to get their CDs in the near future.

So... I went out last night with my cousins. First we hit Moe's in West Ashley for some food, then Player's Place for some pool. Then we went to Cisco's, which turns into a bar at 11:00 p.m., so naturally I was expecting to leave about that time. My ""party"" had other plans. They stayed for karaoke, and apparently one of my cousins' girlfriends knows the entire staff of Cisco's, so I got to stay. And be served as if legal.

Holy shit.

Normally, my conscience would be shouting angrily at me at this stage. I'd get all nervous, and shut up and chill in a corner, trying to be as inconspicuous as possible. But I didn't. With no danger of carding, I bought a Jack and coke, amaretto and Coke, an amaretto sour, and a Corona. And had fun. I even sang a song for karaoke: ""Dance, Dance"" by Fall Out Boy. Hey, it's better than Aaron Neville, 'cause some actually sang a song by him.

Yesterday, I caught the movie ""Jet Li's Fearless"" with Sam. Now, understand, I'm not that big a fan of martial arts movies. Never appealed to me. But ""Fearless"" did a damn good job. I give Jet Li some credit: the dude went out with a bang. It was nice. Then, after a few hours of ambient nothingness, Sam and I had the stupid idea of hanging out with Amy. She talked... and talked... and talked. About nothing we even cared about, or even remembered. It was miserable, but I'm a better person now for surviving that hardship. Somebody reading this post might think I'm just being shallow for saying what I've said about Amy, but seriously... YOU hang out with her. Just try.

Today, I woke up after sleeping in till a whopping 8:15 a.m. I watched ""Halloween II"" on SciFi before my mom dragged me out to get McDonald's with my sister on her lunch break.

It's 75% mind-blowingly funny, 25% gross-out, but 100% awesome. A must-see for anybody with a soul. Got back, came home, and started watching The Dudesons. I guess I'm just in a mood.

Work was okay.

Alright, now that that's taken care of, on to more interesting news. I called Lowe's back and scheduled my first interview for 9:00 a.m. on Monday. Apparently (according to neighbors) there's a series of interviews and tests I have to survive before I even make orientation. Hrm. We'll see about this.

And I'm also booked by Sam tomorrow night to help with Berkeley High's band's concessions. It was seriously fun last time. This time should prove the same. Weekend's open, though, and for the exception of Monday morning, it's all open, so gimme a call or something.

Now for my re-entry into my emo-music phase. Just the music, though.

"event","So Lowe's called me back. Perhaps I've actually got a shot at escaping 84 Lumber hell. Now if I can just get off work early enough to call the place back, I might be in business. Literally.

Today wasn't that bad. A little stressful at the end, but it usually is anyways, so I'm not gonna make a big deal out of it. Just glad to be home, showered, and fed. It makes a happy Brad.

Maybe there's light at the end of the tunnel. Just gotta open my eyes.

"event","Hmm... So that's what a friggin' monsoon feels like. Geez.

Aside from taking a few hundred unintended showers today, I didn't do that much. Work is work, y'know?

But I have been battling a minor bout of loneliness. So I'm bombarding my head with positive music and various cool stuff to keep my head in the clouds. I've got my mind on a select few girls right now, none of whom I'm sure know. One, maybe. But the others, not really. Eh. Maybe I'll grow some cajones.

Got home out of the rain and took a hot shower. I followed that up with a big bowl of chicken noodle soup, and right now, I'm chill. In the metaphorical sense, of course.

"event","Feh. Woke up at 4:30 this morning, then decided I wouldn't accept that, so I passed back out till 6:30. Then I got up and went to work, where my manager decided he'd have me go out and work in a tropical storm for the day (even though Ernesto didn't really get close enough to mean much of anything.) I was still bitter about it.

Then, in a dramatic up-swing, I asked to leave and get some food, and he told me I could take the rest of the day off, automatically taking him from hated to praised. Go figure.

I got home, changed out of soggy clothes, and took a long, hot shower. 3 fudge muffins and a few episodes of ""I Love the 70's"" later, I'm in a chipper mood. ^.^

That, and with my head in the condition it's in, plus the house being in the condition IT'S in, all signs pointed to taking a sabbatical.

So I did.


Oh, and I rediscovered Linkin Park. I forgot how much it acted as a comfort band to me. ^.^"

"event","So... I have that feeling again. The feeling that a massive, highly positive opportunity has passed me by. I missed the train. I blinked, and I lost it. Now I've got to face the regret of not saying something when I had the chance.

It makes me sick, this feeling. I absolutely hate it when it's here, and it comes around more often than I feel it should. It's kinda making me bitter.

I think like this: If I wait for the right moment to say something, nothing can go wrong. But if I wait too long, the opportunity I'm pursuing might decide to remove itself from the picture, so my moment never gets here. It's in this exact situation (and only this situation) where I don't want to take a risk, because someone could get hurt, but at the same time, I feel like I should take the risk or nothing could ever happen.

It's like Russian Roulette and I'm not the one holding the gun.

Where's my spine?

"event","Semi-eventful day.

Woke up, battling my way to a 9:15 awakening. Hung around the house a little while, then rolled out with Sam. We went and saw ""Accepted"" (which is pretty decent, by the way), and from there we headed back to his place for a while. After killing some time, we picked up Dawn, then Steve, and proceeded to Royal Z Lanes, where I discovered how much I suck at bowling. My skills have actually DEgraded since I last played. Go figure.

Then we dropped by Steve's place, grabbed his Xbox 360, and dropped it off at my house. My mom had gone to the thrift store and gotten me random clothing and gave it to me (about which she had stayed up late just to show me). We ran off again, ate Wendy's, then returned to play some video games.

They left. I'm here, posting. There you have it.

Sorry I'm not capable of anything profound or witty right now. I think I'm tired. And kinda pensive. More later, if I can figure it out.

"event","I don't think I've ever been so excited about getting days off as I was today. I have the weekend. The whole weekend.

: )

Today was pretty much a carbon copy of yesterday, only I kinda fried my phone in the rain. It cut back on after a while, and everything runs smoothly except for the screen. It fades in and out, averaging functionality about 15% of the time. I guess I'll just try to dig my numbers out of it and put in for a replacement. Luckily, I have a full insurance plan, even though I have to pay a $50 deductible. It'll be worth it to get a brand-spanking new phone.

So... who's free? I got time. I got time.

"event","Work was actually fun today. It rained... the WHOLE day. A constant, steady downpour. So it was just me, my forklift, and the storm, and as I was working, I started feeling more and more primal. I was working in the elements, the wind rocking me and the rain pelting me. Thunder and lightning struck, with me driving a mobile lightning rod.

Stupid, probably. Fun, hell yes.

I re-entered the store for my lunch break with the biggest grin on my face. I'm pretty sure it scared somebody. But I pounded down my salad and returned to the storm. Awesome.

Now I'm just chillin', listening to ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" soundtrack and watching TV on mute.

Relaxed as hell.

"event","So, I'm going through the ""Snakes on a Plane"" soundtrack (which I haven't seen yet, but plan on it) I got last weekend, and most of it's remixes. Good ones at that. That, and it's a who's-who of my favorite bands: Panic! at the Disco, The Hush Sound, Gym Class Heroes, The Sounds, so on and so forth. It's even got the main score for the movie on it.

Plus a 3D cover. ^.^

Got around to picking up some CDs I've been meaning to get, too. Linkin Park, Quarashi, Tool, and Adema. Good stuff. Kept me occupied. Kudos to Monster Music for it. Their new CDs will shaft you, but their used section is beyond compare.

Besides that, work was tolerable, and my mom made turkey roast and baked potatoes. Sweet.

"event","Since someone (who shall remain nameless for now) forced me to log onto LJ after months away, I suppose I should post something.  Don't get excited, it's just a dream:
I had decided to skip work or school the next day and was about to leave for whatever evening activity was related to my planned absence.  I was in the driveway, about to get into my car, when my father told me I couldn't go do what I'd planned.  I was puzzled.  I reminded him of the agreement I've always had, with life, with my parents (ok, maybe it was just my mother, I realized in the middle of my sentence, and let it trail off):  ""I am brilliant, capable, and generally quite responsible, so whenever I want to do something completely irresponsible, I can.  This is...""
I couldn't quite figure out if he had the authority to stop me.  I wasn't clear whether I was still in school, or still living at my parents' house, or what, but I was fairly confident that I could survive losing whatever support (of any kind) he was providing me, if any.
It occurred to me as possible that he could physically prevent me from leaving.  So I made a feint toward another car in the driveway--his car, or my mother's car--and when he followed, I darted quickly to my car, got inside, locked the door and started the engine.  
He managed to grab hold of the rear bumper, so that as I drove away, he was being dragged behind my car.  I thought surely he would let go, but he didn't.  I sped up a bit, frustrated with his refusal to give up.  He continued to cling.  Finally, I punctuated my over-the-shoulder shouts of ""let go,"" with ""no wonder my mother won't speak to you.""  I instantly regretted saying it, but it worked.  He let go immediately.
I continued on.  After a bit, I got a cell phone call from my father.  He was apparently hurt rather badly and wanted me to come back and drive him to the hospital.  I wavered, definitely willing to delay/detour to get him medical attention, but not so willing to do so if it was going to involve him attempting once again to prevent me from doing what I wanted.  
I don't remember what conclusion I came to, or what happened next.  Maybe the dream skipped over that part.  Maybe my subconscious is unsure of just how selfish I am.
The rest of the dream was about what I did the next day, which didn't turn out at all the way I wanted.  (Which was partially Kate's fault!)  (As is this post.)"

"event","As a fan of molecular gastronomy, I'd been wanting to try its only outpost in NYC for a while.  Of course we had to order the nine-course tasting menu.
The bread was paper-thin sesame crisps, which we all agreed were as good as anything else we were served.
The amuse involved pickled sardine, carrot, and ginger.  While the presentation was nice, it tasted pretty much like every other pickled fish I've ever had.  J hates sardines, and hated this dish.  C seemed happy enough.
The first course was pizza balls(?) with pepperoni and mushrooms.  This was perhaps the weirdest course, and one of my favorites (which isn't saying much), but only once I figured out how to eat it.  The waiter explained that we should be sure to get enough of the gooey dollops on each round ball and encouraged us to eat with our hands (as one does with pizza), but this was inadequate.  If you held the ball in your mouth for a few seconds until it began to dissolve on its own, the result was lovely, but if you bit into the ball too soon, an annoyingly dry powder coated your tongue and the flavors didn't blend.  J never got the hang of it and hated this dish.  C seemed happy enough.
The second course was supposed to be ""Knot Foie,"" foie gras tied in a knot, but since neither J nor I likes foie gras, we opted for a substitution.  They brought us a soybean gazpacho, with crab, ramps, and pomegranate etc., which we both found interesting and pleasant.  Having never tried foe gras before, C tried the Knot Foie; he seemed happy enough with it.
The third course was sweetbreads, with an interesting green goo (I can't remember what was in it) that I might have liked in a different dish, with maple syrup marinated water chestnuts cut to look like tiny french fries.  I don't like sweetbreads, so I was not terribly surprised to find this dish inedible.  J had liked sweetbreads the first time she had then, but then I told her what they are, and that may have colored her palate.  C had no idea what they were (and I opted not to tell him), called them ""shortbread"" a couple of times, and seemed happy enough.
The fourth course was beef tongue with fried mayo, tomato molasses, and bits of iceberg lettuce.  J and I decided that the tongue looked and tasted like bologna (but with an unpleasant edge) and that the dish as a whole must be some odd high-brow play on a low-brow sandwich.  The fired mayo and tomato molasses were both interesting, but not delicious.  C seemed happy enough with it all.
The fifth course was french onion soup.  We were surprised to find that it was simply french onion soup.  The only odd bit was the gruyere balls that did the whole ""explode in your mouth"" thing I enjoy so much.  J found the broth too strong, and while she usually likes gruyere, she didn't like it in this dish.  C seemed happy enough.
The sixth course was surf clams with compressed watermelon and fermented black bean (arranged to look like watermelon seeds).  I liked this dish, as did J, but we agreed that the watermelon should be tasted on its own, and *definitely not* in the same bite with the ""seeds.""  The beans did go nicely with the clams, however, which were sliced in long strings.  It was all pretty together.  C seemed happy enough.
The seventh course was lamb belly (which prompted me to wonder why I've never seen bacon made from anything but pig before).  I expected the sort of thick-cut juicy bacon upscale restaurants normally serve as ""pork belly,"" but the lamb belly was well-done, crispy (like my trichinosis-phobic mother would make it), but a bit gamey like lamb can be.  J, who dislikes lamb, hated it.  C seemed happy enough.  
The palate cleanser/desert amuse was a yummy plum sorbet with exceptional feta, feta sorbet, and mediocre plum wedges.  J and I liked it, especially once she put her feta in my dish.  C seemed happy enough.
The eight course was fried butterscotch pudding (weird), with taro sorbet (vile), crispy taro (interesting) and mango shavings (almost flavorless).  This was J's favorite course and one of my least favorites.  C seemed happy enough.
The course was soft chocolate, with chocolate crumbs, avocado, lime, and a line of licorice (that tasted like molasses).  I liked this course quite a bit.  J was happy that the avocado dollops were obvious, and thus avoidable.  C seemed happy enough.
The petit fours were marshmallow squares and delicious jelly-filled peanut-butter balls.  J and I both liked the PB&J a lot.  C seemed happy enough.
J and I had shared a set of wine pairings.  Two of the wines, including one rose, were interesting enough that she wrote them down for future reference.  C tried a couple of different specialty cocktails, including one tropical one that he had several of, and a mezcal, watermelon, and pink peppercorn sugar one (ordered at my request) that I liked quite a bit.

Overall, the meal was quite a disappointment for me.  Few of the dishes were as interestingly experimental as I'm used to from molecular gastronomy, and none of them were anything I need to have again.  The rushed pre-theater brunch we'd had at Maze earlier in the day was far more satisfying (and considerably less expensive).  I promised J I'd never make her go back to WD-50 again (well, except then I hedged, because there's an entree I really want to try--a sea trout with fava beans, forbidden rice, rootbeer-date, and lovage--and she liked the desserts and could just have more of them--WD-50 offers 3- and 5-course dessert tastings) and that next time we'll do something simple like a steakhouse.  I suspect that would please C as well; despite his calm handling of everything put in front of his, this was about as extreme a choice as we could have found in NYC for his first experience with a tasting menu."

"event","I recently dreamed suicide.  It all started happily enough, at an E party.  Then I was driving home(?) and realizing that I was in no shape to drive.  I pulled over to the side of the road, in the middle of nowhere, with a vague intention of wandering aimlessly in the wilderness for a few hours until I was more competent.  But when I got out of the car, I discovered I'd parked it not on the shoulder, but in the left lane of the highway.  Fortunately, there wasn't much traffic.  I got back in to move the car.  I made it to the right lane and was backing up onto the shoulder when I noticed another car there, and some people.  One was sitting or laying on the ground, possibly injured; one was kneeling next to the first; a couple of others were standing around.  I recognized that continuing to back up where I wanted to park would bring me dangerously close to them (they realized this too, and began shouting), but I thought I could do it if I went slowly.  I was wrong.  There was a terrible sound/feeling as I ran over the person on the ground.  I decided in an instant that I could neither handle the consequences of this nor avoid them, so without a second thought, I revved the engine, and drove as fast as I could toward, and off, a cliff."

A: The lack of personal information is probably intentional, but I did obligate myself to answer questions, so I'll give it a try.  
I live in a small fortress of solitude a good hour's drive from any of my friends and considerably farther from my family.  
I have a job that I love but do not talk much about.  
I get out of bed in the morning because, much as I love my bed (and I do love my bed) and all the things that happen there (not least of which are my dreams), even more things happen *out* of my bed, so spending more than 1/3 of my time there would be limiting.  
What things are important to me... this feels like one of those questions to which the answer would fluctuate wildly depending on when it was asked.  Right now I'd say freedom, experiences, variety, and competence."

A: That's easy; I remember the moment I met you.  It was my second meeting, and I'd decided I was going to talk to someone this time, and you were standing outside with BM during the break.  He'd been demo-bottoming, seemed infinitely approachable, and was smoking, which gave me the easy opening of bumming a cigarette (not that I smoke, but I can if it's useful), so I met you both that way.  Was that the same night I was blindfolded at The Lure?  I miss The Lure.

A: Probably one of our early conversations.  I miss those too."

A: Yes.  I miss my brothers.  I miss long, straight, empty highways with equally long, straight, empty access roads on both sides.  I miss men wearing boots with tuxedos.  (To name just a few things.)

Q: ""Why do you hate to talk on the phone?""
A: I don't know.  It's an odd irrational thing...  Sometimes it's worse than others, for no apparent reason.  It helps a lot if I know the conversation will be a simple exchange of logistical details; it's easier if I think of it as ""I need to tell so-and-so such-and-such,"" rather than ""I'm about to have a conversation with so-and-so.""  The irrational phobia part only happens *before* the call, however, or at least before the other person answers.  Once we're talking, the phobia feeling dissipates.  But I still don't particularly enjoy phone conversations.  I can't fully engage (maybe I'm too visual?), but I can't do anything else at the same time either.

Q: ""Why are there 8 K's in Kat?""
A: Kat was taken (of course), and the maximum screenname length was 10 characters, so I filled all the available space with extra K's.  It's my favorite letter.

Q: ""I realize that your red boots are precious... will you wear black ones sometime so that I can black them?""
A: Absolutely.  I have ordinary black boots that I wear all the time (which have salt stains professionals have been unable to fix), black shark-skin cowboy boots (probably with white stitching, like the red ones), black steel-toed Doc's, and black thigh boots.  Which would you prefer?  And I'd love you to clean the heirloom red ones up as much as possible, too, sometime, though I understand the possibilities there are limited."

In the first scene I remember, I was in a back room or basement of a house or place of business with a bunch of people trying to decide what we were going to do.  Someone came into the room to tell us that a few representatives of a gang of dangerous criminal types were outside the building and demanding... someone whose name I can't remember.  She was a woman: small, blond, and understandably frightened.  She started to go.  I stood up and said, ""I'm going with you.""  I knew there was nothing I could actually do if I went with her; I'd probably share her fate, or be shot just for walking out the front door.  I took her hand and walked out with her.
Several guns took aim as we appeared in the doorway.  The men were clearly nonplussed by my presence.  ""I'm going with her,"" I said.  The henchmen made various comments, ranging from scornful to amused to angry to threatening.  One stepped forward and put the barrel of his gun to my head, about to pull the trigger.  But the leader smiled and gestured for him to stand down.  
I got into the back seat of the car, next to the blond.  There was no one in the back seat but the two of us, but she sat in the middle, close to me but not touching.  I sat behind the driver.  She sat bolt upright, on the edge of her seat, looking forward anxiously.  I slumped back, all my muscles relaxed, staring out the window, hoping that my presence made her a little less afraid."

It was still the same night, but now I was on some sort of treasure hunt through NYC, as were a lot of Burning Man types.  There were signs in various places to let people know they were on the right track, but they didn't really tell you where to go next.
One sign was near an entrance to an elevated subway line, and I wavered about whether to get on the subway or go past it.  Past it looked more appealing--an apparently abandoned waterfront--and I the subway could take me a long way away.  But everyone else seemed to be climbing the stairs to the subway, so I decided to join them.  (Gosh, my dreamself was such a sheep!)
Later, on a subterranean subway platform, I came across a large pile of wrapped presents.  Each had a tag on it with a ""Please deliver to _________"" note with an address.  Someone I knew was examining a package from the top of the pile carefully to see if it was a bomb or something dangerous.  I began looking through the pile for one with an address near somewhere I might be going, so I could deliver it.  I came across a package with no address, but with my name on it.

[Once I woke up I was delighted to have been able to read both the treasure hunt signs and the tags on the packages.  Normally, I can't read in dreams, and trying to do so is so frustrating as to wake me up.]"

I've been at work for less than two hours now, spent half of that time in a meeting (in which I didn't fall asleep, there's a victory!), and yet still managed to make two mistakes, both in e-mail, and thus requiring acknowledgment and retraction, rather than simple repair.  Maybe it would be better for everyone if I avoided work for the rest of the day."

"event","A couple of nights ago, I dreamed that the world was about to end.  
There was a possibility of avoiding it, however.  I was in a caravan of vehicles driving down a road toward some sort of very large doorway.  If we passed through the doorway after it was activated, but before the end of the world, then it would all be ok.  Timing was tricky, because any vehicle passing through the doorway before it was activated--and no one was sure quite when that would be--would disappear (in a bad way) or something, but anyone that didn't make it through the doorway before the end would, of course, perish along with the rest of the world.  Passing through the doorway after it was activated, however, seemed to assure not just survival in some other place, but continued life in the world as we know it.  That didn't make much sense, which could be why the dream shifted at that moment.
The curved line of vehicles traveling along the road became a curved line of symbols drawn across the sky, moving at the same pace.  As a symbol reached a certain point in the sky, it would disappear.  If They (the Government?  Scientists?) managed to activate it before the last symbol got to that point and disappeared, then the world would be saved.  Otherwise, it would explode.
I was at the house of a friend, who was throwing some sort of party.  Someone wanted a glass of red wine (a simple last request) but the hostess said she didn't have any.  She handed me a beer and a pitcher of Bloody Marys.  I asked who wanted Bloody Mary and was surprised when all nine of the people in the living room raised their hands.  I went into the kitchen to find glasses.  I didn't think there was enough in the pitcher for nine full glasses, but I wasn't sure I could find that many glasses anyway; maybe I could fill half that number and people could share; but nine wasn't divisible by two.  The kitchen was a scene of chaos.  There were too many people and too much clutter.  Someone was frantically trying to finish cooking something that I could tell would never be ready in time.  I found some plastic glasses in the dish rack and set them on the counter to pour, but the person cooking began to frantically fill them with... cookie dough?  I think maybe I gave up at this point.
I went out on the front porch where several people were gathered, watching the progression of the symbols across the sky.  I'd hooked up with a guy--played in the dream by Bruce Willis--recently, and he was there with me.  I thought how nice it was to ""have a big, strong, man to hold at the end.""  Almost immediately, I became uncomfortable in his embrace.  I extricated myself and took a few steps forward, standing alone on the steps of the porch, watching the sky, waiting for death.
The curve of symbols moved slowly across the sky.  When the last one reached the disappearing point, we all knew They had failed to activate it.  The world was going to end.  At some point, what we were watching had changed from the sky to a large-screen TV, which now showed a symbolic representation of a couple of chain-reaction steps and finally the two explosions that would destroy the world.  I felt a physical pain in my heart, and then a moment of queasiness, both of which quickly passed.  
The screen had indicated the end of the world, but nothing had happened where we were.  At first, we thought maybe there was a delay for the destruction to spread.  Like when nuclear weapons hit, but more distant places are finished off by spreading radiation later.  But that wasn't what was supposed to happen here.  So the world wasn't going to end after all.  It had all been a prank.  People began to realize that the news show we'd been watching was on Comedy Central, and no one actually had any confirmation of the world's end beyond that.  
People began to celebrate.  I felt a bit foolish, but mostly, I felt disappointment.  I had been ready for the world to end.  I had been ready to die, but it hadn't happened.  I walked away from the house, wanting to be away from the happy people.  
Unfortunately, a few people ran after me, including the character played by Bruce Willis.  At some point, he said something that suggested he felt somewhat like I did.  I didn't care.  We got into an elevator in a seemingly abandoned building.  Bruce--who was dressed like a matador at this point--held out his hands, and I took a wreath of red roses from around my neck (an action made difficult somehow by the large number of helium balloon tied by long ribbons to my left wrist) and gave it to him.  He put it around his neck and began to Flamenco by himself."

"event","I have had two migraines in the past two weeks.  I don't like this pattern.  Both started at physical therapy.
The first began probably around 2:00pm on Friday, June 23.  I had just finished PT and was in the locker room changing when I noticed the auras.  I don't remember many other details clearly, since it happened two weeks ago.  I went and got something to eat (with PT scheduled for lunchtime, I'd eaten a larger breakfast than usual and postponed lunch until after PT) then back to work, trying to ignore it.  The symptoms seemed to follow the usual pattern, except that the auras came back again later in the process.
The second one started around 6:30pm on Wednesday, July 5.  I had been at PT for about half an hour and was on the treadmill, facing a mirror, when I noticed that I couldn't see my left eye.  I looked around at various surfaces, trying to see an aura, but all I had was a blinds spot where the auras often are.  Still, I knew what was happening.  Soon enough, an aura replaced the blind spot.  I decided that PT was probably one of the best places to have a migraine, since I could do everything I needed to do there without relying on my vision.  (I've realized recently that the thing that bothers me the very most about migraines is that they are such a huge waste of time, and I have too much to do to let my time be wasted.)  It worked pretty well.  I continue to be fascinated by my inability to recognize familiar things--like my PT's face, and, later, my own face in the locker room mirror--while having a migraine.  The visual symptoms were pretty much over by the time I left, so I felt safe to drive.  My left arm went numb around 7:44 (I'd been wondering why that hadn't happened yet) and stayed that way for 10 minutes.  When the feeling returned, it was gradual, starting with my fingers and working its way slowly up my arm, which seems backward somehow.
I was dreading it happening again at PT the next day, but it didn't."

"event","I decided I didn't need to set an alarm the night before I left for Florida.  I had a long, winding dream about missing my flight.  Obstacles preventing me from getting to the airport included:
*leaving luggage at an airport
*leaving luggage on a bus
*the astounding failure of a New York cabbie to catch up with the bus, which only had a three-block head start
*confusion about the bus system's lost-and-found rules
*trying to find the tow lot, somewhere in an outer borough, to which my car had been towed.  Two friends had joined me at this point.  Being told, by a stranger, ""you can't *walk* there.""  
*having to stop and politely watch a chef friend-of-a-friend prepare a seafood dish
*fleeing underground when I found the demonstration too tedious to bear any longer
*being besieged in a tower by monsters.  I accidentally found a way out, not realizing this until I was safely on the other side of the monsters' line.  I felt kinda bad about abandoning my friends, who were still besieged, but I didn't think I could make it back in and out again.  Anyway, it wasn't like they were actually in danger--the besieging monsters were just another obstacle to keep my from the airport.  Still, I wouldn't have left them like that under ordinary circumstances, but I had a plane to catch.  
* running up a series of flights of stairs and through a series of rooms, but each time I opened a door to a new flight or room I found myself back at the beginning of the series again.  Still, each time I made it one step further, so I was making progress.  It reminded me of those children's stories/songs where each verse adds another element but repeats all the previous ones too.
*stealing a car (possibly mine)
*pulling over to ask for directions at a gas station (this should have been a tip-off that it was a dream)
*having to set a stranger's broken finger
Around this point, I realized that it was already past the time for my flight to leave.  
At some earlier point, it had crossed my mind that perhaps this was all a dream, but I didn't let that interrupt.  It was, of course.  I woke up at exactly the time the alarm is set for on days I go to work."

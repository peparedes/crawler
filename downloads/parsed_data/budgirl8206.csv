 Sorry I haven't been on in a while. If you want to know about nascar then here it is. Jimmie Johnson won on sunday, Dale Jr. finished 6th after having a hard day. I was very proud of him. I was happy that I got to see almost all of the race the last 20 laps I listened to it on the radio on my way to church. Last night I stayed the night at the Maxwells house (they ae gils from my church) and we pranked the guys from the youth and just had some fun. Then we went to sleep & woke up. I took Heather home then I went to the bank then I came home. Me and Rachel hung out at my house then we went swimming. We came to her house then we went back to my house and went swimming again with Daniel, Ashley, Jessica, Laura, Patrick, & Rachel. It was very fun. Now I am staying the night at Rachels house. Well later!!!

 Sorry I haven't wrote in a while. I went to a JC meeting Saturday morning at 10 and we talked about camp and got the campers put into cabins. Then I came home and shot pool and went swimming in my swimming pool. Umm..Rachel, Ashley, and Daniel stayed the night at my house. We rented ""Stuck on You"" (great movie by the way) then I talked to my friend Cody by text messaging because he lives in Duncan. I went to church yesterday morning and then I came home and watched nascar. I left before it was over so I listened to it on the radio but still missed the last 17 laps because I was in church. Then after church all the youth and some parentals went to Boomerange. We hung out talked. Then all the girls except Taylor went to the Maxwells house and stayed the night. We stayed up and talked about everything and I mean everything. Then we woke up around 7 because we had VBS, but I didn't go to VBS because I had to clean my room and because I wasn't enrolled. So I came home and went to sleep then did that. Then I took a shower and now I am writing this. So until later!!!

PS. Dale Jr finished 3rd after being a lap down most of the day and he is now 98 points ahead of Jimmie Johnson. YEAH!!!"

 Today I went swimming around 12 until about 2 with Rachel and Dallas. Then we went to drop off the movies I rented from Blockbuster. While we were in Mustang we stopped by Beuatyco and got a job application for me because I need a job. Then we went to Dollar General in Tri-City to get a cup because one broke. We had to get them for my campers at camp. Then we came home. After I filled out the application we went and turned it back in and while we were there I bought some tanning lotion, and we saw a huge wreck it was pretty bad. Then we went to Wal-Mart to look for some nail polish. Then we came back home and went swimming until about 7 something. Then Rachel went home and I ate supper and took a shower. Then my parents went to Troy's house and I stayed home. Rachel came over about 8:30 then she stayed the night. And we watched my favorite show Higher Ground it was awesome. Well later.

 Today I kind of just hung out at home. Around 5ish my friend Kristie Hadjiconstantinou came over and we hung out in my room and talked and listened to music. Then we went swimming in my pool. Finally around 7 something we got out and ate dinner. Then we watched tv then we decided to dye her hair brown that was cool. Well later bye

 Well today I woke up and went to church. Then I came home and watched the Womens World College Series of Softball, and it was pretty good. I fell asleep in the middle of the UCLA & Stanford game. I woke up around 5 something. Then I watched the Coca-Cola 600 race on Fox 25. Dale Jr. finished 6th (not to bad of a finish) and he is still in the points lead by 5 points over Jimmie Johnson. Jimmie Johnson won the race, but in the end Dale Jr. will come out on top because he is the best. Tonight I think I am going to go hang out with my friends but I am not quite sure because I have a huge headache. I think I might just hang out here for one night. Since I have been with people everyday since I got out of school on May 21. I know this day was boring but hey what can I say. Well later!

PS. ROCK ON!!!"

 Today after waking up at Rachel's. I went swimming at my house and it was fun because I noticed I got calf muscles. Then I went to Norman to my church camp which is called Camp Rock Creek for those fellow Church of Christ members who know what I am talking about. I saw some people i hadn't seen in a long time. Malyri was being crazy because she wanted to get hit by a paintball (Ouch!!!). Then Dar decided to break them all over Rachel, Malyri, and me, so we got blue paint on us and our clothes. But Rachel got most of it. Then Dallas decided to copy Dar and did it to but only to Rachel. Then we left because of the storms that were popping up in our great state, but nothing came toward us. So me and Rachel came to my house after talking to Malyri's little sis Anistyn in the car while we waited for the parentals to quit talking. OMG!! Her sis is so cute she says some of the cutest things. She was saying something then right in the middle she goes ""I don't wanna talk about it anymore"" I guess you had to be there. ""Bloaty"" she said that to and it was cute. The reason I am so stressed is because of the whole camp situation and I know Rachel is to because we want her to go to her moms cabin but she doesn't know if she is going to so yeah I am a little stressed because I want some of my friends in there with me. But I don't know if they are going to go to her moms cabin. Okay you probably don't care but if you are a nascar car fan like me Dale Jr. (the hottest guy and best racer) was the fastest in both practices today and starts 10th tomorrow!! OH YEAH!! Well I am going to let Rachel write in her journal so byes!!

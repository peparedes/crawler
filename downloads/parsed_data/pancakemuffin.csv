"event","my friend greggreg got a livejournal and posted a bulletin on myspace to add him, and i remember that I myself have a livejournal. but since the last time i posted so much other things have happend so i guess i'm going to start over

because now summer is over, or almost over. i'm going to camp and coming back and then it's my birthday. always at the beginning of a school year. it's kind of like having your birthday near christmas and then christmas robbing all your birthday gifts. but back-to-school-shopping robs my birthday gifts. damnit. 

javi and i are happy. me and my friends are happy. i complain too much and i'm never fully satisfied but that'll be okay. there's this guy named trey who calls too much. it's real annoying. if you like me, dont call me. ever. let me call you, because that means i actually want you. i dont call guys they call me. it's complicated. i'm complicated.

tomorrow i go garage sale shopping with my mommy. :D"

"event","he gets the night off, and doesn't call/text me once. he had no work all damn day but we didn't get to see eachother. all the time he's telling me 'man i had to work all day and we dont get to see eachother and blabla' but the one day he DOESN'T have to work i cant see him//because he is with his buddys. did i mention his buddys like to ditch him and yell at him all the time, but still he seems to pick them over me because they have the drugs?"

"event","this morning he woke me up by calling at 4 in the morning. it was his call to say 'goodnight' i guess you could say. he told me he couldn't go to sleep without seeing me. even though before he called me i was ALREADY asleep,after his call i felt the same. so,around 7 he comes and picks me upp, we go over to mikey's. stuff happens,and it's the first time i've actually cried since we've been back together. i dont want to cry anymore.

you see, my new years resolution was not to get hurt.
i wont get hurt

i came back around 9, when my mom called, and told her i was at the donut shopp and just walked my doggie around all morning. bullshit. he wants to see me again today..i'll make it better :)

"event","so, this is my first entry. didn't want a myspace, too many people know about the xanga, and this'll work for now. a little update on things, eh?

my boyfriend for two years left me for another girl the week before valentines day because he was on too much drugss. he came back three days ago, i let him. my parents dont know, if they did they'd kill me. people are slowly finding out about us again. most dont know what i'm thinking but how are you suppose to stop love? he says every kiss will be a sorry. maybe if you were me you'd understand.

for spring break i went to europe! germany, italy, switzerland, and austria for 10 days. it was 'adventurous', as my mom calls it, and so much fun. i wanna go back, believe me

i'm going to figure out what this livejournal is all about. i'll write later i promise!<3"

Being happy with who I am and having found someone who appreciates all of my odd quirks, rather than making me feel like a freak. Being myself around people, rather than masking my imperfections (or too perfections) -- and realizing that more people like me that way."

"event","""Have you been drinking tonight?""

I should have answered:
""Why yes, mom, I have. I've been drinking a bottle of Dr. Pepper and drinking from the cup of Life. The Dr. Pepper was great, but what really sent me over the edge was the Life. My night was filled with so much Life that I was just utterly intoxicated by it. And you know, the main ingredients of Life are Love and Friendship and Laughter, and those just heighten the intoxication. I was giddy, I was giggly, I was smiling, I couldn't stop laughing, my eyes were shining, and I had the strange urge to just lay my head on his lap and never leave Emily's house. Life had me so delirious that I wished the six of us could just stay there forever, and watch Reefer Madness and Appliance Direct commercials over and over, and listen to Brian play the piano and maybe I'd eventually learn. And we could even go outside and jump around on Alex's car some more, to Tchaikovsky this time. But then, I had to leave, because you wanted me home by midnight. And the Life buzz wore off, slowly but surely, from the time I walked in the door. There was no more epileptic seizure dancing, no more car raves, no more laughter. I sat on the computer and wished I could have never left. So, in conclusion, I have been drinking, and I am intoxicated. But not like you, in your naivety, think I have been.""

What I really said:
""HA! Mom, Emily is Mormon and both of her parents were home. Besides, don't you know my friends and I at all?"""

The story, the emotion, the phrase that's just bursting to get out of me. Most of what I write starts out in my head, maybe just as a little nagging idea. But it grows and it grows and it grows until it feels like I'm going to explode if I don't get it out of me. And then I write it down. And hope I managed to get the feeling out right."

   ""... But we didn't get to really TALK, like we usually end up doing. There was the briefest tease of an emotional, intellectual conversation, cut cruelly short by the glaring red clock digits. Tonight though, I was on my own. It was an odd feeling -- I'd gotten used to having you to chat with and bounce ideas off. I think that's why I feel like this tonight and why I'm writing this, to fill that void. You take all the raw brain-vomit I spew normally, and you turn it somehow into gourmet mental cuisine. You focus me, make me really stop and think for once about what matters to me and why I am the way I am. I like it. It's good for me. I need it.
   I want to be your muse. When you write a sonnet, I want to be the first thing that comes to mind when you think love. I want you to see me stare off into space, or make a face, and have to take a picture of it. When you're composing a song, I want you to think about the melody of my laughter.

""Each time she saw him, it was like a ritual. The getting ready, for which she always left plenty of time. As if it was not to be hurried, this part, no more than the lovemaking for which it was a preparation. The slow bathing and the careful dressing, and teh dreaming, the imagining ahead. He will touch me here, he will kiss me there. Her awareness that never before, not for anyone else, had she taken such pains -- a sign of the importance of this love: not the least part to be taken for granted. Sometimes her hand would tremble as she combed her hair, or she had to struggle with a button or a zipper. Sometimes she cried. Why did she cry? For happiness and for fear. In two more hours, in one hour, in less, I will see him. Between ecstasies, it was all waiting. Not once was one of them ever late for the other; neither ever forgot or canceled or postponed a date. Always there remained, despite their intimacy, a kind of formality between them. They would never reach a point -- would never be permitted to reach that point -- where they could become forgetful of each other, where one might take the other for granted. The bittersweetness of a love broken off before its time. So that decades later, looking into a mirror, combing her hair, she would recall, Never an unkind word.
    ""A strange love to measure future loves against. She would not exaggerate to the handful of people whom she would ever tell about him. She was proud always to have seen him clearly: an ordinary, decent man transfigured by grief. What was not ordinary was the depth of her feelings. What was miraculous was that those feelings should have been returned. How it had happened -- no one could have predicted it -- was a mystery, the everyday mystery of love. The knowledge from the beginning that their love was doomed -- there was a fatal flaw in it, the angels were against it, the gods would make sport of it -- gave unnatural poignancy to their time. Every hour together had the feel of being stolen. It was, one of the other of them said, like being caressed one moment and lashed the next. Always an air of the illicit and even of danger about their meetings -- as if at least one had been committing adultery, as if the price to pay might be blood. Without a word of explanation, from the beginning, it was understood: it would be a secret love.
   ""Looking back, she sees first of all her own lost youth: hardly more than a girl then, without much experience of life and none at all of love, Big Love, wasn't that what she used to call it? First love was what it had turned out to be. Two husbands and two children lay ahead. Sometimes he would say just this to her: ""You will marry and have children, and you'll forget all about me."" It was supposed to be a comfort to them both when he said that. And so he tried to smile. His melancholy smile. But he no more wished to be forgotten than she wished to forget him. Whenever they were together, she would stare and stare. He understood. He had just the same fear that one day her face would be just a blur to him. 
   ""He said, ""I feel as if I were doing something terrible to you -- to both of us -- but mostly to you. After all, I've been through so much, but you --"" But she protested. It seemed to her that already she had suffered more than most people her age. At which he grimaced and shut his eyes. It was one of the ways by which she knew she was loved. He could not think of her in pain. He said, ""I am afraid"" -- <i>I am afraid</i>: they said it to each other as often as <i>I love you</i> -- ""I am afraid one day you'll look back and see how young you were, and you'll be hard and bitter toward me, and you won't be able to forgive."" Now, <i>this</i> was pain. This vision of herself through his eyes, bitter, no longer young, and without him. This was pain. And he had placed a hand on either side of her face, gently tilted back her head, and wiped the tears away with his thumbs. For the rest of her life, in moments of grief, the memory of this gesture would come back. In the worst despair, just the memory could calm and comfort her. No other man's touch, ever, would mean more to her.""

"event","god. i haven't updated this thing in forreevveerrr. i'm soo bored though. like, my summer has been really boring. 'cause Nicole's in Maryland, and so I can't hang out with her. and Machi's in Japan. and Britney's in Myrtle Beach. so the only people i can hang out with are Jordan and Corey and Dana and Bo and stuffs. hopefully more often soon. 

so today was pretty boring. my mom couldn't sleep so she got me up at 9 to clean 'til 10, take a shower and get ready. we left at 10:30 to go to my cousin's soccer game, got outside and realized it was incredibly effin' cold and we were all dressed for regular SUMMER weather. so we dug around in the car for sweatshirts and shizz 'cause we were already running late. we got there and set up camp next to my aunt and uncle and watched the game, which they didn't keep score for. so then we left and went to barnes and noble to get my book for my summer assignment  (which is absolutely horrible. it's supposed to be 10-20 pages long). they were out of it. so we had to put in an order for another one, which is supposed to come in later in the week. i needed more to read, so i got Pet Sematary by Stephen King and Invisible Monsters by Chuck Palahniuk 'cause i absolutely loved Fight Club when I read it over spring break. and then we tried to find something for my sister to read. the test at the end of the year said she had a 5th grade reading level, but she reads like, Dr. Seuss. she refuses to read books appropriate for her reading level. so i was getting really frustrated and so was my mom. we finally got her to get some book about a runaway slave i'd never heard of, and then she wanted His Dark Materials trilogy, which my mom let her get despite my protests that it'd be over her head, and my mom made her get The Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, which she has already decided she will hate. so then we went to Wal-Mart to get some groceries and i was getting fed up because my mom kept getting all fat-free, sugar-free stuff and i swear that stuff mostly tastes like shit. and so i got my strangest nostalgic comfort food ever... flavored cream cheese. i swear, it's really good. i used to eat it with a spoon straight from the container. mmmmm, yummy. anywho. so then we came home and i wrapped jordan's present which he already knows what is, and now i'm waiting to go to his party. it's just his family, but whatever. i'm kinda nervous 'cause i wanna make a good impression and everything but he says not to worry. i feel better about giving him my present though 'cause he said just to give it to him when we're alone, so i'll be more comfortable with that. 

speaking of jordan, we took him out for his birthday last night to Macaroni Grill. my family and i, that is. i thought it was gonna be horrible 'cause my parents got us all at the same table, but it turned out okay. my family was nice. ^^ but then i wanted to kill my dad 'cause he went to LOWE'S. i was like, oh my god. 'cause we still had jordan and all... but it was actually kinda fun. we went and played with the paint thingy, and then we walked up and down all the aisles. and then we looked at wallpaper. and then we took him home. it was fun. 'cause, i wanted to do something with him 'cause his family had left him at home alone on his birthday. they went to the reds game. 

so yeah, that's been my weekend so far. tomorrow is the odyssey party, which should be fun."

"event","Sooo. With nothing else to do but sit here and look pretty while I wait for a stupid car search to load, I'm gonna tell y'all about my day. =D I'm sure you're excited. Mr. Johnson is such an idiot. I swear, that kid. Yeah, he's a kid. 'cause he doesn't know what he's talking about. So today he starts in on some big abortion rant. He's like, ""I mean, the *some weird name, but it's basically the morning-after pill*. That would be a hard decision to make, because, if your constituents want it, but then, you know it's morally wrong, and since it'd be killing babies, and make it easier to have an abortion."" I'm like, ""...effin' IDIOT."" Yeeaahh. And then he pretty much villified liberals. He said something like, ""If you're of a liberal mind, you tend to go with your constituents, and then if you're more moral minded you do the right thing and sacrifice your job for what's right."" I seriously wanted to go punch him. Like, sitting here thinking about it I am sooo mad. Like, Nicole and I were talking about it and seriously... just... yeah. I made a list for her of observations I had during that class. It was hysterical, she was cracking up. I'm gonna get it back from her in 6th period and post it. Ohyeah, and during his whole ""liberals are evil, conservatives are political martyrs"" speech, I wrote the observation ""Who decides what's morally right? It's not a definite thing."" Uuugghh. He pisses me off so much. Ohyeah, Observation #14 was ""Big words confuse him"". Seriously. Whenever he tries to use a word that's more than two syllables, he gets confused and stumbles over it. It's funny, but sad.

I HATE HIM"

"event","So yeah. Today = fun until after dance. First period we did a lot of stuff with Animal Farm, and <b>I actually participated in the big group discussion</b>! I was so proud of myself. I was all like, ""I dunno. I associated Moses' coming back with the pigs getting more like human beings than ever, because like, he left when Jones and his wife left, but then just when the pigs are like, wearing the ribbons and getting animals to bow to them and stuff, he comes back. *shrug*"" It was fun. 

And then we did a court case synopsis in Government for 2 cases: The Tinker Case and the Skokie Case. In the first one, these kids in the 60s wore black armbands to school to protest the Vietnam War, and the school banned them, so the parents took it to the Supreme Court and they ruled it unconstitutional. Thanks to them, we students have real rights even though we're under 18. And then in Skokie Case, this gorup of American Nazis in the 70s wanted to march around the town, but the town didn't want them too, so they put in all these laws that made it impossible for them to, and when they protested against it, they made it illegal for them to do it in the way they'd planned. So the Supreme Court ruled that they had the right to express their opinion and the Illinois State Court overturned the laws and stuff.

And then CTA and Biology was boring. French we did a word search, and I moved and everything and so we were like, sharing answers. It was great. And then I turned around and Zac and I were looking at the anorexic celebrities in Jennifer's magazine. ""How the heck do they get that skinny? You can see all of their bones!"" ""That's what happens when you stop eating."" I am faarrr from becoming anorexic. I eat a ton. Hee. And then Math was confusing at first, but then I got it. =D And I did our homework in like, 10 minutes. I rock guys. 

And at dance we were just messing around a ton. I /think/ I saw that cute guy from the dance there, and I think he might've said hi to me, but the music started so I'm not really sure, and then I was like, ""Awdamn."" 'cause it was hip hop. Which would definitely make me look like an idiot for saying I can't dance. Well at least I'm good at it. *sigh* Annnnyyyyywwhhoooo...

That's all folks! <3 Bethy"

"event","It makes me very sad when I have nothing at all to do but homework. So... I'm gonna update my LJ. =D So today was pretty fun. I woke up kinda late and so I missed my bus by like, 5 minutes and my dad took me to school. And I did my English homework. And then I went to Nicole's seminar 'cause she was being lazy and didn't want to walk to mine. And then in English I wrote my effin' hand off. ;_; But I think I did pretty well on my quiz. ^^ And most other classes were boring... 

Biology test was really really easy. I dunno why everyone thought it was hard. One or two questions were worded kinda strange, but other than that it was easy. *shrug* Then French was pretty stupid. Mrs. Naziripour kept talking in French and no one would shut up. It's not that hard to understand her. And if you shut up, she'll talk in English. *eye roll* That class pisses me off now that I have the seat from hell again. Then math was just boring. I wanted to fall asleep.

Then I came home, went jogging, went to my scheduling meeting, got all my shizz signed off, went to eat and it took forever. Then we went on an effing quest to get my sister a CD that wasn't even out yet. Got home, I got online. *sigh*

That was my day.

On a side note, if anyone wants to see me dance and hasn't done so yet, this Friday is our last basketball game, sooo. Now or never. And there's gonna be a casual dance after the game, I dunno if I'm going yet, but if enough people come and wanna go to the dance I might.

"event","So I'm totally gonna make a list of things I hate. Because I want to. =D

Country music. Fat. Banjos. The color yellow. Really bright sunlight. Humidity. Crusty milk. That annoying scraping sound the straw makes when it scrapes the side of the Icee cup. Mullets. Plaid. Math. Boys. Broken hearts. Unrequited love. The Old Man and the Sea. When the ice cubes grate against each other in your glass and make that werid sound. My little sister. Sluts. Whores. My feet. My thighs. Tights. Baby I'm A Star. Rap music. Girls who steal boyfriends. Snobs. Capris that are too long on me. Homework. Stupid teachers. Kids who are complete jerks. Being shy and people I wanna get to know. Losing touch with people. Life.

And I'll stop there, 'cause I feel like that too. 

So I'll tell the story of my desk in French.
So I moved seats a few days ago because my other desk randomly disappeared. It reappeared today, but I have no desire to move back to the seat from hell. It was completely isolated from anyone else, a row above everyone else, and right next to Ms. Nazipour's desk. So I slunk off to a desk in the very back, opposite side of the room, right next to this freaking amazing boy Zac and diagonal from Nicole. So anyway. I sit at this desk now, and it's got this drawing of a chicken on it. Well, I think it's a chicken. It's got like, a spiked collar, and it used to have a Gonzo nose. I asked wth was wrong with its nose, and I guess the person fixed it. Well the next day I came in, it had another chicken drawn there, and a huge argument between two people about the chicken, and song lyrics written all along one edge, and then the top corner. There was a bunch more on there too, but I don't wanna go into elaborate detail. So I'm reading it today and Zac leans over and taps me on the arm, and holds out his eraser *one of those clicky ones in a pen* and asks if I want to use it to erase my desk. And so I did. =D 

And then in my desk in math, someone wrote ""I <3 Brad"" on it, and I kinda laughed, and the next day it was ""I <3 *someone else, I forget the name*"" and I just laughed at that one too, and colored in the heart or something. The next day it had ""I <3 NO ONE"". And I felt sad for the person, so I erased ""no one"" and wrote ""you"", so it read ""I <3 you"". And then today I walked in and someone had written ""I love you?"" on the desk. So I answered ""Heckyes you do."" 

It's fun."

"event","Yeah. My school's was a while ago, but I just went to the homecoming of the highschool where all my friends go *if you didn't know, we moved 3/4 of the way through my 8th grade year*. And it was great. Just great. Some of the people I have known for forever barely acknowledged me, but Eric liked, attacked me with a hug. xD And he still smells good *swoon*. Anywho, there was also a breakdancing circle, and there was this one /really/ /really/ good guy, and one kid that I knew, Steven. And they were amazing.. And Katie came! Katie = my junior friend who goes to the School For Creative and Performing Arts. And anyway, they played the chicken dance, the hokey pokey, and YMCA in a row, and Ellie, Corey, and I were dancing, and Steven and his friend came up and started dancing with us, and so did Julia. It was awesome. And Jesse is a dick. At least he acknowledged me. *eye roll* And then we left, and Corey and I got Starbucks. Yummy! I'm so living at her house this summer. There is a Starbucks, Borders, NY & Co. , Banana Republic, and Panera within walking distance. But anywho, that was homecoming. And now my feet hurt 'cause I like to pretend I'm a normal height when I get the chance."

You know that ideal love that each of us dreams of from childhood? That's you!
Not because you posess all of the ideal characteristics, but because you are a savvy shape shifter.
You have the uncanny ability to detect someone's particular fantasy... and make it you.

You inspire each person to be an idealist and passionate, and you make each moment memorable
Even a simple coffee date with you can be the most romantic moment of someone's life
By giving your date exactly what he or she desires, you quickly become the ideal lover.

Your abilities to make dreams come true is so strong, that you are often the love of many people's lives.
Your ex's (and even people you have simply met or been friends with) long to be yours.
No doubt you are the one others have dreamed of... your biggest challenge is finding *your* dream lover.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>"

Last night I went to the Young Life fundraiser banquet, and it was pretty fun. I was like, one of the only teenagers there (everyone else was an adult), but oh well. And then afterwards, Summer went to find one of the leader-type people from Ryle, but he was a student, or whatever, and my mom and I ran into Sarah Goy. And we talked to her for a while, and she left to go get some food (she hadn't eaten since 11, lunch at school), and so then she offered to give me a ride to Club on Wednesday. And yeah, then we left. And we went to Bruster's, down the road from my house, and I got a Blast (like the equivalent of a DQ Blizzard), and it was sooooo good. Mmm, I won't be able to touch a Blizzard anymore. And they're putting in a Graeter's soon too! =D

And anyway, we're doing Hey Bitty tonight for Senior Night. It'll be fun. Except for the half-sliding thingy on the track. That won't be fun. Especially if it rips my pants. Then it won't be fun at all. But yeah. We're wearing our hair in pigtails. And pigtails are freakin' awesome. They're like a party for your head."

"event","Yeah. I've gotten fed up with all of those 'do this to be a good boyfriend' and 'do this to win a girl's heart' lists, so I've made one of my own. About me. 

10 Things A Guy Could Do To Win My Heart

10. Send me a bouquet where each type of flower meant something specific that was applicable to our relationship. So, don't just randomly get flowers, or get all roses or something. Put some thought into it.
9. Since my ideal guy would be an artist of some sort, it would win me over if he made a piece (poem, song, painting, drawing, sculpture, etc.) that was inspired by me. Not /for/ me that. That's cheesy. But inspired by me.
8. Take me someplace really unique and romantic for our first date. Like an art exhibit, or a picnic in the park. 
7. Be genuinely interested in learning about me and doing things that I like doing. I'd do the same for you. 
6. Don't always agree with me. Provoke debate, but intelligent debate. Be educated. Know what you're talking about. Stupidity is the biggest turn-off ever.
5.  Write me love letters/notes in a different language, and then read them to me out loud at some point. I just find that incredibly romantic. It'd be nice if the language was a Romance language: French, Spanish, Portugese, Latin...
4. Take me to a musical or a ballet. 'Nuff said.
3. Surprise me with a gift. Best example I can think of: One day over the summer, Jordon's boyfriend came to dance practice with a bouquet and gave it to Jordon. Completely out of the blue, completely unexpected. I thought that was really sweet.
2. Never. Never. NEVER do something incredibly ""romantic"" like serenade me in public. Unless you are a rising star in the music world and have had voice lessons, don't. No one wants to hear you sing, much less me.
1. Cuddle with me. Please. Hold me and play with my hair when I'm tired, put your arm around me when we're sitting by each other, hold my hand when we're walking around. I'm a cuddlebunny. =)

And because Tim wanted me to make it so you'd tag people... 

I tag Tim, Corey, Bo, Ellie, and Stacey. But you don't have to do it if you don't want to."

Tell twenty things about you that others might not know, then tag five people to do the same.

2. I'm scared of thunderstorms.
3. I kinda don't wanna go to homecoming...
4. I don't think I'm good enough to be a writer.
5. I hate Kentucky.
6. I cry myself to sleep sometimes.
7. I want to live in a huge Victorian mansion when I grow up.
8. I think I might be bipolar.
9. I hate people, but love humanity.
10. I listen to classical music when I go to sleep.
11. In 6th grade, my closest friend was an internet friend.
12. Sometimes I'll suddenly get really sad, and nobody used to notice, but now they do.
13. I think I'm over him, but the more I talk to him, the more I think I'm falling in love with him all over again.
14. All I really want is someone to hold me and tell me I'm beautiful.
15. I really like the taste of wine.
16. I sometimes imagine what it'd be like if I just walked out my front door with the laptop and my favorite books and never looked back. 
17. I wish I were beautiful.
18. When I read the stuff on PostSecret, some of them are just like me.
19. I wish I could tell someone all of my secrets, but I'm afraid what they'd think of me.
20. My greatest fear is that I'll end up alone.

~Stockholm Syndrome, by Muse~

No, this isn't a real update. Just letting you all know that I'm in love with this song.

i can't remember when it was good
moments of happiness elude
maybe i just misunderstood

all of the love we left behind
watching the flash backs intertwine
memories i will never find

so i'll love whatever you become
and forget the reckless things we've done
i think our lives have just begun
i think our lives have just begun

and i feel my world crumbling
I feel my life crumbling
i feel my soul crumbling away
and falling away
falling away with you

staying awake to chase a dream
tasting the air you're breathing in
i know i won't forget a thing

promise to hold you close and pray
watching the fantasies decay
nothing will ever stay the same

all of the love we threw away
all of the hopes we cherished fade
making the same mistakes again 
making the same mistakes again

i can feel my world crumbling
i can feel my life crumbling
i can feel my soul crumbling away
and falling away
falling away with you

all of the love we've left behind
watching the flash backs intertwine
memories i will never find
memories i will never find

Today I had a dentist appointment to get a tooth pulled. It was my last baby tooth, and the permanent tooth was coming in above it and I went and got it pulled, then went to dance. I was a little late, and missed a hard combination (yesss) we were doing for practice. And then we learned the rest of Aerosmith Mix, practiced Hollaback Girl once, and left. And I spent the rest of the day being annoyed by my cousins. Yay.

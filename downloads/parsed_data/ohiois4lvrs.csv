"event","today was alright. it has it's ups and downs like everyother day. acutally i was having a really good day which is kinda unusual...but then towards the end it kinda started to suck again...for one thing i got sick, and the worst part it i'll most likely feel better by tomorrow and have to go to school. anyways i don't feel like putting a poem on here so i'm going to write lyrics. 


""She's The Blade"" by SUGARCULT

Don't you make a move tonight
You can only stagger
Once shes got you in her sight
You're the one shes after

Shes the blade and you're just paper
You're afraid cause shes got closer
You're back-steppin and she's back-stabbing everything in your life

She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back
She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back

One by one you count the fights
Doesn't even matter
That shes got you by surprise
Misery's your master

Shes the blade and you're just paper
You're afraid cause shes got closer
Your back-steppin and shes out wrecking everything in your life

She stole everything your heart desired 
Now you want it back
She stole everything your heart desired 
Now you want it back

She stole everything
She controlled everything
She stole everything
She controlled everything

Shes the blade
Shes the blade
Shes the blade and you're the paper
Shes the blade and you're just...

Shes the blade and you're just paper
You're afraid cause shes got you closer

She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back
She stole everything your heart desired
Now you want it back

She stole everything 
She controlled everything
She stole everything
And controlled everything"

"event","yeah boring day. um it was really really stressful and i'd put full details but not that many people read this site or probably do just don't really care. so yeah leave comments sometime if you are reading this. make me feel special! well i have another poem. and after i wrote this poem during math it was then that i realized how much i despise that class. 

CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME?
what do you do when the ones you love
want you to chose?
how do you handle it?
how many tears do you need to cry?
how many scars do you have to make?
how many friends do you have to lose?
and how many people do you hurt?
because i have no clue how to handle it
and i'm afraid to cry
and i would run out of places for the scars
and i don't want to lose anybody
or watch them get hurt
so hat do you do when the ones you love
want you to chose?
can somebody tell me?
because i have no clue. 

yeah that's my beautiful poem! yup lovely. yeah i have nothing better to say now so i'm going to put some pretty pictures!

"event","yeah this is my first live journal entry. yay me! okay yeah i have nothing better to put so i am going to put one of my poems. yeah i know...thrilling. the poem doesn't even have a name yet but hey i wrote it myself at 12 at night so gimmie a break. 

you say that i'm special
you say that i'm sweet 
but your words go right through me
houw can you say those nice things about me
when all of the world
seems to disagree?
you say that i'm pretty 
you say that i'm smart
but your words seem to have left me in the dark
how can you not just let me be
when all of the world 
is ignoring me?
you say that you love me 
you say that you'll stay
but your words are just that...words
how can you mea all those things you say
when all of the world
is so far away?

yes pretty i know. i am extrememly tired. they made my dosage not as strong for my medicine but it still makes me tired. oh and just wait till it wears off....hehe. and i have a dashboard confessional song stuck in my head. woah that doesn't happen often. well yeah i am going to go now. bye bye!"

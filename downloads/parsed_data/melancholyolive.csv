"event","So yesterday, I was driving home from school, a little late because I was working on my senior page, and this blue car in front of me was starting to piss me off with their awful driving. Then the car turns on it's left-turn signal and after a good while, merges into the right lane, and then just leaves their signal on. Well I'm not describing it well, but I was wondering what kind of an idiot was driving that car, so as I pass, I look over and notice Brenda Brock, on her cell phone @_o!"

I didn't end up like he did though, I couldn't believe it, he had to go to the hospital today, his tonsils had absessed, so they had to lance them to release the pus, and he passed out so they revived him by hitting his chest or somethin, craziness eh? And pretty gross, ohwells, hopefully I'll be better tomorrow."

<P>Anyway, I start working next week on spec sheets, lables, samples, swatches, shipping, you name it, whatever a design intern does. It'll be fun, but I wish I could work down in the market. Not only does my dad need me for when it gets really busy in July, but sice I'm going away I can't really get a job down there, they kind of want you for the whole summer. Not to be complaining, I mean I get to go to china which is awesome, but&nbsp;I wish I could do both. Or maybe work at Anthropology to get the employees discount on their adorable clothes! </P>"

"event","Oh Dear lord, I just checked my email, and realized that I forgot to attach the history Q's in my email, I was about to die of shame, of all the stupid things I've done, this was the most embarrassing, the most pathetic, the most hopeless, single handedly screwing over any one who was relying on me for the Q's, and making my hopelessness clear to most of our class. But then I realized that Aaron Goodman had gotten the attachments, because he finished formatting them and sent them around, so I finally figured out that I sent 2 emails, one with the attachments, one without, but I didn't send the one with attachments to my class, so if Aaron hadn't I'd still have screwed over my class. Thank god, but it's still hella embarrassing, you can imagine how red I got. 

at least I'm getting over my sore throat, just in time for finals, yay, but not. 


Aaaaaaaaaaaag, I'm such an idiot, I want to sink into a whole, on top of that I always ramble in emails, I try to explain things, and it goes alll over, and I was so out of it when I sent the email, I realized all of the sudden, nevermind, this is why I kept reminding myself not to write an entry last night. When I'm tired, not exhausted, but mentally drained, I act like a little kid, I scowl at things and shuffle around in my blanket and bite things, mainly myself because I'm right there, and I say everything on my mind.

anyway, the cutest thing ever happened to me today and I'm not gonna tell you what it is, but ah, I just want to keep him forever!"

"event","<P>Nate's been into world of warcraft for a while, and yesterday he helped me set up my own character (he was teaching me how to play). The game has such pretty graphics! Anyway so we were trying to come up with a name, and most people take names from book characters or from another language, so I was thinking since I usually use something with olive in it, why not orribu (olive in japanese). So we were making jokes about it, orribu-chwan (from something you wouldn't know) and stuff, but it wasn't long enough for me, so I was thinking omochikaeri ('take out' or literally 'take home' in japanese), another one I've used before. So we were having some fun with that, and then I was trying to think of the funniest japanese word I know so I said to Nate 'there's a word for to die while having sex in japanese' so he says 'do it', sot that's my characters name, and now I can't help cracking up when anyone in the game says my name. </P>

At the beginning of the week I was eating cake and edamame for breakfast, but we ran out of cake, so it was just edamame. Surprisingly, I'm not sick of it yet, well it's been my staple food for a while, but it's just been bad lately, because I've been sitting home alone the whole time, and I don't have the time or motivation to cook anything from scratch when it's just for myself, so I just ate edamame.

"event","My mom is in love with her new prius, seriously, they are having a very steamy affair. Although, she did take her lesbian lover to the opera today, very coincidentlly the same showing that my class was going to. My mom is ridiculous and crazy, but I love her all the more for it. She said people think that Carmen and her are ""lesbian lovahhhhhs"", and the guy who sold her the Prius gave her an extra plate of brownies to bring to her 'friend' because he thought my mom would be seeing her later XD (apparently his wife makes a brownie plate for everyone who buys a car from him @_@). 

This isn't an uncommon on her side of the family though, my Grandpa, my large, gruff, sarcastic italian grandpa, and his best friend pretend to be a gay couple for kicks sometimes. They go to department stores and look at linens, or look at cars together, and stuff like that. I so can't see my grandpa doing that, but cool anyway!

Ah, the opera. It was pretty good, though apparently last time it was her they had elaborate sets and costumes. This time it was pretty bare, but they did a good job using lights and dry ice to create a set. Oh and randomly, I was talking to the senior Shyam, and he asked me if I knew Jimmy because Jimmy had said that he knew me. Apparently Shyam has known Jimmy a long time. I wonder why Jimmy never mentioned that, or maybe he did, my memory sucks."

Apparently for it to get to this certain level of awards, you have to sell it to them, but I didn't say it was for sales, so it leaves me wondering. You know?

<P>The Trip; </P>
<P>I went on college visits this past week, to the east coast where it's bitter cold, and there's dirty sluch every where. Well NY was awesome of course, but poughkeepsie is the worst place ever, Northhampton is adorable, and Boston would've been awesome too if I hadn't spent half the time lost, sick, and in big puddles of dirty slush. It was just so nice to be back in Seattle in light unrestrictive clothing. The air is warm and smells of spring and earth, and the rain is so nice. We stayed with Mary in NY, and we all went to see the Christo gates which were quite pretty, but i could see why some people found them unremarkable. Well orange is one of my favorite colors (orange and green) so it was cool, and I got fun swatches of the fabric! I chased down the some guys to get them, it was fun. The highlight of the trip of course though, was Spamalot! Monty Python and the Holy Grail on Broadway! Ah! So hilarious, and such great actors! It was cool because they performed it in a small theatre and Mary scored us awesome close seats! Besides, the actors did a sing along with the audience at the end XD. They did a really good job of including the audience. They also did a great job of altering in from a movie to a musical, they kept enough of the original, but not so much that the new stuff didn't fit, and htey put their own twist on it all, well after all, Eric Idle wrote it so no wonder. </P>
<P>Colleges; </P>
<P>School wise I learned a lot on the trip. Barnard was not for me, not that I was expecting it to be, it was to small, homogenous and so mawkishly stuck up in the ivy-esque way. I still love NYU, though we didn't get to got to an info session or tour because it was during ther weekend. I learned that FIT is really not a school you go to to further your general education, they pretty much want to get you out in the bussiness world fast, no wasting time learning anything outside of the specific area you choose, not ever related topics. Parsons was cool though, but I didn't get any real feeling for it, so I have to look into it further. I didn't think I'd like Smith, a small-ish all girls school in a little town in Massachusetts was everything I disliked, but it ended up being really cool. The size was nice, the town was cool, the sense of community was great, they had an awsome museum, etc. Brown I knew nothing about, but my mom wanted me to do an overnighter there, pretty much, Brown sucks, the kids don't socialize with each other much, they don't do much besides study, get drunk/high, or sit in the cafeteria. RISD on the other hand was such an awesome school with really chill people, but again, they require too much specialization for my taste, I want to learn so much, I don't want to decide my carreer path now. anyway, for now I just want to be young and careless Claire, we need to do something now this weekend think about it! heheheheheh (evil laugh (maybe)) I really want to make another cake with rainbow sprinkle frosting, that was hella good! </P>
<P>BTW, <STRONG>JC </STRONG>(if you're active on lj anymore),&nbsp;my dad and I were at a Mexican restaurant today, and I saw on the alcohol menu; Tequila Sunrise, and it just reminded me of you and ethan and andrew and allison and everyone, damn, I miss you guys!

We rented a house this time and it was gorgeous, isolated somewhat, surrounded by snow and trees with a view to the mountains and the fog in the valley below. It was especially gorgeous at night after everyone went to bed and all the lights were off, the blue light seeped into the scene like&nbsp;a filter on the world making the snow that&nbsp;washed out almost violet blue&nbsp;and the trees dark against it. </P>

"event","I'm starting to worry about my weight. I can't gain any, seriously, I can eat like crazy, but I won't gain a thing. I seem to be steadily losing a lb a week (not sure how often I weigh myself). So far I've dropped from 130 to 122 which may not seem like that much, but the thing that scares me is the gradual decline. I think it's because we only eat a proper dinner about twice a week. Most nights I heat myself up leftovers or canned soup, or like last night I made eggdrop-udon. Ever since Nate left, and Mom started working, she's stopped bothering to cook often. My dad doesn't eat meat, and since it's just me now, she doesn't think it's worth it to make a dinner and an alternative dish, so a lot of times my dad will make lentil and spinach soup or something. 

My stomach isn't even used to eating a lot anymore, so when we had everyone from Thailand (and Gordon from Hong Kong) over, Gordon was telling me to eat more and that dieting was bad. Although I protested that I wasn't dieting, Gordon wouldn't believe me. I managed to force down a couple more bites of rice. But maybe he was just being like that, because I ate barley green steamed dumplings and soup from Shainghai Garden, halibut, crab, and then most of a bowl of rice. 

Tonight was another off meal because I stoped by my mom's office on the way home. The bank for some reason wouldn't let me cash my pay check, or check it and then withdraw it (b/c I'm a minor or some shit like that), so I needed my mom to come with me to get some of it. Unfortunately I forgot my bank book and all, so I just dragged her shopping with me for x-mas gifts. I ended up only getting 1 thing, b/c my mom takes forever to do anything with, and then we ate dinner at the Il Fornao cafe. I don't like them much anymore, b/c they got rid of their yummy ham and cheese croissant sandwiches. Ah i love hamd and cheese croissants!

Olivia's fav things (off the top of her head)
ham and cheese croissants
witch hazel
chocolate pudding
the smell of pine
little kids
fires
the smell of our garage
chocolate milk
cuddling
hugs
flanel
my polarfleecy blanket
my friends (como no?)
Claire's faces when she gets flustered
falling leaves
snow
puffs of breath
jasmine scents (can't find a good one for a price I'd pay the van cleef and arpel limited edition something or other is over $50, which for a perfume, I couldn't pay, I searched through all the perfume counter's I saw in Hong Kong, Thailand, the airports, Nordstrom, I even went in Sephora, nobody has good jasmine scents at a price I'm willing to pay! I do like the Bvligari white tea too, but whenever I found it it was always atleast $55)

If these things remind you of the winter, well that's b/c that's what I'm thinking of now, a list I write in the summer would be at least 50% different ^_^"

anyway, hannukah party yesterday was a bit of a mess for me b/c I thanked the wrong person for the gift. Arg, it's just that our friends used all the same wrapping paper for their gifts, and the one I got had different paper. On top of that it just said ""from the Wennets"", there were two Wennet families, andc the handwriting didn't look like Andrea's, so I figured it was from her sister in-law. Whoops.

Gordon, the crazy gift giver (he owns a cloth factory my dad works with) is here again, he brought me a gift, and one part was this cute little teddy bear cellphone-keychain that lights up and says 'smooch, I love you' when you press it xD. The guys from the factory my dad uses in Thailand are visiting, so we have the house all done up for them. Our christmas tree, garlands, stockings, lights, nice plates and silverware, etc. so my mom had me outside sweetping up the porch and walkways and then I scraped the moss off the concrete steps. 
I'm so tired now, and my rooms a mess, I've been sleeping in the library bed on weekends anyway. I'll steal my bro's flanel sheets tommorow for my bed.

Anyway, happy holidays, whichever you celebrate or choose not to!"

"event","<P>Eh, it's been a while. I'm heading of to Thailand and I promised Ni I'd say goodbye, so bye bye Ni-chan! Today I wore the leopard print leg-warmers I made a while a go, fun fun! I can never sleep the night before a trip &lt;_&lt; . Oo, but I got that new Dispatch CD I've been waiting for, it was actually on sale when I went ot oick it up! Yayness! I love it to death and all. I forgot to do my spanish test corrections and math hw ahead b/c I won't be there monday and tuesday, so I'll try and do them tomorrow and take a picture and email it to them. The problem is, my brain doesn't work in the morning. I also have to fill out the application for the China trip before I get back, evil. Ah, I want to go on that trip so badly, that would just be the coolest thing ever. When we went to visit my brother last weekend at his college, I slept over one night. He was kinda trying to get me drunk, he wasn't trying hard, but he did try. I was so tired though, I was falling asleep, but I didn't want them to think I was really drunk and passing out or something, le sigh. </P>
<P>I got the model thing again today, a guy told me as he was getting off the bus, 'I'm not trying to be rude or pick you up, but you should try modelling before you're 22' Things like this always make me wonder, if it's not my looks, is it my personality? Ohwell, who cares anyway, it's such a hassle and rather time consuming. Why can't guys and girls just hang out, why does it have to be leading to something? </P>
<P>My parents are letting me continue sewing classes, but I couldn't make it this week, so I'll have a lot to catch up on. My dad's really excited about showing me the factories, it's so cute. I saw his planner open today to his pictures. It was so sweet, I didn't even know that dad kept a picture of us, but he has a ton of&nbsp; me and Nate, me and him. It was rather unexpected. </P>
<P>I really like the essay I wrote on <U>Tracks</U>, I haven't been able to do creative writing in a while because last year was all analytical. Mr Christensen's class is where creative essays go to die, but he's a great teacher and I like him. I used Lulu as my narrator though, so I was a little limited by having to use prose that's realistic for a five year old, even if she is unusually smart.</P>
<P>I haven't designed anything in a while either, I used to do it in class XD. in the margins of my notes,&nbsp;but now I can't because my teachers this year are all looking out for that. Freshman year I drew in Math and English, last year in history, and thins year, I haven't doen anything yet. It's really sad though. I just don't have any ideas. That's one of my greatest fears, that I'm going to not be able to be a designer because I won't be able to come up with ideas. Hopefully going to a design school will solve that. </P>
<P>Anyway, it's freezing cold, and fairly late, so I'm gonna try to sleep</P>
<P>When I get back I'll post some pics! x)</P>"

"event","<P>Wow, haven't posted in what seems like ages, even though I know it hasn't been that long. I've been so busy it's all been a blur these past couple weeks. Last week was the worst, I had SAT monday, tuesday, thursday, sunday, and on wednessday I had sewing. This means I got home at around 9-9:30 and then had to do my homework. It also meant that I ate cold takeout in the office or Tully's sandwiches, or cold bagels at SAT classes for dinner every night. This weekend I couldn't fall asleep till 4 every night, I would just lie there, that's what happens when I'm stressed. I</P>
<P>'m so tired of my family being gone too. I've decided to do my Dia de los defunctos (muertos) altar for my family. Basically, my dad was never around, that worked fine though, no complaints, but now my brother's gone, and my mom started working the same time Nate left. My parents work late too, they're the last people out everyday. They usually get home around 7. Well my mom does, my dad just got back from NY, Amsterdam, Italy, Hong Kong, and Bangkok last week, and I think he's leaving again soon, I don't even bother keep track. I ran into Laurence at the bus stop and practically dragged him onto the bus with me (he was waiting for a different one). I just miss people I guess. </P>
<P>The other thing is that I haven't gotten on im in so long, pretty much since the second week of school. Well I'm not sure, I've lost all track of time. I miss everyone. </P>
<P>So enough of my self pity, I was talking to Jimmy yesterday and senior projects came up. I'd never really heard about them at my school, so I assumed we didn't have them, but apparently they're optional. So, <STRONG>I'm gonna put on a fashion show! I'll make all my designs and have a photoshoot, compile a portfolio, and put on a show!</STRONG> It would be so awesome! I can barely even comprehend how amazing that would be. </P>

"event","Wandered down to my bro's apartment today, went on a cleaning frenzy. I miss that kid, he's such a happy person, he gets excited over everything, and then his excitement passes on to you, he made days fun. While I was cleaning I had a long phone conversation with Catherine, it was nice. I haven't seen her in a while, we just kinda talked about our lives, it was comfortable. Catherine and I, well, our relationship has been a bit off for a while, this time we just talked, I didn't worry about her or feel that I needed to do something. Recently I hadn't liked the way I acted with her, kinda like a parent. Our relationship's been off for a year or two now though. We kinda grew apart and now that we're through a large part of that, I think it's easier for us to hang out. 

Photo is a bit hard for me b/c I have trouble not seeing in color. Color is the thing I notice, it's an integral part of how I judge beauty, with black and white photo, it all turns to shades of gray. Color is my world. I love b&w photo, but I have so much trouble taking the shots."

I know I sound stupid complaining about it, but I really would be happier if they were a few inches shorter. I love my old jeans so much, they are perfect, comfy, long, fit well in legs and waist, flattering, nice looking, and they're a nice height in back so they don't go down too far when you sit. If they didn't have gaping holes at the knees (giant ones xD) I'd wear them forever. Sadness.</P>

"event","I wore a crazy outfit today just for kicks, and because I hadn't worn one yet. I love wearing crazy things, I ran into catherine downtown on my way home and we dropped by Urban Outfitters quickly, but I didn't really find anything and I was carrying a lot of heavy things. Oh yeah, I was downtown b/c I take the bus home now. Taking the bus on the freeway allways amuses me, you bounce the whole way. Not bumos, just bouncing the whole way which means for girls, you just jiggle the whole way. So after I left Urban, I caught the bus home and when I got back I was gonna go out and get started on my first photo assignment. Unfortunately it started to rain and then my mom called and said my aunt would be by to pick me up in 45 minutes. I had forgotten that we were going to house sit this weekend and my mom thought'd be fun for all of us (me, my mom, my aunt, and my two cousins) to go stay in the 2 room apartment. I just really didn't feel up for it today, I wanted to go take photos, make fried rice, kick off my shoes, and relax, but she wants to all go jam into this tiny apartment with me and my cousins on the florr that's too small to fit the three of us, and stuck with that parrot that will not shut up ever and bites people. Of course my cousin will want to pet it, and she'll get mad if we tell her he'll bite her b/c she thinks all animals are inherently nice. I know I'm being bitchy, but I don't want to be there tonight with all 5 of us in an apartment that hardly fits two. My cousins are way to energetic for a place  with no room, and I'm not up for the hassle of changing, packing, squiching in, and putting up with it all. If they stayed at our house it'd just be so much easier. I think it's just because fridays are my come home and crash days.

So excuse all my angsty ranting, I've actually been a lot happier lately. These past 2 years I've done nothing for myself it seems. I was just following the college path, that and eevrything I did was in Lakeside, and that's not a healthy environment to revolve your life around. So I dropped physics till next year and picked up photography, and I've signed up for sewing classes. I used to feel so empty when I wasn't doing something or talking to someone, just thinking, but now I don't feel that anymore."

"event","<P>I kinda hate being back at Lakeside, it's such a messed up school. People don't care about their lives outside of school, that or they pay little attention to them. It's not like you have a choice with our workloads. I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't really care about homework. I mean sure I do care, but I don't want to work that hard. I want to have fun, to do things I like, to do the things that give my life meaning. I don't want to go back to the point where I wondered what I was actually living for, where I could see nothing to look forward to. It's a little late now though, I've stuck it through and I only have one more year after this. Don't get me wrong, I love the kids, and I love the teachers, we have great teachers. I made a skirt friday, that's more what I want, to make things, to have fun, to do what I like and not hate myself for not caring as much about grades and school like everyone else does. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>wow, I'm so angsty and whiny, I should just shut up about it already. I miss everyone from Mexico, I wish there were kids like that at my school, actually I just wish everyone from Uninter went to my school xD </P>
<P>JC, move here and go to school with me! </P>

&lt;Zaratustra&gt; JAVA - DON'T USE IT
&lt;StarDonut&gt; Yeah, that's about right.
&lt;StarDonut&gt; Imagine C is a man, okay?
&lt;StarDonut&gt; Give him a fancy suit and cane and mess with his mind some until he is smarter but difficult to understand and useless for basic stuff now. Now he's C++.
&lt;StarDonut&gt; Now take a bat to his knees.
&lt;StarDonut&gt; Now he's Java.
&lt;StarDonut&gt; If you keep hitting him until he dies, he becomes applications with Java.

&lt;rarrfzerofEXE7&gt; ""You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese, the Swiss hold the America's Cup, France is accusing the U.S. of arrogance,

If I make it often I'm going to get obese, no really, I ate 3 giant helpings and some chicken for dinner and then some more for lunch today. My helpings are big too, my parents only needed half portions for dinner, but it's soooooooooooooooooo good! &gt;_&lt;</P>
<P>&nbsp;Didn't use your recipe though joe, it was a bit too vauge for an inexperienced person like me. I used http://www.recipezaar.com/38748, I just replaced the meat with chinese sausage, so for anyone who loves fried rice (besides joe b/c his is prolly better), try it. </P>

"event","Dropped Nate off at college, he'll like it there. He and his roomate have already hit it off. They biked to Good Will and bought $1 art for their room XD. The way back turned into a lecture from my parents on study habits and time management. It pisses me off so much, they seem to think that everything should be so easy for me once I take my medication, like it fixes all the problems. My Dad doesn't even think I need a break from studying, he thinks because I'm ""observant"" I can just look out the window for a break. They don't seem to realize how much stress there is, how hard Lakeside is. They think it's all just a matter of applying yourself, and if I were to try harder I'd get it. I know I don't try as hard as I could, but there's only so much someone can push themselves for better papers, better tests, better grades, till they lose their reason for living, their happiness. I reached that point last year, I didn't even have time to cry no matter how badly I wanted to because I didn't even have time to think about anything but work. On top of that I hated myself for not working harder. I'd feel guilty whenever I took a break to look outside, to check my email, to do something. My parents thought that my break was dinner while they interrogated me and expressed dissapointment and dissaproval at the rate of my progress. I never want to be there again."

made a skirt, well finished it (Claire helped too) but it kinda sucks, so I luckily I've signed up for basic clothing construction classes at Seattle Community College. Yay!

went to hood canal for extended family fun. Hood Canal is a place where you walk on oysters, and if you thrust your hand into the sand you come up with a handful of clams, so we had lot's of clams. Got nicely tanned down there too, hung out with Claire and then my big cousins who I rarely see. Hanging out with my big cousins and my brother meant lots of beer, drunk crabbing, and making fun of my brother while he's really drunk XD. On the ferry back from 'The Hood' the bauble on the end of my hair pin from one of our Japanese exchange students fell off T____T, it rolled of the ferry deck so I couldn't get it back, sadness.

My brother left for college today, well he's actually going one of the school outdoor trip they have so the new students can get to know each other. He never sold his car, so Mom said that if I sold it, I could keep the cash. It's not worth much, but I think I'll sell it and buy a nice camera. We'll see him again in 4 days when we go down to Oregon to drop of his stuff, but we prolly won't see him Thanksgiving b/c we're all going of to Thailand without him :0 :) ;)

It was a rather uneventful departure, prolly because I've already delt with his imminent departure, that or it hasn't kicked in yet. He wasn't really around this summer anyway, he was always working or at Joe's house."

"event","Last night my brother came home at around 1 and snuck into my room to ask if I wanted to watch TV with him like he used to. It was so cute I couldn't say no, so I went down, but after about a half hour he fell asleep as usual. I had a slight suspicion when he was watching the news past the time of the commercial break on the other shows, but once the comercials came on on the news chanel and he hadn't changed it I was sure. So sure enough I leaned over and his eyes were closed, so I turned of the TV, but then I didn't feel like going back upstairs so I slept on his couch with his extra blanket and pillow. He had to go to work in the morning though, so I didn't get to sleep in, and then my mom wouldn't let me go back to bed, she doesn't like it when I stay home, so she gave me a list of things to do around the house, empty the dishwasher, do the laundry, clean the basement, rake under the bushes, and clean around the house. The plus side is that she's paying me, which she wouldn't normally do for things like that, I guess it's because she gave me so much at one time. She's also getting my dad to pay me for the time I've worked for him, maybe I'll work some more then, I could really use the cash. 
After she left I tried to go back to sleep, but I couldn't, so I just layed there and listened to the rain. I know she doesn't like when I;m lazy, she wants me to be doing something, taking classes, working. That's fun too, but being home alone, gardening a little, talking to friends, reading, it's just so peaceful. If the sewing machin wasn't broken I might work on something. My mother pointed out that I'm not taking the initiative to do anything about becoming a designer, she's right, I'm not doing enough projects, I'm not taking classes, I'm not drawing much. I've always thought deep down that I'd never make it anyway, I'm not good enough, I don't have enough ideas, enough motivation, sure I enjoy it, but it isn't something I can have a careeer in. But if that's so, what do I do, I have nothing else I suppose. I just like clothes, I like shopping and dressing up and wearing crazy outfits, and just having fun with clothes. I have since I was little, I would spend hours as a little kid making clothes for my stuffed animals and hanging cloth differently to make different outfits. Maybe I'm just not as enthusiastic about it anymore, maybe it's ovver, or maybe I just need to take a class. I want to learn how to make clothes, take a patterns class, I think the problem is I'm not motivated enough, I haven't gotten out and searched for a class to take, I'm never motivated enough, it's a horrible thing and sometimes it makes me hate myself. I just enjoy life however it comes, I'm too passive, I'm always happy to be out with friends, but I don't usually take the initiative, I'm so tired of everything, I think I've fallen in another low-phase, I thought leaving for Mexico would help, but it was just a distraction. I'm happy, but at the same time I'm not, I don't even know why, or what's wrong."

"event","Ah, it's been so much fun here, though I am a bit tired of being here. When gringas go to clubs, much gropage ensues, so I could do without a bit of that, I{m so dissapointed I wasted almost 2 weeks by not going out, and now most of the people are gone, or they've moved buildings, but it's still fun, and although I'm ready to be home, I will miss it here. Sorry for the lack of posts, it's  bit hard to get on computers here, but I don't think you guys really missed them anyway. I still have the damn 10 oclock curfew, I tried staying out later one night, I got home by 1, and they were so worried, they had been searching the hospitals, and they called my friend in Mexico city, and he was praying for me. I felt like such a bitch, so from now on I will be good about my curfew and all, but it still sucks. I miss you all, and I'll see or talk to you soon as I'm getting back the 25th, though at midnight-ish, so really I'll be back the 26th.

Before I go, here are some haikus my friends Ethan and Andrew wrote while drunk;

Bring me my shotgun
The vodka is plentiful
I need more to drink

Chinga tu madre
Pinche cabron puto guey
Burro picante

Where is my barber?
We all want to be skinheads.
Bring me my razor!

Hand me my nose ring
Skanking into the spotlight
This is the night for dance

Pink in yellow light
Things are getting blurry now
I am so fucked up"

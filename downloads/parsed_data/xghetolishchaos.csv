"event","okay so i took a quiz and this is what i got .. damnnnn its like MAD weird cuz what it says about me is pretty much true. phew. here we go:

ESFP 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You're a fun-loving outgoing person and are naturally drawn to people...you are quite enthusiastic and exuberant...and usually well-liked by others.. you're good at meeting people and helping them enjoy themselves...you are sympathetic towards people and generous with your time and money. You wanna be where the action is and will see things in your own special way... 

You're aware what is going on around you and notice stuff that others miss. You're popular and gregarious and are often busy in social stuff...you are instigators of activity and like to be ""where the action is...""...you like laughing at yourself and others....you like to help others and often join organizations that letcha do that..if you work as a teenager, chances are that you'll take a job that lets you interact with others (gift shop, waiter, anywhere you can charm or shmooze)....you're ""on stage"" often... 

You're the eternal optimist, and always seem to land on your feet, somehow. (gee, all this stuff shows you might be good in the Storm Palace pubs..) you can interact with people of all ages, backgrounds or types with no problem.. you learn best when you can interact with others and DO things, not just observe or listen about 'em... Teachers are the key to your success.. they have to care about you for you to want to do well.. 

You don't like conflict or intellectual arguments...you don't like learning by sitting quietly by yourself and reading some boring abstract stuff...""how does it relate to my day-to-day life?!"" You know how to motivate others to get the job done...you can link together people and resources...you'd probably be happy being a coach or a receptionist or a therapist...anywhere you could help people and be responsive to 'em...you don't impose your will. 

You like teamwork...you can get caught up in others' emotions.. your style is inclusive and allowing others to participate in the decisions..you don't need to suck up all the glory...you like to take breaks and relax..you love being active and going out and doing things with friends... 

You're fun to be with and bring enjoyment to situations...you find fun in the moment...your friends are VERY important to you, and I'll bet you tell 'em so and let 'em know it somehow...you like to reach out and touch the lives of others...you like to share your values with those you love... you might move in or out of a relationship depending if it ""feels"" comfortable..you get kinda hampered with disapproval.. you can overwhelm your partner with all this affection and stuff...when there's a breakup, you can move on and get over it quickly, surrounding yourself with your friends... 

Be careful on these: don't spend too much time socializing and not enough on the task at hand. You'll probably talk on the phone rather than work. Also, don't forget to finish what you start..get some planning skills and time management...don't ignore the logical facts, as much as you'd rather go by subjective stuff...finally, don't be so action-oriented that you forget to plan ahead...

"event","OoOoKay .. first let me say AMEN cuz i took muh cornrows out lmao they were startin to irritate mee. Next umm last nite was awesome!!! 

So we didnt win .. but the talent on the last nite of ""Stars in Their Eyes"" was like DAMN. We did pretty good we got 114 points out of 150. I personally didnt really care that we didnt win or anything, i mean i didnt even wanna try out this year in the first place, but hey it was like a rockin event! 

OMG we went on after this girl who sang ""There You'll Be"" by Faith Hill, and dedicated it to her dad who died two years ago .. and while we were waitin backstage, we were all gonna cry .. but we couldnt cuz it would juss ruin everything. but it was MAD sad. i mean hella much of the audience were crying .. especially when during the song the girl broke down and was crying too. 

Umm .. India won .. she did that song by Randy Crawford, i unno what its called .. but WOW that girl has got the best voice EVER. i mean WAY better than britney's ... as strong as Christinas .. soul like Alicia's. its juss WOW. She won overall and shes way talented so its alllll good! And Martha won the scholarship to the stage school. That girl totally deserves it .. she's so small tho lol its so cute. but her voice is mad strong too. GOODNESS so much talent at muh school i feel like mad inferior lmao!

Oh and by the way .. i called anthony before the show started to ask if he was coming .. when really i wanted to ask about that ""nameless"" guy .. but i chickened out. so now anthony must really think im a wiErDo[which i AM lmao] and i juss made an ass of myself. RAHHHHH! 

annneeewaiiiise ... i didnt get tix to Will's, Gareth's, and Zoe's tour in October. DAMMNIT. BOO on them. lol i wanted to go! *pouts* i swear i needta turn will straight .. cuz gay is just not workin out for me and him .. OBVIOUSLY lol. nah gay is cool .. but i mean hello why does he have to be so HOT?! so SWEET?! so TALENTED?! so PERFECT?! ahh theres the mistake...he's too perfect to be straight. dammnit lmao 

Next .. umm Mair called me this morning [damn her she woke me up at like 8:30am lol] and that REALLY surprised me. cuz i wrote her a letter like a month ago .. and i hadn't gotten the letter back, so i thought .. hey thats great, she forgot about me. im not even worth writin back to. Then i get a call from her today. and i was like WOOO lol. i unno i was doubtin our friendship .. especially when she used to be my best friend. I mean yeah i do still consider her and the rest of LOC my best friends .. but in a wierd way .. i technically have no best friend. not even here in the UK. Just really good friends yanno? But its all good, cuz im copin on my own .. and i know ill find another best friend that will become as close to me as LOC used to be. 

anneewaiiise .. guess what mair let me know. BARRY and her are together....since easter. WOW huh? i mean im not that surprised .. and im not worried for her at all .. i mean i know barry .. and he has ALWAYS treated his girls with so much respect. And i trust him to take care of Mair. He will. So she's happy, he's happy, and i'm happy for them. But supposedley he's as tall as i am now, which is like DAMN YOU. lmao he used to be maddd shorter than me!  Okay umm so me and mair have been catchin up .. i told her about that ""nameless"" guy and shizzle .. and we joked around like old times. Oh yeah and the rest of LOC and michelle are finally TOTALLY COOL WITH EACH OTHER. yayy i mean FINALLY dudes! This summer SHOULD rock cuz all 7 of LOC are gonna be together. and that has NEVER happened. So itll be ... interesting. but im not shure if everything will work out the way mair thinks it will. She's sooo sure that everything will be just perfect. and i didnt tell her .. but im worried itll be all wierd and shit. i hope not tho. whatever. im supposed to hit her back today....

so thats it for now. and umm i put some of my polaroids up on my picture trail site .. i still needta get the actual camera film developed. and i added sum other pix too. but theyre pretty cool pix .. i mean i liked my costume lol okay peacey outie ..."

"event","life sucks. people suck. friends suck. feelings suck. 

i hate it in this damn place. i was truly for the first time since i've moved to London .. HAPPY. wow. surprise eh? i was HAPPY and content in living here. content with the way my life was going. content with my family and my friends. [ignoring a few problems] but i shouldve known THAT wouldnt have lasted long. yeah cuz it ended yesterday. 

WoOoO i should be grateful that i WAS happy here for at least 7 days. dude how great was that? but now. i hate it here more than i ever did before. i wish i wasn't here... anywhere.. ANYWHERE but here. funny how wishes never come true rite? 

i have never EVER missed my old life and the bay area so much, not since when i first moved here anyway. it's funny how my dad didnt move at all. how i really couldve stayed in the bay area. how i couldve grown up with my childhood friends, stayed with the most important person...now two most important people in my life .. my two neices. well whats done is done. and i cant cling to the past. but id give ANYTHING to move back. to be surrounded by people who love me...people who don't make me cry. whatever. i miss LOC. no matter what, mair, momo, les, chelle, meelee, and jenn will always stay true to themselves .. stay true to our friendship...as best as they can. and i love em. 

lifes a bitch. life lets u think everything is SO well..and lets you be happy. then BAM. plunge all the way down to the bottom. where you feel like shit. where you ARE shit. life is a freakin roller coaster .. one i wanna get off of. 

why is it that i'm made to feel bad for making new friends .. 

why is it that i'm the one who's become the resident punching bag .. 

whatever. i'll get over this. i'm prolly just caught up in my emotions right now. but i had to vent sumhow. 

oh yeah and HAPPY EASTER everyone. lol have a good one. 

p.s. les, thanks for listenin to me for like 2 hours. my phone bill ahhhh lol. we're both dorks. but ur a poundcake. heehee. i love you gurl. thanks for being there. 
also. thanks vicki for everything. you have truly been an amazing friend .. ahh i promise not to cry anymore. maybe lol. and jessica? thankyou. even though you might not think u did much. thanks for just not being mad at me. and reassuring me when you knew i was worried. 

p.p.s. i <3 my nicki. i'm her overseas angel. and itll stay that way. i'm sorry i didnt write it in my livejournal yesterday nikz .. but ill write it today cuz u know i didnt forget. HAPPY BIRTHDAY NICKI. i hope everything went great for you babe. u deserve nothing less than the best"

"event","i was talkin with Rocelle last night, and she asked me to do a favour for her. She wants me to write to jonpaul in prison and ""keep him company"" by writing letters; cuz she don't want him to get lonely or whatever. At first i was wondering why she was asking *me* to write, and why she wasn't doing it herself. i mean come on they've been a couple for 2 and a half years..and about to have a baby in like august. You'd think she'd be the one writing. 

    But then she told me she was going to break up with him. She found out that before he got locked up he was tryin to hook up with another girl. I mean thats so totally screwed right there, dont get me wrong. i love jonpaul and all .. i mean he's like a big brother to me. But how could he do that? celle was pregnant with his baby, and he still tried to get with other chicks? riiite. thats messed up. She still cares a LOT about him though, i know she does .. she told me. She doesn't want him to get lonely, but it cant be her to be the one to keep him company no more. I thought it would be more stressfull for her to not have him there while she's pregnant...but she actually said its a lot better. go figure. but i understand what she's saying. i mean there's no more fights, no more wondering where he is all the time. So maybe, this whole situation is better the way it happened. Cuz now, celle can experience other things out there, different from her 2 and a half years with jp. She's strong, even stronger when she's not with him. She'll get through all of this. I just wish i was up in frisco again so i could help more. 

     So now i'm stuck with this letter. Not that i don't wanna do it. i do. But its juss weird and all .. i'll be busting out writing out of the blue. JP might be like wtf? And i also don't know where to start. What .. do i juss say ""hi jonpaul .. how you doing in prison? good i hope?"" that right there is hella gay. whatever .. i'll write the letter. I hope it come out alright tho, i don't wanna make things worse for jp.... ahhh stressfull much?!"

"event","SoOoO .. yay. My first livejournal entry, and i'm happpyyyy. [Thanks erin! *mWaHzZ* lmao too many choices too many questions ahhh] I'm STILL trying to figure out how to work this damn thing. LoL i'm very slow at this shizzle. i'll make it look better later on. 

     annneeewaiiiise .. so today was an alritey day. i woke up at like 9:30 .. watched an old episode from MTB2 that was on T4. It was the ""Jacob's troubled soul"" phase. Oh wait, there were a lot of those. LoL nahh JacOb's awesome. umm whatever it was the LSBAC recording one. Antony and Lee from BLUE were on T4 too. God Lee is gay. God Antony is a cutie. haha. Tomorrow, Simon and Duncan are on .. yayy Simon. Eww Duncan. He's sooo like Ashley; its kinda scary.             

     So, i got ready, watched some model behaviour reruns, then finally around 12, got picked up. i went out with rachel, sarah [her sister], sam [her sister's friend], and lizzie [ rach's aunt]. It was cool, we went to Kingston and bought some stuff for Rachel's brother's b-day party on Friday. I bought him a ""Bob The Builder"" colouring book and some Winnie the Pooh furry stickers as a present. WOW im nice lol .. shh but i almost stole the stickers for myself. I mean who DOESNT love furry stickers? and i mean pooh bear ones? those ROCK. lol whatever. after that we went and ate at T.G.I.F's and it was coo. we had like a waiter that had a Rupaul-ish voice. Me and Rach spent half the lunch tryin to figure out if it was a guy or a girl haha .. mad dorkiness. 

    We watched Ocean's 11. My 2nd time. i LOVE that film. It's like sooo smooth and shizzle. and i mean Brad Pitt is DaYuMn fine in that movie. But he's always eating in every scene. go figure. lol that movie amuses me tho. so yay. 

     After that i came home, and Amy called me, she wanted for me, her, Lauren, and Sarah to meet up this Friday and juss chill or whatever, cuz Sarah's goin to Tener Reef on Sunday. [Sunday yayyy Helen gets back from Austria!] But i cant go on Friday..cuz DUH its Good Friday. Which means .. on Friday, no phone, no txting, no aol, no tv, no computer, no music at alllll, no nothing except for reading and going to church. So obviously i couldnt go. But mee and amy are gonna meet up and go to Oxford Street to go find where our work offices for work experience is gonna be at. YAY CD:UK. YAY O-Town will be here in JULY hopefully! ... 

     Arnolda called me up too, we're gonna meet up with the rest of the old confirmation crew. YAY i can ask Antony to holla at his friend for me. cuz that boy was pretty cute... ahh we'll see how it goes with the *nameless guy* ..."

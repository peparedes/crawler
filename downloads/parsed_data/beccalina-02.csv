"event","What a skeletal wreck of man this is

Translucent flesh and feeble bones
The kind of temple where the whores and villians
Try to tempt the holistic tomes

Running rapid with free thought to free form
In the free and clear
Where the matters at hand are shelled out like lint at a laundromat
To sift and focus on the bigger, better, now

We all have a little sin than needs venting
Virtues for the rending
And laws and systems
And stems ariff from the branches of office
Do you know what your post entails?

Do you serve a purpose?
Or purposely serve?

Lying down inside of your adavistic galore
The value of a Summer spent
And a Winter earned

For the rest of us there is always Sunday.
The day of the week that reeks of rest
But all we do is catch out breaths
So we can wade naked into the bloody pool
And place our hand on the big black book.

To watch the knives zig-zag between our aching fingers.

A vacation is a count-down
T-minus your life and counting
Time to drag your tongue across the sugar-cube
And hope you get a taste

What the FUCK is all this for?! (What the hell is goin' on?!)
SHUT UP!!

I could go on and on, but, lets move on shall we?

Say, you're me and I'm you
And they all watch the things we do
And like a smack of spite
They threw me down the stairs
Haven't felt like this in years
The great magnet of malicious magnanamous refuse
Let me go and
Punch me into the dead spot again.

Thats where you go when theres' no one else around
It's just you
And there was never anyone to begin with now was there?

Sanctomonious pretentious dasterdly bastards
With their thumb on the pulse
And a finger on the trigger

CLASSIFIED MY ASS! that's a FUCKING secret and you know it!

Government is another way to say
Better
Than
You.

It's like ice but no pick
A murder charge that won't stick
It's like a whole other world
Where you can smell the food
But you can't touch the silverware

Hah, what luck
Fascism you can vote for
Isn't that sweet

And we're all gonna die some day
Because thats the American way
And I've drunk too much
And said too little
When your gaffer taped in the middle
Say a prayer, save face
Get yourself together and (see whats happening)
SHUT UP! (FUCK YOU!)
FUCK YOU!

I'm sorry, I could go on and on but
It's time to move on, so

Remember your a wreck, an accident
Forget the freak, your just nature

Keep the gun oiled and the temple clean
Shit, snort and blaspheme
Let the heads cool and the engine run

Because in the end,
Everything we do
Is just everything we've done. 


Stone Sour~ Omega

Good fuckin stuff there. I'm off to Canada, o how I love your beer!"

"event","So yeah, I've been trying to find a job. I've filled out 2 applications today, called this guy for a nanny job, hopefully he'll call me back. I'd love to just work with kids all summer long. Who knows...I am trying though. I will do more tomorrow and I plan on going into Kindercare and yelling at them b/c I've called twice and haven't even gotten a good answer on a follow up status. Assholes. I'm bored during the day. It's only my second day too. I do know where I'm going to live next year. Well at least if our credit checks out right, which I don't see why it wouldn't. It's cheaper than here too and it's bigger. So I'm definately excited. I made Risha go and fill out the stuff well actually turn it all in even though she was sick from ummm stuff. Yeah really interesting having her throw up in a bucket in my car as I drive. HEHE I felt bad b/c I was laughing but then again she was too b/c she knew she shouldn't have been. We were suppose to go and check it out together like super early this morning but she didn't get up to early not that having ppl still over at 4 really helped matters. I didn't really know anyone it was all people from Risha's work and she got wasted with them. Muy interasante. So I totally forgot what I was typing damn it. It's all because I'm talking to Krystle on the phone...
::short intermission::

Okay so now what was I saying? I dunno I'll just leave that a wild tangant there and go on with whatever comes to mind. Which isn't much b/c my life is dull and boring and I feel bad for who ever reads all the way down to the bottom of this. Poor, poor ppl."

"event","My keys are still missing, ::sniffles:: so I stayed at my parents house last night since I wasn't sure if Risha was going to be home or not and I wanted to watch a movie with Dan. Good movie by the way is Amelie (sp???) lil cracked out but good. I like the name too, I think it's pretty...so maybe my poor daughter will not be named Heaven Leigh after all. LOL yes I would do that to my daughter. I'm at the Rochester library b/c Risha left for an appointment and I left, forgot to un lock the door and am regretfully locked out until she gets back. I'm so pathetic. I'll get my new keys tomorrow. Need to go full job hunting but I don't like it...grr again. Eww the guy next to me has hairy feet. Don't ask I just looked down and he's wearing sandles and their hairy. YUCK! Need to go check out an apartment with Risha, it's cheap and near school which is good. I'm just worried about the bedroom sizes. I hung out with Krystle this morning YEA! It was good fun. I was playing with her cousins cats, they are so cute. The kitten is highly amusing. I have to go and visit her this week since she's house sitting. I can't wait. I can't think of anything else other than I'm jobless, keyless, and poor. Damn what a shitty way to be. Hopefully it will all be over soon. I have a few numbers to call for jobs that I found in the paper. We'll see. Well I guess that's it. Bye!"

"event","So my apartment keys are missing. It really sucks b/c for all I know I could have lost them in a parking lot. I know I had them Friday, and noticed that they were gone today...yeah not cool at all. I thought I saw them up at the warehouse when my mom and I dropped off something to my dad, but I guess not. I'm so screwed. So I'm spending the night in Roseville so I can really get down and look for them tomorrow or at least know I can get in to my apartment by asking the office for help. Hell I don't have a job anymore so I don't have no where to be tomorrow. No I didn't officially lose my job it's just done for the summer. And yes I have applied places but they haven't answered and it's pissing me off. I'll give them a ring tomorrow and see what the hell is going on and also apply to other places. I hate applying to places. It sucks really badly b/c they ask for the same damn information. I have a resume made but for my kind of jobs it doesn't matter b/c they still want the damn app. filled out. Why can't I give the resume, and if I get the job fill out the app for paper work. Grrr.. So yes my daycare job is over and I already miss it. I want to find a good job that pays extremely well and I don't have to do anything at all. That would be awesome. lol. I heard of one from Adam today whom I saw at Micaela and Gina's open house. He collects money from laundrymates. You get reembursed for your gas and other stuff and it pays extremely well. I could do that, might be extremely pissy b/c of traffic but I'd do it. 

Went to Cedar Pointe on Wednesday. It was awesome. It was just Risha and I. Rained a lil bit but the longest wait was for Millenium b/c of the rain and it shut the ride down. But it was cool. Had a good time and the such. Got to see my friend Rob, who works there and got us in for free. ::THANK YOU HUNNIE!:: That was interesting, and we'll leave it at that. It was a tough day b/c I went to Roseville for the game Tuesday b/c I knew the Pistons would win and really wanted to walk Gratiot. I was dead tired but I did it. Then with still lil sleep went to work Thursday. Yeah I came home after work and slept for 13 hours. It was nice but I was still tired on Friday. Grrr. Came home on Friday to eat dinner with my mommy, and then Rachel drove down b/c she loves me and watched Bring it on with me. She also helped me take Bubba and Romeo for a walk which was nice of her. I took them for a walk Saturday too. They need to get out more. As do all my dogs but there's to damn many. I also went to Trixies with Krystle and Aaron and while they played chess I drew. It was funny b/c while I was searching for the scetch pad I found a tank top and switched it while outside. I turned my back towards the door b/c some guys were smoking outside. One was like that was quick and I'm like yup! I tried to draw a fairy reading and while doing so some guy looked over my shoulder and critized it. I didn't care a whole lot but just a lil bit after he wouldn't shut up and I explained that I haven't had an art class since 8th grade. So it was pretty good for me. I also hung out with Dan early, early morning, did a Coney run and then just talked until 5 in the morning. It was good fun. But yeah, this is way to long and I'm tired so I'm off to bed."

"event","Women are like apples on trees. The best ones are at the top of the tree. 
Most men don't want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of 
falling and getting hurt. Instead, they just get the rotten apples from the ground that aren't as good, but easy....... So the apples at the top think something is wrong with them, when in reality, they're amazing. They just have to wait for the right man to come along, the one who's brave enough to climb all the way to the top of the tree."

Yeah there were more like crayons and would hardly write. But of course my blue and red were almost gone, why? because our kids are the coolest and wanted Go Pistons written all over themselfs. How could that not? We should have taken pictures of them and sent them home with this one lil girl b/c her dad plays for the Pistons (sorry can't say names) and had him bring it to the team. They were all so cute. Believe me it was hard to write GO PISTONS on a tiny lil face. One of our Ben's that go to the school is extremely quiet (he's only 2) I wanted to write I am BIG BEN on his face but his mom said no b/c she wasn't sure if she'd be able to get it off of him. O well. It would have been cute. Been working and the such and that's about it for my time. I got the see Harry Potter 3 which was good but didn't follow the first 2 in how it was made but also didn't follow the book, which sucked but o well I guess. Maybe I should go out and do the filming for the 4th? Now where is Oliver Wood's dressing room???? Hehehe. Well I'm dead tired so I'm gonna go home and sleep before I shop. Buh bye!"

"event","So yesterday was my birthday! It was a great day/night. Some of my close friends were there with me to celebrate in Canada which made me happy. Thank you to Krystle, Aaron, Ryan, Pete, Rachel, Marisha, Don and my brother for coming with me I had a blast. The night started out fun. Krystle and Aaron stopped by b/c I had to see Kris in a skirt (I didn't believe it) then she went home and changed for the night. Ryan also came early and stuff. I had Todd my dad's friend playing his bag pipes from like 7 until we left at 10 it was hilarious. Of course I went to Canada and partyed although I didn't get drunk, but I was so exhausted that I just wanted to chill and dance and be with my friends. Everyone else did though hehe! All I have to say is love you all!

My week was a usual week. I worked and came home. Wednesday I hung out with Rachel and yeah that's about it. lol Wait I lied. I hung out with Marisha on Thursday. We went bowling and cheered on the Pistons! Which I have to say GO PISTONS! b/c we're freaking awesome! Ooooo game 1 tonight I have to find someplace to watch it b/c it won't come in very good at the apartment. It was funny though b/c at the bowling ally Risha and I were the loudest and the rest of the ppl there were guys (like only about 6 of em but still) We were all cheering and stuff. It's gonna be a good game tonight! I'm suppose to go back to the apartment soon and go shopping with Krystle and Aaron at the Village. I want/need/will go see Harry Potter tonight even if I have to go all by myself. And that's a freaking promise. Well I'm gonna go load up my gear and pout about it not being as warm out as I'd like to b/c I want to go swimming at my apartment. Even though I have to share it with lots of other people it's the first time I can say I have a pool so I'm excited and I haven't even been able to go in yet. SNIFFLES! O well I'm gonna go bye ppl!"

"event","Okay now for a weekly review.... it's extremely boring so beware...

Yeah it's a boring week. Monday I worked then went home and umm yeah sat around. No wait I did go shop just a lil bit. I bought myself some new cute underwear! Woo hoo for cute undies  But yeah there was no one to hang out with so I just did that and I think went to bed, no wait I met my Mom at Oakland Mall and drove to Novi with her to pick up Romeo. Tuesday I was suppose to show Rachel the townhouse but stuff ended up happenin and she couldn't come. So I went home after work and took a nap for 3 hours and was late for my other job. It was my Nanny job and I just felt like eww but I ended up just meeting at the park and watching Jason play his baseball game. Risha made me dinner, it was cute. She's more artistic with food than I am. I cook and say eat. She sets it all up on a plate and stuff. But she had shrimp and some lil bread things it was yummy and she had the candles lit and Frank in the background. Now if only I could find a guy to do it for me.... Wednesday I was beyond bored again. I got off work at 12:30 and sat around wishing Risha would come home. Decided to get all dressed up and go window shop down at the Village. Risha finally shows up and says she wants to go with me but can't because she's going to dinner with Jim and his family. Krystle was at Imlay but b/c we have mixed communications I didn't go up and visit. It all turned out okay because Rachel ended up coming to pick up her stuff from my party and we hung out. It was suppose to be a quick time but it wasn't hehe. We went shopping (again) to try to find something for my cousins confirmation. Lets just say I'm horrible to shop with and extremely picky in my clothes. She ended up buying more than I did. I was distracted in Aero talking to my friend and she picked out clothes for me and basically pushed me into a fitting room. I ended up buying a shirt. Then we got Cinibun and I convinced her to go see a movie. It turned out to be a very good night. Saw Mean Girls. Very interesting. I could kind of relate it to Roseville. Especially the sexually active band memebers. Yeah that would be our band. One could always hear some interesting stuff from them. OOO I got the stuff in from my party. Hehe I got more cute lacy undies. I also ordered a garder thingy. It's the cute lil strappy thing that can hold up your silk stockings. So someday my non existant boy might get a cute outfit involving that and heels and such.... hehehe. Today I worked and hung out with Lacey, Krystle and Jeremy. Went shopping/searching for something for my cousins confirmation. I bought some cute shoes instead. They're white and strappy. I'm so excited. Umm that's life in a nut shell. 

I've come to realize that living in Rochester sucks. No one really wants to drive out to visit even if it's only 30 mins away. Not like there's really much to do once you get there. All my friends from school are gone so I'm extremely bored. And if their not gone they have boyfriends, except Rachel. Even Tee Jay has someone (not like that's totally unexpected but he said he wasn't going to find anyone and he's actually got 2)  hmmm.... what a sad reality I live it. 

I'm outtie... Woo hoo for seeing my family this weekend! Be back Monday!!!"

"event","Lets see, Thursday I hung out with Marisha again at her boyfriends apartment and watched the Pistons game. It was good fun. Risha got wasted it was hilarious. She was all like I love you and stuff. She drove us there and I drove myself back b/c she ended up crashing there. I was laughing my ass off. I think this one guy Mikey that is Jim's friend and Risha's been talking about how good a dancer he is and such. Well I think I know him from dancing at for DCP and such as the extremely good dancer that ummm licked my belly once (kind of weirded me out) like last year. But I'm not sure. He says his older brother is a breaker so maybe it is. I can't remember the name of the guy so maybe it is the same. I'll have to find out. Kind of got hit on b/c I was the only single girl there. It was good fun. This one guy had his hair cut in a mullet. It was sad he had the nice long shaggy hair and now it's a mullet. Eww. He walked me to my (actually Risha's) car twice b/c I left her keys in the apartment. It was a good night. 

Friday I worked. It was my last full Friday because they cut my hours down. It sucks. I dunno what they'll do b/c I do most of the cleaning on Friday afternoons. Also, I've filled in for people in the other classrooms. Aftercare is gonna be stressful b/c people don't show up and no one is informed until 4:30. It's stressful and I'm feelin for the people that are not left with it. I came home and cashed my check (yeah I'm still poor) I also left the check Rachel gave me at the apartment like a dumbass. SO mad. I didn't realize until I was in line at the bank. Went to Cracker Barrel with my mommy and got my usual dumplings. We've had the server before and my mom thinks he's got a crush on me but the last time we had him he asked what we wanted to drink I said coke and he asked if I wanted Diet. So of course I made it seem like he thought I was fat and I basically got everything I asked for quickly. It was hilarious. I also went shopping at Meijer with my mom. I got cool argile underwear (which I let everyone know on my away messages) they don't exactly fit my bottom b/c their not made for big butt people. I got new sandles that are extremely comfortable. And some new pj's this is a pink man beater with a playmate name tag thingy on it and cool boxers that have pink stars on it. I'm excited. lol I went to Canada with Brooke and Jack. My stomache was so full I could barely drink anything. We left early and such. I did see Dustin Evans and Jeff Phillps which was interesting b/c I haven't seen them since High School. 

Saturday I sat around the house all day. Well sort of I cleaned my car inside and out and added rain-x to it. The I got ready and went to babysit. She's the most adorable girl. Only 8 months old. Went over to Alli's/Lacey's house. Hung out with Lacey b/c Alli didn't want to. Decided to hang out with Vinnie but had to go get ready and so we went back to my house and SUPRISE it's basically flooded. It sucked. I ran upstairs to get my mom and told her and Lacey and I spent at least an hour cleaning the basement. It sucked. But we still got ready and hung out with Vinnie. It was a good time. I think he liked her, I had a slight jealous moment but I know it's not her fault. He also has a girlfriend still but I guess their not doing to good. Got home about 4 and slept. 

Sunday I went to the movies with my mom and brother to see Shrek 2. It's an extremly good movie. It's been a while since my mom has gone to a theatre to see and movie so I had to take her. Unfortunately we went to Star Gratiot. I hate it there. The workers are so slow and such. It was a bad exprience at first. Like we went for the 3:15 show and the only place where 3 ppl could sit was right up front so we got our ticket switched for the next show and waited 45 min for it to start. Then we went out to eat at The Alamo. Can't say I like Mexican to much but it's a good place. I went there with Brian when he was home last time and I was all like awww. I also switched the shoes my mom got for me at Dunhams before the movie. So now I have 2 new tennis shoes. They were on sale for $10 so I'm excited about them. I swear I'm spoiled but not rotten. lol. It was weird b/c I usually wear a 7-7 1/2 but the new shoes are 6 1/2. So weird. But that was my weekend. 

I'm watching Good Will Hunting. I've never seen it before. It's a really cute movie. I'm jealous I want a good guy. I need to stop being picky. But I think I'm worth the wait for any reasons...LOL I just re read my last Paragraph and it's all like quick sentances like I'm five. >See Becky. See Becky watch movie. Becky likes the movie. YEA! lol. 

I hopefully everyone likes my new design. It was all made possible b/c of Nell. She made it all for me. I'm so excited b/c now it's not boring. So checki it out and I have to say LOVE YA NELL! 

I think that's all I can think of. Hmmmmm....yeah so that's it. bye for the week!"

"event","Hey, it's been a pretty long time since I've written but I've been extremely busy with my usually boring life. Actually it hasn't been that bad. Working at the daycare is getting better. It's a very rewarding job for me. I get jealous sometimes when Risha tells me she made $240 in a weekend and it's like fuck, I make that in 2 weeks. But looking it in the macro-economic way (which I passed yah!) I love my job and although it doesn't give much physical capital ($$) it gives me human capital (my own knowledge) I will naturally feel more comfortable in a classroom b/c of this job. Also you can't put a price on the cute moments like having a 2 yr old tell you that the Scooby Doo movie ""got screwed up"" or when they are all cute and cuddlely and just want to be held especially the difficult ones that don't go to just anybody. I guess I'm preparing myself perfectly to be a teacher b/c they don't make any money either. So it all works out fairly well. On that note of kids I have to add that I was peed on. I think it's funny and it just landed on my foot, nothing to bad and it's not like I haven't been peed on by a dog so yeah. He was a lil boy and didn't mean to but I find it funny and take in with a good sense of humor. 

Went and saw the  movie Troy with Jason on friday. It was funny b/c this guy from my history class was there and we said hey I explained I was waiting for my friend and was suppose to be meeting with his friends and it turned out that it was all in the same group. It was a good time. It's also a really good movie with great action scenes. There was a scene where Brad Pitt's character sleeps with a virgin and in the morning he's watching her and some ppl were laughing, I thought it was cute and sweet and wouldn't mind if that happened to me, as long as I didn't look stupid. hehe

Saturday was Rachel's birthday party and as I think of this my dumb ass didn't call Elena and wish her a Happy Birthday on Saturday. OMG if you read this I""m sooooo sorry. But for Rachel's birthday it was awesomely fun. I got drunk, YES read it again Becky actually got drunk. It was a fun night. Smironoff Vodka Raspberry and Smironoff drinks mixed are just the best thing I've ever had. Really proud of that drink. I think I might try it with my apple vodka sometime. But lets put it this way since it was a bon fire someone had to keep me out. hahaha! I only did 2 drunk phone calls one which I feel extremely stupid for. O well that's what there for. I talked to my mom at 2 in the morning with out realizing at first that it was her, but she was laughing at me. hehe. Sunday, recovered, got peed on Monday and chilled with Marisha and her friends at another bon fire but I was DD. Risha wondered into a tree b/c the bathroom was behind a tree it was funny. She almost fell off a cooler. It was a good night but I was damn tired today. Went and looked at the 3 bedroom at Auburn Village with Risha and she liked it. Didn't like the scary mexicans standing on the corner though when I was driving her around the complex. Visited another one which would be perfect too, but we don't make enough b/c even though its cheap, you need to make 3 x's rent a month and it's only for one person which totally sucks. It was only 820 and free water, heat, and electric, and you couldn't use a co signer. grrr.... O well it will all work out for a reason. I feel fine at Auburn Village, I guess there was a gun shot like a year ago but Risha grew up in Licoln Park and me in da ville, although no terribly horrible places they aren't like our Rochester so its like goin back home for me. So hopefully this doesn't stop her from living there. We'll see but so far she's saying yes. I need to show Rachel and see if she wants a 3 bedroom or the basement of the 2 bedroom. Thats all that matters now. Marisha wants her to live in the basement of the 2 bedroom b/c it would be cheaper. I'm asking for it to be up to Rachel.

O yeah, went and listened to Krystle's boyfriends band last Wednesday. Their really good. The drummer wants to make out with me (go figure) Kind of funny story to it. Aaron was rubbing Kris's shoulders in the car (him and his friend were in the back) so his friend started rubbing mine (I'm not complaining) and then he played with my hair and krystle and I were like just as long as he doesn't ask if I want to fool around (like the last guy from Mikey's party) well I guess he told Aaron that anytime I wanted to get drunk and make out was fine with him. Found out he said it after my story so it doesn't count as much but I guess he still wants to, I dunno, I just think it's funny. 

Well that's in for now although I'll probably think of more afterwards o well"

"event","Last night was my lingeri and sex toy party, woo hoo! It was fun and stuff. It seems weird, the good one has a sex toy party. O well it's good times were girls can get together and chit chat. It was suppose to start at 6 but yeah most weren't there until 7:30ish. I got a little nervous but it turned out all okay. We all had good fun. Krystle is so FIRED as my best friend b/c she calls me at 6 to tell me she was just leaveing her house. Note the time that my party started. But she got me a cute ring so I guess she's slightly forgiven. hehe.

Went to Mikey Ryans afterwards to his lil get together. It was good fun. I wanted to hog tie and throw this one girl into the closet b/c she was stupidly drunk. They said that she was upstairs making out with someone in the closet. I said I wanted a bucket of ice water to dump on her. It would be hilarious. Yeah and during this night my main point was made. I was talking to Travis and his new room mate who I think his name is Aaron. Well we were getting bored so they invited me to go watch Army of Darkness at their apartment and the other end of the building. Well Travis goes to sleep part way through and Aarons cat was playing with my hair. He pulls the what shampoo do you use it smells good blah blah blah. I tell him and then he starts kind of playing with my hair. He askes me and this is straight forward, Do you want to fool around? I was cracking up after he asked me. I was like you have to be a lot smoother than that. In my mind I was thinking wow, yup my point is proved....

Happy Mother's Day to all the Mommies!
Gots to get home now, bye...."

"event","Okay, so hears the full story.

I hung out with Dave after not really seeing him in a while. I considered him as the guy that got away last summer. He was completely sweet and such but he lived in North Branch at the time and was working down in the area. (I know this probably isn't a good start to the reason for my ranting)Well we ended up losing touch and he moved down to the area and had a girlfriend for the past 9 months. She also made him delete the girls number in his phone and blah blah blah. I've tried to keep touch, said Hi when I would see him in the club. When I first saw her, one of his friends told me how they all disliked her b/c she was ditzy and bitchy and stuff. Well like I've said I've kept in touch. When I would see him at work I still had feelings for him except for the last time b/c his hair was super long and its jsut not him. Well anyways every now and then he'd beep beep me if they needed 4th for Euchar usually late at night. On Tuesday I was bored so I beep beeped him and he said he was playing Halo and I said I loved that game and he's like we need a 4th so I came over and played with them. It was good fun, I can be comfortable around him and act goofy b/c he's goofy and the such. I like his friends their so nice to me. (He says it's b/c I'm not his girlfriend or some odd thing but that will be later) I invited him and Carl to go to Canada with me for Cinco de Mayo even though they are 21 but I was like I can drink with you. It was cheaper for them to go to JD's so he canceled on me (which I didn't end up going b/c Brooke was sick) Well I called b/c I was upset about not going so he invited me to JD's with them (I had to DD b/c they all wanted to drink.) I've never been to JD's but it's awesome. I've classified it as a coffee house with good cheap beer. (Nothing better than that HEHE)I had a really really good time. Even though I was the only sober one, which everyone kept saying was weird but cool that I could be sober and have such a good time. Dave and I were connecting for lack of a better word. When we got back his ex two wayed him and started arguing b/c she doesn't want to give him up but he isn't happy anymore. I was still over and he's like I'm going to bed, Becky come talk with me. (Seriously nothing happened, we just talked nor did I think anything was going to, well I wanted a kiss good night but that's about it) After he went down Chris and Carl were singing the old school song of me and him in a tree so I think they've obviously said something the night before. I went down to his room and we talked. They had a lot of history in that short nine months is all I have to say about their personal stuff. I told him my theory of how he was the right guy wrong time and such. Among the stuff he said was our on going joke of how I should be a stripper (for Krystle it's her boobs being in the way for me everyone wants my body in the way hmmm) and how he's feeling shallow but he wanted me naked and he's like I feel horrible but I just want to sleep with you and remember he was intoxicated so a lot of extra stuff was coming out. I explained that it wasn't the first time it's happened to me. Hell there was Vinnie when he was drunk just saying he wanted to Fuck me, especially since we've met so yeah I'm used to it. Well we heard Emily and Kara show up and then Kara came down and said that his ex was there and she heard me. Well yeah that ruined the night. But I can't see why he's so in love with her and all that such but wants certain things in which I can give. It's very frustrating. Same thing happend with another guy where his girlfriend was a dolt and basically described me in what he wanted and yeah he's with someone else now. So that's just a basic frustration...

And then I read Brian's stuff. I can't help but a slight twing of jealousy I'm feeling. He's like totally twitterpatted with this girl in his apartment complex and I'm happy but I'm jealous of the way he speaks of her. It's poetic and such and just something I've been wishing for. We have a completely strange relationship. He did insist that we would definately date when he came home from service (about 2 or more years) so for now we're friends and I love hearing what's going on in his life and help him out when he is with someone new. But there's just been a change. I know he's busy and everything but it was certain things he's said to me on the phone where I know theres a lot of disapointment in me. Old times were brought up when I got sick during a date and felt like I would die and left early, and then since I had a hotel when I visited him. Its hard to hear that and associate it with my ""innocence"" stuff. I can't help my own feelings of discomfort and I'm usually not a jealous person but it just comes in at weird times. It's just things play in my mind way to much and there is my own disapointment in myself for different things. So that added to my own rage I suppose.

It also doesn't help that a lot of my good friends are currently not single. Krystle isn't she's finally dating Aaron (yah!) Risha's with Jim, Brooke's with Corey. Rachel Dempsey is the only one I know that is single that I would hang out with on a regular basis. So it's just a huge wondering of what is wrong with me. And it all came out in my raving. I think that sums much of it up, there is of course plenty of extra stuff in there that is missing but this is already long enough and whoever actually reads all this, is either really bored or really loves me. Either way things go it's a semi explaination and will have to do for now. 


Happy stuff. Camp Shamrock for this summer I have a possibility of moving up a position which is awesome. I was suprised by the honorable mention since I've only been there for 2 years and have had some interesting stuff happen at camp. Hehe...we'll not mention any more...

So yeah that's about it for now. PS!! IF anyone can help me make my site more interesting in color and such I'm going to play dumb girl for a change and see if someone will help me out of lazyness and total blondness of not understanding and make it pretty."

"event","I've decided that I hate the whole male species. I can't take their bull shit anymore. Every guy I meet just wants sex, it's like it would be some kind of trophy to them, another one to add to their long list. They don't want to date me because of my ""innocence"" bull fucking shit. Their just pissed because I won't let them use me and throw me aside. I'm tired of hearing about their ex's and what bitches they were/are. How they just want a nice girl that they can relax with won't use them for their money, keeps their happiness in mind also. Well hey look over here, that would be me. But no, they can't get into my pants the first night so all the rest of the qualifications go for shit. I'm not sorry I take pride in my body and refuse to follow status quo and sleep with every guy I meet. I don't believe in doing that. I don't care if someone else does it but I absolutely rufuse to be like everyone else. If I followed the crowd I wouldn't be fair to myself. But unfortunately that's what guys want, some bitchy girl to spend their money on who obviously doesn't give a care about your happiness except to please their second mind. Fucking morons. Using such a stupid line as you just have way to much innocence. Yeah so I am a virgin big deal, I'm a virgin not a fucking saint. I'm not wearing a fucking chastidy belt, all I would like to find is a guy who isn't going to leave me in a few weeks. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Seriously why? I've heard many versions of the male mind from Tee Jay, your not looking in the right places blah blah blah, your going for the same types of guys, blah blah blah, but I hear how well they treated their ex girlfriends, yes I actually stop and listen to people in this world instead of thinking it is centered around me. I've actually found most guys talk more on the phone with me than I do with them. (hmm what a concept) So if I found out they treated their ex girlfriends with such respect, why the fuck can't they do the same with me. Sometimes I think I should just go and get extremely drunk and say the fuck with innocence...."

"event","So it's been a real long time since I've written in either journal. It's really sad but I've been busy and I did have a long begining last week but I had to go get the pizza and downsized the screen and then when I came back it was gone. So now I must re write it all down again. I'll try to make sense with everything because a lot has happened but then again it hasn't. So we'll start with...

School. Yeah it was really boring and now it is done. I'm so excited b/c now all I'll be doing is working, yeah. I did really well in my classes b/c I got my grades back today. I 4.0 ed in my Group Dynamics class but that's because it's group dynamics and is a communcations class and is extremely easy. I got a 3.0 in my Intro to Russia class and a 3.1 in European History class. I'm suprised with my History class b/c I had to totally fail my final I completely had a brain wash right as I read my essay question. It was horrible. And my econ class was a 2.6 which brought my GPA down, yea for me. Next subject...

Work. It's going okay. I have more hours for the spring semester and I need to find a new job for the summer. Nannying is okay. Getting more used to it. So yeah that's work for ya.

Boys. Completely stupid. Still single, currently not dating. I did have a guy that was going pretty good. We talked on the phone for about 3 weeks and then I went to visit him because he said he'd take me out to dinner. Should have had him come to my house but I went to his. He was nice and I had a good time. It was a down to earth type of thing. We did however hang out with his room mate the whole time. I like to get to know someone and it's hard to do with a friend there sometimes. When I left he said he liked me a lot and wanted to consider me his and blah blah blah. Yeah all good and nice and then he turned Psycho. I've classified him as manic depressive b/c he was always sad on the phone, bi polar b/c he's flipped out on the phone at me twice ( one time to many, he's lucky he got the second chance to) and he's a compulsive liar. And that was found out in one day. He wanted me to visit him all day I said I'd come after work and then as I'm almost there he called to say that he got into a fight and the cops were called.So I couldn't come of course I called him later and he answered saying that he just got out. Yeah no. And then he said I didn't care and all this stuff b/c I was at state with 3 guys. Then he was suppose to come over on a Thursday and he didn't, I didn't even get a call from him though I called him. I called on Risha's phone and then hung up b/c wow he answered. He called back on her phone and she talked to him. He said family problems I don't believe it. So yup another one bites the dust for me. (which Risha played on his voice mail) 

Life. It's okay. Been going out and hanging out with friends. Sucks b/c I have no one. Risha's got someone and Krystle now has someone (yeah for her) but I""m all alone and it sucks I can never find someone good for me. I pick the wrong ones. I've had a huge long talk with Tee Jay about it but I""m still single b/c I'm picky about who I date but always picky about the wrong ones. O well. Sad life for me. I've been going to Tiki Bob's lately but I don't stay long. Clubs aren't as exciting anymore I get bored easily now. Tomorrow is Tee Jay's b-day woo hoo. So yeah that's what has been going on in a nutshell. It's the same old same old. Maybe something interesting with happen with me and my life will gain a little bit more sunshine. Bye everyone!"

"event","Last week of school, last week of school! I'm so happy. Except I'll be working way more especially on Friday's where I'll be working 10 hour days at the day care. OMG I'm gonna die. I need to find a job for the summer to. O goodness. 

Okay so I'm thinking that this guy I'm talking to is either a little psycho or just drunk a lot when I talk to him. He's very insecure though. Mom says to stay away b/c I don't need that but it's me and I always go for the weirdos. When am I gonna find the guy that deserves me. Tee Jay and I had this huge long talk about it as we walked around State b/c Batman was to drunk to remember how to get back to his dorm. But it was a sad talk on my part and I can't even begin to explain it. Some day I might be able to but not today b/c I don't have that long to be online. So that's my life in a nut shell. I'll write more next chance I get."

"event","Okay, so I had a boring weekend and a boring day. I did get a new bed set. It's pretty blue with big white swirlies on it. Okay so it doesn't sound all that great but it really is. I won't get it until my birthday though. Which is okay because I want to get rid of monster bed ( my 2 twins pushed together ) and get a normal queen. So that means I get to save, save, save. It should be easy once I get more hours in once school is finished. Yeah speaking of school it sucks. I was suppose to meet Brooke in the library to study for a test on Wednesday. But she has strep and is home sick. Okay not a big deal and hope she gets better. Wrong. She has the notes for basically 2 days of class ( we only meet once a week ) and the info that I jotted down on what would be on the test. I gave it to her b/c I was like no biggie I'll see you on Monday. So now I'm screwed. I can't get ahold of her to go get the notes. Once again, I have a test to freak out about. It's not as bad as my econ test. Which is the reason why I don't have notes for last weeks class, I was studying like mad crazy for that. It's a little more important b/c I found out that Russia/East Europe doesn't count towards my IS classes for my Soc. Major. Shitty. So yeah I'm basically screwed all over again. Damn I can't wait for school to be over. It's getting really stressful at this end of the year crap. Grrr. Even though I've been at the library for about 2 hours I haven't done really anything for IS. I've been looking for a new apartment for Risha and me. It sucks b/c it's hard to find a place with rooms semi equal. I'm tired of hearing how she got screwed and blah blah blah. It sucks. So shit for school, shit for home, shit for a life. Damn..."

I also have a Xanga site, which is cool b/c it's easier to talk to Brian on it but none of my other friends can comment b/c you have to have a xanga thingy to do it. So I've gone with live journal and will use this in order to let my friends know what's up with me. For Brian I'll either give him this site or just copy and paste it depending on my mood. We'll see. But yeah right now I'm figuring it all out. So I'll write more after I've got this thing figured out. Yeah for me!"

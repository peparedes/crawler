I also haven't been focusing on the goals I had set out for myself, such as study Japanese.  I find myself being distracted with other tasks, such as fixing Seiji's computer, or attempting to clean up my room or taking care of paperwork."

"event","Before waking up, I vaguely remember having a bit of an unusual dream... but then again, I think most of them are.  I just remember someone was killed intentionally, and they wanted to be, so that a witch-like ceremony could take place to bring them back to life.   They were buried into a hole that was in my backyard, and then they were covered with some concoction, and then with branches and twigs.  Weird indeed.

Woke up a little late this morning. I think it was because Torochan kept crying in the morning.  Steph ended up being the one that reluctantly woke up to feed the cats.  Although he had food, he still kept crying.  It was about 8:50 that I woke up and then I quickly took a shower to get ready, followed by my routine of applying antiperspirant, brushing teeth, and gel in my hair.  Before I took a shower though, I did step on the scale as I do every morning while waiting for the hot water to arrive to the shower.  I was a bit saddened as it seems that I am now gaining weight.  I was down to 173 but have let myself go and indulge into eating ever since we took a cruise.   I need to change my mindset and get back to eating well and exercising.   I am now up to 183 :(.  Steph starts her ""miracle diet"" today so that should help keep me motivated as well.

Gave Steph a kiss before I rushed out the door.  With the construction going on, it slowed down traffic, but I took a short cut by the Amazon Village Mall.  Got to work around 9:20am.  Now I have to wash out my bowl so that I can eat some cereal here at the office.



11:12 AM - Filling out a goal planning review sheet for work.  Having a hard time thinking of what to put in it.

Lunch time 12:15ish - Went to Chicken Lickin' with the rest of the crew.

Got back to the office. Merged in some changes from v1.6.5 branch to our trunk.  Had some issues with that... of course.

Now working on running these unit tests and fixing bugs to make them pass."

"event","I've decided that I will try to keep a daily journal of everything I do, so that I can look back and reflect on what I spend my time doing and seeing what I can change.

I think I woke up around 10:30 or so this morning, took a shower and was pretty hungry.  I wanted to have some cereal, more specifically I wanted to try out the ""Chocolate Marshmallow Mateys"", which is essentially Coco Puffs with marshmallows.  Unfortunately, we were out of milk, but Steph volunteered to go to the store to pick up some milk and other groceries.  I probably ended up eating around 11.

Afterwards, I went to the back yard to adjust the new wide-angle camera that I switched out from the zoom camera that was in there before.  I like that I can see pretty much all of the back yard now, although, I still feel that the Q-See 48030 camera has a better image.  From now on, I think the rest of the cameras that I upgrade.... if I upgrade, since the wife doesn't like the idea, will be the Q-See 48030.

I feel like I should spend my time being productive, so I wanted to clean up a bit.  I vacuumed and steam cleaned the rug by the TV, it really needed it.  I then started to clean up the spare bedroom and organize it.  I can finally see most of the carpet, and I was able to steam clean it more.  It still smells like cat pee in one corner when Kit ran in there and was scared.  

I like spending time with Kit and the other cats, but I find myself with little patience and getting bored of doing any one activity pretty quickly, and then tend to not spend a lot of time with the cats.

We had left over curry for lunch.  It was good.  We should cook curry more frequently since it tends to last a long time and will save us money.

I snacked on a Fuji apple before having the curry for lunch.

Steph left around 6:30 to go to her APO meeting.  She's no longer an active brother since it's her last semester.

I wanted to study some Java programming but I think I'm putting it off until I get a book that I ordered online.

Spoke to Ghizlane online a bit.  She's a girl from Morocco that found my through Skype since I live in Orlando.  She's flying in in a few days, May 4th I think she said.  She had a bunch of questions about living here, such as lodging and transportation.  I bet an out of state tuition will be expensive for her.

Which reminds me, I decided to go through the mail and noticed that UCF needed documents sent to them proving that I'm a local resident.  Mailed over a copy of my passport, driver's license and vehicle registration.  

When the wife got home from her meeting, she asked if she should pick up food and I asked for Firehouse.  It was closed so she came home empty handed.  We drove to Subway instead.  They were one meat ball short of being able to make a full foot long sub, so they charged me for a 6"" instead.  I added spinach and jalapenos to it.   They also toasted it when I asked them not to, but it wasn't that big of a deal.

Afterwards, we watched Family guy and Simpsons, then I finished cleaning the spare bedroom."

"event","I'm also a lot happier and less stressed out now.

My brother had the ""great"" idea of getting a dog a few months ago.  I reluctantly agreed to it.  

That dog was a big nightmare.  She'd make a mess out of everything.  Slobering everywhere.  Tracking in the dirt from outside.  Digging holes in the yard.   Pooping everywhere.  Peeing on the carpet.  Chewing up the furniture.  Constantly bothering you.  Barking unnecessarily.  Scratching at the doors.  I could not think of a good reason for having that dog, but every day, I was constantly reminded why I didn't like the dog.   I had to put up a barricade between the kitchen and the living room so that the dog could not go into the living room and pee in it, and it was annoying having the dog run to the front door every time someone came over and I had to hold her back so she wouldn't run out.   

I've done nothing but complain about the dog every day.  My brother FINALLY gave the dog up for adoption on Saturday.   I was very happy with his decision, although I feel a bit bad that he had to give up the dog, but it was for the best.  The dog will have a family that will be able to spend time to train her, and be able to give her the attention she needs.  That dog was always left alone since my brother was always too busy, and I was busy myself.

After that experience, I can confidently say that I am not a dog person.  Cats are a lot easier to take care of, and a lot cleaner too."

"event","It's been a LONG time since I've written here.  I'm a little bored at the moment so I thought I'd update this.

Here's a quick recap of what happened over the weekend.

Friday: Took the day off work.  I was just way too tired and out of it to go into work, and I'm glad that I took the day off.  I was able to sleep in and relax during the day.  Felt very very nice.

Saturday:  Steph and I went to the Fringe Festival for the third year.  I saw this show called ""Mental Mania"" starring Mark Stone.  He's a ""mentalist"" who performs ESP performances.  Very impressive performance, not sure how he did some of his tricks, but I was very impressed.  Afterwards, I met up with my dad to help him shop for computer parts so that he can build a new computer.

Sunday: Steph, Steph's parents, and I went to the Fringe Festival again.  This time we went to see a show called ""All Expenses Paid"".  I was anticipating something pretty crappy and boring.  To my delight, the show had a great story line behind it, and the actors were pretty talented in their performance, although their props and scenes could have used some work.   

My desktop computer is acting up again for some reason.   I have no idea what the problem is exactly, but I'm starting to think that it has something to do with the on-board RAID controller.  Every time my computer acts up, my RAID array is messed up and I have to rebuild it.  I'm thinking about a dedicated RAID controller card."

"event","If you, or anybody you know would like to have your XBOX or PS2 modified, I am the man to do it.   

If you want to be able to add a hard drive to your PS2 and save your games onto the hard drive so that you don't have to use the CDs anymore, or want to play ""backup"" versions of your games, you'll need to have it modified.

Also, if you want to be able to do the same with the XBOX and take advantage of MANY kewl features, like running emulators on the XBOX, Media Center, play games from the hard drive, and MUCH more, then you'll need it modified.  

I've done a lot of research on the software and hardware that works the best to modify these consoles, and will be glad to show you my setups too.

I've found this to be a very fun and relaxing hobby.   You need to have a lot of patience to modify these units when  you solder these VERY tiny points and wire the intricate mod-chips on.

Here's what I've decided to charge:
$100 for the chip and installation, which includes installation of the appropriate software, and flashing the ModChip, and that's for either XBOX or PS2.  It's well worth it once you've gone through 2 or more of your game backups, since games can cost on average of $50 each."

"event","I've been to 3 different proms for 3 different schools, with 3 different dates... if you really want to call them dates.   Well... now I've been to my 4th prom, and I can truly say that it was unlike any of the other proms I've ever been to.  The other ones were kind of awkward, and didn't feel quite right, even the one at my own school.

This time, I was with a very special person, Steph of course.   Although I don't really know anyone else at the school other than a few of Steph's friends,  I felt very comfortable there, I think it's just Steph in general, I always feel safe and comfortable around her.  

For the most part, it was a lot of fun.  I felt like a star riding in the limo.  The music could have been better, only a few songs you could actually ""Dance"" to.  Most of the songs were just repetitive heavy bass that people just bob up and down to.

The food was delicious, we had Chicken Marsala and this heavenly chocolate cake for dessert.

Afterwards, we went to Steak and Shake for dinner, big mistake, not a place to sit with everyone else going there, so we weren't able to sit down with the rest of the gang.

We ended up going to Denny's a few miles away, in CHS territory and out of TCHS area.  Nice and quiet, without too many people.  

I had a great time, and am glad that Steph spent her senior prom with me."

The Wrox line of books have multiple authors, which help ensure a good amount of various information.   In 2nd, I'd recommend books by Microsoft Press (only if it's for a Microsoft technology of course).

I just watched ""I, Robot"".  Steph told me that some of her friends said that movie is not good, but I don't know why anybody would say that.   It was a great movie.  The movie takes place in the future, but wasn't set in a cheesy Hollywood future with flying cars.  The movie isn't very predictable, so it keeps you wondering what's going to happen next.  Lots of special effects and action, and the ending is very happy and emotional, it almost makes you want to cry.

I don't know if I can really agree with this statement.  Lately, a lot of things that I now regret doing are starting to get to me.  Most of the things I that I have have lead to some negative financial consequences.  For example, I regret the way that I used my credit cards, I regret the way I drove in the past that has now lead to very high insurance rates, I regret spending my money foolishly, etc etc.

I guess it's been a tough lesson learned, and at the rate I'm going now, I'll put all this behind me and be worry-free in no time.  

Not having someone there to guide me, I've unfortunately have had to learn a lot of lessons the hard way.  I've always been left to do things on my own, which I guess is good now, it has helped me become independent, but I also wish I had someone to always push me in the right direction.  

I'm not sure if I could handle not having someone like Steph around, I have grown very close to her, and can turn to her when I'm feeling worried and stressed out.  She also makes sure that I don't spend my money too foolishly when she's around."

A bigger room would alleviate this problem.... or maybe it would just give me more space to make a mess in, lol.

Anyways...  Christmas just ended.

Here's a recap of how it went.

I drove to my Grandmother's on Christmas Eve, only to have my transmission just about go out on the way there... it started vibrating REALLY bad and didn't shift quite right anymore.  Got a gift card and some checks from my relatives.

Got back home, waited a few hours, my mom and stepdad came over.  I gave them their gifts, and they gave us ours (us is my brother and I).  I got some new shirts along with some money. That same night, I gave my brother his gift, which was a Logitech Driving Force Steering wheel for the PS2, which I later found out also works fot the PC.  He gave me my gift which is a 5 DVD set of Jackie Chan's older movies (I'm a big fan of Jackie Chan).

Christmas day... woke up much earlier than I cared to... I was supposed to be at my Dad's at 8:30 am... but I slept through my alarm, and then found myself waking up to my phone at 8:30 wondering if I'm on my way yet or not, lol.   They did expect us to arrive late because I told them of how my brother and I both go to bed very late (6:00 am usually).    I'm a bit embarassed to tell you what I got from them, but I suppose I will say since it's pretty funny.

I felt the gift inside the wrapping paper... and immediately knew what it was, especially since it's the same things they got us last year.  That's right... another year of getting an electric toothbrush, toothpaste, calendar, and a chocolate bar, but at least this year they gave us $100 Simon Visa gift cards.

Afterwards, I got home and took a nap.  Waited for Steph to get back to her place from her brother's so that I could see her and give her her gift. I drove there with my car that vibrates like an earthquake since it has a bad transmission, and was very glad to see her. Steph gave me my presents, which she really did not have to do.  She gave me a very nice necklace.  I would have been happy even if it was a plastic necklace, as long as it was from her, but she really went overboard and got me a nice silver necklace.  She also got me this nifty rock water fountain.  It's sitting in my bathroom at the moment, I was thinking about putting it in the living room, but now that it's there, it makes a nice addition.  Her grandmother for some unknown reason decided to get me a gift which consisted of a nice picture to put on the empty spot of my wall in my room.   Her family was very nice and allowed me to come over for dinner.  

I've really felt myself growing a lot closer to Steph lately and feel very comfortable with her now.  Not only is she my best friend, but I also love her very much... it's practically starting to feel like we're married now, lol.  Surprisingly we haven't even had any big arguments anymore... I'm having a hard time recalling the last time we did have one.  I find myself thinking about her more and more often, and thinking about how happy I am when I'm with her.  

I know she wants to go to college and have her freedom, my biggest fear is losing her.  I would never be able to find anybody as special and unique as her.  I guess I'll just have to play it by ear for now.  I won't ask her to stay here or keep her from being happy, I am supportive of her decision and want her to be happy while she's at school."

I was supposed to write a long time ago and tell you how homecoming went with Steph and I.   It went well, something that I will not forget, and Steph just gave me the pictures from homecoming today, and fortunately they came out real well.

I still do the websites for the NASCAR Regional Racing series.... well, sort of.   We've moved it over to a new server, and I now have less control of it.  That's not so bad for me, since I now have a valid excuse for not being able to perform certain tasks with our website.  

I am also now working on a project for myinstantreplay.com .  It's been keeping me VERY busy, I've been pulling some all-nighters lately, staying up til 5 am trying to get my work done. Schoolwork is falling behind a bit but I can still manage.   Speaking of which, I just realized that I have a presentation to make Thursday (today) at 5:45, and it could last a few hours, which would interfere with my class, not a big deal since it's a self paced class.  

I got a phone call this afternoon from a company that I submitted my resume to, they asked me a few questions, asking me about my experience, skills, etc etc.   They told me that the starting salary would be around $50~60,000!  That's some nice money if you ask me.  If I qualify for this job and take it on, I could be looking at making close to $100,00/year! But then I'd have like 0 free time for anything else.   I do need the money though, I've got to get out of debt. I guess I'll see how things go.

Time to get back to work."

"event","Today I took off work early, like 12:00 early.  I left simply because I felt like I was wasting my time working inside of a flourescent lit, windowless office with an inferior computer.  While at home, I've tried to ensure that I show that I am being much more productive than I would be at the office, in an attempt to encourage my boss to allow me to work at home.

Steph invited me out to her school's skit night.  I've never seen this before, and I must say it was rather..... interesting.

Steph was unexpectedly recruited to be in the Senior class skit, a last minute unrehearsed performance.   Needless to say... it was very poorly done :( You were great on stage Steph, it was just that the skit sucked, as I'm sure everyone who saw it would agree, but what do you expect for something that wasn't even supposed to take place?

Several other mind numbing skits went on until the drama club appeared on stage.  I was impressed with their witty performance and interesting skit they had put together, but I suppose that is expected from a drama club.  There were a few other skits that left me amused, and others left me confused.

<lj user=""cybe""> performed for the poetry club, it was interesting to watch him perform, even though they were missing half of the script and improvised the rest.

Afterwards, I drove Steph to meet up with her mom.  Her mom was attending a ""bunco"" game (don't ask because I don't know either).  We sat around, had some complimentary cheesecake and soda.  

That pretty much concludes the night."

"event","I was doing some research and found this:
<blockquote>While minimum wage increases generally receive substantial public support, economists have generally relied on the above analysis to argue that such legislation will result in an increase in the unemployment rate in low-wage labor markets. In recent years, however, a series of studies by David Card, Alan B. Krueger, Lawrence F. Katz, and others have suggested that small to moderate increases in the minimum wage will have no adverse effects on unemployment (and may even lead to reduced unemployment). There are a number of theoretical models that can explain such results. Among these are: 

<ul>
<li> monopsony models, and  </li>
<li>efficiency wage models.</li>
</ul>
 </blockquote>

http://www.swlearning.com/economics/policy_debates/increase_minimum.html

<hr>
And also found:


<blockquote>A solid body of contemporary research has found no job loss resulting from modest increases in the minimum wage. For example, research by the Economic Policy Institute found that the 1996 and 1997 minimum wage increases did not cause job loss. There was no negative employment effect among either teens or adults. In fact, adults actually experienced a small, though not statistically significant, increase in employment.* 
EPI found that raising the minimum wage did not reduce the employment of minorities and women. Raising the minimum wage was associated with statistically significant employment increases among teenage Latinas, less-educated adult women and less-educated adult African American women. For whites and for African Americans overall, the minimum wage increase resulted in neither significant positive nor negative employment effects. 
According to a 1999 study by the Jerome Levy Economics Institute, the last increase in the minimum wage did not affect the overwhelming majority of small businesses. Nine out of 10 (89.1 percent) of the small businesses surveyed said the last increase did not have an effect on their employment or hiring decisions. </blockquote>
http://www.aflcio.org/yourjobeconomy/minimumwage/myths/myths7.cfm

<hr>


But also in defense of keeping the minimum wage, and not increasing it:

<blockquote>    It has been well documented that the minimum wage destroys jobs, particularly the jobs of low-skilled, young workers. However, there are other equally pernicious side effects of higher minimum wages. Higher minimum wages make it more difficult for people to leave welfare and induce high-school students to drop out. 

     Dr. Peter Brandon of the Institute for Research on Poverty studied how raising the minimum wage affect the transition from welfare to work. [7] He found that raising it keeps welfare mothers on welfare longer. Mothers on welfare in states that raised their minimum wage remained on welfare 44 percent longer than mothers on welfare in states where it was not raised.[8] 

     The reason for this result is that raising the minimum wage induces some people to enter the labor market who would not apply if not for the higher level. With a larger labor market, employers choose higher-skilled applicants. Thus, raising the minimum wage hurts low-skilled workers in two ways. First, there are fewer jobs available. Second, with a larger pool of applicants, competition is stiffer. Low-skilled workers have a more difficult time getting those job skills that are crucial to economic well-being. 

     Another side effect of raising the minimum wage is that it increases the number of high-school students who drop out. [9] Some of these students do not find employment. Another group of students are part of those applicants that compete jobs away from welfare recipients. Dropping out of school is very destructive. High school drop-outs have a very difficult time improving their well-being. </blockquote>
http://www.house.gov/jec/cost-gov/regs/minimum/against/against.htm

<hr>


<blockquote>Increasing the minimum wage will do little to improve the conditions of poor Americans. Relatively few of those workers who receive wages at or near the minimum are members of poor families. For those poor who are working, wage increases are substantial and come quickly as they accumulate job experience. Increasing the minimum wage will, however, eliminate entry-level jobs for unskilled workers, making it more difficult for those who want to work to find jobs.</blockquote>
http://www.heritage.org/Research/Labor/tst042904a.cfm

<hr>

Personally, I'm not sure if I'm for or against it, since I don't it affecting me immediately since myself, and everybody that I know makes more than minimum wage.  Even though I did vote for it, I can't strongly back that decision, nor can I support being against it.   You have people who have researched this, some say it will have little effect, some say it will hurt jobs.  Poverish communities could benefit from a minimum wage increase, it could be a step closer for families to overcome poverty.  Then again, it could also make it more difficult for people to find jobs if employers can't afford to hire.  I've tried to research the minimum wage increase that occured from 1996 to 1997, but came back with inconclusive results."

"event","Well... let's see...

We start off the day well having an extra hour.  I didn't get a chance to use that hour to sleep because I couldn't go back to sleep after I woke up at 7:30.  I kept having so many thoughts go through my mind and having these awful nightmares that kept me up.  I got so frustrated and upset that I couldn't get back to sleep, I decided I'd just wake up around 9 am (for those of you that know me, know this is VERY early for me on a weekend since I usually wake up past 12).  

A few hours later, my brother woke up.  I was hungry, and so was he.  I figured we could both go out and grab a bite to eat together, so we did.  We ended up going to Pollo Tropical (I think it was formerly named TropiGrill).   I was soo hungry at the time that I ordered the 1/2 chicken meal, which was very filling, and I couldn't even finish it all.  My eyes were much bigger than my stomach.   The funny thing is... there was this old guy in front of me.  He decided to throw on a few spices at the spice counter onto his rice.  He started off with some barbecue sauce on his chicken and on his rice.  He then reached for the Tabasco sauce.  For those of you that have used Tabasco sauce, you know that there is a plastic cap on top with a tiny little hole so that when you shake the bottle upside down, little tiny drops are sprinkled onto your food.  I'm sure this old guy thought this too, and proceeded to begin sprinkling it onto his food.  Well...  he quickly realized that it wasn't sprinkling.... he POURED it onto his food.  The plastic ""restrictor plate""  wasn't on the bottle and he poured a ton of it on there.  I felt pretty bad for him.  I couldn't help but watch him to see if he would eat it.  I saw him taking a spoon and spooning off the sauce from his food.  Surprisingly he still ate it.

Ok, now that we're done with lunch, we went to the Mitsubishi dealership where my brother wanted to test drive an Eclipse, particularly a V6 manual transmission Eclipse with the premium package.  Unfortunately they didn't have that, so he test drove a manual 4 cylinder model, and an automatic V6 model.  Needless to say, neither of us were very impressed.   We were slightly pleased with the interior, but not really wowed over by anything.

There was a Toyota dealership on the way back home, and I decided to go there to test drive the Toyota Prius, Toyota's hybrid gas/electric vehicle which gets amazing gas mileage.  I'm looking for a daily driver car that doesn't consume as much fuel as my car does.  They were out of Priuses and won't get any available for who knows how long.  They told me that there is a guy that has been waiting 9 months to get one and still doesn't have it.  I asked what would be a car that they have that has great mileage.  They suggested the Corolla.  I sat in the Corolla, and was immediately turned off by the fact that it had manual windows.  I insisted that I need power windows, so they showed me the Corolla XRS.  I asked to test drive it, the sales guy headed in to get the keys, and then when he came back, pulled the car out to the front.  He handed me the keys and then told me to take it for a drive and then bring it back to the parking lot when I'm done.  After he left, I looked at my brother with a surprised and excited look.  This was our chance to really test out the car ;-) ::snicker::.  Not one to waste any time,  I threw the shifter into first gear, slammed on the gas pedal.  ""Screeeeeeech"", the tires spun as the vehicle responded to the gas pedal.   She quickly reached 8,000 RPMs!!!!   That's right, 8,000 RPMs!! That's where it starts to redline.  I threw the shifter into second gear, and she quickly reached 60 MPH.   Laughing with excitement and shock, my brother and I were both highly impressed with what this tiny front wheel drive, 1.8L engine can do.  This is a Corolla, a family sedan, not a sports car, but surprisingly performed almost to par with my TransAm, definitely outperformed the Eclipse.  I had a new found respect for the tiny 1.8L VVTi (Variable Valve Timing Induction) engine.  I scoffed at the thought of a tiny engine being able to perform well, but that's changed now.   Once I get close to paying off my TransAm, I am almost sure that I'd end up getting a Corolla.  I'd still keep my baby for the nights and weekends to have some fun with, but it's just not practical in daily heavily congested traffic.  

Ok... now a change of events...

I headed off to Steph's house where I donned my costume, which was called ""Minister of Death"" at Party City.  I saw Steph already wearing her costume.  It was not the costume I was expecting her to wear.  I was expecting her to wear a costume that resembled more of a Vampress, but instead she was some sort of Priestess.   The funny thing is,  I had no idea what costume she chose, and I happened to pick the costume that coordinated with Steph's.  That is what I wanted, I wanted us to be coordinating, but this happened purely by coincidence.... or perhaps it was fate?  I began to apply the makeup to my face.  Being a guy, I didn't have much experience in this field, so Steph helped me with my makeup.  

After that was done, we headed off with me driving in her car.  We stopped for a bite where everyone was in awe of our presence enjoyed our costumes.  I even heard a little kid say ""Look at that costume, it's kewl!!"".  We then arrived a Caroni's place for her Halloween party.  I thought it was Mallory's place initially because Steph kept saying ""Mallory's party"".  I must say, Steph and I really enjoyed ourselves, and I was very happy being there with her.  Alex came along with us too, but was very quiet and secluded.   I quickly made friends with a lot of the people there and really enjoyed myself.  I learned a few new dance moves while I was there too!  Yes yes, I know what you're thinking... I know I'm already a great dancer from years of DDR practice, but yes, even ""Fast feet Makoto"" learned a few new moves.  The five hours that we were there seemed to fly by pretty quickly.

As it started to get late, I insisted that we leave so that Steph could head home and get some sleep for school tomorrow.  She fell asleep on my arm in the car, and it was soooo cute.  After today, I feel like I've gotten a lot closer to her and I even trust her a lot more now too.  I just could not see myself with anybody else but Steph now.  I'm not afraid to let the whole world know about how I feel about her.  

Well... it's about 2:00 AM now, I should be heading off to bed.   I was just so happy and excited today that I couldn't help but write a lot.  I got to see Steph smile a lot and saw her happy and enjoying herself.  That really made my day, and has still left me with a great big smile and in a great mood.  I wish I could capture the happiness that she brings me in a jar, but I don't think there is a jar big enough in this world to hold that much happiness and joy.  

Sorry for the long post, I am just so happy I couldn't help myself.  Time to go to bed, g'night everybody!"

"event","Well... I started off my day waking up, went to the mall so that I can pick up some fangs for Steph.  I also reserved a copy of Halo 2 at EB Games.  

I was on my way to Steph's for her Halloween party, and then I got a call from her asking me if I picked them up, which I did, but I then realized that I forgot them at home, so I had to turn around and go back to pick them up.  The things I do for her.

I sped on my way back to her place, averaging about 90 MPH on Narcoosee, and 75 MPH on Moss Park Road, and then about 55 MPH on Lake Mary Jane since there were two cars in front of me.  She insisted that I hurry and speed, so I glady complied, got to ""benchmark"" my car every now and then.

When I got there, everyone was upstairs watching the old classic Dracula.  I got a chance to meet the famous Alex that Steph has told me about many times.  Didn't talk to him much though.  I tried to start up a conversation, but it just didn't catch on.  I could tell something was bother him, especially when Stephanie started to kiss me.  It's almost as if he was jealous, and there was this ""tension"" between us that I could sense.  Did anybody else notice this too?  There was something bothering Steph for most of the time, I think it's the way that Alex was acting.  I was able to cheer her up later on in the night and see her smile, and that really made me happy.  

For the most part, the party didn't go as well as I would have liked, could have been much better.  Needed more games, DDR and apple bobbing would have made it more exciting.   At the party, we watched some old ""horror"" movies, and then we went out in the woods to hunt for sticks to roast marshmallows on.  After playing in the woods, we went to the boat dock to watch fireworks.  I had a chance to light one up, could feel the entire boat dock vibrate from the impact of the mortar shell exploding in the launching tube.  After the fireworks, we headed back to the woods where a large fire was already started.  We stood around roasting marshmallows in the fire, and David ended up chipping his tooth with a large Maglite flashlight that he was playing with.   

It was a pretty long day, I don't think I want to get into EVERY little detail, you'd quickly get bored reading all of it.

I ended up getting home around 10 pm.  Yes, that's right, 10 pm.  The party started at around 1 pm, I know what you're thinking, and I thought the same thing, that was very early for a party.  I told my friends that I went to a party, and they were shocked that I was already home."

"event","It's been a while since I've updated, and I think I'm long overdue for a post, and I have a few things I'd like to get off my chest.

A lot has been going on lately.

Let's see...

Looks like I'm getting another job, this time I'll actually be getting benefits and better pay.   I can't stand working for my boss right now, they treat me so unfairly right now.   I can't wait til I officially get this new job so I can tell my boss off on the last day.  My new job will be a Web Developer, pretty much what I do now, but less of the tedious copying/pasting of racing articles that I put up all day long.

I washed and waxed my car on Sunday, this is the shiniest that I've seen my car in months.   I can finally drive her around proudly!   

I've been overwhelmed with my trig homework, this particular chapter requires SOOO much graphing, it's slowing me down greatly.

I just went shopping for a costume and some more presents for Steph's b-day/Halloween party.  I got this costume called ""Minister of Death"", very gothic looking costume.   Can't say what I got for Steph's b-day, but I hope she'll like it.

Speaking of Steph... I love Steph a lot, I really really do, but the thing is, she doesn't always open up and communicate to me, and then she'll get upset at me for bugging her about what's wrong, like she'll say something like ""Why is this always about you?"", and then hang up on me.  I got rather upset with her on the phone tonight and probably was a little mean with her, but I didn't really mean it, just kind of built up inside of me. I've noticed that the only time that I really get upset with her is when she doesn't talk to me.  She'll show that something is obviously bothering her, but she won't tell me what, and I'll have to guess.  It becomes one big guessing game and it makes me very frustrated. She makes me worry a lot, and all this worrying can drain a lot of my energy.   I do love her a lot, but I wish she'd stop making me worry so much, I'm beginning to think she enjoys seeing me worried.
Even though I might get mad at Steph, it would not be enough to make me want to break up with her.  She has so many great qualities that make up for it.

Also... to make things worse, there's a good chance I won't be able to come to Steph's homecoming.  TCHS has a new rule saying that you must currently attend high school, or you must have been a former TCHS alumni, which I don't fit into either.  I hope there's a way I can come along, I've never been to homecoming for my school, so I'd be really happy if my first time going to homecoming was with Steph.

On another note, Chito and his gf stopped by here tonight again.  I've had a chance to speak with her a bit, and I think she's very good for Chito, so I've been real happy for him.

I think I've been stressed out lately, I haven't been sleeping very well, and my appetite hasn't been consistent.  I've been stressed out from work, finances, side jobs that I'm working on, studying, getting ready for this new job, homework, relationship, trying to keep this place clean, making sure the courts have been working on clearing up the mistake of suspending my license, and several other things.  I think I need a vacation, actually, both Steph and I need a vacation.  I know we've both been stressed out, and I'd love to take her out on a nice relaxing vacation, but can't do that right now since we're both in school.

Well...  those are a few things going on in my life, sorry if I bored you with all my writing.

I've got to get back to my homework that's due tomorrow (actually today since it's past midnight)."

"event","As you all might know, we got hit by another hurricane, Jeanne.  Fortunately, it wasn't so bad this time.  I think we are running out of trees for the storms to knock down.

The night before the storm hit, it was very windy outside with no rain yet.   My brother and I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to fly a kite.

We ended up making a kite from a plastic bag, and a hanger around the open end to keep it open.  That idea didn't fly too well. We ran around outside like fools trying to get it up in the air, but no luck.  We headed back inside, to the drawing board, to put together another kite.   We went with the traditional kite design.  We used a large plastic bag and some metal hangers.   It was a rather crude looking kite, but we managed to get it together.  We headed outside to try to get the kite up in the air.  We ran really fast against the wind, but it didn't go up.  We figured we needed more speed and more wind.   We decided to head over to the Kash n Karry parking lot which is deserted since that store went out of business.   I put the top down in my car while my brother held on to the kite.   The wind kept shifting directions which made it almost impossible to fly that kite, especially since I had a very short area to drive in and a big building blocking the wind.   We then proceeded to drive down Valencia College Lane instead, and the wind was just insane.  Well... as I had reached about 45 mph, my brother went ahead and started to release the ""kite"".  The strong wind caused the string to rip, and the kite did not fly :( I think the metal hangers were too heavy.   It was still fun while it lasted.


After the storm finished up, we amazingly still had power at our place, and all did not seem to be too bad.  The winds were very noisy and made it difficult to sleep, but I still managed.


Monday:
I didn't have to go to work today since our power at the office was out.  This was a great day for me.  I started off by going to Barne's and Noble and buying a book.  Got back home, took a quick shower, and then went to Steph's house to take her uncle to the airport.  The tolls were free, so I was able to hop on the Bee Line and get him to the airport in no time.  I could tell he was anxious to get back home.  We then went to grab a bite to eat down the street from the airport at the Cracker Barrel.  I ordered an omelets and mashed potatoes.  So far, Smoky Bones has got one of the best mashed potatoes, Cracker Barrel was a 6 on a scale from 1~10, at least they served it with gravy.  I've been to restaurants that don't have gravy for their potatoes, this is a huge disappointment.    After our lunch, we went back to her place (which we weren't supposed to do).  We sat down and watched some movies.  It was almost too good to be true.  Having her their in my arms all alone made me think about what it could be like in the future with just the two of us.  I would definitely enjoy coming home from work into her arms.  

I ended up staying there the whole night, and I think we went to bed too early.  It was only about 10:00.  Neither one of us were very tired at that moment and had a hard time trying to get to sleep.  Even though I wasn't tired, it was very heavenly to hold her next to me and cuddle up next to her.  I could definitely get used to that.  

I might have had some doubts before whether or not we'd be together forever, but after I spent that night with her, and woke up to her in the morning to make waffles, a lot of those doubts disappeared and I'm becoming more and more sure of what I want with her.  I am not able to express in words how happy I have been with her lately.  I'm just glad that I have met her and have been able to spend this time with her."

We got a new vacuum cleaner recently from WalMart for less than $80.  It really sucks.  Our old vacuum cleaner sucked at sucking, and now this new one does a great job of sucking.  It sucks so great,  especially with the rotating brush, bagless HEPA filter.  

I decided to vacuum my room, but one problem existed:  there was to much junk on my floor.  So... I had to clean up my room, and vacuum it up.  It actually looks nice for once,  very pretty looking, especially with the new glass desk that's in my room.

I was at Steph's on Sunday.  Things started out from bad to worse, but then when we embraced each other, things felt soooo much better.   Yeah yeah, I know this sounds corny, but when we did hold each other, it felt soo great and then I remembered why I love her so much, she has the ability to make me happy easily, even when things are very bad. 

Things at school are going well.  I've gotten all A's on all my tests and quizzes in both classes so far, and I'm actually having fun.  I enjoy math and computers, so I really like my classes.  Making some new friends in class too, so that's a plus.

This weather has been nice lately, much cooler than what it normally is.  I can't wait for the weather to cool off again.  I love the nice cool breeze in the fall."

I spent some time with Steph yesterday, they had no power at their place from the hurricane, but had the generator powering up parts of the house.  We sat out in the patio for a while, and then when we came back in, noticed that there were more lights on than there should be, quickly realizing the power had came back on.    The power crews are working amazingly hard to restore power.  Got Steph's power back on much quicker than Charley, and my power was only out for a couple hours instead of a couple days.

We ended up watching Good Will Hunting last night in the living room and snacking on some pizza rolls that we cooked in the oven.  We made quite a team when it came to cooking, she prepared it, I preheated the oven and put the tray in, she took it out and then we ate it.  

Just wanted to let everyone know that I'm doing fine after the hurricane.  Not so much damage and debris as when Charley hit, and I've been taking advantage of the free toll roads."

"event","Well... sure enough, we got hit hard here in Orlando.  Hurricane Charley came straight for us and was unrelentless.  I was outside watching the storm and even captured it on video tape.  Trees were in a horizontal position from the winds blowing so hard.   What I thought first to be lightning actually turned out to be bright flashes from transformers blowing up and electrical shortages.

Fortunately, our apartment did not sustain any major damage.  There are many trees that have been uprooted and knocked over, debris all over the place.  Our power was only out for 2 days, not too bad compared to some people who still don't have power.  It was a tough 2 days, battling the humid heat with no air conditioning was a bit rough.  I've had to fill the freezer with ice a couple times to keep the items in there cold, although almost everything in the fridge spoiled anyways.

My office has no phone or cable at the moment, so I've been working out of my house which has been such a great luxury.   Not having to drive so far to my office, and not having to put up with my annoying boss.

I'm in less of a panic this year than the previous years, I guess it's because we had a short notice, and after a lot of close calls, I am starting to think that we won't get hit anymore, but this time it's a sure thing.

2004/08/07

Instead of

It makes sense to put the year first, you start with the most significant part of the date, working down to the least significant part.

YEAR/MONTH/DATE


Just like when you put a time, you don't put the seconds first, then the hours then the minutes, it is hours:minutes:seconds.

Even this LiveJournal realizes this, look how they format the date:

""makotosan (makotosan) wrote,@ 2004-08-09 15:38:00""

That's right, YEAR-MONTH-DATE.

This also makes it much easier to sort items if it is named like this.

If you have something named  ""08-07-2004.jpg""  and ""12-25-2001.jpg""  You compare the digits going from left to right, and since 1 is greater than 0, 12-25-2001.jpg would be listed first even though this is not correct.

If you had something named ""2004-08-07.jpg"" and ""2001-12-25.jpg""  2004 is greater than 2001 and this would be sorted accurately.

When we were stuck inside the house, we used to spend a lot of time together, playing around, playing video games together, etc etc.    Now that we both have cars and jobs, things have changed.  Does this make me more boring? I hope not :(

I find things that used to be fun and exciting to be a bit dull now.  I used to go play billiards often, and sneak into hotels to use their pools, but I don't get any thrill to do that anymore.  Lately, I find enjoyment in just spending time with my friends, whether it's at the apartment, or at a restaurant, or in doing group activities such as  rock climbing.  I also enjoy spending time with my gf Steph.  

On a completely unrelated subject, I've been feeling much more stressed out today, I think it's because the AC isn't working at it's peak here in the office, and it's 76 degrees in here, even though I have it set to 70.  The condensation drain is clogged and causing water leakage, and a bucket is catching all the leakage.  It's too stuffy in here."

It's been raining a lot here lately.  Some reason, I have a tendency to feel tired when it rains.   I went to bed at around 1:00 in the morning on Sunday, and woke up at 3:00 pm, and I'm blaming the rain for me sleeping 14 hours.  Haven't been able to get anything done like change my oil either.

Let's see here....

So far, I've been putting some time in starting up my business, got my logo finished, business cards are coming soon, advertising in the phone book starts November, got my Employer ID Number from the IRS, request for fictitious name (need this for a business name) is in progress.  Now I just need to start working and I'll be bringing in some big bucks... hopefully.

Nothing exciting to mention at the moment.

<b>Saturday Recap:</b>
I woke up uber early on Saturday, woke up at 7:45 am, which is VERY early for me on a Saturday since I normally wake up at 12 or so.  Went to go meet up with Steph at her school for Pack Is Back day.  We walked around and got everything she needed to prepare for school such as books, schedule, locker, parking pass.  Afterwards, we had breakfast at the 5 & Diner.   I was disappointed with my omelette, they used a square slice of cheese on top of it, that was just cheap.  They should have used shredded cheese.  I will never get an omelette from them again.  

After breakfast, we met up with some of Steph's friends at the movie theatre in the Wateford Lakes Town Center.  We ended up watching Collateral.  It was a pretty good movie, good storyline and good action, but a little slow paced at times.  Steph obviously didn't find it very exciting since she fell asleep during the movie, but I didn't mind, she ended up falling asleep in my arms.

We were originally planning to go to the beach on this day, but the weather conditions at the beach weren't very good so instead, we went to Mal's house and swam in her pool.  We had a good time there.

After the pool, we stopped by and picked up a pizza at Pizza Hut, and took it back to Steph's house, where I forced her to watch ""Da Ali G Show"".  If you're reading this, and you haven't watched ""Da Ali G Show"", you really need to watch a few episodes.  If you have HBO on Demand from Bright House Networks, you can find a few episodes on there.  You can find some episodes online at http://www.suprnova.org too.  There's a character in that show named ""Borat"" and I find him to be absolutely hilarious.  Borat is from a television station in Kazhakstan and is documenting the American culture, such as dating, etiquette, sports, politics, speech, etc etc.   You just have to see him in action, he's just absolutely hilarious.  

Steph quickly found the show to be annoying :( so we watched UHF, followed by another movie, which I can't think of the title at the moment, but it starred David Spade.  


I've also started playing Doom 3 lately.  That game is scary as f***.  I have a friend that can't play that game since it is too scary.  You're walking around, and you hear background noises of machinery and leaking hoses.  All of the sudden, the lights go out.  You turn on your flashlight to light up your path, and you are walking around narrow corridors.  You approach a staircase to go upstairs, when all of the sudden, you hear and see this big monster burst out from it suddenly attacking you.  You just have to try it for yourself to see how scary that game is.  It's an awesome game, but you'll surely find yourself screaming when something jumps at you from nowhere.


That's about it for now.

I'll try to update more often."

I've been using my cell phone as an alarm clock lately, and it's been doing a good job of it, much better than my usual alarm clock.  I can usually sleep through my alarm clock if I'm very tired, I won't even hear it go off.  

Sunday morning, I had this dream that someone kept calling the phone and they wouldn't stop calling.  It was getting very annoying and I kept wishing that they'd stop calling, the phone would just keep ringing and ringing.  I then slowly woke up to the sound of my phone's alarm going off.   I woke up, looked at the phone to turn off the alarm when I noticed that I have one new text message.   I checked the text message to find out that she had sent me the info about her arriving flight, flight number, airline, and arrival time.  

I went online and went to Delta.com to confirm the arrival time and arrival destination.  Tampa International Airport at 11:00 am.   It was about 8:45 when I woke up.  I spent a few minutes getting ready, taking a shower, getting directions to the airport, and then stopped to fill up my tank with gas.    I hit the road by about 9:30.   After about 30~40 minutes of driving, I headed into the rain storms.  Heavy rains and low traction tires slowed me down significantly.  By the time I got there, it was about 11:15, I was late.  I went to the gate that she was supposed to arrive at, and asked the lady at the information desk if their flight has passed through yet.  Fortunately, she told me that the flight is slightly delayed and isn't scheduled til 11:20.   It was about 11:40 that she passed through and I greeted her as she arrived.  It was very great to see her again after two and a half weeks of her being away.   I went to go drop her off at home, and then returned home to go back to sleep.  I was still very tired since I had went to bed at  around 4:00 am the night before.  

My mother had planned to come over to bring some food over for my brother's b-day.  After throwing out all of our cheap plastic cups a few days ago, I realized that we no longer have any nice cups or glasses to drink out of.  I quickly hurried to Publix to get some new cups and glasses.  We finally have some nice looking drinking glasses.  

They brought over some pizza and a cake.  

Afterwards, I went back to Steph's to return her hamster that I was watching while she was away, gave me an excuse to go over there too.  

While in Michigan, she had found this old tourist book from Japan with some old, yet interesting, pictures in it.  Very interesting to see how the culture has changed.  She also gave me this ring with a falcon on it, a little kitten (not a real kitten), a post card with a picture of the Ramsdell Theatre that she adores very much, and some authentic Mackinaw Michigan fudge.  

That pretty much concludes my day so far."

I headed off to the Florida Mall right after work since I'm just a couple miles away from it.  I headed off to my favorite value priced brand name department store Old Navy.  Let me just add this side note... Alfredo, his gf Andrea and I went to the Fashion Square Mall on Sunday, and I checked out Express.... I saw shirts going for $60!!  Not a shirt made of exotic silk or anything, just a normal shirt.  I browsed around Old Navy for a while and found some shirts and pants that I liked and decided to try them on.  Everything fit the first time I tried it on and fit comfortably too.  Nice loose pockets to fit my stuff in, enough room to move.   I ended up walking up to the register with three pairs of pants and two shirts.  Guess how much three pairs of pants and two shirts cost.... only $77.45, that's practically a steal. 

Steph also called last night and I had a chance to talk to her.  Told her that her hamster is doing well in my care and that I was looking forward to her return.  It's been a long time since I've seen her, I've really missed her being around.

She sent me a letter a few days ago and it was a very sweet letter.  She really opened up and showed a more emotional side of herself that really made me feel special."

I was driving home from work on Thursday, and on my way home, my car started vibrating awfully and making an annoying and loud clicking sound, actually, more like a banging.   My battery guage dropped and my steering became more difficult.  I pulled into the closest gas station while my car is making these awful sounds to see what's wrong.  

I pop open the hood and notice that the harmonic balancer is vibrating like crazy and shut off the car.  I called up AAA (if you own a car, AAA is a must) and got a tow truck to come about about an hour and a half later.   I ended up going home around 8 o'clock, and some reason, I fell right asleep, and slept for the duration of the night.  

The next morning, I got ready for work, but then realize I can't drive my car to work.  I stayed home that day and worked from my house, Friday's are usually real slow anyways so it worked out well.  Even though I got to bed early, I was still very tired and kept taking naps.  I eventually got up and went to the parts store to get the part to fix my car.   Swapped out the harmonic balancers, and my baby was purring like a lion again.   The old harmonic balancer fell apart into two pieces when I took it off.

Afterwards, I met up with Steph's parents since I agreed to take care of her hamster while she's away from town.  I now have in my posession a nice playful hamster.

"event","A few weekends ago I was fishing....it was really cold....and it was before the sun came up.  I was sitting there think about why I never really had any ""heroes"".  Then I realized that I'm not odd for not having any!  what the fuck is a hero?!?!  Someone....or some thing that we thing is the greatest and can do no wrong.  That's bullshit.  People are people, and I'm sure whoever your hero may be probably does something that would repulse you.  Instead of heroes I believe in inspiration.  I have had many inspirations for just about everything I do.  A few teachers, a few musicians, some photographers, etc.....etc.  I do not think of them as superior people that are better than anybody else.  Everyone has the things they are good or great at, but they no better of a person....right?  When people have heroes they have false hopes, and that is a lot of weight on the shoulders of whoever the hero is.  So fuck heroes!!!.....just be inspired by someone/thing.  It's easier in the long run and you won't be let down."

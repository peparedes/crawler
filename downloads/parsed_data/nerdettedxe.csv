"event","So lately i've been so confused about so much...
I feel as though I'm a jinga game and that if you pull one more piece i will fall.
the strings that have been holding me up are being cut apart;
i know that it's up to you to make you happy but that cant always be the case...
why can't things just run smother and be nicer...
i hate it.. i honestly do.
brit and ashley are my support system
with out them i'd fall on my face.. but idkkk..
-sigh-"

"event","So nothing really extremely eventful has happened lately.

Friday i felt so horribly sick i thought i was going to pass out at any point Brandy tired her best to make me feel better; I'm very greatful for that. I was grounded so i didn't go to the mall Witch pissed me off; but i got over it i suppose..

Saterday I went to albany did some stuff out thier; came home tired to call Rachael like 450759048 Times because I wanted her &amp; mike to come to the mall to hang out; but i couldn't get hold of rachael. SO i told mike Never mind, I went to the art store got some shit [Not That i honestly need anymore art stuff haha =X] got home and was working on a paint when RACHAEL&lt;333 called. We talked and sence she couldn't come here I went to her house. We ended up calling bonz &amp; him and jeff came and got me and rachael and we got kate; we drove around, stoped at central park, wally world, &amp; the locks. Some part where fun; some i rather very much so regert; but it's life. You can only live ONE day at a time.

Sunday came home from rachaels and waisted my life away as normal...

Today- well what would have been Five years today OBVIOUSLY isn't, I have to live with my fuck up my regerts and it's eatting me up inside, I ran out that door went 3 hours again and expected everything to be okay. But i was unprepared to loose the love of my life; i'm sure that i'm stupid for it because not one person has made up for that void. and most people make me feel like they don't care about me or are using me for something I FUCKING HATE IT.. I hate feeling like i'm a horrible person for nothing; i fucking hate feeling like a scum bag; i give up on most people, growing apart and trying to hold on isnt' cutting it anymore. So i talked to bonz most of the time after school discussing saterday &amp; what not; he help me out tonight alot when i was really depressed he's a good friend to me; a very good one."

I don't want them to worry about me, but I've never been good at putting on a 'happy face'.  How am I supposed to keep them settled when I can't even do it for myself?

"event","Maybe this shouldn't be here, but I've been watching a few people lately.  I find it strange how interactions between people change as time goes by, all depending on how they end up feeling about each other.

It's probably one of the reasons why Maxwell always teases me about Relena.

I've been here too long.  I made a promise... and now I can't keep it.  I wonder how the others are doing without us.  Relena...

I've been reading when I haven't been working on the extra farm shifts.  We have a lot of new people.  Marie's in a hut with mostly new people, too.  None of us know any of them.  I'll have to keep an eye on them.

However, she is on the same farm shift with me.  That will make some things easier."

<lj-cut text=""Duo goes to tell Heero about Mariemeia."">Duo had shown Marie his room and let her go lay down.  She was still feeling a bit off from whatever the kidnappers had used to knock her out so they could dump her through the portal.  At least, that's what he was guessing on how she got here.  She didn't remember, having been unconscious at the time.

He also hadn't seen her arrive... having come upon her just waking up near the farm.

After she had drifted off to sleep, he headed out to find Heero.  Sure, he should be working today, but this was more important than some stupid farm that no one was watching him to make sure he actually did what he was supposed to.

""Hey, Heero..."" he tapped on the hut's door.  The slightly more anti-social than normal Japanese pilot opened the door.

""What?""  Duo blinked.

""Uhh... hey.""  The American frowned a bit.  ""I uhh... Well, Mariemeia's here.""  Might as well just come out with it, right?  Now it was Heero's turn to blink and frown.

""Mariemeia...""  He sighed.  ""Where is she?""

""She's over at my place, right now,"" Duo said.  ""Taking a nap.  I think she's had kind of a rough time of it.""  Heero nodded.

""Is she alright?""

""She seems to be, considering,"" Duo said.  ""She said some guys kidnapped her and knocked her out with some sort of drug or something.  I didn't actually look her over for injuries, but she didn't say anything was bothering her other than being tired.""

""Hn.""  Heero glanced back behind him for a moment and then headed back into the living room.  Duo stepped up into the doorway.  He watched as Heero finished up something on his laptop and closed it.

""Still trying to hack the firewall?""  Heero nodded.  ""I'm starting to wonder if there's a even a physical connection to outside,"" Duo said.  ""I mean... if there's no cable, then there's no need for a firewall... and it can't be hacked anyway.""

""We should find the server,"" Heero suggested as they stepped outside and closed the door.

""Yeah... might not be a bad idea... if only we knew where to look.  We've been almost all over this place...""

""Hn.""

""So what are you thinking?""

""I want to make sure Mariemeia's okay,"" Heero said as they started walking towards Duo's hut.

As they walked, Heero spotted several rather energetic people almost bouncing their way across the village.  If anything, the village was an exercise in extremes.  Between all the moodiness at one end of the spectrum, and all the happiness at the other...

""There's a lot of genki here,"" Heero remarked flatly.

""Genki?""  Duo looked confused.

""You.""

""Me? What'd I do?""  Duo looked over his shoulder for a moment.

""You're genki,"" Heero corrected him, sounding slightly annoyed.

""I'm genki?""  Duo frowned.  ""No I'm not!""  There was silence between them for a moment.  ""Um... what's that mean, anyway?""  Heero smirked slightly.

""It means energetic.""

""Oh...""  Duo looked thoughtful for a moment again.  ""Well, nothing wrong with that then, right?""  Heero just shook his head.  ""It's better than having a stick up your ass... or being moody.""  Duo poked his friend in the shoulder.  Heero just glared at him.  ""Case in point,"" Duo said, clearly not bothered by the glare.  Heero turned and kept walking.</lj-cut>"

Tags to Kira if he wants to realize there are two strangers crawling all over his Gundam.  ~_^  You honestly all didn't think I would leave that alone when he said Freedom was out the desert, did you?  *grin*

<lj-cut text=""Heero and Duo discover something familiar..."">Since it was their day off, Heero and Duo decided to do some snooping around.  Going beyond the village and the farm, Heero was curious on just how far away they could get.  They didn't go far this time, scanning the horizon as they circled, since they didn't want to wander off and get lost in the desert.  They didn't have the supplies for something like that.

Not that it couldn't be taken care of to try in the future...  But that was for later.

""Hey... you see that?"" Duo asked, pointing off at something in the distance.  It was reflecting light.  Heero nodded.  ""Wanna check it out?""  Heero gave a quick glance back at the village for a moment and then nodded again.

""Let's go,"" he said.  The two trekked out to the object, noticing they were still able to see the village from its location.

""Shit... Heero... that's...""  Duo stopped once they got a clear view.  ""That's a Gundam.""  Heero frowned.

""It's not one I've seen before,"" he said.

""Me, neither.""  They broke apart, circling it in opposite directions.  Heero climbed up on it.  Duo watched him.  ""Is it open?""  Heero nodded.  Duo made his way onto the Gundam as well, wincing a bit.  His side wasn't hurting as much, but it was still sore enough to be annoying.  When got up there, Heero had slipped into the cockpit.  ""So?"" Duo asked, leaning over to look in.

""It's not functioning,"" Heero said.

""Nothing?""

""No power...""  Duo looked back, but the powerplant access panel would have been buried in the sand.  And, without power, they couldn't get the thing to stand up to reach it.

""Crap.""  He turned and eased himself off the side.  He brushed some sand from the side of the Gundam, hoping just maybe there'd be an access hatch he could get to in order to check the power plant on the thing.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Heero and Duo are thinking a bit too much...?"">Heero watched as Duo left the farm after his work day.  He noticed the fact that Duo wasn't trying as hard to hide the fact that he was hurt anymore.  That could be both a good thing and a bad thing.  He walked over.

""I really haven't found anything different from what you've told me so far,"" he said.

""Yeah... me, neither,"" Duo said.  He frowned a bit.  ""It's getting kinda frustrating, you know?  I mean, does this mean we're like stuck here or something until whoever brought us here gets bored?""  He looked up a bit at the sky.  ""What if they get bored and forget about us?  Just leave us here?""

Heero gave Duo a weird look.

""Yeah...""  Duo looked away.  ""Nevermind.""

Duo's attitude bothered Heero.  They'd both been watching the journals... looking for hints, seeing if anyone else had found anything that might lead them home... and Heero noticed that Duo had gotten rather expressive in his last couple of posts.  He found it slightly odd, yet, what Duo had written sort of bothered him.  He was starting to sound like Wufei had last year when Mariemeia had led an attack on the Earth.

Not that they were wrong... but Heero had found there were other things to do.  It wasn't easy to fit in, that was for certain, but he had managed to get along.

Of course, he was having that dream again...

""What's with you?""  Heero blinked.  Duo was a few steps ahead of him and had turned back when he noticed Heero stop walking.  Heero shook his head.

""Nothing.""  He caught back up with him.

""I wanna go back and get cleaned up,"" Duo said.  ""You coming back with me or what?""

""Sure.""</lj-cut>"

It was Duo's idea.

Either way, I have no idea what to do on a farm.  I wasn't trained for this.

I also don't know what to say on here.  <strike>I've never been good at expressing myself...</strike>  I watched Tsukiyono brush the horses again this past Monday.  He did it last week, too.  He's been avoiding the barn since the incident two weeks ago.

Heero had moved around the back of the hut, only to hear someone leave out the front.  As he made his way around again, he spotted something that hadn't been there before.

A full fledged farm...

He blinked.  How had he missed that?  There were animals and everything!

Just what kind of place was this?  He started over that way, noticing that a few others had gone in to investigate the various buildings.  He paused at the fence, watching the animals for a moment, and then headed over towards the barn.

"event","Alright so I haven't wrote in this for along time but I decided it was about time


First off this is kind of ackward b/c I feel like no1 cares and I feel wierd telling everyone exspecially by writing a journal but things are about to change quickly and I rather people know then have people coming up to me asking me questions and stuff

Alright im going to try and keep this short but..

It all started a litle over a year ago when my moms ""friend"" showed up at some baseball thing that we were working at and then this same ""friend"" showed up when me and my mom were going schools shopping. I was asked to keep it a secret and I did. It was extremely hard keeping this from my father and it was hard trying to deal with it all on my own. Obviously i was upset b/c i knew what was going on

My parents began to fight to a point where I couldnt fall asleep at night because of it and to a point where I would avoid the family because I could not deal with the constant fighting. From there on things began to change rapidly. My mom started going out and not coming home until 3 am, she slept on the couch instead of in her room, and soon my dad started changing idk if it was for the worst or for the best, he basicaly started acting extremely nice to try and get my mom ""back"" one of the hardest parts of all this was seeing my dad so upset.

One day last october my parents sat me down and told me that they were going to file for a divorce which came no surprise to me but I guess its one of those things where you dont want to belive it is really happening.

Its one of those situations where you had to be there through it all to understand what truely went on and how hard it really has been.

Knowing that my own mom did this to my father has made me lose alot of respect for her but she will always be my mom so therefore I will always love her.

I know that divorce has sadly became much more common and im sorry if any one feels like I am complaining or anything but if you dont want to listen to me then dont read this I never made you read it is the first place.

So much has gone on and its hard to believe that I was able to hold it all in and hide it from the rest of the world...

The worst things about it have to be being caught in the middle between my parents, having to deal with her ""friend"" who has done some things that have made me lose respect for him ( he sends me flowers and tells me how hot i am and he calls ryans cell phone and swares at him hes just not what i need right now but i cant make my mom not like him), its hard to see my little brothers so clueless, its EXTREMELY hard to see my dad so hurt, and most of all its hard to sit here and just see my family fall apart Ryan has lost all respect for my mom my nana and popa cry and say they dont want it to happen its just hard like my familys all against eachother and most of them are mad at my mom for what she did and i understand but then again shes my mom ya know

My mom had to start a job so the end half of my summer was spent babysitting my brothers every day : \

I ways always the one who said gosh that must be so hard to have your parents divorce im so glad mine are still together..........and now this is what I get

So its finally all final my mom moves out the 8th (tomarrow)(its kind of good : \ maybe things will be a little easier now idk) and luckily my mom got a condo right on the corner of 24 and Hayes so i wont be far at all from my dads and its a really wierd schedual but ill be living with both but if you ever need to talk to me calling my cell will probabley be your best bet


And I want to take the time now to say sorry if I have changed I probably dont seem as happy or maybe as nice but its really hard exspecially when you are trying to hide it and im sorry if i have cried or got upset in front of you and told you it was nothing or that i didnt want to talk about it or said that it was b/c of a boy

And im sorry for those people that i may not be as close to anymore exspecially those few that feel like Patrick has replaced them but he is the only one who knew and sometimes instead of going out on a friday night or something i just needed to sit at home and talk to him and sometimes i am just not in the mood to do anything

And please no1 take it personally that i didnt tell you before exspecially Alicia and my other close friends its just that i felt and feel like no1 cares and that i should b so upset b/c alot of people have to go through it and most of all i feel like you guys have you little b/fs or g/fs and stuff and i dont want to bother you with my problems


lastly i wanna say a HUGEEE thank you to Patrick for everything he has been there for me through EVERYTHINGGGG he has been my shoulder to cry on hes been there to listen to me bitch about life and hes been there to cheer me up when i needed to the most i owe you soooo much and to Jon b/c he was also there for me





I have to stay strong......."

"event","Well today i woke up finished some last minute wrappin and got all ready and stuff then around 2 we headed to my g mas house chad called he was working dat must suck lol then i got to my g mas socialized and stuff lol ate dinner opened presents dat kind of stuff then we normally go to mid nite mass but we decided to go to 7 o clock mass so im home really early this christmas eve lol but im happy lol i would still b sititn at my g mas lol 



today was ok it had its probs this morning i was doin my info and i satarted to think about stuff and i started crying idk how she feels about like everyone knowin so i wont say who but idk im not related to her and i dont hardly no her but i guess there hole familys like my family ya no and i hate to see my bff go threw it i guess ill jsut keep praying that everythings gonna b ok but idk it just really made me think like how would u feel knowin this is yoru last christmas??


then we couldnt like even get out of da hosue on time b/c once again everyone was fighting idk like its amazing its chritmas eve people stop fighting


and church was kinda messed up but w/e not gonna get into it



just gotta keep smiling and enjoy the holiday 



christmas is sapouse 2 b a time of happyness and gathering with friends and family i honestly cant say this christmas has been like that so far but my hope for u all is that u have a VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS and u r able to have a happy joyful celebration with your family


and the presents arent really wat christmas is about christmas is most importantly about celebrating jesus and wat he gave us its a time to celebrate with your loved ones seariuosly u never no wat could happen within this next year u never no when u may lose a loved one



and i know we all including me r worried about wat santa will bring us and if we will get EVERYTHING we want but did u ever take a second to think about the less fortunate people who wake up and have no presents under the tree or those who cant even afford a christmas dinner we all take soo mcuh for granted i want everyone to take time to think this christmas about eveyrthing u r blessedwith and dont take it for granted go give yoru grandma a kiss and tell her u love her go hug yoru other brother or sister and let them no u love them instead of asking mom y didnt u get me thissss or w/e and bein all bumed about it think about the kids who didnt get anything for christmas those kdis r prob just greatful they eve have a roof over thier head



and lastly....


while your sitting at home opening your presents or having dinner or whatever your doing take a minute out and pray for the families who have someone they love out in Iraq fighting for us.
^^^^^i stole it from david lol but its said sooo well seariiously think about those solderiers missin out on christmas and the kids who wake up on christmas morning adn daddy or momma isnt there b/c they r in iraq






GOD BLESS U ALL THIS CHRISTMAS




I HOPE U HAVE A VERY VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS






REMEMBER TO ENJOY EVERY SECOND OF IT WITH YOUR LOVED ONES




I love u all and i hope u have a wonderful christmas filled with good times and happiness"

i wanted to update my journal last nite but im glad i thought about things b4 updating b/c last nite i guess i was just really tired and kinda scared that i screwed up once again


well theres alot that i need to get out and stuff but i know no 1 wants to listen to me complain and i thought about things alot today and i decided that i just need to stop worrying and talk to him b4 i start gettin all upset again 


but truely last nite was amazing like i have said b4 like no matter wat shit is goin on in my family when im wit him everything seems to go away and idk how to explain it its just like i feel like everythings gonna b ok and no matter wats goin on in my life he makes me feel stronge and like i can get threw all this and he just like takes all my fears away i cant even describe the way i felt its one of those butterflys in your tummy kind of feelings i guess i was just unbelieveabley happy like happier then i have been in a long while



so im not gonna cry anymore and im not gonna sit around all upset all weekend i gotta smile and b happy i guess i never no maybe i just took it all the wrong way maybe i still have a chance




lets hope...

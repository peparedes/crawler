I was in the living room one day, while he was watching one, and I began to wonder what it would have been like to have lived in the old west as an Apostolic, someone who believed, and lived the true Apostolic message.</font>&nbsp;<font size=""4"">I went to my room, and began to think about it, and some images began to come to my&nbsp;mind, I began to think of ways of desribing what I saw, and this is what&nbsp;I wrote.</font><br /><br /><br /><font size=""4"">We see a young man out on the lonely prairie, hunched on the ground, his face buried in his hands. Dancing in the shadows around and behind him, are red and yellow flames, grey ashes circle his head, carried on the light breeze that is blowing.<br /><br />&nbsp; The ashes and the half-burnt timber that feed trhe fire is all that is left of the young man's cabin, and life. Jake Slanton, the young man, lifts up his head, the tears making tracks in the dirt on his face.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; He swallows. Half formed words come up out of his throat, and into his mouth. ""Ma, Pa.?"" He gets up on his feet and draws closer to the fire, getting as near as he can without the heat burning him up. He circles around to where the bedroom once stood, where now there is nothing but dust and ashes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Jake whirls around, footsteps! he'd heard the sound of boots coming up behind him, causing his nerves to stand on edge.<br />Five years ago, when they had come to this valley, his Pa, his Ma, and himself, his Pa had taught him to always be on awares of strangers, to be kind and courteous to those that he would meet, but not to allow himself to be taken in by anyone.<br /><br />&nbsp; His Pa had taught Him to recognize all sorts of sounds, sounds that meant danger was on the way, from Rattlers, and other types of animals, to the way that the wind would whistle at night. What He'd heard just now was the sound of the meanest, most unpredictable animal that there was. Man.<br />&nbsp; Man had caused what he was seeing now, what had been done to his life. His cabin, his folks, everything he knew, going up in a whirl of smoke and flames. He turned and looked up, his hand settlin' on what seemed to be it's natural resting place. His shootin' iron. As he looked up, however, his eyes settled on what had to be the kindest, most gentlest of faces he had ever seen, next to his pa's of course.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake took what he hoped was a manly stance, as manly as a ten year old could muster, and set his chin. "" What you needin', Mister? we's all burned out here, as you can see. But I am right handy with a Pistol, if that's what you're wantin.'""<br />&nbsp; His hand was already on the butt of the&nbsp;pistol that his Pa had given him for his birthday a couple of months ago, after he had proven himself with with his pa's rifle by shootin' a rattler that was gettin' a mite too close to the cabin for comfort.<br />&nbsp; His Ma had argued that a nine year old boy was still too young to be totin' a firearm, but his Pa had said that he had already proven himself, and so the matter was settled, and&nbsp;Jake got his first pistol.<br />At this point, Jake was aiming to kill another sanke, A human one.<br /><br />The man, whose name was Fred Hanlen, looked down at this young boy who seemed so sure of himself. He seemed so sure of himself. He saw the quick reflexes, the calm, cool expression on his face, his reaction to something that could be a dangerous situation; all of which made Hanlen glad that he had no cause to make trouble for this young man.<br /><br />Fred stuck out his hand, "" Names' Hanlen, Sir, the wife and I saw the smoke from a distance, and figured we'd come on over and see iffen there was any trouble, and what we could do to help if there was."" Hanlen looked up at the flames, which by this time had died down to embers, and the charred ruins that were the remainders of little Jakes' life.<br /><br />Jake kicked at a clod of dirt, his eyes threatening once again to spill over as the incidents which had taken place that day came into his mind once more.&nbsp;<br /><br />He had been out on the south range, lookin' for a couple cows that had strayed a little further than they should've, when he heard a commotion coming from the direction of the cabin. As he looked over that way, he saw clouds of dust and something else.....smoke. a column of black smoke rose towards the sky, covering the brightness of the sun.<br />He turned his horse back in that direction and dug his spurs into it's flanks, his knees pressed hard against it's sides. He had named his horse Cougar, because it had the speed of the animal whose name it shared.<br />&nbsp; As he approached the cabin, he saw what had caused the dust, and the smoke. Rustlers.<br />Jake saw about 15 or twenty rough looking men sittin' on big, stout-lookin' horses. They had rounded up all the cattle that Jake and his Father had worked so long and hard to raise, and were busy herding them out a peice of fence that had been broken down.<br />&nbsp; Jake looked over toward the cabin, and saw a couple of men ridin' away from it, as fast as they could go; He started to ride over towards them, then something caught his eye that turned him cold, and started his hand reaching for his pistol.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His eyes had settled on the lead man, or, more specifically, on the hand that he was waving in the air; signalling that it was time to git.<br />&nbsp; jakes' eyes focused on the man's pinky, on which rested a shiny circle of gold, that had what appeared to be a huge knot rising up out of it's center.<br />&nbsp; Jake knew that ring.it had once belonged to his Pa's ma. His Pa had shown it to him a few years ago, and he had never forgotten it. Mr. Slanton had told him how it had been his Grandma's special keepsake, how his Grandpa had kept it in a special pouch tied around his waist to keep it safe from dust and wear.<br />&nbsp; He had told Jake that it had been his wedding present, when he had married his Ma, and when he was old enough,&nbsp;it would be his.<br />&nbsp;As these thoughts went through Jakes' mind, his pistol leaped into his hand as though he had willed it there, a shout leaped from his belly, soaring through his throat, and out of his mouth. a cold anger gripped him, and the pistol fired all six shots.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The men were murderers. He knew that they had killed his Pa and Ma. He knew that, because, like Jakes' Grandpa, his )Pa too had kept that ringhideden in a pouch tied around his waist, and worn under his shirt. and the only way that that man could have gotten to it was to have searched him. and the only way he could do that was if his pa didn't stop him. all of which meant that this cold hearted animal had to have silenced his pa. forever.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></font></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>"

I called Pastor Domingues, and told him what happened, read it to him, and he was silent for a bit, then said, you are reading that tomorrow in service.<br/>&nbsp;the next morning, I repeated again what had happened, to the congregation, and this is what God gave me to write.<br/><br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size=""6"">'He's calling; will you listen?'<br/><br/><font size=""4"">Is there a people called by my name? is there not a people for whom I died?<br/>Yet, where are they now? why don't I receive their praise, why don't I hear their cries?<br/><br/>Have they turned away from me? forgotten all the things I have done?<br/>Forgotten the persecution I went through, how that in pain I spilled my blood.<br/><br/>I want your praise, I want your worship, but above all I want your life,<br/>I can stones to praise and worship, but I want body, soul, and mind.<br/><br/>What else do I have to do, to show you the way that I care?<br/>How many times must I stress in my word, my child, I am always there.<br/><br/>Haven't you felt me anough yet, to convince you I mean what I say?<br/>That although there are times of dryness, in the desert I am the well in the way.<br/><br/>But still you do not seek me, do not search me with all your heart,<br/>Do not offer yourself a living sacrifice, which is your reasonable part.<br/><br/>I'm asking you now,&nbsp; my children, turn away from all the wrong you have done,<br/>Let me heal you, and bless you, as&nbsp; has never before been seen on my daughters, and sons.<br/><br/>I've given to you of myself, I ask for so little in return,<br/>Just give to me of what you have, then you know you'll never burn.<br/><br/>I'm asking it, my children, what will be your response,<br/>Will you turn away as you have in the past, or will you forever be my daughters, and sons.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>this next one was written in Victorville as well.

"event","This particular entry is to those who do not know me, or maybe not vey much about me.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
as I am sure you do know, my full name is Anthony Ray Belcher, I am 40 years old, born Jan. 8, 1967, in Goldsboro, NC. I have 5 older siblings, I am the youngest, with 2 sis. and 3 bro. my mom was&nbsp;a housewife all of my life, &nbsp;My father was in the Air Force for 22 years, he retired at the rank of Tech Seargent. 
&nbsp;I have lived in several states, ILL, Tx., N.Y, P.A, North and South Carolina, Cali, Ala, Fla, and have visited many others. because of all the moving around that I have done, I never finished high school, but received my GED in Job Corps, in Cali. back in '87 
&nbsp; I received the Holy Ghost when I was about 15 and a 1/2, in '82, in Sumter S.C. counting only those that I have had for one year or more, I have had about 24 Pastors, and my current, and hopefully last, is Pastor Mike Sales, here in Lewisville, Tx. 
I was always the kind of kid that had no thoughts of danger, but whenever something came into my mind that sounded fun, I would try and find a way to do it, pain has never really bothered me, most of the time, I would usually just say, ouch, that really, really hurts, and go on. 
&nbsp;I remember most of the things that I did, mainly because my family will never let me forget them (GRIN) 

one of my first adventtures, that I remember painfully well, happend when I was about 5 years old, when I was in Kindergarten, back in Rantoul ILL, when my dad was stationed on Chanute A.F.B, and we lived in base housing. 
&nbsp; 
We were bussed to off-base schools at that time, and one moening, I dicided that I didn't want to go. I had one sis. Linda, that was 2 years older than me, and Jon, who was 4 years older, that attended the same school as I did, and the other 3, Reena, the eldest, then Oland Ray jr. (known to us all as Ray), then Albert, went to higher grade schools. 

well, on this particular morning, as the bus pulled into the school lot, I deced I would be sneaky and go on back home. I can still remeber almost exactly what I was thinking at the time, and how I came up with this, I really have have no idea, but alot of things I did, I have no idea how i came up with them. 

&nbsp;anyway, as the bus came to a full stop, I waited until everyone else got off, then moved to the back of the crowd, and used the other students as cover as I slid my way to behind the back of the bus. then, being out of sight of everyone else, I began to walk home.&nbsp; 
now, how I walked all the way home, and got past the gaurd at the gate, no one really knows to this day. but what I found out later, was that when my teacher found that I was missing, and asked my sis. Linda if I was ok, or had just stayed home, or what was wrong, and she said that I had come that morning on the bus,. full scale panic had ensued. 
&nbsp; That was back in '73 or '74, and we had one of the first female Principals in the country at that time, and she did not think it would look very good on her record, if one of her students suddenly came up missing. well, by that time, I was home and playing with our don, and all I remember is hearing my mom on the phone, saying I should be there, in school, and then her coming out and seeing me on the carport. I can't remember anything else about it, I guess I got into too much trouble, and suppressed the rest (LOL) 

no, but seriously,. I have done a lot of strange things, and I will tell you about more of them, but the greatest, and most intelligent thing I have ever done, is obey ACTS 2:38, been Baptized in Jesus' name and let God fill me with His Spirit, and speak through me in another language, to show that He is there. 

I will share more stories and thoughts as I go on, but right n ow, I have a million things to write, and a short time to write them. (grin) 

well, here I am back again, sorry it has been so long, we don't have a comp at home (although we are seriously considering getting one). and we have to use the ones at the library, and we can only use them for 2 hours a day. 
and I am trying to do this while I hold Jazlynn, and she sometimes gets fussy when you sit down with her. I have to go God bless.
Hello, again. I am sorry that it has been so long since I have done anything on here. I have been wanting to get back out here, but have been busy, and it has been very hot, and a lot of otherthings. but anyway, I am here again,and have forgotten to bring my notes to add to my articles, so I am just going to update the stories on here, and add a couple more. I have had a burden for several years now to get into the spanish ministry, I have always loved the spanish language, and have always felt a deep burden whenever we come across someone who speaks either no english, or very little, and I am wondering, how can I share the Love, and Word of God, when I cannot even communicate with them? I have always felt so heavy in my heart about this.&nbsp;
&nbsp;well, last week, I was on the UPCI websites, looking for spanish language material, that would help me to learn some of the language, and came across the link for the official website for the Spanish evangelism ministry website, and found there the Email adress for the Director, Bro. Sergio Vitanza, and I sent him an Email, detailing my burden, and telling him everything I have done to date to try to learn the language and so on, and he sent a reply, telling me that he could feel I had a real burden and desire to reach the spanish speaking peoples, and said if I needed any help that he could give in an Email, to get bak in touch with him again. he also sent me the names of the spanish ministry directors for the various districts, so that I could get in touch with them, and maybe find someone local, and touch base with them, to get some more help.
I am really hoping and praying that God will enable me somehow to follow through on this. after all, he put this burden in my heart, I have to trust that He will show he the wayr.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
I am realy hoping that someone is reading this, besides Anna, that is (Grin) I am going to go for now, maybe next time I won't forget my notes, and will be able to finish all of the various stories, and songs, and whatnot. well, God Bless for now. bye"

"event","For most of my&nbsp;life, God has impressed upon me the importance and pure power of worship and Praise.&nbsp;<br />everytime I would get into situations, and things would be too difficult for me to handle, He would always impress into my heart, why arent' you praising me? He has given me many songs, and poems concerning this topic, but this little Bible Study really gets to the heart of it, and examines several instances from Scripture about the power of Praise, and shows the effects of what just praising God will produce. I wrote this back in '95 when I was living in Del Rio, Tx.<br /><br /><br /><br /><font size=""5"">' It's Time to Praise the Lord'<br /><br /><font size=""4"">Ever since the beginning of time, God has desired one thing, Worship and Praise. The Bible tells us that the Angels were created for this purpose, and the very earth&nbsp;praise and worship the Lord(Isa. 6: 1-4) (and the Psa.) Isaiah chptr 6 says that when the Prophet was taken in a vision, he saw the Angels, and he describes what he saw, they were crying one to another, saying, 'HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, IS THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, THE WHOLE EARTH IS FULL OF HIS GLORY'.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; But amidst all this praise and worship, God had a deeper desire. the Word let's us know that Gods' ultimate, deepest desire, is to have someone to praise Him of his own mind, will, and desire, someone that would get to his knees, or stand to his feet, and simply love and praise Him, because he wanted to, and for no other reason.<br />&nbsp;When God created man, for just such purpose, and man fell, God instituted various forms of sacrifice, and rituals, through which man was to show God worship, praise and Love, but man soon took all of that for granted, and it just took on the form of duty, &nbsp;not something from the heart, as God intended.<br />God chose Abraham, and his family, to create a nation, one which was supposed to be His own chosen people, that would worship and praise Him as He truly desired, but they took His commandments, and His sacrifices, and turned them into duties, not something they wanted to do, but something they had to do.<br />through every generation that followed, Isaac, Jacob, and on down, God always tried to stress one thing, if you would praise me, if you would worship me, I will see you through this battle, I will win this war, I just want praise and worship.<br />when Israel face a battle, they were instructed to do one thing, and one thing only, shout and sing praise and worship unto the Lord.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; In the battle between Gideon and the Midianites, God chose only three hundred men to fight with Gideon, and said, you will fight with these men only, and I will do the rest. God had him put lit candles into pitchers of clay, and at the right time, they broke the pitchers, and the light shone out, and they began to shout and sing praise unto the Lord, and the Lord took it from there.<br />in the time of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, the children of Amon and Moab came up against them. The king, instead of going to his advisors, or Generals, went directly into the House of God, and began to praise Him. (2 Chron. 20:5) that was all. he&nbsp;stood in the Congregatrion,&nbsp;&nbsp;before the Altar, and began to simply remind God, and praise Him, for all that He had done for the Children of Israel, from the time that He brought them out of Egypt, to the present.<br />&nbsp;After he had spent some time in prayer, God answered him. He had to. He had no choice. God told him, hold still, this battle is mine, not yours, I will fight it. When the time came to do battle, God simply said, sing, praise me, I will do the rest, and He did.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Word of God, whenever His people got into trouble, they worshipped Him, they gave Him all that they had in Praise. Whenever God blessed them in a special way, they praised Him.<br /><br />&nbsp; All through history, God has had only one desire for His people: that they praise and worship Him.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; David, known as The Sweet Psalmist of Israel (2 Sam. 23:1) and a man after God's own heart, wrote in Psa. 22:3, ' But thou art&nbsp;Holy, O thou that inhabitest the Praises of Israel...'<br />&nbsp; So, Let me ask you something, if God did all that for His people back then, and many things in the New Testament as well, simply because they worshipped Him, and we are the children of Abraham by faith, do we not have the same promises?&nbsp; Was not the God who delivered Jehoshaphat, Gideon, David, and many others, simply because they praised Him, the same one that told us we are His children and&nbsp;that&nbsp;He would not withhold any good thing from those that ask, as long as it is within His will?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; But I ask you, Where is Gods' Praise? where is His Worship? when are we going to realize that the only way we are going to win any&nbsp;Spiritual battles whatsoever is to get on our knees, or to stand up, and to clap and sing, and praise and worship&nbsp;the God Almightry of the ages.<br /><br /><br /><br /><font size=""6"">' It's time to praise the Lord!!!!!!!'</font>&nbsp;</font></font>"

/><br />The young man was told to speak, to say what he could in his own defence,<br />As he spoke, there emanated from him a power, something that all those present could sense.<br /><br />""oh your Majesties,"" the man began in a humble voice, "" I pray that you will listen to the words I have to say,<br />For they are words, not found in a textbook of higher learning, nor a novel of fictitious work, but in the Bible, the book which points to Jesus as the only true way""<br /><br />""They are words,"" he continued in a voice which had taken on an authoritative tone,<br />""Words that can set you free and lead you on to a heavenly throne.""<br /><br />The King's interest was piqued at the mention of a throne that could be found in a Heavenly place,&nbsp;<br />He looked down at the young man before him, and gestured him to go on, then noticed a Glory he'd never seen before radiate about his face.<br /><br />"" Your Majesty, I have been put in chains for speaking of a truth from the Bible, a truth many had not seen before,<br />One which would give others Joy and Power, a Truth which holds Jesus as friend and companion, not just a distant Lord.<br /><br />Allow me now, your majesty, to show unto you the plan that Jesus was born to bring into being,<br />A plan that can take the common man from the dirt and debris of this world, and give him power to become a Heavenly King.""<br /><br />His Majesty looked down&nbsp;uon the man that was kneeling &nbsp;before him, and felt something he had never before known could be,<br />Some kind of power, so strong and intense, more than anything he had yet seen.<br /><br />For a Presence, or some sort of Spirit had come upon him, and had put within him a desire, a hunger to know more about what this man had to say,<br />causing the King to have him taken to his chambers, where the charges that were laid against him could be more fully explained.<br /><br />Seated across from the Monarch, in the King's own chambers, a cup of water at his side,the young man felt God's power come upon him, putting in his heart the things he should do,<br />his Majesty began by asking for more details of the things he had said, the hunger in his heart growing to learn more of the Truth.<br /><br />He said, "" My son I have heard it said that the things you speak are heresies against the church, and the doctrines that they teach,<br />It's been said that you tell people there is no purgatory, and that there is more to the Bible than what the Bishop will preach.<br /><br />""tell me now,"" the King continued, ""whether it is true or not, so that I should know how to decide in your case,<br />For even now I feel there is something strange about you, as evidenced by the glow I see about your face<br /><br />So come now, let me hear it, keep me in suspense no longer.""<br />Then the man, his face growing bright, began to talk about his God, his voice growing ever stronger.<br /><br />And he said, ""Oh your Majesty, truly I am overjoyed at the chance to tell you of the things that God has done for me,<br />For though on the outside you see irons and chains, yet on the inside, God's Spirit has set me free indeed.<br /><br />The things I would like to tell you of,"" he continued, "" are found in the scriptures, largely in the book of THE ACTS,<br />Words which are more than just a legend of what happened years ago, but are accounts of things people held as true and faithful facts.""<br /><br />""let me take you now to the day known as Pentecost, the day on which God's Spirit upon His people fell,<br />The Spirit which gave them power to live for God, turn from sin, and be saved from hell.""<br /><br />""and SIr"", the man went on, seeing wonder and astonishment register upon the King's face,<br />""that same power wasn't just for them back then, but continues on for all who seek God's grace.""<br /><br />The man looked at him for a moment, as tears streamed down the cheeks of the King,<br />And knew that the Monarch's reactions to his next words would decide what his fate should be.<br /><br />""Your Majesty"" He continued in a voice that was almost a whisper, ""There is recorded in the Bible the story of another man, who was brought before another king to answer for what he taught,<br />This man was the Apostle Paul, and though this other king was troubled, as are you, still he turned not to God.<br /><br />Be not as this other king I pray, let not pride hinder you from the truth, let God show you what real peace can be,<br />Let Him take all that is in your heart and soul, turn to Him tonight, then when all this earth is passed away, you'll see what it is to be a heavenly priest, son of a Heavenly King"".<br /><br />As the man spoke these last words, the king's countenance had changed, his heart had hardened and turned to stone,<br />The change reflected outward, showing pride and jealousy on his face.The gall of this, this peasant, what right did he have to call the king a sinner?how did he dare to speak against the man on the throne?<br /><br />The man saw the change that came over the king, saw the hardness that came over his face,<br />But he knew he had only spoken what God had given him, he knew he hadn't stepped out of place.<br /><br />The king rose from his chair and went to the door to call his gaurds, anger dripping from every word he spoke,<br />""Gaurd,"" he screamed, his face turning red, his voice starting to choke.<br /><br />The king pointed to the man in the chair, as the soldier stepped into the room,<br />He was astonished to see the smile on his face, though the king was certain that the man knew he had sealed his doom.<br /><br />""I want this taken down to the dungeon, and prepared for execution, which will take place in three days, inform the executioner that he is to be ready at dawn on that day"",<br />""and you"", he continued, as he turned toward the young man, "" had better hope that there is some kindness in this God to whom you pray"".<br /><br />The young man looked&nbsp;at the king, as the gaurd hustled him out the door, and spoke to him with a voice full of love,<br />""Yes your Majesty,"" the young man replied, before he was pushed out the door, ""there is kindness in my God, as you will find out, when you receive the Power from above"".<br /><br />The young man was pushed out into the hallway,&nbsp; leaving the king standing there in anger, fury oozing from every pore,<br />Then he was taken to his particular cell in the dungeon, which he was thrown into, while the gaurd slammed shut the heavy steel door.<br /><br />As the clang of metal on metal reverberated throughout the prison, the young man fell on his face and began to pray,<br />""Oh dear God in Heaven"", he cried out, his face to the floor, I beseech you in the name of Jesus, that somehow, through some method, you will reveal to the king that there is only one true way.""<br /><br />The young man sat up, and rubbed his face with his hands, he was getting tired, he felt exhausted, he knew that soon he would have to get some sleep,<br />He had just lain down and drifted into a light slumber, when his eyes popped open, and he beheld the strangest sight he had ever seen.<br /><br />All around him was a light: white, bright, and intense. it seemed to fill every corner of every cell, chasing all the darkness away,<br />It seeped into every nook and cranny, leaving no place for darkness, a light more pure and intense than the day.<br /><br />as the young man got to his knees, to investigate the strange goings on, he noticed a figure, dressed in shining white, with his face all aglow,<br />The figure opened his mouth and began to speak, though the young manfelt rather than heard the words, in a voice which seemed to flow.<br /><br />""My precious son"" the figure began, with words which seemed to peirce his soul and set it aflame,<br />The figure continued, "" do not fear me, for I am sent from The Lord, to tell you that your prayer has been answered this day,<br />and to bring you comfort and hope, do not fear the things that shall befall you, but give God the glory and praise"".<br /><br />Then he figure was gone, darkness again reigned, and the young man found himself lying on the floor,<br />He looked around, and found that he was shaking, tears streamed down his face, as he remarked, ""surely, I have been in the presence of the Lord"".<br /><br />Alone in his chambers, where he paced up and down the floor, the king was feeling no such peace,<br />For ever since he had the young man taken back to the dungeoun, and sentenced to death, he felt an emptiness, something he could not ease.<br /><br />The words the young man had spoken kept returning, keeping him from rest, turning over and over in his mind,<br />The king sat down in his chair, seething with anger: the gall of that man, he raged inside.<br /><br />How could he say I give way to pride, that I do not let God have His way in my heart,<br />For if I did not turn to God with all my problems, this country would be torn apart.<br /><br />And what did he say about Gods' Spirit falling down on Pentecost?<br />How could just receivng God's Spirit keep man from being lost?<br /><br />The king was troubled, he knew there were no easy answers, but he knew he must find them, difficult though they may be,<br />He turned to the gaurd standing by his door, "" send someone to the library,"" he ordered, "" and have them bring a copy of the Holy Writ to me""<br /><br /><br />The young man sat down the bowl of food, which the gaurd had just placed in his hand,<br />He had no desire to eat, his mind already on thoughts of a much better land.<br /><br />His thoughts were interrupted by a sound coming from the cell next to his; he looked over and saw his young friend, Tobias, weeping, with his hand covering his face,<br />Tobias, or Toby, was two years younger, a good friend, whom he had known for several years before they were arrested and sentenced to this place.<br /><br />Toby had withstood persecution, giving praise to God during the beatings and floggings, refusing to give ini even when the priest had stood before him, ordering him to recant,<br />Stood there, silent and meek, when sentenced to imprisonment, until he could see that this cause was not worth dying for, when he would choose freedom over chains, and bands.<br /><br />But he hadn't. for over a year now the two of them had sat there, day after day, talking to each other, encouraging one another in the Lord,<br /><br /></font></font></p></blockquote></blockquote>"

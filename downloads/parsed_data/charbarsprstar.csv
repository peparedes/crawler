"event","It's easy for people to be asked their favorite music/bands and for them to immediately list off whatever bands they think suit their persona, or whatever their current band of the week is. Maybe you really do like those bands, but there are a whole lot more that you aren't telling us about.

There is music lurking on your mp3 player that you know you jam to, sing, dance to when no one is around to hear it and maybe even when they are.

The Shuffle Challenge:
Set your player to shuffle whether it be on your mp3 player or computer and list the first 100 (YES A HUNDRED) songs that come up without skipping any because you might be embarassed or think it's silly.

Why so many? Because it gives a good chance of delving into all the types of music you really enjoy whereas 5-10 would just scratch the surface. If something ridiculous comes on and you feel like you have to explain it, go ahead. We're not judging you. Ready GO!

"event","I finally graduated on June 23rd, and I have a job at Great Clips.  My state board test is on August 5th.  I've been trying to study like crazy...but I usually get distracted.  Its SOOO much to remember.  About 15 chapters full of information that I most likely won't even need to know at my job.  I'll be doing haircuts, haircuts, and some more haircuts.

I'm really excited to start working full time so I can save up money to finally MOVE OUT!  I'm ready for my OWN place.  Not sure if I'll try to find a roommate yet.  The thought of being alone all night kinda freaks me out.  I'm a big wuss in the dark...I don't like to be home alone at night here.  I'm also afraid to live with a friend, because I'm afraid we would drive each other crazy.  Not that I find any of my friends annoying, its just when you live with someone and you're around each other more than you used to be...its different.  Don't want anymore drama.  Most of my friends have already got their own place anyway...so I'll probably be flying solo!  

I won't get my new health insurance for 90 days a great clips, so I've been without for a few weeks now.  I can't afford the Humira shot (Its a couple THOUSAND $$$ for 2 shots) so I have to join a drug study.  I'm a little nervous to join and have a brand new drug tested on me...but ya gotta do whatcha gotta do, right?  Hopefully the meds work as well as the Humira or better.  My Nexium and Mercaptopurine cost about $600 for both of them.  Thank goodness Dad got my last refills for me.  I can't believe they charge that much for a one month supply of meds!  My Crohns hasn't bothered me in awhile, so thats also a blessing.

I was admitted to the hospital for about a week.  They put a picc line in, which is a really big drag.  Now I'm on the TPN again and can't eat.  I went to the dr today, and I have a scope on wednesday morning.  The new opening in my stomach that they made back in August is closed up, so they are going to try and stretch it back out.  The procedure is one that I've had a billion times, but it is scarier this time because there is a change they could cause a perforation from the balloon trying to stretch out my stomach.  Hopefully everything will go alright and it will work, then I can get this fucking line out of my arm and join the ""people who can eat regular food"" club again.

I registered a team to walk for the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America walk next month at Sawyer Point.  A big thanks to everyone who has joined the team!  I'm hoping we raise at least $125 before May 31st.  It feels good to help out an organization that is trying to help me and everyone else struggling with this illness...even my cat.

Refrain: Riu, riu, chiu (nightingale's sounds)
The river bank protects it,
As God kept the wolf
from our lamb.
Refrain: Riu, riu, chiu...

The rabid wolf tried to bite her,
But God Almighty knew how to defend her,
He wished to create her impervious to sin,
Nor was this maid to embody original sin.
Refrain: Riu, riu, chiu...

The newborn child is the mightiest monarch,
Christ patriarchal invested with flesh.
He made himself small and so redeemed us:
He who was infinite became finite.
Refrain: Riu, riu, chiu...

Many prophecies told of his coming,
And now in our days have we seen them fulfilled.
God became man, on earth we behold him,
And see man in heaven because he so willed.

After tomorrow, I will be certified in Microderm Abrasion.  Anyone need to remove the top layer of skin from their face?  I can totally help you out.  I just have to take the test. I'm at 7 1/2 hours, and its 8 hours to get your certification...so another 1/2 hour of test-taking.

Trader's World on sunday was groovy.  I hadn't hung out with Mom and Amanda in awhile, + Corey and Robin showed up!  Eating greasy flea market pizza is not a good idea, your stomach will hate you for it.  These 2 dudes always have cool Monkees (and sometimes Beatles) suprises for me.  

Hope everyone enjoyed election day!  <3
Peace & Love.

"event","Trying on clothes is a HUGE drag.  Nothing ever fits right.  Trying to find a dress for my halloween costume is an even BIGGER drag.  Bleh.  I don't know if I'm going to be able to pull off the Edie costume, because 1. I can't pull an outfit together, and 2. I keep thinking about how much I don't look like her in the weight area, and it makes me feel like shit.  This is my most favorite time of year, and I'm starting to feel like I just don't even want to dress up.  The prices on costumes at the halloween superstores are outrageously high, and poorly made!  What to do, what to do?

If I get one more bitchy client at school, I'm going to explode.

I'm slacking on my knitting.  I keep wanting to work on it, but I feel like poop so I just lay down instead.  I need to take a field trip to the thrift stores to find fabric so I can start working on Christmas gifts.  Hopefully I can get some things done this week when my head clears up.

"event","We had no power for nearly 24 hours at my house.  My sister and I played Disney Monopoly for quite some time, and she kicked my ass at it and took all my money everytime.  Boo on her!  Before going to bed, Mom, Amanda, and I played flashlight tag, and then Mom and Amanda played Burglars and pretended to rob out kitchen.  We are a fun times family, lemme tell ya.  Our power came back on today, and Amanda, Granny, and I wanted to go get a sandwich somewhere.  Every restaurant in our part of town was closed, so we went down by Forest Park to McDonalds.  EVERYONE in the area was there, and the staff looked so frazzled, I felt sorry for them.  Well, I ordered a chicken sandwich, got a completely different sandwich, went up to have it fixed, and they forgot about it.  I asked for my money back, and the manager gave me a coupon for a free value meal, the correct sandwich, and my money back!  Yay for McDonalds under pressure.  I didn't have to work today because the daycare has no power, and that kinda pissed me off, because today was my first full day going back from 9-6, and I need to get paid!  Hopefully the power is on out at school so I can go tomorrow.  I hope everyone who still doesn't have power gets it back soon, and I also hope nobody was hurt in the storm yesterday with all of the trees/ power lines that went down.  <3"

"event","I've calmed down a bit since my last post...but only a bit.  I still feel like I'm distanced from some of the people I used to be close to.  I've been stuck in a depression since my surgery, possibly since before that, and I'm trying my best to get out of it.  I enjoy being optomistic and cheerful, and I try to think about all that I have to be thankful for and that cheers me up, but being at home so much left with nothing but your thoughts can really bum you out!  I know people grow apart as years go by, and I guess thats just something that you have to accept when it happens.  Going to the ER last night didn't help my bummer-mood either, and I'm going to go insane being at the hospital so much.  Everyone that is healthy and doesn't have any chronic or major health complications...BE THANKFUL.

I go back to my normal schedule next week, so maybe that will get me out of this funk.  I enjoy living by my own ""peace and love"" theory, no matter what anyone thinks or says, so I need to remember that!

"event","I am not a confrontational person.  I don't like fighting, tension, or hatrid.  I usually try to get along with everyone and when someone is mean/starts shit/is aggravating, I let it slide and forgive way too easily.  Lately, it seems like I should start being a little bit more bitchy when it comes to people.  If someone is a complete douchebag/rude ass/dumb fuck, then I really don't want to be around them.  I just get quiet and aggravated and wait to leave.  I don't think that you shouldn't be friends with someone just because you have different views on things than they do, and I have a lot of friends that do things I'm not into, and I do things they aren't really psyched about.  I just feel like I need to draw a line at what to tolerate and what not to.  I don't want to be judgemental or seem like a snobby bitch, but I'd rather sit at home alone then hang out somewhere and feel really out of place and just be pissed off.  I don't want any of my friends who read this to think that I'm bitching about them personally, its a mix of different people that I just don't want to be around.

The reason I'm so quiet around a lot of peole is because I'm shy as fuck.  If I don't know you, then I probably won't start yackin' a mile a minute to you right off the bat unless I am intoxicated.  I keep to myself.  Mainly, because I get WAY TOO self-concious and think that anything that I say around someone I don't know is going to sound retarded, and they are going to think I'm a dumbass.  I have to warm up to people before I can have real conversations with them most of the time.  I'm working on trying to be more talkative to new people so that I don't come off as a snob mcgee, but it takes time and it isn't easy for me to open up so quickly.  I want to meet new people and make new friends, so I'm trying my damndest to be personable and friendly.

Have I bitched enough?  Probably.

I don't seem to understand people much anymore."

I wanted to try and hit up Kings Island before surgery so I could ride some rides, but I don't think I planned ahead well enough for that one. If you go after 5 p.m., its only $15! 

Robin taught me how to knit, and it is super rad.  I'm excited to learn how to make groovy crafts like she does.  Stitch n' Bitch parties are the best.  Also, Apples to Apples nights at Pearl's are the best x2.  ""Touchy Feely..at my parents house...""  Oh, Renasty!

The surgery isn't as serious as I was once lead to believe.  They're going to do a bypass, and connect my stomach to my colon to bypass the duodenum where the strictures are.  Only a few days in the hospital, about a month of recovery if all goes well.

The red is what they are bypassing.  The purple is what they are connecting (not the large intestine, the small underneath of it.)

I don't know how soon the surgeon will want to do the surgery, but hopefully it can wait awhile...I've gone this long with my messed up bowels, it can go another few weeks.  My first surgery was put off for nearly 6 months (I was in 7th grade, and they waited until summer break so I didn't miss any school), so 2 weeks is nothin'!  Plus, I'm super scared for this surgery...so I'm in no rush..."

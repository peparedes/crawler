"event","I am going to start blogging every time I have a run in with my ex husband.&nbsp; This way I have something to show as proof of what happened during either the phone conversation or the visit.&nbsp; Here's the first of it.

About 45 minutes ago, Donald called and talked to the kids.&nbsp; While he was talking to Alexis, the other line beeped and Alexis handed the phone over to me.&nbsp; I put it up to my ear to tell Donald to hold on for just a minute so that I could tell my friend that I would call her back since he was talking to the kids.&nbsp; When I did this I heard his girlfriend, Jana, in the background saying &quot;I would just hang up on the b***h&quot;.&nbsp; I just hit the button to switch lines and told my friend that I would call her back and switched lines again back to Donald.&nbsp; Again, Jana was talking in the background cussing me and calling me names.&nbsp; I handed the phone back to Alexis hoping that she would stop.&nbsp; 

After he talked to Kenzie and Jaison, Kenzie handed me the phone saying that Donald wanted to talk to me.&nbsp; He started off by asking if everything was going ok with the kids and I said yes everything was fine.&nbsp; Then he asked me if I have received anything from the IRS&nbsp;stating that I was &quot;in big trouble for f*****g up on my taxes and claiming the kids&quot;.&nbsp; (Verbatim word for word)&nbsp; I told him that I had not gotten anything from the IRS&nbsp;but was sure that I would soon since I filed an amendment with the IRS.&nbsp; He then just started talking about the divorce decree and how I still owed him half of my tax return from 2007 taxes, on which I claimed the kids because he signed the necessary documents for me to do so.&nbsp; I stayed calm and only said &quot;mmhmm&quot; and &quot;uhhuh&quot; to his rantings.&nbsp; He then proceeded to tell me that he was taking me back to court to get full custody of the kids.&nbsp; His words were &quot;Oh, and I'm not just taking you to court to make you pay for all of this mess, but also, I want my kids back.&quot;&nbsp; Again his girlfriend was in the background cussing me and saying &quot;Yeah, b***h, then you'll have to pay US child support.&quot;&nbsp; He then he said goodnight and hung up.&nbsp;"

"event","With my friend posting an entry after so long, I've decided that I should post something of an update on my life as well.&nbsp; 

If you'll notice the change in my biography section, I have changed both my job and my major.&nbsp; I now work at White Bluff Resort on Lake Whitney as a front desk clerk at The Inn.&nbsp; It is a very different setting from the one at Holiday Inn but still in the hospitality industry.&nbsp; I love it!! A resort is so much different yet still the same as a hotel chain.&nbsp; We have much more to deal with in the way of marketing, groups, and venues, but it makes the job much more interesting!&nbsp; 

As for my college career, I have decided to go the route of Business Administration in hopes that I will learn a little bit more about the business side of the hospitality industry. At least that's what my student coordinator told me would help.&nbsp; I sure hope so :S&nbsp; The minor in Accounting is one that will hopefully help me understand the postings made to the different guest and group accounts we have to deal with on a regular basis.&nbsp; It's turned out ok so far, but this is also the first term that I have had any type of mathematics class to learn online.&nbsp; So wish me luck! :)

As for the rest of my life - my kids are getting too big, too fast right in front of my face.&nbsp; Alexis will be 11 this year, Kenzie will be 9 and Jaison will be 8.&nbsp; They drive me crazy on a regular basis and I wouldn't have it any other way.&nbsp; I have so many stories to tell about them it would fill a book the size of &quot;War &amp; Peace&quot;.&nbsp; They are my life and I love them so much.

As for my relationship - It's still going strong with the natural bumps along the way.&nbsp; Of course this is only the second major relationship in my life so I think that dating for 3 years is a really good thing.&nbsp; We have no plans on marriage just yet, but it's a possibility.&nbsp; He really is a great man in my eyes.&nbsp; Not so much in a few of my relatives and friend's eyes, but they bear with me and believe me when I say I am truly happy with my man.&nbsp; He treats me so much better than the last one ever did.&nbsp; He is always home when I need him to be and is doing his best to make me the happiest woman in the world.&nbsp; He loves my children as if they were his own although we have the 'good cop/bad cop' discussion quite often.&nbsp; They look up to him and love him for the stability and compassion he has shown them the last three years.&nbsp; He really has done his best to take on a family of 4 coming from being in a family of himself and 2 others.&nbsp; 

As for the ex - well, there's a reason he's the ex.&nbsp; Here lately, I have had some major trials with issues dealing with this man.&nbsp; Mind you I was not raised to hate anyone.&nbsp; It's bad for your body, mind, and spirit.&nbsp; It will eat you alive from the inside out.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this man, this single man, has made me go against everything I know.&nbsp; He has tried me and tried me and pushed enough buttons to make a preacher start drinking.&nbsp; I can honestly say that I hate the man now.&nbsp; He is not the man I married nor fell in love with over ten years ago.&nbsp; He is not the man that I was married to when our children were born.&nbsp; In my opinion, he is evil and vindictive.&nbsp; He is not the father that I envisioned him being when I first became pregnant with our first child.&nbsp; He is far from it.&nbsp; He does not see his children like he should, but I suppose that him living over 4 hours away has something to do with that. But even at that he has a phone, yet he will not call to talk to the children, but more often than not he calls to harrass me and try to make my life hell on earth.&nbsp; I honestly can say that I would not feel an ounce of remorse if he just up and disappeared tomorrow.&nbsp; Well, I would feel bad for my children because they are too young to understand exactly what kind of man he truly is.&nbsp; I can't stand that I feel this way and nothing I have tried has been able to release me of this hate.&nbsp; Everytime I think that I have calmed down and let go of that evil feeling, he calls and the second I hear his voice it's back again.&nbsp; I pray to God every night that he will help me gain the strength and willpower to be able to let this go completely and stay calm when dealing with him, but apparently right now I am not supposed to I guess, because the feeling returns each time the phone rings and his number shows up on my caller id.&nbsp; Please pray for me and help me get through this rough time as I need all the support I can get.&nbsp; 

Ok! Well now that I have updated everyone (well just April &amp; LaVerne lol), I feel a little bit better!!&nbsp; I will do my best to keep up with this blog and hopefully it will help me get through all my tough times.&nbsp; Hope this blog finds everyone well and you are in my thoughts and prayers on a daily basis.&nbsp;

"event","Ok. Got my books in today for this term of online classes for my Bachelors in Paralegal Science. I'm still wondering why I have to take Statistics, but I'll lump it. Just scared. Last time I took a math class was back when I was going to Hill for my Associates. All these funny symbols scare me. Aaaand I have no clue as to how I'm going to ""show my work"" in a word document. Any pointers????? And what's that funny 'E' symbol thing again? I got in over my head huh? Qualitative, Quantitative....what the heck do they have to do with the law profession???? *grrr* Ok. I will be ok. I had to vent to someone who understands me and won't get aggravated with my ""rantinginonebreathandnotunderstandingawordIsay"" mood. 

Remember that April? We used to talk like that and actually understand each other. Oh, in case you don't know, LaVerne is now in Pittsburgh, or somewhere close to it. Still not quite sure where your actually at. But she might need someone close to her for support. I'm still in TEXAS for pete's sake. Do I need to move up there too???? Maybe I'll find the perfect soul mate up there. I'll stop on that one right now. That's for another blog and things are actually going fairly well right now...I think. But then again just when I think that, things seem to go down hill. *sheesh* Ok. I'm done. Advice anyone, please? (on the school thing at least...lol) My love to you both and all the kids. HIIIII DOODLE!!! My little ones say hi to him as well and want to meet him. That might be a good spring break trip...hmmm...i'll contemplate on that one and get back to ya. *huggles*"

I am going through some changes in my life right now and being able to get it out on here is going to make me feel better. Anyhoo, I will do my best to keep this going on a regular basis. And thanks April for showing me this. You don't know how much it means to me to have you back in my life. Now hopefully I will be able to find myself with your help..lol. Talk to ya'll later!"

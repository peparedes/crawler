Oregon Shakespeare Festival.
So much fun.
We pretty much just wander the streets and shop
And watch plays that have nothing to do with Shakespeare.
Last night we watched The Diary of Anne Frank.
So sad.

So I guess I have to clean it and actually do all my laundry now.  Yuck.  Oh well, I guess it's good I have to do it.  Plus, it's nice to help people out.  They're really appreciative of everything, not to mention quiet and not too much of a hassle at all.  They get us food and movies.  Although I do hate giving up my couch, giant tv, and video games :( oh and my privacy because I no longer have the whole house to myself.

I REALLY hope I get this job at Blockbuster.  It would make my life and really help out my family a lot.

Totally busy yesturday.  Logan came over after work on his motorcycle.  Called up JJ, got ready, went to Dairy Queen for free sundaes.  PEANUT BUTTER SUNDAES ARE SUPERB.  Hung out at my house a few minutes.  Logan put on his leather chaps/gloves/jacket/helmet and got ready to ride away.  He dropped his keys and I hid them.  I finally gave them back.
    He tried to slapbox me.  I jerked away and hit my head on the wall.  Then, he took my hand and tried to punch JJ.  I sprained my thumb.  All that crap they say about not tucking your thumb in your fist is actually true.

Went to JJ's.  We played a lot of Star Wars III on Xbox.  Even if it is totally easy.  Planned a dance party after Chapppy's poker party next Tuesday.  D/l music for it.  Watched soccer.  Talked about taking breakdancing lessons in January because they're super cheap.  Drove home in the Miata.  Some kids flipped us off.  Yeah, they weren't cool, fucking dropouts.  So I made JJ drive up close while I threw pizza onto their car.  MAN WAS I COOL THOUGH BOY HOWDY.

Slept.  Yay.  Ross called.

Dillon came and woke me up.  I was pissed, he was throwing my scrunchies EVERYWHERE I JUST FUCKING CLEANED GOD.  It was Kelby's birthday, so we went to see Land of the Dead.  Of course, I didn't think about bringing ID because I just woke up.  So I just bought a ticket for one movie and went into anyway.  It worked well.

<b>Did anyone else notice Luigi and Goomba from the Super Mario Bros. movie was in Land of the Dead?  And a bombomb-like object?  FUCKING AWESOME MAN</b>

Went to Denny's.  Ate.  It was delicious.  Crazy glued stuff to the table.  I didn't, but it was sure funny to watch.  Drove home.  Some guy was being an asshole, so we drove erratically (but not dangerously, check yo'self).  I laguhed SO HARD.

We also thoroughly discussed the ability to insert the word 'blast' into any sentence.  Try it.  It seriously works.

DAVID.  I feel like such an asshole.  I'm so sorry.  I feel really really bad.  I was so looking forwardto hanging out.  I didn't have my phone all day yesturday.  It was charging@ my mom's office all day.  Forgive me please?  We'll hang out soon, I don't care if it's on some random day.

Ross doesn't have to work today.  I gotta go get ready.  We're totally hanging out and being awesome.  CAN'T WAIT :X:X:X:<3"

So he's working at McDonalds now (yeah I know how weird is that?) so while I made a copy of my cd for him (the one I made ages ago), we went down there to see when he was working.  We saw Chelsea I was happy because I miss that girl, she's a riotttttttttttt.  And then some crazy guy was in front of us and he tried to pay for things with 50 cents and she was all uhhhhhhh....MANAGERRRR??? I laughed you had to have been there.  We got fries and cheeseburgers and Brian has to work Tuesday-Thursday.  crazy.

Yeah so we went back to my house.  Finished his cd.  Colored on it a bit, as it's what I do with all my cds.  He invited me to a movie, his treat.  So I'm all hellz yeah.  Courtney was supposed to go, but she randomly didn't for some reason.  His mom did, though, so that was um....awkward?  Mostly because she made me sit in the front seat.

Went and saw War of the Worlds.  HOLY SHIT IT WAS AWESOME.  I swear I was literally on the edge of my seat the entire time and the noise that the aliens make scares the shit out of me.  We played some DDR, too.  I rocked at it and a whole bunch of people were watchin me smoke that shit.

My tan turned into a burn and it hurts.

So Brian dropped me off at my house, and Ross was there.  I was confused.  So I was like hey sup.  N8 was in the back, and one of his out-of-town friends was in shot.  He went to get the rest of the Piccolo Petes so they could blow more stuff up.  I said ok sw8 have fun and went toward my house.  But he turned off the car and got out to give me a proper goodbye.

Yeah so he left the keys in the car.  The new kid stole the car (it took him a while to figure out how to start it).  Drove to the Baptist church across the block.  Chinese fire drill.  N8 drove around the block and pulled up to my house blaring Motley Crue.  New kid headbanged so hard and I spinkicked.  But I had my Louis Vuitton bad around my shoulder and I lost my balance and fell and for once, I was embarassed.  Yeah anyway Ross went away.

I was supposed to hang out with Laura yesturday, but my mom said I couldn't be out in the sun anymore because I'd get cancer and die.  So Laura: I'm sorry.

<P>They ignored me and were straight up rude to me.&nbsp; I dealt.</P>
<P>We slep on the trampoline with the tv and we watched Mrs. Doubtfire.&nbsp; Yeah, I didn't pick it out, and yeah, I hated watching it for the second time in just a few days.&nbsp; But no, they decided to not let me help choose what we watched.</P>
<P>When I woke up, the other two girls had left.&nbsp; It was like 9, and the sun was blaring in my face.&nbsp; Ate some breakfast, read some magz, watched some tv and In Good Company.&nbsp; FINALLY went home.&nbsp; Meagan came along and we watched America's Next Top Model for a long time.&nbsp; I'm seriously obsessed with that show but one girl on there cries about everything and it's really annoying.</P>
<P>I ditched Meagan to go to Neat Repeat with Nick.&nbsp; He got a pink shirt and I got a few keychains and Devin's old boy scout shirt.&nbsp; It's really cute on me.&nbsp; Went to grandma's.&nbsp; Played video games.&nbsp; Heather and Matt came over.&nbsp; They all hung out and it was awkward for me.&nbsp; So I slept.&nbsp; Now I'm home and happy.</P>
<P>I can't wait to see Ross tomorrow.&nbsp; Seriously, I forgot how much I hate everyone.&nbsp; You all annoy the piss out of me.</P>
<P>Alannis Morrisette is on tv and I really hate it, yet I'm not changing the channel.&nbsp; I can't figure it out, but oh well.</P>
<P>Courtney sent me an im today saying ""call me. we need to talk.""&nbsp; FUCK YOU.&nbsp; Don't get pissy because I made Warped plans without you.&nbsp; You don't even listen to that kind of music, and you haven't kept in contact with me at all.&nbsp; Don't try and be my friend when you're not.&nbsp; Plus, you can just as easily call me, so stop being a lazy faggot and just go away, forever, because you're a pretty lousy friend to me.</P>

<P>Logan called last night.&nbsp; A few people were over at Johnny Mountz's.&nbsp; So, after Ross left, I went over there.&nbsp; Watched a little Blues Brothers.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; Found out that these guys have been planning all sorts of parties and not inviting me.&nbsp; Nobody even told me about Sean's birthday party.&nbsp; I was really pissed off.&nbsp; I still am.&nbsp; <STRONG>This is why I hate everybody.</STRONG></P>
<P>Courtney asked if I wanted to go to Micah's.&nbsp; I hadn't seen him in a long time, and we used to have so much fun there, so I said ok.&nbsp; She said we would only be there for a few minutes.&nbsp; When we got there, there were a bunch of girls like Jessica Patterson and her friends.&nbsp; Onion Tits was there, I was excited.&nbsp; Watched some boxing.&nbsp; Tim is a pussy faggot.&nbsp; Dilly Bars for everyone and taunting Micah's stupid girlfriend was awesome.</P>
<P>But then everyone started ditching me, as usual.&nbsp; It blew.&nbsp; I laid in the grass by myself for a long time.&nbsp; I wanted to just get the hell out of there.</P>
<P>So we finally did.&nbsp; After an hour and a half.&nbsp; Ugh.</P>
<P>Went back to Mountzy's.&nbsp; Hung out.&nbsp; Cracked jokes.&nbsp; People think I'm funny but I'm really not. Brian asked if I wanted to be in his horror flick.&nbsp; I agreed.&nbsp; I have a passionate love scene with Corde and that is awkward.&nbsp; But I get to die and that rules.&nbsp; He is working@ McDonalds and that is too funny.</P>
<P>Logan stayed there and slept, but Chapppy and Johnny and Brian and I went to The Ped.&nbsp; I almost got Apples and Cheese, I was sure craving it, but I got a root beer float instead.&nbsp; Talked about the movie.&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; Lovin' up on Ginger.&nbsp; It was an alright time.</P>

Might be getting a job at a dry cleaners?  I'd only have to work 2-4 hours a day, and that is <i>perfect</i>.  Hopefully the face that I'm 17 and have no experience doesn't matter.

Hung out with Ross.  and stuff.  uh....teehee?  He invited me to dinner.  With his parents and aunt and uncle and cousins.  His cousins didn't go, though.  His aunt and his mom are so much alike and they're so cute ahahahh.  The three of us were all under 5'3 and it was awesome.  Kayo's Roadhouse is delicious and I like being forced to throw my food on the floor.  I saw Mandy there and Jayme J.'s family.  Um, yeah, and we were in Redmond?  K, odd.  Holy shit it was the best food ever.

My / button doesn't work unless I practically punch it.

I'm a bad friend, and I don't care.  How horrible is that, I mean seriously.  I just stopped caring about everyone else.  It doesn't bother me in the least, because they don't seem to care about me, and that's the way it's always been.

How can I be so happy, but so utterly miserable?

And I don't think I'm going to the Warped Tour with Courtney.  Ok, have fun hanging out with Amanda.  Like everyone else does, because she's apparently way cooler than me :|

It's raining and freezing and cloudy outside.  IT'S THE GODDAMNED SUMMER WHAT THE FUCK.  Seriously, even though it's the northwest, this is bullshit.

I watched TCM last night as I slept and had dreams that were awesome.

Time for foods and cleaning, because the bf is coming over later."

<P>Enough about jobs.&nbsp; I'm drinking a huge delicious horchata from 7-11 and it is the spice of life.</P>
<P>So funny story.&nbsp; Meagan spent the night after recital on Saturday because she had to work in the morning and driving to Paulina @ 11pm = gay.&nbsp; Courtney and Marquat and Chapppy came over.&nbsp; We went to 7-11 for horchatas and then we locked bathrooms.&nbsp; Logan H. (who shaved his head, ew) was supposed to do it, but he got something bad in his eye and had to go to the hospital.&nbsp; I went in full Cats makeup and costume it was silly.&nbsp; And then @ 7-11 we saw Biggie and his friend, Brian.&nbsp; teehee.&nbsp; Well the three of them left Meagan and I and we went to sleep @ like midnight.&nbsp; So I'm sleepin', and around 12:30 I'm guessing I hear this clatter on the glass endtable right next to the fold-out bed (couch) so I'm like wtf.&nbsp; I take everything off because I think it's going to break or something and then I go back to bed.&nbsp; I keep hearing it and it starts scaring me SLIGHTLY because I don't know wtf it is.&nbsp; And then like at 1:30, my shoe falls between Meagan and I.&nbsp; I knew someone was in my house by my door because that's where my shoe was.&nbsp; So I turn on the lights and there's Dillon, that faggot.&nbsp; Meagan put her arm down and Jessie, who was hiding under the hide-a-bed, grabbed her arm.&nbsp; She screamed and it was the funniest thing ever.</P>
<P>We all partied until 6 in the morning except Meagan, who went in my room.&nbsp; The three of us crashed on my couch watch my Aqua Teen Hunger Force dvds for a few hours, and then the boys left.&nbsp; But not before another trip to 7-11, lots of Super Mario Bros./Super Mario Bros. 3/Ninja Gaiden, and a plot to drive an hour to Bend to get some pizza.</P>
<P>Oh yeah.&nbsp; My mom and I went to the grocery store yesturday and I bought microwave pork rinds (it's like a bag of popcorn, but with pork rinds WTF) AND...</P>
<P>&lt;marquee&gt;&nbsp;RAP SNACKS!!!!!&lt;/marquee&gt;.&nbsp; I'm posting a picture of them soon, because it's too hillarious to not share with the world.</P>
<P>Then I went to Ross'.&nbsp; We watched Nascar and The 6th Man and then came to my house to watch Dickie Roberst and Anger Management.&nbsp; Kinda....&nbsp; lool.</P>

Yeah, I just found out from the boys in mech how much his roses probably cost.  OH MAN that's far too much for him to spend on moi!  Seriously I love him he's so fantastic and wonderful.  Even the boys in mech say he's finally worthy of me after that, hahah.

I'm getting so good in that class.  I'm so good @ suspension systems, yup.

Kelby came over.  We gossiped about Verity and looked through the yearbook.  Then Ross left.  Kelby talked to Courtney on the im and then we wrote my Americana song.  It had to be about nature so we wrote it about tree love.  It's not bad.

I am still really stuck on my calculus test.  UGH I might just copy it from like Chapppy or something.  Mr. Sime doesn't care so it's all gravy.  And once I see how to do it, I'll understand it.

Anywho.  Time to eat my Chocolate Lucky Charms"

"event","So do any of you drama nerds know of any fantastic <i>funny</i> plays we could do next year?  We're getting a new drama director, and Bruce wants to know what plays we all want to do so he can tell the new director (whoever it may be) our ideas.  So yeah.  If you could tell me some plays, that would rule a lot.  OH.  How do you all think Bat Boy: The Musical would go?  I REALLY want to do it, but living in such a....Christian town, I'm not sure if the old people who watch our plays would approve.

Anyway.

VALIENT THOR IS AWESOME.  SHIT CHECK THIS OUT: http://www.valientthorr.com/audio/Valient%20Thorr%20-%20Gauntlet.mp3

Yeah, I'm home sick today.  I actually just didn't want to perform my Americana song because I don't have a voice+ I'm sick.  And I wanted to try and finish up my calculus test (if anybody can help me with this crap, PUHLEASE im me.  I'm pretty awesome at math, but I missed so much school I have no idea what I'm doing).

The cops came by this morning and told me to move my car.  Like now.  I was like wtf I'm sick go away.

I love watching The OC when I'm home it makes me feel soooooo happy :)

This is like, the longest week ever already.

I'm going to go watch Spanglish and do my calculus k? k.

Oh, and if you ever call me, don't just hang up on me, especially if I don't know who the hell you are hokkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkay?"

"event","<P>What is amiss?&nbsp; The play is finally over.&nbsp; I'm relieved, but sad at the same time.&nbsp; This was the last play for a lot of my friends.&nbsp; The last time we'll ever get to hang out.&nbsp; The last time I'll probably ever get to play kissing rugby with them, which has become a staple for every cast party.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; Depressing.&nbsp; I hate growing up.</P>
<P>A few memorable moments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>what is amiss, DUDE? (insert Dyllon pelvic thrusting the air here)</LI>
<LI>""DO ME""</LI>
<LI>naked hugs</LI>
<LI>the burning sensation as I put my nose on.</LI>
<LI>breaking AND dislocating my toe, and then having to pop it back in backstage without making any noise because we were performing.</LI>
<LI>Choking on asprin water.</LI>
<LI>4 calculus students trying to help a first grader with her math, and failing.</LI>
<LI>By the way, 1x5=1 and 0-5=0</LI>
<LI>Hanging out with KJ and having her tell us all the grade school gossip.</LI>
<LI>KJ being a thespian as a first grader.</LI>
<LI>Finally being a thespian HELLO AWESOME!</LI>
<LI>Catching Macbeth and Ross kissing.&nbsp; teehee scandalous.</LI>
<LI>Rachel and Courtney kissing wtf RANDOM</LI>
<LI>JIGGLYPOOF!</LI>
<LI>Catching a cold.</LI>
<LI>Hanging out on 'the island'.</LI>
<LI>Hiding behind the random fake tree in the auditorium.</LI>
<LI>""THE PHANTOM"" AHHAH</LI>
<LI>Hammering my butt.</LI>
<LI>Super Mario 3 and burritos</LI>
<LI>Leather chaps.</LI>
<LI>Singing dancing queen while getting windmilled.</LI>
<LI>Wearing all the fake scars ahahah so much fun.</LI>
<LI>The 80's dance the other day!&nbsp; SO MUCH FUN and hanging out with all the (2) scene kids.</LI>
<LI><EM>Sword fighting to the Backstreet Boys</EM></LI>
<LI>Playing the Backstreet Boys as the audience entered.</LI>
<LI>Corde finally dying on the last day it ruled so much.</LI></UL>
<P>etc etc.&nbsp; Good times for all.&nbsp; Bummed still about not getting to go to the banquet.&nbsp; But whatevs.</P>
<P>Marcus B. called me the other day.&nbsp; I talked to him for a good 45 minutes.&nbsp; He's coming into town this weekend for graduation and we're SO hanging out.&nbsp; BUDDY CALLED ME TOO!&nbsp; His band (no idea whether they're good or not) is playing the day after the Warped Tour, so I'm going to hang out with him for a bit.&nbsp; Excited much?&nbsp; YES.</P>
<P>Yesturday I woke up and helped put new windows into my house.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had rain and wood and metal shaving all over my computer and I was NOT very happy.&nbsp; But then we went to Brother's and I ate A LOT and was very happy because it was delicious.&nbsp; And then I came home and called Ross and he told me he was coming over.&nbsp; And guess what?</P>
<P><STRONG>He brought me 2 dozen roses, yup!</STRONG></P>
<P>I totally didn't deserve them.&nbsp; Man I love him soososoo much he treats me far better than I ever deserve.&nbsp; Anyway, I was so excited and then we watched National Treasure which was actually really good!&nbsp; He let me borrow Spanglish which I have yet to watch.&nbsp; Hopefully he can hang out with me after dance this afternoon (which, note to self,&nbsp;is now 3:30-4:30 on account of senior awards crap) and we can watch it 2geths.</P>
<P>Tomorrow is my 2 month!&nbsp; 2 WHOLE MONTHS WHODA THUNK?</P>
<P>I seriously have to go start my calculus test due today and shower and write my song like NOW</P>"

"event","<P>Apparently Ross came over to visit me Monday, but I was in Paulina.&nbsp; So he talked to my dad.&nbsp; For like 2 hours.&nbsp; And enjoyed it.&nbsp; This is why he rules.&nbsp; And we got our prom pictures back \m/ man they are good.&nbsp; Except my neck looks all strained because I started laughing @ Onion Tits talking about bj's or something.</P>
<P>I am really starting to hate the rain.&nbsp; I mean come on it's June now time for some sun!</P>
<P>Happy birthday N8 you're finally an old man (17).</P>
<P>I'm really starting to stress a little.&nbsp; All this play stuff is really agitating me.&nbsp; + I have to do a workbook that I can't even find and write a paper that I can't print out because my printer died a little.&nbsp; I also have to write a song that I keep forgetting about and I have to perform it next time I go to class.&nbsp; Therefore, I have to skip class and I hate it.&nbsp; And today I have to go watch a senior presentation and I like, don't want to.</P>
<P>I'm never going to find a job.&nbsp; Because every time I go pick up an application, the place hires like 92834892 people and I hate it.&nbsp; I'm never going to get a job and I'm going to be poor forever.</P>
<P>I h8 school and I can't wait until it's over.&nbsp; Especially because we have a 4-day weekend, and I don't get to enjoy ANY OF IT AT ALL.</P>
<P><b><u>UPDATE:</u></b> I remember what I was going to write about that was totally awesome.  Missy Ashley beat the shit out of Sydney Currier.  And then later on, Vanessa Roberts beat the shit out of her.  Her nose was out of whack (they had to pop in back in, ahahha) and her lip was split open, etc etc.  That totally made my day.  She is such a cunt I'm not even kidding.  I'm glad the legacy I started with kicking the crap out of her has lived on.</P>

"event","<P>Wow.&nbsp; It's been two whole years since you've been gone.&nbsp; It seems like just yesturday it all happened.&nbsp; Those few seconds that would change my life forever.&nbsp; I hate thinking about it.&nbsp; I try my hardest to just erase it from my memory.&nbsp; It seems like the harder I try, the harder all my memories of you imprint themselves into my head.&nbsp; Sometimes I think about you and smile.&nbsp; Other times, the pain is almsot unbearable.&nbsp; I miss you <U>so much.</U>&nbsp; Why did this all have to happen?&nbsp; Maybe to make us appreciate every waking moment more and more?&nbsp; If that was the point, then trust me, it worked.&nbsp; I don't think there's anything harder than losing someone you love, someone who you've been through thick and thin through.&nbsp; Especially when that person was your first love.&nbsp; I always thought we'd grow up and get married.&nbsp; At the least, we'd be friends until we grew old, and then we'd play Bingo together.&nbsp; Now looking ahead and knowing that none of it will come true makes me feel like someone knocked the wind out of me.</P>
<P>This all really sucks.&nbsp; For all of you who don't know what I'm talking about, on this day 2 years ago, I watched my best friend/boyfriend die in a horrendous car accident.&nbsp; It makes me physically nauseous just recalling everything that happened that fateful night.&nbsp; It should have been me in that seat.&nbsp; It should have been me dead.&nbsp; We switched seats because I hated sitting in the middle.&nbsp; I know it's not, but to this day, I still feel like it's my fault.&nbsp; It kills me inside.</P>
<P>I meant to write all of this yesturday, but I ended up going to Paulina and staying @ Meagan's last night.&nbsp; I had that same dream though.&nbsp; The dream where Spike apparently died in a house fire.&nbsp; And then I sat on the steps of Crooked River Grade School crying and he walks up to me and kisses me on the cheek.&nbsp; He tells me not to worry about him, that he's fine and that's he's here for me.&nbsp; He gives me a huge hug.&nbsp; I can feel everything.&nbsp; I cry and ask why he did this, why he made everyone so sad.&nbsp; He just tells me to be quiet.&nbsp; He takes my hand and we walk across the playground.</P>
<P>I woke up, realized it was all a dream, and started sobbing again.&nbsp; I could still feel his kiss hot on my cheek.&nbsp; I was almost in hysterics.&nbsp; Why do you have to tease me like so?&nbsp; I love seeing you again, knowing you're always there.&nbsp; But knowing you're not physically there for me to talk to sucks.&nbsp; God I'm starting to sound like a cornball.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; It's been so hard for me to come to terms with his death.&nbsp; I think I took the hardest of anyone.&nbsp; I think I'm the only one who still cries over him.&nbsp; How does everyone else get over death easier than I?&nbsp; More than anything in the entire world, <EM>I just want him to come back.</EM></P>
<P>Please.&nbsp; Promise me you all will never drink and drive.&nbsp; I swear to God I will come hunt you down and cut you so hard if you ever hurt yourselves.</P>"

<P><FONT color=#ffccff>Sian la... like too early for fyp grouping, but some of my frds form liao n even ask tutor liao! N the sub-dean talked to us, group B students, coz our PA will be in Yr 3 sem 1, leaving us not much time for fyp den. Thus we may have to start earlier. Of coz not to the extent that he ask us 2 form groups now, but i guess what he said will wake us up n realise that time would pass very fast... </FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#ffff66>1. Driving. Tink it's quite essential, but certainly not really now as i dun haf a car at home... But if i know now its definitely better... Nice to have a driving license in my wallet as well...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffff66>2. Play the piano. My mum told me that when i was young, she asked mi if i wanted to learn playing the piano and i replied no... But that was when i was young, how would i know whats a piano? But anyway even if i learnt when i was young, i would most prob forget it now as there would no space for a piano in my home anyway. Now i would learn to play it simply out of passion, but piano lessons are exp... so maybe when i start working ba... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffff66>3. To sing. My singing really sucks, maybe its at 20% now, maybe singing lessons will bring it up to 70%, which may be good enough for mi... I juz want to sound better singing in ktvs only... haa...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffff66>4. To play the guitar better. I know a bit of strumming but i know there is much room for improvement. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffff66>So many things to learn, and when i start working there wun be enough time for ALL that. But not when i m retiring too... But i guess i will find time in the future... hopefully... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffff66>I have time now but no money... muz it always be such a trade-off? I would rather have both at the same time... Study hard now, earn money in the future, den no time to learn what i wan to learn? Hmmm... haha... </FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#99ff99>Hall FOC is over! But i dun have as much fun as during NBS FOC. The feeling of a freshie and a senior is indeed different...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#99ff99>1. I clicked better and know the 25 or so freshies in my NBS group more than the 10 or so freshies in my hall group. Less people, more bonding...? Maybe so for the freshies, but not for the seniors. Moreover our group has too many seniors attached...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#99ff99>2. Unhappiness and a misunderstanding during my hall FOC that causes me to sulk and pissed off that evening as well as not joining for the supper event. The misunderstanding goes like this: There's this game where we have to look for a chess piece hidden by the programmers. I found it pasted by a masking tape to the inside of the roof of a stand, and removed it to shade a paper over it. The masking tape wasn't sticky so i was afraid it will drop if i pasted it back, so i put it on the top of a horizontal light, which wasn't too far from the original position, and moreover it was by the side where it could be easily seen. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#99ff99>Then as we proceeded, the programmer called and said the group couldn't find the piece. So i told her where i put it. And i heard that the other group wasn't too happy coz they spent a lot of time looking for it. (Well, so did everyone else???) When we past by them, their CGL, Baozhen, totally boh chap us. My CGL, YQ, wanted to go up and explained matters to her after the whole game ended, and i thought i should too since i was the one who placed the piece. But that bitch simply ignored my CGL when he approached her and went to the toilet! I was feeling quite apologetic initially but seeing her attitude, i was fed-up! It's just a game, girl! I went back to my room and didn't join my group for supper event. And the programmers also knew and they understood and they said it wasn't my fault too. But i just felt so ^*&amp;(&amp;*%%^.... i tink no one else in my hall has seen me like that before, so unusal from my usual self...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#99ff99>The next day things were okay as YQ told us after the debrief that Baozhen also said she was just unhappy and she wanted the FOC to go smoothly as well. So things were okay.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#99ff99>But i knew i was and am still not okay. I didn't know Baozhen well, and now i don't think i would want to know her well too. I have no mood to be high the next day also. As for the running of JCRC, i guess i will still be running to maintain my single room, but i guess certain things are changed now. Moreover, i rather be in the main comm than subcom.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#99ff99>I registered for my General Elective (GE)&nbsp;just now. Inclusive of my GE and PE (Prescribed Elective) i now have 22 AUs... Bought 2 new textbooks (Accounting II &amp; Biz Comm), will get the other 2 soon 2nd hand (Research Methods &amp; Deriative Securities), as well as&nbsp;AC208 Company Law&nbsp;that has not arrived yet. NIE campus no longer gives foolscape when we buy textbooks, somemore cannot use VISA to accumulate points... I shall buy from Popular for my Company Law textbook then...</FONT></P>"

Cycled for 3 hours plus, explored the island, climbed up a hill where the view is breath-taking, can see M'sia and even airport. Not to mention i had a slight fall, and jw went to get a lot from the Tu Di Gong temple. The people there were friendly too, and one uncle offered us jackfruit. Actually P Ubin is quite a nice place, away from all the noise, disruptions and busy lifestyle. A bit like outfield, but haa, we are on our bikes... Most of the trail is actually quite trekkable and its not that hard to navigate around. Just that upslope tends to be quite tiring, as well as some of the rocky narrow trails...<BR><BR>After then we went to meet edwin who dint join us for ICT for dinner in orchard. Went to this shop in Lucky Plaza, which food is ok la, with all the canned sharks fin, and cheap abalone... Then went to play warcraft, machiam like NS days! Haa... but we went to this shop which costs 10 cents/hr lesser than mechmaster downstairs, but its connection sucks. We managed only one full completed game in the 1 hour plus. But then it's always JW who got disconnected, so maybe it's the person... Haven't played for so long, dint know what units to build so i just anyhow... haha but with good teammates we still managed to win...<BR><BR>That's another day passed... next week it will be NBS FOC... going as SA only, so no stress, no commitments... i hope... haha... </FONT>"

DIY colour hair, expected, didnt produce the colour i wan... haiz...

As for the aspirin mask, its a DIY mask dat has generated much raves because it is cheap, effective and easy! Just do a search on any search engine and u can find many results on it... Get great reviews from other Singaporeans from <a href=""http://www.flowerpod.org"">Flowerpod forums</a> too!
It works because aspirin contains BHA, which helps to exfoliate the skin. After the mask, ur skin will feel smoother, more radiant and less blackheads! Moreover, it does not have side-effects (unless u eat it...).
<B><U>What i did:</U></B>
1. Buy aspirin tablets. Get either the Bayers brand or the Disprin brand, easily obtainable from Unity, Guardian or Watsons. Btw, dun be stupid to use panadol... they're different...
2. Drop 4-6 tablets in a clean bowl and drop a few drops of water. Not too much as it will become too watery. Aspirin dissolves in water easily, and if it doesnt, maybe u can crush the tabs instead using the back of a spoon.
3. Apply directly onto clean face, and wait for time to be up, about 15 mins. 
4. Time's up when the bits start dropping and u start sneezing. Dun rinse them out first! Gently scrub your face with the bits and make it a scrub now! Then rinse them off using warm water.
5. Your skin should look and feel smoother and more radiant, and less blackheads. Pimples may also subside by the next day.
6. Follow up with usual regime. If u r using a AHA/BHA normally, u need not use it as the aspirin mask is already one itself. </font>"

I am back after so long... too tired to come online after working for the past few days... only got energy to watch TV... haha

News report that guys are advised not to put our handphones in our front pockets, the radiation can reduce sperm production by up to 30%! Wow... first handphone radiation affects our brains, and now our sperm... Then where can I put my phone? If put inside bag, I cannot hear it ring or feel it vibrate, got some missed calls just now as a result... Paranoid? Better be safe than sorry when it comes to health...

Finally bought a new pair of earphones in Sony today when i was passing by their shop. Was fasinated by the $80 white color ones, but it just seems tooo exp for a pair of earphones. So i settled for a $29 one... Honestly does one really hear the sound difference in such a more expensive pair? But the expensive ones do look more cool. Headphones look cool too but i dun really like them, dun like the feeling of something clipping on my ears there, and may also be too fragile for my handling...</font>"

Ever since last night, when i logged in to LJ, i saw Chinese words on the homepage, in the menu fonts, almost everywhere! Is LJ trying to test the proficiency of my Chinese? At least I am glad the language is not Malay or Indian, but I still prefer English lor!

Have been replaying Ocean's songs in my computer... so nice... And i realised that Singapore is the only country where his song moves up the pop charts (Peng You Ni Hai Hao Ma? on YES 933). His album is actually released in Nov last year, but its only in this April or so that Singapore hears him... He ought to make an appearance here!

Went for the Starhub briefing just now... so tiring... Went with ZH (the only non hall 14), edwin, zhiqiang, pq n her friend, yingying n her friend. Waited for so long for the briefing to start, and the person was quite luo suo too. After that still wait for them to station us... Hope my job would be interesting... Oh yeah, will get a Starhub shirt as well! Haha... i wonder if i can 'gorb' some goodie bags as well... yeah i cs la...

Went to utilise my Giordano voucher today too, bought a pair of jeans (their tops are still quite cmi in my opinion...) and 3 pair of ankle socks. Counting the no. of socks i bought in my ICT as well, i have a total of 8 new socks, some black, some white, 1 grey... And my old socks are still wearable... I will not buy any more socks for the next year...

I am back from my 4 days ICT!! I must say that it was quite fun and enjoyable, can see my old friends once again... I was feeling quite high throughout and behaving like a siao person... haha...

We did stuff, like mortar drills... Slower than before, nonetheless to say, but I think we all are still quite zai. We did section live firing too, the first time for us as we are in support company and have never done such riflemen stuff. But its not bad, firing live rounds! No one got killed btw.. hee... And we also had our IPPT in-camp... And yay I got my silver... I managed to pass my most feared static stations, STB n SR, safely, and my running, if i was 12 seconds slower, I would have lost my silver. Can't imagine how all of us were so fit before, can't imagine I got gold before... Fitness has definitely deteriorated over this one year for everyone... I guess my occasional jogs in hall helped... h yeah, I must mention, I still hate camo...

And we did other crazy stuff too... like celebrating sw's n ray's birthdays with beer n noodles, pity we were mostly too shag by sunday night to do much. Other stuff include locking someone in a cupboard... haa... and talked lotsa stuff too, like educating the less-educated ones on sex and stuff with expert advice from people like mel... Haha!

As for the HR part, most of the platoon seemed to have changed not much, siao people are still siao, dark people are still dark, idiotic people are still idiotic. PC is still the same, we still dun like him much. Sebas, our ex-PS, is now our CSM... phew! We'll all die if we are still inder him! Cedric is now our PS, and life is definitely better... As for the rest of the specs, they also do not seem to change much and we can still get along.

I was feeling still quite energetic on the last day honestly even though i was aching all over like everyone. The ICT was like a relishment of the NSF times when trainings were slack. Although it's fantastic to go home and be a civilian once again, it means saying ""Bye!"" to everyone once again... Hope to see them once again soon! ^_^

<P><FONT color=#ccccff>It's fun and pretty slack, haha... spent a lot of time travelling. The first day was slacker, the 2nd day was tougher, me and my partner spent the entire afternoon in that sole one store for the 2nd day! It's mainly hanging up banners, slotting the ads under the tvs and hi-fi sets, climbing up n down to paste ads...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff>First day, time-sheet said ended at 7pm, reached home at 7pm... haha... coz the last place&nbsp;was close to my home anyway. For today, got home a bit later at 8 plus, but we got a free Swensens ice-cream! We got the one that is mint, with the mint ice-cream 'encasted' in a chocolate coating, that is coated with peanuts too. But it's pretty hard to bite through, i was so scared that my front teeth will fall off or get chipped!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff>Haha... pay not that high but then i like such slack n relax jobs!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ccccff>And oh yeah, i spotted a new Sony digicam in the store today that is 4.1 megapixels and cost about $400. Also got a&nbsp;mini Sony one that costs about $300... Digicams are getting even cheaper now! I need one! Haha...&nbsp; Canon Ixus seem to be still pretty expensive, maybe these Sony digicams suit me more... ^_^</FONT></P>"

"event","<P>Just checked my examination results online, and I am quite delighted with my results!</P>
<P><STRONG>AA101 - Accounting I : B </STRONG></P>
<P>Actually in the beginning of the sem, I thought I can confirm get A for Accounting coz i studied before in JC... but as it turned out, the paper was full of theory questions, i made many careless mistakes in the short questions calculation part, my acctg project was ok, not fantastic.Considering the final exam was only 55%, well actually i also dunno... Ok la, B...</P>
<P><STRONG>AB102 - Financial Management: A</STRONG></P>
<P>Yay! Even though i made a few careless mistakes, i guess my project done with ruishan was not bad. (Copied some&nbsp;stuff from my accounting project, and guess this project is done better coz i'd learnt some lessons from my acctg project...)</P>
<P><STRONG>AB103 - Statistics: A</STRONG></P>
<P>Guesss i did well for this paper coz it's very mathematical (like FM). Guess i am more mathematically inclined. Most of my friends who work hard score A in these 2 subjects as well, i wonder who scored A in the other 2 subjects... Anyway i worked hard for my stats, spending many days understanding the models and SPSS outputs...</P>
<P><STRONG>AB112 - Marketing: B</STRONG></P>
<P>A crapping subject. At least i have learnt to crap well, getting a B instead of C... i hate crapping subjects actually... My hands get so tired from all that writing...</P>
<P>I got a B for my General Elective anyway... So i have no 'C's for this sem! Yay! ^_^</P>"

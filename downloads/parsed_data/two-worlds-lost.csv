"event","i have found that when someone is in a bind it is so hard to figure out how to get out of it. i have been in so many binds in my life it's no funny. i have had so many hard times with friends, and my family and just life in general... i am wondering if i should go back to hawaii and go to school there or stay in cali and go to school here... what is there for me in hawaii? all my friends have been going in different directions, they aren't the same anymore, and it's just so hatd to see them change, and then i have been changing as well and i kinow they won't accept the changes within myself. and i am torn
i don't know what to do really. should i stay or go? then i have the other prob that if i stay here in cali i have to move out of my house and stay with friends until i get a good job and a decent apartment, and i am just going in sane... i feel myself spinning really fast out of control and when i do that i shut myself down to the point where i don't feel and i become depressed, and i don't want to do that. i'm desperately trying hard not to do that... ::poulls hair out and runs into walls::"

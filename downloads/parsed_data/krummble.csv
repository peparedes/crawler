<P><FONT color=#000099>Wednesday/ i got out early, becuase i had on-campus last period.&nbsp; so i left, though i had to be back for work.&nbsp; i did tons of errands, got some food, and then went to work.&nbsp; work was a lot of fun.&nbsp; many people were in and out and i was kept occupied.&nbsp; i met the head Sister Pat of the sisters of mercy.&nbsp; it was fun.&nbsp; i then went to cassies house to celebrate my birthday and have dinner.&nbsp; it was fun.&nbsp; then i went to choir, left early.&nbsp; picked up brendan and then picked up kim.&nbsp; we then went to starbucks, wendys, and like 5 other stores on rt. 6.&nbsp; then we took brendan home and kim slept over.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Thursday/&nbsp; There was no school because it was parent-teacher conferences.&nbsp;Kim and I met Sarah for breakfast.&nbsp; It was very enjoyable, we then went and attempted to go to Swansea mall but it was Lt. Cabral's funeral, so all the roads were blocked off.&nbsp; Of course we had a blast singing to Wicked, which is an awesome soundtrack.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; Then we went to school, because i had to drop off my budget project for Mrs. Pleasants, which was late, and we were supposed to help with costumes but that got canceled.&nbsp; since it was brendan's birthday we picked him up from school.&nbsp; i then dropped him off, got gas, and kim and i met him and anna in seekonk, where we went to literaly every single store.&nbsp; then we went to brendans house for cake and then i took kim home, did a couple more errands, and went home myself.&nbsp; I also had my interview for St. Michael's which i think went well.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Friday/&nbsp;I went to Marist College in NewYork.&nbsp; It was absolutely freezing but the college itself was gorgeous.&nbsp; the peole were extremely nice and the campus was huge.&nbsp; It took us forever to find it, and i met a really hot fire fighter who offered to take us in the fire truck to the college, but that's besides the point.&nbsp; We gave ourselves our own tour and i loved it.&nbsp; We got home around 8ish where i met adam and sarah for dinner and a night of fun.&nbsp; i got home wicked late, but it was so worth it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Saturday/ Brendan woke me up.&nbsp; i picked him and and while plotting the mission with jess aganist him we had a blast.&nbsp; i went to the car wash and him and i got a ton accomplished.&nbsp; that night was his party.&nbsp; we went bowling first, which i lost but it was fun anyway.&nbsp; then we went to dave and busters, and luckily, the 5 of us were able to find games that we could all play.&nbsp; i met tom the security guard and many other people.&nbsp; we all did the chair thing, except AJ. lmao, i love you.&nbsp; another late night.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Sunday/ went out to breakfast with AJ and Brendan.&nbsp; Then i went to church.&nbsp; Came home to help Paul rake leaves.&nbsp; The leaf blower started to smoke at me, so i did the old rake and bag method.&nbsp; i then went to Fatima, to watch my friends in The Wisdom of Eve.&nbsp; Long play, 3 hours.&nbsp; but it was good, for what we watched of it.&nbsp; then we went to cara's house, where the cast party was.&nbsp; AJ and i left and i stopped at choir.&nbsp; i then picked up brendan, and i took them to my house so that AJ could meet Betty and Paul.&nbsp; We stayed there for about 2 hours and then i finally took brendan home.&nbsp; it was a lot of fun.&nbsp; i then came home around 920ish to work on my college essay which i finally finished. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>It was definately a great four day weekend.&nbsp; group guidance is never ending.&nbsp; i gotta go.&nbsp; xoxo</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff size=2>Saturday i was supposed to go to NewYork but i did not because of many reasons.&nbsp; So instead i got up, showered, did the hair, you know, all that, and got Brendan.&nbsp; We went to the mall, made dinner for Betty &amp; Paul, and hung out until about 10ish.&nbsp; It was an awesome day.</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff size=2>Sunday was church first, singing in choir, the usual, then open house for hte academyy.&nbsp; We sang and we didn't sound that bad, some of the songs came out really good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then sat in my seat listening to the speeches, marcia newbert, my hero, did a fantastic job.&nbsp; I then took my group on our tour.&nbsp; It turned out extremely well, and was so much fun.&nbsp; I even got a few compliments, but what can i say, im obsessed.&nbsp; I then went to go and see my little sister where i was stopped and told to come home for a big dinner right away. We had a very important guest stop by.&nbsp; Makes you wonder huh? </FONT></STRONG></P>

<P>I am at work right now.&nbsp; I have nothing to do, well i do, but i am choosing not to do it.&nbsp; I am really tired &amp; i just sealed about 300 envelopes.&nbsp; one hour and one minute till i can leave.&nbsp; What should i start on?&nbsp; i am kind of excited for college.&nbsp; My giving up on life phase finally ended.</P>
<P>Some days i have so many questions that can't be answered.&nbsp; I hate that.&nbsp; haha, that was random.</P>
<P>Homecoming is tonight but i will be in vermont visiting colleges and speaking at St. Michael's College.&nbsp; I will be back on Monday seeing as how it is the long weekend.&nbsp; Tomorrow i am taking the SATs!!!! again.&nbsp; I hope i do well, i need to do well.&nbsp; I hate standerdized testing.&nbsp; ugh boring.</P>
<P>I am so happy to be back at school, though now that i work here, i notice more and more crazy things about this place.&nbsp; It's all good though, it's not very nice weather outside, which i think means the game might get canceled.&nbsp; I am in the process of getting a new car, because my car, cellica, miserably failed me and the brakes fell off while i was driving.</P>
<P>Though i would love to continue to go on and to ramble and tell you all about meaningless things that go on in my life, i feel that with the time i have left i should be doing something productive.&nbsp; After all, it all needs to get finished anyway. Mind as well start well i can. </P>
<P>I hope that you are all doing well and yea. </P>

<P><FONT color=#9999ff>wednesday&nbsp;was the wake...<BR>which was extremly sad.&nbsp; as the 12 of us ( bay view girls ) stood in line, none of us knew what to make of it.&nbsp; as we got closer there were collages that jen &amp; her sister caitlin had made.&nbsp; they all looked like there father, &amp; it was just so sad. we all went through the line &amp; then chatted with rebecca for a little bit.&nbsp;<BR></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff>thursday&nbsp;was the funeral...<BR>that was one of the saddest things i have ever done, ever</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff>thousands and thousands of cops from taxas, california, canada, and many other places came out and showed their support. i was part of the honor guard at the funeral, it was amazing to see all of the officers and the horses and well everything. when they took the body out of the hurst and lead the family into the church the officers started to shout something and then all of them at the same time gave a salute it was really touching.&nbsp;it was such a beautiful mass.&nbsp; so sad, but so beautiful.&nbsp;there were so many symbols that went on throughout the mass&nbsp;&amp; funeral.&nbsp;they had a cop car and a decestive car in front of the hurst with black blankets on the front showing the sign of mourning also with the officers badges they put a black stripe across the badge #. then there was the music and the rideless horse. it was a horse that has no one ridng on it now i wonder were they got the name lol anyway it had a black blacket on it and in the saddel was a single boot. the horse was being pulled along by the officer. the funeral was so sad and moving i cant explain it and i hope no one ever has to go to a funeral like that. i didnt cry at the funeral i got some tears in my eyes.&nbsp; i think that watching jen &amp; her mom &amp; caitlin &amp; even rebecca cry, made me more sad.&nbsp; jen &amp; her family are very strong people.&nbsp; so sweet &amp; loving &amp; caring, so sad.&nbsp; they will always be in my prayers &amp; in my heart. the mass went really well, it was sad but many of the things that&nbsp;were said were very nice.&nbsp; the euology was absolutely beautiful,&nbsp;so well done, spoken by the chief commanding officer of the providence police department, i think?&nbsp;his name was&nbsp;paul kennedy &amp; he was also a friend of the familys.&nbsp;one of the things they said at the mass was that ""life as to end, but it doesn't mean love does"" which is very true, everyone will always love and remember mr. allen.&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the other detectives, i think she was, sang a song that she wrote, which was so sad &amp; moving about mr. allen.&nbsp;the procession to the cemetary was 2 hours.&nbsp; every little thing that we all had to do in order to pay our respects was worth the time, the effort, the commitment, &amp; everything.&nbsp; jen, caitlin, marge, you are all in my prayers &amp; in my hearts.&nbsp; if you need anything, ever, let me know.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#9999ff>ohh &amp; by the way Saint Michael is the saint of police officers, if im correct.&nbsp; well im out kiddos.&nbsp; i promise that my next entry will be a happier one, like all the others, but its been one of those weeks, &amp; i can't wait for school.&nbsp; i need my school, were i feel safe &amp; its my comfort zone, my second home, &amp; i just love it.&nbsp; but i will miss the seniors who only have 18 days left.&nbsp; i love you girls.&nbsp; &amp; i wish you all the best also.</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>lets start with Drama Festival which was absolutely spectacular.!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#330099>The Bay View players are the most beautiful people I have ever met. I love Cabaret sing alongs on the way to Cranston West, Matt and Mary, the fact that Emily and Simone came to see us,&nbsp;Emily Kunkel who made my night,&nbsp;Andrew Brown and his Director pin, and being part of such a phenomenal cast and performance. It's all about the ensemble....and it was. Congrats.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6600>Drama Fest all day Saturday. We watched 8 shows, beginning early in the morning with Hendricken's ""Wall,"" which was written and directed by the amazing &amp; talented&nbsp;Andrew Brown. Every single boy in that piece, all six of them, made me incredibly proud and I just kind of sat there thinking ""I love my friends."" There were high points such as that, but there were also some very low points. I guess that is to be expected. We ate lunch in a classroom and then watched Cranston West's production of Cinderella. Matt and Mary, the absolute best hosts everrrrr, made sure to point out the horses. Haha. We went out to dinner at Nicole's, which was nice but kind of rushed. The ""42nd Street"" kids came to the DF Dance Rave instead of performing last night. The rave was actually incredibly fun,&nbsp;once i decided&nbsp;that i didn't care i had mono &amp; just went all out &amp; made the best of my time.&nbsp; I even got to do the ""Cotton Eyed Joe"" with some amazing kids! God is Good....he knows that Cabaret couldn't have afforded us winning. So we're the alternate! I'm so proud of all of the Players. We're beautiful, and sophisticated, and should definitely get the spirit award. Congrats to St. Ray's and Cranston West for moving on to the regional competition. (i have to say, i was extremely suprised by that but hey ) And congrats to Angie, Andrew, and Colin for making the All-Star cast. You guys rock my world. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff>&amp; now i just got home from rehearsal and received a suprisingly good report card when i thought it was going&nbsp;to be horrible. Other highlights of the night were when Sarah costumed me in&nbsp;a dress that finally&nbsp;fit &amp; we decided to&nbsp;dance around the costume room&nbsp;and when she sang ""Come On Get Happy."" i had soo much fun with andra &amp; with some other crazyy kids, playing w. camera's &amp; passing notes.. Oh dearrr. I love Cabaret. after school i attened the workshop since i want to run for executive board next year.. Oh how I love this time of year. Classes went well today as well. i had social issues, where we didn't do too much.&nbsp; Then i had history, where we worked on packets. for the record i love Mrs. Haines, she is soo hilarious&nbsp;&amp; that class is so much fun.&nbsp; Then chamber where we got an on-campus &amp; i hung out in Ms. Cunningham's room &amp; did some crazyy errands. then i had anatomy &amp; i disected my&nbsp;pig with Katreena.&nbsp; that was a fun time haha. ohh i love my crazyy life&nbsp;that keeps me going &amp; never lets me stop.&nbsp; i love my crazy schedules, cabaret, rehearsals.&nbsp;&nbsp;. and it's sick nasty. <IMG height=15 src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/laughing.gif"" width=15></FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#993399>yet another spectacular day.&nbsp; School was fine.&nbsp; I got to leave early to join some of my Bay View Players on our excursion to Cranston West for our Drama Fest tech run. Our hosts, Mary and Matt, were obsessed. Matt grinned through the entire run, which I found thoroughly amusing. We stopped at the BK Lounge on the way home for some dinner. Kaitlin had called ahead to warn them of our arrival, but apparently they thought it was a prank call and didn't take her seriously. I really do have an obsession with the Players and with all the crazyy fun we have. Haha. Now that was an interesting conversation to say the very least. Cabaret tonight was fun, but empty. There were five boys. It was basically a free-for-all all night and people auditioned for parts in different songs.&nbsp; yay, i auditioned for a song.&nbsp; sweet.!!</FONT></P>

"event","This week we had a 5 day weekend. It was thanksgiving.  I love thanksgiving. It's my favorite holiday. This might sound dumb but i love it because you just get to relax and enjoy the time you have with your friends and family. It's so much fun, and the foods real good, i just think its my favorite holiday. So this weekend was pretty good. I got a break from the house and the kids and ish and i just got to hang out and do fun things with ppl i love. 

It's so funny how ppl take life for granted. Sometimes it takes something drastic and sometimes its just one of those things you learn early in life. Friends are the most amazing people ever.  They help you so much with everything that you do, and you know that if it weren't for a few, you wouldn't be as far in life as your are today. So make sure you take the time to thank them and spend some time with them. It's definately worth it. Kait, i love you babe. That was so great. Thanks

well im out, have a good nite, everyone. peace <3 Steph

cp- i love you, im here for you no matter what, don't forget that"

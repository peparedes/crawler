"event","Hello every peoples! Long time since I updated. So here's WHATS GOIN ON! Past couple weeks have gone by pretty fast. I had a cooooool christmas. I got a lotta cool stuffies and hung out with Alyson and later hung out with Nate. I had'nt seen him in a long time so it was cool to catch up. Basically I've kept to myself lately. I try to see Alyson a couple times a week. I went to meet her family the other day. They were all great. I especially enjoyed meeting her grandma. We kind took turns picking on Alyson. Anyhow things are going good there. Adam told me he was busy til the 7th so maybe that'll be when this run of not hanging out with peoples will stop. Rob and I are planning on haning out one of these days... until then I guess it's poop jokes on live journal for us. I've enjoyed the quite around here (when my brother does'nt have 50 people over here.) I decided to make an X-men dating sim which Adam called ""Deliciously geeky"" I thought so too. Turns out I need to brush up on my drawing skills before I can do that. That,and try to figure out what the hell is going on in X-men. I bought a few comics and realized that without back issues I'm as lost as ever. Last night I bid on a ton of comics. Like almost 100 of em. Won em all bitch. 30 bucks! (shipping included son!) Once me and Adam had a dream of opening a comic shop. Probably will never happen but the plan was to go to e-bay and watch for comic lots... thats what I did. So my collection will be bigger and cooler now. I might have to get another long box soon. Hooray! Last night I went swimming with my mom. I swim almost a mile last night. I figure if I do that 3 times a week I'll be hot as hell in a couple o' months. I've decided to lay off the pop tarts. I used to have 2 every morning and that's like 14 fat grams and 500 calories... they are pretty tasty though. I've started to explore breakfast alternatives... Yesterday I had cream of wheat. It wasn't good. I'll have to ask my dad what he did to make it not suck when he made it. Today I had chocolate malto-meal. Major taste improvement. And no Rob, it's not just as bad as pop tarts. :P  0.5 fat grams per serving... Problem is it took me like a half hour to make it. It's only suposed to take 2 1/2 minutes... but with the getting out the pans and the measuring cups and spoons and all the mess... man it made me miss the simplicity of unwrapping a pop tart. Tomorrow I'll have Total honey and Oats. Also 0.5 fat grams. Pop Tarts are bad for you dude! Today (after Malto-meal)I'm supposed to meet with my guidance coucilor and pick my college classes. I'll register sometime this week. Tonight is my first practice with the new day singers. I auditioned for the open baritone position on Kelly's b-day. I found out Wednesday night that I made it. I was so excited! I was at Dad and Mike's at the time and Mike was out smoking. I ran outside and I yelled ""I'm in the choir!"" Just then I realized that the macho straight neighbor and his friends were in the hot tub and kinda felt dumb as I heard them snicker... Oh well... HE isnt in the choir! Anyway. The New Day Singers are in exclusive group of some of the best voices in Alpena. It's really a big deal to me to be able to sing with them. One of the Alto's is my High School Choir director Mrs. R. Who's told me to call her Jeanne now... man I am freaking excited. I'll be singing with some of my biggest choral music influences. I'm sure I'll learn a lot from them. So my path to becoming a choir director myself is paved I think. I start school on the 10th. Wish me luck me  boy-os. 'Til at later dater.

"event","Today was mostly boring and uneventful. I hate the days that I'm here alone. Every morning I wake up like it's Christmas only to find that the best reasons for being awake don't live in Alpena. BUT. I had a really good night talking and making the live journal icon to end all live journal icons. It's the NUMA NUMA DANCE ICON! And can be yours... NEVER cause I made it asshole! Took me a damn long time too! Screen shots, resizing, editing, animating... it's the kind of thing I always start but never finish. Things like that are slowly changing for me though. HEY! How do you choose which Icon you want to use? I don't want the Numa Numa dance to be my default but I would like to use it occasionally... grrr. Live jerkal..."

"event","Today me and my mom spent a butt load of time ordering my brand new computer! No more shitty freezy lame ass compaq for me! I was going to get upgrades for Christmas but we decided to just get a new one.I'll get a chunk of it paid for and then the rest I'll make payments on. But what to do with the piece of shit 5000? I figure I'll attempt to fix it up and then someday I will be like Greg Shutt and have 100 comps at my house! YAY! After that it was shower time once again and then lunch,hippies, and lion witch and the wardrobe. Mom and I fixed our outside christmas tree because there was a light that wouldn't light on one side. (The Grinch lied) In actuality about half the lights on the tree did'nt light. After about 45 minutes of tinkering with it we figured out that one extension chord got fried some how. Then we realized that the power drawn by the christmas tree was enough to blow our whole house like an enormous prostitute. So we had to run some of the power to the outlets in the garage. Anyway after that mom and I played with our my-sized glow in the dark God and The Gang action figures. The Ox has removable ear action... which is good because all these years we've been calling it a cow. It wasn't til a recent trip to walmart that we discovered our mistake. At least it did'nt hear us. My brother is going to be home at 6:00 and then we're celebration my mom's birthday. Happy 59th Ma! Hopefully Adam won't give you AIDS so much this year. I still have to get her a birthday card... FUCK! I STILL don't have any cash... debit cards are for posers man! You're a good cop, it's my job, beh."

Then I drove home, my mom yelled at me, I took a shower, ate lunch, went to a bunch of stores, and ended up with a new DVD player. For dinner we had Mancinos... it were teh tasty kids!

Why is it that when everything starts to snap into place and all the pieces of the puzzle fit, that the the finished picture isn't the one you were hoping for? As it turns out they don't make a drug to fix whats wrong with me. Maybe theres nothing wrong with me after all. At 56 dollars a pop I cant afford the burden I am on my parents. I feel so betrayed by my instincts. Nothing that I want really makes sense. Logic is really cutting me deep this morning. Why is that the simplest solution is sometimes the most difficult?"

"event","So I moved into my Dad's place yesterday and had a combination Easter/moving in day. It was pretty cool. I've been really busy unpacking all my crap and getting settled in. We had a nice dinner and afterwords we went for a walk. It was pretty cool. When we got back we had an Easter egg hunt. Everything was normal (for a bunch of adult men hunting for plastic eggs that is) until I went to open my eggs. Among the usual jelly beans and change were FLAVORED CONDOMS! Why is everyone giving me condoms all the sudden! Anyway I had to tell my dad that I wouldn't be able to use them. When he asked why, I merely looked at him blushing in complete awkwardness and he got the picture. ""Too small huh? I was wondering about that when I put them in the eggs. I old Mike Shawn has a pretty big cock, I'm not sure these will fit him."" I just sat there completely fucking amazed. I don't remember a time I felt more weird. I guess it just goes to show you, you're never to old to hunt for eggs."

"event","Ok, so I watched the movie Underworld staring, well a bunch of British people I think. This movie just pissed me off. I realize now why my darling girlfriend refused to watch it with me. She had seen this abomination before, and told me it would be one I would have to face alone. That having been said, let me break this movie down for you. A really fucking long war between Vampires and Werewolves is taking place. This vampire woman spends most of the moving driving back and forth from the vampire mansion on a quest to confuse the fuck out of the audience. Spoilers ahead... In the end this guy becomes a vampire/werewolf thing. I spent less time caring and more time trying to think of an appropriate name for the cross breed. Then after the vampire chick saves the thingy's butt (again)she walks away. The end. I was disappointed in the fact that there was an obviously love aspect between the two that A) was never addressed and B)what would you get if a vampire and a half vampire half werewolf had a baby? No one fucking knows or cares. It seems like they were running long so they cut out the ending. Long story short, do'nt watch this movie. It hurts. A lot. In fact, for those of you who have seen this movie, I have but one cure for you. That is ofcourse..."

"event","This week was an eventful one to say the least. I guess I can start back as early as our show last Saturday. That was awesome, I had a headache, but my awesome girlfriend Vicki was there so it was'nt the end of the world. We got to drink beer and act stupid on stage. That was the rockinest! Then I decided to leave my bag in the van so when I went to stay the weekend with Vicki, I had no clothes... oops. But I met the parents and they rocked, and we went to Walmart, which did'nt, but eventually it was taco bell and racist jokes for everyone at Rachel's. Monday we had a party. We got drunk... nuff said. Tuesday we drove back up here to Alpenis, fun shit. Then Wednesday the guys hated me and Vicki spent the whole day calming me down. We worked that out. yesterday was the coolest though cause me and Tofer worked on his new song after Vicki went back home :( but I ripped this sweet bass solo so I'm happy about that. Today. It was a day. Work, sleep, snacks... it was ok. Tomorrow it starts all over with another show. Our 19th I guess. We rule. :) Anyway thats all for now. PEACE

"event","Hey to the kiddies on the block with the whoo hah and the whatzit there! Well I got a live journal. So you all can read about the completely moronic pointless shit I have to say. Or the equally pointless moronic shit I come up with off the top of my head so I have updates and stuff. My girlfriend is hot. She took a picture of me. I look hot. I'm hot, she's hot, eventually our kids will be hot. So there. Put that in your pipe and go to mushroom kingdom to save the princess! BOOOOYYYYYYYEEEEE! PACE!

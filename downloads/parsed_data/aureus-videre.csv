<lj-cut text=""So..."">

So it's raining where I live...

...and by raining I mean I think that someone is building an Ark across the street.

So today, I had a quick errand to run before work, that was going to mean I would be 30-45 minutes later than usual. We're on a flexible schedule where I work, so that's not even noteworthy.

But I did not count on the rain.  The rain turned my 30-some minute delay into an hour and a half ordeal, mainly fueled by people becoming even dumber than usual in the rain.

Then my day started to suck.

So I drop the car off at home, dig out my umbrella, and head out to the train station in the rain.

Despite this shield, nice as it is, I still get soaked from the waist down.

My socks are wet, I really hate it when my socks are wet.

Because of all the delays and trouble, I miss the train I was trying to grab by five minutes. The next one didn't come for another hour.

So I sat my cold, wet ass on a colder wet bench waiting for a train that was, of course, delayed by rain (the one I missed was right on time).

Finally my train arrives, and the trip into the city is not horrible, though my legs and feet are wet and squishy.

Then I get to the city, with me having now missed nearly half the day, and I realize before I step off the train that I left my umbrella on my seat.

And wouldn't you know it, some lovely human being decided to help themselves to my lovely black umbrella in the short moment I had stepped away.

They were crafty, I couldn't track them down... lucky for them.

So then I got to walk to work, in the rain, <i>sans</i> umbrella, resulting in a now completely soaked me from head to toe.  I ended up walking into the office looking like a half-drowned cat... and about as happy as one, when most people are heading out for lunch.

I won't be taking lunch.

I have to catch up.

But instead, I'm writing this post, because right now that seems like the course of action least likely to result in bloodshed.

"event","So a lot has changed since I walked away from LJ.  My reasons for doing so were numerous, ranging from laziness to contempt for the culture I saw growing up around it.  I seems, from what I hear, that a lot of the BS has cleared up since then, and I've become more socially aware and sensitive since then as well.  My aim is to update weekly, though not with blow-by-blows of my life, but just whatever I feel like talking about at the time so long as it is SOMETHING.  :)

Posting at work right now, will work on catching up on everyone's recent posts over the next 24-48 hours (as the adventures sure to be had tomorrow may create a bit of a delay)."

Anyway, been busy... well, kinda.  I took the GMATs, kicked its ass, applied to Stern (NYU Business School), got turned down.  It was a bit of a long-shot, but I'll try again next year.

I've also been very sequestered from the outside world, every time I step out into the cold I just want to go home and shut myself off from the world.  I'm hoping that when it warms up this anti-social hibernation comes to an end.  I'm not depressed, I'm actually pretty at ease and happy... I just don't want to step outside.  By the powers Atlanta made me soft.

It seems a bunch of people didn't get my change of email address message.  It's the same prefix as before (first initial, middle initial, last name) but @gmail.com.  I apologize profusely for any messages missed due to this oversight.

I'd like to recap on so many things, but trying to catch up is crazy at this hour.  I more just wanted to touch base after another long silence..."

"event","So it's been almost a year since my last update, instead of trying to recap I'll just jump into recent events.

After moving to New York the job situation was rather rough, maybe impossible would be more accurate.  I spent a short stint as a waiter, but as the weather cooled business dried up and they let me and some of the other newer folks go.  As months passed I liquidated every tangible asset I had to feed the cities voracious appetite for money, and as things grew tighter and darker life got much more strained.  I got the occasional temp work, but in total it contributed very little.  Recently I managed to become a barrista, which while a fascinating look at the world of Starbucks, did not manage to pay the bills.  Then, just after setting things up to get a second/third job (depending on whether you count the temping) as a customer service rep at whole foods, things finally fell into place.

A company I had previously done some brief contract work with called me in for a long term/permanent assignment, one which paid far more than I had been looking at with any other opportunity I had looked at before.  It's a comfortable environment with a relaxed dress code, a fridge stocked with free soda of all kinds, and a coffee maker that makes all manner of interesting coffee and hot chocolate drinks with the touch of a button.  The hours are old school 9-5 style, and everyone is friendly and supportive.  I have no idea how I managed to luck into this position, but I'm terribly grateful for the opportunity.  It's not a financial firm (obviously, as no financial firm would ever operate in such a healthy and supportive manner), but rather a Power company.  Not a utility, you'd never get a bill from them, but rather the one's who provide power to the utilities and other commercial clients.  The amount of money flowing through just the subsidiary I work with is ungodly, which I suppose explains how they manage to take such good care of their people.  Needless to say, I'm extremely happy to be there, and they seem to like me quite a bit.

In other (but related) news I just took one of the final steps in my transformation into a New Yorker: I sold my Saturn.  I got slightly over blue book for it, which is to say not much, but given the frame damage it had I was lucky to get that much.  I hadn't used it in over a month (and rarely before that), and it was consuming an insane amount of money for a vehicle I was unlikely to use.  Still it hurt to let it go; my car served me so well for 6 years... it never had a single mechanical problem, never failed to start.  I swear the thing kept on running for miles even with an empty tank (and continued to run when the entire front end was destroyed, much to the mechanic's shock and bafflement later).  It was a hard decision to make and I will miss my car, but it was the right decision to make."

"event","So I haven't posted in almost a year now, and people are starting to poke me repeatedly about it.  I have a few free moments at work now for the first time in days, and while I should probably be doing something more productive (like apartment/job hunting) I feel I should go ahead and get back into this before I'm completely overwhelmed by the progression of current events.

Before I get into my life right now, there is a party this Saturday at our (now very barren) place, all friends are invited.  This will very likely be the last chance to see us, as we are on our way to NYC/Rome a week later.

Don't really have time to get into everything, but the whole upheaval of moving to New York and traveling to Italy is both exiting and intimidating.  All our furniture is gone except for a single futon mat (no futon) on our bedroom floor, and a desk that no one wanted to bother trying to move.  We'll tear it apart and toss it at the end of next week in all likelihood.  I'm still amazed at how much it costs for so little space in Manhattan.  I've become comfortable with the idea by now, but it's still odd to compare the lifestyle we're moving into to the one we are leaving.  Basically I'd call my life right now scary but really good, though I'd love to skip all this transition stuff.

Work is bizarre and uncertain right now; I'm training a new employee to replace me, which is a strange enough experience in itself.  They may pay me for a couple months after I move in exchange for my supporting them remotely.  I find the offer a little surprising, but if they decide to do so it would be a life saver.  By the way, to anyone job hunting: Do not just spam job offers, read the job description and offering and customize your cover letter and resume accordingly.  I was amazed at how many very dumb resumes came into my inbox.  And for the love of whatever powers you hold dear: if the interviewer calls you do not expect them to move their schedule around for your convenience!  I could not believe how unmotivated some of the people I called were.  If they call at a bad time, let them know exactly what times are or are not available and work with them to reach a mutually convenient time.

Anyway, I'll try and say more later but it looks like the company needs me for something..."

I didn't know him <i>that</i> well, but we hung out and went clubbing together, and he was a fantastic guy to party with.  A lot of fun, great energy... plus he really was an amazingly nice guy.  I can't really say anything here to do his passing justice, and I feel bad about that.

I'm pretty shaken, so I might be a little quiet for a little while, I'm particularly bad at this.

Oh, on a final note, we're coming to Chicago on the evening of June 1st, staying through Sunday.  I'm looking forward to getting to see everyone again."

I was called into the conference room of my company today, where I stood before the owner and all but one of the VP's in the company (who was out of town).  I was rather spooked, which was their intent (as it turns out, they love screwing with people they like), and braced myself for the worst.

They asked me a couple questions designed to throw me off guard, then dropped a 20% raise in my lap in my second week on the job!  I was completely blindsided, which went over rather well, and they were all very congratulatory and supportive for the remainder of the night.  Of course my night tonight was (and likely will be again tomorrow night) even longer than usual, as I now have real work to get done on my own, and there's barely enough hours in the day to get it all done even with my long days.  I made it though, at least to this stage, though there is still a great deal left for me to climb... for once though I actually have a chance to make such an ascent, and I'm quite excited by the opportunity."

"event","So I've been really quiet lately, and for good reason.  I've been hunting for a new job like mad, and kinda closed off from the outside world while doing so.  It all paid off however, I actually managed to land a job in finance of all things.  I'll spare the complex anecdotes of my acquiring such an opportunity, but suffice to say it was a bit convoluted.  In any event, I just got my start day from them, and it's tomorrow!  So I'm brushing up on everything I think I will need, and I hope that I will be sufficiently prepared for everything that is coming.

Honestly I'm a little nervous, this is a major change, and I have to start preparing for the series 63 and series 7 certifications soon.  Once I have those the money and opportunities jump considerably, but until then I have to really bust my ass to prove myself.  It's going to be a lot of long hard work, but it's a short run to the first major goal, and it will be very much worth it.  So anyway, I can't sit here and write for long, I have a lot to do to prepare."

"event","I've been silent for some time, much of my life has been confusing and the reality of my situation has been difficult to discern.  I've kept so quiet because I didn't want to say anything, and I certainly didn't want to go pointing fingers, until I knew exactly what was going on.  Sadly, I found out here on LJ (where many of the most horrific recent events of my life seem to come to pass) just how screwed up things have gotten.

As you all know I recently moved into a large home with two of my friends of nearly 8 years; Archimedes and Celelorial.  They helped both Celeste and I get on our feet, and were largely responsible for our being able to get back together.  I was so grateful and happy, despite all the complications and troubles that seemed to constantly be coming up on all sides of everyone's life at the time.  They had both come into some money, and used a portion of that to get everything off the ground.  Then a series of problems started destabilizing everything.  Both Celelorial and Archimedes' jobs fell through, leaving them unemployed, and neither did much but hit online job sites to find new work for weeks after (only recently have they gotten serious about finding work, far too late).  This left both Celeste and I worried, especially as we were all having personal space issues with one another, and the sense of community was getting torn apart quickly.  Their schedule was a late night/late day schedule, while Celeste and I were up at 6:45 in the morning.

They had a fair chunk of money saved up however, and seemed to have no problem caring for themselves and living with far heavier expenses than either Celeste or myself despite having no income.  I spoke to both of them on this issue, spoke to them about how I was worried about their current lifestyle and their financial situation.  They made it clear that they knew what they were doing, that everything would be fine, and that I could trust them.  Celeste and I had just begun our current relationship, and this relationship is the most important event in my life thus far.  Celeste is the whole of my world, and I was worried about the instability of our overall situation jeopardizing the integrity of our relationship (thankfully no longer a worry now).  When they told me that they were comfortably budgeted into fall even if they were not to get jobs, I asked them for a promise; for Archimedes to give me his word that I did not need to worry about his or Celelorial's financial situation or personal choices, and that their actions would not adversely affect Celeste or myself.  He gave it readily, saying how such worries were unnecessary.

When the house we currently live in was chosen, it was definite for the three of us, as we were not certain that Celeste would be willing to come with us.  Despite this we agreed that we would setup a room all her own, and make it as welcoming and loving for her as possible, to give her safe haven from her life at home (which was something of chaotic mess at the time).  They also told her that she would be welcome there rent free, that it was hers were she to use it or not.  Thankfully she accepted, though she at first was reluctant to let them make such a grand gesture.  As it was not my money (I was only going to be helping with the utility portion of her bills), I stayed out of the negotiations, despite my desire to see her with us, and to have her close to me and back in my life (in whatever form it was to take).  The final outcome was 5 months of free rent, at which point she would likely be fully on her feet and able to contribute fully.  She could not afford where we are now, and that was a critical issue in all of this... the offer made was the only reason she felt she could accept.

As I have said, things got strained after a while; schedules conflicted, space/stuff issues abounded, and conflict kept coming to the fore.  The central problem was a lack of communication. So that was what we forced, we had everyone sit down and bring their issues to the table so they could be discussed frankly and openly.  It was uncomfortable, and we all knew (or should have know at the very least) that it would be going in.  When you are living that close to someone it takes communication, work, and compromise.  From that point forward nothing was ever said to us about their complaints, worries, or issues unless we forced them to sit down and tell us.  Then they come out of nowhere a few days ago to tell Celeste and I that they are out of money, that they failed to hold it together like they had told me repeatedly they were, and that they were going to have to break their words to both of us.  

I was surprised, though not as much as I wish I had been.  I told them that I could not handle this after all the trust issues that had already come up, and that Celeste and I would be giving them 2 months notice then and there, as they had requested we do if things became untenable.  I thought we could make a clean if uncomfortable split, and that after a few months we'd be able to work everything out.  I thought that we could get through this, and in a year or so it would be a difficult but past issue.  I would settle up with them as I was able, and things would be ok given time and work... turns out I was wrong.  I didn't find out how bad things were until a few hours ago when I came home early from work (as I having trouble keeping anything down while there).  Celelorial screwed up her filters and I saw a post that was opened with a litany of unfounded complaints and a number of insults about my integrity, honesty (when <i>they</i> are the ones who have treated truth as a convenience rather than a virtue with me), and responsibility (again, when I'm working a full time job I hate and they couldn't even be bothered to job hunt with anything but an online search for the first two months here).  I was horrified and sickened... still am in fact.  Ironic that I'd come home early from work ill only to be made <i>worse</i> for coming home.

The only positive event in all this recent mess is that they have already found roommates for August, and are having us leave as of the 1st.  I couldn't have asked for better fortune now that it has occurred, it will make locking into a place for she and I hectic and reduce the options we have available to us, but it will be worth it to be free of the air that now permeates this place, and to be away from the betrayal that has only deepened.  For not only have they broken their word, which given the situation and how I responded to it (i.e. ending the situation and moving out) could have been forgiven in time; they have also attempted to make me out as some kind of beast... or child to those closest to me.  I've only been able to see their most recent accusations and backstabbing behavior, though I just found out that this had been happening for quite some time... and not once did they come to me to find a solution.  There appear to be a few out there who seek to judge me for what has happened, and to you I say do so... but not without all the information first."

"event","So it was a weird day yesterday.  First off, some quick background info.  I've been in debt to a law firm who took over collection of a credit card debt that I owed for about a year  or so now.  They've generally treated me like crap and have been nothing but hostile and difficult with me, sending police to my door to harass me and all (not that they ever found the <i>right</i> door).  Everyone there was awful to even speak to, with a singular exception; Lilith.  Yes her name was Lilith, which was just extra points in my book for her, as I'm already a fan of the lady (not a popular stance, but hey that's nothing new for me).  She's been the only person there who's treated me as a person, and has been helpful in getting me through this altogether unpleasant process.  So yesterday, I finally had enough money to pay off the debt in full.  Naturally, I wanted to deal with Lilith, as I'd always enjoyed doing so.  I try to patch into her desk using the phone directory, and it routes me to some random guy who's name is not even similar to the code I entered.  I ask him to transfer me to Lilith, as I'd been working with her for a while now.  He assures me that no one by that name has <i>ever</i> worked for the firm.  Moreover, he can't find my file, <i>even by the file number that they gave me to reference my account with</i>.  So he transfers me to someone who'd hopefully be more competent.  I get the exact same answers from this guy as well, so he transfers me to their receptionist to try and figure out what's wrong.  She finally pulls up my account, everything is in order, but still no reference to Lilith, and she knows no one with that name has been with the company.  So I finally get to someone who can do an EFT and close this little chapter of my life out, and the payoff for my account was about 2-300 less that I had calculated.  All great stuff, but I gotta wonder, <i>where did this Lilith come from, and what exactly just happened?</i>  Who knows, maybe she's looking out for me for some reason...

So then I go to work.  I've been working second shift for about 9 months now, and I finally had to move to regular days.  In doing so I was blowing a lot of cred with a few people above me in the company, and I was going to shafted hard on when I switched and what my schedule was going to be (the new hire crap schedule, despite my high performance and tenure).  So when I come in I go to my boss and ask ""so what's the day that I switch, and what's my schedule going to look like?"", fully expecting to have to fight to get anything out of him.  He kinda shrugs and says ""you'll need to ask <lj user=""wolfsong"">"", who is going to be my new super, and who had no problem putting me on a great schedule (actually a perfect schedule).  My boss initially resisted this sudden change, but <lj user=""wolfsong""> managed to push a perfect schedule through.  I owe everyone involved in this big (including you <lj user=""benkyouka_deshi"">, as you got me switched a week early), and I will not forget what everyone did for me.  Still, it was my last night as supervisor (I had to step down to tech to make the switch), and I had a shift to run.

I had to run the whole shift by myself... everyone else in charge was either off, or had called in sick.  Moreover, the owner of the company was in that day, and I know he was not going to like it if he found out what I had just been handed.  This all meant I had to be flawless, and train my replacement while I was doing it.  Miraculously, after all of 2 hours of working the phones, the calls died off, leaving me time to train my replacement, who by 9:30 was doing a better job of running the shift than I was.  Despite everything that happened, everything fell into place without trouble.  Everyone of my techs, and even the sales department, was unhappy to see me leave the shift, as they all told me I was their favorite boss... and I could tell they meant it.  It was an amazing day, and remained so when I got home as well... though I'm now exhausted after only two hours of sleep as I was getting the kitchen clean, and there is still so much to do today."

"event","So I'm back online again, and now I'm in my new home.  For those handful of you who were not aware, I just moved into a new house with three of the most important people in my life; Archimedes (aka: <lj user=""yi_sen"">), <lj user=""celeloriel"">, and amazingly enough, Celeste (aka: <lj user=""furison"">.  The place is wonderful, as most of you have likely already heard/read from the others.  There is still <i>so</i> much work to be done however, we've barely even moved in honestly.  Part of me still can't believe all this is real, and is waiting to wake up at any moment.

It has been a hell of a week however, everyone but Celeste moved in last Friday.  This required moving everything major from two apartments a half hour apart into our new home in one day.  I was up at 8am and wasn't asleep until 4am, and there was little time for rest throughout.  If it hadn't been for the Lieutenant (aka: <lj user=""benkyouka_deshi"">) we would not have gotten done until well past dawn (thank you so much once again!).  What's more, we didn't have hot water until about Monday when I got the water heater working (I realized the night before that the gas was on despite what the Gas Co. told us).  Celeste moved in Monday, the same day I (yet again) got  up <i>way</i> too early so I could go to Dan's graduation (the sun was brutal, but lunch was fabulous).  Thursday morning Celeloriel and Archimedes headed off to Chicago for a road trip, so they could pick up everything she had been forced to leave behind when she fled her family a few months ago.  Today Celeste got almost all of her things moved in... things are progressing nicely all and all.

It's been exhausting.  Moving, working a full time job, and trying to get everything in order as fast as my (and other's) sanity will allow, has been harsh.  I've been in significant physical pain all week, from my neck to my knees (especially my left knee... something is wrong), and it's going to take quite some time (or some work) to get my system back in order.  The house needs a tremendous amount of work (and some new appliances), and money's going to get tight very soon.  Despite all this, I'm thrilled at all the new prospects ahead of us.

Everything should be easier in two weeks, as I've arranged to move to 1st shift at work, and this will change everything for the better.  As things currently stand I'm out of synch with my household, aside from my weekend, I barely see them.  This means that despite being less than 100 feet away from three people I love dearly, I end up feeling rather alone.  Once this is taken care of, everything else will be easier.  I'll get more done, I'll be more in touch, and I'll have more time.  Hopefully I will be able to get the weekends off, powers know I've earned it... even if I don't though, Friday/Saturday off is close enough.

If you had told me a month ago that all this would be happening, that all this would actually be real, I'd have accused you of living in fantasyland.  Instead it appears the fantasy is reality as well, just so long as we can all keep it together.  There's a lot of work, quite a few tears, and a number of obstacles to get through; but I know that the four of us can overcome it all with a measure of grace, as long as we're in it together.  It's as though I now have a second family, and I will work for, support, and defend them more fiercely than I do my own blood.  I have a greater chance at happiness and peace than I've ever known before, and I will do everything in my power to see it happen."

"event","I just had an absolutely wonderful weekend, and I'm absolutely exhausted.  <lj user=""chrastan""> came down to Atlanta to visit where he, <lj user=""yi_sen"">, <lj user=""celeloriel"">, <lj user=""gaidig"">, <lj user=""benkyouka_deshi"">, and I all had a great time hanging out together again (although for some it was for the first time).  I can not begin to express how much I miss the days when we were <i>all</i> together up in Chicago, though it looks like we may get to be like that once more (with a few small changes to the cast).  As usual he didn't let anyone pay for anything... we had to resort to stealth and speed to pay for so much as <i>gas</i>.  One day, I swear, I will have revenge!  :P

<lj user=""chrastan""> crashed on the guest bed at my place, and I have to say that having the company was wonderful.  Maybe it's a good sign, perhaps I'm finally coming out of hibernation and becoming social again.  Hopefully this isn't just a spurt of balance brought on by my friend's arrival, but an actual shift for me.  Still, I am worried.  I couldn't help but notice this weekend that, <lj user=""yi_sen""> and <lj user=""celeloriel""> aside (who remain cute and happy), nearly everyone around me has been badly hurt in some deep fashion.  I myself am still recovering from my own troubles, and I have to wonder where this pattern came from... and when it will finally be a thing of the past.  Despite everyone's troubles though, we all seem to be moving forward with our lives rather well, even with the occasional setbacks.

All I know is that, as far as I am concerned, I need to pull away from relationships as a whole and just be on my own for a while.  Of course I've universally sucked at that... I can't seem to stay completely single for more than a few weeks, no matter how much I feel I need to.  The end result when I move before I'm ready is always a tremendous amount of pain, for myself or others... you'd think I'd be better at this by now.

Then there's all the <i>other</i> conflict around and within us; I see those close to me fighting so many of those around them, even each with other, in trying to get by and move forward.  It's always been a weakness of mine to see the best side of those around me, so I have trouble getting meaningfully angry with those I care about, even when they screw up hard.  Obviously I'm not a pushover (quite the opposite from what some seem to say), but I do have a idyllic view of my friends.  Still, I'd like to think it's not really a bad thing, and that I just need to learn to drop the blinders that come with such a viewpoint.

*sigh* I've got to get more productive... thankfully I have managed to get way more done tonight than anticipated, and I still have a bit of time to spare, but this needs to be the standard, not the exception.  I will get my <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/tools/memories.bml?user=aureus_videre"">full bio</a> done damn it!  I left it completely untouched for months, and I really want to get it finished.  That and I really need to get more on task with everything else, progress has been slower than I'd like."

"event","I've been all but silent on almost every front for about a week now.  I don't know if this is going to end immediately or not to be honest, but I can say that the silence is indicative of reflection and development.  I'm not sitting at home freaking out about my life or the upcoming holiday, that's reserved for when I'm at work (just ask <lj user=""wolfsong"">)... of course I'm always high strung there, so that's nothing new.  I'm undergoing yet more changes, and I'm not sure where they are going to lead.  I'm starting to grasp this new self, it's not as brightly aspected as who and what I was just months ago, but I think it may be even better, stronger... maybe even a little more down to earth (though that may be too optimistic).

These changes are still somewhat difficult for me to process... for years I've been fairly confident that I *knew* myself, suddenly I'm not so sure.  Though I know who I am now, I'm not so certain precisely who I'll be throughout this transition.  The last major change was nearly instantaneous, this one seems the sort that takes weeks.  I suppose the first was less a true change and more a ""jump start"" to whatever is happening now.  I already miss what I had, and what I was... though what I am becoming looks like it could be even better.  I'm starting to become capable of things that I never thought would be within my grasp... this has been happening since September, but it's still happening, I'm still progressing.

The upshot of all this reflection, development, and change is that my priorities have required re-evaluation.  Many projects have gone to the back burner while I focused on myself.  The irony here is that I had intended to complete my bio before really going into my journal full swing, yet two months in I'm only two thirds through it.  That's the only shortcoming I'm really displeased with, I don't like leaving things unfinished.  Thus expect to see those last two chapters written in the next week... if nothing else I'll write them when I'm at home for the holiday next weekend.  The new year is approaching, and however arbitrary that fact may appear to be; it's time for a proper <i>Accounting</i>.

Thanks to all of this, and some of the insights it has brought me, I'm also starting to reclaim my path.  For the past year I had been losing my way in more ways than one.  I felt lost and confused, and started looking for easy answers.  In coming to accept the fact that I didn't already have all the answers, I stopped looking under the skin of things, I started looking for truth without trying to figure out what truth really means (if that makes any sense).  I'm not a Buddhist, I'm no follower of Shinto, and I'm certainly no angel... and I doubt I will ever be any of these things.  So I will continue what I had forgotten; studying every aspect of every system, every story, every little facet of every little thing that I can wrap my mind and perceptions around; seeking whatever seeds of wisdom and truth are to be found.  We've all heard that ""the truth is out there""... but it's really much simpler than that: The Truth is everywhere."

"event","There is so much going on in my head right now... good things I suppose, or at the very least positive things.  I don't think I'm quite ready to put everything down on current events for public record, I still have some internal sorting to do.  However I will say than now is a time of reconstruction.  For the first time in a very long time, I have no direct sense of the future, it's both refreshing and disorienting.  I have no clue what's coming next, and I think I'm actually ok with that.  I've come to realize there's no point in being miserable, and so now I'm trying to move forward with my own life... a ""detail"" I've managed to forget these past few months.

On the more mundane level, I've begun working out again.  It's amazing how quickly one's body gets used to inactivity.  Still, I feel better being physically active, makes everything else a little more clear.  My diet continues to (oh so slowly) improve.  It's easy to eat well when your friends are feeding you, now the real work comes in... actually having the discipline to eat right under my own power.  My body is finally done with repairs, I'm <b>so</b> very glad that I am done being ill for what will hopefully be more than a year this time.  So all in all, the physical realm looks to be in good shape, locally at least.

I'm almost ready to start my bio up again, only two chapters left to go.  Hopefully I'll get that done this week.  Time was just such a rare commodity there for a while.  Then I just change my attitude and my perspective and suddenly I have time again.  Anyway, to sum up: I should by all rights be miserable, life is not in good shape in any concrete fashion, however I've refused to continue being unhappy.  So while I'm not feeling wonderful or anything, I'm not too bad off either.

I'm going to take this opportunity to do something a little out of character for my little venue here: plug a site that has kept me entertained for a couple years now.  It's called Life of Riley, and I've been in love with the story since I stumbled into it.  I highly recommend that you start at the beginning <a href=""http://www.clanbob.net/modules.php?name=Archives&action=view_strip&strip_num=1"" target=""_blank"">here</a>."

"event","The day was not so bright after all, and I find myself needing to speak of the darker side of my life this evening.  I've grown even stronger over these past few days; and the long nights, while still somewhat empty, are not so bad any more.  The trouble is the mornings.  You wake up in a large bed, painfully aware that you are too small to fill it by yourself.  There is a hollowness to the morning in these times, the loneliness keeping the light back more than any curtains could.  While empty, the bed remains a shield, as long as you remain in it you don't have to acknowledge that you are by yourself.

In the end however, one must tear themselves away from the false protections of their bed, and face the day on their own two feet.  Every morning defeated makes the next a little easier to overcome.  Sometimes fate even finds it in her heart to give you a rest, and grant a little peace and joy to your morning; be it in the love of a visiting friend or that of your dearest hearts desire.  These days only arm one further to conquer those mornings that go straight for the jugular.  Fate gives and takes, simplifies and complicates by a plan we can only begin to guess at.  Keeping faith that the purpose of our lives is a positive and in the end rewarding one makes the rest not so hard after all.

So what began as a note of aching loneliness, became a reminder of my conviction and my faith... I have much that I must face, but I believe in my future."

"event","Last night carried many realizations, more than I could ever put to words here... it seems to be a time for that.  <lj user=""yi_sen""> and I had Chinese take out while he worked on his paper and I read the first chunk of American Gods.  In this time of quiet reflection and peace, I came to know much of myself that I had not seen in some time.  I now know what has held me back for so long, and what has made the pains of life so hard to face on those long dark nights.

I have more faith, and a stronger faith, than I ever believed possible.  I believe in my quest, in my friends, in Celeste's and my future, and in all the dreams and principals I've dedicated my life to.  I have a faith in these that stands against all the world and knows that it will remain no matter what is thrown against it.  This faith has had a massive achilles heel however; I have never believed in myself.  This initially sounds crazy, especially to those that have known me for any length of time, but I believe it's actually been rather obvious.

My faith has always rested in those things outside of me, even my dreams were so large as to be so much greater than I; that my faith was little better than that of that whiner Augustine (I'm sorry but I detest the man).  I made myself small in the face of something greater than myself, so as to further reduce my own importance outside of my ""role"".  I have never really had anything that was mine, a true part of me, that I could say ""I believe in <i>this</i>"".  Even my most remarkable talents and abilities I would attribute to some other source or quality outside myself; because I never valued, or even respected, who I was.  I'm finally putting all this to rest, I'm going to stop detesting myself and my failings.  For once in my life, I'm actually going to make <i>myself</i> whole.  In fact, I seem to be making remarkable progress already.

There remains a missing piece to this particular puzzle; I must now find something of my own to truly believe in.  Something entirely internal may not be enough, I think I need to <i>create</i>.  Unfortunately my life has never really been focused in such a direction before, and I find my ability to create... lacking.  In the back of my head I'm already chiding myself, because I know that the answer I seek is very likely staring me in the face... probably has been for some time.  It's just how these things always seem to end up working.

So now I go off to get a little sleep, tomorrow has the potential to be a very bright day indeed."

"event","The morning brought some revelations.  I have been becoming dependant, and was coming to define my life by Celeste.  As much as it hurt, she may have done the most good for us both that she could have done; she forced me to face a future without her.  In my night of tears, terror, and absolute emptiness; I found that I had no real choice, that I would not <i>allow</i> myself any real choice, other than to get up and live on.  I don't know what the future will bring, but there is a future, be it with or without Celeste by my side.

I have Bladerunner to thank for my ability to recover at the speed I did... it would have taken me weeks without the amazing network of friends and allies that keep me together in my darkest times.  The potential future without Celeste looks cold and bleak, but it is there... and according to everyone else the frost fades to spring in time; though I'm not quite ready to accept that truth.

So now I work on my psyche, and I grow stronger and more ready by the moment.  I will likely be speaking to Celeste soon, as this all happened in this world before the material world... what a strange era we've moved into.  I'm sure she will be wearing every inch of her armor... but I'm done fighting.  I still love her with a passion and depth that this world rarely sees, but I can not just make an empty sacrifice of my self.  I have to live my own life, and I finally understand that.  I will speak my heart and my mind, and then we shall see what happens next.  I pray to whatever powers will listen that things are not as bleak as they appear to be, but I am ready for my future now, whatever it may bring."

"event","As predicted my body has decided to make me suffer for it's reconstruction.  Sore throat, dry (thankfully) coughing, and tons of crap coming out of the lungs now (tasty).  Still, this would have taken a week or two to get through in the state I was in, and now I'll be better by tomorrow... or at the very latest Wednesday.  Not a big deal considering how far I'd let everything collapse on me.  Getting my diet back on track (for health, not weight loss) is going to be the most complicated trick, as it's entirely new territory for me.  I know how to avoid bad things (for the most part), but I'm not sure how to really eat <i>healthy</i>; so any advice, simple recipes, etc. are welcome.  Just keep in mind my tendency to make Armageddon come out of a pan.  Thankfully my nerves seem to have fallen in line with my demands, the shakes are almost completely gone, and that will be resolved in no more than a day.

I have to admit, conviction is never as easy the morning after, but it's still there... I just have to keep my head about me.  Things are still a little weird and slightly confusing, but that's only because I'm letting them be.  I really have no reason to worry; I know what's going on in my life and why, and it's a good and positive thing (just a little intimidating at times).  So in conclusion, I've got it together and I'm keeping it together.  Now I'm just looking forward to the weekend where I should not only be fully recovered, but will hopefully get to see the woman of my dreams again.  If not, well... I'll find something else to occupy me and relax, taking the time to work on myself.  So wish me luck, though hopefully I'll not need it so much from here on (except perhaps in getting through work today intact... not going to be fun)."

"event","So while I may still be a minor mess, as much of my life is remains in the ""resolution"" phase, I am tired of tearing myself apart every night worrying about things I should have stopped worrying about over a week ago.  I've always been the sort to panic over even minor things, and it's lead to a constant aching in my life for a sense of peace.  I have finally realized that I do not know peace because I do not trust the world.  I may trust a person, but I do not trust the world to not make moves to invalidate that faith.  Anytime anything good happens the smallest irregularity leaves me spooked and afraid that my whole life is about to collapse... so it's a no wonder that things have done just that.  This behavior is going to stop, and it's going to stop now.

On top of that I'm pulling myself out of this mess I've built for myself in my head.  I'm re-weaving my lungs back together by force of will as I write this, and I'm pulling my nerves back into proper alignment as well.  Once I've finished repairing my body it's back to the blade, and I <i>will</i> have my old form and talent back.  I'm going to be healthy, and I'm going to be happy.  Let fate bring it's slings and arrows, I will bring cannon.  I refuse to live in pain any longer, I will <i>live</i> god dammit.  I let fear claim me, the one thing I refused to let hold power over me I nearly surrendered to... but not again.  I will not just be strong, I will be alive and well.  I have more to look forward to in my future than most people will ever have the fortune to know, I've a magic and wonder in my life not seen in a thousand lifetimes.... I'll not let human foolishness lessen it's value.

Yeah, I'll have weak days and dark nights... hell tonight <i>was</i> one, and my time at work always complicates matters... but these will be moments, not meaning.  Heh, the body's a little taken aback by my sudden drive, and is trying to relapse on me.  Tomorrow is going to <i>hurt</i>, but I'll be better shortly, and it will be worth the small pain to be whole again.  I must thank those that were there for me in my dark nights, it was a very lonely road to walk... though thanks to you it was also a short one.  I must also thank fate for it's small show of support today, I stumbled into a friend of mine I've not seen in a while on the streets of Atlanta.  Her words and timely appearance gave my brain the jump start it needed to get where I am tonight.  So my hat is off to all, my life's been an amazing story thus far, and it looks like it will remain so for some time.

So now I'm either off to rest, or failing that to become a scantily clad cantina dancer..."

"event","<b>Chicago</b>

After graduating from the UofC I got a job as a systems consultant for a Chicago based consulting company.  I didn't start right away, as I wanted to take a month off before I jumped into the real world.  I moved in with Caliban and a couple other friends who were approaching the end of their lease, it was a good arrangement for me to figure out where I was going to go next.  Fraelin had gone off to Boston and then to Oregon for some archeological work, and I still couldn't let her go.  Eventually I settled into the city outside of the ivory tower, and initially it was not as difficult a transition as I had feared.

Shortly after settling in I began my new job.  By all accounts it was a pretty sweet deal; descent pay, good benefits, short hours, infrequent travel, and the job was not particularly stressful in and of itself.  There were some complications however.  First off the CEO and I started butting heads immediately, now while this is not a scary as it may sound (the company was rather young and firing me would have been very hard due to company charter), it was not healthy for my work environment.  On top of that I was told to be as inefficient as possible when on any job site; this was both antithetical to how I do things and simply dishonest, both of which chaffed considerably.  Then they had the lack of foresight to move me to sales (as the CEO did not trust me to work in the field I believe).  This made things much worse, I was neither pushy nor deceptive, both of which are apparently required for a pro-active sales role.  I found my feelings turned from discomfort to disgust, and I began to dread every day that I had to face the office.

I had my own failings where the job was concerned of course.  I was very open with my feelings and opinions about the way things were handled in the company, and this lead to the conflict with my CEO.  I had a poor work ethic, my discipline was barely noteworthy, and I was completely stressed about my home life.  All in all I was slowly becoming a complete wreck, and had no idea how to keep myself together while working a full time job.  While I was ecstatic and enthusiastic about work for the first few months, after only six months there I was so miserable I wanted anything but to face 8 hours in the office.

While that was all getting started I met a gorgeous 6'2"" Amazon named Heidi, and she drew me in like a moth to flame.  We hit it off right away, though she was in the middle of a rather complicated relationship situation at the time.  Neither of us were looking for anything serious, and she was living in my hometown of Louisville while I was in Chicago.  We decided to play it by ear and see where things went.  For a while things went just about everywhere, and rather well at that.  However, when you only see someone for a weekend out of any given month, there's much you never see.  As such I didn't see her pulling away from me and into someone else's arms (and home) until it was far too late.  Just as I was starting to fall for her (not seriously, but she had become very important to me), she left me.  It was not a clean or clear break, she just started ignoring me until a friend of ours (though not hers any longer) told me what was going on.  It was painful, but on top of everything else that was coming, it was just fuel for the fire.

Back at home things were getting very interesting.  Caliban and I managed to persuade Fraelin to move in with us in his old apartment when she returned from Oregon.  I had hoped that it would bring us together, and it did... messily.  Things looked good for us initially, but she was not over her current/recent SO, and this obviously complicated our getting back together.  Life began hitting me from all sides and I handled what was left poorly enough to make sure that nothing was going to work out properly.  We had a bad start, and never really recovered.  Fraelin and I became a co-dependant mess; we loved each other, but there was too much pain, anger, and desperation for us to overcome.  One night we'd be fighting and the next she'd be holding me as I had a nervous breakdown.  I can only imagine what all of that did to her, though I think the wounds have finally healed for us both after all this time.

Finally with everything tearing me apart, I decided to quit my job.  I didn't know just how bad the market had been hit by the recent tech crash (yes I quit just AFTER everything fell apart... brilliant), and believed that I would be able to find something as good without too much pain.  I was completely wrong of course, though if I'd had any clue as to how to actually FIND a job I might have had better luck.  I quickly realized I had few truly marketable skills (most of those were developed on the fly later), and didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life.  I ended up unemployed for 3 months, paying everything with savings and, when that ran out, credit.  I was broke and barely functional when I managed to get a job as a temp, doing data entry.  Initially I felt pretty pathetic taking such a huge drop in both career and pay, until I realized most of my co-workers were in similar situations.  After a while I found I liked the regularity and simplicity of the job.  I woke up, went to work, sat down and put my 8 hours in without worry.  I had total control over my schedule and there was no pressure, I was good enough that I was left to my own devices.  Had I not been up to my eyeballs in debt I would have been fine with the considerable drop in income, but three months with high bills and no money made sure that I wouldn't be able to keep up for long even with the new job.

I had lost Heidi, quit my job, and things with Fraelin had reached an all time low.  Though after far too many very dark nights, I was finally starting to put my life back together.  During this time of slow recovery I met Masha.  Masha was a friend of Fraelin's that I met at a small get together, where she made a very obscure theatrical reference which I immediately caught (thanks entirely to blind luck, I was reading that very play at the time).  After that moment of fortune we got to talking, and I found I loved her attitude and her company.  We attempted starting a relationship briefly, but realized that there was no way we could make it work, our lifestyles at the time simply could not come together.  We did eventually manage to resolve the tensions between us and become friends, though I don't think she ever realized how strong my feelings for her really were.  I was actually a bit crazy about her, and remained so for some time afterwards.  I always regretted that things never went better, and actually felt a little guilty about it; though now enough time has passed to make it a non-issue, we are close friends now and those times are past.

As I was slowly reassembling my life, it became clear things were not coming together as well as I needed.  Money was still falling short, and our lease was coming up for renewal.  I realized that I was not going to be able to stay in my situation without declaring bankruptcy, and I was not about to give up after finally coming out of everything.  I was also becoming aware that it was time for me to leave Chicago behind... there was simply too much pain and mess for me to be able to recover while I remained in the city.  Things with Fraelin were over, and I was starting to disrupt things among my friends in Chicago as well.  It felt that if I remained I would risk polluting their lives with my problems, and that would only make my failure complete... they were really all I had at that point.  So I made a very painful decision; one that hit my pride, though not as deeply as a similar one I'd make later... I moved back in with my family.

<b>To Kentucky and Back</b>

My family had moved from Florida to Bowling Green Kentucky while I was in college, and while it was an absolute hole of a town, it was relatively close to both Louisville and Nashville.  For a few weeks I simply spent my time at home recollecting myself, and making progress in the re-assembly process while I sought out work.  With most of my costs removed I had more options available to me, though I ended up stumbling into the best job I've ever had; Dell Computers.  I landed a job working sales in the Dell call center, which may not sound wonderful, but Dell is an amazing company to work for.  I've never, before or since, worked somewhere and felt that they were actually doing things <i>right</i>.  That might explain why they were successful even during the recession...

Though it was a sales position it was very different from my past experiences; there were no lies, and little real pressure.  I believed in the product, and we were not asked to misrepresent anything in any way (except maybe the realities of credit lines).  I was able to quickly earn the friendship and respect of both my co workers and my boss.  Amy Worley was the best boss I ever had, I fear I will never have the opportunity to serve under such leadership again... I suppose that's why I always end up in the lead.  The company took very good care of me, and the money was better than anything I'd seen except with the consulting company.  The work was hard, and the commute was brutal (70 miles away, about an hour and a half each way), but it was a job I could feel good about... something I've yet to see anywhere else.

With the money I was making, and the significant drop in my expenses, I was able to pay off some of my debts, and get caught up on others.  I put in more hours, especially when you consider travel time, that I have anywhere else; but they had earned my loyalty.  I spent what little off time I had at a coffee house in Nashville (the location of the call center).  There I met some interesting characters, including a fiery but broken little redhead.  What started off as an interesting fling became an interesting little relationship.  Unfortunately she was looking for a white knight... and I was certainly nothing close to a knight, and certainly not a white one.  I could not save her from her own life, and while I was perfectly willing to help her, I was not about to pick her up and carry her.  So we split as I started making plans for my return to Chicago.

It was only about six months total that I worked for Dell, as I signed on for a seasonal shift.  They offered me a permanent position, and I could have made literally twice what I was making as a consultant a year ago... but I knew there was nothing for me Nashville, my life would have turned up empty had I remained.  So instead I began to make plans for a return.  All the while a small voice was telling me to look south, to Atlanta instead.  I ignored this voice, focusing on my desire to make a return in full glory; I was in for a let down once again.  I lined up a job with my old place of employment in Chicago, and found a good 3 month sublet that I could use to find a more permanent residence while I was actually living in town.  It was with two female college students, who were surprisingly open to the idea of my moving in.  My being a recent graduate of the same college likely made the idea more comfortable for them, giving the place more of a college feel than a ""creepy new guy feel"".

So I made my return, and things immediately began unraveling.  My job fell through, and again I did a poor job of digging up new prospects.  I had saved money just in case something went wrong, though I had intended to use it in moving into a permanent residence.  Thankfully the living situation turned out very well, my new roommates and I got along wonderfully, and I had the good sense not to try anything with them while I was there.  I started up a couple new groups, and my relations with my friends were healthier than before.  In addition I found myself becoming closer to another circle of friends that I had not really gotten to know in depth until my return to Chicago.  It was through two good friends of mine that this occurred; though for now I will simply give them the designations ""The Hermit"" and ""The Knight of Questing"", as they fit my associations for them (Introspection/Guidance and Impetuousness/Expression, in a positive fashion, respectively).  I will definitely go into detail about these people and the full addendum to the cast at some point, but that will have to wait, as I am already running longer than planned.  Much was being built, but it all relied on a foundation made of glass.  Needless to say, it shattered.

I never got a job while in Chicago, despite the best efforts of my friends and allies, and I was thus never able to find a more permanent residence.  So at the end of my three months, I was forced to leave Chicago again... this time in failure as opposed to being part of a conscious decision.  A lot of things got left undone and unresolved, and I feel that I failed more than just myself, but that I also failed all my friends and loved ones.  I was simply not yet ready, I was still a kid and did not know how to handle my own life.  I was not yet responsible enough to build a life of my own, and did not yet know what I was really working for.  I was ashamed, and it took a long time to come to grips with that shame, in fact I only recently overcame it when I proved to myself that I can in fact stand entirely on my own if I have too (at least in the everyday sense, without the moral support of all those I love I would never survive).  So I returned to Kentucky, broken and beaten... cast out from my home by fate's whim and my own weakness.



I fear I must leave my story at that for tonight... which means I still have two chapters left to write.  Ah well, they will get written in due time, but for now I require rest.  Hopefully a true rest is coming up... I have to say that however complicated things may be, the future looks bright indeed.  Good night; to my loved ones, my allies, those I do not know, and even those who would call me anything <i>but</i> friend.  I finally feel accomplished again, and it feels as though things are back on track in my life, despite having had a rough weekend.  I'll see you all soon, in some way, shape, or form."

"event","I find myself taking much longer to get things done then I had foreseen.  I'm going to try and write the next chapter tonight, but honestly I don't know if I have the drive to get that much done.  I seem to be suffering a relapse of sorts; and for all my focus of putting my body back together, the stress of things seems to be pulling it apart none the less.  I do not wish to imply things are not looking good, they are, but the stress has not yet passed.  There appears to still be a fair amount to get through before everything is truly settled and happy.  I'm looking forward to the future with a peace and optimism that I've never known before, but it's still a rather lonely night.

I was considering going out, as I've not left the apartment all weekend except to pick up a few things I needed (thanks again Laironno), but it seems everyone I know has fallen off the face of the world tonight.  Oh well, maybe I should just get some sleep... powers know I've not been getting enough lately.  More likely I'll actually motivate myself to focus on something positive and productive (like writing) and pull myself out of this mood, as that would probably be the wisest course.  Ah well, however weird the next couple weeks may turn out, things are looking good and I have no real reason to be unhappy about it.  So yes, having now put my running thoughts out to the public, I'm going to pull myself together and get something DONE.  You should all be hearing from me again real soon, and I think I'll be in better spirits come then."

"event","The past weekend is one I will remember for the rest of my life, and thus I feel I must skip ahead in my story.  The Wanderer, Bladerunner, Celeloriel, and Laironno banded together and came to see Celeste, Archimedes, and I this past Friday.  A full narrative can wait until a later time, but it was absolutely wonderful.  There were, as tends to happen during intense times, rocky moments; but they passed uneventfully.  We bonded as a family again, which we hadn't done in a very long time.  My soul was fed and restored by the combined joy of my old companions and the infusion of Celeste's energies into our bond.  She and Celeloriel were even closer in person than I expected, and it was wonderful to see them together in person.  It had been so long since I'd seen such life in Celeste's eyes.  Actually everyone took to Celeste as well as I had hoped, and quite honestly as I had pretty much expected.  She is the most amazing and wonderful force I have ever experienced in my life, I don't know how anyone could react differently.

This weekend was a powerful catalyst, and much occurred that caught many of us by surprise.  Most of the details surrounding these events will have to wait until a later time, but suffice to say many livers changed, and I'm fairly certain for the better all around.  To finally have a real amount of time with Celeste, and along with some of my closest friends no less; was a joy beyond words.  Some of the walls Celeste had built up to protect herself from her situation came down this weekend, and I finally saw the eyes of the woman I fell in love with again.  At that moment my soul cried with feelings no words can ever convey, and a measure of peace has been back with me since.  It appears that the weekend has brought some resolution to our lives, and it looks like everything is going to be alright.  There is much to be done before we can begin the next chapter of our lives together, but it will all be worth every moment we've endured.

I'm exhausted and I can't help but see that my writings' quality is unraveling by the moment.  My father came by after everyone left Sunday, and dropped off all my furniture and the boxes of stuff I had left in Kentucky.  My home is now trashed, even though I've spent the past few hours effectively moving into my own home again in attempt to clean it up.   That combined with the fact that I've barely slept, and the sheer emotional exhaustion (however wonderful) of the past few days makes for a rather deadish Aureus.  So now I'm off to sleep in my own bed for the first time in 8 months."

"event","My writing is going to be a bit delayed.  Today has been less than conducive to productivity.  I think I'm just going to boot up SWG, and lose myself in another world tonight.  So far this evening has been far too... dumb, to continue anything meaningful.  Never let it be said that I'm not happy to have the job I've got now, but there are nights I want to reach through time and space and electrocute our customers.  <sigh> Anyway, just needed to vent, and where better than my own journal.  

Tonight I do not feel so much like me, I just feel tired... if that makes any sense.  The next couple nights will have me back in full swing, and hopefully in full form in general, but not tonight.  Tonight will be a night to myself, with no point or plan.  It's been far too long since I've had such a night, so this will probably be good for me."

"event","Well, maybe writer's slow traffic.  Tonight I'm unfocused and distracted, I'm not sure by what though.  Thus, I'm having trouble getting the next chapter of my life into something coherent.  Tomorrow night I should have college done.  While I really want to get everything out, I also want to be sure it's done right.  There's a lot in here that not many of you reading this will have known previously, and college was an insane and overly active time in my life, therefore there's much to cover.  This one's probably going to be another massive post, so it ended up taking longer than I thought.  And here I thought I was going to be able to cover everything in one night... <sigh> these projects of mine always end up being way bigger than expected."

"event","Not a lot of time to write this evening, and I'll be getting up rather early tomorrow.  Looking back at my last writings it amazes me how much came out, and how much was left out.  Perhaps it's for the best, I believe what was written has more bearing on who I am now... despite the unquestionable power of those things not said.

That aside, I should lay out the cast of this rather strange tale before continuing any further.  The people in this particular chapter have all been far too much of an impact in my life to leave their stories, at least as they relate to me, untold.  This is particularly true of the years following my arrival to Chicago.  Still, there is so much to be said, I simply don't have time to finish this evening and maintain any degree of coherency at this point.  My commitments have largely dissolved for the weekend (with a singular wonderful exception), so I will begin with the Cast and Crew of my story in a day or two, depending on how the next few nights go."

"event","With some proper introductions... I warn you, the below is a rather complete bio and is kind of long.

I suppose I should start with myself, and for that I shall start at the beginning.  I was born to a couple of hippies living in Appalachia.  One year we'd be successful and living well, the next we'd be in a rented shack on a rural farm in the backwaters of Kentucky.  My father was a musician who lost his ability to a winch accident when I was very young (a guitarist with no fingertips tends to be left behind).  He then became a nightclub owner, and a rather successful one at that, until betrayal at the hands of his partner cost him everything.  He ended up waiting tables to get by, and slowly worked his way up the chain of an industry he had no taste for.  All in all he could have become an embittered alcoholic and few could have blamed him.  Instead he got through it all and remained a largely happy (if stressed and at times troubled) man, and a caring father.  He eventually retired and founded a charity with my mother dedicated to renewing arts and music in the schools.  My mother spent most of her life working random part-time and full time jobs to help make ends meet.  She was not as wild or crazy as my father was in their youth, and many believe that she saved him from himself by providing the counterweight he so badly needed in his life.  The more reflective and spiritual of the two (which is not to short change dad), she's always been seeking an understanding of the world and how to make it work in her life.  She became an accomplished healer, though ironically I doubt she realizes it.  There have been more than a few that are convinced she's actually a dragon, though it's a very one-sided view such individuals have had of her.  While the partnership I was born into was definitely a good and powerful one, it has not been without its troubles.  My parents were divorced for a couple years while I was young, but they quickly realized there was no other path that was right for them but one that was together.  Both tried through my youth to finish college, but neither could stick to it.  Obviously, I got very lucky when I landed this family.

Once I started school my family started to become responsible, and start working for the future in a healthy and constructive manner.  Basically, they grew up.  Around that time they had a second son, and while it seemed like a good idea at the time to me, I'd have to call the project a failure.  For the first few years he and I got along fine, but the age difference caught up around the time he started school, and we were at each other's throats from that point forward.  I've been at the edge of killing him on more than one occasion, and I swear it is by simple fortune that I didn't end up killing him in the last few years we had to live in the same house.  He's only now beginning to grow up, and it's about a decade too late.  Things between us now are ok, relations are cool at best, but things are fine now.

So while there were rocky points and aspects, my family life was well above and beyond the norm for current times.  I was very lucky, and I realize that fully.  Still, it was not without it's stranger aspects.  Religion was something avoided by the family as whole, both my parents were raised in oppressively Christian households, and wanted to be sure we had the freedom to choose our own paths.  I certainly did that, and again I am grateful for my fortune.  We moved every few months to every few years because of my fathers changing work environment, so I never had a place that was really ""home"".  This left me feeling apart from the rest of the world more than I already did.  It has been said repeatedly that I never really had a childhood, that I saw everything for what it really was shortly after I was able to talk.  There was little childish naivete, and less blind optimism.  I was growing dark before my teens, though only in the slightest of shades then.  I was a very happy child, though I could never really explain why until recently.  Looking back I realize that I was alive then, and saw the world for the wondrous place it really was.  Something I didn't see again for a decade and a half.  I was a mystic child as well, my superstitions were not the usual clueless leaps of illogic and faith that most kids had, though they certainly lacked the sense or logic of a more adult mind.  I sought to understand the world in my own way, which later led to a complete drop of mysticism and a forsaking of the supernatural in exchange for the rational and scientific.  I wanted power because I had so little, and that powerlessness resulted in tremendous pain.

Even as a young child I was on the outside of society, at first just because of my incredibly small stature (I was about 2 years behind in growth and physical development) and strangely aware outlook on the world.  Later I started learning everything faster than everyone else, less I think due to some inherent brilliance than due to a supportive family and an availability of intellectual material to consume.  As we all know, that did not make one popular in those years of life.  Once you start moving so often that long-term bonds are impossible, you're a guaranteed outsider.  Now take said outsider to the worst areas of redneck infested West Virginia, and you've got quite the adventure on your hands.  Within a single year the daily beatings and physical abuse were in full swing.  My only solace was one day a week I was freed from the day-to-day classes to be taken to a special accelerated school an hour away.  There I made my real friends (as opposed to the handful of people who would allow me to spend time with them because it was convenient).  It was a wonderful experience; unfortunately the pains of the rest of my life there drained much of the life from it.  I lived in fear of facing a new day, and developed insomnia (I feared sleep because I knew waking up meant another day) and a number of very real physical ailments caused by stress.  I stopped eating, making my already small frame particularly frail.  Eventually I fell completely into psychosis, having regular breakdowns and ""episodes"" where my parents were afraid for my physical safety.  I don't remember everything that happened during that time, both due to ""black outs"" and the occasional memory loss from physical damage sustained at school (only once or twice I believe).  Every morning I was sick, and I grew into a very dark and angst-ridden teenager (there's a new one).  My parents finally realized that no amount of therapy or help was going to work as long as we were in that hellhole, so despite the financial success we enjoyed there, we moved.

The six months that followed were transitory, and completely unworthy of mention.  Eventually we moved to Louisville, KY.  Here I had my whole extended family, and a fair number of good memories supporting me (it was my home when I was very young).  It was the closest thing to home I had ever known.  Here the pains of the past, and the lessons learned therein, would take me far.  I was immediately surrounded by friends, and never saw the hostility and anger that I had grown so accustomed to in my day-to-day life.  My performance at school shot up, and I actually found that the worst part of the day was waking up in the morning and doing homework... kind of new concepts.  I then made a very odd decision; I opted to triple my travel time to school to go to an inner city high school known for its somewhat dangerous student body.  The shootings stopped happening a year or two before I started attending.  My reason for this was not completely bizarre, they were supposed to have an excellent law program and a good computer science program (the high schools had specific focuses at the time), both were fields I was interested in pursuing a career in.  So I went to a school that by all rights I should have been terrified of.

Turns out the adage ""an armed society is a polite society"" applies in a weird way to high school.  When there is a very real chance the guy who just bumped into you is carrying a gun, you don't start something over nothing.  All the fights were started by out of area kids who were confused and felt out of their element.  I myself never having felt ""in my element"" didn't see anything to strange about the whole situation, and ended up making quite a nice little social niche for myself.  All societies need someone to ""be on the outside"", and when you can fill that role while remaining an approachable and productive member of said society you can end up with quite a good chunk of status and respect.  Then I got into an interesting little altercation that changed the way I would be viewed for the rest of my life.  It wasn't a big deal in reality, some punk who did a good job of taking big started something with me, and I blew him off.  When he started making threats I told him to throw down or screw off.  So finally (after about 20 minutes of bluster) he hit me in the face... poorly.  It was a glancing blow, but it looked like a powerful haymaker.  I had been studying martial arts for a while at this point, and while I was yet to be a fighter of any quality, I wasn't some twig anymore either.  So I took the hit and barely flinched.  I then remained calm and let him continue his pathetic strikes for a short while, all the while telling him that if he didn't stop he would be hurt badly.  On the sixth punch or so, I grabbed him by the collar, threw him to the ground and made good on my threat.  I was pulled off of him, and went back to calm and collected (adrenaline barely kicked in for some reason).  We had drawn quite an audience by this point, and after that his rep was nothing, and mine was unlike anything I had ever thought possible.

From then on I carried myself with a confidence (and viciousness) that I had never had before, and with it my rep and respect continued to climb.  Rumors made me out to be cold-blooded killer, or some completely batty psycho, and I reveled in it.  My darkness was complete at that point, and it was my sword and shield against the rest of the world.  I started to learn how to actually fight, though I never needed to after my display.  By my third year I had sycophants all my own (only a couple, as I was usually avoiding them) and an aura of fear and respect no tiny white kid should be able to pull off in an environment like that.

Ironically outside of school things were completely different, and as I grew school became less and less a facet of my identity.  By the time I was the dark monster of my high school, I barely acknowledged what I had, as I no longer really wanted it.  The point had been made, and I had moved on to bigger dreams.  Early in my time there, two major talents had been unearthed by fate.  One was my love and talent for the blade.  I started fencing and had beaten every member of my class (except one) by the end of my second week.  I loved the work and I loved what it did for me.  I felt alive and healthy again, though I probably wouldn't have used such words at the time.  There I met my first girlfriend, another fencer.  Not surprising, it wasn't until I had started the art that I felt confident enough to open myself up to a relationship (though at 14, that's not exactly late).  I was one of the best in my class until my instructor told me he wanted me to train for the Olympics.  As he was the Russian Olympic coach a few years ago himself, I knew he was dead serious.  In less than a month I was gone from the class without reservation, my art forgotten.  I had no intention of sacrificing my youth for another mans glory, no matter what the benefits to me might be.

The other talent involved the re-awakening of my mystic self.  My rationalistic and scientific view of the world was forcibly torn away by an event that while definitive and key in my life story, is best left told another time.  Those events were not only very personal, they also involved the secrets and stories of many others, not all of which want such information made public.  I will certainly address any questions that may come up, and happily tell my own story, but much must be left out here for others privacy and well-being.  Needless to say, I underwent an awakening.  One that left me changed forever.

Most of my friends were developed through these channels, and those of my hobbies as I had few close friends from school.  The most significant said hobby was gaming, which went from geeky anti-social pastime to high art by the time I had cultivated it.  A well crafted story woven by a director and a number of improvisational actors acting in harmony is an amazing and powerful thing, and a real trick to actually pull off.  And I seem to have a hell of a talent for doing just that.  Through this I have developed an amazing network of friends and allies.  And it remains to this day a source of great joy and pride.

After almost five years in Louisville, I had succeeded in most of my short term goals, and gained a life I had never dreamed of previous to my arrival.  This did not come without failure, cost, or consequence mind you... but those details would make this three times the length it has already been, and will be explained in detail if and when they become relevant to the story.  Much is left out of the biography told thus far, and I'm sure I will miss many details of what remains to be told.  From Louisville I headed off for college, to The University of Chicago.  There my life changed completely in just a few short years, but that story, and the full cast of characters that played such a powerful role, and continue to do so to this day, will be described in later days.  Hopefully I will be able to complete this tomorrow, but there is much to do, and it may take a few days to get everything together and complete the background of my path.

Time has gotten away from me, and I am long overdue for some sleep."

"event","The past three days have been leading up to a rather intense house cleaning.  For those of you in the know, I'm sure you can understand why.  For those of you not in the know, you'll understand soon enough... once I finally get this little electron house in order and begin proper introductions.  Suffice to say the shadow cast over my home is banished, it's implements removed, and the air cleansed.

I will begin introductions, of both myself and others, tomorrow.   Though it will take some time to assemble the whole cast as it seems to be constantly growing.  Soon I may need to step fully into the arena that has formed here, as it is an extension of the one I have been immersed in back in the real world.  My silence no longer enforced, I don't know how much longer it will remain."

"event","So I finally broke down and stepped into this little corner of the digital world.  Much to do, much to build, and so much to write.  Unfortunately as this took much longer than planned, I'm now exhausted, and just need sleep.  No worries though, there will be much in the coming days.  Honestly it will likely take a week or three just to lay out the groundwork, cast, and history of events sufficiently to start on current goings on."

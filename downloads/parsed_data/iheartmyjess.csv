"event","well today me jess and shell hung out all day and it was all going good.  Eof had band practice and so we heard them play and did some hw you know the same ole.  Well jessica saw alex from a distance and broke out in tears, i didnt know what to do she was so sad i just wanted to give her a big hug and tell her that everything would be alrite.  i know that she is going to end up getting hurt and i want her to get away from all that as soon as possilble cause i just want her to be happy.  It gets me sad to see her like that cause i know that she could be so happy but love has hit her and she cant get rid of it.  I just wish that she could see that no matter what happens she isn't happy with alex because everytime she sees him it just brings her tears. arggg. but i still love her. night time </3"

"event","wow well today is turkey day so im running around my house trying to get ready for all the stuff that is going to be happening today.  Last night after i got home from my trip i went and gave shell and jess thier presents, i hope that they really liked them.  Well we talked for a while and then i had to go home i gave jess one last kiss and went on my way.  Then i went over to rays house and hung out for a while and then i came home.  Today me and jess had a talk and it seems that i overwhelemed her with things but i still want her to trust me because i want her to understand that i really do care for her and that no matter what ill always be there.  I just think that if i would have taken things slower it would have been amazing lets just see how this turns out but no matter what ill always love her..................<3"

"event","omg about effing time i finally got my class ring.  Its so pimp cause its green and has all the stuff that i like to do on it, we have to do the whole turny thingy and the last person has to be someone special.  I think we all know who that is going to be.  Well today i got up super early so that me and matt could go buy some goldfish from walmart and mine is HUGGGGGGE, like a giant.  i had golf today after school and i was owning it up it was lots of fun... yea i saw all the little hot girls today (amazing) and tommorrow ima talk to that girl ashley (i think thats her name) and see what the hell is going on.  If she has no one im going to see if i can get to know her better.  If not theres always all the other girls lol.  I think that just looking for any girl is bad since i just base it on there looks im not usally like this but i need someone to fill the empty space in my heart.  I hope these girls can handle that."

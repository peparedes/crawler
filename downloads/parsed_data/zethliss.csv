"event","Oh well I've finally gotten around to another update.

Now that I've started I've just realised that I have no idea what to write about.
I went to Simon and SArah's joint birthday party at the weekend. Unfortunately both Em and I had to be up early on the Sunday morning for work (though paid at double time on sunday for me so financially more rewarding) so we would up leaving early. It was a good night while we were there though and it would appear from speaking to others that a good time was had by most.

Chris would appear to finally be getting on with his house buying. By the sound of it the people from whom he is buying after chasing him for progress for ages appear to have decided to delay a little and he's now hoping that it will all complete on Friday.

Only two more weeks to go until Em and I go off on our holidays. A Fortnight spent out in the bahamas. Crystal clear warm waters and lots of sharks there. Hopefully I'll have some memorable dives to put into my log."

"event","Ok, I'm home again from work and have a bit of free time and so though I'd do some updating.

Em came home at the weekend and all is going well. The house now has the requisite level of noise once more and my evenings don't seem to be quite as long. I've even finally finished watching the Blue Planet on DVD in the evenings.

In the rest of the world I've started playing some more WoW again and I've built and undercoated a couple more units for my Tomb Kings army. Jasper_the_cat's skaven will rue the day that they decided to cross the path of Tomb Prince 'insert witty name here.'
Tomorrow's role playing session should be a nice blood bath too. We're down one of our regular group who has been on a 4 week trip to africa (lucky bugger) and so we've been running a temporary group of characters just for fun. My Daemon Slayer and his rune axe managed to take down a giant last week in a single round of combat. I did something like 60+ points of damage to the bloke all to the legs. As this week is the final session I'm assuming that the orc warboss and his many minions will be thrown in against us though having 3 cart loads of gunpowder has made us all think of the old fate point issue. Do we blow the lot and rely on fate points to save us or should we just run in and chop the lot up?

Answers on a post card please to....."

"event","Oh well,

That's the end of the working week done. It's been a bit strange and the drive home was a bloody long one but it is finally over. I'm sitting here with poppy in my lap trying to inform me that it's his tea time and trying to think of something worthwhile to go in here.
After chatting with my brother and jasper_the_cat recently I've been persuaded to have a go at warhammer too. So far I have 10 skeletal archers painted up, though a shabby job by even my normally poor standard and a bunch more sitting here needing to be undercoated. The Tomb King army of 'insert witty name here' will be arising once more from the sands soon. Hopefully I'll be able to get a couple of 500 point games in so that I can actually learn how these rules actually work after years of preferring 40k instead.

On the plus side, tomorrow is Saturday and this will mean that my Lady Wife will finally be returning home after a week away on a client's holiday. For all i moan about her hogging the duvet at night and taking over all the bed I keep finding that I can't get and sleep when she's actually away and the house is way too quiet.

Cheers

Zeth"

I finally got around to signing up for this to see what all of the fuss is about. 
It would appear that quite a few people that I know are on here and updating regularly so I will no doubt be a bit of a dissapointment when my updates start to drop off and then cease altogether as time goes but.

Anyway until then on with the updating..."

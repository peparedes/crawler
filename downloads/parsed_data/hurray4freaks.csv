I think I will always use it. 
It's my actual journal.

Yesterday was my grandma's 81st birthday. My parents, Dennis and I went down there and brought her KFC (what she wanted, weird I know) and hung out. She sang some of her favorite songs that she sang to her kids when they were young and it was cute. We had fresh peach pie and gave her presents. It was nice and relaxing. Then Dennis and I had to drive to my boss' house because they went out of town for a concert and we were house-sitting. They are FINALLY making me a key since I house sit for them so much.

This last weekend was really nice.
Saturday was the fight and I finally got to see some girls my age.
Working at the Cabinet Corner has limited the amount and kind of people I interact with.
And waitressing in Cambria is usually for middle-age and older people.
Sunday Dennis and I went to the swap meets and I found super nice jewelry that I love ad a earring stand holder that I had to really barter for because they had it for their display earrings but I've been looking for one forever! It's really neat. Old wood. Handmade and antique. 

Our place looks really cute.
Although I want to move because we are still having problems with everything.
I can live there for another 6 months though so we'll see."

"event","Forth of July was lots of fun!
I would have won the hoola hoop contest but I wanted my man to get a prize... awwwww
Anyways
Drinking with the boss is quite fun.


Dennis took me to the melodrama, kaycking, miniature golf, and a seafood place.
At the seafood place we ordered a bucket of crab and they gave bibs and it was lots of fun.

Dennis and I sat next to a couple during dinner. They were super nice and gave us wine and stuff. I later asked her husband what they did for a living and he said that his wife is kind enough to let him live off her singing money. Yeah the lady next to me was Carlene Carter- The daughter of Joan Carter who was married to Johnny cash. She got mad at her husband and quickly changed the subject. Sure enough when I looked her up on the computer... it was her!
That was fun :)
She took a picture of dennis and I (before I knew who she was) and it turned out horrible. But I'll save it anyways :)

Work is good
I have my own clients and I designed their 3 bathrooms for them and yesterday they paid their deposit
:)
I'll be getting commission... hurray"

I got hired as full time as a kitchen designer

I decided that I only want to work here part time.

I wanted to note the fact that he has changed dramatically
He has always been a superb boyfriend... we just clashed in some areas.
But now... he somehow... changed, and  we don't clash at all?
It wasn't like he needed to change, it was just that our personality differences that got in the way sometimes.
Is changed possible?
It's so weird...
I have never felt this way before and I am so... Excited!

He told me that he is going to make this work no matter what, because I am all he ever wants and I am all he looks forward too.

I'm kind of freaked out about graduating and finding a job.
Kerri and I made a road trip down to SLO today because Cal Poly was having an Architecture Design Fair.
We dressed all spiffy and printed out our resumes.
We talked to lots of firms, and a lot had an interior design unit within their firm.
A few told me that they liked me and were interested. They took my resume and gave me their business cards and told me to call them. 
Kerri and I were the only designers there since Cal Poly does not offer an interior design degree.
Yes, we were sneaking into the Cal Poly fair, but we told the head people and they were okay with it :)"

I still have another year or two till I get my Master's
we'll see how it goes
At least I don't have to stay in Fresno because I can work on my thesis anywhere.
I'm pretty sure I finished all the master classes by the end of this semester
I'm glad I started this early while I'm still getting my lower degree.
It definitely saved me a year of school.

I can always go back to my intern place since they offered me a job.
I would like to move to a big city though.... Kerri and I... that would be perfect

I'm freaking out because I have to decide where I am going to move to for jobs.
LA, San Francisco.... Paso Robles? Why paso? well.... my boyfriend.
But I need to move to a big city for my dream job.

Can someone be sure that the person they are with is right for them?
Or are they just right for them at the time.
Could you convince yourself that the person is right for you?
People can be in love multiple times in their life... but when they tell the person they love... that they will ""love them forever"" is that true?
I used to think so
I don't like when Dennis says he will love me forever
is that weird?
Do I not trust love?
Do I not trust the person?
I don't think it's intended to mean ""forever"" because what happens if we break up.... will he still love me in 20 years? No. 10 years? No. 1 year? maybe...
What about the people who have loved me before... do they still love me? Nope
Is love that fickle? 
It's made me think of love totally differently
I used to be so sure about things 
and now... I just don't know
Is Dennis the man for me?
I have to start planning my future... out of school
do I consider him?
I think I should
but should I?
What happens if it doesn't work out and I just screwed myself on potential situations that could have had amazing outcomes.
What if I don't plan him in my life?
Then he could have been the man I spent the rest of my life with.
What if I give up my dreams for him?
Are my dreams more important than him?
If it was someone else... would I be more sure?
Why am I thinking like this? 
I'm scared."

"event","Dennis Birthday was yesterday
I have him a present for his car
it was freakin expensive but it was his Christmas present too

His brother and him both have the same birthday
they have a tradition where they BBQ on their birthday weekends each year
BBQ oysters
yup every year

They also had tri-tip and sausage
I made everything else
Salad, salsa, guacamole, hummus and bread/crackers, stuffed mushrooms and not to mention... DRINKS
yes, I was the bartender :)
it was a LOT of fun
he has never been so happy
he said it was his best birthday
that made me happy

I forgot to take pictures of the BBQ so this is all I have

I told him to LOVE the present


On his real birthday I took him out for breakfast
then we rented 5 movies
watched the movies and took a nap
went out to dinner
then we went for a bike ride at 11 at night
then we watched another movie 
haha
that's what he wanted to do!
I was hungover so I didn't complain :)"

Not really, but I've been having a fun end of summer!
The fair was fun with my boy
and I'm done with my intern job and they asked if I could work full time and they also gave me a very nice bonus the last day at work

Lots of drama with the waitressing job
Girls are lame
although I still like doing it
but it's getting stressful

Next weekend Dennis and I are moving my stuff back to Fresno
We are also house sitting my boss's super beautiful secluded house
they are leaving their bar open for us and they have a nice backyard with a hot tub
Party anyone? j/k

2 weeks till my brother is getting married
SCARY!
I'm so excited though!

Yesterday morning we went to the swap meet
Then Tom and Pricilla came over and Tom was trashed haha
Last night Dennis and I made a fabulous dinner
we should be professional chef's!
Cooking makes us closer

I'm sad to leave

He's been trying to be a sweet boyfriend
WE BBQ oysters on Tuesday
It was intense

I'm excited:)

On Sunday
We had VIP tickets to the Luguna Seca Races in Monterey Bay
The tickets included free food and alcohol and Awesome seats
they are only held once a year in the United States
It was crazy
(street bike races)
Michael Jordan and Brad Pitt were there but I didn't see them :(

I'm finally experiencing summer and it's making me happy.

I BOUGHT A BIKE
it's a red cruiser

Saturday we picked out a cat for my grandma and brought it to her on Sunday
I didn't tell her I was going to do that and she didn't want the cat
but of course, I annoyed her for hours and she gave in
She'll thank me in a few weeks :) after she gets over being upset

Last Saturday we went to the wine festival
it was a lot of fun
I drank A LOT

Today we went to the lake
I liked it
it was the first time I went out at lake Naciamento
It was like a total lake party with people in there boats
we kept on getting latched on to other boats to socialize
there were some pretty crazy drunk blondes that get showing their boobs, haha
I drank wine coolers and got super tired, so we went home

you're not suppose to say ""Yeah, that's horrible, I'd feel like crap too""
You ARE suppose to say ""It's no big deal, everything will be fine""
Seriously boy, it's not that hard

it's crazy

been staying up every night working on projects
I'm pretty scared about finishing everything but summer is after that!

I've been rejected by 10 interior design places, either in person or on the phone.
how lame
the economy is going down hill and no one is hiring 
also, 6 places I tried to go to in san luis has shut down permanently
I ran out of places to call and look, then out of the blue I looked in the phone book one more time and saw one I forgot to call

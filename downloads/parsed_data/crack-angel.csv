"event","Hmm...well..first of all...I would just like to apologize...'cause this won't be a very nice entry

On behalf of my bestfriend Emma and myself,
	WHAT'S UP?
	I don't know where to start...you don't email us...you don't let us know what's going on...what do you want us to do? beg you to talk to us...to explain your actions? 'Cause if u think we're going to do that...u're wrong.
	How could you go on like this...leaving Emma hanging like you're doing.  If you don't want to be with her..then you have to tell her straight up..if you've found someone else... then DON'T HIDE from us...TELL US.....not even us....tell EMMA.  Do you have any idea of what you're doing to her emotionally, mentally, and physically?  I've never seen her GIVE HER ALL to a guy as much as she did to u...and ofcourse she did because you are family....and I..me LORIE..said it would be all good...and she TRUSTED ME.  Since you left I've watched her stress over skool.  She made time for you...just to email...or call...even though she had a lot of work to do...and I know she had a lot of work...especially when her group was dumping their assignments on HER.  She was @ the burn out stage....because she PROMISED that she would WORK HARD to keep the relationship STRONG.  But a relationship can only work if BOTH SIDES WORK HARD.  What happened? 
	I've read your lj entries...for one thing...you HAVE THE TIME to write in your lj..but NO TIME to write to Emma...to me? What's up with that, huh? Like talk about stake through heart.  Your entries showed that nothing was wrong....but I'm smarter than that... is there SOMEONE ELSE? 'Cause if there is....and you don't have the balls to tell Emz or me... and u wanted us to find out some stupid way...then screw it <in my opinion>  I can't believe you JP....I don't even know who can get through to you anymore... I'm sorry it has to come from me..but I'm not sorry for what has to be said...you can't mess with people like this.  Hey..I could be wrong...and you COULD probably put me in my place.. and explain your actions....but it will take A LOT of explaining on your part to make things right.  But if you don't want to make things right...and just runaway from all of this..then that's fine.. u know... thanks for letting EMMA, IAN, and ME down.  Like I'm really hurt that you couldn't come talk to me if you had a problem...u know..I thought we were tighter than that... I invite you to my home..introduce you to my friends...my best friend.....and you totally flip on me. 'Cause u see....YOU hurting Emma...makes me feel like I hurt Emma too.  And I can't stop worrying about this whole situation 'cause I know how Emz is feeling..and I don't want her to hurt... I don't want her to feel like she's been played a FOOL.  

	So whatever breath of air you have to belt out an explanation..then it better come soon.. 'cause the more time goes by..the bigger the wound will grow..and the harder it will be to heal it.  If we don't hear anything..then your TRUE COLOURS will have been shown."

Well..why haven't u made your existence or interest shown to Emz.. or me..it's not like u to drop all communication.

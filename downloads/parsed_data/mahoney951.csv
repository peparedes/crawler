<h2>Virgo - Your Love Profile</h2>
<b>Your positive traits:</b>
<br><br>
You're incredibly thoughtful and able to give your partner what they need most.<br>
You are totally logical. You can deal with problems without involving your emotions.<br>
A good work ethic. You'll do whatever it takes (within reason) to make your relationship work.
<br><br>
<b>Your negative traits:</b>
<br><br>
Sometimes you are so focused on your goals that you let your relationships suffer<br>
You tend to be a perfectionist - and expect perfection from your mate as well<br>
You are picky. So picky that you rather be single than with someone who has a few minor faults.
<br><br>
<b>Your ideal partner:</b>
<br><br>
Values success in life as much as you do<br>
Fits a checklist of qualities you've been looking for since childhood<br>
Like you, is more practical and realistic than romantic
<br><br>
<b>Your dating style:</b>
<br><br>
Active. You're a bit hyper, so you'd prefer a date that involved rollerblading in the park or hiking.
<br><br>
<b>Your seduction style:</b>
<br><br>
You may seem a bit shy, but once you open up to someone - you're totally uninhibited<br>
You like to set the scene first - candles, music, nice sheets<br>
A bit obsessed with cleanliness, you may want to shower first with your love
<br><br>
<b>Tips for the future:</b>
<br><br>
Soften up a little. Vulnerability is sexy - and feels great over time.<br>
Lower your standards a little. Look past a messy desk or someone being five minutes late.<br>
Praise your partner more. You make expect them to be successful, but complements are still appreciated.
<br><br>
<b>Best place to meet someone online: </b>
<br><br>
<a href=""http://blogthings.com/eharmony.html"">eHarmony</a> - the best place to find other busy singles looking for a serious relationship
<br><br>
<b>Best color to attract mate:</b> Navy blue
<br><br>
<b>Best day for a date:</b> Wednesday

"event","I felt like the biggest slacker today.  Once agian I slept in really late.  I really need to get up early the next few days to get my body use to it... for when school starts next week.  I'm gonna be soo dead in class.. hehe. 
  I'm gonna stop calling eliot anymore.  Last night, when i called him for Jim about the logos.. that was really the last straw.  Just thr way colleen answeres the phone, and how eliot sounds so fake now... god. i hate it.  and no... i'm not jelious, not in the least bit. But, its not cool to treat me, of all poeple the way his does.  I mean, knowing el, he probably doesn't know hes doing it.  But, it still happens.  And i hate it.  I hate how he talks all fast on the phone and doesn't care about what I have to say.  I miss how he use to love every word that came out of my mouth...i miss how he actually use to listen.  No Matter how much it scares me to think of ""Eliot"" not being a part of ""chloe's"" life...  maybe it has to happen.  Went went from friends... lovers... best friend... enemys... friends... and now... i don't know what we are.  I need to stop associating him with the guy i use to know.. when he was ""mine"".  Cuz, obviously, hes not that same person anymore.  Witch is alright, but, the persons he's become isn't exactly someone i can get ""along"" with.  If I were to meet him for the first time, now... I wound't wanna be friends with him.  And, i think Peter and all them would agree.  The only things that tie anyone with him are the good old days of cyberschool, and ""chloe & eliot"".... those are over and gone now.  NOthing of that ""guy"" is in him anmore... so... goodbye  Eliot... *love you*..."

"event","I'm in ""one of those"" moods tonight.  Where I can think really clearly and write really meaningful lyrics.  I havn't been able to just sit down and have the words flow onto paper for a while...  Its pretty cool. Hopfully someday I'll end up making my lyrics into songs, but its a lot of work that takes up a lot of time.  I tried recording my song ""Breaking me Down""  the other day.  Supprisingly it came out pretty good. Although it sounds like i'm trying too hard to sound like Gwen Stefani or somehting silly like that...  :) 

    Tonight I'm gonna go onto collegeboard.com agian and look though all the colleges I'm deciding on.  So far, i really like on thats in PA..TX, and one in NC.  I dunno though.  Thats a long way form home. I know i shoudl take it one day at a time.  I ahve at least another 6 months before i need to be narrowing my choices down. And, what if in a year i decide that i don't need to go to a 4 year school? What if I'm in a serious relationship... what if i'm in a serious carrier... etc.  Ya know?  I'm only 17... and its a lot to be thinking about.  well.. later"

"event","I finially talked to eliot tonight.  I'm actually really glad, because I miss talking to him.  He got the video camera he wanted for X-mas, so thats cool... and a whole lotta DVD's :)  lucky him..  god...  i alwasy get all sentimental towards him at christmas time.  i don't try to do it on pourpose, but i think i alwasys will.  to a certian extent anyways.  maybe we we talked on a ""regular"" basis i woulnd't be like this.  I told him that after him and colleen got back together that we wouldn't talk very much.. but he insisteted that i was wrong... guess who ended up being right? hehe.. yeah.  I dunno if he does it on pourpose or not. probably not. and i'm not blaming colleen, cuz i think shes totally nice n' stuff.  I just miss talking and doing stuff with el.  pretty soon i'm gonna be moving out, getting a job.. etc, and i don't wanna loose him as a friend completely.. that scares me.  god.. now i'm going on and on about ""eliot stuff"" which no one cares to hear about..... hehe.  
  Christmas morning was alright.  Less than i expected it to be, but thats what happens when you get older.  
  I saw Lord of the Rings this morning with Pia and Ryan.  God... i've never been soo sleepy and board during a movie before! haha.  Maybe i'm just a complete dork, but i really didn't like the movie. i dunno... not my kinda thing i guess.

I got like 10 beanies too! I think i'm gonna collect them or something.

  So..  tonight i also went to westgate for ""christmas eve by candel light"" *which i attend every god damn year* haha.  I was being soo scarcastic durning the servics.. Pia kept telling me to be quite.. haha..
ONLY cuz westgate made it all such a joke.  They started off the night by singing some song that sounded like it could be the theme for the Lion King...  and then the man with the curley long blond hair sung the solo *and he reminds me of a lion cuz of his hair*.. so i'm all like ""K-passa Mu-fassa""? haha... funny.. anyhoo..

"event","Today started off slow... as did a majority of this week.  But, it was different because I tried to do some reflecting on stuff thats been going on laitly.  One thing I really need to work on is my grades...  This last quarter was a real disappointment to me...  I started off the year by thinking I was gonna do better than last year.. but once agian friends and my ""social life"" interfiered with it.  I can't let that happen anymore... its not good for me.  I think one of my New YEar's resolutions is going to be ""To stay focused on the things that really matter in life"".... :)

   Anyhoo... right now I'm working making Christmas presents...  
I went to ELiot's this morning to drop off his ""Get-Well-Basket""... I feel so bad for him cuz he's so sick.  It must really suck because its his break and so close to Christmas.  I wish I coulda talked to him more, but I had to go to the U to pick up my retainer with Pia.  

     Tonight at around 10 i'm gonna go see ""The Lord of the Rings"" with Sean, his brother and sister-in-law.  I'm excited cuz everyones been telling me what an incrediable movie it is.  (3 hours lonsg though!!!) .. hehe..  Bye bye.."

He called when he got over the border from Canada. Canada is pretty cool because they let you drink when your 19!!! (which is how old Sean is).. How lucky! hehe.. It sounds like he had a pretty good time snowboarding.  I can't WAIT till i get to go this season.  I have a good feeling I'm getting a new board for X-MAS, so theres something to look foward to :) hehe...  I hope I get a Microphone for my computer.  That way I can get that job form DigitalyImported.com, andddd I can make some new Demos.  Well... I ahve to call the ""Krew"" now.. hehe. *what silly boys*"

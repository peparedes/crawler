"event","In the deepest, darkest corners
he was a moment
a movement
from the edge of sight.
Silent
but smiling
and&nbsp;
even without seeing him
theres a feeling
he might be fun.
To taste the freedom
that life denies us.
To open my arms
to his sweet mystery
and never pause
or wonder.
Saying
'nevermore, and nevermore'
and laugh in his darkness
until the tears have dried.
Lost.
But lost in fire and laughter;
no more sadness.
Freedom to walk on
and dance in his shadows.


love and blessed be

"event","I can't help the feeling that something is about to happen.
But it hasnt presented itself yet.
Sometimes I sit quietly,
and just listen to the Universe,
to hear what is being said to&nbsp; me.
I'm cheerful and okay at the moment, if a little tired,
but the answers I get are strange, when I ask.

(after a restless night,
I woke to a song that described me completely, when I was young;
a sort of reassurance, altthough I know how completely those days are gone)

I meant to go for a swim, and a day out today,
but changed my mind at the last minute

Whats that about?

and I wonder;
who are you, Greta, and what are you?

"event","The Tale of Two Prawns.

Far away in the tropical waters of the Caribbean, two prawns were
swimming around in the sea
One called Justin and the other called Christian.

The prawns were constantly being harassed and threatened by sharks
that inhabited the area.
Finally one day Justin said to Christian, ""I'm fed up with being a
prawn; I wish I was a shark, and then I wouldn't have any worries about
being eaten.""

A large mysterious cod appeared and said, ""Your wish is granted""
Lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark.
Horrified, Christian immediately swam away, afraid of being eaten by
his old mate.

Time passed (as it does) and Justin found life as a shark boring and
lonely.
All his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them.
Justin didn't realize that his new menacing appearance was the cause
of his sad plight.

While swimming alone one day he saw the mysterious cod again and he
thought perhaps the mysterious fish could change him back into a
prawn.
He approached the cod and begged to be changed back, and, lo and
behold, he found himself turned back into a prawn.

With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes&nbsp; Justin swam back to his
friends and bought them all a cocktail.
(no, The punch line does not involve a prawn cocktail - it's much worse).

Looking around the gathering at the reef he realized he couldn't see
his old pal.
Where's Christian?"" he asked.
He's at home, still distraught that his best friend changed sides to
the enemy &amp; became a shark"", came the reply.

Eager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture,
he set off to Christian's abode.

As he opened the coral gate, memories came flooding back.
He banged on the door and shouted, ""It's me, Justin, your old friend,
come out and see me again.""
Christian replied, ""No way man, you'll eat me.&nbsp; You're now a shark,

When I heard (from our daughter) that you were finally dead, we all cheered.&nbsp; We were not ashamed of that, after the thirty years of horror you&nbsp;put us through.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because now I knew that I had out-lived you, and you could not after all make good your promise to kill me before you died.&nbsp; You were gone,&nbsp;we were free;&nbsp; no need to look over my shoulder any more.&nbsp; Now our scars could begin to heal, and turn&nbsp;from open wounds into a tough layer of protection. 

&nbsp;I'm afraid that our daughters scars may be even deeper than mine; she was an infant, when you were so violent, and you&nbsp; played cat and mouse with her emotions all her life. 

I didn't love you, I didn't even like you.&nbsp; I was heartbroken over someone else when you came into my life, and I found that you and my dad had announced and arranged our marriage in the pub.&nbsp; I was a sad, innocent young woman - and I couldn't find out how to escape it.

Goodbye, ex-husband.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
You were cruel and selfish, and like all others of your kind died alone and un-mourned. 
Our life goes on, and we celebrated your passing.

"event","Yesterday at Meeting (our last at Earls Colne, barring going back for visits) was beautiful and thought provoking.&nbsp; It was also our local ecumenical Sunday, so there were people from other local churches, and a very sociable atmosphere.&nbsp; (Even more than usual!&nbsp; Thats one of the things I love about Meeting;&nbsp; the cheerful&nbsp; sociable laughter and real friendliness after our silent hour)&nbsp; A little lady and I sang some methodist hymns, after Meeting (as best we could remember), because she had found an hour's silence/quaker ministry a bit too much.&nbsp; I was hugged by everyone at least once, and no&nbsp;end &nbsp;of handshakes and well-wishing.&nbsp; They're beautiful people and its a very beautiful, very old Meeting House, which carries the total calm of its usage even when Meeting is not in process. (Sometimes I've been to the art group there, among other things)

We spoke about the 'gathered silence', and what it means to us.&nbsp; It's nourishing;&nbsp; but I also&nbsp;think of this peaceful hour, listening to God, as practice and preparation for the final day that will come into all our lives, one day.&nbsp; Then, as the Universe pauses for a moment, we will more easily hear God;&nbsp; and walk cheerfully and peacefully on, without anger or regret, towards the Light.

I thought about the Meetings (York, Edinburgh, Bolton, Blackpool, Warrington, Preston, Lancaster, Brigflatts, Woodbrooke, Earls Colne, Sudbury, Colchester, Chelmsford)&nbsp; that I have known well over the last 36 years (and a couple of places, Findhorn, Pendle,&nbsp; Manjushri Priory, Winter Hill, Fylde Hospice, Longridge Fell, Sizergh, Coniston, Cat Bells, - which are not Quaker, but which I have also known and loved, and where peace and meditation are regular daily activities.)&nbsp; They all share&nbsp;this 'sense of silence', peacefulness, - Listening, - in common.&nbsp; I know now that the sadness and drought in my soul over the last few years has sprung from a dearth of time in these places&nbsp;&nbsp; and those like them, where its possible to feel connection to the beating heart of the universe.

I still have loads to do, before the weekend.&nbsp; And Stuart tells me that it may well be several months before we can get internet access organised at our new home in Nottingham.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Who knows?&nbsp; Creative is our middle&nbsp; name.)&nbsp; That much of my life is unsure.&nbsp; So I'll sign off now, but ask you all to keep me on your Friends List, because I shall be back, even if its in a few&nbsp; months time, to write about my new life as a warden in the city.

My early morning walks will always continue, perhaps also early morning swimming. &nbsp;I have a great many targets to meet, as the job takes shape beneath me.&nbsp; But I also have a couple of real privileges.&nbsp; The beautiful garden with its elderly trees and shady corners, is right there - and I have no problem keeping sharing it with the public and working to keeping it healthy.&nbsp; The Meeting Room, which of course is one of the areas that I shall keep clean daily, is also there, whenever I need a few moments silence myself.&nbsp; Wooden floors and high vaulted (new) roof.&nbsp; One large wall, all glass, looking out into the greenery.
And a wonderful, friendly old city awaits me, with galleries, history and theatre.

Truly blessed, as Rick Wakeman would say.

Take care,
and as soon as I can, I'll be back.

love you
blessed be

"event","I do have the most amazing and wonderful family. 

Stuart announced that we were going to see my mum last Friday, 
and off we went to Blackpool (five hour drive). 
We arrived at 9.30 
At eleven, they suddenly decided that it was time we all went to bed. 
Okay. 
I was tired, but as I fell asleep, I could hear my mum talking 
(to the cat, I supposed. Or herself. Or perhaps the TV. 
Or perhaps it wasn't her, but the people in the flat next door...) 
When I got up in the morning, she was already up. 
'Just come through here' she said 'I've got something to show you' 
- and there was my daughter Laura sitting up in bed, grinning at me! 

I guess my face was a picture. 
They'd known she was coming, and wanted to surprise me, 
so they made sure I was in bed, when she arrived. 
(Of course my mum didn't manage to to whisper when she arrived, so I'd heard her, 
although Laura had let herself into the flat very quietly) 

But - better and better. 
This was Laura's birthday present to me for next Friday; 
a whole day of rides on the Pleasure Beach. 
Oh, man... 

Stuart took us down there so that we were there before the gates opened, 
and I can only summarise. We hit all the white knuckle rides with a vengeance. Hardcore. 
All my favourites, plus more, and especially two new ones which I would recommend to anyone heading that way (Bling and Infusion). 
What a day. We ignored the 'do not ride if you have a heart condition' signs and got on with it. As far as I know, the Rides are pretty damn good for your cardiovasculars, and it is really unlikely that you actually drop dead in the short time that you're actually riding. 

If you know me, you'll know that the Mouse has long been my addiction (since I was 9, in fact), and of course, I love Avalanche (smooth, easy ride, like flying), the Big One (lorra lorra laughs) and Revolution (oops! backwards! - theres always someone behind you who thinks its time to get off halfway through, but finds they can't) 

But - 
Bling (down by the south entrance) - oh, what can I say? - 
the perfect way to start anybody's Saturday morning 
and Infusion (oh my god) - simply excellent - I never thought that anything would go so instantly to the top of my List. All I can say is - go on it. It's worth the journey, and worth the queue. 
Even better than the Mouse. 

You will need something afterwards 
(in my case, prawns) 

I love the view of my home from various high points around the Beach, just before we all start to scream as we go into the big drops. 
You can't beat it. 
I love the challenge of not getting damaged as the Rides swoop you up and back and round and over. And again. And again. 
I love Blackpool. 

I have no idea why anyone could say 
'I don't think Blackpool has much to recommend it' 
but plenty of folk know otherwise. 
It's the best therapy - 
a total re-chanelling of all the energies that might be causing trouble anywhere else, and everyone laughing together, in the queues and the park. Long may it grow. Live long and prosper. 

Laura, you are brilliant. 
Thank you for the most wonderful, amazing gift that anyone could give. 

love and blessed be

"event","September is probably my favourite month.
I tend to start new things in the autumn
(habit of a lifetime)
and this year, after so much to think about,
is no exception.

My friend Paul N tells me about living in the here-and-now
and I find I haven't been doing that;
but I'm really going to work at it, now.
The world is mad at a personal and international level
and I'm going to tackle my own patch.

We are here, we are now.
Thank god for that.

-Don't believe me? - try this -
I've clung to a love affair with a place for years.
But it's not shared by my man.
I've decided to let it go,
and live here,
where we can both be happy
(not just one of us)

How do you like them apples?

love and blessed be

"event","is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
she is my sister and my best friend.
words can not describe how much i love that girl.
we have gone through everything and i mean everything together.
and i know she is always there for me.
and im always there for her.
this is not somekind of little ""your my friend one day not my friend the other""
we will always be bffs.
and if you doubt us i hate you.
she is my role model.
and i dont know why im hers but i am.
she is hotter than the sun.
and dhe knows it.
she will always be my number one on my top 8.
she is a sexy sex monster.
i would die for her and she would die for me.
we love eachother more than any one.
and we will love eachother even more than our husbands or even our own kids.
its crazzzzy love.
its unconditional.
our love is HUGE.
we sleep in the same bed.
but we dont do ANYHING.
that would be gross.
she is my life.
i would kill myself with out her."

"event","he was the best grandpa EVURRRRR.
i miss him so much.
it doesnt feel like it really happend yet.
i still cant beleive it.
i mean my grandparents cant die.
they have to be there for your wedding and when you graduate highschool.
i know that im thankfull for the time i had with him.
atleast im not a baby and wont have any memories of him.
he was one of the most wonderfull people to ever walk the earth.
and i would give anything to listen to him read poetry one more time.
i wish i could have been there.
and i want to see my family right now.

but nobody can pay for the plane tickets because they are all paying for the creamation.
and everything sucks right nowwww.

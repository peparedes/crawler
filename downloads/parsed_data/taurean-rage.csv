there's brooke... <i>""I enjoy solitude, and long walks on the beach as long as people are being eaten by sharks nearby.""</i> it sucks to forget that you miss someone but still neat when you remember. i hope her and her health are doing good.

erin, who sent me some new-fangled nudge, still seems to be interested in my life. kind of sweet and unusual, but i've always known her to have a ton of friends.

then there's white mario and i think i saw nina somewhere back there. she's in prague? never saw that coming but, at the same time, not too surprised.

wish i had enough time or interest to hang out with some of you or at least do entries. well, i'll do one later if it comes to mind."

i saw that and decided i had to make a post for it. but in order to make it seem like that wasn't the primary reason for this, here's some more stuff.

monique's birthday party is on saturday. i hope everything goes okay. then there's bug-o-rama on sunday and sac raceway, but i'm afraid i'll wake up too late and be too hungover to make it. we'll see.

school is good but really slow and boring. time to go to work now."

"event","it sucks that my return to livejournal is sparked by the way-premature death of nina's big, gorgeous, shiny black cat, Jonas. i spent a fair amount of time with him during his kittenhood but only saw him a couple times as an adult which makes his death seem that much more untimely. to me, he had a commanding aura. he seemed somehow powerful. my sincere condolence to her.

i rarely talk to nina anymore so i appreciate that she considered to inform me of the news. i thought i would check her lj for more information and found out she got a new account. then i poked around my friends page and user info and was happy to see i've retained almost all my friends... at least all the ones that mattered. i may have to update some stuff after this.

i also noticed that brooke is still being overwhelmed with school and dealing with strange jerks on an everyday basis but still prevailing with immense spirit. all while being the same old journal whore i've known her to be. you, mario, and i should go to a nice, small hardcore show again.

at second look, a few of my friends' journals seem to be pretty dead. what losers.

i took my <i>first</i> college class last semester and passed with a 99.13%. the teacher loved me (in a guy way... straight, that is). so i may just be on to something with this school stuff and might even up the ante to two classes this fall.

monique and i are doing great. it's more apparent everyday that i'm going to have to fork over the money for a ring someday. i don't mind that. i mind any public dancing and conversing i'll have to do with awkward and rarely-seen relatives. that sort of anxiety kills me.

oh, i'm 25 now everyone. don't worry, i don't care."

what's weird was nina's entry was about a dream, too. i didn't make that connection until now.

the night before i dreamt of a weird amusement park that existed in the canopy of some dense jungle. there was this long tube that i was sliding through super fucking fast among the trees. there was a group of girls behind me that were all too prissy to go on it. i was all hyped up from the ride that when i got off at the end and saw them walking up on the walkway, i flipped em off and told them they sucked. oh, and this was all at night with no outside lights.

sometime last week i had a realistic dream about 4 or 5 rather large spiders. at the end, my psyche decided to throw in a big, black and red, shiny scorpion."

nice of the weekend to arrive. and even though it's three days, it's actually going to feel shorter than a normal weekend due to me helping brooke move to SJ. mario told me she wanted us up at 9am tomorrow for some godawful reason. i said no. we can't move into her new place until sunday so i don't see what the point of waking up so damn early to load a truck and have it sit in front of her current house all day. if i have to get up early just to fetch the truck by a certain time, that's okay. no reason to drag mario out of bed and i'll just go home and back to sleep after. we can load it in the afternoon/evening. sun's up til 8 anyway. hopefully she'll read this and call the house tonight. or, if i win, just wait til tomorow afternoon to make contact.

i made a new icon from the <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/users/comic_getfuzzy/134825.html target=_blank>latest get fuzzy strip</a>. i want to try circulating my icons regularly like most everyone else does. it's an opportunity to express myself. yeah.

haven't posted in a while. umm. jury duty was awesome. i went for 4 hours the first day where i ended up in a courtroom and they started going through jurors. went back for one hour the next day where they finished the process up and let everyone left go home. so i got both days off work, <i>paid for</i>, and spent time with monique. went back to work friday which, being a friday, was pretty relaxed. good week.

this weekend i... went to jc penney for an overpriced haircut and some good, cheap shirts. washed my car and dried with a towel that must've been dirty. my mom and her fiance dropped by sunday and we ate lunch. she met monique, which i guess is a big deal to some people, but whatever. of course they liked each other.

now i go to work. today is monique's first day back at childtime and she just called and it seems to be going good, albeit tiring. tomorrow's a half day for me for alisha's birthday dinner. that's all for now.

"event","so, i know everyone's wondering how i took those recent pics of maddy when my camera's been missing. well, there was a get together at <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=stephiecake target=_blank>steph</a>'s on sat night and it was my first time there since the bbq, which was hte last place it was seen at. so i took the liberty of searching myself and finally found it stuffed way down into the bowels of her couch. i'm so happy.

mostly because i have two concerts this week. <a href=http://purchase.tickets.com/buy/TicketPurchase?agency=TDC&pid=5324414 target=_blank>muse</a> tomorrow night and andrew motherfuckin w.k. thursday. if i didn't get pics of the latter, i would slice my wrists.

finding a home for maddy sucks. i got a few people who seriously want her, but it's hard to pick the right one. i can't ask, ""on a scale of 1 to 10, how much will you love her?"" so i have to somehow decide based on simple questions about whether they've raised a kitten before, what other animals they have, and other junk. and it's harder to decide on one person knwoing that i'll have to inform the other half dozen that i found a home for her and it won't be theirs.

<a href=http://www.hehehell.com/wodie/skates.gif target=_blank>this</a> disturbs me slighty. the only reason i can think of is because mario's going to show david and he's likely going to eat it up. i'll hear him use ""lollerskates"" for at least two weeks.

right now i feel my allergies affecting me more than my sickness, so i'm going to take an allegra, go to sleep, and hope for the best when i wake up. goodnight."

friday morning she was sleeping on my lap and i had to get up to get ready for work so i put her on my bed and went to brush my teeth. she didn't want to be up there so she jumped off and yelled out as soon as she hit the floor. she's jumped down from my bed dozens of times before, but she was groggy this time and landed wrong. i gave her two minutes to walk it off in case it was a simple sprain, but it didn't get any better and already started to swell. i called in late to work and took her to the vet where i left her for xrays. called vet later from work and she told me it looked like a hairline fracture on her growth plate (part of the bone that grows) and a week-long splint should be enough. they keep her overnight since i wasn't able to pick her up before they closed and since she doesn't need to be running around so soon anyway. pick her up the next morning with monique and she picked up the $180 bill since my finances are a joke right now. thank you, babe. i owe you.

oh, and i'm still sick."

"event","maddy didn't run out from under the bed when i walked in, nor did she run out from david's room. i broke out my flashlight and made my clicky noises, but nothing. i noticed she was clean out of food so i made some more and would look for her after. i put her bowl back in her eating spot in my room, continued to look for her, and not even a minute later, fucking sammy walks out my room licking his lips. i find her bowl and it's totally empty. i let him smell the bowl and proceeded to <i>beat the little fucker's ass</i>. now i'm panicking, thinking he ate all her food 10 minutes after i left for work some 16 hours earlier and she's gone hungry ever since. that she's curled up somewhere starved to death or near it. the last place i wanted to check was david/serena's room since they're sleeping, but i finally had to wake them up. david muttered out places to look for her and i finally found her behind their couch, curled up. i felt relief, bet even moreso once i reached for her and she looked up at me. i took her to her bowl and she ate half the damn thing right there. i feel terrible."

"event","<b>Taurus & Virgo</b>
 
<i>Two Earth-ruled signs which value tranquillity and discretion, they have all the ingredients for a harmonious love affair. Anxious Virgo finds reassurance in the stolid Bull, whereas the Taurean derives needed peace and energy from the Virgoan. A caress, a gaze, a gesture: each is worth a thousand words, when it comes to expressing the tenderness that binds them together. Taurus dominates, to the delight of clinging vine Virgo. ""The power of harmony, and the deep power of joy...""</i>"

even though it looks like she's taking a swing, she's not. ilike to pretend she did, though.

i'm so sleepy it hurts. i slept like hell until i got up at 6 nd showered and ate. and went back to bed at, like, 8. then had to wake up early to take miss thing to the vet. she goes back in two weeks for her first shots."

"event","i'm so hapy and shit. i don't know if it's the wine or <i>whatever else</i>. we had a wonmderful little bbqq tonight with some close folks and had a good time. hod a pleasantly surprising and all-too-relieving (read: bitchin) chat. brooke came and gave me my super camera and scoped out my punkcore kitty. why do girls want to stewal her? girls are selfish, backstabbing vengeful reatures. but that's a gross generalization. some are nice.

befoe all that i installed my perfect old pioneer cd deck in my jettaz0rz. it sounds a lot better, but the annoying bose amp is still the weak point. it'll tkae some money and a good solid day or two to make everyhing how i want it. then i will play hte loudest starting line song ever in a car! awesome. nerd.

my mom;'s getting married july 2nd and said i could bring afriend. it's just at her little house in boulder creek with some friends and family. she advertised free beer, but i'm not gonna drink in front of my aun and grandma tha i hardly ever see. lol. that'd be odd. yes,. lol.
 
thanks to david's gf, serena, for helping me cut off kitties dingleberries while i was drunk. i'm gona go to sleep before maddy wakesd up and my buzz wears off."

mario and i watched texas chainsaw massacre remake at stephanie's last night. it was more gross than anything. it ended up being a comedy, nonetheless.

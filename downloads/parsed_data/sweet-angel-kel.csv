I could be somebody on AIM who hates me. Well, I'm pretty curious, so yeah. I don't really find it insulting as I do amusing.

Well, I went to Noah's Ark today and it was SO MUCH FUN. But I'm burnt to a crisp, despite reappyling sunblock every fifteen minutes. So yeah."

Yesterday someone called me a 'stupid bitch' on one of my LJ posts. They didn't spell 'damn' correctly. I found it amusing, actually. XD

So yeah. Going to my geek job at the library tomorrow, staying as long as possible, then I'll probably call Sara.

But alchoholism is an illness. She can't help it anymore. She doesn't have anything that motivates her to stop. 

So, yeah. I might possibly have internet access, just not AIM. So, if you wanna talk, comment on here and I'll give you my e-mail addy. 

It's gonna be a loooooooong three days."

So they're operating tomorrow. She doesn't look very good. Since I went to the hospital today, I'm not going tomorrow. It's been a looooong day, and I'm really, really worried, but I can't do the hospital thing again tomorrow. I feel bad for not going, but :/

And then we get home, and Gramps left this hugeass message on our answering machine. Apparently my other Aunt, Tammy, is in the hospital because of seizures. Aunt Tammy is drinking herself into the grave, though. So she goes into the hospital every other month. She's making Gramps age so much, though. He's so worried.
My mom and I were giddy-happy later when we got home because we were crying and stuff all day. And we were talking.
Mom: Well, things always seem to happen in 'threes'...
Me: You'll jinx it! SHUT UP!!@#%

So we spazzed over that for a while, then I went online, and now I'm typing this. So yeah."

I gt in the car and the first thing I see is...a turtle?!@ Wtf was she doing with a turtle?!@$ Well, apparently she found it on the road and swerved to avoid it. It was a pretty male painted one, too. So first we went down to the river (in our flouncy skirts XD we must've looked like idiots) to put Mr. Turtle back in his natural habitat (he seemed very happy) and then we went to Teen Night. Well, we played pinball, confessed to each other that we sucked at pool, and played this shooting game. I lost, but my aiminy was more accurate. X3! Then we tried dancing and apparently I glowed under the blacklight. Oops. Well, we got non-alchoholic strawberry margaritas (mmmm :9) and went to play this game thing in the corner. It was fun and we got high scores and stuff. Eventually we danced some more. 

The bad parts: These asshole guys came up and started dancing (like, grinding) next to us. Sara and I have a name for it: Dance rape. >.>;

<P>And it's weird, because Anna just started talking to me again. She's a 'popular' kid, and I went with her, basically on a covert mission, until I could find what was making her all friendly towards me. Well, there isn't anything attached. From what I know, she's just trying to be my friend and fit me in.

But today was the last day of driver's ed. for the week. I talked to my brother on the phone, and he helped me soooo much. He gave me great advice and assurance. I'm just crying a lot today, for no particular reason. It sucks.

Well, my mom's almost done painting the living room. The whole house smells like fresh paint. Ew.

I need to draw something, but I'm not sure what. I also want to roleplayyyyy. :x

Sara and Danielle might come over later. Which is good, because it will take my mind off of driving. Actually, I might just ask my dad if he'll take me out for, like, 10 minutes to drive around. I need to get this stuff in my head."

Then we went back and talked to my relatives that were there, and Sara went with us to a garage sale (there were some interesting magnets there) and another EAA chapter, where I had lunch, and there was an air show. 

Well, we could only stand sitting watching these airplanes for so long, so we went home, Sara got her car, and she and I went to Family Video to rent movies. I'm kind of a closet movie geek. XD So then Sara's mom meets us there (o.o;) and we go to Markmans because they're having a closeout sale. There was this really pretty dress, but it didn't fit right on me. :< But I did get a shirt that Sara picked out for me. 

So we get home and start Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. Wow, was that dumb. XD It was funny but embarrassing, so we turned it off and put Patch Adams in after dinner. OMFG, great movie. We watched The Calling, too. That movie's really good! And them we watched TV until eleven, when Sara had to go home, and I went to bed.

Sara is a BLONDE. Well, Strawberry blonde, actually, but still. 

And it looks GOOD on her! Too bad she only bleached her once brown hair so she can dye it purple later. XD

But yeah. So then we took a mini road trip around town to try and find Katrina, so Sara could show her the new hair color. We never did find her.

Sunday: Had Sara and Danielle over. Played Melee and stuff. It was fun, as usual. Nothing special. 

Monday (today): Cleaned out my closet. I found stuff I didn't even know I HAD in there. It was horrible. Memories from childhood that I had to pack away (like my American Girl dolls -sniff-) to make room for new stuff. Plus, I had to throw stuff all over my room in order to make room. I felt almost claustrophobic. I can't STAND messes. Oh, it was so incredibly terrible. But my mom pushed me to keep going, so I did. Well, I climbed up on a chair to get to the top of my shelves in there, and hit my head. So I'm crying and laughing at the same time, and then I hit my head AGAIN. Oh my GOD. I think I was about to burst with emotions then XD But I finally got it finished and stuff. So yeah."

<P>Thursday: Nothing, really. Band, then sat on the computer until 6:00, when Megs came over. We talked about Erik. I think I might have cried a little. I was a tad depressed the rest of the night. We didn't fight. I'm glad she's there for me, but...yeah.</P>
<P>Friday: OMG HECTIC. I went to Driver's Ed. I sat on a plastic stool in the commons for 4 HOURS. My God, did the bone in my butt hurt after that. x.o; Ow. Then marching practice! That helped. Sara and I made up, and I came over to her house for a bit. I was just randomly depressed that day, but Danielle cheered me up. Then, after Melee, we went to the rodeo! :B And I got a cowboy hat. Because I'm a dork. Plus, I seem to end up going every year anyway and I felt out of place. XD </P>
<P>Saturday(today): I'm so tired. Marching really takes a lot out of you. Stupid 3-mile march. x.o; Then Erik, Meg, Ashley, Sara and I went to the gas station and Erik got us juice and water and stuff. The conversation we had was kind of funny.</P>
<P>Me:I don't have any money. Erik:I'll pay. Me:You sure? Erik:Yes. Me:But then I'll feel guilty! Erik:Don't feel guilty, just buy me a soda later!</P>
<P>And then I sat and watched the parade with Sara, and then I went to Bud's house for out usual family gathering and stuff. I must have smelled wonderful. XD Mmm, dried-sweaty band geek. I packed up my flute, ate, and watched TV with Katrina for a looong time, then we walked home. And then I took a much-needed shower. XD</P>

"event","Well, I raked grass and weeds, and my parents trimmed bushes. OMG, on this one bush, there was a vine and it was plotting world domination, I swear! It was huge! Once my parents wrestled it out of the ground, I tried to pick the thing up to put it in the pit. Well, this is no ordinary, run-of-the-mill vine This vine was probably 3 times my size. We're talking about a 15 or so foot vine. XD So eventually I give up and drag it to the pit. X3

So yeah. That's been my day so far. But still. Mastermind vines! Aahhhh!

Well, today I had fun. Amy and Marty came over to Lolo's and we swam, then Amy went home and we watched a movie. Peter made a couple of (annoying) phone calls, and from what I heard, David wanted to come but went with his dad to a movie instead.

Now for a recap of what happened during the week.

Saturday:
Went to my brother's house to babysit my niece, Alex, and nephew, Riley. Alex is a year old, and Riley is almost three. They're so cute! You can't understand what they're saying most of the time, and Alex should start speaking words soon. Right now it's just baby babble, but she'll get there. 

Sunday:
Went to Wal-Mart and got stuff, then came home and I frantically tried to get on the internet. I failed miserably. XD

Monday (today!):
Eh, went to Wal-Mart again and got food. I'm going back to Chicago tomorrow, so if I'm not on, that's why. I'm anxiously awaiting his answer...if he ever comes on. x.o;"

Well, I'll give him 'till Sunday to respond to me. If he doesn't I'll ask him (probably through someone) what his answer is. 

Gah. The anticipation sucks. Chances are I asked too soo and he'll say no. Hahaha, I probably couldn't have timed this any worse, actually. Then again, it won't be the first time a guy said no to that question, and it won't be nearly as bad as my last let-down, so I shoudln't be too shocked.

And that's always a plus right there. Let's see. I got there and followed Sara around for a bit, ate a snack with her, then we went back to the 'homeroom', this huuuge gym where many a band/choir nerd was camped out, playing/singing, listening to music, or sleeping. Sara and I decided to play cards for a while. Egyptian Rattail is a fun game. X3 It's really long, though. Then she went to change for her Broadway solo and I waited. And waited. AND WAITED. I went to go look for her and we ran into each other and I halped her practice and stuff. After I watched her broadway solo, Dawn's broadway solo, and Sara's regular solo, I was ready for FOOD. So I went outside where they were cooking stuff on a grill in my big red comfy sweatshirt and teeny skirt XD and waited in a HUGE line. Well, when I was about halfway through the line, Dawn and her mom saw me and she ran over to me and stuff and eventually she was all ""Can I cut in line? Will anyone mind?"" and I let her because I'm nice :3 So we talked, and I held my skirt so it didn't fly up because of the wind and stuff, and we got food and went inside to sit down by Katrina, her mom and dad, Mrs. Suehs, and her daughter. We talked about lots of stuff. It was fun. And then polka band did alright...we got a second place, but oh well. </P>

But in order to actually compete for prizes, you had to have TWO poems, not one. I had one. I don't write a lot of poetry. So they let me read my poem 'to warm the judges up', which is fine. i just wanted people to hear my poem, not to win prizes. I got a good score, too!

She has the -perfect- example of a boyfriend, another really good guy friend (she's gonna break perfect boyfriend's heart if he ever finds out she likes her guy friend) and all kinds of other friends. She's outgoing and stuff, too. Not to mention she's got a great voice and can act really well. And che can do really good crafts. And is pretty.</P>

<P>Me, I'm the total opposite. I have enough (girl) friends. And Sara is the best friend I could ask for. But guy friends? Pfft. Guys like to either pretend I don't exist, make comments at me, and sometimes tease me. I'm not sure why. I have 3 crushes. The strongest is on Travis. He's a junior, but guess what? Oh, look, he doesn't notice that I exist anymore after the play. Ric is my 2nd strongest. He's really, -really- cute and stuff, a little arrogant, but hey, so am I. (He also pays no attention to me.) The 3rd is on David, who is a year younger than me, a bit of an airhead, and lives in another freakin' state. And I have no idea how to approach ANY OF THEM (except David, no prob there except of the fact we live in dif. states.) All my guy friends are in Illinois. Another best friend (and fave cousin) is in Illinois. </P>

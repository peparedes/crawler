It was funny and had a lot of jokes from really old movies, or r movies. in one part, alext he lion is sitting on the island with help written behind him, then the part of p falls and it says hell. this one lady screamed/laughed. then in one part, alex is laying down, then staeks are falling from the sky. that's from american beauty, where the girl is bathing in rose pettles, and they're falling from the sky. I won't give away the whol movie, so bye! Got to go play violin.
P.S. I am so tired. My head hurts bad. I think i have a migrane. Maybe i have allergies....."

"event","echh...I didn't go to school today, which is good, but i'm sick. I have a high fever, and i feel like i'm gonna throw up! BLAH! I went to sleep at 10 last night. I mean, i was asleep. I'm usually still awake at that time, though. Then i woke up at 12, and hung out w/ my dad for a few minutes. Then, i went to sleep, and woke up at 2, and i thought that everyone was asleep, but my mom was watching ""angels in america"" and for once, she wasn't crying. ;) that's a really rare thing! any who... I'm supposed to go to my friend's house on thursday to sleep over, so i hope i'm betterer by tomorrow! On friday, we're gonna go to our old school for a purim celebration, and then back to her house for a sixth grade re4union. Everyone from sixth grade is gonna be there! PEACE OUT!"

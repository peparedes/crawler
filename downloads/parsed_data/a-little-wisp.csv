"event","I laughed so hard I was clutching my sides last night.

So on my forums it came to the attention of one of my friends that I had never received a love letter. *Gasp*

He wanted to amend that, right away. Thus began our love letter battle:

<i>Without further ado:

My dearest Haleigh,
You, my love, are the only one who moves me. You wake me in the morning, you kiss me goodnight. You are the light that shines in my path. Your words are beautiful- near as beautiful as your face. Oh, your eyes! Those deep green eyes. I feel as if I could swim away in them. I lose myself whenever I gaze at you. All of the world drifts away. The moon will not shine, the sun will not rise, the clouds will not rain, the earth itself will not move, without you by my side. My love is a river, flowing like my fingers through your hair. If every drop of rain, were an ounce of love I had for you, you would be washed away by an endless flood of affection. When you are cold, I will be your blanket. When you are warm, I am the cool breeze. You are the one and only token of my eye. You alone are the seven wonders of my world: your voice, your laugh, your eyes, your smile, your kiss, your touch, and your love. I am an unstoppable force, and you are an unbreakable wall. You complete me. For what is the rain, without two lovers, lips locked?

Love,
Kevin



This written with as much love as possible to a woman I have never met, seen, or talked to other than on this site.
No I am not stalking her. </i>


My reply: 

ALRIGHT ALRIGHT. This is going to be a duel, is it?

(Kevin, I am torn between laughing my ass off and marrying you right away.) What's a love letter without a love response?

*cracks knuckles*


Kevin, dearest of my heart, body, and soul -

I thought, ""Could these words be real?"" How could I mean so much to such a man? How can you possibly trust me, who wanders into love like a nocturnal creature, blinded and bedazzled, into daylight, unsure of this new, different, brighter, more beautiful world? How is it that you are so poetic, so calm when the love I have for you rages like a tempest within me, a hurricane of emotions I cannot settle for even one moment to return in fairness to you what you have given to me in such eloquence? Is this madness? This glowing warmth that starts in my fingers, tingling in my joints, crawling into my stomach, twisting, tightening, until suddenly, inexplicable and illogically, I'm soaring -

You're my arthritis - no, hear me out. You're my heartburn. You're the lesson that I never learned that nags at me inside my mind - you're the dream I can't grow out of, you're the dream I'm growing into. You're my wings, you're my rock, you shake the logos from my life, and can't you tell?

You're a sickness.

Because around you, without reason, I can't stop this inner shaking, this earthquake that rips the solid foundations of my life, my reason, my philosophies, out from beneath me. I've never felt like the skin may melt right off my bones, and I've never felt like I'm not in control. And if you continue, if you're being true, I might bolt -

What's more terrifying -

I might want to stay here, to give to you, with trembling hands, a hopeful heart - the heart I've never given to anyone before.

Either way,
Either way -

If you could get beneath my skin you'd know how much I shiver and shake, how much I shudder and quake - if you could see through my eyes, you'd have an idea as to what you are, as to what you do to me.

You steal time from me, for every second of the day there is no thought that you are not apart of. And the dreams I once dreamt, all for myself? They're all yours now. And for a person who needs them like I do, well... it just goes to show, doesn't it?

It just goes to show that -
Without cheapening the words,
For we two, I believe, can make them priceless -

I love you,

Haleigh"

"event","Sorry to those that I didn't get to see in Myrtle Beach. ;_; I got to spend like, a day there at most, and barely even got to see the beach. I had to wash a shit load of laundry too, so I felt partly confined to my house, which wasn't entirely bad. It was a relaxing... day and a half. I will be making another trip, I just have to carefully ponder the reason. 

So I spent all night playing Counterstrike, and I... well, I kind of suck. But. It's fun, at the same time, because when I do have kills, I feel like the shit, and the guys get all excited. I'm going to practice more, because Saturday night CS games sound like a lot of fun! I need a regular thing like this, something I can look forward to after work. And, I get to talk to my brother and the guys back in Augusta - it's neat!

So, two funny work stories.

The chair of the English Department came in tonight with his wife. 
Backstory: Desperately in need of a paperclip, and find his to be the only office door open at that moment, I went into his office and asked to borrow a paperclip. I told him I wasn't crazy, just desperate. He chortled to himself, admitted he was crazy too, and gave me a paperclip.

I told that I'd promise I'd return one to him. He told me not to worry, but paperclips are valuable commodities when you're an english major. 

I wasn't his waitress tonight, but he was RIGHT by my other table, so I finally got the guts to introduce myself properly to him.

And so I reminded him.

""I'm the girl that borrowed the paperclip that one time? I promised I'd return it. I still mean to keep that promise.""

By this time, he and his wife were laughing.

He seemed flabbergasted. ""Quite honestly, I had forgotten until you reminded me just now!"" 

So I grinned and said goodbye, and then Curtis, after I told him the whole story, told me that the professor is actually a very hard-to-please customer, and that he complains about everything. Then Curtis let me have a paperclip to give to him.

When the professor was taking out his cash, I walked over to his table and slid the paperclip at him, and his wife was laughing hysterically, and he even was chortling again. I told him to have a wonderful evening.

AND THAT is how you un-grouch a customer.

Story 2.)

I was about to leave when a couple sat down in my section. The woman asked if she could have the bread before the meal. In a rush, I blurted, ""Do you want jelly and whatnots?"" 

And she laughs and says, ""I love whatnots."" 

 And I was like ""... I have the worst vocabulary ever.""

A few minutes later, I came back with her bread and jellies and, setting the plate down, said: ""Here's your bread and a medley of packaged preserves!""

She and her husband ROARED with laughter. 

 And when they got their food, I came back over to check up on them and inquired: ""Are the flavors of your heavy rations dancing vicariously across your oral pallet?""

 The husband was red in the face from laughing.

At the end of their meal, I come over, and he then asks:
""Would you happen to have a petit transportable container for edible goods?"" 

And I was wheeezing. 
So I brought it out and said: ""Here's your glossy victual receptacle.""

We were clapping each other on the back while he left. 

And they were VERY nice. :D 

The end!"

"event","So, day's recap before I hit the sack (at 5:00 am... to wake up in six hours, clean my room, shove my shit into a car, and drive to Myrtle Beach? Holy ceiling cat, I do not prepare for ANYTHING). 

A.) Karen's FUCKING ENGAGED. Congrats, my darling! I had always hoped leaving my bra on your pillow would get us somewhere, but ... we can't win them all! 

B.) Work was great!

C.) Work was shit.

Let's go back to B. So I get there at two, pumped and ready to make money. I started off on a roll. I mean. Sunday/Church+Cracker Barrel = Tipsomgomgomg. 

And, you get those awkward moments when people ask, ""So, dear, would like us to add anything into our prayers before we begin?""

And then I have to pull some shit out of my ass like, ""... I hope my brother does well this semester!"" Or, ""I hope my sister does well in her new car!"" Or, ""My roommate's cat just died, and I wanted to warn god ahead of time that he can only pet Rex for two seconds before he'll chew his arm to pieces- that bit about being immortal doesn't matter."" 

I do this to be nice. If I were a cooler person who didn't care about tips, I would say, ""Pray for my soul, I'm an atheist.""

Alas.

So then Frank brings out all these new promo skillets. One is with rice, mushrooms, and grilled chicken smothered in Monterrey jack cheese, and the other one is rice, roast beef, peppers, and broccoli tossed in some kind of delicious asian spice. I love mushrooms and peppers for some weird reason, so I was in Nirvana. Donna was too, and after everyone had had their bit, we dove in for scraps. He even brought out a promo apple pie dessert, drizzled in caramel! Zomg!

In between the Epic Nomming, I was running out food for lazy people, and at one table they asked, ""Oh, if it's not too much trouble, can we get some more cornbread?"" And I, chipper, replied, ""Sure, ya'll, brb."" 

And I get back, and without realizing that there heads are bowed in devout PRAYER over their FOOD, I go,

""ALRIGHT FOLKS HERE'S YOUR CORNBREAD! :D :D :D :D ""

-- the one time NOT to be enthusiastic about your job. So the old man is like, reaching for the plate with his eyes closed, still PRAYING, and I'm trying not to buckle down into helpless tears of laughter. So I quietly move aside some cups and put the plate down before RUNNING THE HELL AWAY. Then Donna, Elizabeth and I were trying not to die laughing in the back.


And then. 

It happened.

A.) happened.
 1.) So, regular family comes in, right? A picky mother and her two blonde and beautiful teenage kids. They order 2 ribeyes and a large chef salad.

I know, I know, I should have had a hint then, but I ... I prefer to trust people. It's bad. REALLY bad.

So folks, I just want to say something real quick, even if it doesn't (and it probably doesn't, I'm just ranting) apply to you:

Pay for your goddamn food. I don't care if you don't leave a shitty waitress a tip. But pay for your goddamn food, because not paying for it has so many repercussions for that server, it's not. even. funny. And if you leave a good waitress (Me) without paying - FUCKING SHAME ON FUCKED-UP YOU. 

Right, but at least I'm not written up OR fired. (Because walk-outs are OUR fault, even though at Cracker Barrel they can WALK OUT THROUGH THE STORE ?!?)

 2. So a nice man and his nice, very blind wife come in and he's very chatty and we talk about the economy for .2 seconds before I have to get another table their drinks (I have five at this point). Anyway, so he wanted his soup out before the meal. However, after I get both tables their drinks out and go back to get the soup and the other table's bread -

The table's food is done. It took about 2 minutes because they ordered stew and grilled cheese. So I'm like ""Cool! :D"" And take it all out, thinking they'd be excited at how fast it took!

The man. Is pissed. He REALLY WANTED his soup out BEFORE the meal. And in my mind I'm going, ""Would you like me to go place it in the window again? I don't mind. :D"" But I'm a patient human being, so I apologize profusely and ask if he needs anything else. He grouchily says no, so I practically curtsy and then go to the next table and give them their bread. 

So I come back to check up on everyone, and the man doesn't like his soup. So he asks to see a manager. 

Actually, it was 'menu'. I misunderstood. 

But Gregarious Leo Manager Mike/Somewhat Shorter, Well-Groomed Hagrid comes out, booming cheerfully ""GOOD AFTERNOON SIR! PROBLEMS WITH THE STEW!? :D :D :D"" And it's impossible not to love this man, I swear. Well, my customer gets flustered and is all ""NO. No. MENU."" And we're all ""Eh?"" And then I melt into a heap of embarrassment on the floor, and Mike is booming: ""LET ME GET THAT SOUP OUT OF THE WAY FOR YOU WHILE HALEIGH FETCHES YOUR MENU! :D :D :D""

So I hurriedly do so, and bring it back, apologizing again, profusely (now horrifically red in the face). 

And he goes, ""Well, we're on the road, so on a time limit. >/"" 

Which is why he was... angry... about... his food.. coming out quickly...?  And why, next, he orders a ... hamburger steak...?

Well, he wants it rare, but we can't cook it rare, so he's all ""FINE. MEDIUM."" So I nod, apologize, and run to put the order in.

He. Is. Livid.

I. am. frazzled. 


3. That man eventually left- THANK YOU - but was replaced about an hour and a half later by a regular who I had never had before, but whom everyone said was an asshole. So I tread very, very carefully, and his wife said that she was impressed with me when I managed to carry out their drink orders correctly.

And I'm thinking, ""what. the fuck. Am I taking my N.E.W.Ts or something? Is this a test?"" 

Then he orders his eggs ""over light"". So Donna, who has been there for about ten years, has a huddle with me about ""over light eggs"" and we decide that just ringing in ""sunny side up"" will do the job.

NO FOLKS, NO IT DOES NOT. I've learned my lesson there.

But this man only growled and decided they look O.K. enough to eat, even though I practically begged him to let me take them back.


And after hiding from Mike all night after the walk-out incident, he eventually soothed by fears- he wasn't angry at me. He joked around with me and sang that one ""Haley's comet"" song at me, as he usually does. Frank was still displeased, but then, he's always displeased with me, and I really need to figure out why.

By the end of the night, Donna kept having to set me straight on what side work to do because I was so burnt out from the night. I kept sweeping other people's tables on accident and filling up salt and pepper shakers when they were supposed to be dumped out (Sunday). Finally, she practically pushed me out of the restaurant saying, ""go home, sweetheart. Take a bubble bath. Read a romance novel. Eat rocky road and make a cup of tea. UN. WIND.""

And I kind of did that."

"event","I know we can't foresee when things go wrong, and maybe I'm just heartless, but I'm really, really upset.

It was my day off, and I could have spent the evening watching movies with Haley before she went to bed (she had to get up early), but I'd promised Dani earlier that I'd get on and RP. 

There have been times when I've been late getting on, and I feel awful for those times.

But Haley was so forlorn about it, and I felt like a jerk when she came in and goes, ""I thought you were spending time with Dani tonight."" 

And I was like, ""Well, I was going to...""

So Dani didn't get on, and I watched Sinbad by myself, and felt really lonely. Then she gets on at 1:30 and her dog is sick, which is awful, yes. And she gets nervous and fretting and starts talking about the evil vet and how the dog might be really ill and the evil vet is really evil, and while I've never actually had a pet of my own before...

I guess, I just... wanted to say 'it was probably something she ate' or 'she was likely carsick - you took her to Wal-mart with you'. I dunno. I don't know anything about dogs, and I shouldn't presume to. 

So I guess I'll go to bed.  I'm such a heartless bitch.

I think I'm PMSing."

I'M UNGRATEFUL!

So Haley and I were lying down and chatting over her Ariel pillows and she was being a Capricorn and I was being an Aquarius, and it pains me that the antidote to the disease is at hand - everyone can see it, I can see it - yet I'm not brave enough to take it because of its bitter taste.

The bitter taste of sleep. 

I hear stories from Katie and Matt about their passion for their classes-  god knows they've worked to get to where they are, and maybe that's what makes their wonder that much greater.

Dad practically tied me to the Ewok and drove me to college himself. I didn't want to go immediately, but I didn't want to be left behind, so I let him.

Now I find I'm even more left behind. 

Perhaps it was the immediate bashing freshman year gave me - and there I was, determined to overcome, to prove them all wrong.

Now I'm just proving them right. 

I don't want to be here. I'm nothing here, and it's my fault. 

The only class that has worked its spell upon me this semester is Medieval Lit, and truth be told, it's one of the few I kept. In that class, I get a whiff of the passion I want so badly to swell within me until I'm brimming with it, utterly contagious. The last time I talked to the Lady she told me that I can't expect people to give me passion, that sometimes I have to create it myself. 

I used to be able to do that. I used to glare at people in math classes who said, ""Why do we need to know this shit?"" Because I would be thinking, ""Simply to know - because we can, because we have the ability, because we're blessed (in the most non-religious sense of the word) to be able to.""

Now I sit in class and watch the clock and will it to move quickly.
And before class, I watch the clock, and will it move more slowly. 
And at night, when I'm dreading tomorrow, I will it to stop entirely.

I had this idea that I was going to save the world, and I can't even save myself from drowning. 

I should be grateful to be here.

Why does the very mention of class nauseate me? What the hell am I sick with? Why do I feel burnt out when I've barely begun? 

I'm keep begging for time to bow to my wishes, and while I'm on my knees, it's wasting away."

""I'll take you over here."" 
Barely sparing her a glance I walked over
To the newly opened register.
Being bisexual isn't always a thing
About image,
Just to let you know. 
Sometimes,
The girl is just that 
<i>hott.</i>
""I have a lot of ones-
 I waitress.""
""Oh, I know the feeling."" 
I glance up now-
Pretty face, 
Wild hair, 
Dark eyeliner.
Aw, <i>fuck.</i>
""Ever get mistaken for a stripper?"" 
""I put'm straight before they can guess.""
""I don't mind counting.
I'm bored.""
So let's talk.
About leopard print underwear
And strippers
And sex-
And your typos
As you try to ring up
That cute pair of heels 
That were on sale
With the messed up
Barcode.
""Oh damn, I spelt 'heels' wrong.""
""Yeah. 'Hells.' It's too late.
They're cursed now.""
You laugh, and your fingers
Stumble,
And I grin, and play with rings.
Had I known before that we'd take this long
Laughing over stupid things,
It would have been even more of a reason
To get the one with the mussed up numbers-
And I would have gotten the shirt
With the missing tag.
Oh, <i>sigh.</i>
Here's what I would say
If I knew we flirting,
And not just being
Girls:
""I'll take you over here.
And over there.
And if you'd prefer to be discreet,
In the dressing room,
Against the mirror -""
Oh what would mother say,
I think,
And take my bag,
And belongings.
""Have a good one, babe."" 
""You too. Don't get too bored now.""
You laugh.

I walk out,
And it's not before I'm sitting,
That I realize

It was just too convenient
That you would be the one
To be checking me out
While I checked
You out."

I write in green and draw men with green beards all over my paper and My Little Pony versions of Gringolet. I answered questions in that class today, because I was so antsy and excited and no one else was talking or seemed half as excited as me. And whenever Dr. Koster reads aloud in Middle English, I just... I melt all over inside. It's the loveliest sound and I truly wish I could speak it.

Dr. Pearson beamed proudly at me when I came into class on time today. And I answered a question in Biology and nearly scared myself out of my seat to hear my own voice. 

Voice even went well. I'm having so much trouble with that German - she doesn't say anything much about it, but I know I must be butchering it. 

Work went smoothly tonight. I'm using a new battle tactic against Paul. He teases me perpetually - well, he teases everyone, tells them how to do their job, and he's half-joking, I know, but I'm certain he wants people to be scared of him. 

So I just started complimenting him! 

Paul: <i>Stirs tea.</i>
Hal: <i> Watches. </i>
Paul: ... What are you doing?
Hal: You stir the sugar into the tea with such elegance, Paul!
Paul: ....... I do every thing with elegance. I'm an elegant man. 


Paul: <i> Lectures Laura. </i>
Hal: Paul, you lecture so eloquently!
Paul: 'Eloquently'? YOU CAN'T FRIGHTEN ME WITH BIG WORDS. 
Hal: ............


Paul: <i> Drops a biscuit. </i>
Hal: <i> GASP. </i>  HOW do you do it?! Such grace, such masterful biscuit-dropping!
Paul: .................



Paul on the phone with Wendy: Yeah... yeah... I'll be off soon. Have you eaten? Do you want me to bring you something?
Hal: <i> Makes kiss-y faces. </i>
Paul: .........Alright baby, I'll see you in a bit.
Hal: Who was that Paul? Was that your lover? Are you in love? Did you know your eyes glow with warmth and your voice becomes soft when you speak to her? - Like the weight of the world has been lifted off your shoulders! <i> Dreamy sigh. </i>
Paul: Oh, that's because a hemorrhoid just came loose.
Hal: <i> pwn'd. </i>
Everyone: DIES. 


... So I lost that one. 


BUT he didn't do his side work, so I ended up having to do it, so now I really have to win. 

It was a good night though.

OH AND -

I liked Coraline, and I'd like to see Coraline in 3-D, but Coraline in 3-D on my one morning off to have breakfast just ... I dunno, it would slice my day in half. I guess it doesn't make sense, or maybe I'm just no fun. When I asked Haley if she wanted to have breakfast with me tomorrow, she said, ""But I thought you didn't have time to do anything this weekend? We could go see Coraline."" And I'm like ""... I have to work at 5:30. It would kill my day.""

I don't know. She wanted to see Batman Begins twice in a row when it was at the dollar theatre- I'd already seen it four times before. It was fun, sure, but I kind of don't want to go through it again, and I get the feeling that's what's happening with Coraline here. I love it, I really do, I will buy it when it comes out on DVD, but... I really would rather have a satisfactory breakfast, I guess.

Maybe I'm just no fun. 

I want to call my mom and see if she'll meet me tomorrow for breakfast, but I don't know if she's up..."

"event","I got off work early, yes, even after the <a href=""http://a-little-wisp.livejournal.com/50452.html"">Rebellion</a> (or see below entry), and Haley and I went to see Coraline since Neil Gaiman is the love of my life and Coraline the book is FANTASTIC. The movie was also FANTASTIC and I did jump at a part, yes, and I was wonderfully scared at points, though the movie never lost its child-like allure - it was SO much fun. NICE job. There were parts that differed from the book, but didn't exactly harm the story. I was actually thrilled at how much of the story stayed <i>intact</i>. Oh, Neil. 

Then, as expected, I lost my keys. 

Haley panicked a bit, I did not. We searched the bathroom and had a girl call the manager - no one had found any keys. So we went back to our theatre and searched for them. You can laugh, yes, because I found them in my cupholder. Haley was frustrated with me, and... then she dropped her phone, somehow, and the battery went sliding into the darkness. 

I laughed, yes.

I was also the one who found it, almost ten minutes later, thanks to my cellphone light. We'd almost been about to give up when I saw it between two chairs on the aisle that had been in front of us (WIN). 

So we left and were like ""Food?"" ""Food."" ""Aiight!"" And went to Denny's where we gorged. 

We were leaving when my phone rang. I looked at the caller ID ... and it was Haley. So confused, I asked, ""Dude, why are you calling me?"" And she goes, ""I'm not.""

After seeing a somewhat dark movie - kids movie or no - we were both momentarily spooked (for those of you who have seen the movie: Other Haley. AAAAH). Then she checked for her phone... it wasn't there. She'd left it at Denny's.

We collected the cellphone. (The waitress knew who to call because she knows my name. It's not creepy, we're friends. How? Long story. Let's just say, I talk to strangers.) 

FINALLY we returned home and... you know, I realized, because I lose stuff *so much* I am so much more chill than other people when shit happens to me. Haley was like ""Omgomgomg someone could have stole your car!"" 
And I was all, ""Nah, nah dude, it'll be cool. Chill."" 

I think I'm part crazy. Goodnight!

I was laughing hysterically by then. As much as I lose stuff or leave things behind, it felt REALLY good not to be the one in spotlight."

"event","(Names were changed)

Though having only gained a few short hours of slumber the night before, the Night Warriors strode into their domain. Outside, it was warm with a hint of spring wafting through the air. Inside, the kitchens were hot and the air thick with oils, but the warriors fought through it - they were there to serve.

Most every day they did this - Silent Carmen, small but stout-hearted, Black-Haired Harrison, quick and gregarious, lovely Elizabeth the Gentle, Harrison's lady, the fair Emily of Haunting Eyes, and Haleigh, the Bright-Eyed-and-Bushy-Tailed-Ribbon-Wearing Lady of Laughter. They worked on the West Field, where the customers were rough and worn, where smoke drifted up from every table - no clear-lunged man or woman ever dared to step foot in those lands.

The West Field and the East Floor Night Warriors served every wanderer that passed through the doors with grace and efficiency. 

It was not long after midday, however, when Black-Haired Harrison discovered something awful: The warriors who had served that morning had not completed their tasks, tasks that were meant to support the evening soldiers so that their work went smoothly, uninterrupted - safely. In fury, our hero slammed the freezer door shut, the sound startling the other workers. He then strode away, wordlessly, from the the empty containers that should have been filled with condiments for the evening workers. 


Haleigh was not laughing any longer, the light fading from her eyes as she peered into the empty bins. She herself had been meant to scout the condiment area, and now she was worried about what else had been left undone. 

Lady Donna, who worked on the East Floor, cried out in anguish as she discovered that of the bleu cheese, yea, verily, that fine cheese, there was none to be found! Haleigh moaned as she discovered that cups and lids had not been stocked either, and that surely all would fall behind in the afternoon with all the work that had to be done, that had been left undone.

""Damn me!"" Cried Matt the Stoic from behind the steamtable as he discovered that his tools had not been properly stocked. ""It seems the warriors who came before us would rather commit murder than do their duty!""

How could they have been so betrayed?

Then, Harrison appeared, his eyes blazing with fury as he cast down parchment into the window for all to see.

""Here me now!"" He cried, and the mournful faces of the once-proud Night Warriors lifted in his direction. ""Here me now, my friends, for we shall not suffer these injustices! We have been betrayed! Each night, when the hour is darkest, we fight to hold our ground, to please the people, and now those whom we trusted to help us - as we help them before we wearily retire - have turned their backs on us! Should the Lords whom we answer to not hear our plea for justice, such a revolt we will start that the walls of this building will tremble in our rage and the biscuits we cook will taste of resentment and the cornbread of revenge!  TOO LONG we have come to battle to find that we carry more than our own load! No more! Here, upon these pieces of parchment, we will each state our grievances and sign, and then pass them on directly to the Lords of the House so that they may, if they are just, mete out the correct punishment to those who have failed us! Time and again we have tried to express our displeasure through the spoken word, individually - now our voices shall be united as one, in silence, as our pens cry out, 'JUSTICE' to a such volume that the calls of the heralds in heavens shall be overcome, that the wails and the echoes of lashings in hell will be subdued. Come together now, and with the same ink that you upon your ground serve the people, sign this parchment! Speak out, write out! When this is completed, I will deliver the parchment myself, and we shall be heard. GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME...

Free biscuits, on the job."" 

With a roar, the warriors rushed forward, each of them pouring out from their hearts the long repressed anger they felt for the stress they'd been dealt.

""Never again, when I arrive at the noon-hour, must I find any sort of blackberry glob in my microwave again!"" Cried Haleigh, and in her trademark bright, glittering green ink, she recorded each of the errors of the midday warriors' ways, and then with large sweeping strokes constructed her signature so that all would know how strongly she felt.

After everyone had signed, Harrison brought the parchment to our Lords.

Lord Mike read the parchment, and as voice after voice described each gruesome detail in their account, his face turned red, and the big man rose. His voice rumbled like thunder, so loud it was that even the bravest of men would feel a quiver of fear in his heart, and with fire in his eyes he cried, ""WHO WERE THE LIEUTENANTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERSEEING OF THE WARRIORS' TASKS?""

Only one came forward, the other having fled two hours ago. The one who came had few words, she only sputtered out foul excuses as the Lord glowered down at her with a less than understanding gaze. She thought she would burst into flames from his fury, from her shame, then and there.

""TELL ME HARRISON,"" roared the Lord. ""THE NAMES OF THE WARRIORS."" 

""I cannot,"" Harrison replied, his voice grim. ""The names were long ago erased off of the list."" 

""AS YOU WILL THEN. I WILL SEE TO THIS TOMORROW. NEVER AGAIN WILL THIS OCCUR, YOU HAVE MY WORD."" 

The joyous calls of the warriors filled the aisles, and the Western troupe clapped Harrison on the shoulder for his good work. 

""I must say,"" Haleigh shouted to him, the laughter back in her tone, ""I've always wanted to be a part of a rebellion! It will go down in history books, to be sure!"" 

""To be sure! Harrison's Rebellion!"" 

Much merry-making followed, but the rebellion had not solved the problem at hand - there was still much work to be done in order to catch up before the evening siege. 

Such is the warrior-life of a Waiter, or a Waitress, whose task is to serve. Serve they will do, and proudly, but behind their dedication lies a need to be respected.

""It is such a pity I missed it,"" sighed the Lady Elizabeth to Haleigh as she rolled her silverware dejectedly.

""Aye. 'Twas a powerful moment, Lizzy. Quite powerful."" 


---- 

 In other news, they call me ""Captain"" and ""Diablo"" at work- the chefs that is, which is quite nice (Captain because of a scarf I wore in my hair one day, Diablo because I used to play the game)!! Getting along much better with everyone. Today there were a lot of kids at my tables, and I really, really love most of the kids I get in there. They're so much fun to talk to, and their parents really appreciate the attention we pay them. ANYWAY. More school work and work tomorrow, and hopefully more epic moments to follow from each!"

"event","THIS MORNING: 

It began, friends, with an eviction notice of Epic Fail.

Because I paid rent and there is no way in hell I would be out of here in 10 days, even if they did have their way. 

I didn't pay rent on *time*. It should be smooth sailing after I call the people and sort things out, but what a horrible way to start a day!

I was late for work and the district manager had to pep-talk me and convince me that the cops weren't coming for me before I was chill enough to hit the floor, but I fuckin' love Frank, ya'll, he's the best. 

Anyway, I worked 9 hours and went home with 81 bucks, which isn't bad! And one lady said I had a lot of patience. Which made me grin. 

It's all been hectic lately, even though right now I feel pretty happy. Birthday week wasn't what I expected, but I dunno.... things are just odd! 


...Gawd, this was a pointless post."

"event","So I accidentally fell asleep at like, 7:30 last night. In my clothes. Teeth unbrushed. I was not trashed, no, I just had one hour of sleep the night before. I wish I had been trashed, because then someone would have at least known to help me get my pants off. 

When I woke up today, at 8:20 AM, I kind of wanted to shoot myself in the face. 

And I heard music. 

So I went out to make coffee, my hair in crazy bedhead J-pop style, still half-drooling probably, and obviously in the same clothes I wore yesterday. My back hurt, my head hurt, and I was scowling. 

Then my roommate dances out of her room, bathed and dressed in her winter attire, playing mp3s on her phone as she practically skips out the door.

""Don't be a grumpy gills!"" She calls cheerfully. ""You had lots and lots of sleeeep! Have a good day, dear!""  And promptly shuts the door behind her, Rilo Kiley serenading her down the hallway...

And I siiighed.

Then, at least I was scowling anymore.

Might not be such a bad day."

"event","It's snowing. 

And because I'm so excited that it's snowing, I couldn't sleep.

I kept rolling around and sitting up and my stomach was clenching and I was, for some reason, quite <i>nervous</i>, which confused me as I was supposed to be thrilled that it was snowing, and the <i>snow</i> should be my reason for wanting to stay up late. Then it hit me. 

My nerves have something to do with the snow, yes, but also something that I've been pondering about for a good year now: 

Maybe it's time that I let my professors look at some of my poetry and short stories/story ideas. I have plenty of professors I could go to, but I'm absolutely terrified of criticism. I know, I know: ""Haleigh, you won't get very far in life unless you have adamantium balls."" I don't have balls, much less adamantium balls. Certainly, I've stood up to criticism without shedding a tear plenty of times before, but when it's something as near and dear to me as my poetry, as any of my writings, I tend to get seasick-ish when someone asks to look over any of it. The same goes for my drawings and singing, but my WRITING is the real nail-biter. 

Since I turn into a heap of trembling flesh when my <i>friends</i> read my writing, what the hell would happen to me if one of my <i>professors</i> handed back my folder and said, ""These are cute."" 

Cute. 

I'd probably throw my shoe at them. I mean, that's what people say about my stuffed animals, or my BOOBS, but not stuff that I've poured pieces of my soul into. 

It is, however, snowing, and as much as I'd like to stay up googling things like ""Advice for New Writers"", I should probably hit the sack so I can play in the frozen fluff before every one wakes up and RUINS it."

-Enya


I hope every one has a wonderful year ahead of them. Never in my life - well, maybe a couple of times - have I actually driven home in the silence of my car on New Year's morning and thought over the things that this year has brought me.

I started the night off at Neesah's in which we accidentally lit a small portion of someone's yard on fire (we stomped it out, it's good) and I nearly blew up my friends with a bottle rocket (they're good too) while shouting ""EXPELLIARMUS"" - bottle rockets are not wands, fyi. 

Then we all cuddled. 

Then Haley and I drove home (the first song of 2009 was 'One Cell in the Sea' by A Fine Frenzy. Excellent.) And we were thirsty. And got root beers. Not real beers. And then while my car warmed up, we sat in her driveway and drank and munched. Not even drunk. Not even tipsy. 
And I asked her:

""So what's your best memory from 2008?"" 

""... I don't know. I'd have to give it some thought. You?"" 

""... ... I ... well. I don't know either. A few bad ones."" 

""Like what?"" 

""Like... crying on the front porch of Tillman after I discovered I couldn't drop my class. Sobbing to Dad on the phone.""

""Better than crying in the parking lot behind Johnson."" 

""Mm."" 

""Yea."" 

""I'm not where I wanted to be."" 

""Me neither."" 

""Let's transfer."" 

""shyea. Not with my GPA."" 

""Shit. Me neither.

And then when I got in my car, I really thought about it. And I was like, ""Dear lord, did the bad really outweigh the good this year?"" Let's see. 

-I had a boyfriend. 
-I did things with a boyfriend.
-I'm still a virgin.
-I dumped my boyfriend after a month. He was miserable. 
-I failed a class (on accident). 
-I had the most wonderful LOTR class anyone could have ever asked for.
-I sang and made my teacher cry (in a good way. It was wonderful. Probably one of the best memories of this year). 
-I painted a picture (it was awful). 
-I had one of the best history classes I've ever had in my life. 
-I brought Bird seashells.
-I wrote one my best essays yet. 
-I had a good summer at the beach. 
-I spent time with Katie. 
-I still daydream about the boy from AWA who dipped me and blahdeeblah. So over. 
-I realized my sisters were becoming distant.
-I wrote some poems. 
-My hair went from long to short, to really, really short.
-I tapped into my 'fashion sense.' 
-I have a wonderful roommate and have expanded upon a wonderful friendship.
-I love Barbie movies.
-I still miss Katie like hell. 
-I cried for my mother.
-My grandmother is getting old. 
-My father and I have pretty much stopped fighting. Knock on wood.
-Got a speeding ticket.
-Bought a green dress. And a bikini.
-And another one.
-Invested in 'skinny jeans.' 
-Stole a chair. Kinda.
-I failed at NaNo. ;___; 
-I got a makeover. 
-I realize that <i> maybe I do meet friends everywhere </i>, according to Haley (i.e., the Wal-Mart dudes, the girl at the Twilight movie, the guy from that one store, the other Wal-Mart lady, Greta, the wedding planner from South Park Mall, the Starbucks barista boy, Haley's Starbucks friends, the girl who sat behind me in Logic & Lang, the lady from Target who asked me about the Hello Kitty bandaides, the girl in the dressing room beside me at XXI, the manager at Dunkin Donuts who offered me a job WHILE I was working at Cracker Barrel, WTHELL) - ok, maybe they're just acquaintances, but we all BONDED and made MEMORIES. 
-I got a job waitressing. I got a job WAITRESSING? 
-I miss my friends in Myrtle Beach and want more time to see Erin, Karen, Wayne, Amber, Mark, Dany, Justin-  wait, who else still lives there? :/ 
-I became obsessed with a few things.
-I had a great time making fun of Twilight.
-Thanksgiving was good.
-Christmas was good. 
-I sang on stage. 
-I voted for OBAMA YEEEAAAA. 
-I wimped out of going to the musical auditions. 
-I love Wordsworth. And Tennyson. And you know what, I love Yeats. And I love... poetry. And Akhmatova. And HE WINKED AT ME YES?! And Robert G. Ingersoll. I love that guy too.
-I miss Mrs. Shuford.
-AND. and....
-I'm starting the new year off with a cruise. Grandparent's 50th. 

Ok, there are more good things. But it's still not where I wanted to be. I wanted to be braver and smarter and writing a goddamned book, but I'm not. I'm not as responsible as I want to be, or independent, and time flies faster and faster, and this is all I've got. This is my life. I've got to do something. I have to, and I have to do it quickly. I still need more courage. I need to ... pick myself up. Courage, courage. 

Truly, I love all of you so much - those who still read this. xD 

So goodnight! I'm sleepy, and I have a big day ahead of me tomorrow!

Sweet dreams.

<i>My! My! Time flies! A new day is on its way, so let's let yesterday go
Could be we step out again
Could be tomorrow, what then? 
Could be 2010... <i>"

"event","How strange that this should come up again:

Religion. 

It seems to follow me everywhere when I'm just trying to have a relatively normal day. I was stumbling over facebook profiles when a note caught me eye. It was a girl who had a philosophy professor for her Human Experience class and ended up questioning her faith. I read it through, impressed by her courage, and then read the comments. A few of them were from Christians, who promised to pray for her and hoped she found Christ again. Another was from her father, who reminded her again and again that it was their prayers that have guided her through college and being away from home ... 


And I ... clenched my fist and shook my head. I would have no problem - and I don't, generally- with Christians, until they do that. 

There's a quote in Neil Gaiman's <i>Sandman</i> in which Lucifer says, ""'The devil made me do it.' I have not made of them do anything. They live their own lives. I do not live their lives for them."" It goes both ways, good and bad. This girl is apparently doing very well in college and it is not by her parent's prayers or the will of god that she is succeeding, it is because she <i> has courage </i>, and I think that is far more admirable than believing in any deity wholeheartedly. Once again, I understand why religion is necessary in many cases, but I find it almost silly that the religious don't look deep enough themselves as to why it isn't. 

Last night, a guy came over to help my roommate and her boyfriend study. My roommate let it slip that I was an atheist, and he seemed pretty stoked. He said, ""I hate how people think that just because a person is atheist means that they have no morals. I think it's brave to have morals that don't stem from a god, or because a person is afraid that they're going to heaven or wish to go to hell."" It made me feel really good. 


To the parents, who do not read this: 

Your children will change. They will move away, start careers, get married, have kids, and grow old. They will, just as you do, grow spiritually as well. They will question - admire them. Encourage them. If a child from an atheist family becomes a Christian, hope that they will be strong enough in their belief to stand on their two feet when angry nonbelievers (and there are many) try to shoot them down, hope that they will know that all of their goodness comes from what they've made themselves to be, that all their victories and defeats stem from the choices they make and nothing else. If a child from a Christian family becomes atheist, hope that it is not a nihilistic atheism. Hope that they have morals - does their need to be a reason why they have them as long as they do? - and keep practicing them. Pray for them if you must, but may you realize one day that the road they walk isn't easy, and that by being atheist, one has realized that life is too short and to precious to be spent on one's knees before an altar. 

Most importantly, love your children - it is the one truth of all religions and those who choose not to practice them. It is universal, and it makes living beautiful. No matter how different two people become, no matter how much a relationship transforms, love is there, growing, evolving but unchanging. 

I am an existentialist. One of my teachers described it as a person thinking that their existence was equivalent to a speck of vomit floating in the universe, and I quote. And certainly, to those who don't wish to delve into it, it seems a scary thing from the outside - being alone, being responsible, knowing that one has to keep making choices in an absurd world, hoping beyond reason. 

But read <i>The Little Prince</i>, read Dostoevsky again. Think about it, Ms. Teacher.

Life becomes that much more precious, each choice that much more important. You don't have to believe what I believe, but at least respect me for simply believing."

"event","""Today you possess a rare combination of positive energy, confidence, and attractiveness - and this dynamic trio will go a long way..."" 

My horoscope. I should have LOOKED at it. :D 

But maybe it's best that I didn't. 

I went to juries today (singing tests, for those who are thinking court jury) and... I got there early. And... even though I hadn't filled out any jury sheets, I did them really fast, panicking.

But I wore my rainbow ribbon, a pink shirt, gray slacks, and black heels (it all goes together, I swear, I live with a sorority kid, she checks out my outfits), and curled my hair. I was SO nervous about the lyrics to my German piece, but I calmed myself down. 

So I get into the greenroom and my accompanist chides me for saying the word ""pee"" and I was like ""GRRR"" but only on the inside, and then my Ex-voice teacher called us out on stage.

(As for that dude, we still get along well, actually. I felt a little abandoned when I was switched to another teacher, but we work really well together.) 

(""Hello Mrs.__!"" I called from the stage. ""Do you like my ribbon?""
""I love your ribbon!"") 

They let me pick my piece!! And so of course I thought about being a good girl and singing a foreign piece about springtime or my voice flying with the birds, but instead I went with Cole Porter's ""Love for Sale."" Which is about a prostitute. I mean, for my second piece I figured they'd make me do a foreign one anyway. 

(I would like to thank Ella for the inspiration, Zooey Deschanel who makes something simple into something beautiful, Cole Porter, my roommates for putting up with my ultra-loud bathroom singing...)

So I sang, doing my best (kinda) to sound like a sultry jazz queen. 

SOMETHING paid off. 

Because Ultimate Scary Voice Teacher of Experience (USCTE) at the end said, ""What's your major?"" 
And I was like ""English. I love it.""
And he goes, ""So do I. But you need to keep at this; you have a really lovely voice."" 
And I flustered and stared at my nails and said 'thank you' and then all the other teachers were going: 
Ex-VT: ""TOLD YOU SO!""
New VT: ""I KNOW, RIGHT?"" 
Ex-VT: ""YOU NEED. TO BELIEVE."" 
Hal: ""Je crois! ;-;"" 
New VT: "":O You need confidence!"" 
Other VT: ""Why don't you have confidence?"" 

Hal: ""... I'm not a major. I can't sing like some of the girls who are.""
Ex-VT: ""And, um, thank god for that. Just because they're majors don't mean they can sing."" 
Hal: "":/ That was mean."" 
Ex-VT: "":D yeah, well."" 

Other VT: ""Just because you aren't a major doesn't mean you <i>can't</i> sing.""
USCTE: ""You can sing very well."" 

Hal: ""... Ok. ... What about my next piece?"" 
Ex-VT: ""Have a Happy Holiday! :D"" 
Hal: ""... Wait, that's it? :O I only have to do ONE? :D :D :D :D"" 

USCTE: ""Well, you can sing all your songs if you'd like. :X"" 

Hal: ""... Nopegoodbye! *DASH*""

And ... it was a wonderful feeling. I might cry. Or go sing along to Barbie in my car.

Starbucks? Aiight."

"event","So. What in the hell. 

It sucks to be accused of being too nice, I swear to god. It makes me want to start throwing plates and screaming obscenities at everyone around me. 

But um, not going to happen. 

I hate it more though when they equate 'being nice' with 'being fragile.' One of our chefs said to me tonight, ""Girl, why you so fragile?"" And of course I harrumphed and chastised him, but... really? People have yelled at me, have been frustrated with me, but I let it roll off my shoulders, say hello to them each day, and continue working. I'm new. I need time to adjust. It's my first time waitressing.

I'm not the type to cave in and cry. I have principles. Those people are paying quite a bit to eat at our restaurant - I want them to have the best service possible, and I know that when I get in the groove of things, I can provide it.

And my Manager dude. Yeah. So Friday I made zilch, even though I had a section of three tables. NO ONE came in. I was so angry. I spent three hours there rolling silverware for absolutely nothing. I was upset. I brought it up to him, in a slightly-less-than-gentle manner (My patience was thin), and SINCE I complained.

He decided to be hard on me.

I came on Saturday assigned to four tables in the busiest section of the house. So I put in my adamantium spine and walked out that night with a pocket chock full of money. Tonight, the same thing. And sure, I mess up, I'm a little lost and confused, and I look young and act young and I'm nice. 


But shit. It doesn't mean I'm naive. I have mastered every job I worked at, but not without my mess-ups. 


So basically. :D I'll just do with the whole kitchen staff as I do with grumpy customers...

Kill them with kindness."

"event","HOPE EVERYONE HAD A GREAT THANKSGIVING.

So basically it was the best Thanksgiving evar. It started off badly simply because I was a little late to work and my first three orders went all haywire, but it actually turned out ok. Mainly because I kept smiling, kept keeping up my cheerfulness- it wasn't hard. The kitchen boys were once again really nice to me, everyone was very helpful, and the managers strove to keep everyone happy and on their toes. 

Someone said that the DM (District manager, yes, I made D&D jokes in my head) was coming in today, and I figured he would come as a customer or something, so everyone was bein' all ""Yeah, so you better be careful. He's watching."" And I'm all ""Zomg, Big Brother, what?"" 

Anyway, so me and this new dude kept talking. And he was all ""You're new here, right?""
And I was like ""Yeah, only my second day!"" ""You?"" And he goes ""Actually, I'm a manager-in-training. It's my first day here too! :D"" 

So we were all chummy and giving each other high fives, and he kept complimenting me on my perpetual cheeriness while girls cried and complained around me. 

I only had a section of two tables to watch all night, so making nearly 80 bucks was.. um... I was pretty content with my work. And I messed up, yes, but I rolled out later that night with my chores finished and my tables conquered. 

Oh, and you guessed it. ""New Manager"" guy was actually the District Manager. And before I left he came over and said, ""Haleigh, you really did a great job, I was SO impressed. Btw. I'm District Manager. :D"" 

And I felt SO giddy. And some dude at one of my tables called me pretty. SO flustered.

I went to our Thanksgiving Dinner late. Btw, my family has a VERY traditional thanksgiving. People bring stuff, grandmother cooks, and we sit around the dining room table for typical Woodlief Family fun! :D

This is where the fun begins. So I came in late, and everyone was cheering because I'd made it. I hugged the two guests first-  Linda, my dad's new girlfriend who is fabulous - and Anna Marie, my brother's darling g/f. I always kiss her cheeks, cause she's just so pretty. 

Anyway, so I'm scarfing and stuff. And we're all talking and laughing. Well, Dad's telling bad jokes and we're laughing more at him than his jokes, but word. Then I go to shove this giant forkful of greenbeans into my mouth. And my brother's like, ""Zomg, it's the Woodlief nom!"" And my grandmother goes, ""She could fit anything in that big ol' mouth of hers!""

So I tried not to look at anyone, to keep my thoughts to myself, but I just HAPPENED to catch Matt's eye. And then it was over.

So I stopped chewing, because I would have choked and died, I was laughing so hard. My brother had tears of laughter pouring down his cheeks, and my uncle was rubbing my shoulder all, ""Just... just don't think about it ... in that way... "" While he laughed. So basically the whole table was keeled over laughing except my grandmother, who was still lost and going, ""WHO DID THIS TO HER?"" ""YOU DID!"", and my grandfather, who was all ""hrmhrm!""-ing at the end of the table and trying to settle us down. So I went to the kitchen to control my self, and everyone was pretty calm by the time i sat down. 

Then my grandmother said, ""You should have just swallowed."" And laughter erupted around the table again. But she was grinning all mischievously. And it was hilarious.

So it was really, really fun. :D Aaand. yea! 

And then my grandmother came downstairs coughing later that night, and I stayed up with her for a bit. God... that's scary. Post on that later though. I'm off to get ready for another night of work.

Might nom on some leftover's before I go too. <3"

WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

So I was using this old clock in the bathroom to keep track of time while I did my hair AHAHAHAHA 1.) thing that went wrong. It was a little TOO SLOW. And of course, by the time I finished, I had twenty minutes to be at work. So five minutes later I ran out to my car with a PB&J and a cup of water to take ibuprophen (because I knew I would need it), and hopped in the Ewok giving myself a pep talk. 

Yeah. Uhhh... 

2.) Car wouldn't start. Turns out I had left a light on in there all night.


Uh huh. So there I was, baby-talking the tired ol' Ewok, begging, pleading, offering my soul. And just when I was about to give up, he vroomed to life, and I nearly cried in relief.

So. 3.) Got to work late. 

So Big Manager had told me, ""It's alright. We're gonna keep a close eye on you and make sure you're doin' ok. No need to worry- it's your first day waitressing."" 

YEAH. WHATEVER. Well, I was thrown to wolves just like I had asked. It worked. I learned a helluva lot of stuff today like. 

4.) Shattering your first glass makes you feel ... less nervous, for some reason.

5.) Don't listen to the Trainer Girl about the ketchup in the container thing. That's ridiculous.

6.) Make sure when you say, ""No cheese"" it goes under the RIGHT item. You earn nicknames like ""Grilled cheese girl!"" when it goes under a sandwich that requires cheese to be A GRILLED CHEESE. 

7.) If Nice Lady checks your silverware out, make sure the manager checks your silverware out too, or he'll feel left out and get angry.

8.) In the case of restocking the root beer refrigerator and accidentally popping a cap off, give it to the manager.  

Of course, good things happened too.

1.) Helping others out is HELPFUL IN MANY WAYS. 
2.) Learn to laugh at yourself. You'll get points for it.
3.) Always smile at the chefs. They'll treat you right.
4.) Chef: Hey baby, you havin' fun yet?
Hal: Uh, tons.
Chef: No you ain't.
Hal: Fuck no, I'm not.
Chef: :X Figured as much. 
5.) ""HEY GRILLED CHEESE GIRL""
""I AM NEVER GOING TO LIVE THAT DOWN, AM I?"" 
""NOPE. IT'S GOING IN THE RECORDS."" 
6.) Chef: Hey, what did you mean by this? 
Hal: *This*
The Perpetually Scowling Fellow: She did that part right. *Takes Hal aside* You did that part right, don't listen to him. But you didn't do the grilled cheese part right. You're still fine. 
7.) Always talk to the old people. They will gab. And love you for taking the time to chat. 
8.) Asking questions can only help. Double checking with someone else can help even more. 
9.) The Perpetually Scowling Guy probably hates you, but atleast he's nicer than he was before. 

So here I am, a waitress, with tips in pockets, even though I only got three tables over a three hour period.

But it was fun. And.

Thank you, Starbucks crew.

Manager: Hey! How's it going?
Hal: ... Pretty good, how are you?
Manager: Good! 
Hal: ...*Hands him four dollars* 
Manager: .. Ah... *looks SO lost*
Hal: ... :X I'm assuming it's above three and under four?
Manager: OH RIGHT. The total. *Rings her up* Sorry, it's so crazy in here, and we only have two people on the floor...
Hal: No, really, it's ok! ^^ 
Manager: *hands her the drink* It was actually 4.25, but don't worry about it.
Hal: Oh! Are you... are you sure?  
Manager: Positive! 
Hal: Thanks! :D Have a good holiday!
Manager: You too! :D 



It gets better! :D It always gets better."

"event","I cleaned my room. It's gorgeous. I forgot how much I love my stuff when it's ... ordered. 

The semester has dissolved into a train wreck of bad grades, absences, and overall disappointment in every class - it's not the teacher, it's me. Somewhere along the way, the wheels rattled loose and I lost it - I just... stopped. I don't know when it happened. I think it was when my sleep started getting funky. 

But I came home this weekend from my mother's and looked around and just... dove in. I wanted, for one day, to do something right - and I still don't feel as accomplished as I'd like. 

I really, really, miss Katie. Like, it's pretty agonizing right now. We keep playing this awful game of phone tag, where I'm in class when she calls me, or she doesn't have a signal when I call her - I just want to drive up there and pick her up, and I may. 

But now there's work to consider, and when I get my next break. 


The worst part of all this is... that I'm happy. I'm happy, for some absurd reason. There's nothing behind it. I'm just... happy. As if everything's going bad, but something's changing. The holidays this year will be different.

I think I've found hope."

                                              my tongue

                                     shrieking in my head and in this lonely bed
                                   I am so cold, and it's so unbearably empty

         and the house is so 
          unbearably silent
                And though
                I've never
               been afraid 
         Of being alone with
                                                       Myself and calling sleep

                                                        into the resting world

So, for our Brit. Authors class we were divided into groups. I just happened to land in a group of intelligent, beautiful females to study ""The Lady of Shalott."" Yeah, I know, SO. LUCKY. That NEVER happens. And we all got along swell and exchanged phone numbers. Anyway, the beautiful curly-haired Scorpio Hannah decided to be the leader (because she's a scorpio, and they're good leaders - see: my brother - but not good Borg leaders), and I was cool with that since I only take on as much responsibility as I KNOW I can handle. And she's been fabulous! And we had meetings! But the last meeting, only Hannah and I showed up. ...

... So we were like 'Ok. We've got a week or two.' And Hannah was going to be gone this Sunday.


So I get on facebook at 4:00, checking to see if the meeting is still on, and EVERYONE IS PANICKING ON OUR THREAD. Because everyone thinks OUR MEETING IS TUESDAY.

So I decided NOT to panic. 
 
Somehow, in the hell hole of my binders, I found the sheet of phone numbers and worked everything out. And made everyone send Rebecca their notes, because she has to write up questions. And I'm pretty pooped after that brief ten minutes of fixing everyone's shit and bitching at everyone to plan to meet tomorrow - no excuses. Our meeting isn't Tuesday. It's next week. 

I'm not on time. Ever. But I do have a schedule. 

PROOF: that Aquarians aren't entirely crazy.

"event","There are nights when I simply can't sleep. The weight of the world is pressing upon me, and there are so many things to start and finish that I simply don't know where to begin. A strange, foreign feeling of loneliness creeps in - not a loneliness for people, but a loneliness for things I haven't been able to do in so long, and wonder if I'll ever do again. There's a loneliness for understanding, for simply wanting to lay outside under the stairs with a friend and talk about things beyond this world, laughing until our sides hurt, crying for absolutely no reason.

The quiet of the apartment has long past descended, and I'm in my room, half-asleep, half-awake, hands clutching my pillow tight in fear for tomorrow - I don't want it to come. 

I think this insomnia stems from something that happened in my youth a few times. 
When my father was still married to Felicia, the awful woman who made our lives a living hell, I was, well, very young. I was in elementary school, I was awkward and shy and never without a book. Dad had always tucked us in when my brother and I were ittybitty, and we, being the clever kids we were, would keep him up for as long as possible telling us stories or jokes or singing us stupid songs. When it was storming outside, I would crawl into his bed with Sarah - always had trouble lifting myself into it - and sleep there for the night. When Felicia came, things changed. ""Good night"" ended with ""good night,"" and phones were taken away and doors were shut. I, of course, had some problems. 

There were nights when, after the door was shut, I would start panicking. I thought that, as soon as I'd fall asleep, I would die- or worse, that demons and awful things of my imagination you'd only see in the Berserk anime series would creep from my closet to torment me. I'd start hyperventilating, and because I knew Felicia would come in and yell at me if I panicked, I'd tried to keep it in for as long as possible. Naturally, after fifteen minutes of shaking and crying I'd start screaming and calling for Dad - Dad rarely came, because Felicia would say ""I'll handle it."" She'd come upstairs and tell me to stop screaming, that I would not, no matter how much I pitched a fit, be able to stay up late, and that I might as well get passed it. ""Just stay with me! For a little while?"" I'd beg, but she refused me and went out and shut the door, telling me that if I opened it, I was going to get hell from her. I was terrified of that woman. I know, she doesn't seem too much like a bad guy, but she was, in the big picture - she was a raving alcoholic, destroyed my father and my brother's relationship, had my brother on pills he did not need, lied to my mother about them, and mentally abused her daughter, my step-sister. My father will never live down his guilt. While she was only there for most of my elementary school days, she attempted, and succeeded sometimes, at manipulating me against my brother with guilt, and these days I'm very conscious of manipulation and avoid using it and succumbing to it. 

(It was my Cinderella story. I hate calling it that, because I never felt like that when I was there, but because I was never able to go to my friends' houses until all of my chores were finished, <i>they</i> called me Cinderella, jokingly. But it really wasn't a joke. Every week we'd have a printed list of chores posted to our doors, and when Matt and Melissa neglected to do theirs, I had to cover for them so that we all didn't have to suffer the consequences. I still remember being so young that I couldn't reach the knobs on the washing machine and having to climb up to do my clothes, and scrubbing our bathtub for four hours, or a pot for thirty minutes that she'd claimed wasn't clean every time I brought it to her to check. Her reign ended over me when she made my mother cry. If anything, I know how to clean a bathtub and have been washing my own clothes since... before I can remember. Anyway, off topic.)

So I was in my room, having panic attacks, for quite of few nights of my childhood until I received my brother's hand-me-down gameboy and started stealing flashlights to read books. I also learned where the creaky floorboards were in my room (Felicia could hear us moving around upstairs through the floorboards) and evaded them as I stealthily turned on my closet light. When Felicia left, Dad extended our bedtimes a little later. Even after I went to bed, I would sit up, restless and wondering, too energetic to sleep. Three o'clock would roll around, and I would still be staring up at the ceiling. When computers came into the picture, they were my best distraction from those long hours of nothingness. Fear of death morphed into a fear of tomorrow, anxiety about the homework I didn't do, about the paper due Wednesday, about having clothes to wear for the next day when my brother's clothes were in the washer... 

And so I think I have insomnia. I procrastinate at everything, including sleep. I don't know how to fix it. I'll go to bed now, and I'll likely fall asleep quickly, but for a brief five minutes, my heart will flutter around in my chest as I think of the reading I forgot to do for tomorrow's class, my job interview at 2:00, Dr. Brownson's paper due Wednesday, the song test next week, I haven't practiced yet, <small>and there are still demons in my closet.</small>"

Are you scared? Darlings, who isn't? It's change. The first step onto any unknown path is frightening, but we've all taken each other's hands and moved together. It's no different than falling in love - you give your heart to someone and hope they'll keep it safe, we trust them. We've entrusted a great treasure into new hands, and it's ...

The best feeling I've had in a long time. I don't think I'll regret it. One day my grandchildren will ask me who I voted for on this memorable occasion, and I will tell them: ""I voted for change - the one with big ears. I was hopin' they'd help him listen better."" And then I'll cackle and cough as I clutch my cane.

We... we took the path less traveled by.

America, friends - I am SO PROUD OF YOU ALL. We have come since when Abraham Lincoln, as Barack Obama has, stepped out of Illinois and made a brave stand. We have broken through what I think may be the final barrier on this rocky path towards absolute equality.

"event","Mid-day post!

Today has been deliciously autumn! Maple brown sugar oatmeal, Thanksgiving blend, Lovecraft and Gaiman as my morning reads!

I swear to god, I would not get up at 8:00 AM for anyone but DeRochi. How I manage to participate is a mystery to me. 

But, I LOVE this apartment. I mean, sure, we have a dude who stays here 24/7 and doesn't pay rent, but ... the apartment is clean (not our rooms, but the apartment), we have food, we're congenial. Well, Haley and I get along ridiculously well- although had we been living in a dorm room together, our rooms would resemble a county in the City of Dis. This was a very good idea. 

Haley and I are single, so it's good to have someone to talk to who feels lonely too sometimes. Although, as common as it is for me to occasionally complain of not having a boyfriend, I really don't know what I'd do with one when I got him. I think that's generally my problem. >> 

Boyfriends weren't a part of my growing up - crushes certainly were, but relationships seem so foreign to me, so that when people talk about their strings of boyfriends and dramas that go back to elementary school, I feel soooo out-of-touch. When I was dating a few months ago, it... was weird, to be honest. I've always opened doors for myself, drove myself around, paid for my own food and movies (oh wait, I still did - AND his! Wow!), played my own video games. I didn't call him - I don't even call my closest friends that often. I assume that, because we're close, we'll be fine if we don't talk to each other for a week - I'm not so insecure as to feel like 'silence' means there's a problem. Sometimes I'm extraordinarily peppy and talkative, but people realize when they get close to me that I am, for the most part, a very quiet, thoughtful person. I mean, ok, if I had a boyfriend, maybe a week would be a little too long - but I can DEFINITELY go without speaking to him for a day. I would... kind of need that, you know? I'm so used to being alone, to having my independence, that sometimes I felt like calling him was a <i>chore</i>. I think, I really think, that I'm a malfunction. I have these dreams of falling in love, but... I think I'm broken. And I feel like, in a way, if I do ever fall in love I may screw things up because I'm so inexperienced when it comes to being in a relationship. Not saying I don't want to fall, I do, very much, but how would I make it last? 

Another thing- I've been told before, when offering advice on relationships, that my advice is void because I myself have so little experience with them. But you know, it truly is fascinating to realize how much observers notice (read Aphra Behn, <i>Oroonoko</i>). It's the most frustrating thing in the world to see exactly the problem in someone's relationship - she needs to chill the fuck out and let him go out with his friends, he needs to start opening up - but you can say nothing to help. And sometimes, people just don't want it. And truly, it's no one's business but the couples. But the thing is - people shouldn't ask for advice when they don't want to hear it, just the same as no one should give it unless it's asked for. However, a person should want friends who love him enough to tell him when he's wrong - at least in their opinion- and STILL love him. No, I can't possibly understand what that individual person is going through because the experience is unique to them- however, we all cried for Harry in OP because even though we hadn't gone through the shit he had - I've never fought an exceptionally powerful Dark Wizard, have you? - we had felt that frustration, that pain, that utter anguish to some degree in our own lives. Although we may never understand each other, and we may be wrong on both sides, it has never hurt to listen.

That was a little rant, sorry. 

What single people do on Thursday nights:
Drink terrible beer and have a Disney marathon while carving pumpkins. Damn right. 

Anyway. Boyfriends. Puh. Who needs boyfriends when you have Starbucks. 
And, um... Harry. :D"

"event","I thought today was going to be terrible because I didn't have my proposal for my Eng. 308 paper finished, but for some reason, that little voice inside of me said, ""Haleigh - today, it's going to be ok, yea? No stressing."" 
So I went to voice lessons and... there's just been so much progress. There were times with Fowler when I wanted to rip my hair out because I felt stagnant, because I felt like the voice I was singing with belonged to somebody else-

But, Mrs. Hough has ... she's really done something for me. The day I came in asking if she'd go over 'On My Own' from Les Miserables with me for the show, I sang as I used to - big, broadway, full of all the emotion I could summon and after I was finished she said: ""Where did that COME from?"" And I... I just wanted to cry, I was so happy. She told me that somehow, I had developed this idea that singing operatically and singing broadway-style were just two completely different things, but it's just not so. And she's right. Ever since she set me straight, I've... progressed. And I feel comfortable. And my voice feels... lovely. 

French class was wonderful, because Colleen sent me to Greece. Don't ask. 

Before Eng 308 began, I felt a vague rush of panic. I really have been STUCK on a paper topic for the past week - Dr. DeRochi's last one drained me, I think. However, I ate lunch, contemplated it, and decided that I'd let it be. I got to class- and class was wonderful today. She wasn't upset about the proposal. Then she left the room talking to be about it, and I left HER because I saw Dr. Bird's door open. And I squealed in delight and dove into his room and we talked about Halloween and cookies and laughed loudly and - he's just the most amazing person. 

Art History was - I MADE AN A- ON MY TEST. OH. MY. GOD. I ALMOST CRIED, SO HAPPY. yeah, I was really stoked - she just had trouble reading my handwriting - AGAIN - but then, I was reeeally rushed towards the end. 

And and and ... WOOF HALLOWEEN PARTY. Ya'll, I can not express HOW MUCH I LOVE WOOF. It's such a fun, intelligent group, and no one wants to beat the next person up over politics, and everyone feels welcome, and it's just bright and happy AND GRYFFINDOR (MY GROUP) won pictionary (against the Dainty Darwins). Hell YEAH we did. And we had a Halloween Quiz that Dr. Bird was making sarcastic comments on the whole time - it was hysterical. And then we watched the SNL Vice-Presidential Debate. 
Quotes of the night:
Girl: ""CANDY BAR WRAPPER!"" 
Girl: ""TOOTSIE ROLL WRAPPER?!""
Haleigh: ""CONDOM?"" 

Haleigh: *wearing a spider ring* ""I'm engaged to a creepy mother fucker."" 
Dude dressed as the Joker (my new FREM): ""Cheap one too.""
Markie: ""(_Haleigh's ex-boyfriend_)?"" 
Haleigh: ROFL. 

YEEEAA. I'm on a BIG sugar-high right now. Anyway, I'm really glad I got attend atleast ONE Halloween party. YAAAY. So much fun."

"event","Ok, I'm starting to feel the weight of school upon my shoulders. It's probably the first semester that I haven't dropped out of a class because I was lazy or failed because I kept skipping. I'm pretty proud of myself. And although I've made quite a few As, I get the sickening feeling that for the most part my grade report at the end of the semester is going to be packed full of Bs. Fucking plus/minus grading scale. I shouldn't be upset about it, but I really, really wanted to bring up my GPA this semester. However, now I'm certain that I'm graduating late, I have plenty of time to get up to where I need to be. 

My advisor has this HYSTERICAL idea at I'm going to be a teacher one day - when I'm old and gray, certainly, but I'm definitely not going to spend the rest of my young life in a classroom. I'm seriously considering going into editing or publishing - but of course I need some kind experience in marketing, and the thought of it as a minor kinda makes me nauseated. What I didn't tell my advisor is that I want to be a writer, but any english major who tells their teacher that they want to FEED THEMSELVES FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES BY WRITING BOOKS (<--me) is bound to get laughed at. Some of THESE teachers have been working on their great american novel for a bajillion years now. 

I'm looking for a job right now - but, one of my worst fears? Waitressing. I used to be inspired by the waitresses at the little Italian restaurant Dad, Matt, and I used to go to in Augusta and how sweet and warm they were. I told my Dad and brother that my first job would be waitressing! They laughed hysterically at the idea of me carrying huge trays of food without dropping it on myself or the customers, and I thought...""Oh. Right.""

But that's silly, and I'm sure I could do it, just fine. But I NEED a job. I've applied at every bookstore and Starbucks I could - I would love to work at a Starbucks, however, that understands my schedule as a student is flighty. 

Anyway, as for writing, I'm really stoked about NaNoWriMo, and I have the basic plot down in my head - I just wonder if it's ridiculous. BUT, it's all fun and games really. :D 

<small>PLEASE OH PLEASE LET ME DO THIS RIGHT</small> 

Btw, I'm missing Halloween. Did I tell you guys that already? Yeah, yeah. I'm missing it so I can take a six hour road trip to VA for my Uncle's wedding. I told my mom we should AT LEAST stop at like, five houses on the way. Big ones. That have the MAX-ULTRA-PREMIUM-SIZED candy bars. 

It's just odd. Around this time of year I'm stressing over pumpkin carving and costumes. 

._. I'll miss you a lot, Halloween."

"event","Every now and then, Haley and I reflect upon our natures, tear out our flaws and stare at them until we either cry or write something epic to focus our anger. Or try to change them. Anyway, so we were reading our natal charts. This is just one small piece we were talking about - as for Dr. Fike, he's my new advisor. 

Ichi Yume (2:24:38 AM):	7 Sextile Neptune - Pluto

-4 Opposition Neptune - Ascendant

She is very easily influenced and fragile. She suffers disappointments.
Haley:	me too.
Haley:	when did we get to be fragile?
Haley:	see, (___) and (___) are fragile. actually fragile.
Haley:	that's why they act so tough.
Ichi Yume (2:25:10 AM):	Wanting people to like us - or maybe, moreso, what we do.
Haley:	we...aloof it all away.
Ichi Yume (2:25:34 AM):	I nearly cried in Dr. Fike's office-  but I aloof'd it.
Ichi Yume (2:25:39 AM):	Was nonchalant.
Ichi Yume (2:25:51 AM):	When I was talking about my love for literature.
Ichi Yume (2:26:09 AM):	As soon as I sat down across from I realized that he knew I've changed my major three times now.
Ichi Yume (2:26:22 AM):	And there was nothing i could do to prove that passion except ACT upon it.
Ichi Yume (2:26:37 AM):	He may never see it- others will. There's nothing I can do except reach for the moon and pray for the best.
Ichi Yume (2:27:03 AM):	I told him my story - how I loved literature so much I was pretty much terrified of failing at it. In that half-laughing way, you know? :-D
Ichi Yume (2:27:31 AM):	The Aquarius-in-Mercury brushes it off way. But I wanted to break down into tears and tell him how TERRIFIED I WAS at failing.
Ichi Yume (2:28:10 AM):	All eyes are on me. My family's. My friends'. The girl who can write an essay in three hours and make an A. What does that mean in the long run? Absolutely nothing. It's an essay, not a novel.
Ichi Yume (2:29:17 AM):	I don't mean to bring in my beliefs into this but... I think that's one of the reasons I'm atheist. This is IT. This is ALL I have. There is no reward after this life - there is only reward in what I bring to myself, here, in this world.
Ichi Yume (2:29:23 AM):	No one to shake my hand at the end of it all.
Ichi Yume (2:29:39 AM):	I'm doing this for myself, for the people I love, who love me.
Ichi Yume (2:30:43 AM):	I believe in the power of the human spirit. I believe it creates miracles. That's why, even though I don't believe he was the son of a god, I think Jesus was a pretty incredible dude- He did, afterall, have his moon in aquarius and ascendant in capricorn.
Ichi Yume (2:31:05 AM):	...Sorry, I blabbed. Gonna make some tea! :-D 

No, but really. (Haley is a Christian so I don't bring it up much - she is VERY open-minded, don't get me wrong.) 

But it's true. This is IT. I think I may have posted on this before, but after Dr. Bird's presentation on Ingersoll-

I would rather live and love where death is king than have eternal life where love is not.
Robert Green Ingersoll

Surely there is grandeur in knowing that in the realm of thought, at least, you are without a chain; that you have the right to explore all heights and depth; that there are no walls nor fences, nor prohibited places, nor sacred corners in all the vast expanse of thought.
Robert Green Ingersoll 

- At WOOF (Winthrop Organization of Freethinkers, which I am a proud founder of), I felt I needed to write it out again, to put my feelings SOMEWHERE. 

<lj-cut text=""I am an ATHEIST"">

I am an ATHEIST and it is not because I hate religion. I don't think overnight anyone could, or even should, try to extinguish the fires of religion. They couldn't, because of how <i>deep</i> the ancient roots of religion reach and how much it has to do with cultures around the world and the traditions people have based their lives to revolve around. They shouldn't, because most people in the world today NEED something they can cling to, something that will give them hope, because sometime, a long time ago, someone must have said that human reason wasn't enough, that we couldn't trust a man to hold true to his own morals and ethics, because this beautiful spirituality, this love we feel when we're submerged in nature, when we're in the circle of our families and friends, couldn't possibly have been born from <i>us</i> - we seem so insignificant. It's sad, but true. Should people realize tomorrow that there is no god, there would be mass chaos, because people would sink into despair, would think that all their goodness has been for naught. (That was so clumsily written, but this is a blurb, not an essay.)

How wrong they would be. 

We don't need any deities to make us the wonderful, beautiful species that we are. Love was born of us, solely of us - and we are truly <i>great</i> because we have the capacity to reason, to love. People belittle themselves, in a way, by believing in a god! Oh, we don't <i>need</i> any god to survive. The world is chaotic, it is absurd at times, but we have our choices and we have the ability to shape the world into what we want it to be, to shape ourselves into who we want to be - and isn't that a beautiful thing in itself, that we are the artists of this great portrait of our lives? Darlings, we are god-like, creators of our own worlds! 

All the mysterious and miracles of this world were created of us, except those that were born of Nature, and many of those we can understand through science. 

I used to sleep with a Bible under my pillow in middle school, crying to myself and thinking that Satan might take a liking to me or something because I was somehow crazy and sinful for questioning God, until one day I just stepped out of the fog, and the world seemed... HUGE. And it was frightening, standing on the edge of that vast abyss of life and realizing... 

It's all on me. In the end, if you're running out of breath and panicking and saying, ""Is this it? Is this all? I need more time, I'm not finished-"" you've failed no one but yourself. There are no golden streets of heaven- and honestly there is no place I would rather NOT live, could you IMAGINE the boredom? There is no afterlife. I'd like to believe that we have a chance to be reborn, but my reason shakes it's head at even that idea. You create your heaven or hell in this world. 

So this is what we have. And, following my existential beliefs, existence precedes essence - we shape our essence. We always have a choice. If one chooses to think that they're living for nothing after realizing this - so be it; he made the choice to sink into a pit of despair without thinking it through. We must take responsibility for our actions, we must, in Saint Exupery's words, take responsibility for that which we have tamed (friends, family, etc.). In the end, however, taking responsibility for our actions can be quite rewarding. At the end we can say: ""I DID THIS. ALL ME. MY SIGNATURE."" 

I do believe we have souls. I can't feel any god, but I feel my soul. I feel the activeness of my spirit. When - oh god, I'm a hippie - I'm a part of nature, I feel something come alive that I can't explain in scientific terms. When I meet someone, it could be their chemicals that attract me, or it could be that there's something deeper within us that wishes us to look closer. I think we feel it during moments of passion - really good moments :D - when heaven splits open. I Love- and there is no greater miracle, no greater proof of the human soul than Love. 

Oh, and it's quite reasonable to Love. Fewer people get hurt, for one. 

I think one day the fires of religion may turn to only embers, but a day far from now, when it has been convinced to all mankind that we can live by rules we, ourselves, set for ourselves, that the morals we give ourselves can be held steady by our reason, that we do need a government but not because any deity said so, but that because we realized it to be in our best interests. We can still be humble and find pride in the fact that we are <i>human</i> - it's not impossible. I assure you, people like Robert Ingersoll were humble and good and righteous without a god - there is living proof of atheists who love just as deeply as the next theist, who donate to charities, who are tolerant and loving, who vote, who raise their children on the idea that there is always Hope, because there is always tomorrow, because we, children, <i>we</i> have the power 
to change the world, to save the world. 

And if you're ever feeling insignificant in this very large world, you remember that the person nearest to you and the person farthest from you has felt - not the same, no, never the same - but equal sorrow, grief, happiness, love, that you have, and that they've had nightmares and shivered in fear just as they've fallen in love, kissed in romantic places, and had their hearts broken- 
""You're an interesting species. An interesting mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares. You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you're not. See, in all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other."" - Contact

But at the same time, if you are true to yourself, you will make your mark on this world, you will find your own immortality.

People ask me what I believe in, and I tell them, ""I believe in Love, and the power of the human spirit."" And it's true, I blush and stammer, and people end up thinking I'm naive and that I probably still collect My Little Ponies and watch The Last Unicorn - well, so I do. But Mrs. Shuford said that it was just fine, and - you know what? 
It's worked out alright for me so far. 
</lj-cut>


Love is the only bow on life's dark cloud.
It is the Morning and the Evening Star.
It shines upon the cradle of the babe,
and sheds its radiance upon the quiet tomb.
It is the mother of Art,
inspirer of poet, patriot, and philosopher.
It is the air and light of every heart, builder of every home,
kindler of every fire on every hearth.
It was the first to dream of immortality.
It fills the world with melody,
for Music is the voice of Love.
Love is the magician, the enchanter,
that changes worthless things to joy,
and makes right royal kings and queens of common clay.
It is the perfume of the wondrous flower -- the heart
and without that sacred passion, that divine swoon,
we are less than beasts;
but with it, earth is heaven
and we are gods.

"event","Today, someone I know was just immortalized in someone else's memory.

I should like to be immortalized in someone's memory. I think... that should be one of the biggest goals in peoples lives. We're always told to live for the moment, to develop an essence, to make something of ourselves with the time we're given. But I would love for a moment to immortalized in someone's mind because... because of me. That I did something, and not something mean or cruel, but something truly good. Maybe even something romantic - but in the way you're thinking. Maybe ... maybe just SOMETHING. I remember this time with Katie, after AWA, when we were lost in the mountains and I pulled over by a river so we could go down and play on the boulders. And she was sifting through the water to find pretty rocks... I just wanted to burst into tears beside her and hug her for hours, because she that sincere, that beautiful, and she was my friend. 

My brother's foot will always be immortalized, from the time we woke up on Christmas morning having BOTH slept on the couch (the house was PACKED) - his foot was RIGHT IN MY FACE. STINKING. I smacked it and whined for like, five minutes, until he woke up. 

Or the moment I met Haley and we quietly HATED each other until one of us said ""sneers furrily."" And the world tilted upside down. 

Or Mitch's face when he saw me when I walked through the door of the icecream parlor - hell, that whole day with him is immortalized in mine. No, nothing came out of that... and sometimes I still feel sick over it. Especially when he IMs me, oblivious of how my fingers are paralyzed above the keys, my mind shot of words and ideas. Hey, Mitch? You're immortalized, you stupid punk. 

All these beeeeautiful moments. Anyway, I'm glad I have them."

Every pang of that pulsing muscle threatening to explode from my chest wanted to justify against all reason that you were a cold, callous bitch who only wanted to see me crash and burn. I can still hear that voice, two hours later, screaming at you. You're bipolar, short-fused, and opinionated as hell. A sour part in me says I'm better than you, even if you are fifty times more experienced in life and literature than I. No, I'm NOT afraid to say the word 'pedophile' and disagree with you entirely. You're the worst kind of Gemini - entirely two-faced, ill-intentions lacquered over with gentle smiles and sweet tones. You get defensive right when someone takes a viewpoint that is in opposition to yours, and then you don't let it go. FUCK. YOU. You're the kind of person who forgets what it's like to be young, to be in college, to stress over rent, food, gas, grades, getting to class on time when your printer jams and your black ink runs out, all while trying to stand on your own two feet without having to call your parents begging for money, scraping the last of your pride off your bones. 

... that's what the stuuupid fdlfs immature child inside me was crying, atleast.

It was only that strange, cold, objective, detached, part of me that forced me up, that made me look her in the eyes with a placid expression, that saved me from losing the adult in me. 

By the time I hit Art History I was close to tears of pure fury, balancing my coffee and pastry, half-starved because I'd hadn't had time for lunch, teeth digging into my chapped lips while I furiously fought against my melting pride. I wrote pathetic, bitter things (""I hate myself today :D"") while I took notes, slowly loosening up as I wrote stupid comments, realizing that I'm not a lesbian because I couldn't take my eyes off the penises on the statues, and that Greeks were unusually good at sculpting toes, and how uncomfortable it must have been to throw a discus in the nude. And somehow, Dr. Derkson's calm voice washed over me, full of love for this architecture, or this sculpture, or the story in the frieze. She showed us a picture once of two of her art teachers - ""This one,"" she said, with a small nostalgic smile, ""hated my guts. I made Cs in his class. But this one,"" she then pointed to the other man in the photo, ""gave me all As."" 

And I wondered, had she ever been beaten like I had? There's is nothing worse than feeling like you're losing your grip on something you love, and that it's entirely your fault. Because you didn't do that reading, complete that homework, write a response...

Because you were late to class. 

She wasn't giving me what I wanted, and I realized that's why I was being so childish. I was late and she said that this was the last straw. Mrs. Shuford never punished me for it. Dr. Belk never punished me for it. Dr. Bird handed me the role to sign when I came in ten minutes late with a coffee and snack in tow. Why? Because I had participated- because they knew I had full respect for them and the subject at hand, that I could be counted on to know the material, that I loved what I read. I was spoiled.

It is entirely my fault that I was late. I am perpetually late-  everyone who knows me knows this, and I'm clearly still having trouble fixing the problem. I don't know what to do about it... In a way I want to curl up and pout and cry and pitch a fit, but I know now I'll just have to dig my heels into the ground and bear her rules. To have cried would have meant that I just gave in to the person whom everyone <i>expected</i> me to give in to.

I know I bruise easily, I know, but I'm not fragile. I know I have miserable self-esteem, but I know how to stand on my own two feet when I'm challenged and get up when I'm pushed down. I'm spoiled, fuck yes, and I can be haughty and snobby as hell, but I have passion - real, deep passion for literature. I have just as much, if not more, passion than her. I can't be a child about this - I have to be an adult, I have to come out on top. I've got to do it alone. I've come this far alone, and I have to prove to everyone now what I can be. I have to do this. 

The first step is just... the hardest.

"event","I feel pretty awful for having asked Haley yesterday to go shoe shopping with me today because she was so tired from work this morning, but we lucked out and I happened to fall in love with the third pair we looked at (to which Haley said, ""Hey thar Alice"" and I beamed and then tripped all over myself). Then while I pranced around in them and helped a little girl pick out a pair of boots (?!), Haley checked out a few shoes of interest for herself. We left pretty quickly - she was dead on her feet.

The mall was curiously soothing today. Quite a bit of my growing-up took place in Pineville, so the Carolina Place Mall always pulls up a strong feeling of nostalgia in me - of Santa Claus and that one restaurant Dad would take little versions of Matt and me to. A McAllister's now sits in its place, but it is most certainly an acceptable replacement. I bought Haley lunch and a latte for her kind services and had a hot cocoa for myself. 

I have never felt Halloween in the air so strongly. It's EATING at me for some reason, as though I'm on the verge of something fantastic. The trees seem to have changed early this year, and the scent of burning leaves and pumpkin spice seem to follow me everywhere I go - things that remind me of graveyards, Neil Gaiman, Katie, ouija boards, and Halloweens that I always wanted and never had. I want to carve a pumpkin and curl up in a ball to watch Halloween movies every night for a week, munching out of bags of candy, tell ghost stories by bonfires and then fall asleep with the scent of burnt marshmallows clinging to my hair. 

These daydreams leave an aching pit in my stomach when I'm riding down a country road with a hot cocoa between my hands, listening to A Fine Frenzy, watching the red and gold boughs of the trees fly by overhead....

 I feel deliciously pagan; the harvest cometh, and all of Nature paves her roads with gold to await Demeter, grim and glorious."

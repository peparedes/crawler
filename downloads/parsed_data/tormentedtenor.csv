"event","I am becoming stronger by the day. Tears are scarce and bad memories fade into the blackness down here beneath the stage. She is gone.... I have accepted that, and intend to block her out completely. Of course I will miss her beaming smiles and her melodic voice....but she is a Human nonetheless...and Humans were an Alien race to me...something I could never grasp.

My music is flourishing...good music that He Himself would be proud of, had he not turned his back on me. Perhaps it was I who turned away...it matters not.

I am quite exhausted and need to find rest. This is so simple for Them...but not for me....for in that sleep what dreams may come..."

"event","Oh, she spoke to me. She spoke to me after such a silence...and I hadn't even approached her in the slightest. My heart dropped into my stomach and tears filled my eyes. We discussed life and the sadness of internal sorrows. How I longed to have my words of longing and the burn of my tormented existance without her escape from my being, but alas, the fear of my heart bursting from the pressure of love upon it made me suck it in and allow the tears to run freely down my hollow sockets as I simply replied ""I'm fine.""
Human beings are very desolate creatures. Even though I don't include myself in that section of mortal life...or aren't allowed to call myself such, is more like it...sometimes I want nothing than to have someone take my grotesque face in their hands and smile lovingly at me. Then the tears fall again, for such a distorted dream shatters the soul... and leaves the heart in pieces upon the stone floor of my empty existance..."

Yet all you really wanted<br>was to be understood, and be more than a masked<br>phantasm to a world that cursed you and shunned<br>you so that you ended up living in a basement<br>alone with your music for eternity.  That is,<br>until the day one little Flutter Pony learned<br>to look beyond the mask and love you for you.

"event","Too many times I awake in the dark of the night crying out to an invisible soul. To whom it belongs, I haven't the slightest inkling. This black haven of melancholy and rage is not befitting of such another for whom I yearn. This mask I wear does not hurt my physical self any longer...those scars have ceased to burn and bleed...no, all that occurs now is the daily burden my heart carries. That fear and sickening feeling I get every time I pass one of my grand mirrors. The nervousness I get inside of me whenever I have to take it off, for fear some unknown being is there within my shadows. I have found myself composing a lullaby of sorts...not even stopping to dictate it...I just hear it inside of me and there it is. Within my very soul.


No one would listen
No one but her
Heard as the outcast hears.

Shamed into solitude
Shunned by the multitude
I learned to listen
In my dark, my heart heard music

I long to teach the world
Rise up and reach the world
No one would listen
I alone could hear the music

Then, at last, a voice in the gloom
Seemed to cry ""I hear you""
I hear your fears
Your torment and your tears

She saw my loneliness
Shared in my emptiness
No one would listen
No one but her
Heard as the outcast hears

No one would listen
No one but her
Heard as the outcast hears..."

"event","Alone in this darkness there are times when I weep just at the sound of the silence that envelops me and holds me hostage. All too many times I have bled just for the sake of watching the crimson tears pour down my pasty skin...just to know I'm here. At times I feel lost in a never-ending nightmare that swirls inside me.  That is when the dark power of my music pours out of me; taking me down with it and tearing me apart-body and soul. I wish for nothing but release...either physically or spiritually. Yet I do not believe in God...so perhaps Spiritual is the wrong word. If it were not for the melancholy beauty of my masterpiece...I would care no more if I were part of this mortal coil.

One speaks of pain
What does thee know of pain,
One speaks of suffering
What does the know of Suffering,
One speaks of torment
What does thee know of torment,
One speaks of death
What does thee know of death,
One speaks of waste
What does thee know of waste,
One speaks of eternal darkness
What does thee know of eternal darkness,
One say come burn with me
I burn for Thee
Thee knows none of what thee speaks
For thee casts all unto me.

"event","Too many sleepless nights I lay thinking of my past; the mistakes and the many regrets I hold deep within me. Even though my better judgement tells me that I need to move along with life...I really cannot express my feeling of despair in it all. What life do I proceed with...when all I want is gone? There is such a void inside of me that cries out each day for the soul of another, but alas, I know it will never be. Too many times I have played my music and I could hear her words enveloping me as the notes swirled about my head. At times it was more than I could bear. Yet now...I have a stange feeling of hatred and loathing of her...that  feel is easier to accomplish than anything else I wish. Putting her out of my mind as much as possible, I suddenly realized how much I had been depriving my music. Then after developing such a horrid cough for two weeks, I had no solace in singing; as that you must NEVER sing when you have a sore throat... until yesterday, when I finally permitted myself to a song. My voice rose against the swarming dissonance in the music and for the first moment in some time... I lost myself again. It was the most glorious feeling in world. I now long for the passsion in the notes, the stories in those words...and deep within the night they call to me once more...and I am content..."

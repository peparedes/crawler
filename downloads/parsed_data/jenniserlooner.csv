This weekend out of the blue my twins, Chris & Peter, signed with Sodertalje Sportklubb.  <i>Another reason why I hate the NHL lockout!!</i>  I was just getting over the thought that they might play in Halifax with the WHA...but Sweden.  That is so far away and I won't be able to get to see them play.  Not to mention the language barrier.  I have only found three websites that has the news about them being signed and unfortunately two of them are in Swedish, grr.  The only good news is that I was able to find an forum that has some Swedish members who might be able to translate."

I also found out that we aren't going to have Rookie Camp.  I am a little disappointed but I guess this is another sign pointing to a definite lockout :("

The boy working in that department told him that they only sold whole heads of lettuce.  
The man was insistent that the boy ask his manager about the matter.  
Walking into the back room, the boy said to the manager, ""Some a$$hole wants to buy half a head of lettuce.""  
As he finished his sentence, he turned to find the man standing right behind him, so he added, ""and this gentleman kindly offered to buy the other half.""  
The manager approved the deal, and the man went on his way.

We like people who think on their feet here. Where are you from, son?""

I was really worried because mom and dad are building an apartment for Jes downstairs and I was sure Isabel was going to hit us really hard like the past 3 hurricanes.  I was expecting the water to come up really high and destroy the new appliances and cabinets but we were lucky and the storm was blowing the water away from the house, so there was no high water like I expected.  I hope we are this lucky with future hurricanes.

"event","Saturday <lj user=""Thelmie""> and I went to the mall and Target.  On our way there I saw a corvette in my rear view mirror.  I said, ""Hey Thelmie, isn't that your year?""  It looked like it was primed but when it got closer it was all glittery.  Not meta;lic, glittery!!  The only way to describe it is like popcorn ceiling mixed with large chunks of glitter and bondo.  It was horrible....it also had gills.  We couldn't help laughing hysterically, it was the worst thing I have ever seen done to a corvette.  Mine isn't in good shape, doesn't run but at least the paint job looks ok.  This one was a disgrace to all corvettes.

I woke up this morning around 3:30 am and couldn't get back to sleep so I watched Trading Spaces for a little while.  I love that show, if only I was that crafty and had a sense of design.  I finally got to bed around 5:30am only to wake up at 8:45.  I got up and got ready for church.  There is a church right down the street and I have only been there once since I moved so I felt guilty about not going often.  I got my lazy butt out of bed and got ready and went to church.  It wasn't bad but it was not like my old church, they did things in a totally different way and sang almost everything.  

When I got home I made myself some Swedish pancakes and coffee.  All was good, I was thinking about going to the pool and read my book but it was just too hot for that.  So I rocked in my rocker on the porch and read.  I am so glad the painters are done painting my building.  My parents gave me the rockers for my birthday but have been unable to use them because they started painting the building and told us to take all of our stuff off the porch.  I have only been able to put everything back to normal this week.  So I spent most of my day out there, rocking and reading.  How relaxing, what a way to end my weekend.  

Tomorrow I am getting my hair cut.  I am not sure what I want to do but I am tired of it.  It has gotten so long that it won't curl anymore.  I think I am going to tell the hairdresser just to do whatever he wants to do...as long as he doesn't shave my head or cut it too short.  Thelmie recommended these hairdressers and says they are good so hopefully he won't screw up my hair."

Last week she emailed me asking me if I wanted to join the team.  I just received an email saying that there wasn't any interest in summer ice time for the Trailblazers so I was happy to hear there was room on her team for players.  

I was very nervous about tonight's game.  I haven't played in two months and I only skated once during that time.  Most of the women on the teams were from the Trailblazers, that made me feel better.  They know how bad I suck so there wasn't much pressure to perform ;)

Well I totally impressed myself.  I out skated some of the girls on the previous team, took my place right in front of the net and was in the opposing teams way.  I had a bunch of shots on goal and two really good chances.  Close but not close enough :(  I wasn't really good but I played, by far, my best game tonight.  I got a +2 and we had a shutout, 5-0!  

I can't wait until next game.  The only down side is that we have back to back games.  I will have to prepare for it and run everyday for the next week, ready for the running TeddyCat?!!?"

Thus, ""jenniser looner"" is 59227.


Subtract 5781 from the number - this is the year first newspaper cartoon strip was published, written backwards. It gives 53446. 

Turn the number backwards, divide by 7 - the sacred number of Illuminati. The number is now 9205. 

Multiply it by 3, the symbol of fulfillment - the number is now 27615. 

Divide by 21, the symbol of the greater sin - the result is 1315. 

Add 661 to it - this is the year Roman Empire was devastated by a plague, written backwards - you will get 1976. 

The number 1976 is the year George Harrison performed the lumberjack song with Monty Python - if you have seen it, you should understand. 

This clearly proves how evil the subject is. QED.

There was this scene where Neo fights a bunch of clones, most of the time it looked like the actors were really doing the stunts but there were parts of it where you knew it was computer generated.  It looked like a computer game instead of live action film. I know it isn't supposed to be realistic but it should look realistic.  

<i>What is with the attack of the clones theme?  Star Wars Episode 2 was of course called Attack of the Clones, The Matrix Reloaded has the John Smith clones and now Terminator 3 is going to have machine clones that attack.  Don't these people come up with any original plots?!</i>

The ship docking scene was another part of the movie that didn't make sense.  The mission control people were all dressed in white and  in this bright white high tech room.  But Zion was dark, dirty and the people walked around with little clothes and were barefooted.  

Other than that the rest of the movie was good.  Good music, visuals, and fight scenes.  I did enjoy all the fights, there were soo many.  My two favorite fights were the foyer scene with all the weapons and the highway chase.  I also liked how Neo flew.  He would bear down and the ground would ripple then he would shoot off."

Not only did today's invoice had the credit for the 7 hours but charged me for all the extra hours that they didn't charge me for in the past.  I am guessing my service has 20 free hours.  So I have a charge on my account for $40.00!!  What idiots!

"event","I am in <b>pain!</b>  Yesterday I went walking with <lj user=""TeddyCat"">.  The trail was beautiful, shaded and had a stream that followed the route.  We walked 4 miles which isn't that bad.  (I am used to doing 3.5 on the elliptical)  What got me was I was still in pain from Monday's hockey practice/house game.  

My house league team was shorthanded again so we only had 2 lines of forwards and 3 defense women.  By the end of the third period I could barely lift my legs to get over the boards.  It was horrible.  I thought it was because I am in bad shape but then again I think anyone would be tired because of the lack of players.   I can never complain about not getting enough ice time ;-)

So my thighs and glutinous maximums muscles were sore before the 4 mile walk and by the end they were burning.  Today I don't want to walk!  I have to be good though so I won't do the trail but I will go to the gym and see how much I can do on the elliptical."

Tonight <lj user=""TeddyCat"">, <lj user=""stevetcg"">, Anne and I went to a Durham Bulls game.  This was the first time I have been to a DB game so I was excited.  We got tickets in the second row right off of the third base.  <img src=""http://www.aaronward.com/images/bulls/bats.jpg"" border=""1"" align=""right"">  It was crazy.  I didn't realize that we were going to be right there.  What was unnerving was the small wall between us and the field.  We didn't have any glass like hockey to protect us from flying balls/bats.  I had to keep my eyes out for flying balls.  During the first inning someone broke a bat and it went flying into the section right next to us.  Anne also got hit in the head with a baseball later in the game.  She was ok because the guy in front of us slowed it down with his glove.  Thank God!

<img src=""http://www.aaronward.com/images/bulls/sean.jpg"" border=""1"" align=""left""> 
Our seats were also located right where the away team's pitchers and catchers warm up. Boy were the guys cute. TeddyCat and I, well mostly TeddyCat, took pictures.  It was so cool because the guys knew we were taking their pictures and posed for us.  It was great, Mike was putting bunny ears and wings over his teammates head, classic. Then they joined the crowd in doing the wave and dancing to the YMCA song.  I don't think Stevetcg was happy with us taking so many pictures. Sorry Stevetcg.
  
<img src=""http://www.aaronward.com/images/bulls/mike.jpg"" border=""1"" align=""right"">
During the game we heckled the guys while trying to take their pictures.  We were so close and there was no barrier between us so the guys could hear.  When one player passed us TeddyCat started singing ""You Sexy Thing"".  She is sooo crazy!  While Mike was warming up or keeping himself busy, whatever you want to call it, there were these drunk college student yelling something at him.  Mike responds with, ""Your mom called.  She said the tire is flat on your house you need to go home and change it!""  OMG it was too funny!

Next game we need to go and get seats at the other side of the ball park so we can actually see out players not the visitors.  Even thought the visitors tonight were fun!"

"event","Tonight I came to a realization that people aren't who they seem to be.  You think you really know a person then all of a sudden you don't.  They seem to be ashamed of you and don't want to be seen around you.  They think that their reputation is in jeopardy by hanging out with you.  Little do they know that it is them that is destroying their own reputation.  Take a look in the mirror and look at what YOU are doing before you start pointing fingers at other people and blaming them for YOUR problems!!  I feel very used.  Used like rung in a ladder on the way to the top of the social circle.  It is really sad because I really like them and it is upsetting that they feel this way about me.   I don't open up to too many people and then when I do and find out I am wrong about them it makes it harder to let new people in.  I thought I was a better judge of character but obviously I am not as good as I thought."

"event","<lj user=""QueenMerry"">'s and my team won our game tonight, 2-1. WOOHOO!!  I got two shots on goal and I ended the game with a -1.  Ok I never said I was any good but hey I love the game!!!!  By the end of the day I thought I was going to die.  It is due to my lack of exercise and going to practice.  I definitely have to get back to the gym or I will die of a heart attack!

Practice was good.  We worked on our breakouts and how to violate each other along the boards.  It was lots of fun.  EC was there tonight.  There was a girl in the locker room that was going on how the 'Canes suck and everything. She wasn't being evil or anything.  I didn't like it because I feel protective of our guys, I know call me crazy!  It might have been because EC was there and I just think it wasn't right to say that in front of her....but I am sure she agrees that they are sucking too.

It is 12:14 and I am rearing to go...that is what practice does to me.  I feel like I could run 5 miles, even though I know I can't ;-)  I have to get to sleep but I can't.  Damn adrenaline!"

Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather impulsive personality; a natural leader, who's quick to make decisions, though not always the right ones. They see you as bold and adventuresome, someone who will try anything once; someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure. They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement you radiate. </td></tr></table>

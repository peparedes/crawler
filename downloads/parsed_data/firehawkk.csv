"event","I have a little bit of time before I have to go to school, so I figure I'll update on the things that have been going on lately.  We've actually been rather busy, and it's kind of strange to think that everything has occured in a short week period.  Lately, it seems I've been spending every waking minute with Adam, Heidi and Alex...which is absolutely wonderful.  I'm sure that'll change more or less once we all have schoolwork to worry about, but for the moment we've been attached at the hip.  I'm not sure I've ever really had friends that close before.

Okay, onto events.  Wednesday, Adam, Alex, Heidi and I had a date with Tim from Long Island to play some NHL 2007 preseason games (because we are ridiculous, and are in a rather competitive online hockey tournament...such dorks!), so we met up early to get some dinner and hang out.  We went to Casey's, where we learned that we are all WAY too loud for our own good (""YOU THINK HE'S GAY??"").  Sometime mid-way during the meal, Adam divulged the fact that we weren't playing JUST Tim...Schramm, Phil and Sean were also going over Tim's house, and Bo and his brother Zac were also going to be playing a few games.  It was a good time.  I got to talk to Tim, Schramm and Phil via the little headset thing (though they were messing with my head and switching the headset around so I didn't know who I was talking to), and unfortunately I lost every game I played.  :-(  But hopefully I'll get better at this game thing, and that'll change.  :-)

Thursday was Family Dinner night...the very best night there is.  :-D  Heidi, Alex and I went over to Adam's early to help prepare the food, which was going to consist of steak and red potatoes.  We also brought two bottles of red and a bottle of white wine, which was mostly drunk by Heidi and I.  Heidi ended up getting smashed at that point in the night, though I was fine.  Adam ended up accidentally CHARCOALING the damn steak, because he read the directions wrong and set it at 425 degrees when the recipe called for 325.  It tasted okay, though a bit burnt...but the red potatoes were heavenly, and everyone was fighting over them.  Somewhere during the night, Kace sponteneously showed up.

Then Becky and Hillari decided to beg us to go out with them to Shamrocks, since it was 18+ night.  After some convincing, we all decided to go.  Alex, Heidi and I drove home to consolidate into one car and get changed, and then we met back up at Adam's to head over there.  The bar itself was okay, but as Heidi pointed out, there were no attractive guys for her to hit on.  Then Becky decided to drag Heidi and I out onto the dance floor (the shot of soco and lime that I had may have helped), where we danced for a good hour or so.  We were the only ones out there for a LONG time...but it was fun none the less, and I think I actually did okay.  Adam and Kace left early, Alex sat and watched, Heidi accomplished her goal of getting a guy to buy her a drink, some guys bought us an entire tray of jello shots, some guy turned down my offer to dance, and I got somewhat hit on by the bouncer who thought I was only 18.  Yeah.  Good times.

I need a break.  :-)  I'll catch up on the weekend later."

"event","So, the Colts won the superbowl.  Which is spectacular, because we were rooting for them, for no particular reason.

Heidi got to learn a little bit about football, in hopes that she might someday attract a man.  She also discovered that she likes a guy who is into sports.  Something about the yelling at the screen...

The commercials were pretty good too.  The one about the yellow car robot that lost it's job made both me and Heidi rather emotional, and we were literally saying outloud, ""Nooooo, don't kill yourself!""  We later couldn't figure out the point in it...but it certainly impacted us.  :-)

Later on in the night, I didn't get much sleep, so I was IMing Alex from across the house until about 5:00 AM.  Everything at that time was extremely funny to me, and he could hear me giggling from my room.  :-D

AND, the drama continues.

Oh yeah, I'm missing parts of Saturday.  First time that's ever happened.

QUOTES OF THE DAY:
Adam: (after seeing the commercial with the inside of a Coke machine) They LIE!  I've seen the inside of those things before!

Heidi: Us hitting on Adam is like a dog humping a pillow, just because it's there.
Adam: (carressing a pillow) Can I be a striped one?

Ve: Today in class I accidentally caught a cotton ball on fire, so I yelled ""I have a fire situation going on"", and when no one did anything, I hit it with my book until it went out.  The funniest part was that I literally yelled ""Fire"", and no one reacted!
Adam: Guess you should have yelled ""Rape"""

"event","We should have our own cooking show, Heidi and I.  Not because it would be educational or informative, but because it would be extremely funny.  For our family dinner, we decided to make garlic chicken with red potatoes and corn.  Here's a list of the things that went wrong.

*Heidi wrote down the ingredients for the red potatoes, and then lost the recipe.
*We bought a can of corn, but then realized that we had broken our can opener, so we had to open the corn by punching holes around the edge.  I wish I had a picture of it to share...it's halarious.
*Heidi accidentally broke a glass into our potatoes
*I knocked over a bottle of wine, managed to save most of the wine, but in the process broke the glass I was holding.  Shows where my priorities are.
*Heidi knocked over her wine glass over dinner while gesticulating rather wildly
*Our potatoes were dry becuase we forgot to add olive oil into the mixture

Overall, it was rather entertaining.  Heidi figures that we need to cook while buzzed, because otherwise it is way too stressful for us.  Thankfully, Adam is cooking family dinner NEXT time...I'm sure it will be vastly better.

Oh, and we played some NHL at Adam's later.  Such a fun game."

"event","For my first week back at school, it was a lot of fun.  :-)

There was the car show on Friday, where I got to think about what kind of car I'd like to buy next year, and also where Ken's car wouldn't start.  Luckily we had Kevin on our side, who's a handyman and can fix just about anything.

Then Saturday I spent in Narragansett with Heidi, going ""party hopping""...or rather, hitting up two parties, but that's pretty intense for us.  We went to the Mews with Adam and his friends Tim, Phil (my ""date""), Sean, and Kace for Sean's 21st birthday.  We ordered him a rack of beer to celebrate the occasion, but Adam and I ended up drinking most of it anyways.  I also managed not to recongize Phil, even though I had already met him, and it was at the resteraunt that Heidi decided that he looked like Superman.  (We made him put on fake glasses and tear them off dramatically just to prove it.)

After the Mews we stopped by Adam's house to play some video games and wait until 10, when we planned to go stop by Heidi's friend Casey's house.  We only ended up staying for about a half an hour...and got rather lost tryingn to get there too...because the party was kind of small, and we didn't know very many of the people there.  And most of the action was going on in the basement, where there was beer pong, and it was cold.  After a short visit we headed back to Adam's house, where the video games had stopped, for the most part.  They too were playing beer pong.  A couple of shots later, I was participating, with Phil as my partner, against Kace and Adam.  We were doing awesome at first...but inevidably lost.  Oh well.

At some point or another we all crashed on various couches to watch Jackass II, which now has become one of Heidi's obsessions.  We left shortly after that, though we met up with them the next morning for breakfast at Friendlies.  We watched some Shark show at Adam's house later, and eventually all broke up around 5:00.  The boys (and Kace) had to head back to Long Island (sad :-().

But overall, it was a lot of fun, and I hope those guys come and visit again soon... :-)

Oh, the things I get myself into.

QUOTES OF THE WEEK:
Heidi: You know, welding is sexy.

Veronica: If you put a picture of me on the website, make sure it's a good one!
Adam:  There ARE no good pictures of you, unless it's one where you're taking it!
(Veronica and Heidi laugh hysterically)
Veronica: ...Why would you have pictures of me taking it, Adam?
Adam: ...I meant taking THE PICTURE!!

Veronica: Alternatively, we could eat hamburgers seperately.

Heidi: Usually, I go through girl friends like you go through guys.

Veronica: Nicknames just have to come out of me, like a magical fountain...
Heidi: A magical FART???"

"event","My friends and I are insane.  My girl friends and I, anyways.

Not because we go out and party and are wild.  (That only happens every once in a while.)  No, we are insane because the things that we do for ""fun"" make our parents laugh because it's so ridiculously tame.

Last night for instance.  The night started off at Walmart, doing some back to school shopping.

We progressed to the mall, where we wandered about while Kristin bought some clothes until we met up with Shaina.  Then we sat around on a bench discussing our ""type"" of guys, until we realized that we were being very Sex-and-the-City like.  (I'm Samantha.  Not because I'm a ho, but because, according to my girls, guys apparently like me.)

Then we went to Panera for dinner, where we managed to sit for 2 hours.  Panera made me very happy and giggly though.  It was a very positive atmosphere.

We eventually moved over to our ""hang-out spot"", Borders, to browse books, obviously, and do what else?  Sit around and talk.

Once we got tired of that place, we decided to sit around and talk at the tavern, perhaps in hopes that people would show up and the night would get interesting, but they didn't.  We did hang out with Ryan White though, which is always a plus.

Anyways, half of my friends are leaving to go back to school very soon, so the crazy times may be over for now.

QUOTES OF THE DAY:
Veronica: I hope when you get married that you have a last name LONGER than your last name now...like Stroganofski or something.
Samantha: Samantha Stroganofski!  It works!

Samantha: And here's the receipt for...Chanya?
Veronica: They mis-spelled Shaina?  That has to be her new nickname.

Samantha: Here, we'll split them up.  Shaina can sit on one side, and Kristin will sit on the other.
Veronica: That's step 15 in our ultimate plan to tear them apart.
Samantha: What are the other steps?
Veronica: ...they are so secret, not even I know what they are!"

"event","So New Year's Eve ended up being a lot of fun.  Confusing, yes.  Complicated, yes, but if we didn't make it complicated, well then it just wouldn't be my group of friends.  So maybe we changed plans about a billion times before New Year's Eve...but it turned out well in the end.  :-)

Originally we were going to go to the casino...but the fact that there was a 100 dollar cover charge for all bars and the fact that both casinos were expecting upwards of 10,000 people made us think twice.  We opted to instead stay in at Samantha's house and hang out...which is fine, because we always manage to have fun when all of us get together.

The group was small...just me, Ken, Sam, Kit, Shay, Anj, and Mike (hmmm...Mike is the only one without a nickname) all hanging out in Sam's basement with pizza, chips, chocolate, and a bunch of alcohol (mostly compliments of Ken and I).  Anj was already smashed by the time we got there (at 7:30, silly girl, but I do love her so), and it mostly ended up being me, Sam and Anj drinking at all...Ken and Mike, as per ushe, just had a few drinks, and Kit and Shay barely drank at all.  It was fine though...we all just ended up talking about random things and playing Scene It: TV (which was really hard and only included super old TV shows and we hated it) and Taboo (which was awesome, and I kick ass at that game, and my team totally won both times).

We stayed up until like 3:00, when we all decided to go to sleep...Mike went home, Sam crashed in her bed upstairs, Shay slept on the floor, Anj and Kit took the pull out couch, and Ken and I squeezed on a one-person blow up couch...it was very reminscent of my junior year in the old house, where me and Ken nightly slept on my twin-sized bed.  :-D  We ate donuts and chatted extensively in the morning, and Ken and I left by 2:00 so we could come home and hang out with Kevin (who we did see) and Christina (who we didn't).

QUOTES OF THE DAY:
Shaina: I used to run into this girl on campus all the time and I didn't really know her, but for some reason she always invited me out, and I kept giving excuses...so eventually, I ran out of excuses...so one day, she said, ""Hey do you want to go to happy hour?"" and I said, ""Sorry, I have to go to a civil-war re-enactment...""

Kristin: (during Taboo...her word being ""waddle"") Like shaina!
Samantha: Waddles like Shaina??

Samantha: When my roommate was drunk once, she called me ""an amazing sunburst"""

"event","So maybe this week and weekend have been hectic, and maybe yesterday was the first day I got to sit still for the first time in a while.  And maybe I have no more money because of gas, food, parties, and other important things.  But man...it was a fun week.  I actually got out and did stuff.  And hung out with friends.  Which makes me happy.

The craziness started on Thursday, when I drove to meet Ken and Nick at Tuesday's for dinner.  It was Anjali's birthday, and somehow I decided that it would be a good idea to drive the hour down to Mohegan Sun to visit her and Kit.  Well, to my surprise, it WAS a good idea.  Ken came, and we had a great time.  I hadn't seen them in forever.  We wandered around, got some ice cream, looked at some shops, and Ken got all protective whenever guys were acting sketchy to us.  It was unbelievably cute.  Then on Friday I went home, got my hair cut, and saw Sam and Kit this time...we went to dinner and got some Starbucks, and somehow decided that we're going on a trip to DC in May with all of the girls.  What fun.

I had to get back Friday night so I could pick up Heidi for our meeting on Saturday morning with our new landlord.  (Yay!  We have a house now!  I get to live with my HK again!  And with Alex!  WOOHOO!  I'm not gonna live on the street!)  Also, so that we could go out to birthday dinner at the Mews with Troy, Alex, Sara, and Ken, since it was Heidi's birthday.  Although we waited an hour, the food was good, and it was nice to be able to hang out with everybody.  Once we got back, we all dressed up in crazy creepy black clothes for the Heaven and Hell party...which me and Ken only went for a few hours of, cause he had work the next morning, but HK and Sara didn't get back till 4 AM.  Tisk tisk.  ;-)

And now i get to go to lunch with the regular lunch crew... (last wednesday we sat at the dining hall for 2 straight hours...)  It's nice to see friends.  As much as I love Ken, it's really important that I get to see them too, or else I begin to get depressed and sad.  Also, now that the weather is getting nicer, my spirits are picking up.  Nothing is better than some sunshine.  :-)

I guess they had auditions for roles, and they couldn't find a male good enough to play his part, so they told me that I was going to be it.  The female version of him, I suppose, or something.  Which is weird, but oddly cool.  He has some awesome songs.

I had to go back to school today?  I just went to Invertebrate Zoology and learned about Crustaceans (which is exciting for me!...but not for the rest of you.)

Ummmm....I hung out with Nick, Ken and Heidi over the weekend.  We went to the Guitar Center and played around on instruments, went to dinner and Ken had some undercooked steak, and then we went to Amazing because it seemed like a good idea at the time...

"event","So lately, fishbowls and aquariums and aquatic things have been floating around in my dreams.  In particular, this certain aquarium that has appeared in my dreams twice now.  It's a dark aquarium that completely surrounds you...the ceiling and everything are part of the aquarium.   And the aquarium is completely filled with HUGE, enormous creatures.  It's all super-large animals.  Giant squid, giant jellies, giant octopus, giant fish, giant sharks...even a giant frog.  They are awe-inspiring, yet scary at the same time, because a giant jelly fish is obviously quite frightening.

In the first dream, me and Ken are walking around the aquarium, and I'm so impressed, and he's not.  Then some lady with a gun walks in and goes crazy, and the security guards try to get her out, but in the struggle, she shoots the aquarium wall twice.  Water starts flooding in and everyone is running and screaming, not only because they don't wnat to drown, but becuase they don't want to get squashed by a giant squid.

In the second dream, I'm showing Heidi the aquarium.  I'm alone in the aqurium at first, completely in awe by all of the creatures.  I run out to get Heidi, because I want to show her all of these magnificent, over-sized animals.  So I bring her in, yet all of the giant animals are hiding somehow, and she's not very impressed.

Wonder what it all means, and why I have a obsession with giant squid, and other large, frightening, aquatic animals?"

Today, me and Sara made pasta, and IIIIII helped!  Actually, Sara made the pasta.  But I made the brownies, almost all by myself!  That made Sara proud of me. :-)  She's slowly but surely domesticating me.

Today, my Biology internship TA Mike remarked that our DNA purification had the highest concentration of DNA that he's ever had before, thus meaning that me and Greg (the other intern) are awesome.  Which provoked this conversation:

Veronica: That's because me and Greg are special.
Greg: Yeahhhh, I've been practicing.
Mike: Wait...what?  Who else's lab have you been working in??

Gotta love Bio-type drama.

For the first time ever, classes really hate me a whole lot.  Astronomy is stupid and I'm probably going to drop it (actually, I haven't been to class the last two weeks or so, so I probably should drop that now...), Invertebrate Zoology is ridiculously hard, somehow I managed to forget about an Animal Behavior assignment, and Organic Chemistry is just satanic.  Ugh...if I get through all of it, I'll be happy.

On a good note though, I'm slowly starting to get to know more of the Bio people at URI.  I would like to get to know them better...I mean, it is my department and everything.  Plus I could always use friends.  Because...I have none. :-(

I miss having friends, and hanging out with people.

I miss living on campus, and having everybody right there.  But what can you do?

I guess it just is the sad truth of growing up, working, having your own place, etc etc etc...

Anyways, gotta go to Ken's show and such. :-)"

Your birth on the 2nd day of the month adds a degree of emotion, sensitivity, and intuition to your life. 

The 2 is a very social number allowing you to make friends easily and quickly. 

Yet you are apt to have a rather nervous air in the company of a large group. 



You have a warmhearted nature and emotional understanding that constantly seeks affection. 

You are more prone than most to become depressed and moody, as emotions can turn inward and cause anxiety and mental turmoil. 

It can be hard for you to bounce back to reality when depression sets in.</td>

"event","In movie tradition, these are my top 10 movies of 2004.

<U> The Top 10 Films of 2004! </U>

10) SPIDERMAN 2: A very good action movie, perhaps best than the first.  Because it is focused around Peter's internal struggle, it's the superhero movies for people who don't like superhero movies.
9) INCREDIBLES: Pixar does it again; it is both funny and profound.  It deals with a lot of adult issues as well, so anybody can enjoy it.  Plus, I like movies with powers.  It's fun.
8) KILL BILL 2:  For those of you who enjoy gratuitous violence and loved Kill Bill 1, you may have found this movie dissapointing.  It was drastically less violent but was vastly superior in plot and story line.  Not to mention Bill and her Sensei are awesome!
7) PHANTOM OF THE OPERA: Absolutly beautiful.  An accurate and well-told movie version of the play; the singing is superior, and the Phantom makes you love and hate him at the same time.  Direction and visuals were astounding.  Those who loved the play will be pleased.
6) RAY: Don't get me wrong, I really loved this movie.  The acting on Jamie Foxx's part was certainly award-winning, and the directing was very good.  For a 3 hour long movie, it only got tedious in the last half an hour.
5) GARDEN STATE: A very hip movie with an excellent soundtrack and a very simple but charming story.  Braff and Portman are at their best.
4) ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF A SPOTLESS MIND: This movie will make your head spin.  It's very intense and original, in the directors style, but is at the same time a charming and thought provoking love story.
3) HERO: The visuals and cinemetography in this movie are...breathtaking.  Jet Li actually does a decent acting job although he is second to the other three samurai in this film.  A complicated and involved story, but very interesting.
2) FINDING NEVERLAND: I really loved this story.  It's so simple, totally innocent, full of imagination and magic.  Johnny Depp's acting is subtle but touching.
1) AVIATOR: A three hour long movie where I wasn't bored for a single instant.  I was literally on the edge of my seat at certain points, and was totally involved in this story of Howard Hughes.  Scorcese and Dicaprio deserve Oscars.  Wonderful.

<U> Honorable Mentions: </U> Napoleon and Sideways.  NAPOLEON DYNAMITE was excellent as an independent, little known film but it gained a lot of random popularity and now it's a ""in"" thing and that makes it not so fun.  And SIDEWAYS was really, really good and I definitly liked it but I didn't feel very much during the course of the movie except for hatred for one of the characters and pity for the others, so although I appreciated how this movie could be meaningful and great to some people, it's affect was minimal on me.  TERMINAL was also an excellent movie, both sweet and moving, but it was forgettable.

I DON'T want to go back to school!

I had such a GREAT vacation (save for some rough spots) and it's always so nice to see Z everyday and now it sucks that he has to go back to Boston, especially since I had to go and crash the Buick and now I'm carless.  My mom says I'll prolly get another one in a month, sometime in Feb, but it SUCKS cuz I miss him like crazy but I won't be able to see him as much except for when he comes home or if I decide to take the train/bus/commuter rail which I probably will end up doing for the weekend or something.

"event","I'm really lazy.  It's Wednesday morning and I'm lying in bed watching ""Lord of the Rings"" (Fellowship of the Ring) while ripping music to put on my Nomad and avoid getting out of bed.  This is the same thing I did ALL yesterday, because after work it started to snow, and I was horribly unable to see my favorite person in all the world, and had to sit at home ALL day watching Disney Channel, ""Pixel Perfect"", eating, playing video games and oh yes...being lazy.

My existence is sad sometimes.

School starts again in a couple days but I'm not looking forward to it.  RIght now I'm sans car...parents say that they will probably get me another car in a couple of weeks, but for the first few weeks at school I will be motor less, which of course sucks cause it will be harder to see Z.  He says though that he will be coming home more,w hich is good, and he MIGHT (fingers crossed) have a car.  That would be spledid.

Pfizer didn't work out...grrr.  Them and Brown University (who rejected me) will pay someday!

Luckily I've seen almost everyone this vacation (YAY!) and have also been working, which is good.  We've been opening and closing the store, which is quite the adventure, but has been overall fun (While Jean and Chuck are away at a buying show.)

Well I guess I will see you all soon (at school...grrr another semester.)  :-)  Hope you all had a good vacation!"

"event","Today, I was driving home about a half an hour after the snow began to fall, thinking it would be okay, and I had been on the highway no more than five minutes when the Buick lost traction.  I jerked my car steering wheel away from the other cars next to me and the Buick went into the guard rail, then ricocheted (don't know how to spell that word...umm...bounced) and spun 180 degrees and backed into the guard rail again.

So alas.  The Enemy Tank is dead.

I will miss it. :(

So for the current time - I am carless.  And I don't know how long this will last - if I will be getting another car soon, etc.  Hopefully soon.  And at least I am okay.  And I didn't crash into any other cars.

Wow.

AMAZING.

What an amazing play.  I havn't been to a play in forever and it was incredible!  The sets were incredible...the actors and actresses were awesome...the music was absolutly beautiful...the plot was so much fun.  How great!  I havn't seen such a great play in a long time...well, probably since ""Les Miserables"" or ""Phantom of the Opera""!  My mom bought me the soundtrack so now I can listen to the music forEVER!

The whole experience was pritty great.  We got on the bus at 8:30 and watched ""The Wizard of Oz"" to get ourselves reacquainted with the plot and characters.  I fell alseep for a while.  When we got to New York, Erin and I decided to try the lottery at the Gershwin theatre for front row tickets, but we didn't end up getting them. :-(  But it was still fun roaming off in New York by ourselves (now that I think on it, amazing that our parents were so cool about us roaming off in New York by ourselves!)  We met up with the rest of the group at this GREAT pizzeria that had three floors!  It was awesome.  I had ravioli and cheesecake and it was tons of fun.

Then we saw the play (YAY!) and went to ESPN Zone so the adults could have some beers.  Me and Erin wandered around NY trying to find a deli and ended up getting some really good European Sandwiches.  Overall, it was a great time.

Oh!  And LOTS AND LOTS OF CHEERS to the Red Sox for beating the Cardinals so far 0-2!  I'm so jealous of Tom being able to go to the games (although I had a chance to go with some random guys driving through Boston haha...).  But Tom promised me that if he saw Johnny Damon at an upcoming game he would say hello for me and let him know that he's my boy.

:-)

LYRICS OF THE DAY:
""And if you care to find me
Look to the western sky!
As someone told me lately
Everyone deserves a chance to fly!
And if I'm flying solo,
At least I'm flying free
To those who'd try to ground me
Bring a message back from me,
Tell them how I'm defying gravity
I'm flying high defying gravity
And no one's gonna bring me down...""
-Defying Gravity ""Wicked"""

"event","I have this really bad habit of agreeing to things months in advance and then, when the time comes, realizing that I don't really want to do it but I agreed to it in the first place because I figured, ""Hey, it's two months away!  It doesn't affect me now!""

This weekend I'm going to New York with the family to see ""Wicked""...which should be fun, it's supposed to be a good show, and we're going with a big group of people.  But it's kind of annoying thinking that I could be in Boston (which is my favorite city ever) to see Zack (who is my favorite person ever) but it's probably good that he will have time to see some of his friends and get work done while I go and have some quality mommy-and-daughter time.

My mommy loves me.  When the RED SOX! won the other night I called my mom at one o'clock in the morning...

Mom: (sounding drugged) ...Hello...?
Veronica: Mom!  It's me!
Mom: ...yeah?
Veronica: The Red Sox won against the Yankees!  They're going to the series!
Mom: ...that's GREAT hun...
Veronica: I wanted to share my excitement with you.
Mom: Well I'm glad you did...now go to bed...

:-D

Which brings me to the Sox!  That night was awesome!  One of the best nights ever...or at least of the year!  So incredible!  I've never been so into a sports team before and thanks to Zack and his family, I've come to love them even more because I saw so many of the post-season games that I was with them every step of the way! :-)  Annnnd Johnny Damon is my favorite player now, I love him.  He is now known to the group of friends as ""my boy"".  And everyone said he was sucking and he got two home runs!  Take that!

We all watched the game in the lounge of Aldrich on a big screen with a bunch of people and then after the game went out to the ""riots"" which were rather tame this year and followed a big group of cheering fans up to the quad.  Once we got there the activity kind of died but it was still fun none-the-less. 

I also went to a Death Cab for Cutie show...everyone said the suck live but they were really great!  They played a very long set (two hours or so) and did a great job.  Their opening band wasn't too good though.  Also the venue was nice but very squished and I molested a lot of people by accident.  It was great though because they gave us the baseball score as the night went on, so that made it even better!  Some girls behind me were like, ""Why do they have to bring baseball into this?"" and I wanted to kill them.

Stupid people.  We were right next to Fenway!  Of course we care!

Anyways...onto everyone's favorite segment...

QUOTES OF THE DAY!
Veronica: I'm putting an embargo on you speaking.

Adam: Go Marlins!  It's their year!
Veronica: They're not IN the series!
Adam: Oh they'll find a way...

Adam: The Marlins are going to FLY in from Florida on their magical boat Scooter...Scooter the Magical Marlins Boat!  And they will fly into Fenway and capture the Red Sox and kill the Cardinals and win the series again!

Tom: Your child would be Andrew W.K."

C'mon Red Sox!  We can still come back!  This is our last change... :-)

And I'd like to also comment on a thought I had the other day in Boston after I saw a ""Keep the Faith"" sign...

I don't really understand Red Sox fans who are atheist.  It seems to me like they are very similar.  Believing in God existing is kind of like believing in the Red Sox winning the series...you've never seen it, but you have a feeling its right around the corner, or at least possible..."

"event","I keep trying to write in my live journal, but it never seems to work, these days.  I've been under a lot of stress from a number a factors (having to do with school, finding a job, etc etc) and so it's been difficult for me to put a lot of my thoughts in words.  I had such an amazing fall weekend last weekend at home with Zack...we got pumpkins and had cider and went for walks in the woods.  It was so wonderful to enjoy fall in New England, in the suburbs. We went to Woodstock CT, a beautiful area, and visited a couple of holiday shops, and also stopped by a church fair.  Overall it was a great time...(even picking him, Adam and Mark up from the local bar and taking them home.) =D

Unfortunatly I don't get to see Zack for a little while...I had to leave early this weekend because some guy friends were coming up for a couple of days, and next weekend I'll be in NY with the family.  I'm going to miss him. :-( Over the last couple of days I've really realized how much Zack is my closest friend and how, no matter what, even if we were to not work out in the long run, I want to be friends forever.  Its wierd not to see him (like loosing a limb, right love?)

I don't know how I'm doing in any classes except Japanese (which is very good). I took a lot of tests and should be getting them back soon.  Fingers crossed!

Oh!  I havn't had THESE in a while!

QUOTES OF THE DAY:
Prof. Kim: Kill the bee!  Kill the bee!
Student: We don't have any WEAPONS to kill the bee.
Prof. Kim: You have weapons to bomb Iraq, you don't have weapons to kill the bee!?

Adam: Do eskimos pay rent on igloos?"

"event","I kind of miss the old Livejournal frenzy.  Because I was just looking back on old entries, and it made me smile, because it reminded me of all these great and fun things that happened last year that I had totally forgotten about, including a plethora of inside jokes and comments.

So.  I don't know.  I sort of feel like I'd like to keep writing in this Livejournal thing, not so that anyone else but me can read them, but so that next year I can look back on all the things I've said this year, and smile.  Especially at my favorite section, Quotes of the Day. =)

On Tuesday I went to Intervarsity for the first time in a LONG time!  Boy I've missed that place.  It was so great to see everyone again and feel part of my religion.  Not that my faith in God was any less, but worship is always such a wonderful part of my week.  I'd forgotten how much I love being able to sing and praise.  Today I also went to AWE, the first one of the year.  It was at RIC (which I think was where the last one was), and it was as good as always.  There wasn't a sermon this time, but only singing and some prayer.  I encourage ANYONE to go! 

Espeically Adam.  I'd like to see him running around Intervarsity in a Jesus constume.  I wonder how well that would go over... =)

On Wednesday I got to see Zack, once again. :-) I think he hates me right now...he went to Keenans house rather than talk to me, evil boy! =)))...but it was fun, we walked all around South End and I lead us in one giant circle!  And we spent a good hour trying to locate a bathroom, but all in all it was a good time.  ALSO!  We watched the Red Sox game!  Yay!  We won, again!  8-3, take that Angels! (And Adam, who is rooting for the Angels, crazy New Yorker).  Lets all keep our fingers crossed that we make it into the series...

If the Red Sox won the series...and Kerry won the election...it would be the best year ever.  :)

Thats all for now...bye bye!"

I guess I doomed him to death anyways.

We think he starved to death because Sara's goldfishie eats all the food. Pooooor Fourteen Days.  I knew thee well.  Sara's going to go pick me up another goldfishie when she goes home this weekend.  I hope this one lives.

But everything I touch seems to die.

Like plants.

And fish.

Occasionally people. ::Sigh::

Anyways, I have class tommorow and that's no fun. =( But I get to see Z tommorrow and that IS fun.  Except he's being evil right now and not calling me even though it's almost 12:30 and I have to go to bed grrrrr but I can't go to sleep before talking to him cuz otherwise I'm WIIIIIDDEE awake.

Evil boy.

Anyways. That's all I had to say.  We had a funeral for the goldfishie.  I sung it a song.  We flushed it down the toilet.  Everyone say a prayer for my goldfish, and that the next one doesn't die. =(

"event","It's back to school for me!  Yep, I'm here, back at URI.  I moved in a couple of days ago...on Monday...and today was my FIRST DAY OF CLASSES.  Already I can tell that I'm going to have a LOT more homework than I had last year.  But...we'll get to all that later.  First, lets discuss moving in.

We were here at 9:00 in the morning.  It took us quite a while to get everything set up but now it's looking quite beautiful.  I actually really like our room set up this year.  I think Aldrich will be great, and I'm also psyched about having Sar and Ash living right next door!  The first day that I was here, we went to Wallmart to buy some duckie items to decorate our bathroom with, and we went to lunch and dinner at Butterfield to reminsce, and visited everybody and saw all of their rooms.  It was nice to see Sar, Ash, Tom, Phil, Adam, Meg, George, Chris, and of course the boys from home again.

It's going to be SO awesome having Alex on campus!

Anyways.  So it's nice to be back.  I miss Z like crazy though and I can't wait to see him.  I wish he had a car so on the days that I can't go there he can come here.  But oh well.  I'm sure he's having a blast in Boston.

Summer '04 Zack - a great time.

Lets see.  As for classes?  I just got back from Bio (my teacher seems REALLY sweet!) Chem (my teacher is really short and has a big beard and bushy eyebrows and seems nice enough) and East Asian Culture and History.  I heart my professor.  He has very slow and broken english, and he is an elderly gentlemen, and he's a bit confusing, but he seems REALLY nice!  Also he says that he beleives that there are ""no correct answers"" and that ""through diversity the truth will emerge"".  He is very Zen, and I like that.

Still got Calc, Japanese, and Oriental Religions and Philosophy to go!  It'll be a lot of work, but a lot of fun.

=) OHHHHH!!!!  And Sara and Ashers and Mel and I got FISH!  Four goldfish!  12 cent goldfish!  And a pritty tank!  With rocks!  And fake plants!  It is so pritty!  They live in our bathroom.  Names are as follows:

Ashers: Pussy (oh god don't ask)
Mel: Popcorn
Sara: Sparky
Me: Fourteen Days

Why fourteen days?  Cuz if it dies within fourteen days I get a new one!  And I'm kind of convinced it'll croak.  ::Sigh::

QUOTES OF THE DAY:
Alex: Okay...after extreme genetic alterations...I have created a half-fish, half-puppy...
Sara: With two butts?
Alex: ...named Finding Scruffy.

Sara: I should name my goldfish Archie!
Veronica: Right...because Archie...kind of sounds like ORANGE...if you use your imagination...
Sara: Archie had red hair.
Veronica: ...ooooohhhhhh.

Mel: I was going to name it kettle corn but then I thought it would be mean cuz people would think of putting it on a kettle.  So I'm going to stick with popcorn.
Ve: Now I'm thinking of POPPING it."

When is everyone planning on moving in?  I guess Sar, Mel and I are going to be there around 9 o'clock...nice and early! =)  I'm looking forward to organizing our new room and having four of my close friends in the same building as me and having all the rest of them really close by.  I also did some research on ratemyprofessors.com and it seems that all my teachers are really good (with the exception of my Organic Chem teacher...yay for me) so that makes me feel a lot better!

I'm going to miss Zack half to death though (even your bad moods, love ;)).  I'm only going to be able to see him during the weekends, and considering that I'm used to seeing him every day, it's going to be really wierd at first not having him be there.  We've had some really fun times this summer.  Last night we played Mini-golf with his parents which was a lot of fun. =)  We were playing teams (me and Z against his parents) and whoever lost had to clean his bathroom on Monday.  Thank goodness that we won! (Otherwise I think Z would have disowned me).  I even got a hole in one (on the SAME hole I got a hole in one on last time!)  It was the happiest thing ever.

So anyways.  You always say that I never right stuff about you in my live journal.  But HAH!  I am now!  I'm going to miss you =)

I wonder how all my upcoming-URI-freshman friends are doing on their first day there? =)  Be optomistic Bryce!

::Sighs:: I'm such a mix of extreme excitement and extreme sadness. =) It'll be a crazy year!

Now for some quotes of the day!

QUOTES OF THE DAY:
Veronica: (going on and on about a movie for about ten minutes) ...and it uses such EXTREME colors to symbolize the different emotions of the characters at different points in the story...
Allen: I talk HALF that much in a year.

Alex: (singing a made-up song) And then I took a carrot and I stuck it in my ear...
Veronica: ...that could have ended much worse.

(After buying a paper shoe for a dollar at Stop and Shop to help kids with Diabetes)
Veronica: Well guys...we did a very good thing today...we helped out all the kids who have no shoes.
Alex: (cracking up) Yes we're helping kids with Diabetes by giving them shoes!

Alex: I have a question.  If people who's ancestors came from Africa and live in America are African-Americans....does that mean that people who's ancestors come from America and live in Africa are American-Africans?

Zack: Okay Veronica, what's below Connecticut?
Veronica: ...Georgia?

Mrs. Lamothe: Today in class one of my classmates told me that he touched a squirrel.  Apparently he saw a squirrel very close to him and thought, ""When will I ever have an opportunity to touch a squirrel again?"""

"event","One week left of working!!  Well, full time.  I'm going to be putting in a few weekends, just to help out, but basically I'll be DONE!  Hurrah!

Not to say there arn't things about work that I will miss.  Mostly the people and getting free food and discounts on stuff.  But hey.  I might be back next year, if the big ""I"" word doesn't work out.

Note to others: ""I"" word is my mom's code for ""Internship""

So anyways.  A couple of days ago I had an awesome time with my buddy Alexander, who unfortunatly I havn't gotten to see as often as I would have liked to recently.  We watched some of his most recent films and went to this cute Mexican resteraunt in Old Lyme called ""The Whole Enchilada"" where I got a great burrito.  Then me, him and Allen got ice cream at this ice cream shop that scarred me for life when I was a young child (I got attacked there my massive amounts of Japanese beetles) and we walked down to the beach and just kind of wandered.  My mom and grandma tried to convince me to go on the merry-go-round, but Allen and Alex wouldn't go with me. =(

Then me and Alex spent an hour in Video World and ended up getting a couple of movies, including DIGIMON!!!  The first three episodes of Digimon!!  It's soooooo awesome!!  I want to find the first season on DVD very badly!  I love that show so very much.

Otherwise?

Of course I have seen Zack as always, although we havn't really done a ton, we havn't even really seen his friends which is kind of random.  I'm sort of used to them being around, but they've all been busy or what not.  With any luck, we'll find something exciting to do soon! =) I'm thinking maybe Newport or Waterfire?  Who knows?

Anyways.  That's all I have to say for now.  Adieu."

"event","Hello all,

I needed to write for the first time in a while.  I've been very enthralled by the rat race as per usual. not taking the time for Bill that is really needed.  So I will take the 5 minutes I need to get things out of me, and what better place than to put them on the blog. So I think the thing that cause me most consternation right now is my professional career.  I've been doing the same thing for over a decade now and I think I'm burned out.  The challenge isn't there anymore.  I can walk into work everyday and do my job and go home and nothing new has happened.  Every once and a long while a challenge comes along that perks me up and makes me stretch by right now, the challenge is not letting my performance in my job fall off.

I'm relied on by many companies and individuals to keep the tools they use to make a living.  While this is very gratifying and can be very rewarding in a personal way, I find that right now it isn't enough.  I've written on this blog before about taking personal responsibility for your decisions and actions.  I fully admit to the fact that my current environment and situation is a result of decisions that I have made, and that is OK.  I will make the best of this situation as I always try to do, but the pick problem is I'm confused inside me as to what are the things I need to do in my professional life to make the situation better.

I've always had an ability to put something away in my brain and work on it when I can and need to.  This has been one of those questions that I never dealt with, ""where do you see yourself in 5 years.""  I always thought this was a bullshit question, but I think I'm starting to realize that this is a very important and relevant question that I need to work on.  I will just have to show patience and find a way to make time to think this out. 

If you read this and it makes any sense please comment, it is always helpful to have an outside opinion, even if it is a ""man up stupid, life's hard"" I think I might just need that kick in the ass."

""Everyone is a prisoner of his own experiences. No one can eliminate prejudices - just recognize them.""
This quote is something that I think after my trip to the US seems more important than ever.  In a city like San Francisco where it seems there is so little prejudice I think it's important to recognize a city that sees what is truly important and that is helping people.

While on my trip there and took a trip to Haight street which can be said is the Hippie district.  I saw so many people there helping and caring for people on the street and each other that I think we should learn from the example.  It was truly inspiring, Thanks San Francisco"

"event","Hey everyone,

This is the day a year ago that my father passed away.  I haven't been sad about it all day until just a few minutes ago.  In my job I like to help people.  I like to go that extra mile and try to make a person happy.  But on a day like today I just can't understand how some people don't understand how good they have it.

People complain that their computer is taking to long or that they have been wronged by this company or that.  I understand that that happens but guess what,  That's the way it goes some times.  You don't see me calling up GM when my wheel bearing goes and saying you have a defective product.  Fix it for free.  I am really approaching my saturation point in this seemingly self centered society.

I would love to know how to fix it.  I think the world would be a better place if people were more accepting of there situations and took personal responsibility for it.  On this day of the Anniversary of my Father's death from skin cancer, I remember what my father said to me during his illness.  He could have gotten angry about it,  He could have blamed society, but he looked on it as another challenge and moved forward and fought hard.  He beat the odds,  He lived much longer than any doctor ever said he would.

So if this anniversary can mean anything I hope it can show that taking responsibility for your decision is as important as living with that decision."

"event","Today is truly a sad day for the world.  My good Friend John Scratch lost his Father last night unexpectedly in his  sleep.  This beautiful man that many knew as ""Poppa Scratch"" has been a constant force for good in his community and a source of strength for many.

In his honor I would like to tell a small story that I remember with Poppa.  On the day of my wedding Poppa came to our wedding in full garb.  I had many people ask who was the guy in the Robes.  A little later on that day at the reception, he spoke very kindly of Anika and myself and brought a tear to everyone assembled.

As he was about to leave he came to me and asked where my father was.  You see, at the time my father had been battling cancer for many years and the Scratch's having learned from the experience with the matriarch of there family, who also passed away from cancer were helping me deal with my father's illness.  So we searched the hotel high and low, trying to find my father.  When we found him, it was a most interesting meeting.

My father who is not a religious man, meeting with Father Scratch.  But it was amazing my father and Poppa spoke for about 10 minutes alone while I watched, they laughed and smiled and at the end of it all.  They hugged.   This is very out of character for my father.  But it was amazing to see the power this man had to bring happiness and love into the world. 

Poppa Scratch was an inspiration to me and many more.  I know he is somewhere now with his lovely wife seeing the amazing children they have go forth and do good things in this world.  In remembrance of him, I Post this picture;

A Great Memory of 2 great Men.

"event","I have 2 other blogs that I maintain, but those are professional blogs.  Talking about technology and other things that have to do with my job.  This blog will deal more with the personal things I want to talk about.  No technorati tags or trackbacks here. This is just going to be a place for me to write what I'm feeling about anything.  I use to do this regularly on my computer, till I lost the file 7 years ago in a hard drive crash.  So i figured, why not put it online. 

I don't understand the full dynamic of livejournal yet but I hope to.  Hey Davenpo - if you are reading this and I hope you are.  Glad to hear you made it.  Don't be a stranger man send me an email.  Miss you already brother.

Talk at you guys later."

"event","Well, Brockville has come and gone.  Man do I hurt!  Rather unfortunately, we did not play the Cameron Highlanders this year, nor did our #1 Team.  S'okay, tho.  Seems the refs, however, do not like our teams all that much.  Gee, I guess they do not like the fact that we play old fashioned hockey; hard and fast.  I personally took 2 high-sticks in the face and there was no call.  This was done by the same individual during the course of the game!  

     Today, desptie my broken and bruised appearance is my physical for OPG.  Gotta make sure I am nice and healthy so they can make me glow in the dark...LOL.  The physical is not unlike any I have taken, has a lot more informarion to it as far as skin tone and what-not.  As I have understood, if you get too much radiation, as in a potentially leathal dose, the radiation posioning will turn skin grey with ulcer-like sores on it....hope no one is eating a meal when they read this!"

"event","Our yearly ritual is now here for all us wanna-be NHLers within the Reserve Force from Oshawa and east to the Quebec border.  Hockey Night In Brockville.  An entire weekend spent playing hockey and enjoying copious quantities of brown pop until we fall down.  Not that I would endorse such an activity, where we would fall down.....lol

     Also, it allows us to re-kindle the other 'Battle of Ontario' that the media likes to pump up when the Leafs beat, er play, the Senators in the post-season.  Another Regiment, ironically located in Ottawa, known as the Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa and my Regiment, have a rather passionate dislike for each other.  Not exactly related to the fact the Senators choke against Toronto every time they play each other in the post-season; but when we played spoiler to prevent their team from getting into the playoff round in the tournament 5 years ago.  My, my, my, talk about sore winners.

     How it happened was simply like this.  Our #2 Team is not very good.  We enjoy a good, hard skate and have fun when we play.  Sure we used to get blown out of the water, but we have fun.  Bottom line.  We were beat 11-0 and 9-1 in our first two games.  We knew the Camerons were a good team, they needed 11 goals to get into the playoffs.  Well, we held them to a 10-0 win, and using legal tactics in hockey; that is icing the puck and what-not.  With a run-time game, is makes for an interesting stress level to say the least.  Well, they did not get into the playoffs and well, the didn't even bother coming out to the BBQ/party at the Brockville Armoury that night.  They packed up their things and left for Ottawa.  Like I said, sore winners."

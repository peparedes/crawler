"event","so when did i last update?  i don't even know.  all i know is that God has blessed me beyond anything i could have ever dreamed!  this past weekend i went on a CCF retreat and it was a really great experience.  There were a lot of difficult times while we were on the retreat, but i have learned so much and have been able to get closer with so many people.  Saturday night was especially hard when we had a campfire late at night...it was almost like deja vu as i stood there watching everyone stand around the fire laughing, singing songs, and toasting marshmellows...it was like the retreats we used to go on in high school and all of us would be swinging on the rope swing, doing skits, making s'mores... and as i was looking at saturday's campfire, i knew that the picture that was in my head would be added to the fond memories of retreats with jacob, nelly, ray, wayne, wendi, ted, grace, edwin, mo....to name a few.  jake--i miss you so much. happy birthday.  =) i'm always praying for your family....

this weekend i learned just how far my faith has to go.  my faith is so weak and so little, even though God has NEVER given me a reason to doubt Him.  and i mean that in all the circumstances that have happened in my life, even though i may still struggle sometimes with things of the past.  God, you love me even more than i love myself, you have made us all divine creations and just the way you wanted us to be.  i should never be ungrateful for that.  i want to be able to have an expectant faith, to pray for rain tomorrow and be able to go outside with my galoshes, raincoat, and umbrella the next day even if it's sunny.

i have the most incredible boyfriend in the world and i know that he is the ONLY one for me! =)  I can hardly describe the feelings that i have just thinking about him!  we have such a long way to go and so much work needs to be done on both of us--but i know that God is in control and that He brought us together for a reason.  i can never get enough of spending time with Al =) ok well...i guess this update will have to do for now...time to study for my test tomorrow!"

"event","dude how long has it been since i've updated?  i don't even know.  well things are just going that great that's why!!! :) ummm let's see, so back at school...the rest of break was fun...(just worked) i should be starting work again soon but there's just been a ton of stuff to do for Blue Notes right now. yay singing!!!

so i am sooo giddy right now because i am one of the happiest girls in the world =)  i had the absolute BEST birthday every last week!  =)  (especially for having a long day of classes) ok, soooo i woke up in the morning to a surprise scavenger hunt around my apartment from Al which they set up after i went to bed REALLY late the night before (sorry guys!) and wound up with a gorgeous boquet of lilies and snap dragons and roses... and a framed picture of us with a frame that was ""so cute its painful =)""  then i had class all day....had an awesome birthday lunch with Laura and Al, and Laura sang me the cutest birthday song ever =)  Then i had class til 7...and afterwards Al took me out to dinner at Aberdeen Barn and it was SOO good.  i couldn't have asked for a more perfect setting--some guy playing piano in the background, a curved booth so we could sit close, great food, and the sweetest date =)  then we went over to Mo's apartment where she and her apartmentmates surprised me with a cake and balloons and stuff.  I have the best sister in the world!!!! =)  God has truly truly blessed me, and i hope that i can do as much for my friends as they have done for me =)

on that note--I'm 21!!!! ahhh!!!!  hehe, actually...it doesn't really make a difference since i haven't used it yet and don't really plan to.... =)

ok, i still have homework to do!!! ahhh!!!!

"event","WOW sorry it's been so long to update!  well...i'm not sick anymore... =P.  sorry i didn't realize it's been this long!  well, i had a GREAT thanksgiving and christmas and new year's eve =).  the end of the semester was REALLY busy...I almost failed my classes and I had to do a whole semester's worth of work for each class so I was always at the library and studying and not getting sleep.  But that's over now!!

So now I am home for winter break.  The weather these past few days has been gorgeous!  I've gone running a total of three times this week with Maureen and today I even tried sprinting a little.  My knee still hurts all the time but that's OK as long as I can snowboard.  I am SOO excited for when I can finally go snowboarding--I know it's going to stink like crazy and I'm not going to be any good...but I am preparing myself for the worst so it should be ok =)

i've been working like crazy at the Ruby Tuesday's up here.  They are SO short staffed and they immediately scheduled me for a ton of hours.  so i haven't really gotten to hang out with anyone =(  yesterday I worked a double which wasn't too bad.  afterwards I went over to Kim's where maureen and lisa and kim were baking really really good brownies and blondies =)  and Danielle came who I haven't seen since we visited South Carolina and we all had a really good time just chillin' and watching SNL's best of Chris Farley.  so funny i laughed a lot =)

anyways...I guess that's kind of the update for now!  sorry it's been so long (for all you dedicated readers....right...=)  i hope to keep it up better <--there's one New Year's resolution!"

"event","oh wow i've been having too much fun =) yesterday was great....blue notes rehearsal, ccf, and semi-formal--that was really fun =)  i will get pictures up at some point =)  but today, oh man, today--today was GORGEOUS.  it was so sunny....the air was crisp...and the skies were clear...

after work at 2 i decided to be adventurous and drive down barracks road to eat my lunch and to see what was down there. (there was a ton of traffic on emmet because of the game so i didn't feel like going home just yet).  i ended up driving almost half an hour down that road past rolling hills and farms...it was so so gorgeous.... and i found a church on the side of the road with a cemetary (mt. moriah...or something like that???) so i parked there and ate my lunch and then took a little walk.  the church and cemetary are sort of on the top of a little hill...and you could hear cows mooing and see the mountain range right in front of you.  and the sun was just shining so brightly....and it was so peaceful...and i just wanted to sing and dance because of the BEAUTY of God's creation...and it was just so wonderful to just spend time with Him. =)

anyways... later Al came by and we hung out and at night we drove down 64 to some scenic overlooks to see the stars.  OH MAN.  i've wanted to do this for SO long...I am still in a giddy state of excitement.  There were just so many stars!  and it was SOOO beautiful...i just wanted to soak it in.  God, you are SO good to us all, and everything you've created is just so wonderful--thank you that i can take the time to enjoy it!  it's so humbling to look out at the speckled dome above and realize that it doesn't even end there...that what we see isn't even the TIP of the iceberg.  wow.  my heart is just BURSTING with so much joy.  God, i love you so much =)...i could go on for ages =)"

this past weekend was....well, expensive is the first word that comes to mind!  i went to rochester for the weekend to see some of my friends from freshman year.  i didn't really get to see/hand out with that many people but that was mostly my fault because i didn't really give much warning that i was coming.  thanks march for everything.  it was a nice chill weekend, but i am glad to be back home in Charlottesville even though i tend not to admit it when i am here.... i think this weekend helped me to see that i am in a good place, and this is where God wants me.

anyways, i should be sleeping this cold away so i will leave now with this song because i was singing it in the shower at the top of my lungs....alas, to no one in particular =)

but now it's so much more

haha last night was really fun.  i ended up going to CCF with Al last night and went with a bunch of them to Peking Chinese Restaurant downtown.  oh man, they had karaoke there....it was fantastic.  i was really just there for the food, but it was also great to be serenaded by awesome people singing along with awesome accompianment tracks (cheesy, but awesome =)  speaking of good chinese food the dumpling place at the mall is REALLY good :) so yay good weekend!!! yay extra hour of sleep!!!! =)"

yesterday was really cool, my brother and sister came down to visit (in fact, they just left) and it was really fun to see them.  they helped me move into my new place too.  so far...i still haven't seen any of my roommates so i still don't really know where to put stuff...but hopefully that will change soon.

Greg and I saw Shrek 2 friday night--it ROCKS! =) =)

ok time to unpack some more i guess...!"

DUDE, i didn't even really do anything and i was exhausted.  it might have been because of the lack of sleep last night (couldn't sleep...) but still...DANIELLE I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU HANDLE ALL YOUR JOBS BUT YOU ARE MY HERO!!!  you are SUPERWOMAN.  =)  i'm really excited--i should be done training within a week and i think this job will be quite fun.  maybe eventually i can find a cooler place to work...like one with better music, or preferably, live music. (come on, guys, twangy country ALL morning??!?!?!?!) man, i really have a lot of work to do now because my final project is due by thursday and i'm working every day til then.  gotta focus!  i'm probably making the project more complicated than it has to be...but oh well, i think it'll be fun =)  i'm making a video collage =)  ok.  that's enough rambling for today.

"event","what a great night =) i went to the downtown mall and had a great time with myself.  (i'm being serious)  I just LOVED the atmosphere of the mall, with all the restaurants outdoors, random musicians playing outside of stores.  I got some Chinese food and then settled in the amphitheatre where the Boonsie Daniels Band played tonight--part of the weekly Fridays After 5 concert series in Charlottesville.  It was great.  I loved it.  And even though I didn't have anyone to dance with, I still felt just as good watching all the cute little kids dancing with their parents in the front to some good old soul music.  I couldn't stop laughing or dancing in my seat.  It's days like today that make things worthwhile. =)  Of course, I would have loved to have been in Nova though to see Politicks play, but this was a good runner-up =)  Erg... tomorrow i start work at 9 in the morning.  yay for money!!!"

KIDS HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY!! but it was a lot of fun :) running around... playing....running around some more...playing some more haha.  i haven't seen a lot of these kids in like two years, and they're all growing up so fast!!  it's funny when they ask me how old i am, and they don't believe me or they ask if i'm married and have my own car, etc.  i got to lead the songs...ahh the closest i'll ever get to being a rock star.  there's just that feeling of... i dunno i can't describe it, but i love it.  maybe it's just the power of sharing music to share feelings.  we all had a good time but i am exhausted.  mmmm i think i'll take a nap now =)"

"event","i'm feeling a lot better now--thank you guys for the virtual hugs =)  i think i wasn't used to being alone for most of the day yet so i was getting very emotional over some things.  i mean, it's still serious stuff, but i really just needed to calm down and take a step back and look at what i was doing, which i just did a few hours ago.  i can't say that i came to any conclusions....but i feel a ton better.  =)

class has been really great--the four hours fly by so quickly and then I still have the rest of the day to do whatever I want.  That includes going to the gym...most of the time...=)  I just finished this 5-8 paper we had to write about our educational autobiography.  man, i totally BSed the whole thing...but there really isn't much you could do with that kind of paper anyways.  i really feel good about this decision to go into teaching.  these past few days alone have just opened my eyes to how complex this profession is--despite the negative view most of America has about teachers and their intellect.

ok well i'll probably update again later.  a guitar is crying out to be made love to... duty calls ;)"

DUDE, the elevator to the dorm that I'm staying in wasn't working so I had to unpack all my stuff by myself and carry them up to the third floor.  It took me an hour and a half of going up and down--this definitely takes care of going to the gym for me today!!  i would've flopped right down and slept on my bed after i finished if it wasn't for all my junk that was covering it.  finally finished unpacking (well..mostly...at least i can sleep now! =)  Gotta get up early tomorrow so i'm off to bed!  yay for not having to live at home!!

(hehe although it will be interesting to see just how many meals i can make with only a microwave and no refridgerator and very little money for the next three weeks, i would've bought the whole chef boyardee section at Harris Teeter if they didn't cost more than a dollar! (1.69!!!!!)  so i got this sketchy looking ""asian teriyaki noodles"" that are microwavable with water and were only 79 cents.  we'll see how that goes :) ok peace i'm out

mental note to self--i still have no excuse for not going to the gym tomorrow!

Yay!! i hadn't seen those dudes in a year!!!  so that was a lot of fun :) :) REALLY REALLY HOT.  but it was all good :)  i still need to take advantage of living so close to DC and exploring even more all the cool places there are.  we ate at the Hotel Washington for dinner (up on the rooftop thingy so you can overlook the area, and see the roof of the White House with all the cool men in black :) :) and it's not like the food was that great or anything but that's gotta be one of my favorite types of restaurant/places to go--meaning like a place that's high up and open/lots of windows and you can just overlook everything.  makes me appreciate things and feel really good.  i hope everyone had a good time, i couldn't really tell for some.

"event","dammmm i am too emotional and sensitive for my own good.  i've been cleaning out my room (at home) and finally throwing away junk that i should've gotten rid of like...10 years ago.  literally.  (seriously, what was i gonna do with 10 year old diamaras of the babysitter's club???? =P)  i stumbled upon old pictures from like 6th grade..and then pictures from elementary school that my sibs and i used to take with these brightly colored cameras that looked like toys but actually took pictures.  i think i'm gonna freakin' cry right now...heh my bro was soo cute.  i guess i complained too much about how i didn't really have a childhood, and how strict my parents were... but i was just blocking out all the good times.  cuz there were a ton.  and i totally forgot about them!  dammit i really am crying now.  sorry...  the random sappy music playing from my comp isn't really helping either.  but i had it good, and it was so selfish of me to think otherwise.  i mean, every family has its own hardships to go through...

things change and move forward soo fast.  i don't know what my problem was...trying to make it go faster than it already was...why was i rushing forward?? no one knows what tomorrow holds...how long they have guaranteed to live... and i'm not saying this in a depressing way at all.  but i read back on all my old stuff (man, i was such a NERD hehe)...look back at my old pictures, notes, ""stories"", etc....and i don't know if I can say that where I am now is what I always dreamed.  so this is what i've rushed to?  i love college, i love everything that i have going on.  but if i knew this is where i would've ended up.... what am i saying, there's still sooo much more that's going to happen, that's going to change.  i just...i'm just not doing anything that my history could've suggested, things that i really wanted to do but was too afraid to admit and always letting others bring me down.  i can't really say specifically what i mean... i dunno i'm just babbling on until these stupid tears dry up.  hahaha don't worry i'm still in a good mood i really am.

i was cleaning out one of my old backpacks and i found jacob's nametag from the World Changer's mission trip.  dude, i didn't even know that i had it.  for some reason there's a popsicle stick inside it too...heh.  The top of the nametag has the theme of world changers that year--""live the call.""  Live the Call.  Are you living it?  Jake lived it.  I miss you man, I think about you everyday, and I can't wait until we all get to see you again.  No regrets--

My sister and brother and I overslept church today...oops!  I still need to catch up on all the sleep I lost because of finals week.  So yeah...we woke up to my dad's phone call and just met my parents and some of their friends at a Chinese restaurant to have a Mother's Day lunch.  That was really good.  makes up for the endless packs of ramen that I ate all last week because i didn't want to go buy groceries.  Hehe, when we got back home my mom and sister and I started trying on old chinese dresses that i randomly saw sticking out of the closet.  so we took some pictures for kicks--see them <A HREF=""http://community.webshots.com/user/rockstar_e25"">here</A> hehe.  anyways...probably gonna go play tennis with the sibs tonight and maybe watch the matrix revolutions (still haven't seen it yet!!)

Last year was absolutely crazy at work. Finally, if I got some free moment, I found it hard to come up with anything to do... Before that, I would simply have gone and checked the latest lolcats, or hung around on some message boards.

A nicer thing that kept me busy were Bollywood dance classes, and rehearsing a number for a couple of school shows. I managed, and had a really great time. Experiencing the backstage chaos is just priceless!

I'll have to try and check this site every now and then again."

One was a tobacco shop where tobacco products were also manufactured - and, the raw material was grown in the yard.

I wonder if it was Old Toby or Longbottom Leaf?

One of them is this fast food restaurant, though, and not only because one can still get decent burgers there. It was founded by a real Elvis fan, and even the outside of the building tells to whom the place is dedicated. ;) Inside, there's all kinds of Elvis related stuff, and the walls of the toilets are papered with pictures of the King. They even used to have a jukebox with only Elvis records, but that one has probably been worn out because it wasn't there any longer.

"event","On Friday, I made a quick visit to Tampere, a city about 200 km north of Helsinki. Getting a hotel room was the only way to provide a place to stay overnight there for the older daughter who attended a Morrissey concert there; she had tried to get a room from a hostel, but they were all full. And, I didn't want to take the risk that she'd miss the last train homeward in the evening, and would have to find a place to stay until the first train in the morning would leave. 

Well, the trip provided a peaceful evening for me; I went to have a leisurely dinner, walked a bit in the city, and went back to our room to shower and pass the time reading.

It was a bit of a nostalgia trip as well. First, the hotel where we stayed was the same where my husband and I celebrated our 10th anniversary. Since then, it had been renovated, but kept very much to the old style. Second, right across the street from the hotel, there was a park where I played as a child when I was visiting my grandmother who lived on the other side of the park. Then, the playground wasn't as big and fine as it is now, but I never had problems passing my time there!

Here's part of the playground as it is today; Grandma lived in the yellowish stone house on the right.

The different political parties also arrange their own events, and there are some other traditions as well, like the May Day concerts. For several years now, we've attended the Helsinki Philharmonics May Day concert of lighthearted classics.

And on Saturday, there was another ""must"" concert that took me away from home for the night. The Tampere Philharmonics performed Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings Symphony, and since that was 200 kilometres away from home, the hubby and daughter and I stayed overnight at a very good hotel. The concert was great, and the weather was very favourable - this weekend has been like summer. So, it was an enjoyable trip by all means.

For a few times now, there has been a retro-style dance in the country not too far from us; and, the organizers got the idea of calling them the James Dance, from the jeans brand. The music and style is like in the early '60s, and a lot of people also dress in the style of that era. Most of the audience comes there for the music and dance, and the place can practically only be reached by car, so there are very few drunks, although they sell beer at the bar.

The hubby and I, together with a couple of friends, attended that dance yesterday evening for the second time. What a great opportunity to dress up and dance!

They had these bills up on the walls; I don't know if they're new in retro style, or copies of some original bill from the sixties. (Again, I only had my cell phone camera available.)

On Friday evening, there was a concert of songs by Joni Mitchell, especially her more jazzy stuff, arranged for a full symphony orchestra, and performed by two talented female jazz singers, again a couple of hours' drive from home. So, the hubby and I decided to make it another weekend of pampering ourselves a bit, and reserved a room for two nights at a good hotel at a walking distance from the concert venue to ourselves and daughter #2. (#1 sure enjoyed a weekend with her boyfriend without any parents around! :D ) The concert was good, and after it, it was nice to enjoy a couple glasses of wine and crawl to bed instead of having to drive back home, especially when the weather wasn't the best.

So, we had the whole Saturday just for relaxing. The hubby took the daughter for a long walk, and I went to see an exhibition that interested me at one of the local museums.

Earlier this year, I had purchased some things from Lush at more than 50 euros, and had got my choice of their gift packages thrown in. I chose the Serenity package, because it contained most shower stuff; but, there were some bath items as well - a bath bomb, a bubble bath slice, and a bath melt. And, we don't have a tub at home. But, I remembered that at least some rooms at the hotel where we were staying had a bathtub; so, I asked the hubby to get us a room with a tub if possible, and he did. So, I packed some Lush with me; and, in the evening, my daughter enjoyed a bubble bath, and I used the bath melt. Luxury!

At the museum, there's a permanent exhibition in addition to the changing ones. An important part of the permanent collection was gifted by a diplomat family that collected antiques while serving abroad during the first half of the 20th century. The lady of the house was fond of Madonna statues; the pictures of this week feature some items from her collection (sorry for the quality, the photos were again taken with my cell phone, and I couldn't use flash).

Yesterday, we went to an annual twang music (the Shadows - the Ventures style) festival in a town a couple of hours' drive away. The event is at a hotel where we of course were also staying, and as we still can't take the younger daughter to the concert with us - there's an age limit of 18 because it's at their club premises where they sell alcohol - the older one came along to watch over her while the hubby and I were away. The bands were mostly good, some of our friends were there as well, we had fun, but I've only slept for a few hours last night. So, guess who is going to hit the sack early this evening?

But, the lamp was already old at that point, and it wasn't of the best quality in the first place. During the years, the shade turned from white to brown and didn't let the light properly through anymore, so the room was quite dim even with the lights on. Recently, we got enough of the situation, and yesterday, we went and bought a new lamp. Now, it's up in the ceiling, and the lighting conditions of this room have vastly improved! We saved the old lamp for now, except the shade that broke when I took it off - it could still possibly be used somewhere, if a new shade could be found (which is uncertain with a lamp that's almost 20 years old).

The picture of this week features, well, snow. It snowed for a couple of days; at first, the snow was rather wet, and slid down the porch roof. At some point it froze, though, and the sheet of snow didn't break, but remained hanging from the edge of the roof like some kind of a curtain:

"event","So, on Wednesday, my two weeks of freedom were over, and work called. Fortunately, there wasn't such a pile waiting for me as I feared, but still enough to keep me busy for the rest of the week.

At home, we got a small improvement made. Our old kitchen chairs had started to fall apart, and we had been talking for quite a time that we should go and get new ones. So, on Monday, when the hubby and I were both on holiday, we headed for the furniture shops. And, we ended up buying not only new chairs, but a new table as well - the old one had been acquired to a very different kitchen, and although it was still good otherwise, it didn't quite fit into our current one. The new furniture arrived on Thursday.

And, in addition to work, there has been some fun as well. Yesterday evening, the hubby and I attended a surf and twang music concert at a club near his workplace. We had a nice evening, and were home around 3 am...


The photo of this week features my ""pets"": Dracella and Mr Fusspot.

Dracella flew to me all the way from Australia for Christmas; she was a gift from Donna, my TOB Secret Santa. As soon as I saw the dragon it looked like a female to me, and it took a while before I could come up with a name for her.

But, it actually took even longer to name Mr Fusspot. I got him last spring, and although I had read <i>Making Money</i> by then, the idea only came to me recently: he's small and ugly - just like Mr Fusspot. And, that was it. :D

"event","So, we've moved on to 2009.

We didn't have any wild party, but after being up until something like 2 am and not quite sober, I took New Year's Day easy. Slept late, and only dragged myself from the bed to watch the traditional New Year's Concert from Vienna. In my childhood and youth, it was a family tradition, and it has mostly continued through my adulthood. On some years, I actually didn't <i>watch</i> the broadcast, just had it on in the background while doing something else (or nothing).

In the past, I learned to recognise some of the musicians by looks, and could see how they changed over the years (""hey, there's that guy - my, he has gone grey!"") until they finally retired, and were replaced by younger musicians. And, the various conductors, some of whom had really great expressions... :D

Yesterday, after recovering, our family jumped into the car and drove to another city about 1.5 hours away, to see an interesting exhibition at the local art museum. It was about art, design, fashion, and music in the 1960s and 1970s - that is, the childhood and youth of the hubby and I. The art was actually rather good, as was the design (except those horrible trend colours of the '70s), the music mostly splendid (even the disco sounds good nowadays). But, the fashion, especially in the seventies! My, what horrors we wore in our teens!

As I said in my previous entry, I won't post a photo for every day this year, but rather, a Photo of the Week. This week, we've had great weather, sunny and cold, although there's still no snow. So, the picture of this week is of frosty branches in the midwinter sun.

On Monday, I visited my parents. This is the view from their balcony; I used to play and let the dogs run free on those cliffs. And even now, there was someone walking their dog - they appeared soon after I had taken the picture.

But, this weekend, we got to our favourite place for pampering ourselves again. We left on Friday; it was already getting dark, but there was still enough light for a picture from the road:

This time, the view from our window was a bit dull - the outside of the waterslides, and the University Hospital farther away:

Of course, we checked those waterslides from the inside, too. ;)

And, when we got home, I finally got a proper photo of the lanterns on the back porch.

What isn't so nice at this time of the year is that, it's dark when I leave in the morning, and dark when I get home. Hope we'll get snow this winter, though not quite yet.

I'm not suffering from a seasonal depression, I'm just so fucking frustrated.

He doesnt care. if he did he'd call. He'd let me know. No. Instead hes out with his friends having a grand ol' time while im home crying ot myslef. He doesnt care.

I found otu today that he lied abotu seeign a friend of his behind my back. he could just tell me. no. He had to go behind my back. I kow i would have gotten mad, but do you know how mouch more mad i am now that i know he lied about. he said he didnt, but who can i believe? There's no one to believe anymore. I'll try to stop caring so that i can maybe get some sleep at night, but when I try not to care, I just think more about how he doesnt. This is pointless. I knwo what I did was wrong. I think its annoying too when we fight. I've learned my lesson though...why cant he just call? If he doesnt call soon Im just gonna get mad again then he'll dump me. I hate myself. I hate people. All of them. They're jst out to ruin my life. LIFE SUCKS. Couldn't be worse then this. I wish he loved me like i love him. He'd know how hurt i was right now if he did."

"event","Helloooo everyone!

     As you all know by now i'm a bitch, but guess what?! I suddenly don't feel bitchy...well starting today. ha ha. But anyway, ya. I really think that from now on I'm going to be a happier person. So ya...this goes to ""steve's fed up friend"" I'm really sorry you wont be able to think of me as a bitch and leave random messages anymore...but dont worry, I'm sure you'll find someone else to bother :-D. Good luck.

Teeee heee. So anyway. I think a lot of it had to do with me constantly being around him...and stuff like that, but I suddenly dont feel the need to have him by my side every second. In fact today he asked to come over and I really dont think I'm going to have him over today. I mean I have a lot to do (chores...) and usually i put everything aside when it comes to him, but not today. Today I'm going to get the things I need done, done.  The thing is, I wasn't even trying to feel like this. I wasnt trying to let him have space...It just came to me...Whenever i try really hard to change myself, it doesn't work, but this time i wasnt trying and it just happened... I guess I've just realized that being with one person all the time can get in the way of getting things done. Especially important things...like this is a little far fetched, but how am I supposed to accomplish my most important goal of being somewhat wealthy if I'm always with steve nd never give myself time to get things done or get a steady job. You know what I mean? Well anyway I honestly think spending less time with him will stop a lot of the fighting :-D. I hope so anyway! Wish me luck...no wait, wish steve luck...lol.

So anyway, on a different note, I will soon be posting some wonderful pictures from last year so if you feel like it, give em' a look.

Also, I've noticed I dont get comments anymore... Is that because I've been happy? lol. It seems like whenever I write about my depression people say things, but otherwise my life is uninteresting...ha ha. o well. For those of you who take time from your day to read this and actually give me encouraging advice...THANX. That goes out to Kelsey mostly. LY even though I barely know you...lol.

See ya!

"event","Today was a good day. Finaly back in shop..YAY. It was like christmas today! we got our kits! How wonderful it was with all the jumbled mess of rollers,combs,and shears everywhere. Nothing beats cosmo. So anywayyy...My wonderful Stephen didn't have school today (YESSA!) so we went to the garage with the guys and they worked on the car a little bit...I stood in the cold with my pup. I wasn't in the mood to sand :-\...lol. Then we came back gave Romio a bath and played some SNOOD.

I'm going to the pet store tomorrow where I got Romio. I remember when I got him they told me he was s hort nosed pomeranian...and me being the idiot I am, I had no idea so I asked the difference and they told me the short nosed pomeranian's are smaller...(you know the cute little fluff balls...) well, it turns out I ended up wiht the long nosed pomeranian...the ones that are a bit bigger and instead of being fluffy their fur grows down and kind of smooth...So I called them up wondering why this dog that I payed (A LOT of money) for...out of my own bank account...wasn't the dog I was supposed to get. I'm attached to him now so obviously I'm nto gonna give him back, but i think i deserve some money back or something considering they gave me the wrong dog... h aha ha...weird. Well anyway, I'm going to sleep now.

YEEEEOOOO! (ha ha...)

I don't want him to break up with me, btu I deserve it if he does. I'll wait and see. I'm goingto give him space like he wants. I'll just leave him alone.

Hung out with steve, joey, JODY, and Justin on friday. Played pool, hackey sack...hung out. It was great.

I got a job as a secretary...It's ok I guess. At least I'll be getting more money now that I have two jobs.

Saturday I hung out with Nick G. Cat, and Dan. Went to McD's. ate. Went hoem played some pool...did the moon walk...washed teh guys' hair...styled it. ha ha. MUSIC. fun times.

"event","ok well...i guess you could say my life is good. and sure i guess you're right...but when you start thinking of the bad things they always seem to overpower the good. take my boyfriend for example. hes one of the nicest most normal fun people you'll ever meet...sp why do we get into so many arguments? Well the answer is me of course. I suck at relationships...well really i just suck in general. I mean ""its just a known fact"" that im ""overly jealous and quite a bitch about it most of the time"" (lynsey im not knockin you for sayuin it). It's the truth. I AM overly jealous...and quite frankly I AM a bitch...not just about my jealousy...just about everything. It's quite rare to find me n a good mood. and i hate that i've put steve through so much shit. i mean...i actually called a ""break"" cuz i wantged to go out and kiss someone..what else..oh ya i asked steve for permission to dance with some guys at a dance just for fun cuz i was bored and he wasn't there (my friends didnt want to be third wheels). There's more. Lets see.... well i had an anxiety attack when he hung out with Sammie...I really did...the whole time i was picturing him holding her hand or somehting stupid (thats just how my brain works) and when i did my heart would beat really fast my eyes would water and i'd have trouble breathing (call me a freak...a phsyco...whatever you wish. Its all true). So I actualy screamed as much as i could at him and made him come back. I hate my jealousy... I really do....not cuz its stupid...just because its embarrassing and i know i could lose steve over it... Please dont think that I enjoy putting steve through this. I dont. I love him and care about him...thats why i do it. but you know what? theres nothing i can do to fix it. i've tried. i tried to suck it all in when i tolkd him to hang out with sammie...i even told him an dtried to make him realize that I'm not worth it. I dont deserve him and he should just dump me. He wont though. he says he loves me. but then there's that issue... you know..i man I KNOW that every guy (every perso, rather) deserves thge right to hang out with their friends whenever they want and forget about their g/f for a day or two, but i dont like it. I think of a perfect relationship as always being together and loving it.....when he wants to be with his friends (girls or guys) I dont him to. I dont understand why he doesnt want to be with me...how i see it is he should lov eme and feel privledged to spend every day with me. ut he does'nt. He likes to be away from me for a few days....and it offends me. I dont like being away from him. That should flatter him. but instead he says ""yiou should have friends and hang otu with your friends"" i have friends...but i like to be home. and i like to be with him. I gree a lot of times we're bored, but for me its still wonderful to be able to be bored with HIM insted of with other friends or alone. So anyway.....Steve and I have different ideas of how a relationship should be. And a lot of people (including my therapist and me) believe that a relationship like that cant work if there cant be an agreement. So I tried to change for him....l I actually started seeing a therapist so I COULD change. Just for him (that should flatter him too but i never heard him say thanx about it). Anyway I've read a few of his friends journals.....and i know how they are...they're all very active people that have tons of friends who they all seem to find time for all of them and still maintain a life of school and work. Seems impossible for me. I mean it is cu ive tried....so maybe we shouldn't have met up? maybe i should never have told bobby to bring himj by the house so we could skate. its been a year and it makes me sad that i might have to end a relationship so great. I MEAN I DONT WAT TO. I love him. more then ive ever loved anyone. but i dont think he feels the same...or at least he feels it in a different way and he deals with relationships in ways i dont agree with....so what do i do? i cant change i tried. believe me its impossible. im giving up. but im never happy anymore...not cuz of steve....because of me. I'm a hoprrible person and i hate myself. I wish i could be like Sammmie and kelsy and even lyndsey. i wish i could be fun and outgoing. but im not.... i dont fit in with steve, his way of living his life...or his friends. i dont fit into this relationship. and it hurts me kinda...you know? well probably not. all i said is provably just a jumbled mess.....but now that i've finally been able to put all of this into words it hurts more then ever and its making me cry. I hate myself... my life."

"event","Seeing as I cannot get rid of my live journal I've decided to use it for some constructive purposes. For example my ""new"" livejournal's content will consist of ""Puppy Photo Gallery"", and recent news about my current life.

NEWS: 

As of today, I have a new puppy (Shakespears Romio, or Romio for short), I've had my permit for about 4 months, I finally finished driving school (besides my two last driving lessons, which will be on Thursday and Friday of next week), and I'm going to look at an 85 Pontiac Firebird on Tuesday of next week in hopes of buying it. Also, I've been dating my boyfriend for almost 11 months. Besides the few small flaws in my life, things are going great.

BREAKING NEWS:

My best friend who has been suffering for almost 16 years in a house full of unsupportive parents, younger siblings who torture her, and an unofficial job of practically being mother to these three younger children, has finally had her prayers of having a lucid, rational life answered. She is now beginning her new,happy, fun-filled life with her caring Aunt! Congratulations! I LOVE YOU!!

I Hope:

Someday I'll own a car so I can actually have a life!

That someday I'll have a life...

School this year will be different, better.

Life this year will be different...

That maybe this year...I'll be different...

That I'll be BETTER.


****Anyway, I will try to post Romio's pictures in the next entry."

I seen my own mother get wild
And in front of me she starts a whole crowd
My report card foul
D's and F's all the time
Hustle on my childhood mind
Through the eye's of a boy
I want to catch Santa Clause creep
And scare him when he thought I was sleep
So young in the heart, I want to be Billy Ray Valentine
Comin with the fly lines, for the ladies all the time
Filled with hope, they asked me did I like boats
Got sea sick and said nope
From the heart of a kid
I act just like I live
We ain't friends
I'm burnin that bridge, that's how it is"

They found it in on the freeway in Livermore, it couldn't hang on the freeway. They haven't even told me  if they have got the people who stole it, or if it's alright. The cop asked me ""How much is it worth,"" I was like ""It has a lot of sentimental value."" I'm bummed, it's cool though if they didn't catch them I hope the had to run a lot."

"event","Rip and I were driving on Mulholland one day before i left and Rip was chewing on a plastic eyeball and wearing a Billy Idol T-shirt and kept flashing the eyeball between his lips. I kept trying to smile and Rip mentioned somthing about going to Palm Springs one night before I left and I nodded, giving in to the heat. On one of Mulhollands most treacherous turns, Rip slowed the car down and parked it on the edge of the road and got out and motioned for me to do so too. I followed him to where he stood. He pointed out the number of wrecked cars at the bottom of the hill. Some were rusted and burnt, some new and crushed, their bright colors almost obscene in the glittering sunshine. I tried to count the cars; there must have been twenty or thirty cars down there.Rip told me about friends of his who died on that curve; people who misunderstood the road. People who made a mistake late in the night and who sailed off into nothingness. Rip told me that, on some quiet nights, late, you can hear the screeching of tires and then a long silence; a whoosh an then, barely audible, an impact. And sometimes, if one listens very carefully, there are screams in the night that dont last too long. Rip said he doubted that they'll ever get the cars out of there, that they'll probably wait until it gets full of cars and use it as an example and then bury it. And standing there on the hill, overlooking the smog-soaked, baking Valley and feeling the hot winds returning and the dust swirliong at my feet and the sun, gigantic, a ball of fire, rising over it, I believed him. And later when we got into the car he took a turn down a street that I was pretty sure was a dead end.

""Where are we going?"" i asked
""I don't know,"" he said. ""Just driving.""
""But this road doesn't go anywhere,"" I told him.
""That doesn't matter""
""What does?"" I asked, after a little while.
""Just that we're on it, dude,"" he said."

Just leave the presents and then leave me alone.

"event","Most of the summer i spent in stupor, sitting either in my office or in new restaurants, in my apartment watching videotapes or in the back of cabs, in nightclubs that just opened or in movie theaters, at the building in Hells Kitchen or in new restaurants. There were four major air disasters this summer, the majority of them captured on videotape, almost as if these events had been planned, and repeated on television endlessly. The planes kept crashing in slow motion, followed by countless roaming shots of the wreckage and the same random views of the burned, bloody carnage, weeping rescue workers retreving body parts. I started using Oscar de la Renta men's deodorant, which gave me a slight rash. A movie about a small talking bug was released to great fanfare and grossed over two hundred million dollars. The Mets were doing badly. Beggars and homeless seemed to have multiplied in August and the ranks if the unfortunate, weak and aged lined the streets everywhere. I found myself asking too many summer associates at too many dinners in flashy new restaurants before taking them to Les Miserables. My platinum American Express card had gone through so much use that it snapped in half, self-destructed at one of those dinners. The Patty Winters shows were all repeats. Life remained a blank canvas, a cliche, a soap opera. I felt lethal, on the verge of frenzy. My nightly bloodlust overflowed into my days and i had to leave."

Whats with young kids taking pills for A.D.D. just because they are being kids, what a joke.

Oh yeah so yesterday i'm on myspace looking at bulletions and one catches my attention because the headline said ""sex but a virgin??""
so i click on it and this is what i get.
""i had sex but im a virgin?
Because you opened this letter,something
good will happen to you at approximately
11:52p.m. If you don't repost this you'll
have bad luck for the next 1152 days.



Repost this with a title i had Sex but im a virgin



you have to do within 57 sec""
It's like WHAT THE FUCK, do you actually believe that if you do not repost a myspace bulletion that you will have bad luck, or see a dead girl, or you're mom will die? 

I was talking with my dad a couple night ago and he's fixed on the idea that the world is ending soon, call my dad a nut but he actually had good reasoning.
He was explaining to me how on the North and South Poles the glaciers that are holding the earth steady are starting to melt, and how an iceburg the size of california has broken off up there. The reason the iceburgs are melting is because the earth is getting closer to the sun that's why when we go outside now we get tan way easier than we use to. This is why all the hurricanes are happening and it's just the very beginning of hurricane season. All that crap has got me worried.


kinda, but not really,
mike"

"event","Upon being asked to describe life in prison, on death row, I always find it difficult to formulate sentences sufficient to show this ""inside"" existence to an ""outside"" free worlder.

Prison's true purpose is, of course, the control and subjugation of human beings. This necessarily entails the repression of basic freedoms and individuality. Rehabilitation? Forget it! Rehabilitation is merely a political placebo (which costs as much as a real remedy.) Actually, our prisons are a microcosmic representation of our society as a whole, exemplifying our country's social and power hierarchy, but without the velvet platitudes and conciliations. All prison officials are politicians of sorts; prison politics regulate power and status within the prison structure.

Such absolute power over human lives liberates the greed and prejudices latent in most prison officials. As a result, racism, bigotry, sadism and other evils are often unrestrained and overt in prison. (Some few individuals do, however, retain their humanity and decency, despite working in a prison.) As in free world society, the politics, corruption, abuses and injustices in prison all combine to bring misery to the powerless, only much more forcefully.

We are kept in constant confinement, locked in-cell all day long - except for the five days a week we are allowed one whole hour outside (in another, slightly bigger, cage). Cell temperatures are kept cold and breezy by powerful forced-air vents, yet permissible clothing is limited. All meals are served in-cell, on a filthy tray shoved through a slot in the door. Showers? For us, it's three times weekly. As for visiting, we are limited to two hours per week, with added physical restrictions: all death row visits take place in a 4' x4' separation booth, behind a barrier. (All this after prisoners' family, friends and attorneys' drive many hours to reach this remotely-located prison.) These conditions exemplify management's policies for us.

The guards contribute their own brand of misery to death row by utilizing a variety of slick tricks. The tampering and contamination of foods by guards occurs daily. Rushing activities, like meals or showers, is another favorite guards' tactic. (Ever try to eat 5-minute meals or take 5 minute showers on a constant basis?) The guards also employ tactical violence against death row prisoners under the pretext of lawful use of force; guards daily have their hand on our person (every time we exit the cell) to shove or pull us. (The two most common assault moves by guards are twisting handcuffs into wrists and slamming or shoving a prisoner face-first into walls and doors. The severest, outright beatings are reserved for the privacy of ""the hole,"" the disciplinary unit.) All these things go on with the silent approval of the prison management, which quite naturally encourages the guards to explore the limits of their ""discretion.""

One privilege granted to us on death row - with all prison officials' approval - is permission to buy and use televisions and radios. These items are generally approved because of the pacifying effect, and because they serve as a behavior control tool. As for approval to use a typewriter, on the other hand, and it is prohibited on some ""security"" grounds. (Or could it be that a typewriter can facilitate communication with supporters, with attorneys, and with courts?) As long as death row prisoners stick to the TV watching and are complacent, compliant and cooperative, they are, for the most part, left alone. Any one of us who is alive or outspoken - or, God forbid, litigious! - becomes a target, and catches hell.

Basically, prison officials' ""program"" for death row is designed to separate us from our humanity and dignity, while disrupting our access to outside resources and support. Nevertheless, death row prisoners, as a group, have less prisoner-on-prisoner and prisoner-on-guard violence than even the general population prisoners in this very prison.

The first major cause of stress and contention on this death row is the systemic pressure of official oppression. It is all very well designed to smooth the way to executions. Every day it's a struggle to keep focused on the important goal - fight for freedom and life! - while dealing with the officially-sanctioned harassment.

But, that's life on death row!

and lead a good clean life
so my children would be most happy
as would my dear and loving wife

Each day will be so beautiful
with love and harmony at home
i will be sober and dedicated
no more the urge to roam

everything went along quite smoothly
until one day i arrived home from work
walked in on a family rukus
and was immediately called a jerk

my calm was completely shattered
i had no time to think
so i went into the kitchen
and poured a powerful drink

The shouting went on unabated
it seemed polly had to have the car
i was told to keep my mouth shut
so i took off for the nearest bar

next morning dawned cold and grey
my head was in a spin
amy said i always favored polly
i knew that i could'nt win

Things went from bad to worse
they said my drinking was the cause
but even when i was sober
the bitterness didnt pause

I went to see my neighbor
an upstanding family man
seeking a little wisdom and advice
that i could understand

I thought his wife looked unhappy
his kids quite glum and grim
he'd had two beefeaters on the rocks
i'd met another man who couldnt win

So now i try to keep my peace
be silent and hold my tounge
and find my comfort and solace
with a touch of the demon rum

But i do make this pledge to my family
that when my time is up and i pass away
i'll not touch another drop
until they bring me back on judgement day"

"event","I'm wasting time thinking about a girl
And stealing her away from her world
She and I would run away
I think of all the things that I'd say

We'd talk about important things
And I picture it in my dreams
She'd teach me about modern art
And I'd show her it's okay to fart and

Maybe I'd impress her
By being in a band and
Maybe if I act real tough
She'd let me hold her hand and
Maybe I'll win her heart
By writing this song about her

Sometimes I sit at home and
Wonder if she's sitting at home
Thinking of me and wondering if I'm
Sitting at home, thinking about her
Or am I just wasting my time

Remembering how she laughed at Kinko's
When I made fun of that guy
Remebering the look she gave me
When I told her that I used to fry

I really want to ask her out
But my ego could never take it
And even if I got the balls
You know that the Cougar would never make it

And in my town you can't drive naked

And maybe I'd impress her
By being in a band and
Maybe if I act real tough
She'd let me hold her hand and
Maybe I'll win her heart
By writing this song about her

Sometimes I sit at home and
Wonder if she's sitting at home
Thinking of me and wondering if I'm
Sitting at home, thinking about her
Or am I just wasting my time

Am I just wasting my time
Am I just wasting my time
Am I just wasting my time
Wasting my time thinking about a girl"

Haha we had fun we kind of got tired of eachother but he's funny. Then i came back home for Christmas, Christmas was alright. The day after Christmas i went to berkely with Christina and Johntay it was fun except when Christinas car swallowed my cell phone. Uhm i got in trouble again and had to find a place to stay so i house hopped between Marios and Johnnys houses. We had fun for the most part. Me, Johnny, Brian, and Mario went to Mondos and had a little barbque haha we all got so drunk it was a blast Mario flipped out and hit me and Brian in the face, haha.

Anat...made up my test, but i only got an 86. I hope that brings up my tests average (probably not) BUT i got a 92 on my excretory test. So maybe it went up. Finished my project in one night, i think i did well on that too. So my grade should go up significantly (not to mention i still havea  zero that she ahstn updated yet :).

Math...needs to die. I am not good at it. Its my weakness. but i NEEEEED an a in htere. I got a 93 on the cumulative, but a 78 on a logarithm test. However, there is one more test and a final. BRING IT ON. Matt, youre going to have to help me.

So here are the assignments as stands:

-Write Literary analysis over mice and men (quotes, cites, characters)
   ~Thesis: No life should be disrespected, underestimated, or disregarded.

- Study reproductive system for test (easy)

- Study spanish for test wed. (hard)

- Study math really hard because i suck. SO CLOSE THOUGH

- over break...
   ~Write five page paper on Darkenss at Noon
   ~Write paper answering 50 philosophical questions on Sophies World
   ~Do 3 maps for map test day back from school
   ~Do that other thing.


So i got my work cut out. AT least i caught up from everything from tuesday.

"event","Had a great day. A spectacular day. Until i get home. I mean right when iget in the car BAM. Yelled at. Its out of sheer ignorance. Yes this is a vent.

EOCT is coming. Whoop dee do. She doesnt understand how stupid it is to worry about that.

I have some 0's on i parents because i wasnt here tuesday. Yeah get yelled at for those because i hadnt turned them in yet. EVEN THOUGH I STILL HAVE GOOD GRADES.

Im an idiot who loses things (getting much better) and has teachers who hate late things *two minutes late*. Then im an idiot who doesnt keep track of dates of tests. I know when the important ones are. Does anyone care??? noooo. Then she doesnt believe me when i say i know teh material. 

What kills me though, is last week she told me she wouldnt care about my grades anymore. That she wouldnt yell at me for them anymore. That if i failed I would beat myself up enough without her on my back. That if i never got a good job or went to college and lived on the streets its my fault. Well you know what?? LIES.

So i guess all in all im a disorganized, forgetful, absent, sensitive, arrogant girl. Well you know what? Screw her, im going next year, and ill get away from all this. She cant get me there. Man i love her then i despise her. I know that no one has faith in me yes, except myself. Im fine with that. Just dont let me know it. I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF THANK YOU VERY MUCH!! TRUST ME DAMNIT!  

Oh to top it off, i may have to cancel any plans i have or would have because im an idiot who hsa to keep her nose in hte books all day for a  test you cant study for, damn eoct. I wish i could drive....

Well enough self pity and putting myself down crap. Im going to yell a rebuttal then cry some more. Mayb ei can at least get her not caring about tomorrow. good night."

"event","<P>Amazing but kinda bad day but amazing. Okay. I got up ten minutes early and did everything in time, it was awesome. I felt pretty kinda. Then went to lit, i think i did well on my quiz because i finished this time. Then i read mice and men more. Ill go into that later. Next we went to anatomy, I DISSECTED A PIG HEART!!! Sadly morgan and i got the runt pig so it was like small. Then went to spanish. Got a b on my project and quiz, that disapointed me A LOT. I really wanted all a's and now i prob have an 89 or 88. Ill just have to try extra hard. Its not her fault, its mine. I got off the spanish track today. Alg. II was nice. I talked to other people a lot. Met a nice senior named ali nad a nice junior named Chris. I think i just need to practice a little more on this chapter and i got it. i can do this.</P>
<P>So i decided to get organized today. Lets see here. College credits so far:</P>
<P><U>Science:<BR></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - biology honors (93)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Anatomy and Physiology honors (89 and pending) <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Chemistry honors (next semester)</P>
<P><U>English:</U><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 9th lit honors (91)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Am. Lit honors (89 and pending but she hasnt updated since forever)</P>
<P><U>Math:<BR></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Alg. I (88)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Geometry (94)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Algebra II (89 and so pending, bringin it up baby)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Advanced Algebra Trigonometry (next semester)</P>
<P><U>Social Studies<BR></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Honors world History (88)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - AP European History (next semester)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sociology (hopefully next semester)</P>
<P><U>Foreign Language:<BR></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Spanish 1 (90)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Spanish 2 (91)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Spanish 3 (some B, but im bringing it up too!)</P>
<P>Okay, so thats pretty good, but some isnt yet finished so i cant count it. That means i still need more social sciences and sciences itself (medical) and then a bunch more maths, so that means calc junior year (if here) but if not then ill doulbe up senior year and finish with AP calc. Science, ill take chem next semester, then if here next year (if not senior year) ill take physics in&nbsp;fall and AP biology in spring. Social studies ill just keep going, i dont know whats coming my way. English i would be taking AP language next year but if im not here ill just go along with wahtever, ill prob doulbe up on that too because its important for college. </P>
<P>Here is my list of extracurricular activities:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Hippotherapy a long time ago<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Science club (shoot me)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Tennis (done)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Tutoring (while ago, i think il start back up)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Okay, so i need more. A lot. I think ill join the magazine that is starting at our school. Its new so there sinta&nbsp; group to mesh into, and my pictures will be like in color once a month and not in one big yearbook. I hope i follow through on this. Maybe ill start tutoring again at lost mountain or something. Then maybe ill be in crew for a play. OOOO Then im going away a year!! that should look really good! </P>
<P>Next ill add onto my amazing day. I came home and i talked to my mom an hour. She told me all about her experience with the school investigation. There are such amazing intelligent kids out there who arent given a chance or have no hope. Be it from family, schools, or self doubt. All tehy need is someone to believe i them. Makes me want to be a teacher, or a resource teacher. I know that once im a doctor, and can definitely provide for myself, i want to be a no profit medic in poverty stricken areas. Imagine how much impact taht could have. My mom also told me about how people are ignorant and arogant adn can just be plain stupid. I admit i realized i officially hate 3 people today. Theyve never done anything to me, but how they treat others, i hate them. I hate brent, i hate bryce and i hate that kid whos bryces friend with red hair. He sure is ugly. Man, they make em so mad.</P>
<P>Read mice and men again today, i think ill be one who cries from reading that. Its revoking these memories i really wanted to suppress until i died. As i read i noticed that ive done everything that man has to Lennie. Makes me feel awful, but in that i know its good that its making me think about it. If charlie ends up living with me until he dies, that will be just fine with me. If anyone judges me on that or leaves me because of that, then they arent worth my time. But that book is so amazing. I just hate hate hate hate how brent is just... GAH. God, we will just finish reading it, then someone will ask why Lennie did something adn brent will be like ""because hes retarded, idiot"" Im gonna smack that boy. </P>
<P>All in all, i greatly dislike certain types of people. The ones mom told me about, and the ones like the people mentioned earlier. BRyce adn red head kid were talkinga bout how they were beating up soe boy, and tehn bryce was bragging on how he was trying to beat up a neighbor of mine who ran away from him. If i ever see them beat up anyone, i will beat up bryce. Hes short, i can take him, the other kid i dunno. This is brent a by the way. No one reads this but clarifying so i dont mess up anything. </P>
<P>A person cant change someone else because tehy want to, they have to be an example and maybe the rest will follow.</P>"

A little boy walks in the room,
the people stand and cheer,
he smiles broad but no one sees,
he was overcome with fear.

He returns home, takes off his mask,
then settles into bed,
but before he lays his head to rest,
this is what he said,

""Please God, make the whole world blind,
all inside and out,
so no longer must i wear the mask,
so i will no longer be in doubt.""

The sun rises, rooster crows,
he gets up from his sleep,
he wears the mask of deviance,
people know what he will reap.

He's off the school, tack on the chair,
teacher screams, the kids all laugh,
they expect it from this boy,
having not seen the other half.

He returns home once again,
sets aside his face,
then by his bed he gives a sigh,
and prays with angel's grace,

""Please God make the whole world blind,
all inside and out,
so no longer must i wear the mask,
so they know waht im about.""

Next morning he put on no mask,
walked out in the sun,
smiling face, charismic laugh,
then other's came undone.

All masks were taken off that day, 
all played as who they are,
no one didn't get along,
the boy truly set the bar.

That night the boy went home from play,
and kneeled there once again,
that smile never left his face,
for that day he didn't feign.

""God don't make the whole world blind,
then no one could see,
the beauty in each other's soul,
or what we all can be.""

PS: ILL SHOW ALL OF YOU!! I am going to get all a's, and then im going to flaunt it!!!"

"event","blah blah blah. Work work work. Eearly release tomorrow. Fun fun. Found the secret to school. Never let hw or work overcome you, you must overcome it. Make it a joke or game (i sound stupid) or i do it to get it over with. dont get all emo about it, get it done adn it goes away. I has achieved wisdom! yay sam! Ive been all weird lately. I dont know why, i snapped at another person today. I hate when people ask over adn over and over and over. Just no. then some girl had a seizure in lunch, made my lunch ten minutes late, but thats okay, i felt bad for the girl. Then there was a crash outside school so we got home late too. I need to stop being a Harrison girl. That staereotype is starting to apply to me also. Eh i wont give in. I AM NO CLONE!!

The days of old have long since passed,
though most still crave to be,
the one who lived within the mud,
and danced around in glee.

The one who laid in sunbeams,
who jumped in fallen snow,
who never cared what people thought,
nor where their life will go.

The spirit cheered up every soul,
with antics of a child,
and in  mind, could grasp no fear,
having thoughts not yet defiled.

She showed the big dog who was top,
she skipped upon the creek,
befriended birds who sang along,
as her soles danced to the beat.

Her mind pure as new fallen snow,
her heart as true as love.
Her soul was that of angels grace,
her eyes as skies above.

Everyone loses who they were,
although it never leaves,
it's still there, but most forget,
time doesnt tire as it weaves."

"event","Man, worst day following a bad day. Im not letting it get me down. Im to the point of really not hiding so much from people anymore. So yeah, walked into hr. Was told i looked like crap by brutally honest friends. Told i looked like death. Then taht i looked like i wasnt wearing a bra. Okay, i was everyone. Just a damn thin one. So i worried about that all day. Then also in hr i realized, ""oh stupid stupid sam forgot to put in gel today"" so i went around with my hair gone wild naturally. Then my sweater got stretched out so the normal button i keep it on made it look like i was emaciated and cant keep clothes from slipping off so i had to button it one more which seemed too much. Eh sue me. 

Still in a good mood though... still in a good mood. Then the bus windows kept breaking so delay in getting home. Butt load of hw. About 80 math problems. Spanish quiz tomorrow. Have to read about 5 emily dickens poems and answer about 12 questions for each. Eh, its life, and schools almost out for break, so im going to enjoy it until then. Lord knows when schools gone ill be unchallenged and bored. Good news. 95 on anatomy test!!! Should bring up my av.

I kinda snapped at brittany today. Sometimes i just wanna walk alone. I said im sorry though, hope shes okay. it wasnt too bad. I just didnt give her my air head. Oh, and i htink i failed a math test. Why?? because im a moron who cant work up to her ""full potential"" Well you know what? People underestimate my full potential so wheni surpass theirs ill screw them over. Lol, i sound so mad when i write in this when really its more a vent book. I really am pretty hapy, headache but happy. Loves. 

Different meanings to every line,
human perception is never divine,
think they know just what i mean,
but past my mind's eye never seen.

One's reality can never be grasped,
by minds whose ignorance cannot by bypassed.
Think you get me? try once more,
Ill change the game, you want some more?

Too many facets to comprehend,
too many doors none can transcend.
Dont think you know just what i feel,
what you assume will then be real."

"event","Well, started off being an awesome day. Church, home alone, hw (im not kidding, it was awesome). No one was home. Then everyone came home. So i secluded myself to my room once more. I feel so bad for max. i love him so much, but hes left behind. just like me. Left behind...but not. So hard to explain. He had his recital thingie at a restaraunt today. He was so excited and happy. Then we all got in the car and all started fighting. They all seem so nice sometimes but sometimes we all just kill each other. Like when matt was with us last night, everyone was so nice to each other, then tonite everyone was just, we were awful. Eventually max said ""cant we all just stop fighting for this one night?? please?"" and of course we didnt. Saw the family, masks went back on in the restaraunt and we were a happy family. 

Also on the way there, charlie wouldnt stop talking about his stupid wretsling. Normally i can ignore it, but it was max's nite. We hear about him ALL the time, for once give max some attention. Max seemed upset kinda. But he didnt say anything. The restaraunt was so boring. I tried to cheer max up. Didnt seem to work well. I was stuck at the end of the table, so i didnt talk. Charlie kept drawing attention to him self because not everything was focused on him tonite. Max performed and did spectacularly. He came backt to the table, and NO ONE said good job to him. He sat down at the end of the table with me and started playing with his napkinda again. NO ONE congradulated him, NO ONe gave him a pat on the back. So, i said ""max you did really well, im very proud of you."" and he looked up in a sense of shock and smiled and said ""thank you very much"" Jeez, i know exactly how he feels, but if i were him i admit, ide be crying. Then on the way back, mom talked to charlie teh whole time while he watched his performance on hte camera. THEN she said good job to him. Mom talked to cahrlie about friends at school adn crap. Then mom and i sang a girl scout song (highlight of my night) and then mom started getting onto dad for never doing ANYTHING with us when we were little. How we had no father for a long time to help. How he dedicated NOTHINg. I felt kinda bad for him, but shes right. And since hes so passive, he didnt say anything. 

Glad i got this all out. A lot of the time i wish we were happy like we sometimes are all hte time, but that always ends up an act. Its so rare that we all really get along without a guest. No, when its mom, me and max it always works out great. We all get along perfectly.

In other news: mom officially wants to send me to a siblings workshop. She wants to send me and max to some therapy crap because of how we are towards charlie. Why are all my entries on him??????? GAH. She buys me all these stupid books for siblings of kids with special needs. I want to burn them, i never read them. Ive just given up and become cold and spiteful, and gave up on asking for things because it will never get around to happening. Max is forgotten and hardly talks anymore except to me. I need to stop talking about charlie. WHY DOES MY FUCKIN LIFE REVOLVE AROUND HIM????? it shouldnt. o well, my journla , my vents. good nite.

Cute quotes i found:
~I get the best feeling in the world when you say hi or even smile at me because I know, even if its just for a second, that I've crossed your mind.

~""They that love beyond the world cannot be seperated by it. Death cannot kill what never dies.""

~ ""Cute is when a person's personality shines through their looks. Like in the way they walk, every time you see them you just want to run up and hug them.""

Last one is my fave. Its so true. There are people i just look at (even if girls) and am just liek ""you are so cute"" and they look at me weird, but its not sexual at all. Like puppy cute."

Went to play, really really good, but really really sad...

about this girl who had polio and everyone was mean to her because seh was different adn they wouldnt talk to her and made up rumors about her. Then some kids beat her up and took her wheel chair adn leg braces. I almost cried. Then her overprotective parents were giving her a hard time about leaving because tehy were overprotective and the mom called her cripple. Definitely almost cried there too. Then the boy who was supposed to take her to prom didnt because hes ashamed of her. That play really hit home for me. Most people in that room may not know it, but that is raelly the way thigns are. People gasp when the mom called her cripple yet leave the theater saying ""retarded"". Wow im too sensitive.

Then Jake was on the bus and kept saying ""retard"" to lauren and i and i just ignored it and lauren started saying ""dude arent you gonna slap him?"" and i was like ""no"" and he said ""why would you?"" and i said ""just nevermind"" and looked out the window and lauren just kinda watched me and said ""jake, if you think about it you may realize why she would"" and then he waslike ""fine since yall wont tell me, youre beinga  retard"" and by then i really was gonna turn to him and say ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" if he said it one more time. just one more. But he got off the bus, and lauren said he realized it because he looked at her and mouthed ""oh shit..."" right before he got off. Ive known everyone in my neighborhood since like 4th grade, and parents know each other, so everyonein the neighborhood knows. I HATE BEING SO DAMN SENSITIVE. Its a fact of life, my brother is stupid, and i cant cahnge it or let what tohers say get to me so why do i?? 

Nikki is awesome, i love her, so is ansley and jessie. Lauren is awesome too but busy. Morgan is awesome times fifty. I love my friends a whole lot. Even though im not in any of anyones classes, they dont forget me. I love you all.

Weekend: Im going with kat to barnes and noble tonnite. Awesome, i need a new photo album. 
Saturday: i should be going to the movies with matt and ryan and holly and then maybe matt adn i can go to the play. Well, im going no matter what. I promised. Then church sunday, and i think thats it. lates.

A zero on a notebook, but she let me number the pages (all i missed, bitch) and turn it back in. Im really starting to get scared about next semetser. Sacrifices may have to be made. Itll be a challenge, but thats what i love. The feeling of being so worn out you cry, then turning in a project and gettinga  good grade on it. 

Kats making me really sad, but i cant change her choices. I shouldnt worry, im getting over it. I realized, most people have done worse things than i know however everyone is much more similiar to me than i had thought too. Thats pretty cool. 

For some reason ive been gnawing at my nails like CRAZY lately. I dont really know why, something must be bugging me. I can think of a few but i dont know if those are it. They hurt really badly. Damn habit.

All my classes just keep getting better and better. My grades are going down a little, and i really reaslly really really need to bring them up. I hate saying that in front of people because most have lower grades, but i mean, im not them, im sam. I dont compare myself to others anymore and i know im capable of more. I wish i could just wake up... 

162/672. that damn number is my class rank. I am not happy with it. I know people higher than me and i just irritates me how some people are taking lower classes nad getting higher gpa's.  That stupid class rank is what colleges look at. maybe it was 169, well somewhere in there. That pisses me off. Im gona show them. GAH. No really its okay.

"event","Bad  day yet good day so i guess it was a neutral day. This morning i straightened my hair only to walk out into the fog adn FLOOSH!! Then my shirt sucks, and the only white cammy i could find had a massive stain on it, but i used a shoutl wipe and had no time to change, so there was a massive wet mark. Wore my scarf, kinda annoying. 

Lit: tests got cancelled, this had to be one of the best parts of the day. Watched a movie instead. Good.

AnPH: Awful. Morgan wasnt there, and all the other upperclassmen had their groups. So i got stuck with this ben kid and smitty. They are nice guys, didnt be mean to me or anything, and talked to me too. However, when we wree doing the pain receptor one (i stayed in there 9:10 minutes, more than anyone, i win) they just walked off adn did two labs without me. Assholes. They wouldnt go back to them either so i didnt get them done. 

Span: thats a good class, finished my test, and oral. Not as well as i would have hoped, but not bad. I hate orals, i can never recall words. that was fine. 

Lunch: talked to jessie and ansley and brittany and liz and amanda. Liz decided not to go trick or treating with me, because she has no desire to. I think shes teling the truth, honestly. I can tell when people lie. If she is lying, i will be pissed, and i dont get pissed often. So my weekend is completely free. However, Jessie and i are in hte process of making plans for saturday nad sunday, i dont mind sitting at home. Maybe ill hang out with katherine, i need to. Sometimes i wish so badly i had jst one bset friend since like kindergarden who lived clase and was a girl. Even a boy, its like, they will always be there for you and dont care about school and stuff and can see yiou at school everyday. But sadly, i cant have that, damn moving, damn jobs, damn bad luck with people who change..

Alg: took a test, sucked majorly. I hope i did a good job, i need a good grade. 

Bus: Chris sucks, he ruins my day even though i know hes not serious. What gets to me is when he jokes around with friends and such about people, i know tehy may take it seriously. Their fault, i know, but it just still gets to me kinda. 

For halloween, jenna wants me to go with her and some of her friends whom i know trick or treating, but i dont like intruding. Lauren is going with this other friend of  hers and i dont want to intrude on that either. Besides, i keep getting the feeling she doesnt want me to. Im fine with that...i think. Everyone is so busy all weekend. I mean i could be doing a whole lotta stuff, but im choosing not to. I could be going to larissas party, and i still dont know if i am, and i got another invite to a girl named sarah's party whomi barely know. I probably wont go ot that. Well see. 

Matt was supposed to call today when i was at school. I was kinda lookin forward to it and with the day i kinda hoped for it. Sadly he didnt. I mean, i didnt really get my hopes up, not many people remember stuff like taht. O well. With some people, no one in particular, i wish that when they said somethign they would follow through on it. Liz shoulda folowed through on our plans, it woulda been cool had matt called (im not mad, dont worry), and i mean, just various people. Lates

Final note: i hate pms, ive been mean all week. Im just going to wait this weekend out."

"event","Today, bset day in a long time. Mom returns today. I managed to be a recluse in my room and stay away from people. Else ide hurt somoene.  Damn pms. But yes, i shall do this in list format...

1) homeroom: talked to Alex and Nikki outside. Came in, JESSIE came to see us! Now about 5 people come to our hr a day to see niki and i (yes were loved) but jessie never did, nad she did today!! (i told her whre it was yestrerday) She let nikki borrow these awseome glasses for hr and then i got them until lunch to return to her. I was a cop/drug dealer/motorcyclist/hiding from the paparazzi! So awesome. 

Lit: Had a sub and busy work, talked to kelli, ali, steven, jake, and i think thats about it. Eh, theyre cool. Said some REALLY stupid things though, i think i looked like an ass, but tahts oaky, gave ali a good suffocating laugh so i guess its worth it. Too much busy work though.

Anat: Wow, had a blast with Morgan and the glasses. Audrey and Erin had me cracking up during a movie along with morgan. We are in the very back, so its all good. Awesome fun.

Spanish, took test, i think i did well. She didnt get to me when oral came around though. (YESSS) Im getting to know a lotta people in there slowly. Much happier. 

Alg II- Chase kept talking to me, but for some reason im so mean in that class. Thats okay though, i mean he makes fun o me too, but hes stupid. Talked to cory a little, i just learned he rides my bus. craziness. Im so isolated in that class, very far corner against the wall. two walls. and kellie is never there anymore, so all i have to talk to is cory adn chase. Save me. Teacher came up to me thinkign i was a junior and asked about AAT and i told her i was a sophomore, but seh still wants me to. I thinki should, itll be good. 

Home: on the bus, everyone had windows open and thne it started raining hard outta nowhere adn everyone pushed each other down to close em. Walked home in the rain, got really wet really fast, its hot though so its cool. Went with Lauren to Joes. I dont like that place, okay food, bad everything else. Went to laurens adn did some of her hw. Fun stuff.

Im gonna crash next semester.....
-Chemisty honors
-AP european History
-Advanced Algebra Trig
-(elective) sociology *hopefully*

I guess ill have my work cut out for me. ....Bring it on. crap, tests tomorrow: spanish oral/second part, The Raven nad House of Usher quiz, Algebra Two chapter test. Guess i should study, later!!!"

"event","A painter's brush across the sky,
Two lover's watch, then give a sigh.
A bird soars by the piercing beams,
as adults return to childrish dreams.
Forgotten are illusions and the lies.

The sun drowns in a crystal sea,
light dances on waves, so happy and free.
The sky is flooded with an august array,
children sleep, awaiting the day,
for they determine what it will be.

The ocean vies against the sun,
the sun is taken, the ocean won.
The sun expresses a last adieu,
setting fire upon the oceans' hue,
fire goes out, the night's begun.

shadow floods the twilight face,
stars fly out from horizon lace,
a dusky breeze caresse tender hearts,
young lover's watch as darkness starts, 
they fall asleep in warm embrace.

A little girl, not yet of age,
stares out her starry window stage,
she sends her wishes to a star,
her hopes, her dreams, to that afar,
trusting it will assuage.

One lover wakes, catches the moon,
her heart plays a melodious tune.
She views her fellow, sleeping sound,
grateful for him this life round,
wishing time frozen this blue moon.

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,
time continues with everlasting thrust,
even on a night as this,
as cherishing the evening bliss,
the sun will rise, as always just.


Wow, thats better than most in awhile. Im glad. I think the words are in the incorrect order in some of them, but thats okay, its poetry. This one makes me happy. Im starting to notice my poems have a theme, but i wont go into that. I still need to fix those grades. Im getting so frusterated with them. Dad is driving me nuts but im dealing, max is worse off than me. I really need to get some sleep tonite, i think ill ge tto bed at like 9:30 if possible. For some reason everyone keeps saying i look nice/complimenting me recently. I dont feel different, i dont think i look different. Neato! Maybe im growing up! I TOLD YOU ALL I WOULD BE PRETTY ONE DAY! lol God, im always gonna see myself as the sixth grade ugly girl, and im fine with that. I could be some supermodel (HAHAHA) and ide still see myself as 6th grade. So sad. O well. Lates."

like clouds up in the sky,
some friends can change overnight,
but lose ability to fly.

I've seen them change, mostly for worse,
few change for the good,
but me, i choose to keep myself,
and stand where no one's stood.

I'll never change, ill remain me,
through darkness and through light,
through setbacks and advances,
as others lose the fight.

Dont like it? tough, i just don't care,
Those who keep themselves go far,
unless its for their self-advance,
myself i shall not mar.

Ill keep my wings, you can cut yours,
I'll fly above your head,
as you stay within the crowd,
who clipped their wings instead.

To fit in is good, but oh contrare,
is it worth the price?
To have shackles clatter at your feet,
your self in eternal ice.

Me, ill fly, both near and far,
though no one thinks me fit,
Ill glance and say ""i told you so,
I told you i'd do it!""

Im wanting something more than this,
somethign that's much more vast,
and when i leave this world behind,
my name will still outlast."

"event","Im rather happy. Yay for sam. I STILL have 89's in my classes and i still need em up. Mom kinda yelled at ema  little for it, but i think that was because she was just really stressed. Poor mom, shes gone now. Guess il just write my sanity while i have it. I wont be at church this week. Nope, no ride, and mom wants me home to help charlie.

Yes, charlie, i have to help him study for his cell test. Sometimes i hate how special he is, sometimes i think its a learning experience. So many emotions, so little space. I wish i had one person who would understand sometimes. One person who knew waht i was going through, one person who i could talk to. With a brother with Down's who is my bros age or older. No, im wishing now. I just need to help him to help my mom, and im not putting up with any crap. I officially hate the word ""retard"" with the most loathing passion ever. I want it to die. I hear it so much, so very much. This one kid in alg. said it three times in one period. I mean it isnt just him describing someone, he was also like ""youre acting like a r-----."" to chase. Why do people use it? there are so many other words. Why choose that one? why am i so sensitive to it? Why do i care? I remember in 5th grade some little kid came up to me when we got off the bus and said ""this kid just called your brother a ""retard"""" and i turned and said ""tell him that no one calls my brother that but me!!"" God i hate my past. Who doesnt? Truth is i was trying to seem like i didnt care, i didnt want people to think me sensitive, i wanted to be ""cool"". I was such a dumbass. 

There are many things i wish i hadnt said when iwas trying to be ""cool"". Truth is, i was, i honestly was, and i think i wanted to uphold that. When I realized that it wasnt important adn i was denying myself, i started saying waht i believed, no, more like i stopped talking. I wish i had a time machine. O well.

My mom is really stressed, and i dont want her to have to worry about taking me. However, she wont let me call a neighbor and i have to waitt ill 8:30 because thats when she takes max to his ortho appt. I feel kinda bad. She has to worrya bout leaving, and about charlie and max and their hw and dad and just a lot. I really dont want her to leave. She has to do something with special ed. Dads in charge (shoot me now) and shes frusterated because dad doesnt know how to do anything around here. Hes not aroundenough to know what we like, dislike, how old we are...etc. Lets hope i dont snap, ill just stay outta the house. 

There wasa  sermon yesterday at chruch by this texan fellow. He was asking those who were ""not right with God"" to raise there hands then worked their want of acceptance and they went all the way down there. I personally do not think that was fair. That is waht we have that thing for when people go up at the end. I know Im going to heaven, i got off track pretty badly awhile ago, but im pretty set now. At least i think so. I admit, i am not able to fidn Bible books as fast as everyone else, nor do i know the stories, but i know God loves me. Through curses and blessings. He sends his curses to you for a reason, be it wath im not sure, dont question it. It's just that some of his blessings are overlooked. I admit, my belief in christianity is slightly different from the orthodox ones, but doesnt mean he loves me any more or less. All in all, i did not like that method of preaching, the sermon was good, but playing peoples doubts and then their cares about others thoughts and using that to manipulate them down, i didnt like that. Im sure some people were really sincere, but i also bet a lot didnt want to go down there, but just stand. Gotta go yall, lates."

"event","Yes, this world is so sublime,
most lose it to the sands of time,
Each grain itself once done is lost,
but no one seems to get its cost.

Every glass has different grains,
some more, some less, and as it rains,
One knows not when glass will shatter,
then to all walls the sand shall scatter.

Like Spartans at war, or animals at bay,
nothign on earth can stand in their way.
Their patterns can be help in a frame of mind,
as memories hidden, most left behind.

A more permanent wall, a barricade,
can capture the scene is a august array,
a photo is taken and in it is held,
laughs, hugs, and tears expelled.

A child's smile when flying a kite,
a campfire circle under pure moonlight.
A dancer whos grace is as clean as teh sky,
A pensive lover as sunset is nigh.

But as sand, like most thigns, slips through fingers, 
The picture can fade, but the image still lingers.
A memory is lost to the wear and tear,
as stuffed animals give out after too much care.

I guess time cant be fenced, nor captured in paper,
but is as  perceivable as a fictional vapor,
difference is time is very well real,
just somtimes this bliss can just be so surreal."

I thought i had a low b in lit but i guess not, i still need to get that up while i can. Spanish, thats up, in the bag. Anatomy, dtermined by tomorrow. Alg. II, already up, 95 on midterm baby!!! Lit....never has been my strong suit. im not the best reader, and my writing has never been easily understood. I cant complain about this stress though. I signed up for it. I want it. I also want a job. Why cant i do all i want?? Damn self and damn time. I need more time. I dont have enough. It comes and goes too fast. 

I know waht college i want to go to. I want to go to UNC Chapel Hill. However, its going to be a massive challenge. AVerage HS gpa there is a 4.14 and around 50% accepted are in the top 10% of their class. I guess i have my work cut out for me. Bring it on. I can do this. My fear is not enough extracurriculars. I will always have Emory is go back on, but still. Perhaps i do want an in state, to keep in touch with friends and family. Besides, Emory is easier to get into, but i thnk more expensive... things will work out. I have tiem to think about it, but not time to accomplish all i want. I envy those who do so many things and still seem to have spare time. I think im just slower. Stupid analyzation and ADD. Sometimes i just want to kill it. I hate arguing with myself on this crap. 

Saw a lotta people today, was also outgoing. twas nice. I hardly ever get to see anyone anymore, no one has my classes nor route. Thats okay, maybe next semester, besides tis gives me a chance to make new friends also, which is working great. Even at church, i break away from people and meet new ones. Service group im getting to know jennefer and that other girl (haha im not good with names) and even that red haired kid kinda. 

Weekend: maybe shopping for clothes tomorrow, Lord knows i need some. That or ill be with friends, who knows. Saturday im going to Ellijay iwth Matt. That should be really fun, i havent seen him (outside church) in a long time. Im going to bring my camera. I havent gona apple picking in years and years, and this will probably be my last time in a long time. sunday, church, then morgan is coming over and we need to do our movie for shrooms. DAMN IT!! I NEED TO DO MY PAPER TOO!!! I can just bs it i think. Make it wordy with teh facts and im set. at least i know taht once this is all turned in and done, ill be free for awhile."

Ill probably just be posting various weird things because i have no life, sometimes thigns that have nothign to do with how im feeling, most the time they will though. Probably exagerrated at that. Im just tired, maybe ill write stuff later. I just wanted to test the colors. 

-If the definition for feath is being brain dead, but the heart can keep beating, is the person really alive? If the heart cannot pump, but the brain cna still work for 2-3 minutes, is that person still alive for that time? Where in the body does the soul reside if the brain can live without teh heart for a time and the heart without the brain? Ancient civilizations thought the liver, but that is a mere accessory organ. Perhaps Edison was right about life units of soul in hte body. But that would mean shedding your soul everyday. Perhaps there really is no soul. A man once did an experiment that showed that the soul weighted 3/4ths adn ounce, but if this is true, it must reside somewhere. Sometimes i think the soul may be nothing but the electric impulses in our mind sent by nuerons and neuroglia. However, why would our soul be electric impulses if we seem to have emotions and  such? parts of teh brain? No. Electric impulses....too material. It's curious. I do not want to go into theology in this subject, thinking of it in reason is much more fun. though i admit, my faith knows i have a soul but doesnt question where or how it resides. 

-my career test said i should be a mental health nurse, a nurse practitioner, or a psychologist. I think ill prove it all wrong, or maybe ill settle for teh psychologist. But that seems to easy..."

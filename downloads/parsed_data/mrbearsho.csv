I started doing them on myspace since everyone has myspace and my friends who didn't have lj were bitching about checking here too, so yeah, I am sure that everyone knows this but whatever.


School sucks, but I am almost done, less than 2 weeks, WOAH!!!!

1. When you are sad - I will help you get drunk and plot revenge against
the sorry bastard who made you sad

2. When you are blue - I will try to dislodge whatever is choking you.

3. When you smile - I will know you finally got laid.

4. When you are scared - I will rag on you about it every chance I get.

5. When you are worried - I will tell you horrible stories about how much
worse it could be and to quit whining.

6. When you are confused - I will use little words.

7. When you are sick - Stay the hell away from me until you are well again.
I don't want whatever you have.

This is going to be a really stressfull/busy week for me!!! I have tomorrow off, but I have to be at the civic engagement center in the sub like all freaking day to get service hours in for class so I can pass it, UGH!  Then I get to write a 2 page paper on that (that wont take more than like 10 mins, but is still something I have to do) and then I have a study group at 8pm.  Tuesday I have an easy final at 9am, that the Monday night study group is for.  I work 3pm-7pm Tuesday. Then I have Wednesday off, I have to study my ass off for my stats final so I can hopefully get a B in stats, my gpa needs it soooooo bad!!!!!!!! And then on Thursday morning at 8 fucking am I have my stats final (8am is waaaaaaaaaaay to fucking early for stats) then I work 3pm to 7pm.  And friday I work 3pm-7pm.

Oh and also during this busy week i need to squeeze in time to hang out with my friends and my boyfriend who i wont get to see for 3 weeks! Woe is me, but the money is good!!!!!!!!!!!  So yeah my life is pretty boring, I have been going to bed early and gettin up at 8am since friday adn that will be the latest I get to sleep on pretty much all week except for Wednesday :(  :(  :(  Too much stuff to do sucks!!!!!!

"event","Well this weekend was lots of fun!  I went home Friday morning adn luckily the pass really wasnt that bad.  Friday I didnt do a whole lot, hung out at home and helped parentals with a few little things, I did laundry, which dude, free laundry is bomb!  I am pay $2.50 to do one load, thats washer + dryer, and that is freaking expensive!!  I also made my mom a cake, cause her bday was thursday adn my dad didn't really do anything, and my bro couldnt even call home to say happy birthday... guys are lame. (well at least the ones in my family)  Yeah, so making the cake was a fiasco to say the least, but it all ended well, and I got cake and icecream..... yum!

Saturday was a bit more interesting Allison came over at like 11am, and hung out at my place for a few hours, we helped my dad make cinnamon roles, they turned out hella good!!  It was good to see her again, duh, haha.  Then her and I left my house around 3.  She really wanted me to see the new apt that she is moving into, so we hung out at her place for a bit then her, Dustin, adn I walked down to their new apt, its sooooooo nice looking, I am very envious of their washer and dryer!  After ogling(sp) their place we went back to their place and watched some Sex adn the City, and of course Allison had to practically fall asleep on the futon.... geez! J/k she had been up for almost 24 hrs, so it was understandable. By that time it was almost six, so Dustin drove me home cause I felt obligated to spend lots of time with parentals cause I hadnt seen them in 2 months, and my daddy misses me, and also I dunno the next time I will see them.

I have a job interview at safeway tomorrow at 3, you all have to think good thoughts for me!!!!  If I get this job though I am more than likely going to be here for turkey day and thanksgiving, so if I am you guys have to take pitty on me and send me some mashed potatoes, via mail, real ones only though, fake ones are nasty, hahahahahahaha.  I am hoping that I get this job cause I really need one, unless of course any of you guys really want to pay me for sexual favors during break, hahahahahaaa.  Yeah I know I am crazy!  I am hoping this interview goes really well, I am not nervous, but I rarely get nervous, its nice yet weird at the same time, I guess I just have an abundance of self cofindence, or some crap like that.  

Today was a good day, I had to get up too early, but that is usual at home, I have been pretty tired today, cause I got 18 hrs of sleep over 3 days, and that is not near enough for me!  I was so tired that I fell asleep in the car on friday cause I only had like 4 hrs of sleep, my friend told me at one point he looked over and my head was back and my mouth was wide open...... not hot... oh well at least I am not interested in him, cause that would just suck, and I didnt drool, lol.  Well back to today, I was able to get my mom to take me out and buy me some stuff, YAY! We went to old navy, and I got some really cute cords, very outa character for me cause I used to hate cords, they are really pretty, like a raspberry color. And I got 2 long sleeve tshirts, to where under my tshirts for extra layers cuase it gets hella cold here!!  I got a white one and gray one (yes I had to tell you that!)  Then we went to hot topic cause I wanted a patch for my jeans, they didnt have as many good ones as they usually do, I was disapointed, but I got a greenday one cause I like them, and it was cool looking so I got that, adn then a Harry Potter Goblet of fire shirt caught my eye adn I had to go check them out, adn convinced my mom to get me one, she was gonna save it for Christmas, but when we got home she said I could just take it with me now.  So that was very exciting.

Well I think its time to end this, cause its getting too long.  See you sluts later!"

My team won, it was waaaaaaaaay awesome, my partner was waaaaaay better at it then me though, cause hes like a beer pong vet, but outa 10 cups I think I made 3 of them, and it was down to the last cup, and my partner got it in, and then it was my turn, and if I got it in that meant that they didnt get one more shot to throw it at our cups, and I MADE IT IN, IT WAS SOOOOO FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!!!  So yeah, last night was cool.

And got there and the dr says nothings wrong with me adn thats its prob just alergies.  And I was all uhhh ok, even though it totally isn't because for the last 3 WEEKS I have been coughing, had a runny nose, tons of post nasal drip (YUCK!) and a scratchy throat, that is not alergies thank you very much.  It was practically a complete waste of my time, and she didnt even give me free sudaphed(sp) which they always do so that was sucky.  So yeah I am still stuck with this damn disease or whatever it is till my damn immune system can get off its ass and get rid of it.  Its very lame having an immune deficiency!!!!!!!! :(  Oh well, not much I can do about it.  I got my bike fixed finally! Its had a flat tire for like a week and a half, very lame, cause I couldnt ride it to class, duh! So I got it fixed today, also got some groceries at freddies, so I had a slightly productive day, I still have to do laundry, but right now I am hungry! so I think I am gonna cook dinner! Later!"

I am really glad that its the weekend, it was nice to chill and stuff, spent most of the time inside cause its soooooooo freaking freezing outside!!!!! It feels like November, not October!  Finally turned the heat on in our place, its been off up until like 10 mins ago.  Umm I am gonna eat some leftover potpie soon and then go over to Jasons and watch charmed on his tv while he is over here, cause its the best show ever!!!!!!  Well I've run outa things to say, so, Later sluts!"

"event","Well the current love my life is Jason, because he got my computer hooked up to the internet, damn I have missed it so, lol.  Not a whole ton going on in my life, I mean I guess a lot of stuff has happened since I last updated but none of it was life altering such as, I found Jesus (not gonna happen, btw).  

Being back in eburg is great, I missed all my friends.  My new apt is freaking AWESOME!! I am soo glad I am living off campus, and I love rooming with Monica, we are crazy but we make work, our current thing right now is watching the neighbors casue we are freaks, but they are crazy!! And we named the maintenence guy Juan the gardener, haha we are mean, don't ever get on our bad side cause we will come up with a mean nickname, bwahahaha.  

Last night and tonight were a lot of fun.  I got to go out to the bars both nights with Lindsay, and damn I was HOT!yeah you wish you were there so you could all drool all over my hot ass! ;)  Last night we went to the Starlight which was freaking crowded but you just chill and drink so thats cool (and for the record I drank water only) and then we went to the oakrail, and danced for 2 hrs.  Yes I danced the whole time it was loads of fun, I was surprised I was able to do it sober, and for those of you who saw me on my 21 run, no judging, cause I looked better this time, lol.  The guys there apparently thought I was hot since I got a few wanting to dance with me and one particular one I wanted to jump his bones, but I won't kiss and tell ;) So yeah it was a ton of fun!

Tonight was also fun, we met up with some of Lindsays friends at the Starlight, the boys crack me up, they are so funny and random.  After doing that for awhile we went to the Oakrail (and again I did not drink anything but water) wasnt really in the mood to dance tonight, so I just chatted with some guys, and that was cool, I did however get asked to dance like 4 times.  Saw one of my old profs there, I am like totally in love with him in an a-sexual way if that makes sense, hes to old for me though, like 40's, and if I had been in a dancing mood, I totally woulda had him dance with me cause he is way bomb. 

Well I am hungry so I think its time to make and english muffin and eat it, YUM!

Later sluts!"

If you can't access the site, you have a minor freak out - and a major case of hitting reload.

You found yourself composing journal entries during dates, movies, even sex!

When you're out, you suddenly think of a witty reply to a comment somebody made to you... several days ago.
  
You actually call it LJ and not Livejournal. Check.

You've downloaded some sort of LJ program which has only the purpose of making entries easier to write without going on the site manually.

You consider it a great offense if someone deletes you off their friend's list. 

The first thing you do every day when you go online is check your friends journals - even before checking your email.

You actually paid money for a few extra pictures with a full account when you could actually just alternate pics when you want to for your screen icons.

When your friends ask what's new, you get mad at them because you already wrote it in your LJ and they didn't check it yet.

You have put more time into LJ than all your assignments for the semester.

You have more friends on LJ than in real life.

You've met at laest 50% of your LJ friends. 

You can't seem to call your friends by their real names - only LJ names will do.

You've fallen in love with someone you met on LJ.

You have posted about a party or get together on your LJ... and random strangers showed up.

You are guilty of traveling more than an hour to meet someone with LiveJournal. (Extra points for traveling five hours or more)

You've written a protected entry about one of your LiveJournal friends. (Extra points if they eventually found out about it)

You have written posts to notify people you're going to sleep.

You talk about your LJ friends to your real life friends all the time... like they're a part of your group.

You've created a LJ community, and people actually post in it.

You've been recognized in real live by a fellow LJ'er.

You have friended someone because of their LiveJournal icon.

You have ""pity friends"" on your list, who you would defriend if you could.

You've pimped one of your friends on journal, trying to get people to friend him / her.

Instead of doing research, you post difficult questions on your LiveJournal.

Your pets all have their own LiveJournals.

You know, right now, how many people have friended you (without peeking).

You've stopped being friends with someone in real life because of something they've said on LJ.

You're guilty of posting sexy or nude pictures to get more people to friend you.

You have consoled yourself after a horrible day thinking ""At least this will make a great LJ post""

You're jealous of people who have more friends and / or comments than you.

You have written a really great, solid post - only to be disappointed by the lack of good comments.

You're guilty of commenting excessively to get more traffic to your journal.

You've deleted a post a few minutes (or hours) after you've written it, because it seemed lame in retro spect.

You give shout outs to all your LJ friends on their birthdays.

You have an additional, secret journal that hardly anyone knows about.

You've broken up with someone - or ended a friendship - soley via LiveJournal.

You have gotten mean anonymous comments (bonus points for figuring out who it was via their IP)

You've been reported (or reported someone) to LJ Abuse.

You've been featured on LJ Drama.

You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other friends who are LJ addicts.</font></td></tr></table>

Brought over a ton of my stuff. All I have left to take over is furniture, books, electronics, and the stuff I am using now like my bathroom stuff.  It was nice being back in eburg, good old eburg, I miss it, didn't get to see as many people as I wanted but come Sept 10, I can see all my friends again, yay!  Well time to go do dishes or something like that, I did pretty much jack shit yesterdy so today I told my mom I would vacuum and clean the house for her.  Later sluts!"

But the good news is that we don't have to worry about the van dieing any more, cause on saturday we got a new car, yayayay!  This is very unheard of for my parents, it takes my dad forever, I mean forever to decide anything, and yet we have a new car.  Its a 2005 honda pilot.  this is what it looks like <img src=http://automobiles.honda.com/images/2005/pilot/customize/base_car/GY_exl_34FRONT.jpg>

Its really nice.  Its awesome that we finally have a car that has a stereo thats not fucking retarded, and it has a cd player (very exciting for me, lol) So yeah going to eburg to dump a load of stuff.

"event","Well as everyone knows I was headed off to eburg today.  I got up early and my mom and I packed the car all up with stuff to take to my apt, and we started out ok, but almost to the top of the pass that car started acting up, it wouldnt shift into overdrive, so we were going barely 60 with the pedal to the floor.  So yeah lots of time was spent waiting and hoping it would cool down and be fine, that didnt work, so we ended up having to call a tow truck and get towed all the way back to Oly.  That was waaaaaay lame and expensive!!!!! $439!! OUCH!  so yeah, not the day I intended to have, I was super pumped that I was gonna see eburg and my apt today I didnt get to go :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :(

The only good thing is that this seems to have finally convinced my dad that we need a new car, the van is a totaly piece of shit, the transmission has been rebuilt twice, so hopefully *crosses fingers* we will get rid of it, my parents went up to puyallup(sp) and look at the Toyota dealer and tomrorrow we are going to Fife to the Honda deal. So yeah."

"event","<P>Man I am freaking tired. Stayed up too late last night, again.... Hung out with Sean, Allison, and Dustin till like 5am. At 4am Allison demanded (and by demanded I mean like at gun point) that we go to McDonalds for breakfast. Since all of them other than me were somewhat less than sober Allison asked me to drive her car, while in the same breath saying that if I in anyway whatsoever damaged it, or even had a fleeting thought of damaging it, or even looked at it funny I would be buying her a new car. That was after asking me if I was sober enough to drive.&nbsp; Very humerous as it was 4 am and I had had 2 mikes adn the last one was like at midnight at the latest, so I told her I was trashed, cuase ya know, me and dustin had fun with that one, lol.&nbsp; We made it too and from McDonalds without any injuries, it was weird driving her car cause it was waaaaaaaaay low compared to the van. Had a lot of fun though last night, watched Red vs. Blue for the first time, its funny but I dont think its quite the knee slapper that Allison does, lol. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Oh random sidebar.... <FONT color=#33cc00 size=5>LIKE A HOTDOG DOWN A HALLWAY!</FONT>....&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>so anyway it was alot of fun.&nbsp; This week is gonna be busy for me.&nbsp; I gotta get all my school stuff together, and figure out what I need to get, it will be deff different this year since I am gonna be in an apt, YAY!!!! about freaking time.&nbsp; Soon I get to go down to Centralia with my mom and get pans, yay, lol, yes I DO feel that everyone needed to know that.&nbsp; Some cool news is that I am pretty sure I have convinced my mom to let me take the big brown recliner thats downstairs in addition to the loveseat, yeehaw!&nbsp; That way when you guys come down (over, up, right, WHATEVER) to ellensburg, there will actually be seating for more than one person, which in my oppinion is always a good thing, hahhaha.&nbsp; So yeah moving there will be interesting, I have a lot of stuff, we haven't decided if we are gonna rent a truck thing or make several trips in the van and my dads truck, cause to rent a truck is about $190 before taxes cause of how far away eburg is, thank god its not any farther, hahahaa.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Was talking to Brie about the new theater tonight and telling her what allison told me about some church buying the old one, and we were speculating about what the church is gonna do with it, and we thought it would be funny if several church denominations got it and like one denomination in each screen.&nbsp; And we were joking saying that the mormons and the catholics would be running around and trying to convert everyone, well, anywho it was funny to me.&nbsp; </P>
<P>My story is kinda on hold right now.&nbsp; The creative juices are stopperd up, kinda like blue balls.....but not...... (ahhh, so sad how little things make me laugh so)&nbsp; I have a ton of ideas written down right now, so dont worry they wont get lost or forgotten.&nbsp; And I cant let my story totally die without getting any farther or else brie will beat me up, adn then I would cry adn be sad, hahhaaa.&nbsp; If any of you guys want to be in my story, or some facet of your personality let me know, so far I have Allison, Dustin, Me(of course), Brie, Lindsay, and Jen.&nbsp; (if I forgot anyone, even though i am pretty sure I didnt, let me know)&nbsp; so yeah....</P>
<P>Um, I am tired and&nbsp; I am killing time, and randomly feel like typing and letting all you all in on all the mundane details of my life.&nbsp; Is it sad that I like using multi-syllable, slightly obscure words in conversation? It makes me happy saying things like mundane, or when drunk, pragmatic, hahahhahahaha (again sad that the little things make me laugh so.)&nbsp;&nbsp; I am listening to my bowling for soup cd that dustin was nice and got me, they are deff one of my fav groups.&nbsp; Them adn Maroon 5, does that make me sound lame?&nbsp; I dunno. </P>
<P>Well I think its time&nbsp;to end this cause you guys are all going OMG I AM GONNA KILL YOU IF IT GOES ON ANY MORE, so there its the end!!!!!!</P>

<P>It was unusual weather for August. The rain poured off the gutter occasionally splattering my window. It was dark, surprising for 8pm. The sign on the door said closed, but my partner and I were still in the office, waiting for the mysterious man on the telephone to show up at the preasigned time of 9:30, bringing with him the half million he offered and a job for us. Times were lean so half million up front was like tuna in front of a cat, we couldn't resist, especially since he offered another half mill if we completed the job to his liking.<BR>Who am I you wonder?&nbsp; The sign on the door says it all.&nbsp; M and Spike Private Eyes.&nbsp; Sounds like a glamerous job but it really isn't.&nbsp; Alot of spouses hire us to see if they other spouse is cheating as well as lots of late nights holed up in my '89 piece of shit, buick lesabre, freezing in the winter, boiling in the summer, watching and waiting with cameras poised.<BR>At first glance we don't look like much, to the untrained eye we seem at most a very boring married couple.&nbsp; Spike, looking more like an accountant than anything, was nicknamed thus for his quickness with a vicious 6 inch railroad spike, sharpened to a deadly point and&nbsp; more effective than a switchblade. Equally as nerdy as Spike (however I would not be caught dead wearing a sweater vest) I would fit in very well at a young librarians' conference, minus the scary glasses.&nbsp; Instead I carry an equally scary .357 magnum desert eagle, tucked in the small of my back. I have a tendency to use the gun first and ask questions later</P>
<P>Deep in my thoughts the loud knock at the door took a second to penetrate my brain, I dropped my feet sharply from my desk where they had been resting, causing a loud thud against the battered wood floor.&nbsp; My orange cat Bogart, startled by the noises, ran across the room making Spike cuss as he nearly tripped over the cat in an attempt to open the door. Years of being a detective made me accustumed to weirdness and oddities, but I almost was unable to make my face devoid of expression at the site of our visitor.&nbsp; <BR>He looked about 90, but his voice put him more at 70. His face was terribly disfigured, the left side hardly resembled a face at all, an eyepatch covered where his eye has once been, and the flesh seemed to hang off his face in the areas that weren't ravenged by scar tissue. He was dressd all in black with a cloak around his shoulders, circa 1800's, a bit old fashioned for me, but he was going to pay half mill and it wasn't for me to comment on his wardrobe choice. </P>
<P>He introduced himself as Mr Smith, the name we knew to be fake immediatly, Spike shooting me a look across the room, but we decided to let him tell us his story. What he was about to tell us for the next half hour, would change our lives forever, but we were too reckless and poor to care.<BR></P>"

It was unusual weather for August. The rain poured off the gutter occasionally splattering my window. It was dark, surprising for 8pm. The sign on the door said closed, but my partner and I were still in the office, waiting for the mysterious man on the telephone to show up at the preasigned time of 9:30, bringing with him the half million he offered and a job for us. Times were lean so half million up front was like tuna in front of a cat, we couldn't resist, especially since he offered another half mill if we completed the job to his liking.

Who am I you wonder?  The sign on the door says it all.  M and Spike Private Eyes.  Sounds like a glamerous job but it really isn't.  Alot of spouses hire us to see if the other spouse is cheating as well as lots of late nights holed up in my '89 piece of shit, honda, freezing in the winter, boiling in the summer, watching and waiting with cameras poised.

At first glance we don't look like much, which is part of the secret to our success, people don't think we are detectives and open up to us much easier.  Spike, looking more like an accountan than anything, was nicknamed thus for his quickness with a vicious 6 inch railroad spike, sharpened to a deadly point and  more effective then a switchblade.  Now you are probably curious as to what I look like, well think older college kid. Carrying instead of books my trusty .357 magnum desert eagle, tucked in the small of my back with silencer of course, a weapon that I have a tendency to use first and ask questions later.

Deep in my thoughts the loud knock at the door took a second to penetrate my brain, I dropped my feet sharply from my desk where they had been resting, causing a loud thud against the battered wood floor.  My orange cat Bogart, startled by the noises, ran across the room making Spike cuss as he nearly tripped over the cat in an attempt to open the door. Years of being a detective made me accustumed to weirdness and oddities, but I almost was unable to make my face devoid of expression at the site of our visitor.  He looked about 70, but his voice put him more at 50. His face was terribly disfigured, the left side hardly resembled a face at all, an eyepatch covered where his eye has once been, and the flesh seemed to hang off his face in the areas that weren't ravenged by scar tissue. He was dressd all in black with a cloak around his shoulders, circa 1800's, a bit old fashioned for me, but he was going to pay half mill and it wasn't for me to comment on his wardrobe choice. 

He introduced himself as Mr Smith, the name we knew to be fake immediatly, Spike shooting me a look across the room, but we decided to let him tell us his story. What he was about to tell us for the next half hour, would change our lives forever, but we were too reckless and poor to care.
""My name is Mr. Smith.  For now all dealings will be through me, but you may eventually meet my boss Blondie.  She is a force  to be reckoned with so any thought of betrayl or double crossing should instantly be erassed from your minds.  However that is not the issue here, your reputation of being honest proceeds you, and if I had any doubt in you I would not be here now.  I am now going to tell you why I am here.  My story centers around an exquisite diamond, as most stories do.  This isn't just any diamond, it is the worlds largest diamond, it has spent so little time in public that almost  no one has heard of it.  Originally named the Elizabethan Diamond, after the Queen who owned it, it is now know as the Blood diamond because of all the blood that has been shed in efforts to get it. Rumor has it that if you hold it outside under the light of the full moon the cursed (for it is believed to be cursed) diamond shines a brilliant red, the red of all that bloodshed. This of course is a rumor and I myself do not believe it.  
This diamond is what I want you to get for me.  It was, legally, owned by my boss Blondie, and it dissapeared 10 years ago.  At the time we searched fruitlessly for it to no avail, but about a month ago rumor has it that the diamond is back in the area.""
""Wait,"" said Spike ""Isn't that stupid of them to bring the diamond back to the area?""
""It is, but we believe that due to much double crossing the diamond has passed through several owners in the last 10 years, and Letworth is a city known for its huge jewelry black market, so it has drawn the theives back here, not knowing that it came from here originally.""

"event","I am about to write a quick short story.  I dedicate it to dustin, because if he and I hadn't been discusing falling into toilets via aim, the idea for this story would have never come to me.

This story is supposed to be like the film noirs from the '30s, think Humphrey Bogart (if you dont know who that is, something is wrong with you and you better this instant go out and rent Casablanca!!!!)

Times were lean so half million up front was like tuna in front of a cat, we couldn't resist, especially since he offered another half mill if we completed it to his likely.

Who am I you wonder?  Some criminal about to pull a heist?  Just the opposite in fact, my partner and I are detectives.  Sounds glamerous, but its not.  I am M and my partner is Spike, nicknamed that for his quickness with a vicious 6 inch railroad spike, sharpened to a deadly point and more effective then a switchblade.  This talent has come in handy several times when he has saved my ass.  Although Spike has saved my ass on occasion, I have a reputaion for shooting first and asking questions later with my favorite .357 magnum desert eagle with silencer, of course.  

There was aloud knock on the door interupting my thoughts and making me tilt my chair forward and thump my feet on the floor.  My orange cat Bogart ran across the room startled by these noises, making Spike cuss as he almost tripped over the cat in an attempt to open the door.  If years of being a detective hadn't made my face impassive to strangness my mouth would have dropped at the sight of our visitor.  He looked about 70, but his voice put him more at 50.

"event","Well lately I have felt not at all any interest in doing a real lj update (yeah i know the wording of that sentence is odd).  

My bday was good.  Jen was way cool and picked me up for my bday.  We met up with Jeff, Nikki, and Shane at a bar called Frankies.  that was lots of fun!!! As you all theoretically saw in a previous lj update comment, i drank a lot (well at least for me) it left me very drunk!  I think we left at like 1 something, and Jen was cool and drove me to top so I could say hi to allison.  that was amusing to say the least, I was very apparantly drunk, I think it was very entertaining to allison, even (or especially) when I like fell on the floor right in front of her, lol.  Luckily we had perfect timing she got to go on break right after we got there, so we got to chat and she helped jen walk me to the car, be the bathering idiot that I am even sober, I kept saying that i was drunk, but yet very practical and pragmatic, and then went on to ask what pragmatic meant, yeah yeah I know I am retarded.  After that jen drove me home, my family was gone so that was nice, I stumbled in the door, walked down the stairs and proceded to fall on my ass on them, I was damn lucky I didnt fall down the stairs lol.  I searched for my cell phone charger, that was interesting, finally found it, and plugged cell phone in, that was a must since I was leaving for 3 days the next day.  

Managed to get into pjs and take contacts out, adn grab a bottle of water adn put it by my bed.  And then cause I felt like I might puke I sat on the floor by the toilet.  Ended up falling asleep with my head on the toilet, I have no freaking idea how long I was out for, coulda been 20 mins, coulda been 3 hrs, woke up and stumbled to bed.

Allison called and woke me up at like 7am and said she was coming over, so I stumbled my ass upstairs unlocked the door adn went back to bed, she came over about 8ish and we both proceded to try sleep, me cuase hell I was tired and didnt get much sleep the night before and her cuase she just got off work.  

My hangover proceded to hit me at about 8:30am, ew!  That is when the puking started, it was gross, I proceded to puke 6 times between 8:30 and noon, sleeping in between when I could till 11 when i got up to take a shower, that was hard, it between deciding to shower, showering, getting contacts in and combing out hair it took an hr, most of that was me sitting on the couch groaning adn thinking that I really need to get my ass in gear and put in contacts.  

The timing of my hangover(monday, in case anyone was confused) was shitty!! Because Allison, Brie and I, had plans to leave Monday for a 3 day camping trip for my bday.  and we had a lot of shit to get together Monday, especially me since I hadnt done any packing.  

I am deffinitly indebted to Allison and Brie, brie for not hating me as she had to get alot of the food stuff together, without me, and Allison cause she was nice while I was puking, got the puke bucket for me, and even packed my stuff while I sat in bed groaning that I wanted to die.  

We finally got all the stuff together, much later than anticipated, mostly due to my very comatose state.  Left town at like 4pm, adn I had anticipated leaving at noon, hahaha, then again I hadnt anticipated on being hungover.

Went to ocean shores for camping.  that was a lot of fun.  we had a sweet campsite, not to close to people or the bathroom, but not so far that I had to walk a mile to pee.

One of the most fun parts of the trip was riding mopeds, none of us had done if before so we decided to give it a shot, omg it is sooooooooooooooooo much fun.  we ended up riding for 3 hrs, 2 hrs straight on Tuesday and then an hr on Wed.  So yeah that was waaaaaaaaaaay bomb!!!!

One last thing and then I am done.  Because of my hangover i am on a no alcohol kick, it just makes my stomach go ewwww thinking about it, it will be interesting to see how long this lasts, I know it wont be forever.  

But now its time for me to go to bed, I am tired, I worked my ass off all day painting the side of the house, and I havent gotten much sleep the last few days. later sluts!"

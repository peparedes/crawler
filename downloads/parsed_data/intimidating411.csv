"event","I just got off the phonw with my mother.  It was the first time I had spoken to her since january 2nd cause that how much of a bitch she is.  I tried to talk to her about a fight that i had with my boyfriend yesterday.  Somehow I thought that by letting her in my life in such an intimate way that maybe we could both forget the past for a night and at least get along about how men suck!  This happens the same way every time.  She's a drunk so we usually get into some big falling out when shes drunk and violent and I leave cause i dont want to deal with this shit and I'm tired of being her mother.  Then we don't talk for a while and I claim that I don't want anything to do with her for a while.(the time amount varies)  Eventually we get into a few arguments here and there all started by her.  (this time all of those existed on AIM) and then I'm stupid so I feel bad about telling her the truth about herself when we are fighting and eventually I allow myself to get wrapped up in it all over again.  I keep thinking that the next time she won't suck so much.  She won't insult everyone in the world that I care about.  She won't call me a selfish bitch.  However, as I said before, it always happens the same way! Why am I so stupid I would really like to know.  Her excuse for being mad at me this time is that I started talking to my father.  (I just met him in october)  He seems like a nice guy but for some reason she is mad anyway.  God forbid I should have someone parental figure n my life that is not a raging alcoholic who screams every chance that they get and curse at the people they supposedly care about.  Basically she is a horrible person and I truly am furious with myself for getting involved again.  I just can't seem to get it through my head!  Chimps learn faster than that!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","I really can not take people that whine to other people that you give them attitude and don't like them anymore when 1) you never gave that person an attitude and 2) people should know that if i have a problem with you you generally know it cause i TELL YOU!   If these certain people are so worried about me liking them they should grow some balls and ask me cause whining to others about it will make me NOT LIKE YOU.  If you want that go ahead and bitch away about how im soooooo mean and you will get what you want.  All I ask is for people see things the way that they are and to not exaggerate situations as if me not saying hi to you every second is the end of your fucking world.  Stop Whining about everything and maybe you will get things done.  WAAAAAAAH POOR ME I can't say anything to anyone's face ever! WAAAAAAAAAAH!"

"event","I am really getting sick of people being rude to me and treating me like shit 24 hours a day for no god damn reason.  It really hurts my feeling when the people that are supposed to care about me treat me like i mean nothing to them.  To all you people out there who do this and you know who you are; seriously fuck off.  I don't need this shit from you or anybody, you are selfish and cruel for no reason and honestly what is your point in life?  My day didnt end until half an hour ago and yet when I finally get the chance to just chill I have to deal with shit from you!  People need to learn how to follow the Golden Rule but no one seems to follow it but me.  Maybe I'm the only one doing the right thing or maybe I'm the only one doing the wrong thing! Maybe I should treat people that I care about like shit for no reason!  Maybe that way I will get some respect!"

"event","well today I proved to myself that even if you are the bigger person you can still get kicked in the ass.  The annoying/crazy girl Lauren called my friend Amanda a whore last weekend.  I defended her but now Amanda has asked for a mediation meeting between Lauren and herself.  I of course had to set this up.  Now this girl is planning on trying to get me fired.  I don't know what the hell her problem is, and I know she won't succeed but seriously what a BITCH.  I've gotten into arguments with her basically because i think shes a terrible person but truthfully I've never done anything to her.  I am so sick of weak little blond girls who feel the need to fuck with everyone else because it makes their worthless little lives seem better."

"event","thank god i opened this today i was pretty hyper and happy all day today but then all of a sudden i got really pissed off.  I think it could possibly be due to the fact that my residents are so loud and i feel like they dont respect my authority ( by the way I'm an RA).  I ususally dont like to say anything becuase i want everyone to like me but for the first time i did.  And some girl that doesnt even live on my floor or my building gave me a huge attitude.  I then realized that she was harassing a girl on my floor.  Not only do I not appreciate her attitude but now I had to protect this resident.  I feel like I did a good job. I made the girls leave the building and i've decided to not be so easy anymore cause i dont like being taken advantage of and it need to stop but its ok ill get my shit together eventually."

"event","So, yesterday this overly dramatic girl lied in her AIM profile about something stupid.  My friend Manner told JT and JT inquired to this girl (mary) she then proceeded to freak out about how my friend was immature and childish then she puts in her profile that me and my friend are overweight so i told her she should judge people on their appearances and insult them because of it just because she is not intelligent enough to think of something better.  Then my friend Tony bitched her out for insulting me and she said ""what are you on the Laura fan bus?"" which i think is the funniest thing i've heard all year actually.  I think everyone should be on the Laura fan bus if they know whats good for them that is.  I'm not a fun enemy.  Just ask Tara (my personal lex luther).  But I'm actually not even annoyed my mary's stupid comments I think shes pathetic and that she sucks at life but the stuff that comes out of her mouth is hysterical and I needed some entertainment today."

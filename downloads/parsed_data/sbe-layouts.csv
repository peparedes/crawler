none up soon, but i already have several stored up for when i get around to posting them.

feel free to leave a comment with any layout requests. yes, i do custom jobs. i'm afraid i do have limitations, however. i don't like working with entry scrollboxes AT ALL. i would probably have to really like your idea in order to go for it. they're pretty much just a pain in my ass. but i do pretty much everything else.

once again, all the layout posted here are made by me, so any of the styles you see done here, i am capable of doing it."

"event","i haven't updated this thing for real in a long time. so much has gone on... i dunno where to start!!! .... lets see... me brad danny n amica have gotten really close. like... 2 or 3 weekends ago we all headed up to the lake with torrin... that was  blast. i'm in love with 4-wheeling. :-) then it rained so we went home. cept i was ""spending the night at bri's house"" so i couldn't go home. brad let me stay at his house. that was fun... hrm... then that weekend i went to brenton's house *cuz i think that was halloween weekend*. he had a keggar...but i didn't drink. asshole was there... drunk as fuck. but after that brad danny n amica and i all went to amanda's sisters party. that was alright. kinda boring though becuase everyone was a lot older. and we weren't drinking... but i didn't have to be home by curfew that night so i went over to brads for a while...and i got a text from asshole apologizing for not hangin out with me that night, and that we would have to hang out soon.  the next night i dont' even frickin remember what i did... lol...we'll just skip to that week...we didn't have school for veterns day so we all hung out... we went and saw the grudge that movie is fucking scary!! lol then i kept teasin brad about gettin some ass, and he told danny he felt bad cuz he thought he was leadin me on... he wasn't though... i was just bein crazy. i spent the night at amicas house that night which was fun cuz when we left brads house we went to pick up her step mom at like... 4 in the morning. then we ended up going to dennys until like 5am.... then we went home and passe dout for like... 2 hours then amica had to go to basketball so i went home... then i interviewed for a job which i still haven't heard back from... hrm... last friday night we all went over to brandons party, that was interesting. but i ended feeling like an idiot.... because i was under the impression that asshole wanted to fuck around, then the cops came...so we all had to leave. i told my dad i was spendin the night at amicas house but ended up sleepin at brads. but the asshole totaly blew me off so on saturday i asked him what his intentions were... and he never replied. i'm not hurt or anything...i just feel stupid. ... i really gotta talk to him though...cuz i'm the manager of the guys basketball team and he plays basketball...so in order for things to not be weird i gotta get somethin figured out... but on saturday we all hung out at brads again...then amica spent the night at my house... and i guess that brings us to now. my parents are thinking about moving out to 255th ave...out in whitman... holy hell..thats a fucking long ass drive to go to school everyday... but it'll be nice. somethin like 2 acres with a 300,000 square foot house. i'm excited. on top of that though i'm realy stressed...not having aj ob.... grades... family i dunno..... things are just crazy right now. i need to settle down and figure life out...but i gotta get back up to the school right now. i have some shit i gotta take care of...

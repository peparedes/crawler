"event","The world is a bright place, and things are always changing, but some things never change. There's a beginning, a middle, and an end to everything. Love, hate, inspiration, pride, and awe. They're all just mere human reflections in an entire universe. Substanceless, but nothing seems to have more substance. Novas, stars, planets, moons. All so distant, so useless. What can I do with them? It's nice to know that there's something else there, but it's also nice to know that it doesn't matter, because how will those things have an effect on us? We're put on this earth to live, whether by a God or mere accident. We evolved not to be stronger than other things but for survival. Thousands of years of change, all so we can feel one simple blaze of glory. Humankind is amazing, if not for creating all the things we have, but also for having shortcomings and recognizing them. For all the wars fought and all the lives lost, there is also an outcry of righteous rage toward them. Songs are sung, battles are fought, people love, loves end, but we are living. One might ask why... but that would be vain. We don't need to know why, we only need to know that we ought to."

A sweet green leaf is the catalyst to change the worn, dead land into a stream of trickling water, sliding down upon the grey and brown globe. The globe with the burns and the decaying buildings... as the water slides onto that globes all is turned to green, all is returned to the great origin of all.

"event","Bohemia Bohemia. So many people debate what it is, whether it is the land of the gypsies, or the dreamland of the ""Children of the Revolution"" of Moulin Rouge it represents freedom and individuality. 
Bohemia for me is whatever makes me feel empowered emotionally and makes me want to see justice done. 

Bohemia is something that many people feel will never come, some far off and distant land that is the shadow of happiness. These people then become apathetic and are rendered useless because of this feeling. This should never happen. I used to hold no emotion for those who were apathetic, but now I do. Only one emotion that they return to me because they think I'm naive and childish. This emotion is pity. In my mind I am better off than these people, because though they may be free of hurt and sadness, they are also free of fire and passion and love and life. A bonfire burns in the depths of my soul, there is only the remnants of a candle wick in theirs. Begging to be lit. These people are begging to be loved. And begging to be themselves."

"event","Stupidity and ignorance are two different things. 

Stupidity is inflicted upon one. An extreme example of stupidity are the Parishioners of the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka Kansas. They have allowed themselves to be influenced by a man with the cunning of Adolf Hitler who would cause death if it went to the benefit of his ""cause."" This persecution of gays and Jews stems from their allowing themselves to be taken advantage of. There is no excuse for stupidity, because of all the information available in the world today.

Ignorance is self-inflicted. A less extreme example is President George W. Bush. His persecution of gays is based off of not knowing what the Hell he's talking about. He's in a privileged position and yet he knows nothing of the pain GLBTQ people have to go through. Again as with stupidity, there is no excuse for ignorance because of the information available that contradicts anti-gay views (not to mention obvious philosophical reasons).

But both ignorance and stupidity stem from the same origin, absence of thought. Thought is a process where one makes one's own decision about something, whether it is of imminent worry or of no import. Thought weighs all the evidence available, and the decision made is based on fact."

The day there is nothing left to defend.

I was a fool to believe life will go right,
Instead fell to the pleasures of the night.

All the imagery of death I do not believe,
And all the darkest things I have concieved.

The hurt strikes at me to the core,
Am I but a Seer and nothing more?

Amazing it is that I feel,
Everything considered real.
When in my reality,
I have no need, no love to see.

When will they realize that life is nothing more,
Than an insidious reflection of time's speckled whore.

The world consumed with material things,
No life that rings with innocent deeds.

Today is the day when dreams do end.
I was indeed a fool to believe at all,
For this is the day when all will fall,
The pleasures are the only thing to defend.

Come to me, the darkness now,
Imagery concealed in how.

The mothers brought forth paradigms.

Guarding against the mist and the dark,
Foreboding the ""evil"" and the stark.

Our dreams we do defend as ours,
As we experience them for hours upon hours.
They are looked on as petty things,
Much like so many magical kings.

And now while dreams are quelched,
The paradigms do rule.

Punishments are dealt,
to those who try to fool.

Reality is the very last line,
And the space to fanstasy is very fine."

Reality is in my opinion, the most depressing thing that exists. Although there is little else that does exist. So where does that leave me.... depressed? Well a lot of the time yes, but another half of my time is spent imagining if things were different from the way they are. It does distract me from current events, and on some I don't even have opinions. Which to some might point to me being apathetic. But it is far from that. I just don't hold with the norm. I'm not content to know the same mundane facts as every other human being. Therefore I believe things that others would not dare to, and I want to know things that others do not think of."

"event","I remember how it all was. Our lives were our current dreams. We always wish we could go back to how it was. Just for a flickering moment I can see the light on the beautiful shapes of the past. Whether it's yesterday or a decade, the good old days hold a mystical allure. Childhood, our teens, we want to love it, we want to relive it. We can't make do with what we have. When it's terrible tomorrow, we always look back on horrible today, and wonder why we can't see it again. Because what has already happened is always better than that which has not yet occurred. 

In my belief, this way of thinking is flawed. Look toward the future, new experiences are waiting. New faces, new dreams, new lives, and new realities. They're all waiting for us, we can turn forward and look. Because living is a little like walking backwards, you never know what's behind you, and it's almost impossible to peek back."

The warmth fades as all feeling, quite coolly disappearing from the blankets and the covers.

And the hearts are far, far away, orbs of red, blue, and purple, against a dark black sky.

Concepts appearing and disappearing, none helping, and the day goes on with people dying, and wars being waged.

And yet through all heartbreak and betrayal, some find warmth, by those meager orbs on the black horizon.

So maybe the orbs warmth will be fed with the inspiration of those by them, so that emotion will be spread to all, and compassion will become the rule.

Or maybe the small orbs will fade, those finding warmth will freeze, and apathy will greatly inspire the already frozen landscape."

Superficial people, druggies, romantics, and realists have all got it wrong. What you look like doesn't really matter. When the high of drugs wears off your problems are still there. When the nostalgia of ""love"" is gone, reality is back, and love is the least of your worries. And when you realize that things are the way they are, it doesn't help you, because you don't believe there's anything you can do about it. Instead people should just try to have a good time, without costing anyone else any fun. I always try to look on the brighter side of reality.

Things had progressed far past my progression. Vampires were given the vote, werewolves were now real. And my concepts of freedom for all were considered enslaving.

All was new. The cars flew. Dreams were orderable. And mail-order brides really fell in love.

And the times I remembered. The walking in the hot days of summers. The laughing faces of my beautiful friends. Those memories were concealed from me, as all seemed to be plastic. The only beautiful face I could see was behind a gas mask, hiding from pollution in this new ""free"" world.

What can I say? I've been anchored to the past? My freedom is your doom?

I want to walk in open fields and hug and kiss under the moon. But in YOUR reality, we would hug and kiss in a fallout shelter and walk on a high tech treadmill.

Freedom calls me. Your enslavement is a great divide in my freedom. I wish you could just see the way it is. The enslavement is too much, you win, you take away the golden light of my soul."

"event","""Darkness,"" first published in 1816
by Lord Byron

'I had a dream, which was not all a dream. 
The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars 
Did wander darkling in the eternal space, 
Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth 
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; 
Morn came and went--and came, and brought no day, 
And men forgot their passions in the dread 
Of this their desolation; and all hearts 
Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light: 
And they did live by watchfires--and the thrones, 
The palaces of crowned kings--the huts, 
The habitations of all things which dwell, 
Were burnt for beacons; cities were consum'd, 
And men were gather'd round their blazing homes 
To look once more into each other's face; 
Happy were those who dwelt within the eye 
Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch: 
A fearful hope was all the world contain'd; 
Forests were set on fire--but hour by hour 
They fell and faded--and the crackling trunks 
Extinguish'd with a crash--and all was black. 
The brows of men by the despairing light 
Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits 
The flashes fell upon them; some lay down 
And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest 
Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smil'd; 
And others hurried to and fro, and fed 
Their funeral piles with fuel, and look'd up 
With mad disquietude on the dull sky, 
The pall of a past world; and then again 
With curses cast them down upon the dust,  And gnash'd their teeth and howl'd: the wild birds shriek'd 
And, terrified, did flutter on the ground, 
And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes 
Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawl'd 
And twin'd themselves among the multitude, 
Hissing, but stingless--they were slain for food. 
And War, which for a moment was no more, 
Did glut himself again: a meal was bought 
With blood, and each sate sullenly apart 
Gorging himself in gloom: no love was left; 
All earth was but one thought--and that was death 
Immediate and inglorious; and the pang 
Of famine fed upon all entrails--men 
Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh; 
The meagre by the meagre were devour'd, 
Even dogs assail'd their masters, all save one, 
And he was faithful to a corse, and kept 
The birds and beasts and famish'd men at bay, 
Till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead 
Lur'd their lank jaws; himself sought out no food, 
But with a piteous and perpetual moan, 
And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand 
Which answer'd not with a caress--he died. 
The crowd was famish'd by degrees; but two 
Of an enormous city did survive, 
And they were enemies: they met beside 
The dying embers of an altar-place 
Where had been heap'd a mass of holy things 
For an unholy usage; they rak'd up, 
And shivering scrap'd with their cold skeleton hands 
The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath 
Blew for a little life, and made a flame 
Which was a mockery; then they lifted up 
Each other's aspects--saw, and shriek'd, and died-- 
Even of their mutual hideousness they died, 
Unknowing who he was upon whose brow 
Famine had written Fiend. The world was void, 
The populous and the powerful was a lump, 
Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless-- 
A lump of death--a chaos of hard clay. 
The rivers, lakes and ocean all stood still, 
And nothing stirr'd within their silent depths; 
Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea, 
And their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropp'd 
They slept on the abyss without a surge-- 
The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave, 
The moon, their mistress, had expir'd before; 
The winds were wither'd in the stagnant air, 
And the clouds perish'd; Darkness had no need 
Of aid from them--She was the Universe.'-Byron"

I've recieved notification that I'm annoyed right now. The notification was from me... but thats okay. 

I'm exhausted, because I went on the drama trip and we saw three shows. First ""De La Guarda"" a fantastic, if not bizarre, work of art. It was great. No way to describe it, an abstract wonder. Reminded me of a creation story in some parts. See it. I saw ""Movin' Out"" which is a show that someone based on a few songs from Billy Joel's music, it was okay. A bit long and drawn out, with no lines or songs from the actors. But the band that played all the songs was fantastic, it takes a lot of stamina to play for 2 hours. See it if you like long drawn-out musicals inspired by Billy Joel. Finally I saw ""Thoroughly Modern Millie,"" a very traditional but well written musical about a country girl who moves to New York in the '20's. See it.

I'm a vegitarian now, I'm just sick of hearing about dying animals in slaughter houses. 

By the way, give your friends the web address to my journal, I'm tired of going without comments.

My Poem of the Day:

Dream, my loves, of soft paper satin.
Of riches and absinthian art.

Think, my sweets, of flowing latin.
Of my dreams, I won't even start.

Hear, my dears, of warm killer's mind's.
Of death in the streets, of the swarming of signs.

Feel, my hearts, of the spider's dark meadow.
Get caught in the web, a dirty stark ghetto.

And come to my aide in the wanderer's land,
Dig deep down, and live in black sand."

Yea I always have to open that way, and I know no one reads this but... thats okay. 
   
So anyways, have you ever been confused? I know thats a futile question, everyone's been confused. I'm extremely confused about the drama trip tomorrow, not for any real reason. But I mean... it's confusing somehow.
   
I'm discovering that I can actually write on an everyday basis now, and not just when I'm in ""the mood."" (Any sexual references will be forced to be forgiven.) It's good to know because I feel like I'm accomplishing something, which I rarely do... how rare.

I'm putting spaces between my paragraphs today.. don't ask why, I'm just in the mood to put spaces between them.

Okies, I'm going to leave now. I know I didn't write much.. but I don't really feel all that talkative today. So I'll leave with a short creation or two.

My Poem of the Day:

The mists of the river, float over the dawn.
The feelings of shiver, will not last long.

My heart is misplaced somehow,
Awaiting your call.

There wasn't a doubt 'til now,
I was in free fall.

Become my lover in the tide of the waking light,
Silence your affections in the path of the night.

Peace and Decadence,
Robin A.K.A. CutThroatJr"

Today has been a pretty much shitty day. Not because anything especially bad happened, just because nothing good or new happened and such things. I'm not going to rave on about annoying inconclusive things that depress me, because that would just bore you. 

My friend Johnna, some of her friends, and myself, will be, in maybe 298,751,908,723,590,123,485,715 years, working in a funeral home that will be bright purple with black trim. (I know thats a fucked up sentence, go to Hell!) It'll have a nightclub, a motel, a giftshop, a vintage clothing store, and the actual funeral parlour itself. Our uniforms will be black and white pinstriped shirts, pants, vests, and jackets. All employees may live on site and will be required to dye their hair black. Conventional funeral homes beware!

I still don't understand the livejournals. It's odd how something so simple can be annoyingly confusing. Computers in general bug the fuck out of me, I mean I love them but I hate them. Currently I must use the public computers at my town's library because the phones lines that run the dial-up modems are down and I'm too poor to afford DSL or other conventional systems. Go Marxism!

I'm supposed to be going to a trip to NYC with my school's Drama Club, but I'm hopelessly confused about what to do... oh well. I'm also going on a band trip to NYC next month. I've never been to New York, but now I'll have been there twice in one year, sweeeeeeeeet.

My Poem Of the Day:

    ""The Only Lesson in Time""

Run me away from the dawn of time.
Get me gone the monotony of grime.

The filth of the centuries fits my mold.
The screen of the time is ready to unfold.

So beware my children, of lusty thoughts.
And beware of dashing thy enemie's children on the rocks.

*INHALES*

Aaaaaand, nothing changed.  Same problems, different people.  I like someone, someone doesn't like me, or at least I think they don't.  They COULD, but, honestly, who the hell knows?  I sure don't.  I try to find out if things might be happening, but no one knows anything.  Apparently, Nick has already hinted in this direction to this person, but who knows if it was taken seriously.  She did make plans with me this weekend, but then again, she did invite a lot of other people, so really,  nothing is proved from this equation.

"event","This have been interesting needless to say.  School's out for summer, but I'm sure most you know this by now!  A lot has happened in the last month it seems.  I took the ACTs.  That was fun.  Still don't know what it was I got on it though.  Kinda freakin' me out.  But anyway.  There's a new girl in my eye currently.  Christina.  Boy oh boy do I like her.  But this being the situation.  She seems to really like Matt.  So, I'm kinda just here.  Don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm mad at Matt or anything.  Matt's a great guy, and I'm glad that he's happy.  But it just sucks for me...Oh well, that's life.  As usual..."

Amanda is again, back with Matt.  That's what sucks.  But we're going out to the movies tonight, so yeah, thats cool.  Ah hell, I don't even know evenmore.  I just don't even know why the fuck I even bother anymore.  Yeah, I like being her friend and all but it's just weird.  She's probably reading this, (Hi Amanda) so yeah. Anyway, I'm leaving for now, see you all(no one) later."

I'm talking with Janelle(Jake's girlfriend who set this whole thing up).  I find out that Alison doesn't think we're gunna work out.  Quick check, if you didn't see that coming raise your hand...nope, no one, alright then.  Anyway, she doesn't think we have a lot in common.  I feel worse than anything ever before.  She's gunna talk to her though.  Hopefully tell her what I'm really like.  I just really hope this works out.  She is so great.  I just...I don't know.  I just want to die."

"event","Its been an interesting day.  I found out that Cari isn't freaked out because she thinks im gunna ask her out, she freaked out because she has to go to court today.  Now, before you start thinking weird stuff, its because her mom turned her in for illegally driving.  And it was on little, side roads and in the woods and stuff, not like she was indangering anyone!  Its really dumb.  She's pretty worried about it.  But anyway, we talked in homeroom some and its better now.  I just still gotta work on getting her to see that Matt is a complete asshole and to stop even intereacting with him."

"event","Things take a turn for the weird.  Ok, last night, I was talking to Cari, she had to go, yeah yeah, then I noticed she changes her name to ""If you ask, I'll say yes"" then logs off.  This totally raised one of my eyebrows.  I asked Jake (my friend) what her name ment.  He says he cant tell me, its a secret.  I'm sure you already know what Im thinking.  So, I say I'm thinking what it is and I'm gunna act on it tomorrow.  He thinks I'm serious, I'm not.  Then, today, he tells her and she says ""No!  Please dont let him!""  Because she doesn't want to hurt my feelings by turning me down.  Anyway, I yell at Jake for doing so, then in homeroom, me and Cari have it together.  Well, it was interesting.  I try talking to her, but its not the same.  Ok, let me step back a second.  On last Thursday, school was cancelled.  Well, during the day, she gets online and says ""hey you wanna do something?"" so I go up to her house, we hang out all day, I dont get back home till about 9.  It was a really great day because I just love spending time with her.  Also, while I was there, I was invited to come over the next day to go to her birthday party.   Her family-only birthday party.  I was amazed that I was invited.  Her parents really seem to like me, which is cool.  I'm the only boy that they actually trust to be with her.  Because they know I won't do anything(which I wouldn't).  Anyway, she also wanted me to go with her to her mom's.  See, her and her mom haven't been on very good terms latley, and she doesn't feel comfortable going alone.  So, she asks if I'll go along with.  So, I do.  Anyway, Sunday, I get a call from her.  She needs to go back over to her moms and she wants me to go with.  So again, I do.  She also has invited me to go to camp with her for an entire weekend.  Of course I gladly accept. Over that weekend, I realized that I must spend the rest of my life with this girl.  She is so perfect in every way.  I honestly can say that I love her.  So so so so so so soooooooooooooooooo much!  She is the funniest, smartest, funnest to be around, most beautiful person that I have ever known in my entire life.  I don't want anyone else ever.  I just want her.  Yet no matter what I do,  I can't tell her.  I'm just to afraid.  And already knowing she would never say no to me doesn't help matters any.  Oh the pain...."

"event","but no one reads this anyway, so what does that matter?  Well, let me cover what has happened since I last updated.  Amanda is still with Matt, and nothings gunna happen there anyway.  Cari is STILL obssesd with Matt(diffrent Matt).  He is the biggest womanizer I've ever seen but she just can't seem to help herself.  She says she's in love with him.  I can almost guarentee that they are doing something right now just because he can get her to do anything he wants.  AHHHHHH!! I hate this.  The feelings I have for her are so great...and I can't say anything to her...it hurts so much.  Just know that he's forcing her to have sex with him or something.  I swear, I will kill him.  And no I'm not just saying that.  I will."

"event","We'll, in order for you to really understand what is going on today, let me go back a couple days.  

First off, there are a couple girls I like, Cari and Amanda.  I have liked Cari for quite awhile and I thought she was finally starting to like me back, and Amanda has been trying to help me out.  At this time, I didn't like Amanda, we were just friends.  After Amanda was talking to Cari, she began to hang around me more often, we talked more, she began calling me, and we made plans to go out and stuff.  Thats why I thought she might like me.  But then Nate comes along.  Now, he's already said he liked Cari, but he already had a girlfriend.  However, they broke up.  And thats when I realized Cari just isn't ever going to happen, so I just gave up.  Then I began to think about it and realized that Cari wasn't the right girl for me.  The one that was was right under my nose.  Amanda.  She just got dumped by her boyfriend(Who is a complete asshole).  She was having a really terrible week and I was comforting her.  She seemed to be getting better.  Then, on Thursday, we were talking, and she said ""Hey, you wanna do something Saturday?"".  Of course I was happy.  Then, at the basketball game on Friday, Matt(Amanda's ex) showed up.  They were talking.  I just kinda left when no one was looking.  I looked back and saw that Matt was sitting behind her and she was resting on him, and he had his arms around her.  And now I have nothing.  No where to go.  Nothing at all.  I don't even care anymore.  I just hope I end up dieing.  Soon."

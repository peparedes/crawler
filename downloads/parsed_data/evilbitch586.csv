"event","I never knew exaclty how hard it is to say good bye, until now.  I have so much to say but i can't find the right words to say it.  Today, the strangest thing happened.  I was taking the social studies regents and all i could think about was how i was never going to be in a room again with all these people.  I looked at everyone long and hard, and soaked in every curve, edge and swivel on their faces so i wouldn't forget them.  Maybe later on their face will give me strength if i ever need it.  Some of the people i've known since 4th grade, while others i've only known for a few weeks.  Some of them are my best friends, while others i don't even like.  But as i looked at all the faces i remembered memories i had with them.  I was able to find at least one moment of laughter shared with each one of them. I know I'm going to move on and make new friends.  I want to say I'm never going to forget the old ones, but in reality people move on and they do forget, but I'll try my hardest not to."

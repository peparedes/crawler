It was the most boring, horrible class that I have&nbsp;ever taken. Whoever invented the CS150 requirement should be shot especially in this high tech computer world that we live in. Who doesn't know the things that are taught in that class? Honestly, and if you are not in a CS major or minor who needs it anyway? Three hours of nonsense that does not matter twice a week is quite enough thank you very much...<br />I am still taking MTH 123. Trig I can handle. I don't absolutely hate that class with a passion, only the fact that it is longer and I have to go to class until August 7th. :(&nbsp;The project is coming along-ish and I should be able to figure out what's what this weekend.&nbsp;<br /><br />This 4th of July was amazing! I worked all day and it was dead so that was pretty poopie but after work was great. Jenni cooked me dinner because she is cool like that. We had BBQ chicken which I haven't had in a long time! Josh came over so I had to cook him something since he can't eat BBQ sauce... that is too sad for him. We ent to Dorr for the fireworks and we walked around by the park and stuff to kill time. My sister was there&nbsp;in all of her drunken glory... It was sad, but she is making her own poor decisions in life and it's not something I can control right? I got an elephant ear! It was soooo good. I didn't share at all and Josh was sad but I asked him if he wanted some and he declined, so how is it my fault? We hung out at the church for a little while and got some food (after the elephant ear of course!!) Pastor Krenz introduced himself to me again... it was pretty funny since I introduced myself to him before... twice, but I understand it is going to be hard for him to remember everyone right away since he is very new. I like him though so that is good. He will help the church continue to heal. The fireworks were amazing and they were better because I got to share them with Josh :)<br /><br />This summer is not turning out how I expected. I hoped that something would keep me sane this summer because work alone was certainly going to kill me. I am very thankful for the way that it has turned out. I didn't know I could be this happy. I am amazed and at the same time&nbsp;scared that it is all a dream. I never thought I was allowed to be happy and now that I am.... It could all be taken away... I shouldn't dwell on it because whatever happens, happens and I am thankful for that.</font></font></p>"

"event","So my birthday is tomorrow!! I'm very excited to be 20... Yeah what a shitty age... too old for kids stuff and not yet of legal drinking age... So instead of having a big, loud, fun, drunk party at a drinking establishment my really awesome, great friends threw me a party yesterday!! It was a lot of fun and I wish you all were there to share in my special day... The important ones at least... It's no matter, those that were there made it a great night!
Heather got me a plant for my birthday!! How kick-ass is that? She doesn't even like plants but she risked her good name and bought me one all the same!
Classes started Monday and I fell asleep in my CS150 class both nights... MTH 123 is really hard to follow sometimes but the prof is a crack-pot... He swore about twelve times in a row today... I think with a little probing he would have thrown his calculator at the wall... maybe next week.
The transition from on-campus dweller to commuter went better than I thought it would. I really like my apartment! My roommate isn't half bad either :) I'm saving so much money by taking lunches to work and to school. I'm amazed... so far the only thing I bought this week were groceries and gas... AMAZING! Okay, I bought a new CD too... so sue me... 


I'm tired of pretending everything is fine every minute. Nothing is perfect and I don't want to imagine it is anymore. Life is hard enough when everything is good... things keep going wrong and I just want to sit here and forget your face... exist without pain, hurt, loneliness, rejection..."

"event","and she updates... 
My mom is depressed and is currently on medical leave from work. I visited her last weekend and she was so bad to the point that she wouldn't leave the house without one of her kids with her. She is on medication that is hopefully going to help her. I drove her into Wayland to pick up Megan and she kept telling me how to drive and saying ""I'm just trying to help"". It made me really sad to see her that way. I'm not sure that I can do anything to help her because I do not do good with sick people at all. I just kind of sit there and act real quiet or just ignore the fact that they are sick. I visited again yesterday and before I got there I saw a sign that said ""Pansies on Sale!"". Pansies are my mom's favorite flower so I stopped and bought her a flat of them thinking they might cheer her up a little. I also think that she couldn't possibly leave them to die so she'd have to go outside and plant them... thus getting her out of the house... devious I know... :) It really pisses me off that she continues to drink while she is on those meds though. anti-depressants and alcohol (a depressant) do not mix. She must just not care. You would think that after all the BS she has gone through that she would see that drinking is not the answer. I see it but then again I also see so much more than she does when it comes to life. She is holed up in her make believe world where everything is great when you are drinking and smoking pot and getting your 17 year old daughter drunk right there with you.... *sigh*
Yeah, so Megan dropped out of school. I had a bad feeling that it was going to happen. Every time I went to visit or met then somewhere to hang out all she talked about is drinking and having sex with a guy... A different guy each time... I just hoped that she was smarter than that, but again I knew that it wasn't true. She is under the delusion that drinking and drugs and sex are the most important things ever and screw an education. It's not like school is going to take you anywhere... just out of the hell hole that you have been raised in... oh but that's not everybody's goal...
I guess Maddi isn't doing that great either.. I've heard some bad stuff about her that I don't think I even wanted to hear. She is 7 years old tomorrow and has already had to deal with so much shit that it doesn't seem fair to her or anyone raised in that situation... myself and Megan and Cory included... *Sigh* 
I had dinner with my dad today. He got all pissy when I called him and let him know I was at Applebee's. I guess he didn't hear me say Standale 12 times... whatever, that I can handle. So we were eating and just talking about nothing in particular when all of a sudden we are on the subject of child support... my least favorite subject to discuss with my dad because he believes that all women have kids just to get child support from ""innocent"" males. Anyway, he went on about how he supported my mom's whole family with the $20 a week that he had to pay... blah blah blah... (I hear it every damn time and every time I just want to stab my self in the brain) I finally mentioned to him that he DID support our family, sorta, with the money he gave each week during a period of time back when things were at their most horrible... or the beginning of horrible depending on who's telling the story... (abridged version: my childhood was pretty damn shitty) anyway, I told him that and he was like, ""I don't doubt it."" I just tried to make him understand that he really did help and the bitching was getting him nowhere because I was not going to see eye-to-eye with him since I very much appreciated the money that we got so we could eat another week, even if it was ramon noodles ::shudder:: <--- cannot eat that shit still- He went on to ask if my mom was an alcoholic and I said yes, it's not a secret or anything... and I just continued on about that horrible summer when we were so poor that we didn't have electricity or gas, ie: COLD SHOWERS and NO TV... (haha, I was young, I thought the world was ending when we didn't have tv). I hate that my dad can't understand other people's views, he is so stuck that he is right and everyone else is wrong... well to that I say BLAH! *sigh*
Okay, sorry to just dump that all in here... I'm sure that it's not very entertaining to anyone... not me either for that matter, but that is the shit that I am thinking about and sometimes it's just better for me to write it down.

"event","I should really be working on my economics homework that is due in a few hours but this seems like more fun... What is better than typing away meaninglessly? I enjoy it so that is what matters right?

Lately I've been on a roller coaster... classes are great one day and horrible the next... relationships are the same way.... and work, blessed, horrible work... I don't know if it's just that the semester is winding down or if I've totally lost motivation for everything except sleeping, but shit is hard! I can't seem to do anything right and remembering everything is becoming increasingly difficult. Just when I think I've got everything under control.... the pieces drop and I'm left alone to pick everything up and rearrange it so I can carry my burden once more. 

Don't get me wrong.. everything isn't totally horrible. I am getting a new(er) car, one that starts and has a radio and four WORKING doors! This is most exciting. Also, I am getting transferred to the wall-coverings department at work.... no more GD cashiering! 

I went to Chicago yesterday and it was a completely great experience! I <3 that city! I could live there. Katie and I got stopped by a guy that was selling ""Save the Children"" memberships(?) He kept touching me on the arm. I wanted to ""touch"" him in the face! We had to walk down a different street three times to avoid them after that. I find that a little excessive. I think if he wouldn't have been so annoying I might have paid attention to his spiel and might have considered offering up some cash... maybe... I am still a poor college kid after all. We went to the Art Museum and to the Symphony on the Honors College's dime. I enjoyed the cultural enrichment quite a bit. We went to Ed Debevich's and to the Rock-and-Roll McDonald's for gellato (more culture!!), the good bread place for a scone and some peach iced tea... We did a ton of window shopping and I did have to buy a sweater since I was unprepared for the horrible cold that was the weather... Stupid weather channel anyway.

I want it to be sunny outside. I have had an overpowering urge to sit in the grass and watch the sky. Leaves and grass are taking over my dreams... I cannot contain my wish for spring any longer! Arrive sweet spring so that the winter gloom is cast away and I might be able to forget about homework for a good reason... like sleeping in the sun! (it was.... almost poetic... lol)

Hmmm... this has been an exciting update brought to you by:

"event","I cannot say that I thought,before I left, that my spring break was going to be really awesome and exciting but it turns out that it was despite my pessimistic view! I'm so glad that I went to Chicago. It was one of the most important, enlightening trips ever. I really enjoyed the whole experience.

Sunday We drove through snow and other great weather to get there. We ended up taking a bit of a detour because Dave (man in charge) gave us some faulty directions. Finally we made it to Chicago! We went out to eat at a Puerto Rican restaurant first thing and the food was really great! Some people thought that it wasn't authentic since most people got quesidillas and burritos which you can get here too. I had a.... can't remember but not one of those.... it was good, most importantly!
We went back to the church and got some instructions for the week and then we went on a scavenger hunt around the neighborhood (it was night, in Chicago... yeah I was worried we were all going to get lost to never be found again) then we met at I-Hop and had some dessert. It was late and we were tired so we went to bed next :)
Monday we met Dulce (she cooked for us all week and is amazing!) and we packed up offices for the Pastor and his wife. I had a Migraine so I ended up passing out on the couch that day :( 
Tuesday we carried boxes full of heavy books up three flights of stairs. (not fun but helpful none the less) Jenni was sick all day :( We went back to the church and loaded more boxes. The guys were on a mission to carry a 600lb copier down two flights of stairs but they couldn't get it separated so it was forgotten for now. We went to Coldstone since we were all doing an amazing job so far :P There were mice all over the church. A lot of the people on the trip did not appreciate them at all. Amanda's parents wanted her to leave at once and everyone talked about a Hotel. I picked up a sick one with some magazines and took him outside to die (It was sad). All week mice kept showing up and no one got happier about it. I think it added to the experience. Also, out of four showers.... only one had hot water. 12 people, one hot shower... you do the math...
Wednesday was our free day. We got up earlier then expected because there was a little confusion over breakfast (pancakes!!) We took the L into Downtown Chicago and everyone split up. Jenni, Jac, Amanda, and I went to the Lego store!!! It Rocked! We walked around and went shopping and had lunch at the Webber Grill place. Good food. (I ""borrowed"" another restaurant container) We met up with Jon and walked around some more. We went to the Rock and Roll McDonald's which was pretty fricken awesome! There was a man there (Sean??) and we talked to him for a while about our mission trip and he told us to pray for his grandmother. It was very interesting to meet a stranger and have him be so open and interested in our group. I guess that most people, whether they believe in God or not, have that reaction when they find out that you are on a mission trip. We went to Gino's for dinner... Chicago style pizza is great stuff. I wrote my name on the wall there!!! It was a blast and then it rained haha... We went to the sports store on the corner by Gino's to get out of the rain and we sat downstairs and talked for a bit. Jac bought a hat and I didn't even though I wanted to. Jon took us a few blocks in the wrong direction and we ended up back on the Magnificent Mile where everything but Virgin Records was closed... guess where we went! A man tried to sell us all a paper (The Onion- it had some weird news let me tell you) for $2.00... and then we didn't have any money so he took them all back... That man could walk fast... It was a bit creepy.... We wanted to go to Jimmy John's but it too was closed so we went to McDonald's instead. I had a Shamrock shake!!! YAY! Then we took the L back to our cars. We got back and we watched That 70's Show for a while then we all slept. There was a mouse scare during the night but I choose to ignore them since I didn't want to get up....
Thursday we went to Trinity College somewhere outside Chicago. That is one small school. The dorms are really nice though. I do not think I could ever go there though. There are more people in Hopkins then there were at that school.... WOW! We went to Pastor Peter's and loaded up a ton of books and then went to the church for the copy machine. He took it apart and the guys did a fantastic job getting it down the stairs. I couldn't believe how heavy that thing mush have been.... We got everything unloaded and everyone rested for a minute. We played sardines at the church and I hid in a trash bag! My leg felt like it was going to fall off from me leaning on it for so long... but it's still intact and I think it was an ingenious move to hid in that trash bag still :) More That 70's show and then bed. We were rudely awoken by a mouse at about 4 am. He was trying to eat the chex-mix and I finally got pissed and moved all the stuff so the little shit couldn't eat it anymore. The next morning I was told that he was crawling around by people... He was just asking to be killed.
Friday we packed up the nurseries and loaded those boxes. We did some other little stuff and then we went on a prayer walk. I'd never been on one before but it was interesting to see the property that The GAP wanted to obtain. Pastor John explained their vision for the property and what they hope to accomplish in the Community. I hope their wishes and prayers come true because they really are trying to help the community in a great way. I'll have to go back someday to see. We went to an Arabic community and visited a few shops. We tried this cookie thing, good but different... very different. Jenni and Jac got this ice cream thing and that was awesome. Their banana chips are salty... but good.
We went to a welcome center in the Arabic community and I learned some interesting stuff.... I'm not sure if I agree with that man but he's more knowledgeable then I am I suppose...
We went out to dinner with Jose to The Starlight Cafe. Talk about authentic Puerto Rican food! It was great to try different things all week and this was no exception. Jose told us his story and it amazes me still what God can do in people's lives. 
Saturday was a day for goodbyes and it was a little sad to leave. I got to know everyone so well and I learned so much. I think that we did a lot for the people at the GAP but I think they did something for us as well. Everyone there was so nice and giving even though they didn't have a lot. They were so thankful that we could help even when we all thought we did so little. It was amazing."

I was thinking that I could make a random appearance this weekend, but I know that it was futile since I have to work late on Saturday... I thought it was next week (I only work until 6 next Saturday) but it's not so I can't. :( I don't know I had this sudden urge to go home either... I don't like home as a rule and I just saw my mom last week... Eh... who cares?
I guess I could try for next week but that seems stupid since I leave for Chicago on Sunday and I'll spend only three hours at home... So I guess I won't be going home in the near future... ::shrug::

I went downtown yesterday to get some tutoring <b>ASS</b>istance to no avail... It was a big damn waste of my time since the tutor didn't know wtf he was talking about... and I quote ""I haven't taken this stuff in three years..."" SO WHY THE HELL ARE YOU ADVERTISING THAT YOU CAN TUTOR IT?!!! Obviously there is a little hostility remaining... :) Next time I'll just drink gasoline, it's better economically for my car anyway.

I bought <i>RENT</i> yesterday and it is probably the most hardcore thing ever! I could seriously watch it everyday for a week and still want to watch it again! I'm cool like that anyway :P

I made plans with my mom to get lunch today and I drove out to Wyoming to fulfill said plans to find her already on lunch!! I was ticked. I just talked to her last night to remind her and she still forgot... BULLSHIT! The worst part was she had a breakfast burrito from <b>""The Wheel of Death""</b> instead of hanging out with me :( I'm not as good as a diseased burrito.... LOL!

I got B's on everything I freaked out about last week... not so great but way better than I thought I was going to do.... Holocaust disappointed me since I studied my butt off... oh well... try harder next time.

I made some really great plans this week and had to cancel them all because I forgot about other, more important stuff. I must really be turning into my mother or something. I do not know what happened to my memory. My planner isn't enough it seems.

I am getting excited for Spring Break! I really think this mission trip is going to be good for me. Even though I do not know anyone going on it except Jenni, I still think it will be fun? Interesting? Enlightening? 

Habitat for Humanity is doing a lot of stuff this semester and I am very excited for that. I really want to be a part of an organization that does something. Next semester I am going to be way more involved because I want to be... maybe join some cool clubs... thinking about a sorority... who knows... We will see.

I had eggs and gravy for breakfast today. It was good.

I looked up a few poems that I forgot about. I don't like poetry as a rule but there are a few exceptions that I will allow. It makes me snicker a bit since these were poems we read in 10th grade... But it matters not. They are still good. Even weirder in my mind is that they are by the same author? poet? whatever?

<lj-cut text=""The Lake Isle of Innisfree"">
THE LAKE ISLE OF INNISFREE
By William Butler Yeats
I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree, 
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made; 
Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honeybee, 
And live alone in the bee-loud glade. 
And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow, 
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings; 
There midnight's all a-glimmer, and noon a purple glow, 
And evening full of the linnet's wings. 

I will arise and go now, for always night and day 
I hear the water lapping with low sounds by the shore; 
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements gray, 
I hear it in the deep heart's core
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""The Stolen Child"">
The Stolen Child
By William Butler Yeats
Where dips the rocky highland 
Of Sleuth Wood in the lake,
There lies a leafy island 
Where flapping herons wake 
The drowsy water-rats;
There we've hid our faery vats,
Full of berries 
And of the reddest stolen cherries.
Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild 
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.

Where the wave of moonlight glosses 
The dim grey sands with light,
Far off by furthest Rosses 
We foot it all the night,
Weaving olden dances,
Mingling hands and mingling glances 
Till the moon has taken flight;
To and fro we leap 
And chase the frothy bubbles,
While the world is full of troubles 
And is anxious in its sleep.
Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild 
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.

Where the wandering water gushes 
From the hills above Glen-Car,
In pools among the rushes 
That scarce could bathe a star,
We seek for slumbering trout 
And whispering in their ears 
Give them unquiet dreams;
Leaning softly out 
From ferns that drop their tears 
Over the young streams 
Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild 
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.

Away with us he's going,
The solemn eyed:
He'll hear no more the lowing 
Of the calves on the warm hillside 
Or the kettle on the hob 
Sing peace into his breast,
Or see the brown mice bob 
Round and round the oatmeal-chest.
For he comes, the human child!
To the waters and the wild 
With a faery, hand in hand,
From a world more full of weeping than he can understand.

Bowling for Soup is at Ferris tonight and Heather and I are road-trippin' up there to see them! Oh and more excitingly... Megan won two free tickets so I get to go <b>FREE</b>!!!!! Hanging out with Meg, Jer, Jenni, and Heather will probably be really awesome. I cannot wait, although, it is not as bad as waiting for Relient K. I'm less familiar with Bowling for Soup but a concert is a concert and a free concert is WAY better!
Tomorrow I do not have to work!! I took the entire weekend off for a little recuperation from work. It was better this weekend but on Monday I was like a zombie walking around, doing whatever I was told, not talking, lifeless... could be from my cold, could be from my lack of sleep, could be my headache or it could be that I lost the will to work that day. I'm not sure if I really like going to my job anymore. Before I thoroughly enjoyed working but now all I want to do is tell whining, bitchy ass people to <b>""shut the hell up and die""</b> (Everyone is a whining, bitchy ass person btw). Not good... not healthy.
So anyway, tomorrow I get out of class at noon and I'm going to get my check and pay my credit card bill (joy) then come back and be productive for a bit. Later when Heather gets out of class we are going to watch the six hour mini series of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE finally! I'm excited.
Saturday: My mom has the weekend off and originally I was going to take the sisters to Sibs and Kids weekend at GV but my mom is pretty cheap and didn't want to pay $40 for them to visit. Instead she wants to pay way more to take us all out to dinner and a movie. Maddi really wanted to come to GV but it might not happen in the near future unless I can convince my mom to make a side trip here on Saturday for Maddi (I probably can finagle it since it is Maddi we are talking about and she is the spoiled, youngest) All in all, saturday should be pretty fun.
Sunday: Going to Res Life with Heather again. Last week we went and I enjoyed it. It's a lot like I imagined. Far different from my church but not in a bad way at all. I love praise and worship songs!! I think that is why Res Life calls to me. The sermon was 25 minutes long! It was informative and made me evaluate myself so it did it's job... only wish it did it faster :) After church, I'm going to do some homework and whatnot. Lindsey and I might hang out too. No plans yet but I'm sure we can think of something. 
Monday: class then 4 and a half hours of work. I am irate... ::sigh::

That's it I have nothing more...
Tina

Oh yeah and last weekend I got an Ipod!"

"event","Went to On the Border last night with my friends from work. It was extremely fabulous! Before we walked in the door there was a small gathering of people and we thought that they were the wait to get in... turns out two of them were cops and one was a drunk and disorderly customer or something... needless to say he had a <b>fishing pole</b> and he swore and the cop told him to stop... (just giving you the background)
So we ate and checked out the waiters and made fun of our waiter, (Norm) he spilled queso all over our table and onto Jessie's food :) I thought it was rather funny that Jessie was actually mad. So we are about to leave, after taking a few mints (read 12) and we walk outside and Heather says, jokingly, ""I hope that guy isn't here."" We walk another few feet in silence and all of a sudden I scream! Everyone looks at me and I say that I saw the guy with the fishing pole! Jessie drops Jocara's food and spills rice all over and Heather just stares at me like WTF... and Jocara, bless her, just stands there since she knows I'm pretty random... as they all do.... but they still believed me, sorta.

Alright now that that story is recorded in history... I really should change this journal to ""Tina's life... a high school collection"" :) SERIOUSLY"

"event","It's finally Wednesday! The excitement has been never ending, and yet I still have to suffer until 6:00. I know that it's only exciting to me and that no one else on this earth will even understand but you may be curious as to why I am so excited... ECONOMICS kids!!!! I finally have an economics class after almost a whole year without. I know, it depresses me to think of what my life would have been like this last year had I had an econ class sooner... It would have been better, much better, of this I am sure.

On an entirely different note... I have a bunch of shit to do. I'm not even talking about homework or other school BS. I am just talking about the random shit that I should have done sooner... like LAUNDRY! Holy shit I have a lot of laundry... I think that I'd be naked except I got a few articles for Christmas and therefore have a few extra outfits. Laundry is going to get done, really... I just have no idea when. 
The gas guzzling POS needs an oil change, and I thought seriously about just forgetting about it as punishment but I figured the only person I'll be punishing is myself since in all likelihood the car will fall apart or something... I bet that will happen anyway :) 
The biggest news is I am going to get a HAIRCUT! I know, I think it's a bad idea too but if I get hair in my mouth one more time I will wage war and chop it off myself! (never going to happen, I can't even draw a straight line) Probably tomorrow.
I'm going to buy more clothes, jeans in particular. It's the new me... haha. Buy a few t-shirts and what not. It will be great. I like new clothes, a lot.

My classes are going great. I have some really interesting subjects and some really boring shit too. I have a pretty good idea that I will do shitty in statistics but I'll go get help if need be. The prof talks too loud and gives me a headache... I wondered if she was deaf but then I just ignored her. Bad form!
I really like my two honors classes. Katie is probably saving my life by being with me in Molecules and she's going to be comic relief in Holocaust :)

oh yeah... I suppose I should write down this day as a day in history or something. My own benefit mostly... Cory is going back to prison. He is a dumb ass. I am pissed at him. He needs to grow up. Age is not equal to maturity. Disappointed beyond measure... :(

I figure that was a boring post about nothing. I'm sorry I wasted your time and my own for that matter.

My break has been really great. I have done nothing stressful nor remotely productive... I cleaned the apartment and what not but that's stuff that had to be done.... also, I go to work but again, shit that I need to do to survive. 

I went to Yesterdog today for the first time in a long time! It was awesome just like I remembered! Also, I bought books today and they were $200 less than I though so today was a great day! :) 

I'm about ready for classes to start again... as much as I appreciate breaks, I like the feeling of doing something with my time... being productive and all that... after all I am a sophomore now (In about six weeks I'll read this and cry a little because by then I'll have papers and exams and all the shit that goes with classes but for now I am excited about the new semester!)."

"event","Plenty of stuff to talk about but nothing that will interest anyone, besides the people I was with at the time... but that isn't really the point of a journal is it, so I digress...

Hung out with my mom on Thursday and it wasn't too bad really. I got to hear a lot of shit about my brother that I didn't really want to know. He messed up and it is his fault if he has to finish his sentence in prison. He knew the rules when he got out and if he wants to be a dumbass and fuck himself over that is his business. What a selfish dick, blaming everyone but himself.
Hung out with Heather on Friday and went to Ruby Tuesdays. I called myself and left a voicemail and it was pretty sweet. We went to see <i>Just Friends</i>... the movie had it's high points and I laughed a lot and got shushed a lot by Heather. I have a loud laugh... so what? 
Hung out with my mom and Maddi on Saturday since Heather cancled on me. Meany head that she is! We went to the movies and Olive Garden... good times! I saw Mindy and Zachary and the other kids too. It was okay, they are loud and obnoxious and Maddi cried the whole time... can you say annoying? I thought so.  I was about to commit murder and then everyone went to bed so I went to my aunt's house because I have a bed there to sleep in and what not (and it's not five degrees there). They were having a Christmas party and it was a great time... Jello shots are my friend!! I had about twelve and then I stopped since jello is wiggly and stuff! I ate a few chocolate thingys and then played ""Catch Phrase"" with everyone that was way drunk!! Talk about a freaking blast.
Went to my dad's Christmas party on Sunday after church. I despise that party. It was boring and gay and I wish I would have not told my dad about my canceled plans until today (Monday). :) I realize that is evil but if you were around my family you would understand... Really! 
Haha... this is a horrible journal entry. I am sorry for making you think I am interesting. I think I will not update for a while just so you all can shake this horrible monstrosity off :)

I do not say this as a way to get attention nor do I want a response about how ""great"" I am. I just observed the most magnificent thing. I do not know how words can describe it or if mere words are enough.
I saw the chamber orchestra perform tonight for a bit and it makes me even happier to say how much I appreciate GVSU. I would never have listened to Mozart at Baker. I cannot believe how lucky I am to be here. :)

<b>hey tina. i've been meaning to not tell you how much i hate you, because i'm a better person than that. but nonetheless, my hatred towards your putrid soul still lingers. and i ask myself, what ability do i posess to sauvegarde myself from such a pathetic life-eater of a person?...i continue to ask myself that very question every morning when i look in the mirror, but no answer has come from the other side. what life am i living? to live in constant denial day and night whelst you prance around me like a demon in my dream? but it is not a dream at all! far worse, it is reality!

Memory, where are you?
Does anyone know how to install memory to a computer, when it gets here of course? They said they would send a manual but I laughed at the man when he said it was going to be easy... He obviously has not met me!
I will give you money :) well call if you are interested or if you just want to laugh at me!

"event","I should start here... So Wednesday night I was walking back to my room after watching Fight Club (by the way, so it looks less bad, Wednesday was the day of first snow) and I fell into a pothole and ended up face down in the road at night in the dark... well GVSU's campus isn't that dark at least where I fell. Anyway, I don't know how long I laid there but when I tried to get up my ankle hurt like a bitch... didn't think about it much until it swelled up alot and bruised better than anything I've seen in a while. I figured it would go away so I didn't go to the med-center that night. I went to class and work before finally giving in and guess what.... I sprained it! I knew you were all surprised :) I am supposed to be on crutches but fuck that! I have a split thingy so yeah. It's healing I think or it just hurts less. Everyone at work thinks it is the funniest thing in the world. Ahh, yes laugh at my misfortune and pain :) I realize now that it is pretty funny since it was the stupidest thing I've done in quite a while well and the most inconvenient too. Oh well :) 
And if that wasn't enough I woke up this morning sounding like a sick frog. I went to work and people kept asking me to repeat myself and stuff. It was great. I just love when you work with people and they cannot understand you and that is basically your entire job. Again, oh well. 
OOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! I am so pumped! I randomly looked at the paper the other day and saw an ad for a G & L in Allendale! I totally went there last night too! It was great. Just like old times only I'm not at shithole Baker anymore :) and Megan wasn't there :( haha... true story.... The girl at the register asked me if how everything was and I told her that my fries were cold (because they were) but everything else was great and she gave me this dirty look and I wanted to tell her off but I was so happy to eat at G & L that I didn't even care. but next time I'd like hot fries and the right kind of hotdogs... I don't think I'm asking much and it's not like I was a bitch and didn't tip my waitress or anything. I just answered her question.
It is sunday and it is time for Tina to do her normal Sunday homework... ie spanish and chemistry, oh joy !

I bet everyone is so happy for that... ha, no one even cares but that is fine with me! :) I am in a better mood than I have been in for three weeks and it is all thanks to me finally seeing how stupid I was and fixing it! I cannot believe that I would be as dumb as I was but that doesn't matter now since I fixed it and it is over. No scars, no mental anguish, no feelings what-so-ever! :) GREAT!
I looked at my planner today and got a scary wake up call.... Exams are in less than a month and I am not even close to being ready for that stress. I think I need a nap just to forget about it ;) I better get my ass in gear! LOL it's nice to say but will never happen. 
I have to go get schedule help tomorrow downtown. All I can say is they better help me this time and not just toss me in GD classes like the summer. I actually want to graduate within the next 4 years thank you very much. THAT IS WHAT YOU GET PAID TO DO RIGHT? :) I guess I will find out tomorrow if they are going to be helpful or not. I am not afraid to complain until I get the help I deserve and need... (I admit I need help, all sorts!)

I do not know what I am doing anymore. I do not want it to be like this. I want other things, better things! Why can't I have what I want? Why can't people see what I want? I do not want to settle, I do not want to pretend. I just want to be happy, is that too much to ask?

"event","It might interest everyone to know that my life is rather boring. I find myself being less and less productive and my caring level slowly declines as well. I cannot even believe the amount of shit that I am putting off. I should be doing any number of things and yet here I sit... Ha! *wow it's going to storm* I just want everyone to know that I am sorry that my posts are really dumb and useless.... sorry

I did three loads of laundry today and I must say that I am rather proud of the fact that I went so long without clothes... It does get cold in the mornings but it's the price to pay to be broke and lazy! I only scare some people when I walk around nakie anyway... ha or if I really did everyone would run away and gorge out their eyes but then I would have an advantage over everyone being the only person that could see... hmmmm wonder if it is worth it?

I went to Adobe today with Heather and Jeff! It was great! Great food and great company, what more can you ask? Well, perhaps if it were free or as Heather pointed out maybe if just condiments were free.... really I do wonder what the profit margin of 18 cent hot sauce is or 95 cent guacamole... For shame Adobe, for shame!  

As with every Tuesday I feel rather accomplished. I cleaned my room and rearranged a bit. It looks cleaner and yet I didn't really do anything extraordinary... Oh well I'm not complaining! It is sick how motivated I am to clean my room and how NoT motivated I am to do serious studying or any homework... I am sick.

I decorated my door today. It was great really. Got me out of 45 minutes of studying for my two exams tomorrow :) I am rather proud of my decorating efforts. Let's just say that there are Smarties on my door... enough said I think ;) 

I seriously have to get some film developed! I found a random camera in my desk and I have no idea what the pictures are of... well I have a good idea that they are pictures of the moon or the trees or the field but I won't really know until I get the pictures developed! *wow, look at all that lightning and hear that thunder* I want to get them developed but last time I wanted to develop 4 rolls of film it was about $40... or maybe that was just because it was in Ohio? Whoa... that was a long time ago! Maybe I developed film sometime after that but my memory forgot :)

I also spent a good 15 minutes drawing stars on random parts of my body with my blue highlighter. It was distracting enough to be entertaining! I rather like the stars on my foot... Hmmmm... tattoo possibilities?

I <3 the word slinky!
xoxo Tina

*I think I am a loser for being scared of the storm but seriously I am thinking about closing my blinds here. At the same time it is soooo beautiful? I think that is the most confusing thing of all, to be scared and be in awe at the same time*"

On a brighter note I did accomplish many other things today. My car is clean! That is no small feat if I do say so myself. It was about ass deep in trash... I kid you not. But now I am no longer ashamed to call my car a hole but I am a slob! I also found the concert tickets so all in all cleaning my car was a great thing to do! I am happy with my accomplishment. Also, my room is all ""spic and span"" now. I took the trash out and all that fun stuff. I am finally using the extra closet in my room for a pantry.

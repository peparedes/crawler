"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""The ocean opens up to swallow you."">One thing I love about myself: (haha one of many) my ability to change my point of view from gloomy to crazy happy. The first part of this week I was all blahhh (as I have been for awhile) and the second half of this week I've just been like eh, whatever. Maybe it's the fact that I don't have to work today. Or maybe it's the fact that tomorrow I get to see Eric for the first time in...like 13 days. I talked to him a couple times on the phone while I was on vacation...but it just isnt the same.&nbsp;<br /><br />Man...my mom sat in a bean bag chair we have...which is like a bunch of beans in a jean cover...a big blob. And she tried to get out of it and kept falling and I felt bad but at the same time I was so tired I started laughing sooo hard. I was crying I was laughing so hard. Didn't help my sister started laughing and when she laughs she screeches which makes me laugh harder. We went through a true laughing period like that over vacation...that wednesday we drove down. We got lost like 3 times on our way down lol. I need to laugh more often. But gosh that was hilarious. Watching the dog try to get out of the other one was pretty funny too. lol.<br /><br />I bought Eric something while I was down at Williamsburg Va. I'm such a good girlfriend.&nbsp;<br />I was kind of pissed though...There was a little War and Native American store. I wanted to go to it. But of course we drive right by it and go to the Trading Post store my sister wanted to go to. She wanted to go to the one across the road too...so we went to that one the next night. As we left and drove by the one I wanted to go to my mom asked me if I really wanted to go to it because it doesnt look open or anything. I was just like yeah, forget it...GAH. We did what everyone else in my family wanted to do. I had one store I wanted to go to, and I wanted to ride at least one rollercoaster. That's all. But no. Owell. Whatever, it's done and over with.&nbsp;<br /><br />I love this new Linkin Park cd. The fourth song is my favorite.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was totally going to write like one paragraph and got distracted.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm glad that I have a job. Considering if I didn't have a job...I'd have like no one to hang out with. The 'possee' I was friends with in high school has officially drifted apart. Other people have been like 'oh we should hang out' and then they never get ahold of me and I never know if people really mean it because i've been used so much. I keep meaning to get together with Peg but I haven't had the time. There's a week before I have to go back to MU..the week before the 18th. That'll be my only time I wont be doing homework or work. So hopefully then I'll be able to. Then I'm so excited to go back to mansfield b/c it's going to be an awsome semester. But at the same time I don't feel like putting up with the people. I make friends and then when I get busy doing stuff they ditch me and forget about me. When we do get together i ask them how things have been but no one bothers asking me how I've been.&nbsp;<br /><br />Eh. Whatever.&nbsp;<br />I need to stop venting in here because quite honestly I should be venting in the other livejournal I have. The one that only like two people know about.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ok. Back to homework. And lunch. And a shower. then more homework.&nbsp;<br />&lt;3<br /></div>"

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Blah."">I've been in a rut all summer...with a few good moments here and there. I knew I needed a vacation and thought that my vacation from this past Wednesday through Sunday would be just what I needed. Only...here I am, back in the swing of things and I'm back to wanting to curl up under my blankets and never come out. I've had so little sleep and so much stress that I'm getting heart flutters again. I woke up feeling sick this morning and with a horrendous headache monday morning. I'm sore all over. And so overwhelmed.&nbsp;<br />I'm considering dropping this class...but I'll get some form of penalty for dropping it if I do. I got an A- in the other summer class I took. I have four weeks to read two books and do a 3 page paper on each, a film review...which I'm working on right now, two analysis papers after watching two games (5-7 pages long each) and reading a book on the style i have to write it in, and like 8 questions found in another book I havent read all of yet. All in four weeks. Less than that considering this week is half way over with.&nbsp;<br />4th of July tomorrow. And I'll be at home doing homework, cleaning my room, and probably crying. I cry when I'm frustrated and overwhelmed. I've completely lost control.&nbsp;<br />Friday night we might eat at that place across from Dunkin Donuts then go to a movie. Saturday morning I'm going to pick up Eric from work and we're going to do something...not sure yet. I know I shouldn't give up a day with all this work but I need to...he keeps me sane. He's about the only thing that keeps me sane anymore.&nbsp;<br /><br />I hear fireworks. It makes me sad. I can't even get out and watch fireworks.&nbsp;<br />What happened to my summer?&nbsp;<br />It's better than last summer when I only got to see my now ex boyfriend like 4 times because he worked two jobs and never wanted to get together so I sat around all upset and depressed because I figured he didnt love me anymore...only to realize after he broke up with me that it was the truth and i just didnt want to face it because he was all i had. This summer I'm working from 8:10 to 5:30 then I come home and eat dinner and try to fit in a couple hours of homework before I go to bed at 10/10:30. And I'm going to get done with this class the first week of august. the second week i'll be working. then the saturday after the third week i'll be back to mansfield. I'll maybe get one week of no classes or work.&nbsp;<br /><br />J'deteste life.&nbsp;<br /></div>What happened to my motivation?&nbsp;<br />Maybe I should start looking for it."

"event","Summer isn't really summer this time around. It's actually been pretty crazy.&nbsp;<br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Although I love being random"">I decided to take summer classes online. I figured yeah, I need something to do so I don't sit around and think. Since anyone who knows me knows that me thinking is usually a bad thing. Yeah well in some ways I regret it. The past month has been rough keeping up with class work. I'm taking Film and Society which is almost over with...I have to watch up to 3 movies a week and not ones I can pick out either. I had to watch Silence of the Lambs...and I'm not a huge scary movie person unless I have someones arm to squeeze the blood out of lol...like when Eric and I saw Hulk. So then ontop of homework I started working this past week. Babysitting two kids (one 8 year old girl and one 4 year old boy). They rely on me to entertain them and it's kind of annoying. I grew up playing with my sister and cousin or with barbies or cars....anything to keep myself entertained. What's wrong with kids these days?&nbsp;<br /></div>Last week I wasn't myself. Infact for quite a few weeks I haven't been myself. I'm getting there though. I guess it's just stress. Eric and I started going back out a month and a day ago.<div class=""ljcut"" text=""It was probably one of the most nerve racking decisions I ever made"">Our last try at a relationship didn't go over very well at all. I gave him all of my heart and trusted him with my life and he lied to me about loving me so I'd stop being so upset and then we could fool around. The good news is that he regrets treating me like that. And things are going so much better now. Like super duper better. I'm still having a few problems remembering that he has changed and I have majorly changed and things aren't going to be like they were before. I'm not going to fall back into depression and he isn't going to give up on me. My parents still hate him and I tried talking about him when mom and i went out to eat tonight and she wouldn't say anything then change the topic. Owell. </div>I would like to apologize to Bethany. We've been kind of bitchy towards each other off and on in the past. Mainly over Eric or Hardcore. I just wanted to apologize for it all. I've changed a lot and I hope that we can put it all behind us.&nbsp;<br /><br />I can't wait to go on vacation to Virginia. I'm going to Busch Gardens and I'm determined to ride some rollercoasters. I never rode on any when we went a year or so ago with my parents and sister since they dont ride rollercoasters. And I didn't ride on any when we went for band because of the people i was stuck hanging out with didnt want to. I don't know which ones are better than others but I'm going on at least two.&nbsp;<br /><br />Laaaa.<br /><br />Yeah. I bought a dress to wear to the wedding I'm going to with Eric in August. It's in a bag on the floor. That's how messy my room is. I guess I should hang it up before it gets too wrinkly.&nbsp;<br /><br />Eric doesn't know it yet but Saturday night we're watching the Break Up. lol. I've been wanting to all week...<br /><br />I wish Aeropostale wasn't such an expensive store...I love their shirts!<br /><br />I bought a new romance mystery novel...by Christine Feehan. She wrote Wild Rain, which I loved. So I saw this one when some creepy guy talked to me in the bookstore at the mall. It sounds good. It's a 7 hour drive down to Virginia so I should be able to get two books for Baseball class read on the way down and back and the romance one while I'm on vacation. yay! It's called Dark Desire.<br /><br />Anyways, I guess I'm done rambling.&nbsp;<br />Back to work. and watching this extremely boring movie....ew older people making out..."

"event","They say don't dwell on the past. So I won't.&nbsp;
But man, I read through old journal entries looking for some advice for a friend.&nbsp;
I came across conversations with Hardcore. Where he's asking who I was going to do next.&nbsp;
One conversation Hardcore, Ben, Tim, and Adam were all telling me I was a liar when I said I have never been fingered. ...because they would know what happens to my body...
Another conversation (along with others) was about Eric and I...and Ben was telling me I needed to learn that he never loved me and I never loved him.

No wonder I was a wreck in high school. I had no confidence to begin with. I was depressed. And I had people left and right nagging me about my life which was none of their business. Good thing I'm not as weak as I was then. I've learned to stand up for myself. (I know, it's about time right?).
I'm not bringing up the past to start anything. I really could care less...it happened, it's over with...and I would never had remembered it if I hadn't been peering through old entries. I don't hold grudges that badly.&nbsp;

It's amazing how much I've changed. I know no one really cares. But I'm going to write this anyways lol. I was writing an email to a friend of mine who is falling into depression. It's a scary thing to be in and very few people understand how far deep I was into it all. It's the worst form of torture. But it was weird me being the one giving someone else the advice people had given me. Like how people can be assholes but they only get to you if you let them. To dismiss and let go. And most importantly: Life Goes On.&nbsp;

Even though old entries like the ones I came across piss me off (not as badly as they did then) I still would like to thank those people I put through hell. (although at times you did just as much to me). Looking back you guys really were just trying to help me and look out for me. It's just hard to see that when all you see is your world falling apart past the tears you're constantly fighting back.&nbsp;

Most of us don't keep in touch anymore. I can't even remember when the whole gang was together. And who knows...we probably all will never be together again. So if you were close to me in some degree in high school and you're reading this: Thank you. Every inch of support ...even the stuff that pissed me off and made me cry even more... really helped me get through it all and learn how to stand up for myself. I appreciate it. And I hope the best for all of you.&nbsp;

I guess I should finish up moving my junk around. I cleaned out my room and organized my junk. Just have a little bit more to take care of. I want to get it all done tonight. Tomorrow I'm going to Camp Lackawanna to spend the night with Eric. Coming back to the towanda/wysox area friday. Going to Body Electric. Maybe a movie. Spending the night with him. Then coming home in the morning. And saturday I have plans with family. So hopefully I can get the rest of this stuff cleaned up before I leave tomorrow.&nbsp;

And for those of you rolling your eyes or picking up your jaw that just dropped to the floor: Don't worry. I know to watch myself around him. Believe me...after how many heartaches and harsh words? I'd be the one to know when I need to get out of a situation. We're not going back out. We just started talking mid April when I unblocked him after about 5 months. We've talked a lot about our past. And we want to just spend some quality friendship time together.&nbsp;
...oh what am I doing? I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK!!!
hahaha.&nbsp;


Have a good summer everyone!"

I usually can only stand to be around music people for an hour but I figured, how often do I get dressed up for something and how much longer is my sister going to be in college? So I went. I knew most of the people and if I didnt know them I knew of them. Whether or not they knew me I don't know, nor do I care. I had fun...shook my booty all night. Ate a nice meal. Looked amazing (thank you Mark for doing my hair and make up). And yes I took that picture in the bathroom lol. The lighting was perfect I couldn't help myself.&nbsp;<br /><br />This monday-wednesday is finals week. Oh joy!!! I'm taking a break from studying right now. Nothing too exciting planned yet. Hopefully we can all get together tonight (me and my new found gang) since we will all be leaving this week.

I don't know what I'm doing Wednesday yet...I'll be done with finals that afternoon/evening. I might just have my parents come out and take some of my junk then take the rest of it out with my sisters stuff too on thursday that way I can stay and hang out with people one last night.

Adults: $12. Students/Seniors: $10.&nbsp;

Yes..the show is this upcoming thursday-sunday. I'm really excited but also really concerned. It's going to be hectic the next few days. Tonight is a full run through with costumes, hair, make up, orchestra for the first time, and lighting for the first time.

Just thought I'd share the dates and times and prices.&nbsp;
I'm a sexy big ass plate (seriously...our outfits are itty bitty). and a townsperson in Belle and the Mob Scene.&nbsp;

He might play the naked song and dedicate it to me lol. It should be an interesting night, but I'll just leave it at that.&nbsp;<br /><br />Last night was so much fun. I went to walmart with Kaitlyn, who didn't say like anything the whole time, Dessa, Cody, Allen (their RA who thinks i'm a drunk)&nbsp;Lloyd, and Dane. As soon as we walked in to walmart Dessa yelled out my name in this stupid way he does it lol. But I might've convinced Dane and Lloyd to get together and buy me flowers for christmas lol. While we were waiting for the bus to come back, i had lloyd on one side and dane on the other and we were sitting on these benches. dane learned that i'm ticklish and they ganged up on me lol. i ended up on the floor. it was great hanging out with them...even if kaitlyn was kind of being a bum and not talking to like anyone.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have a final on monday at 10:15 that i started studying for today. i'll study for it some more tomorrow since nothing is going on tomorrow. and i'll study for it sunday night after the band banquet. the band banquet is from 4:30 to 7 on sunday! that's like the whole day lol. Pastor Rich is taking us out to brunch after church sunday which is very nice of him. eat something besides manser. i also have a final thursday at 1 and one online which opens at 1 and i can take until midnight thursday. we're going to have a movie night every night next week to release some stress. i'm real worried about my finals. so it all depends on how much studying i get done.&nbsp;<br /><br />i'm excited about christmas break. and i'm excited about moving up to laurel (if there's an open room) in the spring. two great things to look forward to.&nbsp;<br /><br />things are going pretty well. i'm still alive. that's all that matters. <br /></div></font>"

Not as if I had a huge idea to begin with. I mean, I think what I'm in now is good for me, but I just don't know what is going to result from having my major and minor what they are.&nbsp;
I might've shrunk some pants. I'm not getting fatter so it must be that. Although last night I came to a decision that I'm fuckin hot and I don't care what anyone else says otherwise.&nbsp;
A lot of things are falling apart out here. But that stuff I will save for my friends only entry. Because honestly, I dont even know why I have this lj. The people that are on my 'friends list'...most of them don't keep in touch anymore. No matter how hard I try to leave messages or im them, I get nothing in return. I guess it sums up how my friendships have been. Who knows, maybe they did a better job at covering up not liking me than adam the asshole did. Seems to be the trend.&nbsp;
Fuck people and relationships. I dont need to be loved or cared about...I'm fine on my own.&nbsp;
Don't you hate it when you should be doing a million things and you aren't doing one of them? I should be up in the studio editing.

Now here I sit, wasting time writing to all of you who probably stopped reading after the first line.&nbsp;
Yep. Good stuff.&nbsp;
If you are on my friends only list, up next: more insightful stuff that you just might be interested in reading because you care that much about me. (maybe).&nbsp;

great response."

So today my 10:00 was canceled (same for Monday because my prof has a funeral to attend). And I get a message a few minutes ago from Jenelle saying that our 2:00 is canceled. That means I don't have any real classes today. :-D Just band at 4. then dinner. 

Too bad I have a shit load of studying to do for a midterm on thursday. After my 2:00 class friday I am done for the weekend. we have monday and tuesday off. well, kind of. I have something due tuesday for website design. I think I will stay out here friday and just chill. clean...i need to dust. get caught up in other work too. then saturday i'll go home. sunday i might be going to the mall with family. monday i dont know. tuesday i'll probably come back out early morning unless i come out monday night. 

i look like shit today and the best part is that i dont care. lol. 
things have been crazy lately. i dont know anymore. everything is falling apart. all i can do is laugh or else i'll end up crying. and i dont cry anymore so i guess i have to laugh. 

tomorrow will be 3 years since grandad passed away. don't get me started. 

dane was showing me pictures of his possee and telling me about all the fun they have and all this. it made me chuckle. things like that don't last. nothing does. i've been trusting people way too easily lately. i need to stop opening up and liking people. i already know what's going to happen...it happens every time. i'm so fuckin tired of it. 

lol my morning consisted of me in jeans and a bra cleaning up the dirt from my cactus that decided to fall over after a slight breeze through the window lol. i got up and there was dirt all over my desk. then i wham my knee against my desk. lol. what a day.

"event","<p>We added more moves to our field show today. It's going to be fun. I just hope everyone remembers them. It would also be nice if people would stop complaining about them...but that's asking for too much. If you have nothing to do Sunday, head down to Allentown. We'll be playing at 4:30 I believe. It does cost money to get in, but it's worth it. It's the Collegiant Marching Band Festival. We're 3rd from last. And we're gonna kick ass. </p>
<p>I've been in a weird funk the past couple weeks. But I'm kickin it out of here. lol get out of here old itchy ass hole. lol...sorry couldnt resist. Mainly it's just me thinking too much (nuff said).</p>
<p>So today has been a really good day in comparison to the past bunch. I slept in till 8. Made it to class on time. Didn't fall asleep. Then I went to allen and had to input the news from last night. Of course no one left me a script so I had to fish one out of the garbage (we have problems lol) but I captured all of the news so J to the second power and Justin can edit that today/tomorrow morning. Went to lower manser and took notes for that class. Went to upper at 1 for lunch. Then back to Allen to get my MU TvClub tshirt (yay) and to class at 2. Then I had band at 4-5:15 and we put horn moves and dance moves in (it reminded me of when christa and i did that one move from the audition for body electric). Then dinner...where I got a little irritated by certain people lol. Now I'm here, trying to get some motivation to figure out what I have left to do tonight for homework.&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh! I only have class at 10 and 4 friday...and I may not have the one at 10. It's even better because I don't have class till 2 tomorrow! :-D yay! lol<br />It only took one try to get the one contact in and two for the other. very happy day lol.<br /><br />I have a funny story to tell then I should go:<br />I was walking back to class, with my mp3 player on, and there were four guys in front of me who were going super slow. (grr) and there were a couple behind me. All the sudden the song changes and guess what comes on? Honkeytonkbadonkadonk. lol. I thought it was really funny. But maybe you had to be there because it really doesnt sound that funny lol. Owell. I tried.&nbsp;<br /><br />I guess I should've told my story about thinking the lightpost was the moon. lol.<br />xoxo</p>"

Because usually another door opens and the opportunity that is presented is just so much better and you wonder why you were so caught up in the original thing in the first place. I LOVE IT!<br /><br />So last night, Rosie, Shelly, Jess, Ash, Dane, and I walked to Walmart. Yes...we walked. Between 2 and 5 miles...we aren't quite sure exactly lol. It was a lot of fun...I had lots of energy to burn!&nbsp; We came back and made cookies and tshirts. It was a lot of fun.&nbsp;<br /><br />This morning I went to Church..for the first time in years. It was interesting. We talked about loving others...even when it's someone who you don't really get along with. It made me chuckle...I have a few people in mind. So that's what we are supposed to work on this week. The rest of the day today is a get work done day. Which is why I am writing this now to get it out of the way. lol. I have a buttload of work to do. Hopefully I'll be able to take breaks for Halo or pointillism or writing letters to people. I'll probably have to or else I'll loose concentration.&nbsp;<br /><br />I posted pictures from last night on facebook. If you don't have facebook I'm sorry lol. I don't feel like uploading pictures to photobucket or whatever and linking them to here. I don't have time. Hmmm. What else is there?&nbsp;<br /><br />When we were making tshirts last night, I thought of the shirts we made in high school. The Barraccuda shirts and the I dont curr I aint scurred shirts. hah. good times...</p>
<p>I have a friend who has a friend who is having problems accepting that her friends from high school are not keeping in touch as much as she thought they would. And you know what? It doesn't really bother me much anymore. If I see someone I went to high school with I'll say hi or whatever...or even online I try to talk to people from home. But if they don't want to keep in touch then owell...their loss. I don't really care if people keep in touch because that's just what happens. People come into your life and they leave. <br />I don't really miss high school much anymore either. I really love the college life. Things are going so much better this year for me. Unfortunetly there is still drama...but I am trying to ignore it. </p>
<p>Ok I'm sure no one really cares about anything Im rambling on about lol. </p>
<p>I have work to do anyways...</p>"

Last night I was a rebel and stayed up till 1 in the morning. I heart late night chats and my guy friends.&nbsp;
Alex called me twice this morning. I laughed for an hour.
I need to finish packing tonight. And figure out why my printer wont print.&nbsp;
Fireworks in Monroeton tomorrow night. I'm going since I'm missing Riverfest. Not sure how I'm getting there...considering my cars muffler is shot. But I'm goin. lol.
I hate being poor. I have $7.64 in my account.&nbsp;
Tomorrow marks 10 months for alex and i.&nbsp;
I love looking through old pictures. I found some from the beach sophomore year. Back before Tims hair went on a growing spree. Back when I was still in depression. Back before Christa started loosing weight and looking even more beautiful than she already did. Back when I was still really good friends with people I can't stand anymore.&nbsp;
haha. Speaking of people I can't stand...I had a funny dream the other night. I think it proves I need to let go of some inner anger. lol. I'd tell you about it but you'd think I was crazy.
Oh shucks. I don't want to get back to packing.&nbsp;
I love listening to the dentist and his assistant talk while they are working on my teeth. You never know what you'll learn.
Had a good time last night with Peg even though my car decided to be flamboiant.&nbsp;
Dinner was only 7 dollars because the lady messed up our order. Yay cheap food.&nbsp;

So the main reason that I'm writing this is not to fill you with useless knowledge of my life but to let you know that I'm going to (not change my screen name haha) and start putting this on friends only.

So...I know I'm friending a few people and I'm sure you know who you are...but if you want to be friended and fill your mind with useless knowledge of my life then please respond. I'm not a mind reader.

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Seriously"">It's really unbelieveable how drastic my mood can change in a week. I really believe that Kas was right when he said I am like a Jekeld and Hyde (how the hell do you spell that lol). Anyways, I'm fine one minute and pissed the next. But this past week I realized how horrible of a person I have been this summer. Laying around bitchin about how I can't find a job and therefore must be worthless. I figured since Ben and Christa are too busy to hang out with Steve and I that they must not like me anymore. I convince myself of these negative thoughts and truely believe them....wether they are correct or not. So about Tuesday or Wednesday I decided I hated myself. I'm always negative and sad and gloomy. Nothing has ever, in the past four, five years, has been good enough for me. I honestly rarely laugh anymore...which to me should be one of the top sins of all time. I even convinced myself that Alex would leave me any moment now because I haven't changed in the ways I wanted to this summer.&nbsp;<br />No, this summer hasnt been what I expected...at all. I figured we'd all be hanging out and having fun. I'd get a job. Spend some time with my family and once in awhile visit alex. But since only some of those have happened and not all of the way I wanted, I got upset and gloomy and figured I'd give up. Then after having a heart-to-heart with steve late one night and some encouraging words from alex, something clicked and I was like 'woah now...i'm being gay.' (not literally). So for the past few days I have been working on staying positive and not letting the small things that go wrong in life bother me. Every morning, as pathetic as this sounds, I read some random pieces of advice in the Dont Sweat the Small Stuff book I have. That way, before I even get out of bed, I have my mind in the right frame of mind. I've also been trying to think of three things each day that I am grateful for. I even go to the extreme of telling myself good morning, etc, in the mirror. Hey they say it works and I am willing to do almost anything to be happy again. It's been almost what? three years since I last cut myself. I don't want to fall into that trap again...lol I'm a teenage warrior and I'm better than that.&nbsp;<br />So yeah....things have been rough this summer. But I'm changing myself around so that I don't end up like my parents (who are both major negative thinkers...where I get my negativity from).&nbsp;</div>
<br /><br />In much better news, I saw Alex last night for the first time in over a month. And since I was trying all of these new ideas to be happier and not worry about the future, it was pretty great. I didn't cry when I saw him, I didn't sit and think about how in a few hours I'd have to leave him. I just enjoyed sitting there next to him, watching a&nbsp;baseball game. It was the first time my family has met anyone in his family (his dad went with us). I think it went pretty well. Usually, I cry when I have to say goodbye to him. For some reason it went to extremes last school year and I'd cry when he left my room at night. (dont ask why...i've been trying to figure it out for months). But this time, I'm so proud of myself...I didn't cry. Yay!! lol. It was so much fun and I love him so much. I can't wait for the 24th when I get to see him again.&nbsp;<br /><br />ok...enough mushy stuff. lol.&nbsp;<br />Steve and I went out to Troy the other day and took his grumpy brother to his practice. While we waited for that to end we played some mini golf...steve beat me by a little bit (supposedly). lol. and we had some food. Before all that we were swimming. My first (and probably last) time in a pool this summer. Owell. It was fun.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today I slept in till 9. Hercules is on right now, watched some ghost stuff this morning. My cousin will be here around 4:30. We're going to dinner at 5/5:30 at the train station. Then seeing Pirates again because my dad hasnt seen it and we were like you must.&nbsp;<br /><br />Speaking of films, I think it'd be so cool to work on a film like that. It'd suck doing all the traveling. It'd be hard on any close relationship/possible marriage/settling down having a family things. But even just to do one film for the experience. That'd be great. I also decided, with some inspiration from steve, that photography would be a fun job too. Just sit around and take pictures all day. lol. There are a lot of possiblities with this broadcasting stuff I'm into (even more once I learn stuff from my web page design course this fall). So I'm sure I'll find something to keep me entertained when I'm older.&nbsp;<br /><br />I think this update should last a couple weeks. lol. I won't be updating until August probably. So hopefully everyone is enjoying their summer...it's almost over!&nbsp;<br />"

I'm not going to ramble on and on about what has been bothering me because i'm not like that anymore. the only person i have hung out with much this summer is steve. not that there's anything wrong with steve-he's basically all I have here anymore. in a way i miss the old possee. but at the same time i know it will never be like it was because we have all changed since then.&nbsp;<br />this weekend i had two of my cousins over for a sleepover. seemed like everything went NOT according to plan. part of my tooth came off where i needed a filling on saturday and i finally got that fixed today. we thought there were three times i needed to get cavities fixed but today they told us there are three left. I hate it when people don't come right out and tell me what is going on with my mouth. i spent tons of money on it and would really appreciate it if they didnt just suspect I know what's going on.&nbsp;<br />i have a bad habit of holding on to the past and letting it interfere with the present. i've been doing way too much thinking lately. thinking about how horrible of a person i was in high school, wondering what i ever did to not be liked and be called a cunt by an asshole, wonder what in the world made me want to go after eric time after time even though he hurt me so bad. i considered getting a councelor but i think i just need to start writing in a pen and paper journal so i can let it all out. i've always been horrible at letting out how i feel. i don't trust that many people...in fact i only trust Alex, Steve, and Megra. So i dont have anyone to vent to.&nbsp;<br />i really cant wait to go back to mansfield. i have a lot to figure out before then though...<br /><br />i finished steves computer part and i wanted to get some pictures outside with it but it has been raining for the past like forever. i might do some painting today. it sucks not having a job but at the same time i'm glad i'm not sitting around complaining about having to go to work. <br /></div>
<br />even though things haven't been that great for me i sure hope that everyone else is enjoying their summer vacation.&nbsp;<br />I haven't seen Alex since the 9th and wont until the 14th when we go to a baseball game with my parents, Amanda, and Alexs dad.&nbsp;<br />Then the last week of July i will be spending that with Alex.&nbsp;<br /><br />My summer is almost over already. I leave the 19th of August for band camp and won't be able to come home on weekends for awhile with football season.<br /><br />nothing much else to say...no one to say anything to anyways."

Feel free to be excited.&nbsp;<br /><br />Haha last night my mom made me talk to my grandma while i had my retainers in and so I asked her ""do you wear boots?"" and of course mom thought I said 'boobs' instead of 'boots' because with retainers in i sound silly. My grandma was so tired last night that she just laughed on and on about that one. <br /></div>
<br />Let's just put everything behind us and start new."

"event","You know what I have realized? A little kid can brighten anyones bad mood. I have been in a weird mood today and off and on this past week. But today from 4-7 I babysat a 4 year old. His 2 year old sister was there for the first hour with her grandma. She is adorable! I was just on the phone with Lily and Zena, two of my cousins. They are all going to be over here tomorrow for my birthday. 

Speaking of my birthday it was ok. (reasons it wasnt great are none of anyones buisness) I really enjoyed seeing Alex for the first time in almost a month. I might go to his place in July. He's coming up for the Troy Fair (well the concert...not the fair). And that will more than likely be it until band camp at the end of august. A week from tomorrow will be 8 months. i love him so much. (ok i'll shut up now lol).

I have a lot to sort out this summer and I hope that I get through this awkward in between phase soon. 

Alex bought me a kitty necklace, a kenneth cole watch, a tank top, a shirt, two boxes of tastey cakes that i like, Norah Jones piano book, and a card. (well, his mom got me some of those..some he got while he was in new york city). Amanda got me two workout videos: cardio dance blast and cardio salsa. Mom and Dad gave me some of my presents from them thursday too. I got Music and Magic of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Has a collection of songs from musicals he has done and a dvd of Phantom i'm guessing...havent played with it yet. and i got a pair of gauchos because they are so comfy but i think we are going to return them and find something else b/c they dont look as nice on me as my other pair does. 
And of course my new digital camera that my grandma sara and my parents got together and paid half and half for me. 

I bought myself a cd at FYE Thursday when we went to the mall. Less Than Jake. Figured that more than likely my aunts and grandma werent getting me that. lol.

I'm starving. I think supper should be ready soon."

i can't get ahold of any of my t-town possee so i figure that everyone is busy. but that's ok. i have a fun day planned for alex and i for friday so it'll be fine. hopefully everyone is having fun doin whatever everyone is up to.
i heard that they are looking for alumni to play at graduation. i would but i can't. i sat through enough boring graduations anyways. good luck and congrats to the grads though. 

i went into school today with amanda. i never felt so out of place. i did see kas and shane and a few other people i kind of know/knew. but still. 

fit tv is fun. amanda and i did an hour of it last night...killer.

i volunteered from 5 to 7 at the monroeton library. shelved books and got myself a library card. it's a cute little library. 
i've been working hard on steves computer and i hope to get it done before my birthday. 
if anyone wants to hang out with alex and i Friday the 9th, let me know. he'll be here around 2:00 on my birthday, leaving at around noon saturday. i haven't seen him since we left mansfield. but i talk to him almost every day so it's okay. lol. ummm. i thought about (for friday) going someplace but it depends on who (if anyone) wants to hang out or whatever. So just let me know.

hmmm. i need some motivation to get myself doing things i want to do/learn how to do this summer. if only they sold bottles of motivation at the store."

"event","i guess i've felt that way off and on over the years and i have never brought it up because i didn't want things to go bad between the three of us. it's probably nothing but it was just something i needed to get off my mind. it's like the first time the three of us hung out after we got out of college and it was really awkward. i felt like it was because of me and i couldnt figure out what it was. it was the same things when it was the 'possee'-i always felt like there was no point in me being there. (glad that group is over). i'm sure once summer kicks into gear for me it'll be better. the first few weeks here have been dragging on too slowly for me and it's driving me crazy.

i got an early birthday present yesterday. it's a new camera yay! it's awesome and i'm going picture crazy. 
i went to see over the hedge with phil last night. it was a cute movie actually. (but yet i'm one of those people who likes kids movies). then we hung out with steve and nate and christa joined after she was done at work. 
tomorrow family stuff at my grandmas. lily is turning 10 (gosh i feel old). 

i should take care of my laptop. it's sitting on a tray downstairs and i'm worried that the dog is going to knock it over."

"event","i slept in/layed in bed till noon fourty. i decided i deserve an extremely lazy morning after waking up by 9 every morning and because of how horrible my summer has been. i realized last night that it's not me that doesn't fit in with my friends. instead maybe it's just that sometimes i feel like i give so much to people. i always put people first and want my friends to have the spot light over me. if one of my friends...no matter how close i was or wasnt with them, if they had to move away from the group to a different seat of the theater because some fat guy sat infront of them so they couldnt see; i would get up and sit somewhere else with them. no questions asked. last night when that happened to me and no one...not even my own sister, came to sit with me...i wondered why i give so much. i'm not saying anything against any of the people i was there with. it just made me think. i mean who wants to sit through a movie by themselves? if i wanted to do that i would've. alex would've moved to a different seat with me. i can't convince him to let me stay with him the rest of summer. he has friends, two jobs, he knows how to cook. i wish i had something like that. oh and speaking of friends...my friends think i'm stupid. no, i couldn't figure out how to work your new phone christa. no, i don't know how to cook. but there's no reason to say when i turn my back 'oh my gosh she couldn't figure out how to turn a phone on?' yeah maybe i'm over reacting. but look at the people i have been friends with over the years. like michele who used me first semester to make friends and once she felt comfortable she ditched me. i just don't understand. am i that bad of a person? maybe i'm just too nice. maybe i'm making too big of a deal about it. i just wish i could find one friend that i could trust and open up around and be myself around and not feel like i'm being judged or that i don't fit in. i'm tired of feeling like i can't be myself around my friends. how i felt when i got home isn't something that i should have to feel almost every day of summer. i don't deserve it.

i feel like i sound selfish or stuck up or something. but i know i'm not the only one who knows what i'm talking about. 
owell. shit happens, life goes on...right?

10 days till i finally get to see Alex. :-D"

"event","it only took me two weeks or so but my room is officially cleaned out and all of the stuff from mansfield is put away in my room or boxed up for next year. Very exciting. today i might redecorate because i found a lot of posters and i bought some out at MU. it's time for some changes in posters anyways. 

vacation started out pretty shitty but it's getting better. i still haven't found a job. but i'm not going to worry about it too much. besides cleaning my room and hanging out with my moms side of the family on mothers day, i had a good time hanging out with steve, tim, and ben at steves house the other day and playing volleyball with the gang and steves family. and last night steve came over and watched rocky horror (i hope to find other versions of the script today). 

there are 17 days till my birthday! i'll be 19. i have no idea what i'm doing for my birthday. it'd be a lot of fun to do a rocky horror night like we were jokin about last night. it would be fun to go to alexs house and see his parents and hang out at the millions of places we could go. it'd be fun to go rollerskating or bowling or to a movie. but my birthday is around the same time as graduation and i don't know when people have to work or whatever. alex said he might come up the 7-9. my party with family will be on sunday. so i dont know. maybe i wont do anything. 

i wish it would be nice outside so i can tan. but no...it just has to be 50 degrees out. 
owell.

"event","Within the first week back for vacation and I've had multiple people say something about how young they think I am or how small I am. I just hate it. I'm small. So what? I think my size is just fine and there's nothing wrong with being slender. I'm healthy, I'm strong, I'm beautiful, and I don't care what people have to say about any of that. I'm sorry if my last entry offended anyone but it's just that I expected more from the people who have known me the longest. Figured they were over the 'oh my gosh you're so small' phase considering I haven't changed in size much since they met me. 

I can't find a job. I applied to Kmart and P&C. Stopped in to P&C and asked where my application stood and they said they weren't hiring...which is bull since there have been new people there the past few days. I saw jerry at the Y and talked to him for awhile. Then he told this lady, I guess the boss, that he found a new employee (meaning me). And she said ""I don't think you'd make the age limit"" and I came close to punching her in the face and said ""i'll be 19 in june"" and she replied ""oh, I guess it's just that baby face"" grrrr. freakin bitch. I know she didn't mean anything by it but ugh I'm so tired of it. If it's not how young I look it's like the doctor asking me if I eat. 

So my dad called down to the Monroeton Library and asked about volunteer work that my grandmother said she heard about. So if they need me I'll get a phone call tomorrow or the next day about it. Since I can't find a job, I'll volunteer my time. I need something to do because I'm almost done cleaning out my room. It's looking much better but I still have a whole wall to do. And the one shelf. And i want to take down all of my posters and redecorate. I also have lots of stuff from mansfield still in boxes in different rooms of the house. 

June will be a busy month. My birthday on the 8th. I think we're having a garage sale that weekend. three of my cousins have birthdays in June. So I'll have lots of weekends full of birthdays. I was going to go to alexs house for my birthday but I don't know. Probably don't have any friends out here anymore. It's weird...people at mansfield never really said much and if they did it was because they just met me or whatever. And alex is the same size as me so I was used to my sized people. Then I come out here and everyone are giants. Yeah that's right, i'm a itty bitty girl and you are all giants. 

I might go into band and chorus tomorrow before I go to jandrew to get a dress made into a tank top by some lady my mom works with. Wednesday I have a dentist appt at noon. Yay clean teeth. They haven't seen my teeth without braces yet. Maybe I'll get a sticker. Other than that, nothing much planned for the rest of May. Thursday is 7 months for Alex and I. yay. I miss him. But it's ok. 

I guess that's about it. I'm still hungry (my appetite is back now that I'm around good food) so I guess I'll find some foodage.

Sorry again if I upset anyone or hurt anyone by flipping out about the size thing. I just wish people would understand that it's not fair that people can come up to me and ask if I'm anorexic but I can't go up to the millions of people in america who are overweight and ask them when don't they eat. You know? Owell. 

Oh, one last thing. First semester I had 2 Cs i think and overall a GPA of 2.9. This semester, my lowest grade was 2 Bs (the midterm for one was a C so I was worried) and ended up with a 3.5. I guess a decent grade/gpa is possible when you have no social life and study harder. lol. yay me. I asked my mom if she would reward me with a new car and she's like 'oh i wish i could' lol. so do i."

I look so cute...awww lol.&nbsp;<br /><br />So today was the last day of classes (yesssss). I am so glad all of that homework and stuff is over. All I have to do now is pack and study. Unfortunetly exams aren't any better than what we go through during the year. Alex has to go to a wedding in New Jersey this weekend so he's not here. And Kaitlyn (my roomate) went home for the weekend. So I'm all by myself. le sigh. Yeah, it's kind of boring. But maybe I'll get more things done that way. I already have a lot of stuff packed. My parents are coming out tomorrow for lunch and we're going to load stuff into the escape so they can take a bunch of my junk back home (where am I going to put all of this stuff?!). I have one final on monday and I need to get Prof Wright to sign my change in major form. Tuesday I have two finals. So I could leave then...I'll have to see. I also need to buy back books. Last semester I only got $25 or so. Owell. I'm still looking for a job since I haven't gotten a call back. Kind of sucks. I might end up just having to mow my grandmothers lawn and hope she pays me...I don't know. :( I really want a job. (how often do you hear people saying that? lol).&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm going to the gym soon. I was going to go at 9. But I think I'd rather go like soon. Then come back and relax for awhile, play some xbox or watch a movie then go to bed. I have lots of studying to do within the next few days. I can't wait for it all to be over!&nbsp;<br /><br />Ooo. I got a dvd of tvclub stuff. I might put that in quick to see if Darrin did it right and it worked out. <br /><br />Well I guess that's it! I probably won't update as much over vacation since I don't plan on being online much. I want to get up off my butt and doing things this summer as much as possible. (and learn to swim!).&nbsp;<br /><br />So...I hope everyone enjoys their vacation and I'll see ya around!<br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Seriously,"">But really, I am so glad that summer vacation is coming up and that my first year of college is behind me. It's nice to be through that awkward first step of starting off somewhere new (and unfortunetly for me, on the wrong foot). But I'm back on track and doing better than ever! I plan on getting a job this summer (if i cant find one I'll walk around asking people if I can mow their lawn for money...just to warn ya). I plan on working on scrapbooking stuff because I want to redo the one that I started (it sucks ass...looks like a teenager did a shitty attempt at it. oh wait). I plan on working out somehow...i've heard lots of different prices for three month membership at the Y so if it is expensive I'll just walk/ride bike every day and attempt to keep myself going that way. I want to stay active (not sexually you sicko). I want to go camping, go to Knoebles (a trip with friends would be a fun new experience...probably would work out better than say the mall). I might double date or more than that with Alex and some of his friends from home and go to Knoebles. That'd be fun.&nbsp;<br /><br />For my birthday...I don't know yet. If your name is Steve, Christa, or Ben...and are interested in doing something: talk to me. Alex gave me an idea but I don't know what you guys are doing or if you are interested in doing something for my b-day. If not I'll just say hey, anyone who wants to show up at my house....can! (doubt mom would like that one haha)<br /><br />Speaking of my mother...we went out to that Turkey Grill place for lunch yesterday. hahaha. I drove my car with alex and my mom, grandma, sister, and couple cousins were in my moms escape, and my aunt was in her what? dodge or somethin with a bunch more family. I was in the tail end. The speed limit is what 65 on that road? I was going like 50 and getting passed (i was at the end keep in mind). So I was getting tired of it...and it was on our way back so I knew how to get back and was going to&nbsp;a seperate place so I decided to pass them. Passed my aunt, finally got to 60, passed my mom, finally got to around 65/70. It was funny. My mom said that my grandma was just about ready to have&nbsp; a heartattack (not literally of course). I've never passed a family member on a road before because I've never been aloud to drive on highway-like roads until this year. But it was fun. haha. I'm such a rebel, i know.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well I'd love to ramble on some more (that's what I'm best at) but i have a paper to finish and hand in tomorrow.&nbsp;<br />Alex and I are going to the playground tonight and we're going to play catch with the nerf football i bought yesterday! yay! it's going to be crazy surviving the summer without him. i'm sure i'll have plenty of other things to keep me busy though.&nbsp;<br /><br />have a marvelous day! it's beautiful out!<br />(when i dont have to wear a sweatshirt or longsleeve shirt on my way to class you know it's nice out).<br /><br />bye!</div>"

And I have math homework due friday. That's it for this week. Next week I'll have to work on another paper. And the week of the 8th in May is finals week. Tres Exciting!<br />I enjoy my freedom out here. But yet at the same time, I'm bored of the school work...not tired of it, don't hate it...just tired of it. I need something different.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have been really clumsy today. I stubed my toe on steves computer part this morning. I ran the side of my leg into the metal part of alexs bed frame, his head slammed into my ear and made my ear burn, he knocked his head off mine...notice how all of these things happened when he was around. haha. owell.&nbsp;<br /><br />Speaking of Alex, our 6 months was yesterday. Gave me an excuse to think about him all day. But...he's been sleeping over monday night and last night and I haven't gotten much sleep. For those of you who haven't seen a bed in Cedarcrest let me describe them to you: SHITTY and SMALL. I luckily have the bed to myself tonight and plan on catching up on my sleep (no class till 11 tomorrow which makes it that much better!).&nbsp;<br /></div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Wow you look amazing!"">So Saturday at 2:00 is my last Sympho Concert and possibly my last Concert concert. I don't know if I'll continue with concert band. It just doesn't interest me anymore. My parents are going crazy every time I mention it (god forbid i dont do concert band). I am very excited about marching band in the fall (blood sweat and tears is the theme!) but concert band is just a pain and a waste of time to me. Anyways, so Saturday at 2 I'll be doing that. Then I'm going home to see the Musical (yay) or at least I hope this is still the plans since my mom hasn't ordered tickets yet.....<br /><br />Hmmmm. What else? Nothing much to say really besides what I just wrote about. I haven't gone to the gym in awhile. But I still feel the burn doing my 'flip flop workout' as alex picks on me about. (you really do get a muscle workout wearing flip flops in mansfield). TVClub drama is still going on. I brought out my xbox and JJ invited himself over to beat Kaitlyn and I but uh...don't know if we'll let him in or not. lol. Hmmm. I guess that's about it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Half an hour till dinner so I guess I should get around.&nbsp;<br />I absolutely love this weather! yay for spring!</div>

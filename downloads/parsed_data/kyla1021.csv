<br />Kindness is most important in a boyfriend/girlfriend.  You want someone who will go through everything with you - the best moments and the worst, and all of those other moments in between.  You love to be able to say anything to your partner, and have them say anything to you.  You are able to be extremely close with your partner for that reason.<br />

"event","I really can't believe how good everything is going so far this year.  Part of last year was fun, but to be completely honest I was miserable most of the time and I was always counting the days until I got to go home.  I cried a lot and I didn't even know why.  This year everything has been going great, to a point where I am waiting for something to go wrong... just like it did last year.  I can't help but thinking that way...it's just that I have a hard time believing that everything is going to be better this year because of a few great girls that I met. 

I am really hoping that I'll be this happy for the rest of the year, and perfectly content staying away from home.  I no longer count the days until I go home, I actually lose track of time up here and have my mom say ""we haven't seen you for over 3 weeks are you going to come home soon?"""

""You Gotta Be"" 

Listen as your day unfolds 
Challenge what the future holds 
Try and keep your head up to the sky 
Lovers, they may cause you tears 
Go ahead release your fears 

Stand up and be counted 
Don't be ashamed to cry 

You gotta be 
You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold 
You gotta be wiser, you gotta be hard 
You gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger 

You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm 
You gotta stay together 
All I know, all I know, love will save the day 

Herald what your mother said 
Readin' the books your father read 
Try to solve the puzzles in your own sweet time 
Some may have more cash than you 
Others take a different view 
My oh my heh, hey 

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold 
You gotta be wiser, you gotta be hard 
You gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger 
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm 
You gotta stay together 
All I know, all I know, love will save the day 

Don't ask no questions, it goes on without you 
Leaving you behind if you can't stand the pace 
The world keeps on spinning 
You can't stop it, if you try to 
This time it's danger staring you in the face 

Oh oh oh Remember 
Listen as your day unfolds 
Challenge what the future holds 
Try and keep your head up to the sky 
Lovers, they may cause you tears 
Go ahead release your fears 
My oh my heh, hey, hey 

You gotta be 
You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold 
You gotta be wiser, you gotta be hard 
You gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger 
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm 
You gotta stay together 
All I know, all I know, love will save the day

It is also my last day of my 6:00-7:15 class :)

Originally we had plans for him to come up here and go out to eat Friday night...But he went to the doctor and found out that he's sick.  The doctor gave him some medicine, but he's still not feeling so hot.  Earlier today he said that he would still come up, but then he called a little bit later and said that he was probably going to wait until Saturday morning to come up so that he could get some rest.  Of coarse I was bummed out because I've been wicked excited about our plans for Friday.  And obviously Geoff could tell that I was disappointed so he was saying that he would just come up Friday.  So as usual I've made Geoff feel bad, and now I feel guilty.

Id like him to come up, but now I'm hoping that he'll just stay home Friday night so he'll feel better...I guess I'll just have to find something to do all by my lonesome :("

I think I'm going to finish my homework while it's quiet in my room.  Then I'll go to the gym for a couple of hours, because that's the only thing that takes my mind off of everything else."

Unfortunately a friend of hers kind of got ditched by the girl she had planned to room with.  So now Jenna is going to room with her.  So now I am basically stuck in the same boat that I was in before.  If I went into this expecting nothing, I wouldn't I have felt as disappointed. 

But Jenna and I are planning on hanging out anyway.  So I guess I gained a friend."

"event","So yeah, Geoff called before I was heading off to class to give me some ""good news"" earlier.  I had absolutely no idea what the ""good news"" was...this is Geoff we are talking about.

He had talked to his parents and they told him that after we get married, and they retire (well his Dad already retired...) we can have their house.  Well they aren't going to just hand over the house to us, we will buy it, except it won't be EXTREMELY expensive...like every house in Rockport.  Geoff had mentioned the possibility of this happening before, but I didn't know whether or not his parents were serious about it...until now.

It's funny that we are talking about this now since...
1.) We are both under 20
2.) We're both in college
3.) Not engaged/married...yet :)

But then again we have been together for over 3 years.  We plan on being engaged (by senior year) and married (probably after Grad school.) Well despite all of this it just seems crazy that we have a ""potential"" house to buy."

a.) no one else would show up
or 
b.) they would all be really weird and crazy

  About 5 other girls showed up and everyone seemed to be really nice.  There was one girl that I really got along with, she was awesome.  We seemed to have a lot and common and we kept making eachother crack up.  After we met and talked to everyone, we all wrote down the names of any of the girls that could be potential roomates.  The two of us put down eachother.  I'm just hoping that I'm her top pick out of the other girls because we seemed to have A LOT in common.  Hopefully we'll get eachother's information soon and hang out and maybe even room together :)"

<P>This weekend was pretty fun.&nbsp; Geoff came up and surprised me with a dozen red roses for our three year anniversary...that was definitely unexpected (because we made an agreement not to get each other anything,)but it definitely brightened up my day.&nbsp; Dinner was great, we were cracking up most of the time.&nbsp; We ate so much food that we both felt sick afterwards...oh it was pretty gross.&nbsp; He definitely made me feel much better about the everything that was stressing me out.&nbsp; Thanks to him I got some time to just sit back, relax, and have some fun.&nbsp; If only everyday could be like that.</P>

"event","Yesterday was definitely a stressful day for me.  I had a lot of work that I had to do, and I also had a lot on my mind.  I tried to brush the stress aside and keep doing my work, and then my mom called.  I told her what was going on, and she was worried that I was holding things off (which I'm not) and that my GPA would drop and I'd get booted out of the school because there is no way I could afford to go here without my scholarships.

Another thing that is really starting to bother me again is being alone.  I'm so sick of feeling alone when I'm surrounded my hundreds of people.  I'm sick of eating alone, sitting in my room, crying, and trying to convince myself that everything will change.  Geoff has mentioned that I should look at other colleges, but I'm not fully convinced that it would change much.  I really like the teachers, classes and major that I have.  There aren't many schools that offer child development as a major.  I don't really know what to do, or even say anymore.  I've pretty much convinced myself that things here will never get better, they'll only get worse, no matter where I go.

Time to go eat brunch alone."

I'm a bit ticked off (just in case I didn't make that clear).  Well now that I got that off my chest... my only class was canceled so now I get to sit around in my room all day (until the 12:30-5 work study,) how exciting for me.

Now I'm debating whether or not to stay up here until spring break...as long as Geoff comes up I'm sure I'll manage to get by.  I wish it was FRIDAY!!!"

"event","The three day weekend went by waaaaaay to fast.  I watched ""The Notebook"" again, this time with my mom...I don't think I've ever seen her cry so much in my life. But I think that it's good to have a good cry every once in a while. Despite the fact that she cried a lot, she really liked the movie; she stole the movie from me so that she can make her sister(s) and my dad watch it.

Geoff and I took Jeffrey out to eat.  We spent a lot of time catching up with his parents and my parents.  It was pretty fun. We (Geoff and I) went to see the movie ""Hitch"" which was actually better than what I had expected. 

I am planning on staying up here until spring break with Linds.  I am sure that Geoff will definitely come up to visit on the weekends too."

2.) Stats test is now open book, and notebook (I'll probably still manage to fail)

3.) Child Psych lab- 96 my first grade in the class

4.) Child Psych test...now small in class quiz on ALP format and a take-home test that we have a week to complete

5.) I'm all done with classes for today, now I get to play with the cute toddlers.

6.) Linds finally gets to bring her car up.  Now we don't have to bum rides off of our friends.

Oh this has nothing to with today...but I think I forgot to mention it.  Linds and I are definitely playing floor hockey.  We just joined Sarah's team because we knew that we would never be able to find enough girls for our team."

"event","Today was an ok day.  Nothing great happened and nothing bad happened.  I stayed up pretty late with Linds last night (it's starting to become a bad habit for us)so I was pretty sleepy.  I dragged myself to stats and tried to squeeze in a quick nap before my next class.  As usual, the whole nap thing didn't really work out as I had hoped...so I was feeling tired and groggy for the rest of the day.

After my late class (from 6:00-7:15)I was planning on going to the gym with Linds and Jen. Linds didn't feel like going, she wanted to be lazy and sit in the room to eat a pint of ice cream. Of coarse that was not an option because we both made a deal to work out every night that we are up here. 

Eventually we compromised and went to go rock climbing on the wall.  Considering that I have never gone before, I did pretty good.  The first time I went up I took the easiest route and got up to the top surprisingly fast.  The second time I went on a different rope on a harder route, and I still managed to make it to the top alive.  I had a pretty good time, I'll definitely do it again."

I find this very entertaining because she was making fun of me for crying last night when I watched it with Geoff.  I'd say that she is just as bad as Brenna when it comes to crying in chick flicks, if not worse.  I found out that she hasn't seen some other really good sad movies that I've seen...so now I have to make her watch those with me too.  Well it about 1 am...time for bed because I am sleepy."

"event","So, reading over Yahoo news on my lunch break and I stumble on this little gem of an article.  I've had many a discussion with people on the same topic - what if it were Americans instead of Iraqis in this situation and relying heavily on Revolutionary War symbolism, but this guy hits it home.  No matter what side you fall on on any of this, it does make you stop and think 'What would I be willing to do?'

<b>Got Empathy?</b>

by Ted Rall

Americans Cheer Fictional Insurgents, Real-Life Invaders.

Sounds like a movie, huh? ""Red Dawn"" is a classic document of Reagan-era jingoism filtered through Cold War paranoia. Audiences cheered American nationalist insurgents as they blew holes through onscreen Soviet conscripts in 1984. Rent it today and you will too.

The mid-'80s were good for fictional American resistance movements. The miniseries ""V,"" which premiered in 1983, was followed by a 1985 sequel and eventually a full-fledged weekly TV series, focused on a cell of underground resistance fighters who bombed police stations, government offices and important infrastructure--including an oil refinery!--in the course of a long, brutal and desperate war against reptilian invaders from outer space. (The clever creatures disguise themselves in human form to get the locals to cooperate.) The series' writers kept things interesting by writing lots of moral ambiguity into their scripts. Some aliens form a ""fifth column"" allied with the human resistance movement while some earthlings sell out their neighbors and relatives, but none of that matters in the end. You still root for the men and women the government and official media call ""terrorists.""

1985 saw the widescreen release of a remake of the '50s Red Scare flick ""Invasion, U.S.A.,"" this time with mullet-tressed action hero Chuck Norris deploying heavy weaponry against fiendish commie saboteurs wreaking havoc in the streets of, inexplicably, south Florida.

The more stuff Chuck blows up, the louder we applaud. After all, he ain't no terrorist--he's a freedom fighter, albeit a poorly-directed one clumsily reading incredibly stupid lines.

Cheering for the underdog is as American as fatty food. In the movies we love heroes who simply want to be left alone--but are willing, like Charles Bronson in ""Death Wish,"" to dish out double-sized portions of blazing revenge when the baddies cross the line. Why, then, don't we pull for the Iraqi insurgents? They are, like Clint Eastwood in his '70s and '80s action flicks, fighting back against overwhelming odds. And most, like Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen in ""Red Dawn,"" are high school kids who, at first resigned to the U.S. invasion, take up arms in disgust at an increasingly abusive and hostile army of occupation. Americans play opposite roles in the two scenarios, yet we identify with Americans in both. Where the heck is our sense of empathy? Why can't we see ourselves in the faces of those kids firing RPGs at convoys of Halliburton trucks stealing Iraqi oil?

Here's the rub:     Iraq's resistance fighters are breaking a lot of eggs to cook their omelet of liberation. They kill other Iraqis. They kidnap and execute foreign aid workers, truck drivers, businessmen, even diplomats and children. Americans, we tell ourselves, would never resort to that kind of terrorism--not even to free ourselves from occupation.

Wouldn't we?

Imagine America under the jackboot of, say, Icelandic occupation. At first many Americans are happy to see Bush arrested and put on trial, but it doesn't take long before we start to miss him. Promises of rapid rebuilding evaporate. Two years after saturation bombing has leveled Washington, Los Angeles, New York and other major cities, the rubble is overrun with rats and wild dogs. America's natural resources--coal, lumber, oil--are shipped back to Iceland without recompense. Unmarked checkpoints spring up everywhere, transforming a drive to the 7-11 to get water--faucets are dry--into a potentially lethal exercise. Icelandic troops conduct house raids to take away Americans' guns. Since there's no electricity for streetlights, the night belongs to gangs, who rape and hold women for ransom. There are no jobs, unless you count working for the hated police force of the puppet regime, the Unified Nordic Republic of Icelanderica. UNRI lackeys ride alongside Icelandic storm troopers to point out the homes of ""terrorists,"" who are bagged, beaten and dragged off into the night, never to be seen again. Most of the victims are innocent civilians, of course, but the Icelandics don't speak English. They mistakenly trust their toadies, who use their authority to act on personal grudges.

These collaborators, as Karl Rove would point out, are fair game--for attacks by American resistance fighters. As in ""V."" And ""Red Dawn.""

A few years pass. The Icelandic government turns over nominal ""sovereignty"" to its puppet American regime, but nothing changes on the ground. The checkpoint shootings, mass arrests and chaos continue unabated. Almost everyone has lost a friend or family member to the war. There's an ""election,"" but members of the prewar Democratic and Republican parties are barred from participating. America as we know it has been rubbed out.

The humiliation is total. Icelandic forces pass out decks of cards depicting the faces of former senators, governors and generals. They shoot deposed leader George W. Bush's twin daughters and air images of their bloody, mutilated faces on state television. They print photos of Bush, haggard and obviously abused in his secret prison, wearing nothing but underwear.

Adding to the anger of patriotic Americans is the willingness of the rest of the world to forget what has happened. Other nations, including former prewar allies like Great Britain and Italy, reopen their embassies and post ambassadors to the ""new America."" The     United Nations recognizes the collaborationist regime as legitimate and meets with its appointed leader, a man unknown in America because he spent his entire life in exile in Iceland. Carpetbaggers (the collaborationist press calls them ""entrepreneurs"") pour in from abroad, scheming to line their pockets by prolonging Americans' misery and poverty. Aid groups and other NGOs seeking to help hungry and homeless Americans mean well, but their presence reinforces a sense that things are back to normal--and the collaborationist media points to their presence as tacit endorsement of the occupation.

Obviously the U.S. nationalist insurgents don't want to kill civilians. They prefer that foreigners stay out of occupied America so they can focus on driving out the Icelandics, but naive and greedy intruders ignore their warning not to associate with the puppet regime. Leaders of the resistance are forced to make a brutal choice. They can kill a few diplomats here, a few aid workers there, but since executions serve no purpose as warnings unless their horror is publicized, the American patriots choose to distribute videotapes of the killings. Similarly, they warn their countrymen not to join the collaborationist police forces. But there's only one way to ensure that the jobless won't sell out their country in order to feed their families: suicide bombers who take out as many traitors as possible.

Yes, there would be an alternative to these brutal tactics. The conquered Americans could simply accept that there will never, ever again be a land of the free and home of the brave where the United States used to be. But that would hardly be a Hollywood ending.

"event","Oh, how do I love our local power co-op - let me count the ways.  Nothing screams fun like sitting for three hours in the dark on the hottest day of the year that's turning into the hottest night of the year.  At least it was only three hours.  Three hours in which I sat knitting while my sister tried to sing all of the Spirituals that she knew.  No lie.

At least I'd sent off my application last night.  Now all I have to do is wait for them to accept me and then I can start filling out the MAT application.  Seriously, I'm about up to my neck in applications.  If they don't take me, I'll... well... I'll be quite unhappy.  You'd think it wouldn't be so hard for someone who actually WANTED to teach, but I digress.  I had a fantastic meeting with the social studies curriculum supervisor for my county - she's so incredibly nice.  And she thinks that there will more than likely be an opening for a social studies teacher in 2 years when I finish my certification.  So yay!  May have a job in a nice county and not have to go over to PG or Montgomery *shudders*  It will take a hell of a lot to make me go back to PG county.  Hell no.

And you know, I keep meaning to post my HBP thoughts - cause yeah, I know I'm a day late and a dollar short, but why not?  *lol*  Tomorrow.

And since Stacey tagged me...
<lj-cut text=""Six Song Meme"">

<i>Six songs that you are currently digging ... it doesn't matter what genre they are from, whether they have words or even if they're any good but they must be songs you're really enjoying right now. Post these instructions, the artist and the song in your LiveJournal along with your six songs. Then tag six other people to see what they're listening to.</i>

1. 'These Words' - Natasha Beddingfield  -- Beaz totally made me listen to this song when we were down for Paige's wedding.  Drove me nuts, but now I'm addicted.  I hate when that happens *lol*

2. 'Red Dirt Girl - Emmylou Harris -- It's right in my range so it's great for me to sing along to.  Kinda sad.

3. 'I Believe' - Blessid Union of Souls -- I have the acoustic version and there's just something about it that cries to be listened to over and over.

4. 'Brothers in Arms' - Dire Straits -- I rewached the 'Two Cathedrals' episode from The West Wing and this song is playing and is totally my favorite moment in television.  I never get tired of that scene.

5. 'The Kids Aren't Alright' - The Offspring -- I'm totally feeling nostalgic and this song just screams days gone by to me.  *was big fan back in the day*

6. 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' - Live 8 version with Sir Paul and U2 -- It's just frickin' catchy!  And U2 and Sir Paul are love.

"event","I started moving stuff into my new apartment yesterday.  Went and signed the paperwork, so now it's official - I HAVE to find a job down there because I'm living there *lol*  It'll be interesting, living with my sister.  We're two years apart (and I'm older, though no one ever guesses that when they meet us) and get along much better now that we're not in high school.  I never had a problem with her, but according to her I was out to 'steal all of her friends'.  Oh the joys of having a sister.  I had my own friends, thank you very much.  But I digress.

Hopefully, if everything works out, I'll be accepted to the university in October to start with the cohort in January.  Now, this is not the same situation as my ill-fated Masters that I was working on last January.  Oh no - I realized very quickly that the thing I wanted to do least in the world was public policy.  So I left, and good riddance!

Point of advice - never make statements that begin in 'I'll never...'.  They inevitably come true.  Such as 'I'll never go to a girls school.'  What did I do?  Proud graduate of a women's college.  'I'll never work in fundraising' (because that's what my dad does).  What did I do?  My work with the Congressman concerned compliance and fundraising, and I'm also the class gift agent for my college graduating class - aka, I voluntarily send out newsletters begging people to give till it feels good to the ole alma mater.  And the newest one - 'I'll never teach!'  

I'm currently applying for my Masters of Arts in Teaching.  If all goes well, I shall be teaching high school government in no time.

With this new change of focus, I have many well meaning people coming up to me 'Oh, how's your masters going?  Do you like DC?'  To which I reply 'well, I've changed my focus.  I'm going to be a teacher.'  Which is usually followed by stunned silence and either 'why the hell would you want to do that?' and 'isn't it more exciting to work in government?'

Sure, it's more exciting.  It's so exciting that you don't sleep and work 7 days a week at an average of 12 hours a day, and that's only the part that's AT the office.  People who are career civil servants, I have found - and this is merely my own experience - are generally bitter and pessimistic.  I can understand, when you've watched policies come and go and nothing gets better.  Some jackass gets elected or tapped to head your agency and tries to change what's going on, and you don't want to because what does this yokel know about the EPA that you don't?  I am by nature an optimistic person.  I am an excited person.  I also pride myself in being an openminded person and a positive person.  It's very hard to be any of those things when you work in government.  I don't want to have to form an opinion on someone just because of which box they checked on their Voter Registration card.  Democrats are not automatically good and selfless, Republicans are not automatically stupid hicks, and Green party members are not automatically holdover hippies.

I never got these impressions from the Congressman.  He was an intelligent and hardworking man.  No, I learned that I needed to judge people from his staff.  And I'm just not that type of person.  Sure, I have strong opinions.  Some very strong opinions.  But that doesn't mean that I think everyone who disagrees with me is stupid, or just out for themselves, or insert your favorite mean thing to say about the opposing party here.  The joy of America is that you can disagree with me, and please do.  But if you're going to disagree with me, back it up.  Have a reason to think the way you do, just like I do.  Disagreement isn't the worst thing to happen to people, it's ignorance.  And in today's world, there is no excuse to be ignorant.

And it's a speech like that railing against something going on on the news that caused my aunt to look at me and tell me, ""Rebecca, you should be a teacher.""  That was the first time I'd thought about it, but it makes sense.  I love sharing what I know and what I'm excited about.  I enjoyed teaching the few classes I did in undergrad.  And I think that students today don't know what's going around them, and more importantly, don't know why they should even care.  Which is a shame, because we are so interconnected now - things that happen in Britain, Sudan, the space station - all have an effect on my small little Maryland town.  And do you know why people in DC don't give a shit about young people?  Because young people <b>don't vote</b>.  If people my age would get off their asses and vote, people would care what we have to say.  But we don't care about the process, so the process doesn't care about us.

So hopefully, if I'm doing something right, they'll let me into the program and give me the chance to fire at least someone up.  Because I'm not going to go back to government until I run for office myself - right now, I'd rather show others the joy of caring.

Hopefully I won't suck at it."

Then EVERYONE here tunes into ESPN *lol*  But I've been sucked into the fannish fun because baseball is returning to Washington - and that's all that's been on the news for the past few weeks.  But today they unveiled the mascot.  The mascot had been walking around town all weekend in a giant egg costume to meet the residents before officially revealing what it was.  And today, the egg hatched :)

I think he's just precious.  And I didn't pick up on the whole egg and hatching thing until he hatched.  And most of us didn't.  A lot of people had their money on a bug named Nat (get it?  Nat... gnat... *drum riff*)  I thought it might be an eagle, either that or an Uncle Sam type figure.  But I totally didn't get the hint of the egg.  I'm a sharp one, I am.  

So pathetic, but I think Screech is even cuter than The Bird.  And I'm a fan of The Bird.  Go Nationals!  *lol*"

And I was fully planning on going this weekend, but I hate bumming around town by myself.  I need someone to chat to - or else I chat to myself and that just scares people off *lol*  Had a couple friends who were planning on coming up, but darn if it didn't fall so close to tax time.  But I wanted to go see the cherry blossoms.  Maybe this weekend I can drag someone up to go with me.

Actually, a hell of a lot cheaper than some other concerts.  And now I'm stuck trying to Ebay it to find two tickets.  $500.  And a hell of a lot of people have a hell of a lot of tickets to scalp.  Do these people not have morals?  Swiping up tickets faster than poor, poor people like me can get them on Ticketmaster and then reselling them to obviously fund purchasing a small country at the rate their going.  Where is the morality in that?  There is none.  I DESERVE to see U2.  I have earned it.  Dammit, I wrote my thesis on Bono!  Well, actually it was on Jubilee 2000 and the debt relief effort in Sub-Saharan Africa, but Bono was a good quarter of the paper!

Synopsis: ""Good To Be in DC"" is a politics-based RPG. The basic premise is that Michael Moore has dared the Washington politicians, newsmakers, journalists, etc. to participate in an open blog to prove that they are uniters, not dividers. (Since the RP's inception, it has turned out that membership is not limited to living characters. In fact, the only real limitation that has been in effect is that we've been sticking to real people.) (And Santa Claus and various deities, but that's different.)

This game is a work of parody and is not meant to represent actual people in any way. If you are one of the public figures portrayed here, please keep this in mind: Right now, there are about a hundred people thinking about you getting it on with Jeb Bush. If you take legal action, there'll be a huge media fracas and everyone in the civilized world will be thinking about you getting it on with Jeb Bush.

Such a good movie.  I'll admit - I almost cried at the end with the plane.  Almost.  I kept a little bit of my dignity.  But it really did cement the idea that Hollywood sure doesn't make movies like that anymore.  The setting was beautiful, the characters we're great, everyone was so cool... heck, there wasn't even any blood when someone got shot.  It was just... fantastic.  I'm in love with Humphrey Bogart.  Just, totally in love.  

And because I'm just that type of person, when I love a movie, I must icon.  So I figured I'd put them here if anyone was curious *lol*

Sidenote, which my mother pointed out to me.  One of the most famous lines of the movie - ""Play it again, Sam"" - is not actually in the movie.  They tell him ""Play it"" and ""Play it, Sam.  One more time."" and other variants, but never ""Play it again, Sam.""  I just thought that was interesting *lol*"

So instead of being productive, I can sit on my couch in my pjs and watch an entire season of West Wing on Bravo. I know, it's slightly pathetic, but I don't care.  Had a good weekend.  Karen, a buddy from college, came over.  It was good to see her - amazing how we can live so close to each other and never see each other.  But such is life.  We drank margaritas and played <i>Scene It! TV Edition</i>.  I would totally recommend the game for the sole reason that you realize just how much television you watch *lol*

In sad news, the father of a friend died last night.  He's been sick for a while, and he'a out of pain now.

In happy news, Lacey is going to be a Mrs.  Woohoo!  And thankfully she's thinking of wedding in winter and not spring or summer.  Lord knows that I don't need a wedding every weekend in the summer.  So yay for spreading the joy into winter.  Now I just have to start thinking of a fun gift :)"

"event","It's 3:30 am and I'm still up.  Why?  I have no idea.  This only having class three days a week tosses my sleep schedule into, well, chaos.  Because I think to myself, ""Oh, I don't have to get up!""  Bah.  No, instead I stay up making icons.  That and reading my newspapers.  I mean, I'm not pathetic - I only get 2 delivered.  Hi, my name's Rebecca, and I'm a newspaper addict.  I hardly ever watch TV news, and I only see headlines on my Yahoo! homepage.  There's nothing like the newspaper - even if most columns have turned from real reporting into thinly veiled opinion columns.  Yes, there's nothing like a newspaper.  And the best part about the Post... three pages of comics!  Three!  I didn't have three in Raleigh, but I have three here.  It's bliss.  

So I got my first paper back that I've written in this program.  The prof grades on a scale of 1-5, 1 being ""you have the writing abilities of a NERF gun, why did they let you into this program?"" to 5 being ""here you can have my job"".  He very rarely gives out 5s to a 4.5 is happy dance quality.  And what did I get?  Oh yeah, 4.5.  I definately had to restrain myself from doing my happy dance in the classroom.  That and we had to present our memo topics (I'm doing No Child Left Behind and the, um, disputes around it.  Have to try very hard not to let personal opinion in.)  He said it sounded like I knew what I was talking about.  I didn't tell him I was just repeating what the education doctoral students said in my Education Policy class.  Hey, I'm studying government, we're supposed to theif things like that.  But!  To those who were with me in college - the succinct, brief writing style that drove Dr. Taylor crazy is what's going to let me do well in policy writing.  Mwahahaha!  It's such a satisfying feeling to know that I was right.  So right.

And now I can see that my talk is quickly turning into babble.  Deteriorating even.  I should go to bed.  Yes, bed.  Goodnight."

A friend of mine works there, so I went with her to see American Ballet Theater present <i>Swan Lake</i>.  I'm not a huge fan of ballet, but ABT is the premire company in the US and in the top five in the world, so if anyone's going to put on an enjoyable production, these guys are.  And they were fantastic.  The girl who danced Odette... I have no idea how people jump up at such angles and still land on their feet.  But it was beautiful.

But the best part was getting to see all the behind-the-scenes areas with my friend.  After the show she took me backstage and we got to see all the dancers undressing and taking off their makeup, we got to see the set broken down and the leftovers from some of the opera sets (ABT was performing in the Opera House)... it was all so neat.

And luckily her boyfriend isn't a ballet fan so hopefully I'll get to go with her more often *lol*

And now I really don't want to do my reading for class tomorrow... *looks for distractions*"

So I get my lovely Verizon cd and realize ""oh, I need to switch out my disk drive for my cd drive so I can install my lovely DSL"".  So, I do.  When I turn my computer back on - blue screen of death.  ""Fatal System Error"".  So I freak out and end up spending 5 hours and two Dell Techies trying to fix my computer so that Windows will open.  I take a break to order pizza.  The Papa John's girl... this is obviously a new one on her.  Although I can't imagine why.  I call the College Papa John's.  
PJs: ""So, you're on campus?""  
Me: ""No, I'm in *this neighboring town* but you deliver here.""  
Pjs: ""Um.... I don't think we deliver there.""
Me: ""Um, yes you do.  I've seen your car here.  You deliver here.""
PJs: ""Uh.... let me get my manager.""

Then it turns out that the coupon I wanted to use 'wasn't in their system' after they tried to convince me it was void.  Nope, not until 2/15.  But I digress.  I did get my pizza btw.

So I pop in the Verizon cd to load up my DSL and it stalls - for an hour - at the final step.  Had to call Verizon Tech Support to get around it.  Very nice guy.  Thought I was my mother.  Kept calilng me Mrs.  And from the sound of his voice he couldn't have been any older than I am.  Oh well, he had a cute voice. *lol*

But after starting the debacle at 4:30 I finally had internet at 10:30 that night.  I'm never shutting off my computer again - I have decided.  

Alright, off to clean the apartment.  The father is coming over to go to the Maryland/Duke game.  Go Terps. :)"

"event","So I spent the first part of the week moving into my new apartment.  I have a couch and a bed and everything is moving along quite nicely :)  Went up on Tuesday with Mom and got everything all put together.  The plan was to spend the night and then come back Wednesday morning.  I plugged in my TV in the hopes of finding a station or two through antenna (since I haven't sold my soul to Comcast... yet).  Luck of luck, NBC 4 came through pretty well, as well as ABC 7.  Good ole Washington stations, I knew I could depend on you!  Watch the news, and inbetween the two highlight stories of the day - Bush's gazillion-dollar party and Trump's gazillion-dollar party, the weather.  DC Metro area was going to get an inch or so afternoon of Wednesday.  ""No problem,"" we say.  ""We'll be out of town in no time!""

So Wednesday morning we go to IKEA for a quick romp to see if there's a sofa picture I like.  We're in no more than 30 minutes, it's 10:30am and we walk outside.

We got dumped on.  Much earlier than expected.  So, we crawl in the car back through campus to get to my apartment and camp out there.  Snow comes down all day.  Now, this would not be a problem usually.  This happens in Maryland this time of year.  But, it came up much quicker and faster than the snow trucks were ready for, and me not thinking that I was even going to BE there for this, hadn't put the ice scraper or the chains or anything in the car yet.  Goody.  So, we're stuck at my apartment.  Hadn't gone to the grocery store yet.  Noooo.  Had peanut butter and Zesta crackers for three square meals.  The two stations we got went fuzzy.  Got real cold.  I contemplated walking to <lj user=acting_indigo>'s apartment because her roommates would be entertainment, but alas it was too far and I had no snowboots with me.  Or my sled... I could've really used my sled.

Anyway, long story short - well, not really - didn't get to come home till Thursday.  Internet was down all Thursday.  And the weather report for tomorrow is 4-8"" of snow here on the shore and I think just as much in the Metro area.  So, I just have to be back up there by the time classes start on Wednesday.  Actually, I need to pick up my books and a parking spot so I need Tuesday.  I'll just hitch up my huskies and mush down the Beltway.  That'll be a sight."

All men and women
Living on the Earth
Ties of hope and love
Sister and brotherhood
That we are bound together
In our desire to see the world become
A place in which our children
Can grow free and strong
We are bound together
By the task that stands before us
And the road that lies ahead
We are bound and we are bound

There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist
There is a hunger in the center of the chest
There is a passage through the darkness and the mist
And though the body sleeps the heart will never rest

Shed a little light, oh Lord
So that we can see
Just a little light, oh Lord
Wanna stand it on up
Stand it on up, oh Lord
Wanna walk it on down
Shed a little light, oh Lord

Can't get no light from the dollar bill
Don't give me no light from a TV screen
When I open my eyes
I wanna drink my fill
From the well on the hill

There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist
There is a hunger in the center of the chest
There is a passage through the darkness and the mist
And though the body sleeps the heart will never rest

Oh, Let us turn our thoughts today
To Martin Luther King
And recognize that there are ties between us
All men and women
Living on the Earth
Ties of hope and love
Sister and brotherhood"

"event","I just finished reading an absolutely hilarious book.  <i>The Stupidest Angel</i> by Christopher Moore.  To give you a certain taste of what type of funny this is, I give you a paragraph from the first chapter...

""In another Christmas story, Dale Pearson, evil developer, self-absorbed woman hater, and seemingly unredeemable curmudgeon, might be visted in the night by a series of ghosts who, by showing him bleak visions of Christmas past, present, and future, would bring about in him a change to generosity, kindness, and a general warmth toward his fellow man.  But this is not that kind of Christmas story, so here, in not too many pages, someone is going to dispatch the miserable son of a bitch with a shovel.  That's the Christmas yet to come in these parts.  Ho, ho, ho.""

That mixed with the undead's love for ""affordable prefab furniture"" and shouts of ""first we feast, then IKEA!"" it's just such a wonderful book.  I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a laugh.

Speaking of IKEA, I had my first experience of one on Monday.  I have an apartment, but no furniture to speak of so, since there is an IKEA in College Park, my mother and I went.  Well... for those who have never been in an IKEA, it is not an experience - it's an ADVENTURE!  City blocks of furniture arranged by spot in the house and made into pretty room decors - that even give you the squarefootage of the preview spaces that you walk through to get a sense of how it would fit into your house, half of the information in Swedish, a deli/cafeteria to eat so you don't have to leave the store, a place to check in your kids so you don't have to lug them around with you.

And then, the warehouse.  I didn't know that it all came in a box that you had to assemble yourself.  You find the number on the piece you want, go down to the warehouse and then, like a Home Depot on crack, you try to find your piece.  Five or six large shelves high... boxes of chairs, dressers, tables, beds... it's beyond mind boggling.  And there was the dresser I loved - in two flat boxes just daring me to try and put it together.  Lovely stuff, but God knows if I'm handy enough to put it together.

But I found a couch with a name I can't pronounce and in a lovely seafoam green that will add much needed color to my very beige apartment.  Very beige."

Today's story is <a href=""http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1802&ncid=1802&e=1&u=/washpost/20050111/ts_washpost/a63896_2005jan10"">U.S. Tells D.C. to Pay Inaugural Expenses</a>.

(excerpt)
D.C. officials said yesterday that the Bush administration is refusing to reimburse the District for most of the costs associated with next week's inauguration, breaking with precedent and forcing the city to divert $11.9 million from homeland security projects.

...""It's an unfunded mandate of the most odious kind. How can the District be asked to take funds from important homeland security projects to pay for this instead?"" said Davis spokesman David Marin. 

The region has earmarked federal homeland security funds for such priorities as increasing hospital capacity, equipping firefighters with protective gear and building transit system command centers.(end)

I mean, c'mon.  That's just ridiculous.  ""Hey DC, you don't get any representation in the government, no one who actually <i>lives</i> in DC will get to go to one of the events, but hey, you pay for it.  Don't reinforce Dulles or National, don't train police personnel in disaster relief, don't help stock local hospitals in preparation for the next terrorist attack... use that money to pay for our party."" 

If I was Mayor Williams, I would tell the administration that, I'm sorry, but that's just not acceptable.  ""I'm sorry, Mr. President, but we spent a good chunk of our discretionary income on purchasing a baseball team.  The money you're trying to weasel from us is already earmarked, so I'm afraid we won't be able to host the inaguration.  I'm sure that Maryland or Virginia would be more than happy to foot your bill... and if not, try Oregon or Guam.  But I'm afraid that the District can't afford your party.  Try again in 2008, if you have the money.""

And I would pay good money to see the faces of the administration if Williams told them 'no'.  Because what are they going to do?  Send in the Guard to take over DC and FORCE them to pay for the party?  No, they'd have to pony up the cash.  Arg, makes my blood boil.

(Apologies to anyone who doesn't find this <i>nearly</i> as interesting as I do.  The Washington stations are all over it, and since that's what we get here...)"

I don't think I can begin to describe how good it is to be home.

"event","Well, I gave myself a day to let it sink in. My candidate won reelection to his 9th term in Congress (yay!) and, well, I'm sure that anyone who knows me can figure out how I feel about the presidential.  But, there's too much vitrol out there as it is, so I'm not going to add mine to it.  Anyone who wants to know can ask, but I'm sure I'd just echo other sentiments out there.

On another but related note!  There was an editorial in the Raleigh News & Observer yesterday that captures how I feel about the mudslinging vitrol that has become politics today.  Luckily, my boss was one of the ones mentioned as one who 'kept it clean' - something that the Congressman is very proud of.  So, I thought I would share the article and point out who my boss is.

<b>Election a shame ... literally</b>

By DENNIS ROGERS, Staff Writer, Raleigh News & Observer

I have a few questions for the election winners who slashed and burned their way to victory: Was it worth it?

<lj-cut text=""Election a shame... literally..."">
When you looked into the mirror this morning, did you feel at least a twinge of shame? Or have you scurried so far down the political rathole that you can excuse your negative attack ads as just the way things are in politics nowadays?

Was winning worth the loss of your dignity? 

Not every candidate resorted to name-calling and character assassination. Lt. Gov. Beverly Perdue, <b>U.S. Rep. David Price</b>, U.S. Rep. Bob Etheridge and Secretary of State Elaine Marshall all ran comparatively informative campaigns. Their upbeat TV commercials were a relief from the stench wafting from so many other races.

Am I the only one who thinks all of you who resorted to negative attack ads should be run out of town? If half of the things you said about each other are true, none of you is worthy to govern us. Are you really so self-centered that you believe the public is better off because you convinced voters your opponent is evil?

Things are dicey in our country right now. We're at war, and soldiers -- some of them our neighbors -- are dying. Our economy is still struggling, and so are those at the bottom of the pay scale. Some Americans may die this winter because there is not enough vaccine to protect them from the flu.

We needed statesmen in these perilous times. Instead, we got political thuggery. We needed inspiration to boost our morale. Instead, we got candidates from both parties willing to destroy our faith in the decency of our system and in those who participate in it just so they could win.

We needed someone to believe in. Instead, we got you.

I plead guilty to being a naive and misty-eyed idealist. Perhaps politics has become a full- contact sport. Perhaps negative campaigning always works.

I don't believe that. What this kind of campaign bloodletting does is ensure that the candidate with the most money almost always wins. It also makes it less likely that honorable men and women will dare go into politics in the future. Why should they? Why should any decent person be willing to sacrifice himself or herself in the free-fire zone that is politics today?

Whatever happened to the noble tradition of offering yourself for public office because you wanted to serve your neighbors? Now it seems to be about winning for the sake of winning, consequences and reputations be damned.

You winners now have the power to govern us, but the cost of your victories was dear. Your moral authority is tarnished. You have left a disheartened, angry and confused electorate in your wake. Our once sustaining faith in the goodness of our system and in those who engage in it is in tatters. Nice going.

It didn't have to be this way. You could have taken the high road. You could have given us hope. You could have moved us to action with your vision of what we could become if we united behind your leadership.

Instead, you have insulted our intelligence and turned us against each other for your own glory. We are bitterly divided today, and that is your fault. It is also your greatest sin.

Good luck, winners. You're going to need it.

And so will all of us."

"event","So, I get to work this morning, and everyone's in a tizzy over <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/anniesj/331112.html"">this post</a>.  Found it through <lj user=""narcissam"">'s journal and thought ""ooh, something other than fandom wars... let's take a look!"".  So, quick summary.  Someone made 'threatening' comments about Bush on her LJ, someone reported her to the FBI, Secret Service checks her out, now she's on file with the government from now until eternity.  I think that's a pretty good summary.

<lj-cut text=""And now, for the rant"">

First off, I'm a big defender of the Freedom of Speech.  You have the right to say what you will.  And honestly, the person who reported her... well, that's surprising to me because it didn't seem like there was anything terribly threating about what she said.

But on the other hand, I'm glad that the Secret Service <i>did their job</i> and investigated her.  That's one of the main purposes of the Secret Service, to protect the office of the Presidency.  I'm glad that they didn't just brush it off as something silly, but really looked into it.  That doesn't make me feel worse, it makes me feel better about it.  It's their job.  And I'm damn glad their doing their job.  

And another thing.  People are upset about the realization that this will get you an FBI file.  Seriously people, an FBI file is not the end of the world.  Most people have them anyway.  If you've ever held any government (municipal, state, or federal) employment, you have an FBI file.  If you've ever been arrested, you have an FBI file.  If you've ever been the leader of a vocal protest group, you have an FBI file.  This was happening before the Patriot Act and will happen a long time after the Patriot Act is repealed.  

Yes, she may get put on the no-fly list.  That doesn't mean she can't fly - it just means she's going to be watched when she does.  Hell, I'm sure that they watch me because the last time I flew, I forgot to take my pocket knife off of my key chain and went through that whole debaucle.  

I don't even know if there's a point to me saying this whole shpeal... but, the Secret Service was just doing their job.  And I for one am glad that they do."

You know, she makes all sorts of asides and comments about this and that that I try very hard to ignore.  Like how she said that she couldn't fathom how religious people - especially Baptists - could be Democrats.  The Congressman is a Baptist - he got his BA in Divinity.  I'm a Baptist and I like to think of myself as a spiritual person.  But I let it slide.  She obviously is just an angry person.

And all sorts of other little things like that, degrading anyone who didn't fit into her perfect little world.

And now the new one - 'You can always tell a college-educated woman because she listens to NPR, and not that Today Show/Goodmorning America/didn't go to college, stay at home and keep getting pregnant moms...'

I wanted to reach over my desk and slap her.  Not only do I not appreciate the snarkyness against the stay at home mothers (of which I was very thankful that my mother was one, and I dare anyone to call my mother stupid)  But I also have to stand up and say that I am a College Educated Woman... and I do NOT listen to NPR.  That's right, no NPR for me.  Give me the Today Show or Good Morning America.  Bring on Matt Lauer and Charlie Gibson.  I respect NPR for what service it provides, but I would rather bore a hole in my head than listen to talk radio.  But that's just me.  And that's the glory of it - you can do WHAT YOU WANT.

With all the talk of 'freedom on the march' in the world, it's sobering to think about how lucky most of us are to not have to face this kind of... opression.  So, it's from the <a href=""http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041014/OPINION03/410140367/1035/OPINION"">Des Moines Register</a>.  Thought I'd throw it out.

<b>Saudi women deserve to vote</b>

By REGISTER EDITORIAL BOARD

October 14, 2004 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
President Bush has used freedom as justification for the Iraq war in recent days. So it's especially troubling that Saudi Arabia - home of 15 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers - announced Monday that women can neither vote nor run for office in the country's first nationwide election. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell failed to condemn the Saudi government when he said women should be given the right to vote, but this right would ""have to come in due course.""

Yet most people would agree that freedom is an important step in battling terrorism. Saudi Arabia has been called upon to work for political and social change. The 2005 national election is part of that effort, but doesn't go far enough.

Where women are not treated equally, there is no freedom.

The lack of voting rights is troubling, but that is just one way women are oppressed in Saudi Arabia. Females cannot go to school, travel or work without permission from a male guardian or husband. They cannot drive. They must cover themselves to leave the house. Worse, some Saudi women don't think they should be given the right to vote, reported the Associated Press. ""We have so little interaction with men that we will vote with our emotions, choosing candidates for their looks and sweet talk rather than for what they can deliver,"" said one woman.

Other women, however, were upset by the government's decision and said voting should be their right. A few women had even announced they planned to run for office.

Let's summarize the irony here. The United States wants to put freedom on the march in the Arab world. But in few places are women treated with less dignity than in Saudi Arabia, our avowed ally in the war on terror.

The decision of the Saudi government to deny rights to people based on gender is wrong. The United States should stand up - for all the world to see - for freedom in Saudi Arabia, too."

I thought about it last year but never had time - what with my thesis and all - and this year maybe it would be cathartic to write 50k of crap venting about my job *lol*.  Changing it into fiction of course.  So I've decided it will be me and my job, but with ray guns.  And explosions.  And the good guys (namely me) winning out over the bad guys (namely the campaign manager).  Mwahahaha.

I also feel very official - I finally got around to registering my Maryland email account.  So hopefully I will find out when to register for classes and get all grad student-fied. :)"

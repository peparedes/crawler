"event","Yep... I am happy ... and then reality BITCH SLAPS me...

FACTS:
- Joe doesnt want to persue a relationship because of the distance.
- I am a ""good friend"" 
- I am falling hard for Joe
- He is going away for THREE weeks now in April
- I have a month until the FE, two until graduation.

REFLECTION:
- The odds that I see Joe often enough to build something between now and graduation... not very good
- Odds that I move to Central NY ... not very good
- Odds that Joe and I will ever be more than friends... not very good
- I was stupid enough to hope that something would happen...

CONCLUSION:
I am going to probably get hurt, thanks to my constant drive to be happy, which always leads me into moving without the consent of who ever else is involved.  So, instead I am going to begin to dissassociate myself -  not that I want to - because I think things could be great - but because I dont want to be a mess after graduation.

So once again I am off... gotta love how life changes from one day to the next..."

"event","Well I have finally taken time to write in this... seems that people are actually reading it and are now missing the latest chapter in my life.  Well as you may have guessed Steve and I are only friends - as are Adam and I.  Nothing more - nothing more desired or requested.  I dont want to talk about them... things are rocky in both relationships - and I dont want to have to deal with it if i dont have to...

There is actually a new person that knows how to play my heart strings - Joe.  He is a cadet in the Police Academy.  It is odd - I have only known him for a few weeks, but already he can cheer me up and make me smile unlike anyone else.  He has two amazing kitties - and this is from the one that is allergic to cats.  Gizmo and Buster are a-okay in my book... the only cats I ever cared for...

We have only met once - but thanks to the technology of webcam and messanger - I get to see him when he gets home, and he gets to see me when I walk throught the door.  It is odd, but nice, how much he is learning about me by just watching my facial expressions and the way i naturally react when i dont realize that someone is looking [i often forget the webcam is on...]

I dont know what will happen between us, but I am just taking things one step at a time.  This might be worth the time and effort - actually i already think it is...  It is going to be hard to move back home... no broadband... webcam in family kitchen... but i dont want to think of that now.

Graduation occurs in a few weeks, but i am not stressing over it... what happens happens...  As for now, I just want to spend my spring break studying for the FE, talking to Joe, and enjoying the silence.  Until March 20th, there is nothing that can worry me... I am happy.

I am happy.

I havent said that and truthfully meant it in so long... but now i can smile for no reason and I have a little bounce in my step again.  I am actually happy - and I wont let anyone take that away from me.  

Alot said in a short amount of time - but then - I dont have to explain anything to anyone that I dont want to... and the person I will explain everything to will ask when he is ready."

"event","Well today went well.  I love my Planning and Design group - I think all will be good.  

After class, I hung out for a bit with the twins - they are so awsome... I have to get closer to them before I leave! I then went to finish my section of the GIS lab, and then went down to the WPE wing.  It was great!  I got to see all my guys, and got to actually hang out with them.  I didnt realize how much I missed them.  We all hung out, did some talking, cleared the air, and did everything and nothing all at the same time.  

I then got a ride home with Michalia and ordered Chinese food.  Just as I was about to relax, I got a knock at the door and got a great surprise!  Adam stopped by to say hi and hang out.  I couldnt have loved it more!  Things went well and after he finally left, Michalia and I made butterscotch rice krispy treats.  They were SOOOOOO goood!  

I am actually really happy right now.  Life is good, and who would have known I just had to stop wanting and everything would come to me!"

"event","Well it is my final semester, and a lot has happened already.  It is now one week into the semester, and each of my respective best friends are keeping their distance.  I know that they will probably read this, but I am going to be honest... I can't bullshit the world anymore.

Ok - I spent Christmas break pending if I should be open with everything that happened last semester. I am going to be vague for this, if you were involved, you know what happened.  Things happened and I spent the whole break, well almost the whole break, worrying about what would happen when we all returned to Syracuse.  I came clean with Steve and told him all things that happened.  We argued, I cried, and some how we didn't kill each other.  However, he was highly disappointed in me, and claimed not to respect me anymore - which was expected.

When I arrived in Syracuse, I met my other friend, and things were great.  At the end of last semester, things were awkward because I never knew what he was thinking.  The first day was great, I missed hanging out with him so much.  When I asked him to come over the next day because I wanted to know where things stood, I was told that it might be best to add distance between us.  But however if it were two years later, he would date me in a heartbeat.  This hurt more than anything, but I wasnt going to let him know that.  I stuck out my chin and agreed.  That is until I kinda freaked out in his car later that night... yeah... yelled at him to get over it and not to leave the chance for regret.  Nothing more was said.

The next day Steve came to Syracuse, and everything was great.  I really missed hanging out with him.  Things were perfect - too perfect.  All was well until I saw the healing hickey on his neck... yeah.  When I asked what that was, he said he hoped I wouldnt see it.  He had apparently hooked back up with his ex-girlfriend, which also just happened to be his first love.  She has also not dated anyone since him.... FIVE YEARS LATER! So she is waiting for him... and he has a little hoover to suck whatever he needs....

OK - that was mean... but I am bitter.  How did I lose control over everything?  So things are interesting... her picture replaces mine and I no longer can talk with my two best friends.  Well my other best friend called, wanting to hang out, but Steve got snowed in and he couldnt come over.  This did not help the situation.  In fact it pushed him away even more.  And to think my night went from fun and relaxing to reading text messages between the two rekindling childhood sweethearts.  

Yeah - this is death to a chick.  I will always be jealous over both of them, but I am only so strong... thus resulting in my bitch attack this week.  

Classes started, and they are alot of work, but I love them.  I miss seeing my guys - I didnt realize how much they kept me sane last semester.  I really hate not seeing them  and hanging out in the conference room.  So instead I go home, watch cooking shows, and do homework.  Life is good :-/  

We planned to go out on Thursday, but I was frustrated and said some things I probably shouldnt have - but what can you do?  I miss having some one there to tell me that they enjoy my company and just like to hang out with me.  Nothing sexual, just a good friend.  Anytime I talk to them, things are weird.  Well you live and learn - and sometimes get hurt in the process.  

This weekend was great - girls movie weekend.  Alexis and I watched movies and Desperate Housewives.  It was everything I needed... but it didnt replace my missing guys. 

Today I got a message from Steve telling me that his ex and a friend were coming to visit him for a few days.  Yeah I know that there is not enough room in his place for both of them, so he will probably bunk with her tonight.  Yeah... not a comforting though.  But I did alot of thinking.  I am not jealous because I want him back.  He is not the same person I fell in love with before.  I dont want my other best friend in that way either, I just want everything to go back to movie night and big hugs and late nights in 166 Baker with the guys. 

There are alot of things on my mind, and I honestly have no one to talk to.  It hurts, but I seem to always spend my senior years (high school and college) alone.   Maybe it is preparing me for leaving.  All I know is that my best friend has to be myself, and no one else.  I just wish I had someone to tell me that they will take me through the thick and thin, and will hug me when I cry, and slap me when I pout.  Someone to eat ice cream with and watch movies.  Someone to throw snowballs with, and drink hot cocoa with afterwards.  Someone to go to basketball games with and go to Thursday Darwins with.  I know this is alot to ask, so I expect nothing.  I am giving up... and it sucks.

Now dont look at me with pity or anything - I brought this on myself.  And now it is time to face the music ... alone."

"event","Well hello all... 

Reporting from the NYC... and missing the cuse.  Well it has been a while, alot to tell, alot that has happened since my last report, but even that did not say much.  

Well to catch up, the past few weeks have been kewl. I owe the guys alot, they are everything I need them to be.  I really love those guys! Alot of self discovery and even some excessive free drinking... yeah i know... got yelled at alot for that.  But hey gotta do it at least once.  But dont worry, I was burping Crown Royal for a few days (three shots will do that) and I never wanna touch the stuff again. (Again thanks guys... I wont be at your house nearly as much next semester!)

On the note of me and Steve, we are great friends again.  I love him lots, but we are not ready yet to be anything more than laundry and Wendy late night run friends.  I hope that things will become clearer next semester.

On the note of me and Adam, he is the official best friend any girl can ask for.  He is there when I need him to be, even if that ends up clouding up the relationship between me and steve.  But he is one friend that I will never lose.  We may lose touch but we will always be friends.  But again I will worry about that at a later time.  

On the note of the crazy NYC family, they are still big and loud.  I didnt realize how much my life resembled big fat greek wedding... no joke.  This is dead serious. I dont wanna think of a wedding.. christmas is enough for now.....   

On the note of grades this semester, I currently have a 2.7 GPA: 2 C+ and 2 A-, and all I am missing is soils.  That should be an A for all those that dont refer to me as the curve blower or as the soils queen.  (YEAH... I am a dork... I love those names!!!)  I aim to have at least a 3.0 this semester!

Well, that is all I can think of right now.  More to come... that is if I give you permission to read it~ ;-)

Happy holidays to all, See you in 2005!"

Well first of all, as of tonight, I am completly done with all of my TA work.  I am going to really miss the class.  They were a great group that worked hard.  They even signed a card and collected $ to give to me, as a thank you.  They are the best class ever...

Second, I have made the best friends in the world.  And they are not FEGs... yes I am talking about my WPE guys.  They are all a girl could want: joking when I need to laugh, helpful when I am confused, comforting when I need a hug, and protection when I get in trouble ;-)  They are everything a girl needs.

Well this is also finals week.  Today I had two exams and I have to finish my design by tomorrow morning.  So on that note I will finish this entry tomorrow morning!"

"event","Well as many of you have assumed just by my personality and such, a lot has changed over the past few months.  There have been a few big changes, and below are little dittys on how each are going:

December Graduation - Ok... this is going to suck.  I am losing my best friend, Meeche, and alot of my other friends: Joe, Vinni, and a few others... I think I might be crying more than anyone... this is really going to suck... but I wish them all the best and I will miss them greatly.  

Steve and I - Well as you know, we are no longer together.  No break, No nothing.  He told me that I treated him like a doormat, and therefore  would like it if I did not speak to him until he contacts me that he is ready.  However, I am to be here to comfort him in his times of need... yeah... 'nough said...

Adam and I - Many of the guys joke, and Meeche you know too well.  I am sorry for anyone that doesnt know, but I have a new friend Adam.  We are not boyfriend/girlfriend, nor can I see that ever happening.  We are just friends that like to spend time with each other and have mutual respect for each of us.  

The FEG / WPE conflict - I think this going the best of all of the above.  I am an honorary WPE, and I like hanging out with the guys.  It kinda felt like Romeo and Juliet, kinda being shunned by each respective side.  But things are going well.  Adam even came to the FEG Thanksgiving dinner and was well welcomed and accepted.

Thanksgiving dinner - It went fantastic.  Great big thanks and congrats to Craig for cooking an AMAZING turkey, and to everyone that pitched in.  It was the first year that I didnt cook anything.  It was good times!

The guys - This kinda goes tied with the FEG/WPE conflict.  I love the guys! They are the best ever.  Even when fun ends with broken windows and shots of whiskey, I have the best times and alot of fun. 

Graduation - Well it is 173 days until graduation.  That is scary, but I am really excited about it!  Graduation, then getting my own apartment.  Getting a job, picking out dining room sets.  All for MY house, MY apartment... this is going to be great.  No one can take me down from this high!

Well that is pretty much all that is happening in the ""Life of Liz"".  Throughout it all I am happy and finally content with my life and with the choices I have made.  It has not been easy, but I am happy... and no one can take that away from me."

"event","Well it has been a while since I last wrote.  A lot has happened, some good and some bad.  Steve and I broke up, but we are remaining friends.  I think it will be good.  

I saw a website that I think everyone that hates the south right now should read.  Go to http://www.fuckthesouth.com/  it is really funny.

Well I am kinda numb about everything.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I think I will be better once I see my friends and get yelled at for being an insensitive naive ass.... but it actually might make me feel better.  Steve is not yelling at me, so i feel the need to get yelled at from someone.  It kinda sucks that he is being so understanding.  It makes me feel even more like shit.  

But I do know, however, that when his mother finds out I will become a bitch that is hated and resume the fucked up position of ex-girlfriend.  I just hope that the promise of staying friends will actually last.  I think I might be out of friends when they find out that the perfect couple is on a break.  I say break because I think that there is too much invested in us to give up all together.

But I don't know until tomorrow.  Until then all I can do is study and do homework and wait.  The shit will hit the fan eventually....

If you are a joint friend of ours, please don't hate me.  Yell at me and call me names, but still be my friend... I think I will need a friend to rely on.  But if you decide not to, I understand.  I think I will understand more than you can imagine."

"event","Ahhh.... these past couple of weeks have been tiring but also has given me a boost that will let me complete the semester with a smile on my face.  I have great friends that are the best.  I love all of you guys, and appreciate the hugs and shoulders to lean on that you guys have given me.  

I have completed a couple of those personality quizzes that people love to send me, so here are some of my results:

"event","Well I have come to the realization that there is only 6 months left to my collegiate career.  And the part that hurts even more is the fact that I will probably only keep in touch with a couple of people.  After all the people I have met throughout the years, only a couple are sincere and have become true friends.  

These two people know who they are, and they know that they are indespensible to me.  And I will be forever greatful to them for all the laughter and tears, studying and partying, and all the times where we did nothing at all.  Those are the times that will make my memories.  To all others, I will wish you the best but in all honesty, it will be a surprise to me to hear from you.

I would love to be proven wrong in this aspect, but I wont bet the farm on a bet I am not confident in.  

6 months left.... 206 days exactly..."

"event","Well, it has taken 5 years to happen.  I have gone out on a weeknight, a Wednesday, for Flip Night.  It wasn't overwhelming or life changing.  Or maybe it is... Either way I had more fun than I have in a long time.

This is actually becoming an issue to the one that I love.  Steve seems to think the guy I have become friends with may be a threat to our relationship.  This is funny since it wasn't an issue for the years we were at school together, but now it is something that is truly bothering him.  And yet I refuse to say that I am sorry.  It feels good to have a friend that doesn't see me as Steve's girlfriend or as one half of the ""cute couple"".  I am seen as my own person.  Being liked for being me.  It is different, and nice.  I like the fact that I can tell my teenage daughter or son in 20 years that I went partying and can understand what they are going through. I like the fact that I can never say that I regret missing opportunities in college, because I never knew how to party. 

I do not regret the four years of work and lack of partying... but now it is my last year.  My last opportunity to have fun and be carefree.  I wanna leave my hair down and just be everything that I know I have honestly suppressed for the past 4 years.  I want to be adventurous and maybe even a little wild and unpredictable.  And I want to take that opportunity and experience things that I otherwise would have missed.  I enjoy hanging out with people other than the ones that I attend class with.  It is a new way of thinking.  

I lost my planner this week, which when it should have devastated me (which it did when I thought about it), I was completely laid back and carefree all of the other times.  It was nice. Different.  

I want to be able to be carefree and irresponsible.  I found this and thought it was perfect:  

I want to be a kid, just for one day again. I want to be irresponsible and wild. I want to leave life behind just for one day. I want to romp in a playground, picnic at the park and play tag. 

Anyone want to join me?


This is what I want.  I am 22, not married, and have only six months before life slaps me in the face.  I am not saying that I want to do every guy in the bar, all I  want to do is have fun and be carefree while I still can.  Is that so wrong to ask?

Well this weekend, we will not be partying.  We will be hanging out and being FEG's, tame and casual.  But next weekend, the vixen will come out!"

"event","I just got back to syracuse around 4:15 from a great weekend to watch the Jets game and eat pizza and wings with my hunny.  I wont see him now for another two weeks, all because Syracuse no longer gives us Columbus day off.  He is going home to attend his grandparent's anniversary party.

This weekend we went apple picking and watched movies.  It was so simple that it was perfect.  Which makes me a little sad that i wont see him for two weeks.....

Well I have to keep this short due to the never ending pile of homework and large number of exams next week."

"event","Well, it is a beautiful Friday and I am actually happy!  

Things are going well, had a nice lunch with Charles and Larissa.  Things are good.

For those that dont know me all that well, I am a senior forest engingeering student at SUNY ESF in Syracuse NY.  I am originally from NYC, born and raised.  I like to chat, watch Law and Order, design  stormwater systems (yes it actually becoming a hobby) and hang out with my boyfriend.

I have been dating Steve for over a year now, and things are going well.  He goes to Cornell now, so I spend a good amount of time in Ithaca.  Who ever said Syracuse is the town of hills apparently never went to Ithaca.  

I am the oldest of five children, the younger ones ranging from 10 - 14 in age.  My twin baby brothers are my hearts, and they know I am wrapped around their little fingers.  My sisters, 14 and 13, are more like little daughters to me, I am waaayyyy to overprotective.  I am waiting for the first guy to break their hearts, and then I will break their legs... j/k .... maybe....

My mom is a single parent, and has actually become my best friend since I started college.  Who would have guessed that the best thing for our relationship was to add distance to the equation....  I actually enjoy talking to her every night about our days.  I guess she lives the life she never had through me and I still get a piece of home given to me every day.  Its nice.

In Syracuse, I live by myself and love every minute of it.  Its not that I am not a people person, I just cant stand the awkwardness of always seeing the same person.  

Oh wells, it is time to get other stuff done. 

Good weekend all!"

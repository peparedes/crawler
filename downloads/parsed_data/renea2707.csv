"event","well a couple days rocky asked me out. well at the time i thought i still wanted chris back. so i told rocky no. well on that monday i was in school and people all came up to me and there like rocky is getting terminated right now. so i started freaking out. so i went down to C.S.O. and i told them i was going out with him so i wanted to talk to him before he left. so they let me. they wouldnt let me sit with him so i was like yelling. lol not really. but i asked if i could hug him and they said no. so when he was walking off he all put his hand on my head and i started crying. i wrote him a  note and like some one told me that rocky called me in class but then i tryed to call him and his # was not working so i dont know what the fuck is going on right now. but im going to eat bye

P.S.
i still like chris a lil even though he is rude to me...."

"event","well today it was ok i didnt talk to rocky  about anything or chris about anything but that i think me and him are just going to be friend but i dont know.  I GOT MY LICENSE TODAY. im happy about that. and im a lil sick but anyways... i talk to walter and he was all telling me that rocky likes me and hes going to ask me out tomorrow but i dont know if i want a bf cuz i know for a fact that i will get hurt in the end. even though me and chris were not together very long and i broke up with him i still miss him alot. but he likes another girl. man i talk to my dad and i was asking about the car and he is being a bitch about it. i guess he thinks that im going to get in a wreck or something i dont know. he needs to trust me. its a good thing that my mom does. oh about my mom she told me something today and it kinda made me feel bad. she told me she was going to sell everything and move to indiana. knowing that i wont get to see her for like a yr. and i cant live without my mom. i wanna cry just thinking that she would be gone for a week. i love my mom so much. and if she moves then well i dont know ill prolly cry then get over it.. i think.. i just dont want her to leave me. everyone is leaving me right about now. everyone but chelsea. i love hanging out with her. she always has something good to say to me. and her bf is being a ass to her and i like owen but i love chelsea so i dont think its right for him to do that. plus hes talking well not talking more like ""walking"" with a nasty UGLY bitch. and i swear if he does ANYTHING and i mean ANYTHING with her i will never talk to him again. but i just took some pills and i think that im going to take a shower and go to bed... bye"

"event","well last night me and rocky got back together. chris was pissed off at first but then he realized he didnt like me. so i was happy about that. cuz i didnt want anything to happen to rocky. i love him so much its not even funny. i didnt want him to stop holding me last night it felt so good. and the best thing about it all is that chelsea is there for me the whole way. and its hard to find some one to care alot about you and i love her and i know she cares about me she shows it all the time. and chelsea when you read this i want you to know i love you and your a really good friend and i dont know what i would do up here without you. :)... but im going to get off here bye"

"event","I put things inside me, only to revel in the delight of removing them. I'm wolfing down this mountain of food, only to crawl to the bathroom minutes later to get_it_all_out. Get it out. Get it out. Get it out of me. 
I only ever cut my wrists and my elbows because I want to see the blood coming out of me. I force more and more out until I feel faint and my arms are a sickly red and pink colour. I never cared much for contents - I would be happy with a beautiful shell, with nothing inside it. I want to be empty so that he can't torment me anymore. I want him to be dead and gone forever and ever and ever. I want him to leave me alone. I want to beautiful so that everyone will love me and I will be important to everyone. I want to be number 1. Oh Louise, you poor thing, you've been through so much, but it's alright, I love you and I always will. They will love me and I will be loved and there will no more pain."

I hate having to play music very loudly to try and drown out the sound of my mother speaking to horrible men on the phone. 

Reminds me of the time..."

<font face=""Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"" style='color:black; font-size: 10pt;'>
If you can't access the site, you have a minor freak out - and a major case of hitting reload.

You found yourself composing journal entries during dates, movies, even sex!

When you're out, you suddenly think of a witty reply to a comment somebody made to you... several days ago.
  
You actually call it LJ and not Livejournal. Check.

You've downloaded some sort of LJ program which has only the purpose of making entries easier to write without going on the site manually.

You consider it a great offense if someone deletes you off their friend's list. 

The first thing you do every day when you go online is check your friends journals - even before checking your email.

You actually paid money for a few extra pictures with a full account when you could actually just alternate pics when you want to for your screen icons.

When your friends ask what's new, you get mad at them because you already wrote it in your LJ and they didn't check it yet.

You have put more time into LJ than all your assignments for the semester.

You have more friends on LJ than in real life.

You've met at laest 50% of your LJ friends. 

You can't seem to call your friends by their real names - only LJ names will do.

You've fallen in love with someone you met on LJ.

You have posted about a party or get together on your LJ... and random strangers showed up.

You are guilty of traveling more than an hour to meet someone with LiveJournal. (Extra points for traveling five hours or more)

You've written a protected entry about one of your LiveJournal friends. (Extra points if they eventually found out about it)

You have written posts to notify people you're going to sleep.

You talk about your LJ friends to your real life friends all the time... like they're a part of your group.

You've created a LJ community, and people actually post in it.

You've been recognized in real live by a fellow LJ'er.

You have friended someone because of their LiveJournal icon.

You have ""pity friends"" on your list, who you would defriend if you could.

You've pimped one of your friends on journal, trying to get people to friend him / her.

Instead of doing research, you post difficult questions on your LiveJournal.

Your pets all have their own LiveJournals.

You know, right now, how many people have friended you (without peeking).

You've stopped being friends with someone in real life because of something they've said on LJ.

You're guilty of posting sexy or nude pictures to get more people to friend you.

You have consoled yourself after a horrible day thinking ""At least this will make a great LJ post""

You're jealous of people who have more friends and / or comments than you.

You have written a really great, solid post - only to be disappointed by the lack of good comments.

You're guilty of commenting excessively to get more traffic to your journal.

You've deleted a post a few minutes (or hours) after you've written it, because it seemed lame in retro spect.

You give shout outs to all your LJ friends on their birthdays.

You have an additional, secret journal that hardly anyone knows about.

You've broken up with someone - or ended a friendship - soley via LiveJournal.

You have gotten mean anonymous comments (bonus points for figuring out who it was via their IP)

You've been reported (or reported someone) to LJ Abuse.

You've been featured on LJ Drama.

You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other friends who are LJ addicts.</font></td></tr></table>

We got off the Titanic first. 

We get to flirt with systems support men who always return our calls, and are nice to us when we blow up our computers. 

Our boyfriend's clothes make us look elfin & gorgeous. Guys look like complete idiots in ours. 

We can be groupies. Male groupies are stalkers. 

We can cry and get off speeding fines. 

<b>We've never lusted after a cartoon character or the central figure in a computer game. </b>

Taxis stop for us. 

Men die earlier, so we get to cash in on the life insurance. 

We don't look like a frog in a blender when dancing. 

Free drinks, free dinners. 

We can hug our friends without wondering if they're gay. 

We can hug our friends without wondering if WE'RE gay. 

New lipstick gives us a whole new lease on life. 

If we're not making enough money we can blame the glass ceiling. 

It's possible to live our whole lives without ever taking a group shower. 

No fashion faux pas we make could ever rival The Speedo. 

We don't have to fart to amuse ourselves. 

If we forget to shave, no one has to know. 

We can congratulate our teammate without ever touching her butt. 

If we have a zit, we know how to conceal it. 

We never have to reach down every so often to make sure our privates are still there. 

If we're dumb, some people will find it cute. 

We don't have to memorize Caddyshack or Fletch to fit in. 

We have the ability to dress ourselves. 

We can talk to people of the opposite sex without having to picture them naked. 

If we marry someone 20 years younger, we're aware that we look like an idiot. 

There are times when chocolate really can solve all your problems. 

We'll never regret piercing our ears. 

We can fully assess a person just by looking at their shoes. 

We'll never discover we've been duped by a Wonderbra. 

We know which glass was ours by the lipstick mark."

1) I will have a cup of coffee in the morning and read my PAPER newspaper like I used to, before the Web. 

2) I will eat breakfast with a knife and fork and not with one hand typing. 

3) I will get dressed before noon. 

4) I will make an attempt to clean the house, wash clothes, and plan dinner before even thinking of the Web. 

5) I will sit down and write a letter to those unfortunate few friends and family that are Web-deprived. 

6) I will call someone on the phone who I cannot contact via the Web. 

7) I will read a book... if I still remember how. 

8) I will listen to those around me about their needs and stop telling them to turn the TV down so I can hear the music on the Web. 

9) I will not be tempted during TV commercials to check for email. 

10) I will try and get out of the house at least once a week, if it is necessary or not. 

11) I will remember that my bank is not forgiving if I forget to balance my checkbook because I was too busy on the Web. 

12) Last, but not least, I will remember that I must go to bed sometime... and the Web will always be there tomorrow!"

I got out of bed really late becaue im a lazy fuck and its my day off.

I feel a bit strange because we've just moved to Idaho and there's a weird smell in the house.

I'm so stoned.

Last night I had to masturbate twenty times. I'm so horny. Click here to see my website.

I want to tell the world that I'm gay.

I am making this journal Friends Only because of the perverts and stalkers who only want to see my photos.

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! See my Kitty <lj user='sonicthekitty'>

I want to say thanks to the world for absolutely fucking nothing! You all suck. I feel so alone, no one ever reads this journal, or even comments to let me know that I'm not suffering alone. It's cold here, and I want to die, but I cannot figure out how many of you to take with me when I go.

I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have a terrible skin disease which prevents me from coming into contact with other human beings. And bipolar disorder.

You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you you're a moron.

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with this thought - sharing your life with strangers on the internet is the cheapest form of therapy available. Leave a comment and tell me I'm beautiful.

50 Ways to Scare People In the Computer Room

Log on, wait a sec, then get a frightened look on your face and scream ""Oh my God! They've found me!"" and bolt. 
Laugh uncontrollably for about 3 minutes & then suddenly stop and look suspiciously at everyone who looks at you. 
When your computer is turned off, complain to the monitor on duty that you can't get the damn thing to work. After he/she's turned it on, wait 5 minutes,turn it off again, & repeat the process for a good half hour. 
Type frantically, often stopping to look at the person next to you evilly. 
Before anyone else is in the lab, connect each computer to different screen than the one it's set up with. 
Write a program that plays the ""Smurfs"" theme song and play it at the highest volume possible over & over again. 
Work normally for a while. Suddenly look amazingly startled by something on the screen and crawl underneath the desk. 
Ask the person next to you if they know how to tap into top-secret Pentagon files. 
Use Interactive Send to make passes at people you don't know. 
Make a small ritual sacrifice to the computer before you turn it on. 
Bring a chainsaw, but don't use it. If anyone asks why you have it, say ""Just in case..."" mysteriously. 
Type on VAX for a while. Suddenly start cursing for 3 minutes at everything bad about your life. Then stop and continue typing. 
Enter the lab, undress, and start staring at other people as if they're crazy while typing. 
Light candles in a pentagram around your terminal before starting. 
Ask around for a spare disk. Offer $2. Keep asking until someone agrees. Then, pull a disk out of your fly and say ""Oops, I forgot."" 
Every time you press Return and there is processing time required, pray ""Ohpleaseohpleaseohpleaseohplease,"" and scream ""YES!"" when it finishes. 
""DISK FIGHT!!!"" 
Start making out with the person at the terminal next to you (It helps if you know them, but this is also a great way to make new friends). 
Put a straw in your mouth and put your hands in your pockets. Type by hitting the keys with the straw. 
If you're sitting in a swivel chair, spin around singing ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" whenever there is processing time required. 
Draw a picture of a woman (or man) on a piece of paper, tape it to your monitor. Try to seduce it. Act like it hates you and then complain loudly that women (men) are worthless. 
Try to stick a Ninetendo cartridge into the 3 disc drive, when it doesn't work, get the supervisor. 
When you are on an IBM, and when you turn it on, ask loudly where the smiling Apple face is when you turn on one of those. 
Print out the complete works of Shakespeare, then when its all done (two days later) say that all you wanted was one line. 
Sit and stare at the screen, biting your nails noisely. After doing this for a while, spit them out at the feet of the person next to you. 
Stare at the screen, grind your teeth, stop, look at the person next to grinding. Repeat procedure, making sure you never provoke the person enough to let them blow up, as this releases tension, and it is far more effective to let them linger. 
If you have long hair, take a typing break, look for split ends, cut them and deposit them on your neighbor's keyboard as you leave. 
Put a large, gold-framed portrait of the British Royal Family on your desk and loudly proclaim that it inspires you. 
Come to the lab wearing several layers of socks. Remove shoes and place them of top of the monitor. Remove socks layer by layer and drape them around the monitor. Exclaim sudden haiku about the aesthetic beauty of cotton on plastic. 
Take the keyboard and sit under the computer. Type up your paper like this. Then go to the lab supervisor and complain about the bad working conditions. 
Laugh hysterically, shout ""You will all perish in flames!!!"" and continue working. 
Bring some dry ice & make it look like your computer is smoking. 
Assign a musical note to every key (ie. the Delete key is A Flat, the B key is F sharp, etc.). Whenever you hit a key, humits note loudly. Write an entire paper this way. 
Attempt to eat your computer's mouse. 
Borrow someone else's keyboard by reaching over, saying ""Excuse me, mind if I borrow this for a sec?"", unplugging the keyboard & taking it. 
Bring in a bunch of magnets and have fun. 
When doing calculations, pull out an abacus and say that sometimes the old ways are best. 
Play Pong for hours on the most powerful computer in the lab. 
Make a loud noise of hitting the same key over and over again until you see that your neighbor is noticing (You can hit the space bar so your fill isn't affected). Then look at your neighbor's keyboard. Hit his/her delete key several times, erasing an entire word. While you do this, ask: ""Does *your* delete key work?"" Shake your head, and resume hitting the space bar on your keyboard. Keep doing this until you've deleted about a page of your neighbor's document. Then, suddenly exclaim: ""Well, whaddya know? I've been hitting the space bar this whole time. No wonder it wasn't deleting! Ha!"" Print out your document and leave. 
Remove your disk from the drive and hide it. Go to the lab monitor and complain that your computer ate your disk. (For special effects, put some Elmer's Glue on or around the disk drive. Claim that the computer is drooling.) 
Stare at the person's next to your's screen, look really puzzled, burst out laughing, and say ""You did that?"" loudly. Keep laughing, grab your stuff and leave, howling as you go. 
Point at the screen. Chant in a made up language while making elaborate hand gestures for a minute or two. Press return or the mouse, then leap back and yell ""COVEEEEERRRRRR!"" peek up from under the table, walk back to the computer and say. ""Oh, good. It worked this time,"" and calmly start to type again. 
Keep looking at invisible bugs and trying to swat them. 
See who's online. Send a total stranger a talk request. Talk to them like you've known them all your lives. Hangup before they geta chance to figure out you're a total stranger. 
Bring an small tape player with a tape of really absurd sound effects. Pretend it's the computer and look really lost. 
Pull out a pencil. Start writing on the screen. Complain that the lead doesn't work. 
Come into the computer lab wearing several endangered species of flowers in your hair. Smile incessantly. Type a sentence, then laugh happily, exclaim ""You''re such a marvel!!"", and kis the screen. Repeat this after every sentence. As your ecstasy mounts, also hug the keyboard. Finally, hug your neighbor, then the computer assistant, and walk out. 
Run into the computer lab, shout ""Armageddon is here!!!!!"", then calmly sit down and begin to type. 
Quietly walk into the computer lab with a Black and Decker chainsaw, rev that baby up, and then walk up to the nearest person and say ""Give me that computer or you'll be feeding my pet crocodile for the next week"". 
Two words: Tesla Coil."

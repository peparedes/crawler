"event","I am a bit irrotated with jen.... I decited to see what was going on with the york crowd.. and i stumble on some of jens recent posts. I cant help but feel i speak hebrew when i talk to her. because she just does not understand where i am coming from. so now i feel I must explain myself to all that have been seeing me through jens altered perception. not that I havent told jen how I feel but she just cant seem to grasp it.... and maybe i can have someone who can relate just a bit.

first off... reading jennys posts to find out stuff she should have told me really pisses me off. and what I mean by that is our $$. I closed my account in CA and we opened a joint account. I already had a game plan that has not been adhered to, let alone acknowaged. but to look and see she post in live journal to tell others that our account is overdrawn.... and she would not even tell me. seeming even to have no intention to tell me. and 3 days ago we where +$50 and had $100 in cash. the funny thing is that she was afraid to tell me because she was afraid I would be mad. and the most aggervating thing is that I know jenny + $=0 i expect as much. but that is the breakdown in communication that will destroy a relationship. it starts somewhere if you allow it. I am 100% honest with jen. I expect the same. she says that she wanted other peoples input. well let me tell you the input i gave her on how to handle it. first off i take every form of charge card of jennys and put it in a box lock it up and toss it overboard (id do the same for me but i dont own any...). second off I will control all $ and be the bill master. and for the spending $ we each will get $50 a week to spend on nothing at all. that was my proposal. that is the solution. no need to bounce it off anyone. because it will solve the problem. jenny also has 2 other seperate accounts that are overdrawn also... all i can say is *sigh* just getting by is not enough for me. I wont tolerate it anymore.

round 2 >ding< >ding< the sex post; i am not eager to go into this 1 because it it a dead horse and pointless. but here I go again. I have given up on making sex enjoyable for jennifer and by default myself. all sex is to me now is a routine thing that we do together to alivate MY biological urges. i try to make it as quick and painless as possable and only do it when the hand can not sedate the urges. so rather than going out and tearing off a peice from a bar i take 5-15 minutes from jennifer 4x a month 52x a year. I HATE IT. with my other partners sex was something to look forward to and we both enjoyed it. I have tryed everything I know to make it enjoyable for jennifer from taping her up in a sudo bondage attempt and ripping her panties off to lighting candles and playing love music with roses after a romantic evening kissing her from head to toe literly. i truly poured my heart and soul in to her and i lost part of myself in the unaware void that is jennifer sexuality.i cant help but feel i made love to and inatimate OBJECT that cant feel or give love. she tells me she all i feel is pain or nothing but when i have esclated her to the point of climax and she has secreted a large amount of vaginal fluid, breating rapidly and her knees are crushing my skull like a walnut in a nutcracker and her hands come down and push me away because she says i am tickleing her clit and she feels like she is loosing control and she does not want to loose control. then promptly falling asleep after to tell me the next day she felt nothing. just pour my ego in the toilet and flush rinse and repeat. now the solution i have proposed. #1 get a hormone shot because she says she never and has never felt horny. #2 get a sex councler to purge the catholic demons that belive sex has only 1 purpose and that is reproduction and is evil when used as recreation.

"event","i had an interview yesterday. i dunno if i did good or not. it was with a service contracting company called convergys. all i would be doing is answering a phone for 7.50 a hour. it seemed like an ok job :/ and i got a interview without a problem. but when it came to the interview all i was asked was how have you helped customers in 20 different ways ><  
i have never really done customer service but it takes a lot of big person to piss me off. its not like im gonna start yelling back at a screaming customer. i was sure i landed the job but i have yet to hear from them so i dunno if i should keep looking or not. i am a bit new at this NEED a job but dont have one thing. all we gotta do is pay off a few bills then we can be students and keep our computers and cars. i was thinking of also working 2 jobs full time to pull in ""good"" (ya right) money but i dunno if that is asking for a miserable existence. I may just do it if i can. but until then should i file for unemployment? the closer it gets to pay bill time the more uncomfortable i feel. i just wondered if it was worth it but i am thinking of the ""free money"" i am missing out on.
well suggestions welcome :P"

"event","capitalistic society irritates me immensely. i know it has its up side but being on the down side just pisses me off. jenny preemptively payed her bills. and the fine print cost us $250 reduced to $125 after they gave us a complimentary reduction in fine. jenny read that if you want payment to be paid on the 15th of the month that you must set it to post on the 8th. so she set 7 payments to come out on the 8th and figured they would post on the 15th when payments where received. however the money if it exists floats in bank limbo land for 7 days... meaning that it posts to your account 1 week before it is payed to the person or company....

ok so now learning this lets do a simplified version of what happened to the account. ""pay bill....insefitioent funds.... $30.00 fine""""pay bill....insefitioent funds.... $30.00 fine""""pay bill....insefitioent funds.... $30.00 fine""""pay bill....insefitioent funds.... $30.00 fine""""pay bill....insefitioent funds.... $30.00 fine""""pay bill....insefitioent funds.... $30.00 fine""""pay bill....insefitioent funds.... $30.00 fine"" and after a talk with the supervisor he took off 4 of these charges as a courtesy. A COURTESY. so 2 young people who are trying there best tho maintain a standard standard of life just got $125 poorer while the corporate lawyers of fine print and there clients ger $125 richer.... SCORE 1 for capitalism. its not like we work .... and hard for the few spare dollars we make.

this mistake was not of my making and not one that i would have made. however team TAYLOR is a team and we each suffer each others consequences and we reap each others rewards.
    so then jenny sets up more payments to come out on the 15th.... however her pay has yet to post... she luckily canceled them to come out again because.... that whouda coulda been score 2 for the bastards that live on the hill. so I told jenny that she was not to use auto pay unless she had the funds IN BANK not on their way in computerland. trying to get your bills set up to auto-pay is a responsible and convenient thing to do but as we have learned.... it has it inconveniences as well.
 
    I would say the thing that bothered me the most was how she cried on the phone.. jen does not cry often at all. and this made her so sad. that is what makes me so angry. but i rage only on the inside never never let the anger escape. I have had more than my share or counseling in the past. and the way society has taught me to deal with my anger, rage, hatred, loathing, disgruntled feelings is to stuff them away deep inside letting it lay dormant there... and occasionally venting. but it never really dissipates. there is no resolution to it you just target some thing and let the emotion out while the things the make you so mad remain; mocking you, taunting you, and never change. because that seems to be the way of things. when you try to reshape something you find people resisting the unfamiliar shape and restoring it to its lesser form because it is the familiar thing, the most comfortable. change is the unknown and that is fear. fear is uncomfortable which is undesirable. the masses continue breathing the same tainted air because of the great fear. i wish i could be happy in comfort, however to accept what is accepted would be a lie to my nature and natural inclination.and no matter how hard i try to lie to myself the voice just replies ""bullshit"""

TONS of shit has happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;Donny and Amanda got married in July.&nbsp;&nbsp;Best night by far.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was great, especially when&nbsp;Footloose came on.&nbsp; I got my OSAP, so&nbsp;I am officially back at Durham taking Music Business Management.&nbsp; Its great.&nbsp; We went to Cleveland and the Rock and Roll Hall of&nbsp;Fame&nbsp;2 weeks ago.&nbsp; It was by far, a drunk fest...lol&nbsp; I loved it and I cant wait to go back!

Halloween came and went, and the Paranormal Seekers were busy putting on a free seminar at the Oshawa Public Library, doing&nbsp;newspaper interviews, and radio interviews.&nbsp; We&nbsp;registered as an actual business!!&nbsp; and just in time too...&nbsp;We found out that there is another group out there saying they are us and are posting articles.....Copyright&nbsp;Infringement anyone??&nbsp;Its been a crazy past 2 weeks.&nbsp; We meet a new psychic, Ron, whose pretty awesome.&nbsp; We are think of bringing him into the group, but we still need to do a few more things about that.&nbsp; We also have another person that we want in the group.&nbsp; She's awesome, and her, Amanda and I get along really good.. like sisters.. AGHH CHARMED lol.. hahaha

OMG... I just realized that I completely forgot to call my grandfather.. and its his Birthday today.. Shit, I feel so bad... omg...&nbsp;&nbsp; ughh...

Speaking of birthdays, Jay's just passed over the weekend... We took him to Heat on saturday night and he got a bit tipsy.. it was funny.. He has what I call Drunk Rhythm...... can only dance when he's intoxicated.. haha... My birthday is coming up next weekend!&nbsp; So exciting!&nbsp; Im going to Heat for my birthday too!&nbsp; But i dunno what i want to do before hand.&nbsp; I would like to get a limo and take a tour of Toronto and what not, but that costs money... and I want bottle service at the bar...lol..&nbsp; so confused.. i wish I was rich sometimes...lol

I can not believe that its this time of the year..... its totally screwing with me.&nbsp; Christmas is just basically right around the corner.&nbsp; I have no clue what we are doing this year because we are really strapped for cash.&nbsp; Im still working at Campus ID, and basically have that job till I tell her I no longer want it... and this inlcudes next Summer.&nbsp; But right now it is only a workstudy job, so I can only have a maximum of 6 hours a week.. so in a two week pay period I get $120 minus taxes... and thats even if I am able to work 6 hours a week... It really fucking sucks, but I would rather have some money than no money.

Well if anyone wants to donate the&nbsp;""Rachel Needs Money"" Fund, feel free... I accept $100 bills....LOL

I should be doing school work.&nbsp; I have 4 major assignments due in the following 3 weeks and I need to get crackin'.&nbsp; Live Sound is going to KILL me.. As long as I pass the class its allllllllllllllllllllllll good."

Its much better than myspace..lol.&nbsp; I couldnt even believe that I remember my user name and password... talk about crazy shit!<br /><br />Tons have happened since I last wrote on here... which was,, umm.. a year or more ago.<br />I moved out to Oshawa with Jay last August.&nbsp; I graduated College last April.&nbsp; Im working at Durham College now till the end of Summer.&nbsp; Sex Muffin moved in with Jay and I in November of last year... The Paranormal Seekers are still going strong, and we are actually in talks with Rescue Mediums producer Michael Lamport for a television show.&nbsp; Amanda and Donny are only weeks away from getting married.&nbsp; Everything is happening at once!&nbsp; Its nuts!<br /><br />Im currently at work right now, and since no one needs a ID card in June, I just sit around all day, and surf the net.&nbsp; Sometimes my boss gives me something to do, if there is anything to do.&nbsp; But you cant beat a job that pays you good money, for you do basically do nothing.&nbsp; I love it, and it fits me perfectly.&nbsp; I do get the odd person, who lost their ID card and need a new one,but thats maybe one a day.....Maybe...<br /><br />Jay is currently driving through the states right now on his way to North Carolina.&nbsp; I worry about him so much, but he seems to be doing good.&nbsp; He was stuck in a thunderstorm last night and I could hear the thunder over the telephone.. Ya, this phone bill is going to be really really high, as he decided to break his other phone, and he needed to get a new one, and the fact that Im still in Ontario and the roaming fees for our phone calls are going to be highly disgusting.&nbsp; Oh well, I like being able to hear his voice.&nbsp; I do miss him very much, and cant wait for him to be home.. He has been gone since Sunday night.....&nbsp; This week will truly let him know if he is cut out for the long haul trucking industry.<br /><br />I decided to go back to school in September, cuz I realized that I cant counsell people woth shit.... I already listen to enough people in my everyday life bitch about their problems and what not, that I dont think I could handle people that I dont know do it.&nbsp; I would be inclined to tell them exactly where to go and how fast to get there... I would be the counsellor that everyone would hate... or like, as I would tell it exactly how it is, and not sugar coat anything.&nbsp; Im going back to Durham for Music Business Management..... If I can get my OSAP.. If not, im shit out of luck for school, and destined to find another job, as this one im currently at is contract and I am done at the end of August.... Or if I can find my perfect job that will start at the beginning of September, than I wont be going to School at all....&nbsp; I dunno, we''ll see what happens.<br /><br />I have three kitties now.&nbsp; I only had two before but our friend needed to get rid of their cat because of her sister's health condtitions and I didnt want to see it go to the humane society.&nbsp; So we officially own 2 female kitties, named Izzy and Ouija (yes it is named after the Ouija board, like I told everyone I would do), and a male cat named Mater.&nbsp; Mater is declawed and neutered, while Izzy and Ouija are not declawed or spayed.. Hahah poor Mater.. Though last night, Mater and Ouija were trying to play leap frog, but Mater just couldnt jump..LOL.. Ouija is in heat, and since Mater has no balls, he has no clue what to do... So he just kinda sits on her....its so funny.. I tried to take a picture, but the damn cat moves to freaking fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Well I should get going, I got stuff to not do, and ya...lol.. Im so bored, this is getting boring.&nbsp; Im going to go surf the net.. i guess. Dont know what im looking for though.&nbsp; I should go get something to eat for lunch, but I really do need to save my money, as I need to buy cat food before I go home.... I wonder if Dave will meet me down at the Price Choppers and we can go tanning first and then buy some cat food....... Hmmm.. I will have to call and wake the fucker up to find out.</font></p>"

So last night we had our second meeting with Rogers TV... a little late, but who cares.  We were at Williams for 5 hours last night talking about anything and everything under the sun.  We all made plans to go out on Halloween..  I think what we have planned is to meet somewhere, travel to Jester's Court for dinner, then head to Salems Cemetery and a few other places.  I think it will be really really fun.  I cant wait.  We will be discussing this outing on October 24th which is our next Rogers meeting.  Then on November 5th we are going to (hopefully) have our first filming day and night.  Im going to be keeping the location a secret so no one can find us... but then again, how hard is it to not spot a Rogers van..... lol... I guess we will have to cover it up with a black sheet....hahaha.

Did you know that its the End of the world as we know it, and I feel fine??

"event","So this weekend that just past was mighty interesting.  It was Orono Fair weekend!!!  Friday night we spent at the fair, talking to Officer Richards (aka Chocolate Charlie) and Officer Walsh.  Both which are pretty cool people.  On Saturday Mike, Jay and I went shopping.  We went to Picovs and i got a cowboy hat.  I wanted to get a pair of cowboy boots, BUT they were $150....  They were sooooooooooooooo beautiful....  Then that night we went back to the fair and watched the Heavy truck and tractor pull.  Needless to say, I could not hear anything by 11pm.....

Sunday was the most kick ass day of all... Demolition Derby Day!!!!!  As always, I was pit crew.  Given the special designation of ""Stuff Holder"".  Cell phones, cameras, peoples cigerattes and lighters, you name it, it was in my pockets or hanging around my neck.  Tell and his brother Jeff were both driving in the derby.  Jeff did his car up like the UPS Nascar and had all 5 of the boys in jump suits being the ""pit crew"".  He went into best of show and before he drove into the arena, he stopped and all the boys went out, in their suits, and wiped down his car.....  It was the funniest thing that I have ever seen.  He came in second...  Beaten out by Bill in his pink and purple Dora the explorer car...  What a flamer....  But then Tell hit Bill's car in the ring during the derby, knocked out Bill's car, which then set on fire.  Needless to say again, that Bill was black flagged and lost.  Tell made it to The feature, but ended up not going in and saving his car for the Lindsay Derby.  

So On September 24th or 25th... I think its the 25th, Is the Lindsay Derby..  So if you all wanna come, you can... If you wanna chill with me in the pit and be part of the pit crew, its $5.

This weekend is gonna be slow... So far all i know is that Jay and Mike are taking the derby car to the Block to weld it professionally with the big welders.  I also know that Chantelle and I are going to my old stable to look around.  I am going back their for riding lessons and I am trying to get Chantelle to come with me too.  So I figured that i would take her there and introduce her to the horses and see how she likes it....  But come to think of it, the horses are out during the day, and the only real time that we will be able to get face to face with them is to go on a week night....  Hmmmmm.......

So as I said, today was first year orientation..... Lemme say that they are all in for a big surprise.  Bunch of youngin's..... and one of my ex friends is now in my program.  Crazy....  So we led them around the campus showing them important places: Tim Hortons, bathrooms, the Pub, etc...  lol... Then we went to Chantelle's and had a bbq with katie, whitney and robin.  It was fun and exciting and it made my day.

Tomorrow we have our first real classes.  Ken is one of our prof's tomorrow which means that his class is gonna have a lot of powerpoint notes... so maybe I should start to highlight my book now, so that by the time i get in class tomorrow i can start my own notes.

Im so bored, I wish someone would come over, or online.  I wont be able to see Jay till the weekends now, cuz he cant get his car up and going with insurance and what not.  I miss him already.. I love him so much.... ughhhh....

Two weeks and its back to school......  Where did my summer go???  All I can say was that it was a lot of fun and I would do it allllllll over again if i could.

And what was up with Friday's Storm???  That was so crazy.  I was at Jay's and chillaxin' when he came home and said ""Brace yourself, there is a huge storm coming""...So of course im thinking 'right on'.  So im sitting in his kitchen, eating pasta and listening to the radio when i hear the Tornado warning for Toronto and surrounding area.  Now im starting to freak out a bit.  So I finish my pasta (which was soooooooooooo good) and head to jay's room to watch a movie.  Then i started to hear this rumbling sound.  It just kept getting louder and louder..... then i had to pee.... and i was praying that the power would not go out, cuz jay's bathroom has no windows....lol.. After, I headed to the kitchen to where jay was and the storm was just a brewing, and he was on the phone with jim.....  Then Jay's sister comes down to the kitchen and said that she couldnt sleep with all this noise (she works nights at GM).  She said that she turned on her radio and heard that the tornado warning was extended to Oshawa and then she said that when she heard the thunder circle the house, she decided that staying in bed wasnt a good idea.  So we sat and listened to the non stoping thunder.  After a hour or so, it died down and that was that.  We didnt get all the rain or wind that every where else got.

Saturday was ghost hunting day.  We went to Salem's Cemetery, Lakeview Park, Oshawa's Ghost Rd and then back to Salem's Cemetery at night.  It was fun stuff.  And our meeting with Rogers went really well.  We are alllllllll very excited.

Orono fair is coming up in 3 weeks.  The demolition derby is on the sunday which is september 11th.  I believe it starts at 2pm.  My friend Tell is running in it.  Therefore, I need EVERYONE to come out and cheer for him with me.  You dont need to know him, just come and cheer with me.  He's a great guy AND he is Single...lol... It will be fun, I promise. Lemme know if you wanna come and we can arrange where to meet up.

Should get going though.... Dentist appointment tomorrow at 4:30pm.... which means i have to go to my grandparents in the morning and spend the day.  YAAAAAAAAA for the dentist.....NOT"

"event","This weekend was super freaky.  Well more like ""what are the odds"" weekend.

Friday was a blah day.  Jay came over and we went for a walk to burger king.  We were gonna go see Dukes, but decided not to and just save our money.  So after our meal we walked back to my house and i grabbed a few things and we headed over to visit brenda.  While at brenda's we read the emails from Rogers TV and watched Most Haunted at midnight.  Then we decided to drive up to Ghost Rd. at like 1am.  So we get there and there are TONS of cars.  So after about an hour we decided to go drive around downtown port perry.  We drove around and stopped and took a couple pictures of jesters court to see if anything would come out.  Then we decided to head back to Ghost Rd. It was around 4am now and we figured that there wouldnt be any cars.  So we head down the road, and see a car... So we drive by them slowly and what do you know.. ITS ROGERS TV... that was freaking wierd.  So we stopped to talk to them and they were just talking about us.  It was so wierd.  So Brenda talked about the road and the area and totally freaked them out.

Yesterday we went back to port perry and had lunch at the Jesters Court.  Apparently the lights never blink, but when we were there, they did constantly.  Then we went for a drive down ghost rd. so jay could see it during the day.  Its not as scary.  Then we went to Odessy in Pickering and then headed to the Ajax lakeshore to see if we could find that cemetery that has been written about.  So we walked from one end to the next and took every dirt path that we could find.  In the end we found it, but it wasnt on a dirt path.  Crazzzzzzzzzzzzzzy....

Today jay finally got his hair cut.  He looks so hot.  I love him so much.  I wish he was here, but we drove him home.... I came back here because Brenda and I are suppose to either call or go to Jesters court tomorrow to talk to the manager/owner about using the location for our show.  Pretty Cool...

Friday everyone went up to Serpent Mounds and went camping for the entire weekend.  We got there at like 3pm, set up, went to the grocery store at like 4pm, came back to the campsite and settled in for a fun weekend.  By 6:58pm Timmy was drunk outta his mind and by 7:15pm he was passed out......  During that 15 minutes he was the funniest thing in the entire area.  On saturday Johnny got plastered and danced to the Dukes of Hazard CD all night long.

Monday was fun too.  Jay, Jess, Timmy and I went to Wonderland.  Oh the fun.  The Italian JoB Stunt Track was the best!  It shoots you off pretty fast.  It was by far the best ride of the day.

Family Guy is on.  Its really funny.. I love Stewie.

Well Brenda is back tomorrow and I have some really good news to tell her.  Roger's Television is giving us a time slot for a show.  Im very Excited.  It should be good publicity for us.  Cant wait.

Friday was fun.  Everyone went to the movies and we saw War of the Worlds.  It was alright But i just didnt understand the people in it.  If something big is coming out of the ground, I would have been high tailing it outta there soooooooooooooo fast, NOT standing around looking at it..... And then when all the cars stop working, one manages to still be running for tom cruise.... and then driving down the highway, all of cars are meticulously placed so that tom cruise's miracle vehicle can drive through them all.... So this means that the people either drive on the grass and shoulder OR they all got out and pushed their vehicles to the side.... Go figure... Though i will never look at thunderstorms the same way again.  After we went to the lake and watched the fireworks.  Then the boys went to the carnival and played games.  jay won me a big stuff horse.  I love him!!!

Yesterday we went out for Timmy's Birthday.  Jay and I took him to the Keg for dinner and it was soooooooooooo good.. I hadn't had steak in a long time and yesterdays was just awesome.  After dinner we meet up with everyone at North End bowl.  We ended up being their an hour and a half early so we all played arcade games.  I managed to win a lot of tickets that ended up being 620...  Rock on.. Im saving up for a Family Guy doll...lol.. hehehehehe.. afterwards we went to Timmy ho's and hung around there for a bit and talked.

Today is a down day, i guess... Im at jay's house all by myself.  Jay, His sister and his mom went to see his grandfather cuz he isnt doing to good.  I didnt go cuz i only met his grandfather once and i didnt think it was right for me to tag along.  But I got to sleep in till noon, well actually untill Jess called me....lol.. damn her.. she want to me to come and babysit her sister and her sisters friend tomorrow with her at wild water kingdom....So of course, I said i would come, but i need to get a bathing suit tonight.. or tomorrow morning...

So last night was a big bust... Not much to do, but we did manage to make everyone feel good about themselves.  We went to tim hortons and hung around there like we usually do every night.  Then we headed over to Brenda's to give her gas money from friday.  We stayed in there and talked for a little bit.  Then she asked us if we could go get her some milk because she didnt have any, and she told jay and jim that she was so broke and so far in debt that she had to go to the food bank for help.  Next thing I know, we are at A&P buying her groceries.  I have never seen Jim do that EVER!!!! and afterwards he was so happy and giddy...lol... And brenda was shocked and didnt know what to do.

So yesterday was fairly interesting.  Went to the mall with Jess and Ryan.  Came home... diddled around the house for a bit, then went to Brenda's.  I told her about my crazy ass dreams that I have been having lately, and she told me to write them out on paper.  I swear, its the weather..... Im not gonna start to put them on here, cuz you're all gonna think that i need to get help.. LOTS of help...  So then we went back to the Proctor House in Brighton and visited with the curator and his wife.  Then someone from the Brighton newspaper came and he did a story on the group.  We also go to visit the cemetary this time around, and i have to say that it is a beautiful place.  When we got back home we ventured around the old streets of newcastle and visited the house by the lake with the tombstone in front of it.  Its so wierd. 

Today has been nothing.. So far, i have eaten 3/4 of a tub of Ben and Jerry's Half Baked ice cream...yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmy.... for those of you who havent tried it.... GO GET SOME!!  its kinda expensive though.  $5.49 for a tiny little container, but its worth it.  Its chocolate and vanilla ice cream with brownie bits and chocolate chip cookie dough in it.... Its good when your PMSing....lol... hence why i most likely ate the entrie thing.......  Now im drinking Pepsi Lime... Its pretty good.  Better than the Coke with lime..

Im at Jays right now, trying to be realllllllllllllllllllly quiet cuz his sister is trying to sleep.  But all i can hear is the excessive pounding noise coming from the sub in the beretta outside..... its driving me nuts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh well.. its almost done... just some more paint and clear coat and its driveable!!!!!  Well its driveable now, but it doesnt look great.....lol....

I want to go to the Toronto Zoo.... anybody else wanna come on this excursion???  We can all pick a date and go.  It will be fun!  PLEASE???  How about Cullen Gardens??  Wonderland???  CNE???  common people, i know you wanna go!!!  Get back to me on it....

Well i think i will play the sims now..... im obsessed.. and its the sims2 to be exact..lol.. they make out.... hehehehe"

It made her really really happy, which made me feel pretty good myself.  She is really excited and it should be like old times...  Oh those were the days.... lol...

Well we are heading to the mall soon...... as soon as she is finsihed getting ready.. She said that she wanted to be out of here by 9:10am.... thats in 20 minutes.....I highly doubt that she maybe ready....  Oh the good times......i wish i was in highschool again.. well somewhat... not really....

So this sunday is the MMVA's.. It should be awesome.  Like i said to everyone, I better have not spent the night on the streets of toronto for nothing.. I really mean that....

Other than that, nothing is new.  Im at Jess's right now, spending the night because she wants someone to come tomorrow with her and stand in line for concert tickets.  Jay WAS suppose to call me, but he didnt...... Bum.. i wondered if he did call me, but didnt get through because my phone has no reception in her basement... hmmmm..... Oh well...   I love him so much... There is still no date for the wedding....  Though his sister and her fiancee are getting married in August, i think, in their backyard. Should be some good drunken fun.....

Jess is getting mad because the Backstreet Boys havent come on Leno yet... its really funny....lol..

Friday was quite the night.  Jay and mike came and got me at 7pm.  We then headed to Jess, but got detoured along the way, thanks to some young kid who gave mike the finger.  Needless to say, Mike scared the shit outta him, and that kid will probably never do that again.  Then after chillaxing at Jess's house we took the GO Transit system to Toronto.  We arrived at Union at 12:45pm and we started to walk towards Much... It was still warm downtown, but not as hot as we all thought it would be.  When we got to Much, the line had already started.  It went down John street and around the corner.  We ended up being the 112th people in line.  So we parked our butts on the sidewalk and thats were we stayed till 9am.  It turned out to be a very interesting night.  A dozen or more people asked me what we were all doing and of course, the same answers all over again.. time after time....  Then the drunks came out of the bars and staggered home in front of us.  And then the homeless came out.  First some guy come around talking about Jesus, and then another one came around, dressed like jesus and singing about him.  Then one came around and asked Mike if he had any money.  Mike then got in a argument with him and the bum said ""Well i have a wife.""  Mike goes ""You have a wife?  I have a job.""  It was the funniest thing that i heard all night.  Then morning came and the sun came out and it got hot.  By that time we were in standing up waiting to go inside the building.  When we got inside they let us choose where we wanted to go.  We had the choice of watching Alexisonfire, Ciara and K-os on John Street, or Black Eyed Peas, Ashlee Simpson, Billy Talent and the Killers in the Queen street lot.  We took the Lot...  WOO HOO!!!!  Then we headed back to Union and took the Go allllllllllllll the way home.

After that, its all a blur....  To tired and hot to function, so i passed out in jays room and slept till about 8pm, when i got up and went outside to find that Jay and Jim were diddling around with the car.  After that, we went and had a bite to eat and then came home to sleep.  And then when i woke up again, it was today... and now im bored... and hot...   I think im gonna get dressed... thats if i can put my clothes on...."

It makes you all sweaty and sticky.. What we need is a really good thunderstorm... But not until tomorrow afternoon when we come home from Toronto.... Cuz being out in the rain tonight will really suck... Im glad im not in Barrie......

Well i just though I would come on here and see whats up, but not much seems to be going on.  So i think i will just relax and play the Sims... I havent played it in a while and im really bored, so it looks intresting.

Basically everything in a 10 foot radius of him right now is blue.  Its kinda funny.  The reason for this is the paint he is putting on the car.  He accidently spilt it all over his arms, hands and legs the first day he had it out.  Today, he was wet sanding the car and the dust coming off of it was blue.  He kinda look like a smurf sometimes...lol... Smurfs.. such a great 80's cartoon...

So tomorrow night is the big All nighter in Toronto.  We are all looking forward to it.  I think Timmy is now going to come with us.  So thats 6 people we have going... enough to keep us all entertained.  We could make friends with homeless people, and listen to their stories till the morning..... That could be an intersting night.

Tonight was a downer night.  Had basically everyone up at Jay's for a bit, and then we all went to Kelsey's for dinner, where Jim tried to throw his tomatoes over the patio fence and see if he could hit Timmy's truck, but almost managed to land them on his car.  It was great fun while it lasted.  Then Jess dropped my off at my house cuz my daddy is working in Totenham again.

So im hyped up for tomorrow and ready to have a rockin' good time.  Talk to ya'll later!!"

Oh well, we shouldnt complain.  Remember last summer when we barely hit this mark?  Ya, so everyone can shut up.  We complain when we dont have sun and then we complain when we do....WHAT DO YOU WANT PEOPLE?!?!

So Friday night should be interesting.  A bunch of us are going to Toronto and pulling an all nighter to get wristbands for the MMVA's.... I know it sounds kiddish, but we have to do something interesing this summer.  It will be a bonding experience for all.  If anyone wants to come, lemme know.  We are taking the last Go train into Toronto on Friday night, after we get a few drinks into us.  We want to get as many people as possible.

Last night was so weird.  Jay, Jim, Tim and myself went to the Tim Hortons on the 115 up north... The one at Shawn's house... my ex-boyfriend...  So we pull in, and guess who is standing around outside... Shawn... GRRRRRRREAT.... so we go inside and get our drinks and sit down to wait for Timmy. Timmy pulls in, talks to Shawn outside for a good 15 minutes, parks and comes in.... Followed by Shawn.  Well they get their stuff and both of them come and sit down with us.  This is like a first because everytime Shawn has seen me, he usually runs away after he says hi.... well he sat with us the entire time and talked with me, like nothing had ever happened.. Which I guess is a good thing.... Oh well.. He's a big liar and the shit that was coming out of his mouth was incredible.  Even Timmy was commenting on the way home about the bullshit that he was flinging.

Yesterday was an interesting day.  Jim came and got me at 12:30pm and I went with him to drop off his car in Cobourg at the dealership to get the speakers fixed.  Then we walked around Cobourg for 3 hours and had munchies at Caseys.. I wondered if Gifford was working, but didnt bother asking...  We had a good laugh and enjoyed our visit...lol..  Then we came back home and went to the mall with dave for a bit.  It was really boring and i bought myself a Chocolate cookie Yogen Fruz.  It was quite yummy.  I want another one...... NOW!  Then after our mall excursion, we came back to Jay's and helped primer the car....  But firsted, we watched Mike bag himself while riding Jay's pocket bike.  Which was so funny that jay's dad was having a hard time controlling himself.  Im so glad that someone in the group is good to laugh at.  And then I managed to massacre 15 june bugs with my flip flop..... Im so evil....

So today is a gorgeous day, and the boys didnt have to work, but are out working on the car.  I wish it would just hurry up and get done with.  Its so boring to sit here night after night not being able to do anything cuz everyone is busy with the car and no one can take me anywhere, and no one wants to come up here cuz its in the boonies.....  This sucks being so far away from civization.....

I am hoping that I can do something very fun tonight.  Very Very fun... so i can wear my new shirt that i bought yesterday.. it is very pretty, silky and light green.... i love it...   If anyone has any fun idears, lemme know.  Im really really bored..."

On the other hand, i saw Madagascar and was really unimpressed.  If it wasnt for the penguins the movie would have been a complete disaster.  I also saw The Longest Yard, and that was by far, the best movie i have seen this year.  Adam sandler is hot.... im sorry, but he is...lol

So i am at home right now.. with nothing to do, but then again it is 12:50AM....  Tomorrow I am going with Jim to Cobourg to get his car stereo system fixed, so i have to be up, showered and ready to go by noon... Good luck to myself.... Im so lazy....

It all started with Mike talking about some stupid joke about people who carry a monkey in their trunk of their car and he attacks stupid people.  Now its like an everyday conversation.  ITS GETTING ON MY NERVES!! AGHHH!!!  Well last night, i got back mike pretty good.  He was starting on his trunk monkey story again, and this time he decided to add that he had a trunk monkey.  So of course I piped up ""Well if you have a trunk monkey, why is he driving??""  Man oh man, did he ever get pissed...lol.. well everyone else laughed their asses off at him.  Oh god... so funny...  I burned him good.  Im so proud of myself.

Today has been kinda boring.  Im at jays and thank god he got off work early.  Tonight should be interesting.  We are all going out for dinner or coffee, and we are going to see Madacasgar.  I cant wait.

The other night, I got Dave to sit down and watch Team America: World Police with me.  Holy Shit, did he ever laugh.  It is the funniest movie that I have ever seen.  Puppets having sex is something that i never thought was possible, but thanks to the creaters of the movie, it has been done.  Its just way too funny.  I would suggest that everyone should go out and watch it.  SO funny...lol... hahahaha...

Friday was interesting.  Timmy got drunk and we video taped him making an ass out of himself.  Saturday was so hot and sunny, I got burned everyone..including my ankles and my hands. Saturday night was cold, windy and wet.  My tent tried to eat itself, but i stopped it.  Sunday was a little cool and cloudy, but the races were awesome.  Through it all, the neighbors we had were a pain in the ass.  I could have shot them.  They let there kids run rampant and then proceeded to yell their heads off at them.  And then the had their rotwieller there and it just barked and barked... But it was better than the kids, i have to admit.  I think there should be a section for families and a section for those who want to party and watch the races.

Sunday night was ok.. I was feeling the burger diet from the weekend, so i was kinda ugh.  Mike had a shing-ding and got really drunk and destroyed his back yard...lol...  I went back to jay's and had a good nights sleep in a bed. 

Last night was fun.  We went to Tanya and Johnny's and shot fireworks off at the park by their house.  $400 got us a half hour of boom...... Then we went back to their house and sat around the fire in the back yard and talked about stuff.

Today I had my interview with Big Brother and Sisters for my placement for school.  I hope i get it.  I need to find one ASAP.  And today at 2pm and 5pm our group is on TV.  Channel 10 - Rogers Television!!!  WOO HOO!!!  You all better watch it!

We got there at like 6:45pm and headed straight to the restuarant, even though our reservations werent until 8:30pm.  Well i hesitated a bit before i got on the elevator, but i managed to get on.  It was an interesting ride up... The resuarant was AMAZING except highly expensive.... it cost the four of us $286.71 for dinner..... Lets just say, i felt very high class.  Then it started to lightning out.  Now that was cool... It seems so much closer when you are that high in the air....Then i stood on the glass floor and thought i was gonna cry.... The ride down was a lot better cuz i couldnt see anything because it was dark....  Then we toured around toronto for a bit before we headed home.

But that last time we were there, the DJ gave me and Jess Jello Shooters that had so much Vodka in them, I thought I was seriously gonna upchuck it.... Cause as you all know, Im not use to drinking hard alcohol.... LOL

So last night was kinda interesting... Didnt do to much... Attempted to go mothers day shopping again, but didnt succeed one bit.  So I think today Im just gonna go to Shoppers and buy my mommy some bath stuff and what not.  So at the mall, Jay gave me $100 to go shopping with, but i couldnt find anything that I liked... We also met up with Chantelle and got the chance to hang out with her for a bit.  Now that was cool... I havent seen her in like a week or so.  After the mall, we went over to the LCBO and i spent half of that $100 that Jay gave me..... Im bad... lol.. thats all for tonight though.  When we finished buying out the LCBO we met up with Mike, Jim and my Sex Muffin at Kelsey's in B-Ville.  It was a good ol' time... lol... After dinner and drinks we met up with Tanya, Johnny and Mike at Tim Hortons at the Walmart.  We were only there for a little bit, but long enough to makes plans for tonight.

But since I am at Jay's I cant do much right now except be on here for a little bit and then go have a shower and get all nice and clean for later.  Well, Im heading out... I still dunno what to wear tonight.... Skirt or pants?? Maybe Capris..... Who knows...lol"

I still dont have a job.  It seems no one wants me.  I go in for interviews and they tell me they are gonna call me back and then they dont.. fuckers...
We had to put my puppy down last weekend cause she was sick, so no im dogless..... its sad... i miss her.
The group and me get to go to The Proctor House on Tuesday and kick some ghostly ass.  Then on Wednesday we head back to the Whitby Centennial Builidng and get interviewed by Durham Living, who wants to do a story on us, and then possible get us our own tv show.... Exciting.
We finally picked a weekend to go to Grand Bend!! July 8 - 10th.... I cant wait.
Jess is back for the summer and I have seen her basically every day.  I am so happy that I finally have my best friend back.  Just looking back on the olden days...4 years ago or so.... is just so funny and we laugh so much.
Then there was Timmy's 17 year old stalker.... HAHAHA  omg, this is something to laugh about.  I pretended to be his new girlfriend, and this little girlie freaked out.  And then she called back and said that i was a ""Nasty Whore with Gonnereha""... and then had her cousin call me and yell at me, which was so hilarious, cuz she didnt make any sense.  Now she thinks that Im the daughter of a Toronto Cop.... She's a little stupid....   Then she called him and left a message on his voicemail... which wasnt really a message but a song.  This song was actully F.U.R.B.  Which if you can recall is actually called Fuck You Right Back, by Frankie...... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHA!!!!  
And since I have no job right now, I get to volunteer at Parkwood as a tour guide.... Im happy.. at least it gets me outta the house.

Thats about it.  My life in like 2 weeks or so... very exciting.. Most of it is spent at Jay's house watching Tv and waiting for him to get his ass off work... and then the rest of it is spent sanding down the Beretta and getting it ready to be painted...  My life is so full of excitment.  

Well im heading off to do something.. dunno what, but it better be fun.. Timmy is coming to get us is a couple of hours and then we are going Mother's Day shopping and im going to get myself a new bar outfit, that jay is going to pay for.  Have a good weekend everyone and if you wanna do something, GIVE ME A CALL!!!!"

"event","So ya, im here at school, in a lab, like 2 hours before my crisis exam.....  So much for studying, huh...lol.... Ughh.. i cant wait till this is over and my three days of placement, and then I still have to find my second year placement and get that in place... Damn.. Its almost got me thinking i need to go into another area... Something more hands on and fun..... like Auto Body...lol.. HAHAHAHAHAHA...

So this weekend was kinda boring.  Friday, sex muffin, boinking danish and myself went to Montanas.. It was good and muffin sure drank enough.  Saturday, we went to the lake and hung out with Tanya, Johnny, Mike, Knapp, Crystal and Jim.  Had a good time laughing at Knapps stupid car.  Accident in Progress is what we like to call it.....  I didnt think anyone could get a sunfire to look THAT bad..... but then again, when you give anything to knapp, it turns out like shit.....  Sunday as a down day.  Dave and I sat around jays while he primered the hood of the beretta.  Its gonna go on the road soon and then we are also getting a truck.  Then we will be REAL hicks...lol... Gotta love the hickness.  Yesterday was kinda boring too.  Slept in, got up, attempted to study, then jim came and got me and we went for a cruise to his grandparents house and canadian tire and so on.  Then before we went home some stupid kids were mouthing at us so we followed them for a good 30 clicks and scared the crap outta them... Teach them to mess with us.... Fuckers...

I wish this day would go by faster.... I wish that I already had my placement picked out for second year.  I wish that it was summer and that I was on my way to grand bend, or toronto, or nova scotia, or Belleville, or Kingston...etc etc...lol

Speaking of heading out east, we got another investigation coming up and around the corner.... Proctor House has given us the Go ahead to have a tour and investigate!!!!  We are so excited.. I love it!!!!  This summer is gonna rock... 

Well im gonna go study..... yes... maybe... probably not.....  Good luck everyone on your exams!

And then NO MORE till september!!!  Im so happy I could sing.. but not in this computer lab, to many people... I would make a fool of myself.... Ughh.... damn people...

So last night I had my interview at IGA.. the lady is so nice, and from what I got from it, she basically is gonna hire me... Woo hoo for myself!! Then I went and sat through my boring placement luncheon..... Thank god it was fast.... Then afterwards we went to the mall and my little sex muffin gave me some money to buy myself some stuff.. I love my little sex muffin... He rocks my world.... 

Well tonight, i have no clue what we are doing.  All i know is that i want to go dancing with my little sex muffin and all my friends... I just wanna dance dance dance.... and my little sex muffin better not get yucky sick this time... I will beat him up if he does...  Beat him up good....

So right now I am at school and im just sitting here bored.... its 10am and my class dont start till 1pm..... but this is like the only time i can get on the computer without someone breathing down the back of my neck.....  And damn MSN is taking its sweet time to download.. fucker.... i hate these computers... but what can you do?.... Nothing....

So they wrote off jay's car... those bastards..... To me, everything looked good, and it could be fixed, but those damn air bags.... this means that jay is out looking for a new car.  He found another cavalier z24 that is identical to the old one for cheap and not that many clicks on it and in good conditions, so he's gonna check it out.  I told him to get it if he thinks its good, cuz then he doesnt have to tell anyone that we smucked up the first one....  Im smart :)

Anyways, Im gonna get a move on and beat the shit outta this computer beacause its taking a shit load of time to download msn messenger.... Alright... Anyone wanna come out with us tonight to go dancing, LET ME KNOW!!!!"

So today was my last tuesday at school!!! WOO HOO!! no more stupid lifeskills telling and sharing classes!!!!  And we found out that our prof use to do all kinds of drugs...lol.. no wonder she seems all messed up....

Last night was like a down night.. we didnt do much but sit around in timmy ho's and drink coffee and eat donuts.  Very boring but a nice looking cop came in, so i was preoccupied for a little bit.

Right now, some of the best people in my life are going through a rough time.  And there are a few of us that are somewhat trapped in the middle.  Im not gonna be choosing sides, and im sure the others feel the same way or somewhat the same way.  I dont wanna hear one thing from one person and then something different from the other.  I would like to be kept out of the whole thing... I dont really want to hear hundreds of different stories because it will just bring me down even more.  I just got out of a rough patch and dont want to go into another one.   If you need to go out and drink away the roughness, then give me a call and I will come out with you, BUT no complaining to me.  

I love all my friends and hate to see you all like this, but thats just the way life treats everyone.  It will all get better one day.  It may not be today, or tomorrow or in 6 months from now, but it will get better.  Love you all!"

Apparently he is really funny and they all want him to hang around with us sometime.  YAAA i get to hang around with my little brother!!  Woo freaking hoo....  Then we went for a drive and Dave yelled at everyone and anything.  I laughed so hard, I thought I was gonna die.  We eventually ended up at the lake and decided that we wanted to play on the playground.  You never really know how much you miss being a little kid until you are 20 years old and you go and play on a playground at 9:30 at night......  We're going back tonight to have some more fun and we are bringing Tanya and Johnny with us.... 

So ya, other than that, my day is so far doing ok.....  Interviewing and Counselling final test at 8am this morning.. DONE.... Sociology final test at 9am... DONE... NO MORE!!!  Which is such a relieve.... Im happy, but starving and Williams doesnt start to serve good food until 10:30.... 15 more minutes.

Well this is incredible boring and I want Taco Bell really badly...... Maybe we will end up at such a place for lunch.. I only have like 7 bucks on me..... Damn money.  Never seems to stay in my hands or pockets... FUCK!

Yesterday we came to a decision, half of it was my idea, on how we are going to go camping.  We are going to be sitting down very shortly and talk about when we are going.  We are definetly gonna go to Grand Bend for a weekend.  But the my idea was to have everyone sign a waiver stating that if they back out for any reason, then they still have to pay  for there share of the camp site/rental/whatever.  That way, the rest of us aren't left high and dry trying to find the extra money to go.

Sounds good, huh.. Anyone wanting to come with us lemme know.  Then you can come and plan with us!!!"

My first one since a week ago.  Jay is upstairs in my room and i have no clue what he is doing.....  Maybe is he playing with himself???   lol...

So on friday, the group got together.. The WHOLE group! and we went to Union Cemetary in Oshawa.  Such a fun time.  We went there originally looking for jay's sister, but we couldnt find her.  But I will never forget getting so freaked out that me and Brenda ran right into jay and dave.... And then before we were leaving, I was walking alone, and Brenda and Dave went to the big building that is right ahead of you when you walk in the gates coming off of Hwy 2.... All I head was pounding footsteps and then saw the two of them high tailing it outta there... funny, but they were scared shitless.  Speaking of which, I should watch what mike was recorder.

Yesterday I slept all day, which was nice.  Then we went out with Tanya and Johnny to the lake and I got to meet some awesome people and their awesome rides.  Now I want a cool car.... And the Today I saw some chick with MY car!!!  MY HOT PINK MUSTANG!!! but it wasnt convertible so she can eat me.....

Today we also went back to Union Cemetary to see if we could find Jay's sister in the light.  Took us a while to find the baby section, but we eventually found her.  Its really sad to look down and see someone who would have been your sister in law, and in jay's case, his 2nd oldest sister.  She had a pretty name though...Sara Lynn.... Very pretty.. she was born in July and died in September of 1980.... only 2 months old.... I would love to go and put flowers and what not on her grave site, just so she is remembered.... I have to talk to brenda about this though, cuz there was other things that happened while we were there.

Anyways, sorry to leave everyone on a sad note... But hey, things like this happen..... Its finally warm out so things will get better!  Talk to ya'll later!"

Let me just say that its like a small bus with comfy seats and a lot of leg room.  Its nice to finally be able to sit all the way back and my lil sex muffin sit behind me and still have lots of leg room...... Gotta love the rent a wreck...

So Im finally at school,on a short break before i have to go and listen to second year students talk about their placements.... Im so interested..NOT!  Tonight, i have no clue what I am doing, but I hope its fun and has to do with my lil sex muffin and his horizontal mambo Mousse....lol.. and my boinking danish...lol... gotta love it.... kinda makes me want some desserts...... yummmy... sugar...lol...

For the past three days, I have spent shopping at walmart..... THREE DAYS!!!!  but we didnt buy anything yesterday.. we were, but then they didnt have it anymore, so now i wanna go to future shop or best buy to see if they gots what i want...its a movie.... Unsolved Mysteries: Strange Legends....  I know i know, im crazy, but thats what you all love about me

I gots a tummy ache

Im hoping for a investigation soon... school is almost over and im gonna need to do something with my free time, before i seriously need to get a new job.  Ughhhh.......  Somebody save me!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Or bring me someplace interesting....

Jay and I were thinking about where we want to go this summer.  We are thinking that in August, if we have some money, we are gonna go and drive down to PEI/Nova Scotia/New Brunswick.... and we are thinking of taking 2 people with us.. Of course, my lil sex muffin will be one of them, and then he can bring whoever he wants... preferably someone interesting.....lol....  I think it will be fun... I wanna do something memorable this summer....  Not just work my ass off...

And I was also talking to sex muffin about my wedding plans and how i dont want to have the traditional boring 'honeymoon' night where the bride and groom go off and do whatever by themselves.  Its my wedding day and I want to spend it with EVERYONE because Jay and I will be married for the rest of our lives (i hope..lol) and who knows about our friends... So my plan was to have the wedding, then have the reception at like a banquet hall or what not (have it for like a few hours, with NO open bar... SORRY!!!!) and then head out someplace fun, like Mosport for the weekend and go camping, get real drunk and watch the races... I think that would be kick ass... I would certainly remember that day and so would everyone else...... That way, its not just another 'wedding reception'... but a Weekend long PAR-TAY!!!!!!!!  So of course, this means its gonna be in the summer...lol.. No spring, fall or winter wedding... I want mine to be warm...  So if anyone has any suggestions for this, lemme know!!

Well I should get going, I gotta walk all the way to the third floor of the university building for my next class... and then back to this building for my other one.... So give me your suggestions guys!!!!!!"

So I sit here with a freaking cut on my cheek, a bruise on my forehead, a bruise on my chin, half purple lips, and fucked up eyes that burn.  I wish those fucking things woulnd't have gone off, I would have been a lot better....

The good thing is that I just got off the phone with Jay, and the insurance dude was out too look at his car, and said they are gonna fix it.  Or atleast try to anyways.  I have a strong feeling that they will fix it.  I love that car.... 

So right now, I am sitting here waiting for Jim... He's been such a great friend... driving everyone around for the last few days without asking for anything but a cup of coffee and some timbits.  I know he doesnt want to take any money from us for gas, but i feel like we owe him that.  Coffee and Timbits only gets you so far.  Thank god for Jim.

Last night was so BORING.  Mike had to fucking rip his exhaust off when he decided to visit the ditch on saturday.  And i dont just mean the muffler, but the whole fucking system.  So last night he drove it to jays and we spent the entire night trying to put it back together.  Meanwhile, my little sex muffin was at Durham, bored outta his skull waiting to see if we would ever come to get him.. But NOOOOOOOOOO, Mike needed everyone to help him..... So there was Jim, on the concrete getting dirty, Jay on the concrete getting dirty, and Mike on the creeper... WHATEVER.. At the end of the night everyone was peeved beyond belief.  The only reason why Jay helped him was because he wanted to make sure that the group had two cars going instead of one.. Thats the only reason.... ONLY REASON....

Travelling down the 115, hit a pocket of water, lost control, slammed into the centre median, bounced back spun around 3 times, slammed into it again, and then jay managed to stop it on the shoulder.  Mike and Dave were in the back and they are perfectly fine.  Jay's wrists are sore from trying to keep control and having the air bag smack them.  My face is fucked.  I have a black eye, scratches on my cheek, swollen lips, skratched on my chin and forehead. I have airbag dust in my eyes so they are constantly leaking and burning.  It also hit my sinus, so my nose is leaking like a faucet.

I feel so bad, cuz i pushed jay to leave the house early and go to Belleville.  If it wasnt for me, he would still have his car..... All I do is cry and cry and cry about this.  I feel like its my fault.  I wish things would go back to the way they were yesterday.  I want this all to be over and to have never happened.  WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!????

So many fender benders on the roads, and Jim saw some accident on the 401 where the car ended up 80 feet into a field (kinda feel sorry for there tow bill).  Then on Saturday, on our way up to the Blue Heron, some idiot was tailgating Jim, then passed him and Jay at the same time and then was tailgating Mike.  So we decided to have some fun.... hehehehe... Well this idiot was about, i'd say 10 feet from Mike's ass, so Mike slams on his brakes.... Stupid swerves all over the road, while jay and jim both slam on their brakes.  Then this idiot goes to pass Mike, so Mike decides to move over with him and drive in the middle of the road.  At this point, Jay has his brights on.  So we get to the casino, and we go in the entrance, and the stupid idiot doesnt turn into the entrance, but goes up one further and enters in through the exit.  Guess he was a little scared.  Idiot...

Anyways, so ya.. we didnt end up going to le skratch cuz they wouldn't let Jim in with his blue pants on.... thats right, Jim is in a gang... the Blue Pants Gang.. stupid fuckers.... So instead, we all went glow in the dark mini golfing and went to the Casino.  I guess it was better than sitting around twiddling our thumbs.  Jay lost all his money, but with the few coins he had left, I won it back PLUS $3.50... Im good...lol

Last night we went to my grandparents for dinner (soooooooo yummy) and then we went to the movies (again) and saw Ms. Congeniality 2.  It was good.  Though i would have to agree that the first one was better.  But the best part of the movie, wasnt even the movie... It was the previews.  Im so going to see The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants (Dave you are coming with me!!!! its has ALEXIS BLEDEL IN IT!!), and im going to go see Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (Johnny Depp is HOT) AND im gonna go see Bewtiched.  It looks like its gonna be a sweeeeeeeeeeet ass movie, and im taking Brenda to see it! 

Right now, I am at school, in a lab, and my tummy is doing this wierd noise.  I think im digesting my food.  Cool.... Im bored, so im gonna go surf the net, check jay's email, harass random people, you know fun stuff.  BUH BYE!!"

I guess another time... damn boys...lol..  And afterwards we went to Tim Hortons across the street from the AMC and chillaxed with the gang.... Got home at about 1:30am.. it was allllllll good.

So many people almost hit us cuz none of them are paying attention.  Didn't see to many cops though.  Seemed like they were hiding, which was a good idea.  I wouldnt want to have been driving.  Being a passanger was scary enough. 

The night before we went to Ghost Rd with the crew.  Jim stood out of the sunroof and video taped.  Crazy nut.  He's the only one who could fit out, or at least the only one who tried.  He's funny though.  Very technical.  He should be in the group.

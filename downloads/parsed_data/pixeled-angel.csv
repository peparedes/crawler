So the computers here in the SLC dont like me:

Uploading an image works in every program.  Except Illustrator.  I tried the PCs and no dice.  I was re-directed to the Mac lab.  No dice.

At this point, i have several options available to me:

a) ""Andrew Sartain? Hey it's V.  There's a 6pack of beer here for the first person to bring me CS2. Move your ass.""

b)""Mattie? Hey, i was wondering if i can just stroll into your shop and transfer CS2 to my computer real quick-like? plz? kthnxbai.""

c)""Hey, Greg? Hi, It's V, the person ur interviewing tomorow at 9am? Yea, I'm going to need to re-schedule.  That looks nice on a first impression, right? kthnxbai""

d) wake up at 7 am.  Go to car repair shop @8 am. bust open car and go to glove compartment.  Steal I-pod back. Pray and pray and pray that my shit's still on there.

e) *Humps bittorrent till i get CS2* kthnxbai. pull all  nighter.


did you hear that? That was the sound of my goddamned brain imploding. ha. ha."

So in a fit of -something- I deleted my works from my computer.  ""I'm a terrible artist, etc.""

and of course.

I have a possibly permanent position in a screen printing company as their graphic designer.

and by 9am tomorow. I need my shit back. All of it i've done in illustrator.

And my CS2 just kicked the bucket.

I saw my first racoon today.  It was young.  It was small.  It had people hands that were leathery and with thumbs.  It had fingernails and a long snout. It's face was gray with black patches on It's  eyes.  It also has brown and black tails, alternating in ringlets.  It has an incredible curiosity and people hands to help it explore.  It grunts/snarfles.

"event","Surgery is on the 12th.  I'll be having a cadaver graft....yes, that's right.  *Slice* out of Mr. Johnson and *Slap* on to me.  Yes, it will be bizzare.  I'm terrified of the possibility of disease coming into my body along with the tendon (possible but not likely) but it's the best possible graft for the contact sports i'd like to return to.  Physical Therapy will be hell on wheels in a black dress (don't ask.  those are lyrics.) but im strangely looking foward to it.

Trying to decide what draft to do my doctor asked what kind of activity level I'm looking at after recovery: 
""Just walking around? Standing for your job and some gardening? Baseball?""
""Martial Arts and i may be taking up water polo. Also, i want to give Rugby another try.""
""...O...K.....Cadaver graft it is."""

"event","After my MRI i was taken to phisical therapy where i listed off everythign that had happened to my knee.  Each injury made my therapist go o.o and scribble something down furiously.  Afterwards finding out my sport loves, my lifestyle and such, he gave me a timeline:
in 2 weeks- surgery
in 3 weeks post surgery-back to work
in 6 mo. post surgery-rugby and water polo.  He specifically wants to get me back into heavy contact sports.  I think i've become his project.

Thearpy has shown me not only how out of shape i am but also what happens when you apply electrodes to my thigh and knee.  It goes twitch.  And feels so fucking weird, let me tell you.  Bizzare.

Sebastian has been nothing less of a guardian angel trough all this, refusing to leavey my side most of the time, even with the door wide open, whimpering when i hobble out of his sight.  God i love that dog.
Ethan's mom and I have begun fretting unnecesarily about pet food.  With the whole mess of recalls, ""It's just cat food. Whoop, actually just wet cat food.  And wet dog food.  And maybe dry cat food.  Did we say cat food? We meant dog food.  Um....Just dont feed your pet till this is over, mkay?"" we've been thanking out lucky stars for Purina dry dog food. 


Part of me is pretty of disgusted at the fact that this is actually taking up space in my brain and worrying me.  I'm fed, loved, housed,relatively healthy and alive and safe.  So much so that my worries include dog food quality and wether or not i'll be aproved for short term dissability leave from work.  I'm not worrying about famine, disease, death, food...But i'm not entirely sure what to do about this other than continue to be disgusted at the moment.  I know, useful, right?"

Melissa Carrasco.  

Went to Mater Salvatoris; Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico; with me and graduated on to Academia Maria Reina for high school.  Last i heard, she was thinking about going into pediatric cancer at Yale or Harvard.  But then again, i dont quite trust the source i got that from.

I remember that her sister's name was Graciela Carrasco but other than that, i seem to have forgotten any other details that may be helpful.

I'd really really like to get back into contact with 'er.  If anyone knows of any leads or ways to find ppl, email me:

"event","so this is where i catch myself in the mirror as i cross my room.  And i stop the clock and stop being hectic and desperate to get out of the house
i stop and look at myself
and somehow i see her there or the situation and sorry lovesickness staring back at me from that mirror.
And thats when i stand a lil bit straighter and say 'fuck it'
and take another step to leave.
but that step never happens
because i realize all too soon that its easier said than done.

Thats when i stand there in silence in a dimly lit room
sorrounded by nothing but concrete walls,
silence,
and things i believe to belong to me.
And force myself to say 'fuck it' again.
because its about time that i realize the blood im loosing through the open wound that she created.
that sweet wound i dont mind
i almost urge it on.

But i dont buy it.  My mind can say it all it wants but its not working.
and the more i tell myself 'fuck it/screw it/forget about it/its a lost cause/ur wasting your time' 
the more aparent i make it to my brain that im not giving up any time soon...
and the more aparent it is to me inside that it might not work, ever...
and no sooner has this phrase hasnt left the lips of my mind
when my concious is already saying ""drop the 'might' in that statement,
and you might be a lil closer to reality""

I dreampt i kissed her once.
i remember my stomach feeling like it was going to flip from being so nervous
then i woke up
to the same concrete walls
and silent room
and orange streetlamp light flooding my bed

And i think 'ur wasting ur time again' to myself once again as i roll over and go back to sleep
And i let my mind keep believing that lie
that ill get over it soon
and let it feed on this lie
and make it sane one more day

*yawns*
tired
g'nite"

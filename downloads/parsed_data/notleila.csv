"event","i just registered for the GRE general and subject: chemistry tests. the dates are October 27 and November 3. so while everyone else is partying for one straight week because it's halloween, i will be in the library studying. i enjoy scheduling exams during big parties. total cost: $270. 

in terms of the accordion, i am starting to play loud and out, with other people. i have to work on a few things still but i basically have it down. i intend defy the female grungy circus accordionist stereotype and invent a new style of music. it will be oriented toward traditional itallian and french folk music with a classical spin, mostly instrumental but with a little bryan singing in the background. take that, gutter punk train hoppers from orange county. who would jump on a moving train with an accordion anyway, it is completely impractical and dangerous. but i can't tell if it is just one or all of you, as you are impossible to tell apart. your trust fund will not buy originality."

"event","hi livejournal. it's been so long. a lot has been happening. here's a list:

1. out of towners staying at my house for weeks on end, messing up the kitchen and talking loudly on the porch after 10 pm. i am a sound sleeper and did not know the extent to which this was occurring. the neighbors filed a complaint with the landlords and we almost got evicted. i spent every hour of free time over the last four weeks looking for a new apartment or house before realizing that i didn't have to, and didn't want to move. so that's resolved.

2. crazy. i am crazy. i yell a lot and get upset easily. i can't handle partying anymore. i get stressed out about going to shows. all i want to do is stay at home, but i get bored while i'm there so i go out, but the whole time i'm out i get overwhelmed and want to go home, then i get home and it starts over. but anyway. 

3. i bought a new accordion and it is beautiful and has good sound. i would play it more if only i didn't feel self-conscious about practicing in front of other people. but i will soon get over it.

4. grad school. i will be applying over the next couple of months. you are sure to hear more about this as the search progresses. 

5. vaginal itch. i have it and am too busy to go to a doctor. to treat it i have tried monostat, acid washes, plenty of yogurt, loads of garlic, and nothing, as well as cutting out the fermented beverages, sugar, and bread. i think it's getting better. at this point i am sure it's BV. hopefully it will clear up during my next period.

6. great food. i have been making some very delicious meals lately. i call it, cross cultural cooking. it is like the stuff you would find in the vita cafe except much better. 

and also: I am completely in love with my boyfriend, bryan. he is amazing and i am so happy to be with him."

bryan and i are in the market for a new vehicle. currently, i own a 92' tercel which runs great but honestly. we like to pick up hitch hikers too much for a two-door car to suffice. we were driving out of arcata and whining at the sight of all the cute hitchers on the side of the road that we couldn't accomodate. we already had one, a deadbeat lazy boring ""back seat driver"" from OK. i drove him all the way from mutant fest and put him up at a friend's for three days, and he just sat there watching tv and begging for food and cigarettes. a bad catch.

on the minus side. i got really sick and crazy. friday night, crazy/belligerent and annoying. my friends were getting sketchy $10 tatoos and i got really upset. but i couldn't leave. saturday night, everything was okay. sunday night... deathly ill. i got food poisoning from eating ""green bread"" and lay in the bushes puking for hours. it caused a scene. after i finished puking and after bryan smooched ethan, we rode to the mt. tabor reservoir and fell asleep in the grass. 

at first i complained on and on about how bryan didn't care about or respect me. how could he not take care of me when i was sick (""i didn't know you were sick!""), how could he kiss ethan right in front of me (""i didn't kiss ethan!"") it's not pretty but i think we slept most of it off and now i'm subdued about the whole thing. he gave me a bike, i gave him a ride to work. he gave me a six pack of beer for $1, i retrieved his two backpacks. and thus it's settled."

i've been focusing all of my energy on moving into my own house. finally, on monday, i heard back from a rental agency saying that i qualify for a tiny, expensive, carpet-clad one bedroom house. $750 for 1 bed/1 bath, kitchen, living room, unfinished basement, wall to wall carpeting, and tiny yard. a tiny house. one thing in its favor is the location. it's about five blocks away from where  i live now, which is a fantastic neighborhood. also the rent is month-to-month, so i can leave whenever i want. ethan and bryan are moving in with me. ethan will sleep in the room and me and bryan will take the living room. that's $250 a piece. the deposit is $600, $200 being a non-refundable cleaning fee. i'm covering it (as far as i can tell). this whole thing may sound weird to you, but it's better than our current situation, which is sleeping in my room in shifts. now that bryan works graveyard, i never see him anymore. well i shouldn't say that, i see him for about an hour in the morning when he gets home before i go to work and for 45 minutes at night when i come home before he goes to work. our relationship is really thriving as you can imagine. so we need furniture, we need silverware, we need appliances. i have a car, a tiny tercel, and have started collecting things and bringing them home piece by piece. a long road ahead, i tell ya."

"event","i am really hung over. too bad i have to be on the ball today. i almost called in sick but then realized it would be a sign of alcoholism. 

everything was under control at the party until about 11 pm when people started leaving. leaving meant last minute encores, goodbye embraces, exchanged numbers. i don't think of myself as a jealous person but i found myself madly jealous of everyone bryan talked to. which is irrational. or is it. anyhow, i thought drinking more would make me feel better, and it did for awhile until i saw bryan on the porch lecturing a homeless man. i said, ""just because you were homeless for like a month doesn't mean you can tell all homeless people what to do."" that was the kicker. he shoved me hard against the wall and stormed off. i started walking down the street in the other direction. i got as far as the buffalo exchange before i sank down against the wall and started crying. i was crying there, i don't know for how long, when i realized someone was sitting a couple feet away watching me. i told him to go away. he said i should talk to him. i said no. he said he wouldn't leave until i told him what was wrong. i said my boyfriend pushed me. he told me i was too smart for that and deserved better. he told me that i should NOT go back to my boyfriend, that i should find someone who could take care of me. he offered to walk me home. i grabbed his arm and wrapped myself around him, crying and stumbling and apologizing. we made it to my front door and said goodbye. thank god, i was so lucky. it could have been anyone. i was really drunk and vulnerable, wearing a short skirt no underwear and high heals. we were all alone. just think about it. 

the main reason i haven't written in a couple weeks is things have been going really well. i'm about to get a raise at work. i have a group of friends i hang out with a lot and am in the process of making a few more... the makings of a real community. ethan, bryan and i are planning to get our own place. we'll see how that works out but i'm optimistic. so things have been really great."

"event","despite all the complaining that i've grown up too fast, there seems to be substantial evidence to the contrary. my housemate yesterday informed me that i was too intrusive, should not let my friends come over to do their laundry or hang around after i've left for work, and should not drink her vodka that's been sitting on the counter for weeks. she also made a comment about how ""boys stink men don't,"" in reference to my friends. how do i react. at the time i was apologetic and even obsequious. i shrunk down, held my elbows, looked at my knees and occasionally her neck. i really was sorry for being what she perceived as rude. it made me sad. i've been trying to be comfortable there, but even after a month and a half cannot suppress the urges to touch everything including all the soap, perfume, books, boxes, food, plants, alters, and hard liquor. i could understand where she was coming from but will never be able to come from the same place! i have the feeling that bryan feels the same way. we have a plan. my friends who live in a collective have a walk-in closet available. rent is $150 including utilities. we want to move there, together. the question is, if i move to a walk-in closet with my boyfriend of 1 1/2 month in an a. collective, will i be taking a step back or forward? i feel guilty, like i should strive towards being a boring adult just to prove to myself that i can. but it's stifling."

if i was in northampton, i would also be skateboarding. then i would call cherry st. at 4 am to see who was awake. depending on who answered, i would bring over some bacon and eggs (from cumbie's) and cook breakfast or chicken soup. then i'd bike to thaddeus and dorinda's and fall asleep on the couch watching the twilight zone. in the morning, i'd hitch to brattleboro, stay at McNeils all day, hang out in the pirate car, and end up sprawled out on the tracks with a permanent marker in one hand and a railroad spike in the other. eventually i'd make home despite roaring drunkenness and hook up with your housemate (the cute one). then i'd hook up with my housemate (the annoying one). me and rythom would steal geenie's car, drop a., and spill whiskey all over the passanger seat. what a mess! luckily we brought it back to her house before she noticed it was gone and that's basically then end of the story, unless you count the part when she called us the next day asking about the strong whiskey smell and wasn't it bad for the baby."

"event","i work with a stupid hipster named norm. and for all of you who take delight when something gets under my skin, may you contract a horrible rash because he is SO annoying. he contradicts himself, everything i say, talks in extremes (university of portland is the MOST expensive private school, university of wisconsin has the MOST students in the country), thinks he knows everything, and has nothing interesting to contribute to the world because he is ultimately stupid and lazy. what else would i expect from a 34 year old career barista who has worked at a place called ""wholesome friends"" for five years. it is demeaning enough to work minimum wage at a food service job, and almost impossible to do so with coworkers who are condescending and unfriendly. i will quit immediately if i ever have to work with him again."

"event","in case you were curious, here's a comprehensive list:

1. Professional Marketing Associates: telephone surveys for college students. Not a bad job when I was all drugged up straight out of college. Thanks T. 
2. Gibbs Oil Company: First great, then shitty, then ideal despite the paycheck. I still identify as a gas station attendant on some level. 
3. Herrell's Ice Cream: way too much work for what i was getting paid. why would anyone work there.
4. Full Sail Brewery: Helped with ""bottling"", which meant I took bottles off a conveyor belt as fast as i could and put them into boxes.
5. Expeditors: stacked boxes for the Xerox warehouse according to part number. got buff and bored to tears.
6. Allegra: worked in a music warehouse stacking boxes of CDs 12 high according to album and type. Met a lot of awesome Ukranians.
7. 1-800-REMOTES: Cleaned used remotes to send to people all over the country. I got fired for making ""mistakes,"" which only meant entering through the wrong door on my second day. Although I quickly corrected the problem, I still got fired. fuckin miluakie trash. what were they thinking, im practically god's gift to the working class!
8. Wholesome Blends: worked as a barista makin excellent lates for middle aged folks and their children. a really great work environment.

NOW:
Workin at a company doing contract work. Usin my degree. Buyin a car. Moving to the country. Spending lots of time with Ninon, Sihonn and soon Inkoo. YEEHAW, life is on track again. Just think, you too could be eight jobs away from your dream job."

of course, moving brings up other issues, like when am i ever going to see my friends again, what will happen to dan, wait but i haven't lived in boston or new york yet, what about my pet robot do you expect me to just leave that behind, etc. ultimately, i know that moving to the west coast is the ""right thing to do,"" i mean really look at my life here... i work late night at 7-11, i bike around, i pursue pretty women and a boy named dan, i read a lot but so what, it's basically lame. just think of all the great things i could be doing on the west coast. to be continued."

i watched twin peaks today. david lynch is brilliant at presenting events and creating suspense. the actual plot was dull. a homecoming queen addicted to drugs and eventually raped and murdered by her father... come on, lynch, you can do better than that. there are already a billion horror movies about killing and raping women, can't you come up with something original or at least progressive. when the media constantly portrays women as helpless stupid sex objects who get raped and murdered, it creates a hostile environment for women in the real world... for you and me! i guess movies where women fight back are unpopular or boring and obviously would never sell, but dorinda showed me one and i thought it was fantastic. the female blond trailer park hitch hiker confronts the notorious serial killer by grabbing his knife and shouting in a southern drawl, ""you want to fuck me when i'm dead? i don't think so! now put yer fuckin' hands on the steering wheel or i'll slit yer throat!"" i want to see that in more movies, david lynch."

i smoke cigarettes now. it all started with camel turkish jades. one day i was angry at work and wanted to try a new kind of candy. out of the corner of my eye i saw an emerald green pack of smokes with a cartoon camel on the front and thought, those'll be the ones. then i went to a weekend long party where everyone was smoking, and that's what did it. the habit turned into an addiction. i have moved from camel menthols to winstons, which are obviously marketed to granola cow girls who don't take bull, like me. the less racist american spirit. soon to quit as soon as i quit.

other bad habits i've picked up at my current job: soda. yesterday i drank three liters of diet coke. by the end of it i couldn't stop my hands from shaking and although i was exhausted couldn't go to sleep once i was off work. but oh, it was so good. and: subservience. dammit, i should stop being a customer's bitch and yell at a couple of 'em once in awhile, in the style of dan ward. otherwise i'll turn into... the arms, legs, and mouth of a machine. all you'll read in my live journal will be, ""i am mrs. gibbs, how can i help you? debit or credit?"" and then ill start dusting and restocking."

the trip to vermont went well. i got to meet nicolette's new boyfriend. he's not too bad fundamentally. but, you know. i think i pissed off her mom. well, you can't please the parents too much, or the new boyfriend. nicolette's the kind of girl who's ""too good"" for things, but it's actually true with her. she's the quintessential smith grad... intelligent, passionate, political, book smart, artistic, and very attractive. nico's too good for me too, but she doesn't know it yet. i wanted to spend more time with her but the boyfriend and mom picked on me the whole time so i left.

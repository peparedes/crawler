-the new britney spears cd wasnt what i expected but its pretty good.
-BYE BYE BIRDIE is over. im happy but sad. made some new friends. had some good times. fishcamp was fun afterward, stories.
-amandas birthday was fun. charades for hours, wrestling, hanging around with ""the family"" and friends. happy birthday

-he wrote about not being happy, posted scarian nation. ive thought that for a while now, that just proved its true. hes not happy. if it does this to me i could only imagine what that does to her, if she even realizes. i love you both
-to you, ironic isnt it...we've switched places. do you see it? do you still feel it? of course i'd do that. didnt mean to.
-i hope i dont end up feeling that way. my high ambitions get the best of me. i dont want to be like that when i get older. i.cant.i.wont."

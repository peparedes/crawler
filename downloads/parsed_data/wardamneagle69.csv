"event","One day, when I was a freshman in high school,

I saw a kid from my class was walking home from school. 

His name was Kyle. 

It looked like he was carrying all of his
books. 

I thought to myself, ""Why would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday? 

He must really be a nerd.""

I had quite a weekend planned (parties and a football game with my friends tomorrow afternoon), so I shrugged my shoulders and went on.

As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward him. 

They ran at him, knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt. 

His glasses went flying, and I saw them land in the grass about ten feet from him. 

He looked up and I saw this terrible sadness in his eyes

My heart went out to him. So, I jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses, and I saw a tear in his eye. 

As I handed him his glasses, I said, ""Those guys are jerks. "" 

They really should get lives.

"" He looked at me and said, ""Hey thanks!"" 

There was a big smile on his face. 

It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude.

I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived. 

As it turned out, he lived near me, so I asked him why I had never seen him before. 

He said he had gone to private school before now.

I would have never hung out with a private school kid before. 

We talked all the way home, and I carried some of his books. 

He turned out to be a pretty cool kid. 

I asked him if he wanted to play a little football with my friends 

He said yes. 

We hung out all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle, the more I liked him, and my friends thought the same of him. 

Monday morning came, and there was Kyle with the huge stack of books again. 

I stopped him and said, ""Boy, you are gonna really build some serious muscles with this pile of books everyday!

"" He just laughed and handed me half the books.

Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends. 

When we were seniors, we began to think
about college. 

Kyle decided on Georgetown, and I
was going to Duke. 

I knew that we would always be friends, that the miles would never be a problem. 

He was going to be a doctor, and I was going for business on a football scholarship.

Kyle was valedictorian of our class. 

I teased him all the time about being a nerd. 

He had to prepare a speech for graduation.

I was so glad it wasn't me having to get up there and speak 

Graduation day, I saw Kyle. 

He looked great. 

He was one of those guys that really found himself during high school. 

He filled out and actually looked good in glasses.

He had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him.

Boy, sometimes I was jealous.
! 
Today was one of those days. 

I could see that he was nervous about his speech. 

So, I smacked him on the back and said, ""Hey, big guy, you'll be great!"" 

He looked at me with one of those looks (the really grateful one) and smiled.

"" Thanks,"" he said. 

As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began 

""Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years. 

Your parents, your teachers, your siblings, maybe a coach...but mostly your friends... 

I am here to tell all of you that being a
friend to someone is the best gift you can give them. 

I am going to tell you a story.""

I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met. 

He had planned to kill himself over the weekend. 

He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home. 

He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile.

""Thankfully, I was saved. 

My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable.""

I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome, popular boy told us all about his weakest moment. 

I saw his Mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile. 

Not until that moment did I realize it's depth.

Never underestimate the power of your actions. 

With one small gesture you can change a person's life. 

For better or for worse.

God puts us all in each other's lives to impact one another in some way. 

Look for God in others.

And I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you.

Yore hair is like cornsilk, a-flapping in the breeze.
Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas.

You move like the bass, which excite me in May.
You ain't got no scales, but I luv you anyway.

You're as graceful as okry, jist a-dancin' in the pan.
Yo're as fragrant as SunDrop right out of the can.

You have all yore teeth, for which I am proud;
I hold my head high when we're in a crowd.

On special occasions, when you shave yore armpits,
Well, I'm in hawg heaven, I'm plumb outta my wits.

And speakin' of wits, you've got plenty fer shore.
'Cuz you married me back in '74.

Still them fellers at work they all want to know,
What I did to deserve such a purty, young doe.

Like a good roll of duct tape, yo're there fer yore man,
To patch up life's troubles and stick 'em in the can.

Yo're as strong as a four-wheeler racin' through the mud,
Yet fragile as that sanger named Naomi Judd.

Yo're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead.
You ain't mean like no far ant upon which I oft' tread.

Cut from the best pattern like a flannel shirt of plaid,
You sparked up my life like a Rattletrap shad.

When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack,
My life is complete; Ain't nuttin' I lack.

Yore complexion, it's perfection, like the best vinyl sidin'.
Despite all the years, yore age, it keeps hidin'.

And when you get old like a '57 Chevy,
Won't put you on blocks and let grass grow up heavy.

Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie, with a RC cold drank,
We go together like a skunk goes with stank.

Some men, they buy chocolate for Valentine's Day;
They git it at Wal-Mart; It's romantic that way.

Some men git roses on that special day,
From the cooler at Kroger. ""That's impressive,"" I say.

Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth.
""Diamonds are forever,"" they explain, suave and couth.

But for this man, honey, these will not do.
For you are too special, you sweet thang you.

I got you a gift, without taste nor odour,
Better than diamonds, it's a new trollin' motor."

"event","Two sisters, one blonde and one brunette, inherit the family ranch. Unfortunately, after just a few years, they are in financial trouble. In order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to purchase a bull so that they can breed their own stock. Upon leaving, the brunette tells her sister, ""When I get there, if I decide to buy the bull, I'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home."" The brunette arrives at the man's ranch, inspects the bull, and decides she wants to buy it. The man tells her that he will sell it for $599, no less. 

After buying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the news. She walks into the telegraph office, and says, ""I want to send a telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch. I need her to hitch the trailer to our pickup truck and drive out here so we can haul it home."" 

The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then adds, ""It's just 99 cents a word."" 

Well, after paying for the bull, the brunette only has $1 left. She realizes that she'll only be able to send her sister one word. 

After thinking for a few minutes, she nods, and says, ""I want you to send her the word ""comfortable"". The telegraph operator shakes his head. ""How is she ever going to know that you want her to hitch the trailer to your pickup truck and drive out here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her the word, ""comfortable?'"" 

The brunette explains, ""My sister's blonde. The word's big. She'll read it slow. - - - -

The truck's driver made her pull over into a parking lot and get out of the car.

He took a piece of chalk and drew a circle on the pavement. He told her to stand in the middle and not leave the circle.

Furious, he went over to her car and slashed the tires.

The blonde started laughing.

This made the man angrier so he smashed her windshield.

This time the blonde laughed even harder.

Livid, the man broke all her windows and keyed her car.

The blonde is now laughing hysterically, so the truck driver asks her what's so funny.

The blonde giggles and replies, ""When you weren't looking, I stepped out of the circle three times!""

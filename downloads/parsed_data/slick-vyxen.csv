This swing from an emotional inferno to bored to tears to this plateau where i wouldn't rather be anywhere else....all's as it should be and it feels fucking great."

"event","So this season makes me a drunken disrespectful asshole. Uncool. In the past week or so I forgot to call some of my dearest friends to wish them a happy holiday or what not...didn't buy 2 of my closest friends anything becasue the pressure of summing up our relatioship with a trinket from the mall makes me ill....but nothing is so much better right? Fahk. Just useless. PLUS I've spent nearly all my savings on trying to dull down my intense hatred of everything via the drink. I have so many bruises on my legs that my mom is steps away from taking me to the hospital and I have theis bizarre allergic reaction to god knows what which makes me wake up everymorning with lil obnoxious hives. So it is and so it goes. Plus the drama at my work is reaching the unfathomable point. It's incestuous, underhanded, and makes me feel like I should shower until my skin turns red and raw....and I'm not even reaping any of the fun benefits....just the clean up crew postion. the pinch hitter, the good for the time being kinda friend. Yeah. I love this shit. I'd rather be sleeping......
Am i really this angry?"

"event","My furnace has ceased to exist....so I'm in the basement with frozen toes and a warmth from double vod and crans that keeps pumping through my blood....thank god there's a cheap way to heat me. Although a thick duvet or a warm body I assume would be less expensive. Another day in the salt mines has passed and I keep fretting about the malls that I will have to endure to buy over priced gifts for my family and friends to over compensate for the year that I have put them though. X-mas is not a holiday geared towards good will to all human kind...it's a way to apologise with fancy wrapped boxes about how much of an ass you've been other wise through out the year...must start thinking hard about what to buy even though I keep landing on the idea of scratch tickets in a musical card. Yeah, I'm still an ass.TL you must be my wing man to endure this 3 ring of hell i call Conestoga Mall. My mom will drive us in a heated car and well sneak out the entrances to smoke cigarettes to quell my racing heart and mock all the other heathens that come out of the woodwork to buy their creepy children some playthings. You must. You must.
Phils was moderatly debaucherous, although my ladies spent the most part of the evening with theri eyes glued to the stairs as they hoovered their double rye and gingers for their fuck toy of the moment. It's nice to know you're friends don't think of you as time well spent when there's no boy to obsess over in front of them. Little do they know I'm more man than either of their kitchen flings. To hell with them. I had a good inebriated time anyways. New Years resolution...give more time to those who matter. No quitting my vices. They're there for a reason....
Please God. Send me a furnace for x-mas. Or an oil barrel to huddle around."

"event","SoOoOoO, I have someone intruiged with this blog of mine....I think anyone that's friends of a blogster has visons of themselves being cut and splayed across the screen in each update....when in the truth of the matter, we're all just having visions of grandeur. I think we like to blog becasue we all have the self masurbatory tendency to think that our ramblings are uber important....well I do at least. I've always been a fan of any kind of masturbating really. I'll take whatever I can get...
So yes, there's this boi who wants to get inside my head, even though he won't dole much of his head out to begin with. I think this is an unfair advantage. I may be ""over emotional"" and ""illogical"" or a ""woman"" but gawdammit,  I'm not giving it all away with no foibles to insult back with dammit! Tit for Tat or skid row bro. ;)
onto other news....my make up styings cannot cover my lepard spotted neck. Every love bite i get makes me feel like I was in the back of someones '62 Chevy steaming the windows up after they ""pinned"" me...when it's much more taudry than that....althought that's pretty good material....I may use that later tonite.

So tonite is a rendezvous with emily and Heather which shall be debaucherous at the very least. we're pre-drinking before Phils so that should be 'nuff said. Plus i need to scope some pretty ppl out becasue I'm doing my ""i don't obsess 1/2 way"" kinda thing these days, everyone has an escapist thing....the slightly out of reach is occasionally mine. SO cheap drinks, an excess of cigarettes, and short skirts....whatta night"

"event","Sooooo, this day has yet to end. My existance has been separated into 2 defined catagories, work and on my way to work...My social life consits mostly of coworkers, my wrists ache from the pumping of coffee karafes, i cannot sleep any night before 6 am from all the caffene absorbed through my pores. I can't remember the last time i haven't felt responsible for that place and i'm wondering what benefits i am truly reaping from this position. Sure, it seems like  I'm a hot commodity there, but, really now, for what purpose do i serve?? I dole out paper cups of the worlds worst legal narcotic. I'm a fucking pusher. A glorified pusher that wears a paste on smile to every Tom Dick and asshole that graces the doorway of the establishment. I bleed every ounce of effort and worth into this job to have, at the end of the day, backlash because my pants don't reach the tops of my shoes....heaven forbid i shouldn't look like a cookie cutter blond with big tits that brings the pedophiles back for more and more when they hate coffee...
*le sigh*
Onto other news, i hate x-mas. And i refer to it as ""x-mas""  because i find it amusing that the ""christ"" portion of the word has been replaced with an ""x"" Hi-fucking-llarious. i hate all of it except clemintine oranges, and drunk parties celebrating the fact that we made it through another year. Hurrah. Lets do another one, shall we? For shits and giggles? Why not. As need not be noted, I'm not someone you want to bring your children around at this time of year. I will try and incite youthful rage and rebellion. Or fuck them. Either or.
I heard the prettiest song just now. Sorta Sarah Slean-esque. love girl voices. Oh Frou Frou you have my heart right now. Real time love will pale in comparason. it's all about having to drain real emotions into a ravine of something so inconsequental and predominantly unworthy....*lol*
Could I become anymore morose and depressing?! all apologies. I'm not always this way, but thankfully, very near the surface I'm amused by it all....




And I'm high enough from all the waiting to ride a wave on your inhaling..."

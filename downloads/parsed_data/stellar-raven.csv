<b>Please comment if you&#39;d like to be added.</b>  Let me know who you are or where I know you from when you comment.

<b>NOTE #1:</b> I&#39;m happy with my friends list as it is now, however I would probably still add new folks as long as I &#39;know&#39; them from other places; forums and the like, or friends of people already on my friends list so that I have some idea who&#39;s reading my personal friends locked entries. That being said, if we have enough interests in common, I&#39;ll probably add you. I post a lot about my personal life, and therefore I don&#39;t add any and everyone. I&#39;m sorry.

<strong>NOTE #2:</strong> Please don&#39;t add me if you don&#39;t intend to comment on my journal or if you don&#39;t post entries in yours.

<strong>NOTE #3:</strong> Comments are now screened. (1/10/10)

Also, please feel free to watch <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/icons_by_jenn/"">my icon journal</a>. Those entries are always public."

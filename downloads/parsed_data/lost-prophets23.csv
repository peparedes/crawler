"event","So I haven't written in this for a while so I don't really know where to start... Hmmm I dropped out of my AP class so maybe I will be in classes with more of the people I never see this year... Yay we aren't little freshmen anymore!!! Well freshmen year was fun anyway.

Friday I went to Lake George for my friend Kristen's parents wedding. The wedding was on Sunday so Friday and Saturday we went on their boat and went tubing aroung the lake. It was a lot of fun. Pretty much all the time that we werent on the lake we were in the hot tub at the house they are staying at or playin pool which we both suck at. Friday nite Kristen played at this weird country bar which was scary and I dont really want to remember anything else about it. Sunday was the wedding and it was at the Sagamore which is really beautiful. Jennifer looked great and the reception was so much fun. Lots of dancing. Monday I came back home and went to the bowling alley with my sister to visit TJ and her boyfriend Mitch.

Tuesday I dont remember doing anything until I bowled at night... yupp Im pretty sure I didnt do anything. Wednesday I went to TJ's house and we went in the pool and played basketball which I was crushed at. Then we went downstairs and played pool (lots of pools) which I think I won 9-ball but that wasn't because I was good at it. After that we watched TV and went to the bowling alley (where else?)... I stayed with him til 8ish n went home n did nothing.

As of today Sara & Mitch have been going out for one month... congrats... awwww... tear.... j/k.

As of tomorrow me & TJ have been going out for six months... congrats 2 us lol almost...

Ok thats it... x1o4x3o... TTYL"

"event","Ok so this weekend was bad... Friday I went to Warren, Ohio for the Keystone Tournament of Champions. My parents changed the hotel from one that had an indoor pool (which they didn't know) to this other place that had nothing. Our hotel was in a city like thing where no one was on the streets AT ALL!!! What kind of city is like that??? The only thing that was at our hotel were pool tables so thats pretty much what I did the entire time I was at the hotel. Then that nice I was talking to TJ who I missed oh so much already and he told me more not so good news so umm yea I wasn't in the best mood. I bowled on Saturday and was really bad so since only the top 8 make it to the finals, I obviously didn't. I saw Paula for the first time since New Years so that was kinda nice. Next year I'm gunna qualify to go back and bowl sooooo much better... I hope... Warren was boring. Maybe Cleveland rocks, well Warren definately doesn't. Now I am home bored out of my mind, I just finished the People Magazine cross-word puzzle... so I'm done typing... TTYL"

"event","The Biology regents on Friday was the boringest thing ever!!! I finished soooo early and they wont let u leave early which is bull shit... the whole test is a joke. stupid state. Then I came home, got my stuff and went to TJ's house so we could go to Lake George for the weekend. Everyone's campers were so nice, i want one! So we went in the pool and then sat around the campfire til 1 in the morning was really funny... 

Then Saturday we went to Great Escape which is small and sucked... It was me, TJ, Nick, Mitch, Bobby, Anthony, Sarah, and Matt... I guess it was still fun but all the rides there are too small and too slow. We played volleyball in the sand with a monster ball which was kinda cool. Then we went back with 8 people in the car that holds 5 and ordered pizza. We sat around the campfire til 1 again playing the name game, we didn't finish we were just too tired to keep playing... 

Yesterday before we left we played volleyball again at the camp ground and Stefani rode Brandon's bike into the volleyball net and fell... It was pretty funny to watch and she wasnt hurt so it was ok... Then we came back and stopped at some rest stop where we got milkshakes... it was the worst milkshake ever, it was just milk, really gross. Then I went back to TJ's house for a little while and then to (where else?) the bowling alley. I didnt stay there too long but TJ had to work... probably fell asleep because I knew I was going to... That was pretty much my weekend... and I'm sick of typing now so I'm gunna go... TTYL"

"event","Only one more test to go, than school is really over!!!! Okay so yesterday TJ and I went to the movies and we saw the Stepford Wives, now for once we both agree on how it was.... it SUCKED!!!! Totally could not have been any worse and the most horrible movie that either of us has ever seen. So, if you are going to the movies and don't care what you are going to see like we didn't, don't see that anyway!!!!
After the movies my mom brought us back to my house where my parents decided to be weirder than usual and probably scared TJ and were even beginning to scare me... uh yeah. So then we went bowling and he was really good, and I was ummm ok I guess but not really good. Sam is also still mad at me so I'm still sorry even though I didn't really say anything but ok.
Mitchell was finally going to talk to my sister!!! awwww... but my sister was not cooperating at all. I'm gunna hafta talk to her about that. It'll happen eventually... Adam you can't go out with my sister!!!! lol pedafile (I don't think that's how it's spelled)

"event","Ok, so this weekend was pretty good... I have a ton of outlines to do now for my AP class becuz I neglected to do ne of them over the weekend. Friday nite was umm... interesting. All the Friday nite leagues are over so we all decided to go to the movies. Well besides TJ, who also likes to try to annoy me... its kinda like having a bunch of brothers... Well once again I was almost the only girl. JOY... Then Jess came with Bobby so that was the only thing that stopped me from being alone again. Anyway, they all said they didnt wanna c another girl movie so I said we could c Van Helsing. B4 we got there Joey told Mitch that it wasnt good, which Mitch (that rhymes) told every1 else who instantly didnt wanna c it nemore... We couldve seen sumthing else except nuthin was gunna start around the time Bobby n Jess were coming besides Van Helsing so we saw that neway. The ENTIRE MOVIE I had TJ n Mitch sayin, Steph this is ur fault. They didnt watch the movie at all, even enough to form an opinion that it wasnt good. Thats how much they will go by what Joey says, granted I actually tried to pay attention n it really did suck but thats not the point. We didnt get kicked out of newhere or even yelled at which I was surprised about... quite a shock.
Saturday I had my soccer game which was horrible as always. Again we didnt have enough people to play so we had to use people from the other team... not good. We ended up losing 2-0. More later"

So anyway, this girl comes over n man if I thought the other kid was weird ::whoah:: she is worse. Amanda had pretzels again and Caitlin went to shoot one at Amanda but instead it hit the weird girl rite in the forehead! wow that was funny! Then she started writing on the weird kid n then on his notebook, so I go is she ur girlfriend? N he says it would appear that way! That was pretty gross so we told Keli n shes like EWWWWWWW really loud, it was sooooo funny!!! N then Brent started sayin all this stuff like ""ask her if she has a dick"" and ""I wonder who the woman is in the relationship"" lol... Then when we were walkin out Brent goes have u ever seen the texas chainsaw massacre? n im like no so hes like well the crazy guy who kills everybody, thats who that girl reminds me of!!!!!! OMG that was the greatest lunch!!!!! LMAO.
Now I have to go write a f***in essay for my AP class becuz that is just so much fun n then do the outlines for that class, & my math n German hw so I can go watch Sam play softball against Ketcham. Ketcham is gunna lose again, thats sad.
Last nite at the awards thing it was really really obvious that John Jay gets everything... for example, Mr. Jutton called Ketcham ""the other school"" what the fuck was up with that? Their bands: sucked! N referring to Wappingers Jr. High as Wapp. Junior, doesnt that sound wonderful coming from a Van Wyck teacher, yeah they pissed me off. N for the records, Mrs. Simmons is anything but unbiased!!!!!!!! TTYL"

OMG a couple weeks ago I was runnin around back n forth like CRAZY!!! TJ & Laurel n pretty much everybody was like whoah Steph... n then I crash n can pretty much fall asleep in like one second. 
Last week I also had an English project that kept me from writing in this, n talking to every1 so it pretty much destroyed my social life.
Friday nite I had to go to Sam & TJ's confirmation... what a ton of fun that was... yeah rite! The dude made it take FOREVER!!! but it was ok.
Saturday was boring until I went to the mall with my dad n then I went to the bowlin alley... hot pink cake=good! & then I won a hot pink tweety football that I had wanted for a few weeks now! I was gunna spend all my money until I got it. Then everyone made fun of it. For example my dad ""what r u doing with that faggy football?"" ok it was funny but I like it! n then we bowled and lost first place which was very depressing... I still think it was my fault cuz I missed a couple easy things that cost us the game. We never win. I cried all the way home. That probably sounds pathetic, but it meant a lot to win with my dad in his last year of this league n now we cant. Yup so that kinda sucked.
Sunday TJ's mom drove us to the movies and we saw 13 Going on 30... it was ok. A lot of food ended up on the floor, but thats what those people get paid for. Then we went back to his house n watched sum more movies n stuff. It was fun. Definately the better part of the weekend.
OK thats the end of my weekend... TTYL"

"event","well today..
french class second.. it was definitly WTF MATE!! iw as pissed.

here is my vent for the day, all the sudden you have to get into partners for an assignment, like always and well there are us 5 girls in that french class, so one person is always the odd man out, kk well the first time it happend tor was away and just got paired with someone else, so it was fine, than the second time we didn't know what to do, so i was like okay w.e i'll just go with someone else and you all can be together, so today when it happend i thought someone else would go with another person, we would all like rotate and take turns. BUT APPRENTLY NOT! we all kinda looked at eachother and than tor just runs up to erin asking to be partners and erin said yes, than korey and i just kinda looked at eachother and she left bad i could tell, and than her and ray just paired up though, so i was completely like wtf. 

for me it just feels so weird to be with those girls sometimes, like julia is completely fine, i have no problems, rianka is fine but i miss how her and i were so close last year. than ray doesn't say much, so its a bit awkward, jessy is cute, korey i love her and same as erin, i love all them, but julia, jessy erin, korey and ray have all know eachother since forever, like jk. so its a bit weird at times cuz they will talk about their old times and when they took singing lessons like 8 years ago and shit. than tor i love her, but its weird, cuz we used to be best friends, now she kinda ignores me and like she pushed me aside for all the other girls, i dunno. so example, her erin and myself were walking a bit behind the other girls, and tor says to erin, 'hey erin wanna go a shortcut' so erin says yes and they just kinds left, like they wern't even like hey rach come or w.e or she didn't say hey GUYS. no it was hey erin. so than it felt awkward and i just tagged along but still like ? ahhh i dunno im just really upset about the whole situation and as much as i talk to tor about it, she doesn't understand and get it, oh well."

"event","in reguards to nicole's post here is a comment (it was too long so i made it into my post! haha)

thats funny. 
completely true though!
its like beating  a guy in poker or a sport, your not suppose to because your a girl and if you do beat them they come up with this stupid excuse for losing, making them a sore loser and just an asshole to you the whole day. like GET OVER IT! if a guy beats me on an exam or gets a higher grad i congradulate them i don't demote them, because girls are 'suppose' to me the smarter species, thats ridiculous. thats so sexiest, girls and guys are all equals.
but men like to feel like men, if you ever show them up (not even on purpose,) they can't take the defeat.

what i actually learned is that guys are a very sensitive species, even more so than women. a girl can shatter his ego so easily and rip him apart. where if a guy said something to us girls we would just say fuck you and move on, where if you said something to a guy, they would take it personally. so we have to watch what we say to guys and sometimes pretend that 'we can't do it' just to make the guy feel bigger, knowing that he can. 
guys will just never really ""get it"" and ""understand"" and the ones that do are gay. yet some guys actually get it a bit who arn't gay, if a guy understand women than he would have no problems ever in life. but sometimes they don't understand women they just understand a certain girl or women and thats good, but their clueless with the rest. and sometimes they just completely don't get it. 

example, my 2 best friends are guys, and they COMPLETELY get me, and i get them, so it works. but sometimes if they said something to me that was hurtful, that they wouldn't understand, i would just tell them what they did. because its no use for anyone to get mad when they don't know what they did, resulting in them getting angry with you and turning into this big ordeal. just tell them what they did and than leave it to them to fix it, if they don't than their an asshole and you can get mad, if they fix it than no big deal, there is no use wasting your energy being mad because they just don't get it, if they didn't get it than, they won't just miraculously (sp?)have this big apifany (sp?) on what they did wrong. sometimes were just so use to other girls getting us, that when a guy does or says something we expect them to make it right, but sometimes they can't and we have to recognize that and deal with it.

men will always be men. 
if you ever find a man who actually gets women, thats not gay and is single, 
NEVER LET HIM GO!"

so after that i got my dad to drop me off at cammy's house, brian was there too, it was so funny because were all really comfortable in eachother's houses that we just do whatever, so cam was teaching brian how to play this card game, and than they taught me, wow i owned them haha it was a cool game though a lot of fun, long thought. we played 2 games and it took like an hour. than brian left cuz he was doing something with will that night as well. after i asked alice (cam sister) if she wanted to play cards with us, she said yes and we played crazy eights. i lost! rats haha than we had hot chocolate yum, and we all sat at the table and talked (cam, alice, cam's mom and myself) cam left and went downstairs and watched basketball, while i just sat and talked to cam's mom and alice for seriously like an hour. it was soo cute! i love his family, and i love how im like 'in his family' where its not awkward to do that or w.e so we had a good talk, after alice went to bed and cam's mom put her to bed. (cam's bro, spencer and his dad where at spencer's hockey tournament and they won first, so they went out to celebrate woot haha) i went dowmstairs and cam and i just watched basketball and talked. hehe i love that boy! its so natural, i REALLY like him, and it made me realize it that much more. came home and talked to my mom and her friend (bev) for about an hour haha it was a nice talk.

so tomorrow i have to go to a  baby shower which i was really looking forward to, but now i don't even want to go, i have so much homework, i need to go to the mall, i want to hang out with cam and brian again or w.e and actually the only reason why i wanted to go was to see the americans  but now they all arn't comeing, only jared will be there, i want to see him but thats it. so its an hour and 30min drive there and back and we will only stay for like 4 hours maybe i dunno its just stupid. but i don't want to cause trouble or grief or anything so i will just suck it up and go i guess.

than friday is an early dismissal day, you know what that means, i GET OUT EARLY! free from prison. haha although i can't compare the two beacuse i have never been in prison, im sure its worse though.
anyway i get out at 11:45, its stupid to go that day as well cuz each period again is 30min but i figured im missing wednesday so i should suck it up and go friday. than after that were going to toronto for the raps game and dinner and everything

since the week before that i would've seen the americans the loversssss of my livessss. (haha good grammer!)i will be refueled a bit ..  and will have them to look for to, seeing them again.

lol march break was fun, but this weekend deffinitly topped it and made it that much better!

alright so basically the highlights include:

-seeing amy, jared, derek, damian (only for 5 min though) and danny and jessy (jared's friends)
- accidentially driving to london, in the opposite direction from the piece bridge. we drive 4 and a half  hours from where we were suppose to be :P
- singing to backstreet boys, getting trucks to honk their horn, and just being crazy
- almost getting pulled over when going across the boarder by the customs lady, she thought i was getting like kidnapped or something i think haha
- going to dinner at amy and jared's grandparents
- sleeping endlessy on top of eachother (amy, jared, danny and myself)
- going midnight bowling with like 12 people, from midnight to 3am, glow in the dark, bars, music, dancing on st. patty's day
- went horse back riding
- drove to rodchester, got lost (made a U-turn on the highway! haha)
- went out to dinner before the game
- jared, amy, derek, sean, danny, bobby and myself went to a bandits game (lacross)
it was the most intense game EVER! so much fun, jared almost got arrested, haha night hawks and the bandits are like arch enemies, but their were a lot of bandits fans it was about 3 to 1 (people)
- WE WON! 
- at the end of the game as well we all like jumped on top of eachother and fell over!
- on the way home, we ran out of gas on a highway at like 1 in the morning, it was cold, dark and we were by woods, it was SOOO much fun thought, i just felt bad for jared and the creepy man, but he wasn't creppy he was super nice and our rescuer, (so we should drop the creeper name) haha
- went down in jareds room, talked to him for like 2 hours stright while amy and derek sleep
- belgium walfs
- than going to up to sherkston, just being up there calms me down and i am/ feel like a different person. its summer, so warmth, the beach!, amazing friends, well family! fun times, so much to do. no curfew, bonfires, staying up late, no school/homework/catching up to do. dancing, singing, being crazy. man i can't explain it, its home, only place were i ever felt i really belonged. 
- driving back with my dad and telling him all my stories and what i did that weekend and how much fun i had!"

we had a good talk.
and at the end of all that he invited me over to his place
we watched the 4th harry potter (this has been like my 5th time in about 3 days!) haha but i didn't mind cuz it was a good movie and will really wanted to see it.
then after that we just went to his room and hung out, we played some music and just talked! it was soo great, i always used to talk to him so much (for at least like an hour a day on the tele) and then i didn't really talk at all with him for like 3 months. so it was good. 
we caught up
but mainly what i love is that when we are together its always like old times. 
so no mattar if we hadn't talked in years.
it will always be the same. 
so i think no mattar how far away times may bring us, they will always bring us back together again
after that wills dad drove me home, it took my about 4 times to get the stupid door closed, and even after the 4th time it still wasn't closed so i made will do it! :P...lmao im sooo weak! ahhhhh.
i got home at like 12:15 and after that i called jared and we talked for like an hour! haha

"event","its funny looking back on things...

you start to see things differently down the road.
then when you look back on the situation or past sometimes your feelings change.
and you really start to realize different things.
if for once you  were angry at someone and said some hurtful things.
the situation was resolved or not
looking back at that moment you start to really question yourself.
well for me, sometimes.
you start to see their points and feelings a lot better, mainly because your in a different frame of mind, your no longer angry and if you are then you have problems. don't hold grudges because all who gets hurt and messed up is yourself, becuase the other person normally doesn't care. so when you look back you see how you handled that sistuation, was it the right way or wrong way, you see in new eyes their opinion and feels as long as your own. was it stupid? worth fighting over? maybe that situation is why they treat you the way they do. maybe they went through a lot of shit. maybe they were just mad, and didn't mean it.
you start to wonder a lot of things. 

for me, i think i just realized how badly i hurt someone. 
its funny, because we've all been hurt, i have. badly too. 
and at the time i thought i was just being reasonable..
was i?
but what can you do now, its over.
the past is and always will be just the past, right"

that was the cutest lj ever! 
i love you so much!!
i don't really know what to say because i feel the exact same way and basically my comment said everything i wanted to, yet i still am writting this because i love you and wanted everyone to know it.

i love the way that you always speak your mind, even if that may be mean or hurtful, i would never have the guts to say half the things you say but your citisisum is always admired nontheless. your always there when i need you, always will be there too, i can always count on you and i know that. i trust you so much, and everything you say to me i always listen with both ears, normally your always right. i love hearing what you have to say about things, your opinion and just hearing your thoughts, you intrigue me. i love how we 'play fight' all the time! its so funny, we always end up laughing for hours. you and i are insepritable. i will always come in a package for two, with you (im a rhymer now i guess haha) even if we ever really get into a fight, its never anything its just words crossed for 15minutes then everything is fine again sometimes no apologies even needed because we just know we are sorry and never meant the things we said, we were just angry. we don't hold grudges or punish eachother for something they said or did that hurt another. i truely think your the only person i can do that with. 

i say to myself i can always forgive but never forget, with you, when we fight i can forgive and forget because you are my sister and i love you so. i can forget because it was nothing, nothing worth remembering i will always choose you over anyone, a guy, a friend. 

your truely my inspriation, 
my light
my hope      
my dreams
my passion
my world 
my heart
my angel
my best friend
my everything
my sister
my soul mate

i love you more than words could ever say, numbers could ever reach and feelings could ever share.

on the way home after school cam and i stopped at our usual spot and talked for seriously 2 hours. in that time i realized that wow i really do like that boy A LOT. and i know he really likes me. so why am i afraid? i know cam would never hurt me, and we would be really cute/good together. but honestly i have never been in a long-term relationship. im too scared. of what? i am not sure. and i know cam and i would last for awhile. but then comes the issue of we are best friends, so if anything happend then what? and then along came brian.. he is our best friend as well, so if anything happend it would affect brain as well, our little family, and the three musketeers we call another would be no more. also brian likes me a lot as well. and in a sense i like him too, i like came more but i still have stromg feelings for brian, after all he has been my best friend for 4 years now. and i wouldn't want to hurt him ever. i love him too much for that.

"event","getting better.

well okay im less sick which is always good.
but still feel so grose and not well
whatever though it will pass.

and the situation is getting a lot better as well. (matty, ty and i) hmmm
everything went to being completely perfect
to totally fucked up chaos mainly
to alright again
to messed 
and then now its better again and i think this is the last of it which is good.
haha oh well its stupid 
meh.

well lee bee is back. 
which is good
but i find its hilarious actually
as soon as lee got back my mom has been so happy
she home a lot more
makes dinners. like STEAK! 
doesn't yell at me very much anymore.
dunno find it funny but stupid.
when lee wasn't here seriously i thought of moving back in with my dad cuz all my mom and i would do is fight. we don't get along as well and i don't even really try to. she gets pissed at me for one thing and then goes around and does the exact same thing to me. uhhh i think i'll take hyprocrit for $400 bob. 
at least with lee here its another person so my mom is off my back. my mom was never really home, always working late nights. and therefore wouldn't make dinner until leee leeeee came...  (hahhaha)

im going out tonight though, to timmy's with matty and danny again. 
fun!
as always haha. 
leaving at like 7. then heading back to matty's after and watching the amazing race. haha wootsy. :P

anyway watching csi. 
night night

didn't get up until about 12. 
i could've slept in for longer, but decided i should get up.
i have been so tired lately 
i haven't been getting a lot of sleep much so it just has probably been catching up.

went downstairs and just watched movies the whole day. 
very entertaining haha 
its been a good day,
very sunny and bright. 
im starting to even get into my summery spirit
after all its my favourite time of the year!

"event","today when i woke up i left a lot better.
i looked at everything with new eyes and realized there wasn't anything to be sad about
so lin and i basically watched movies all day haha and pigged out! 
we were suppose to go to cam's but she didn't feel well (awwwee poor baby) so she went home.
then i chilled and then went to cam's house with brian for a bit.
it was cammy toes b-day today!!!! my husband and lover! hehe
we had a big party with his fam it was cute.

anyway this is what i really wanted to say...(a point in time where you all can really see how much brian cam and myself mean to eachother, we are the bestest friends, we love eachother so much, 3 musketeers as we always say. their the most amazing people i know, im truely blessed to have them in my life, incredible people they mean everything to me, dunno what i would do without them.) 

so we were all just chillen out together having a lot of fun like we always do, then all the sudden i dunno we all just got into weird moods. like we just kinda all got pissed at eachother, we just said some stuff and were doing stuff and then we would retaliate and that pissed eachother off. that went on for like 15min, then we all just kinda turned off all the lights and lied down on the floor. we were all arguing with eachother. we all got more pissed. 
at this point we just all shut up cuz we were so pissed.

THEN all the sudden brian says, rachel im really sorry, cam im really sorry, i love you both. 
i said, brian im really sorry, cam im really sorry, i love you guys, your my boys.
cam said rachel im really sorry, brian im really sorry, i love you.  
so then brian says okay group hug, cam and i were kinda like NO.. we were pissed still
brian says YES. i say fine and so does cam. 
we all are kneeling on the floor, picth black with our arms around eachother and heads bowed and touching for about 2minutes. the three musketeers. we just all started to laugh. and no one was upset anymore.

wow. i have the most amazing friends ever, everyone always rags on guys, but honestly i think there the better friends. their great listeners when your not talking to them during the big game. haha they hae great advice. their not judgemental. their so much fun. their is no drama, EVER. they care. and plus if girls were really pissed at eachother they would never really just apologize and have a big group hug like that and start to laugh. but thats how brian, cam and i are. we understand eachother. we know when something really hurt another and we always apologize, make things right and then make it up to them

IM THE LUCKEST GIRL IN THE WORLD!

anyway this is long enough.
i love you so much boys! 
your really my angels.
my inspiration.
night night

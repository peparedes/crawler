"event","I have been thinking about sin and remember the Bible saying even our most righteous is as dirty rags to God.  Makes me wonder, we must be blind to some sins, is it a cultural thing or are we just not mentally able to handle how we are if we see all sin?

On another note, I was gone for a while and when I came back EllieV is writing this GREAT ""Thoughtcrimes"" story and the first week there are three new chapters and now only one a week. I am dying here, Kraidydragon should write another ""Thoughtcrimes"" story, she is good at whumping.

Watched the first season ""Dexter"" this last weekend.  Loved it! Absolutely loved it!  Almost up there with SGA.  I fill conflicted though, should I like something that puts serial killers in a ""better"" light?  Even if he is only killing other serial killers, it somehow still does not seem right.  

Well those are my recent thoughts.  I will probably hibernate for a long while before I write again.  I keep forgetting that I have a place to put my thoughts."

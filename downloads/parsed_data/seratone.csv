"event","well today is an inprovment on yesterday. yesterday was a big over reaction day. see there is this chick i like, and my friend was going to ask her what she thought of me etc. and get back to me. and so all day i was fretting. and when i got home i went on the net cause he had promised to be online. and he wasnt. so my brain did its normal jumps to he avoiding me cause its bad news. and i spent the rest of the day upset. finally at like 12 he came online and i kicked my house mate of the comp so i could talk to him. and it turned out i had over reacted. she does like me, not sure if she likes me as much as i like her, but its a start.
and then today i got to talk to her again...sure i was helping her with chemistry homework but it was still good."

"event","this is my first journal entry...even though i signed up quite a while ago.
today was my third day of school for this year. suprrisingly i had an okay day. i only had <i>art<i/> and <i>food and hospitality<i/> today. 
we did are first actual art stuff, i got to spend like 2 hours drawing my pendulum. i thought it would be really easy...but no...i ended up drawing the entire room in the reflection. it turned out kinda well. i felt very insecure though, when the teacher came and looked at it because she is actually my auntie, and so there is alot of pressure for me to do well. but she liked it, so i was happy.
food was okay to nothin much happened, the teacher showed us how to make this ritcotta and white choc mouse with orange sauce. it was nice. id like to make it myself and try and change a few things, cause i think i can make it better.
however the day got worse when i got home cause my cat had gotten into the mouse cages and now we have lost two more, which makes 9 in total since i started school. we really need to change  the set up etc.
*end transmision*

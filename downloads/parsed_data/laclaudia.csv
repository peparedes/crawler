i dont have much to say.  thanksgiving was fun...a lot of food.  ok changing the subject.  i was just reading someones away message (which by the way i do to everyones)  i wont say any names but his sn says ""i wish i was dead"".

 so i went out to eat with danielle...my new boyfriend.  (im kidding you guys!)  but she could really just be my gf.  we go out togetehr...go out to eat...call each other a lot...and even exersise togetehr.  so anyway..this is where im going with the story...i love food!  i aboslulty love it.i cant enough of it.  i may eat little of some stuff and a lot of others but i mean i love food.  Madonna... i cant belive people are reading this.  i sound like a fat ass...anyway..i must go...LAW IS CALLING MY NAME...""claudia claudia claudia...""  o you hear it...ooo dio mio!  ciao tutti"

"event","<P>PLEASE EXUCSE MY LAST JOURNAL ENTRY! Reading that entry made me realize how retarded i really am when im tired. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>so how are you guys doing??? :-D me? well im doing ok. today kinda sucked. i woke up late, therefore i just HAD to skip my first class. hung out with people on campus like i always do and went to my 2nd class today...which is my absolute fav....at 2:00. o how i love econ...let me count the ways.... Its a whole new world in my econ class. for instance, a one hour and 15 min: class doesnt sound that bad in normal world...but once you enter the world of econ that time frame turns into 5 hrs and a half. Another thing i have notice:everything that deals with economics is out to get you. If finding the total cost doesnt like you either will the Average total cost, Marginal cost, Profit..ect etc. Whats even freakier is that our prof. isnt frm this country...we have no idea where she is from actually...FREAKY!! so i decided to print out our review sheet for our tuesday exam. which, by the way, i am going to fail. see, all through this class i have thought to myself that...yes! im going to pass this test...so this time im just going to accept the fact that i will fail and will eventaully have to retake it again.&nbsp;&nbsp; i really do hope this review sheet will help me.&nbsp; i need two b's on the net two trests to pass the class.&nbsp; i need a mircale!&nbsp; pray for me...to any god i dont care...just pray for me!&nbsp; </P>
<P>ANYWAY......before i start crying.....Danielle is coming home on sunday for like ever!&nbsp; i cant wait... i miss her so much.&nbsp; when danielle is coming home that means its not going&nbsp;to be that long till kelly&nbsp;gets her ass home too!&nbsp; GRAZIE DIO...things have been weird lately, but im not going to get into any details.&nbsp; </P>
<P>i have learned so many things this semester..more than any other semester.</P>
<P>1- just keep your mouth shut...even if that means helping someone out.</P>
<P>2- study and go to class...well just study more</P>
<P>3- tennis shoes are not always comfy...but they are cute!</P>
<P>4- lists are bad bad BAD&nbsp; hmmmmmm??</P>
<P>there is proably more but i cant think of anything right now.&nbsp; im tired.&nbsp; i seriusly dont get enough sleep at nite.&nbsp; i wait for moe to call me after work at around 12 and then after that im still wide awake.&nbsp; </P>
<P>What else can i talk about?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i really hope i dont come across as a bitch to people.&nbsp;&nbsp;i love how am so random at times.&nbsp; i seriusly hate writing these journal things.&nbsp; i always sound stupid. i cant type for the life of me and i never profread.&nbsp; i am just that damn lazy.&nbsp; o goodness...i just spotted the econ book...I HATE YOU...yeah thats what it just said to me :-(&nbsp; </P>"

"event","O what a lovely saturday.  It is 2:19 and my weatherbug on the corner of my computer screen says its a whooping  40*.  Gotta love OHIO.  Mind you, i just woke up 20 mintues ago.  
IM in such a pissy mood...i really have no reason to be.  (i think its me just pmsing.) it started at ryan's.  ali and moe act like 12 year old boys.  i just wanted to put them in seprate corners and make them think about what they did wrong.  THEY ARE SOO ANNOYING TOGETHER.  ""im sweeter then you moe""  ""no i am"" ""you're such a bum ali""  ""you dont know how to do anything either""  Ahhhhhh.

Then moe came over my house after work...ahhhh o well...hes so great :-D  i never spend time with him soo it was good, even if i wanted to smack him and tell him to grow up. :-)
goodness i have like 2 hrs to get ready for work...i need to shower, badly.  
i dont want to go to work at all.  i dont know, i dont hate it but its soo lame at times.  i hate most of the managers.  im just so fake with them. supposly i need to smile more.  AHHHH.  people are annoying.  

anyway........danielle was home a couple of days ago....the frat party was very very GAY...but our ""sex and the city marthon"" was great!! we started around 5 and ended at 1...of course i had to skip an hour to go home and  eat with my family.

i had a strange dream last nite....it was scary. i was all alone.  i dont know, it felt so real too.     
ok well im out...sorry that this entry was retarded.  ~BIA BIA~"

"event","Hi everyone!!!  This is my first entry to this ""cool"" diary thing that my cousin cristina introduced me to.  ahhhh  what to talk about. ? ??? 
well im freezing right now.  my feet are like ice and im nipping like no other.  i just saw brintays new video...she is hott!!!  gorgeous!  i mean not in a lesbianic way or anything.  (That illegal now anyway)  But on a serious note...i want her body...and angelinas face.  Yes people, this is what i think about during my free time.  
ummm..i saw my manger kelly today at the mall...totally parked next to her too and i totally didnt say hi to her.  then she calls me from work.  why??  i dont know...i erased the message before she even said anything...i hate work and i hate her voice.  ooooo breaking news...my hott sexy boyfriend got a day off now...o how fun!  
sooo today...woke up late...missed my first class but went to my second...i hate school...i absolutly hate it...i cant wait to get a real job and make real money.  Anyway, moe wasnt even in school..whcih was upsetting.  then i went to the mall and found nice ass shoes...boots that is.  Moe is afarid that they are going to look like those 'ugs'...but uh thats not my style and i keep telling him to stop fretting cuz they are nothing like them.  he aslo said something baout how dress urban...not the first time hes said this.  wierd!
  i love shoppinig...makes me feel so good.  haha thats such a shallow thing to say but its true.  i cant get enough of shopping...ill even buy ugly stuff and wear it and try to make it look pretty.  when i get older i hope to dress and look like carrie bradshaw.  im obessed with clothes and shoes and purses.  Luckly im not a big jewerly fan...
  i was annoyed all day...but im feeling much better ever since moe got that day off and that danielle is coming home at around 9 and its 8...WHICH REMINDS ME!!!  i have a ""cool frat party"" to attend to 2nite...im thinking about wearing a hoody and my black pants with the reebok...ILL PUT MAKE UP ON I SWEAR!  Is it bad that i want Moe to be more protective towards me??  or is it a girl thing?  haha i told him about the frat party and hes like oo cool have fun..NO WRONG MOE!!!  TELL ME I CANT GO!  then im like...yeah im wearing a hoody and hes like..""o...ok...""  with a confused tone in his voice...like hes surpirsed im not getting dressed up or something.  hmmm anyway...yeah im sticking with the hoody tonite...its super cold and i dont feel like looking ""nice"".
i also was thinking the other day how i hate YSU...well more like i hate living with my parents.  i wish i would have known what i wanted to do with my life in high school and moved right to NYC the second i got out of school...
worked as a witress or something or somthing in a music company...take some dance classes and try out for music videos....it would be sweet.  then i can marry my billionare italiano...sorry moe...but since i live here, ill marry moe ....:)  whoa...nooo.  

HOLY FUCK!  ITS COLD....  OK i have to get ready and look HOTT for those sexy frat boys...riiiite BOOOOOMM ITS ON!"

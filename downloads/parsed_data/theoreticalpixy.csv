Okay so THINGS, first I sent Chris and One out on a proper date

In the middle of the crowd behind them is a sim going into labor.  One helped her get to the hospital after she finished eating, which gave her a baby moodlet like you get when you give birth:

Burglars are really annoying. Chris never actually made is downstairs and Mo said 'eff this' and kept going back to sleep but Emily and One waited downstairs in their pajamas for justice to be served.

<lj-cut text=""still more sims. Lots of comparing faces since all the kids got aged up recently..."">

To start: Backtracking to Joshua! Because I seem to have completely forgotten about him last time. 

So when One went into labor she was out around town (she had been getting a massage at the spa) Phil was nearby and flailed:
<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=babyiscoming.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/babyiscoming.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

Then One walked herself to the hospital since it was only a block away. Oh One. 

Pike met her there, baby was had and little Joshua3 was born and they took him home. I think this was the first birth that Pike actually made it to on time. Third time's the charm.

So yeah, cute baby raising abounded.

I love this cap they just both seem so confused.

Around this point was their *first* move which was response to my game glitching up a storm. Hence confusion and forgetting to post last time because I was so annoyed at it.

Also Mo like to think about herself a lot. I don't know what this says about my sims.

Okay now the recent batch of things, newest house, and namely EVERYONE GOT AGED UP YAY!

First it was Emily's turn...

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=emilyteen-1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/emilyteen-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

This was her auto look...

 <a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=emilyhottie-1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/emilyhottie-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

And here she is after some styling. She is mostly a Chris clone. Oh man.

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=goodsister.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/goodsister.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a> <a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=cuddleswithmo.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/cuddleswithmo.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Helping with her siblings...

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=emilyguitarpark.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/emilyguitarpark.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

Asserting her independence by rocking out in the park. I haven't found a good potential boy or Girl friend yet but I am working on it I promise. 

And then I aged up bbJosh because holy hell newborns take too much effort. 

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=BBJOSH.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/BBJOSH.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

Check out that little stunner. 

His hair is technically gray (because Pike had some grey at time of conception) so I darkened it slightly but otherwise this is exactly how he popped out and since he's got a little Jeffrey Hunter going on I'm pretty gleeful. And the only Child to get Number One's eyes, lucky guy.

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=unclephil.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/unclephil.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

Phil was over to play One in chess(She is very close to her goal of being the top ranked chess player!) and he stayed to play with the kids awhile.

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=talkingwithtoddlers.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/talkingwithtoddlers.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

And then this happened which just made me giggle. 

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=teachjoshtowalk.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/teachjoshtowalk.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

He can talk and go to the bathroom by himself, walking is being worked on.

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=synchronizedparenting.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/synchronizedparenting.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

Synchronized bedtime! 

So then it was Moira's turn to have a birthday:

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=mocomaprison.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/mocomaprison.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Auto -> Final

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=dinosweatah.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/dinosweatah.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

Also she gets a dinosaur sweater for max gradeschool coolness point.

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=monyotahw.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/monyotahw.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

She had Nyota come over and they did hw like good children.

Chris is reading a romance novel called 'Commitment Issues'. I'm not even surprised...

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=fatherdaughterhugs.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/fatherdaughterhugs.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Awww


<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=relaxing.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/relaxing.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

Now that the children can mostly take care of themselves One is catching up on her reading. In her Underwear. Like a bamf.

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=bodyhair.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/bodyhair.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

And here's some gratuitous scantily clad Pike because the new update allows to give the guys body hair! So he totally got some. For accuracy. 

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/?action=view&amp;current=facecomparisons.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/sims/facecomparisons.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
For references since I am now far too intrigued by trying to figure out how each of the children will grow up feature wise. 

For the record Pike's eyes are gray, One's are blue (obvs), Emily's are hazel/light brown, Moira's are PURPLE and Josh has his mom's blue. 

idek how Emily & Mo's eyes happened. Sim genetics, man. 

Also I am kicking myself for not getting a good face pic of Emily as a toddler. 

In closing:

If you're on tumblr you've seen most of this. I'm sure it's a terrible burden to look at adorable sims so much. 

So Moira grew up into a toddler:

MOIRA PLAYS WITH A PONY. GOOD MOIRA.



ANYWAY, Moira can now talk, walk and go to the potty all by herself so now it's time to start trying for bb #3!

So, the parents Pike called in a babysitter for their two current bundles of joy and went on a date.

They toured the Military base and tried to be sneaky and try for a baby in the armoury.

They were not so sneaky:

But they survived the embarrassment to continue making out.

After returning home....

First sign of pregnancy! ACHIEVED

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/?action=view&amp;current=morewoohoo.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/morewoohoo.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
So of course they celebrated with more woohoo

Poor One was sick shortly after the woohoo. But it is okay because I'll send her to the spa soon and let her get pampered and happy for the pregnancy. Also Pike will give her lots of massages because he likes to do that. 


Oh and I made a My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic file. Because I have no self control:

Applejack and Apple bloom having pizza after their first night in town. As Applejack extolls the virtues of gardening of course.

To start off Pike is now Mayor, which means he gets a nifty new uniform for work:
<a href=""http://s190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/?action=view&amp;current=mayor.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/mayor.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
The sash kills me every time.

Pike and One's relationship has progressed quickly and amusingly. 

Cait and Phil have been pretty cute too
<a href=""http://s190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/?action=view&amp;current=massage.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/massage.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

and occasionally hilarious pervy:

Unfortunately their schedules line up terribly so they're very slow going. I tried a proposal and it failed because I hadn't established the relationship enough. But here's a pic let's pretend she said yes. Ok? Ok!
<a href=""http://s190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/?action=view&amp;current=fail.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/fail.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

Back to the Pike and One side of things:
<a href=""http://s190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/?action=view&amp;current=philcleaning.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/philcleaning.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
They cannot be detoured, even by Phil trying to clean their room. 

<a href=""http://s190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/?action=view&amp;current=byebyephil.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/byebyephil.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
They won out in the end.

<a href=""http://s190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/?action=view&amp;current=leaparms.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/leaparms.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
They did this on their own I take no responsiblity.

so after some dating 
<a href=""http://s190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/?action=view&amp;current=propsal.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/propsal.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
Pike proposed (so their names change how I want without me having to go to city hall, One actually wished for it first) ((LENSFLARE RING))

So they keep up with the cute and I split the house so Cait and Phil went go live across the street, thus making my game SO MUCH SIMPLER. I'm hoping they get married soon too. Fingers crossed.

Anyway, night before the wedding:
<a href=""http://s190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/?action=view&amp;current=nightbefore.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/nightbefore.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
awww.

Running out the door being late for their own wedding:
<a href=""http://s190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/?action=view&amp;current=leaving.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/leaving.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

But they made it and were adorable on the beach

<a href=""http://s190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/?action=view&amp;current=rings.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/rings.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
And now they're married!

<a href=""http://s190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/?action=view&amp;current=wife.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/wife.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>
and everyone coos over One. Who had to run to work an hour later but OH WELL, it was then or wait like 4 game days (their schedules are odd).

LATER. So I hadn't actually managed to get either couple to woohoo so Pike & One got to woohoo on their wedding night for the first time.

I find the lead up hilarious so here:
<a href=""http://s190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/?action=view&amp;current=prewoohoo.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i190.photobucket.com/albums/z23/pixyglitz/SIMS/prewoohoo.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

FINALLY.

Next up redesigning the house and BABIES. 

I also finally made a me!sim in a side game:

<lj-cut text=""AS IF I DIDN&#39;T ALREADY SHIP IT...and other general awesome"">

Firstly, Pike is badass and I love him:

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/pikeone/?action=view&amp;current=comics.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/pikeone/comics.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

Number One is also badass (Pike has just been stolen by ~aliens, this is seemingly her first time in the chair):

Also they share a brain and I love it, plus awkward!One:

Okay so this is Cusack, Pike's (doomed) yeoman, who is a bit pervy, so therefore I cannot read that '<i>Eh</i>?' as anything other than implying Pike and One are a bit  ~close.

<a href=""http://s288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/pikeone/?action=view&amp;current=comic2.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll197/strawberryfields38/pikeone/comic2.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>


I may have to post some bits to <lj user=""pike_numberone""> or something if it keeps up. Pretty much everytime they share a panel I end up squeeing. 

JUST UGH SO MUCH LOVE.

EDIT: AND NOW A BUXOM BLONDE ON RIGEL IS OBVIOUSLY FLIRTING WITH HIM AND ALL HE HAS TO SAY IS 'Uhh'.

Cait and Phil. They are dating and sort of hilarious. Cait fixes things, fishes, and dances a lot. Phil CLEANS ALL THE THINGS. And reads. They're schedules don't match up very well but I'm sending them on a date next sim night because it's Cait's day off and Phil wants to go to the symphony.

This is an average night at the Yorktown house. Number One has a tendency to start exercising right in front of wherever Pike is sitting.  He's usually oblivious. Cait is dancing though it's hard to tell here. Phil is sleeping in the background because he is grumpy and does that.

Number One's thoughts immediately after showering.  I call this a win. 

I was clued into the code to get lots of money today so the house now functions much better and there is room and things (THANK GOD). Next on the list is a second bathroom. 

They also live next the Kirks who are married and I am hoping pop out a little sim baby soon. *plot plot plot*"

my dad found a new anteanna for my tv and it works! I have channels! That aren't fuzzy! I can watch Glee on time! 

I haven't had a channel receiving tv since I went to college due to the dorm setup, minneapolis' broadcasting tech and that I am far too cheap for cable when 90% of anything I want will show up on hulu a day later. Whenever I visit home I tend to spend a day in a blanket on the couch watching tv right away. I don't *really* miss it (otherwise I would have caved for cable long ago) but it's sort of terribly exciting to be able to get tv again.

I'm pretty energized despite complete ruin of my sleep patterns, I reorganized the kitchen on monday and am tackling my room next (hopefully with large pile of things to toss in the trash/sell) because I always come back from the holidays with too much stuff. I've got some dolls I've been meaning to sell anyway.

Also popping out fan things like a fiend. (Though not the apocabigbang because I am useless like that) I have a full rough of a Jasper/Alice vid that appeared in the last 48 hours and no one's allowed to shun me for that. 

also getting addicted to the <a href=""http://www.deargirlsaboveme.com"">Dear Girls Above Me</a> guy. 

I have sea creature silly ringz and there are little pink octopi. Cannot resist tentacle jokes.

OH! Also I finally figured out which song a particular riff that always gets stunk in my head is from! (Time to Pretend by MGMT) It's literally been reoccurring for a good 2 years. I'm not even surprised it's a hipster song. It was pure luck, someone recced a playlist that had it. It came on and I was like WAIT WAIT THIS IS IT! It was exciting.

The other...well I'll figure out something.

Marry:
Topher Brink

Okay this was the hard one. The whole bunch are highly flawed characters, which could I actually handle marrying is a bit of a tossup. He's seemingly edging on amoral but he does not have the same reckless hero thing as the other two plus considering his end it's clear he's not completely incapable of emotion and morality. Also he's adorable and I like geeks. So Topher wins! 

Do:
Wolverine/Logan

Like you wouldn't. That is a chance I would not turn down.

Dump: 
Sirius Black

I love you Sirius, but your heart belongs to Remus. Plus you kicked it at like 35 and all your friends die.

"event","Hokay, so <strike>here's the earth</strike> I have been ~thinking about nanowrimo. 

Was intending to skip. Figured I'd rather use it to work on blacking out my <lj user=""schmoop_bingo""> card, shorter requirements, it's highly self indulgent and happy making etc.

Still doing that. Though I'll be doing a 'finish a prompt every 2 days' and go into december. Easy (also have to keep reminding self that dude, I art and vid and graphic and making myself write for them all is just cruel. I can pop out an icon set in an hour. So yeah)

Here's where I am getting tricky. 

So instead of actual nanowrimo I'm going to do an art version. I've been wanting to expand/redo <a href=""http://pixyglitz.deviantart.com/gallery/#Comic""> This</a> comic for awhile. 

I'm going to. I'm going to nose to the grindstone and produce a fuller and longer version that I could potentially (hopefully) actually shop around to publishers. 

I'm going to figure out a schedule and there will be a lot of planning involved but damnit I have the time and if I ever want it done I have to do it now.

The only question left is if I go straight and just keep working on the little mermaid or if I use a different story. I'm rather tempted by doing sleeping beauty ngl. 

Possible both? Make a set type thing (That would take much longer, but still)

In conclusion:
I am crazypants
I have an addiction to fairytales
I am going to produce more art in a month than possible every before in my life (... actually I might not. But shhh, it'll be intense)

also I'm signing up to write for <lj user=""apocabigbang""> as soon as I settle on fandom. And have already signed up to do art or mix. 

When it rains it pours. Or something like that....."

<i>Out of utter curiosity, if I was chained up in your attic (I prefer attics, basements are damp and cold, attics theoretically at least have windows), and I had to write you one story, what would you request? (demand?) Or alternatively, what's something you always hoped I'd write but know is never going to happen?</i>

I'm on a writing spree today so it might actually happen (tomorrow there is going to be porn!). 

And quick list:
1. finished second bb piece. (technically 5th)
2. blah blah Author blah.
3. I want to see Red so bad but my discretionary $10 this week is being saved for Paranormal Activity 2 this friday because that will be worth seeing with an audience for full freakyness.
4. My face hates me."

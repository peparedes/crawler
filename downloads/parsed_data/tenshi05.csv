"event","So, my computer has been busted for a couple weeks and now it is finally fixed again.  I miss my husband, where the hell have you've been?
  I have been in such a great mood this past week, it has been awesome, yet, really wierd at the same time.  Been working my ass off and now getting ready to pack up my whole apt and do another move...what a pain in the butt.  
  I have a date next Friday that I am also really nervous about.  More like butterflies in my stomache, so many that I want to throw up everytime I think about it.  Haven't been on a real date in ages...and if someone told me that I'd be going on a date with my Rockstar to His show, I would have not believed them...we'll see how it goes.
  Tonite going to be in the city watching Cole play at Bar 169...come out if anyone wants to:)"

One good thing thou, out of all this craziness, I still managed to have met my ROCK Star...good friend to have if not anything more."

"event","Happy 420 to start this entry off, it has one month and one week since my last livejournal entry.  Sorry about that but I have just been busy and havn't really had the time to update.  Finally it is getting warmer and finally no more SNOW!  Spring officially arrived March 20th, just happens to be the day after I got involved with you:)  My Harry Potter you were so much better in my dreams and when I could just imagine the things we would do together...who would have ever thought that you would end up being such a jerk.  
  However, a guility concience does get me good hook-ups at Blue Ribbon...lol.  But that was so over pretty much a month ago...or it never even began.  Now YOU, though, you were def. not a mistake and def. something I cherish.  It has been a month exactly since we first started this non-relationship and let me tell you I have never been happier with a non-relationship.  Usually by this time I am running away or wondering where this is going, but this time it is just different.  I think because I know that whatever happens with ""us"" we'll alwayz be friends...and that is all the security that I need.
  Califoniria is looking more promising each cold day that goes by...now I have someone who wants to move too....DON'T DISApPEAR ON ME BEFORE THEN...you know who you are miss sudden
 depature...
  This endless nite has been good, nothing like spending it with a few close friends and part of it with some good friends...it is good change from spending it with, you know...not that I don't enjoy every sec. we spend together but I need to show my friends love too:)  
  Okay enough for this entry, I'll try to keep on top of this journal thing and keep updating...
  Hey, friend, that keeps ditching me, you know who you are...I know you still read my journal at least so at least you know that am still alive and well:)
  Apparently that has become the question of the year ""Where the hell did this girl go?"""

<TR>
<TD>Based on the results of this test, it is highly likely that: <BR><BR>You prefer your romance and love to wild and daring rather than typical or boring, you would rather pursue than be pursued and, when it comes to physical love, your satisfaction comes more from providing a wonderful time to your partner than simply seeking your own. <BR><BR>This places you in the Lover Style of: <B>The Liberated Lover</B>. <BR><BR>The Liberated Lover is a wonderful Lover Style, and forms the kind of free-thinking, sexually-exciting, self-confident lover that society once condemned but that a liberal-mind cherishes and exults. The Liberated Lover is a treasure to find, though it can sometimes be difficult to do so because they are often already engaged in relationships or are in high-demand if ""in the market."" <BR><BR>In terms of physical love, the Liberated Lover is possibly the most thrilling and demanding of all, with the one potential drawback being that it is possible to feel 'overmatched' at times by their prowess and selfless giving. Given trust and understanding, and the right lover, the Liberated Lover can be a delight in bed. <BR><BR>Best Compatibility can probably be found with: The Exotic Lover (most of all) or the Carnal Lover, or the Suave Lover. <BR><BR>Congratulations! <BR><BR>If you enjoyed this test, I would love the feedback!

<P>Cute, neither Dark nor Light, and Artsy, the Art student doesn't have the inherent darkness of the Suicide Girl, but she's not bright and shiny like the New Age Girl either. You've probably seen her wandering around town in her unique outfits with her portfolio under her arm, and found yourself wondering if she's ever posed in the nude.</P>

Since my last blog entry nothing much had happened to me.  Been spending a lot of time working and also with my friends...Def. enjoying the single life.  Exams are coming up and next thing we know it will be Thanxgiving already, amazing.  I finally attempted to clean my apt today.  It seems like even though I clean there is just so much more to clean.  Things get buried and consumed in my apt, including people...lol.  Just thought I would check in and let people know that I am alive and well.  Stay warm!"

  Just wanted to let everyone know that I am alive and well.  Although freezing my toes off I am still alive and kicking. 
  Summer was great.  Spent till the last week of July in NYC, working and spending time with friends.  Spent the last week of July in L.A. with the folks then went home, my bro came back too, so that was fun.  Lots of family time.
  NYC has been great...even though I am sick of this city by now.  Going on 6 yrs, I have never stayed this long in a city before...Cali is my next stop, after college, anyone else wanna come?
  I am taking my last two classes and also working.  I think that about updates everyone...more to come I promise this time."

I am so tired so sorry if I am writing like a complete moron.  I haven't had any sleep since school started up again.  
  The last weekend of Spring Break was actually nice.  We went up to New Paltz and I fell in love with that village and it is so pretty, if you haven't go visit there at least once.  You can go see the house in the mountains where Stephen King wrote ""The Shining"".  It was good to get out of the city as well and spend some time running free about the country:)  Such a historical Village as well.  I have been so tired that I haven't been able to update so here I am doing just that.
  Today was a great day.  At schoolwe got to have our Asian Heritage Month event and we pulled it off, it was amazing and everyone came to support and the performances were awesome.  Wish you all could have been there.  It was a program with historical and cultural presentations.  I am so happy that all my friends pulled through and came out and brought there friends too:)  I am exhausted now so I am going to crash...I'll try to be on soon to keep everyone in the loop."

  I haven't been able to write much in here because you know life gets busy and then I forget to update journals or anything.  But I have been able to keep in contact with my friends and a lot of them have been complaining that I don't write in my LJ so they don't know what the hell is going on in my life...lol.  Well, let me see the last time I really wrote in this was way back in Aug when I was still in Shanghai.  Since then I have been back in NYC and have been really busy...btw school, student gov't, NYPIRG, work, and of course lovefatmusic.  I was reading some of my earlier entries and I remember thinking at one point if I could ever commit to just one person...well, the answer turned out to be ""yes"" been with the same one person for officially over 9 months and unofficially over a year now.  We have had our ups and downs, then again what relationship doesn't?  But overall it has been great.
My Student Gov't term is over on June 30th and I can not tell you how glad I will be when it is.  We had great times and got stuff done but really it took a lot out of me.  I don't know that if I ever will do it again.  I will return to NYPIRG and start doing more work with them since for the past yr I have backed off a lot because SGA took up most of my time.
  I think that about brings everyone up to date.  Still with lovefatmusic, SGA, NYPIRG and school.  I will try to update my LJ more often now since I have a laptop now it'll be easier to do.  Peath and stay tuned readers, more to come soon.
OH YEAH, I GETTO GO SEE MY JIMMY FALLON TONITE...GO RED SOX!GO JIMMY! GO DREW!"

If I had known that it would be like ""sometimes quirky, sometimes funny, and sometimes sad,"" and that my LJ would give you some new insight into what goes on in the minds of a woman I really would have kept up with my LJ.  I don't know, man, what goes on in my head could not always be a good thing.  I sort of have  TENSHI05-BRAIN that doesn't always think like a woman sometmes I am just crazy, but I do thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.  Our friendship has been an interesting yet great friendship.  I would not trade it for the world..and lucky you, you get to be the first entry to 2005...I hope not the last as well.  I much rather give you insight in person than through LJ but I am going to try to keep up.  You are awesome and sometimes you really don't need to know what goes on in a woman's head.  Remember men are from Mars and women are from Venus, we're not supposed to understand each other or know exactly what goes on in each others heads.  We are just supposed to tolerate each other and accept the difference.  I think everyone should jsut accept people for what and who they are.  Hear that women, stop trying to change your men, it's not going to happen, let them be who they are...what do you want a boring man?  I bet if every man changed to be what women wanted we wouldn't want them any more.  Then you would hear a bunch of complaining, lik e""oh my goodness, he doesn't even think for himself""  I will continue to give you love and advice until you don't need it any more,  Nagashimon, which I hope is never:)  Thank you once again you know I don't deserve this...love yas peath out!"

You know it has had its ups and downs but more ups then downs of course:)
  Since I have had much time by myself here in Shanghai, I have evaluated the true meanings of friends.  I have made a decision that those people who claim to be my friend but are not have no purpose in my life no more.  Also that no matter how much this particular friend keeps on ditching me he is def. a true friend, anyone who can blacklist people just because I have asked them to is def. great in my book.  Those immature boys, cuntrags, and whore bags can just kiss my ass!  That is really all I have to say on that matter.  Esp. that fucking whore bag, she needs to return my shit and get the fuck out of my life:)
  I will try to write more this semester.  It is def. going to be a busy but fun sem.  Student Gov't, six classes, NYPIRG, and of course work when there is time.  Not to mention lovefatmusic;)  Enough for now will write more at a later time.

I got the second to highest votes so i am extermemly happy about that.
this past month had been crazy...campaigning and working hard finally payed off.  on top of the the ""love of my life"" finally confessed to me his feelings and u know we have been building since then.  but i don't know how it will work.  we have been friends for over 3 yrs and it is really hard to transition into the ""girlfriend"" ""boyfriend"" stage of our relationship.  but it is great to know that we get to go through this together and with each other.  i wouldn't pick anyone to go through this with other then him.
i have been slacking off in my school work so the next two weeks basically will be spent catching up and making sure that i finish this semester with a bang.  also i have to register for summer session 1 classes.
this weekend has been crazy.  finally got to spend sometime with my brother and his gf then went to the magic show like i do every friday and met his father, that was fun, hung out in manhattan then back to brooklyn.  yesterday did some work and then hung out with my ex, the one i was suppose to work it out with but u know we haven't been able to have that talk...confusing.  then went to a movie and hung out with some friends...cool peoples.  
this past month has been crazy.  what is up with the guys in my life, why do they feel to make a move on me all at the same period in time...crazy mother fuckers i tell ya...so yeah can i ever commit to just one person?  hmm...i believe if the love of my life really wanted to work things out that maybe i'd be willing to call is off with everyone else and just be with him...we'll see..."

  it is crazy how time is just flying by so fast.  it already is almost the end of feb.  11 more days basically and is is the last day of the month.  this yr. is yet again another leap yr.  wow, time flies.  in about two weeks NYPIRG we leave for albany for conference, it is insane.  my first exam is coming up tomorrow for my psychology class.
  it was so cool yyesterday i got to spend some quality time with an awesome chick and it felt like old times again because she actually came all the way to brooklyn to hang out with me.  it was great to sit and talk and just enjoy each other's company.
  in DC i slept so much and for many hrs.  i mentioned that to this chick and she said something that made a lot of sense to me ""you always feel more comfortable when you are not home but sleeping in someone else's house""  kind of like your home away from home, i guess.  usually i can't sleep when i am home in nyc of china or at someone else's house but i don't know in dc i passed out and got caught up on my sleep which was of course the best.
  well, i am going to get ready to start my long ass day and hopefully i will be able to write some before i end the day, but we will see.
  i feel like i am fally behinde in all my NYPIRG work becuase i am always in class or oding school work:(  oh wells i'm sure things will work out.

"event","so i finally got all my books and art supplies for class.  i had forgotten how much i wanted to become an artist and how i love paint and clours, wow.  so many things i have blocked from my memory and now it seems like they're all coming back and that i am actually dealing with them and so forth.  
  my bro comes back today from shanghai.  it is cool, its going to be like life totally just getting abck in gear of nyc.
  my first week of classes finally done and it seems like i will be able to survive this sem.
  i totally wanted to kill this cab driver today because he didn't know where the hell he was going.  i told him he was going the wrong way and he had this fucking accent and oh my goodness he was trying to correct me on pronouncing greenwhich street. what the fuck?  um, i know i have an accent but i think i would know how the fuck to pronouse the street which i go to almost every day for class.  get a fucking life.  u know it is like if he didn't know where to go in the first place he could have just been honest and told me.  if i wanted to be half an hr late to class i would have just taken the damn train!
  but yeah buying my art supplies made me happy and now sitting here in the nypirg office just u know catching up with people and labeling my art supplies, i don't know just makes me feel good.  i must be really fucked up in the head then...lol.  whatever, u know i am me, it's like take me or leave me and i don't care whichever the fuck one it is.  so i have to go and get one more tube of orange paint so lucky me i can do that before class on tues.
  good news, i'm going to DC on thurs morn so i getto get out of the city and take a sort of vacation for about five days...woo hoo!
 well, enough here.  maybe more later or whenever"

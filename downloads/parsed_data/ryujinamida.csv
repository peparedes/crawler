"event","So I finally finished my third day of work. I really do enjoy it so far. I really really need a vest that fits me though. It's so irritating. The extra one they had is like a 2XL, and I am just swimming in it. It makes me feel ridiculous. Like a little kid. Which, is only made worse by that I know nothing training feeling. Although, I still really do enjoy it. Every one I work with is very nice, and I'm really glad to be doing something again. Nervously cleaning the house just wasn't doing it for me as entertainment for oh 8 hours a day. Now all I need to do is manage to get my sleep schedule under some semblance of regularity."

Also, the green bookcase I did I'm very pleased about. That's about all the new house news. Other than the fact that my bed is the new cat bed, apparently.

In other fun Furniture related news, I have to move all of my newly aqcuired furniture out of my grandmothers garage... tomorrow. Hooray! I get to take all of it home, and then I get to lug it all the way back down there.&nbsp; My family decided they couldn't close on say wednesday, or give me till next fuckign Saturday when I will have it all moved out.

I wish the damn thing wasn't that late, but what can you do about it really. Also, this key board I'm using is not.... configured to my hands very well. It is rather upsetting really. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what I should talk about on this. I haven't managed to update this stupid thing in way to long. Forgive my lack of diligence. FORGIVE IT!!! That said I read and finished Elantris over break. It was very entertaining. Looking at Brandon Sanderson's stupid site makes me feel like a failure as an author. Which reminds me, I really should be working on spoon donkey, and will probably get on to doing that after this. The community where I am a failure as both an author and an artist. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Went and worked out and got Pho with Katsu yesterday! mmm Pho. I must say the experience was a delight, even if I should never be allowed to consume that much food. God help my stomach, but it survived the strain. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fun and exciting life news I'm looking to move out in June! I would love to get Erin to be my room mate, but she remains elusive, and uncooperative. Curse her!

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Me ranting!"">&nbsp; I have to be convinced that this year is just building up the abnoxious shit so that at the end it can be really spectacular. I mean winning the goddamn lottery spectacular. For those of you that haven't been talking to me all that frequently my grandmother Goomba (Rosalene) died last Sunday in hospice. Which, she should have been at home, but I only have my stupid aunt to thank for that. I hate hospics, and will be angry with her for that for a long time to come. And, yet it my other aunt is who I'm even angrier at. I can understand the one though she was doing the right thing, and even though I vehemetly disagree with her I can understand that. My other aunt however at the funeral service pulled something I can't honestly believe. So, my mother and sister make a slideshow of all sorts of family pictures to play at the funeral. They were told that the place wasn't set up for that. Then during the service there is a slide show of pictures. Well that in and of itself is kinda sketchy, but wait it gets better. So, there is no family in the pictures with my grandmother just people that she worked with for 30 odd years which is fine, and then the very last slide is my stupid fucking aunt and my grandmother. That's it! she was the only family in the whole thing! My grandmother didn't even like this women(she is the wife of her eldest son). So, the burial is on monday (today now), and I will have to resist the urge to put that women in some unmarked grave while I'm there. Also, she was the only family member who spoke at the funeral for some reason. Read some damn biblical passage whoo ha that nobody gave a damn about anyway. Stupid vapid whore.</div><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, now that is off my chest... I have been playing a lot of disgaea lately that game really has no right to be that much fun. I have been reading like crazy, and just finished mistborn by Brandon Sanderson. It was a pretty entertaining read, and I would recomend it. I mean his name illeterates! it's reason enough I tell you. The website is<a href=""http://www.brandonsanderson.com/""> this</a>. I will now have to read those short story anthologies I picked up when I went to the library. The best of the best science fiction so far is very promising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am so glad that it is spring break! and now I think I'm going to scamper off."

"event","I'm sitting here at school and instead of doing something responsible that even resembles work I'm reading webcomics and looking at live journal. I totally don't feel like I am done with school, and I wouldn't know spring fever if it bit me. Unfortunatly, I fear that spring fever has bitten me... Hard in the face. I'd be more upset, but let's face it the teeth marks can only further distract from looking at the face as a whole, and that can't be a bad thing. 

     As for that rant about day light savings time, or stealing an hour of spring! I love spring and hate the fall. So this constant demand to steal an hour of srping and replace it with an hour of fall to me is monstrous. Not that in all reality it actually changes the amount of either season. I do appreciate the light later in the day, but trying to get up in the morning when it's dark out was damn near impossible this morning. I find the history of how daylight savings time came into being to be particularly humorous. If anyone ever tells you it was to benifit the farmers they are filled with lies. In all actuality daylight savings time hurts farmers, but it is great for retail. Now the arguement is that it is good for energy efficiency. Which, I  suppose makes sence how many people are up at 7pm vs 5am? 

     Well i better get to doing some ""fake"" work. stupid spoon donkey. This drawing portion is killing me! Mostly because I can't really draw."

That was fun, and we need to get together, and hang out more. The Black Donnellys is so hot! Also, I enjoy the show for it's other merits as well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just finished Neverwhere, and I'm not sure how much I liked it. Don't get me wrong it was a very enjoyable read, but something about it just wasn't as satisfying as it could be. I can't put my finger on it. Neil Gaiman your books are good, but confusing to me. I like them but something about them always seems off. Unless you are being balanced with an experienced author. American Gods had two plots, and dragged a bit in the middle. I think the problem with Neverwhere is the main character Richard. I suppose he is the reluctant hero which, is a hard character to write well. Gaiman carries it off fairly well, but something is lacking. Oh well, I hate it when I can't pinpoint what I don't like. I will have to think on it. <br /><br />I am currently adding yet another comic to my online addiction. This is really getting a bit out of hand. Well really I just realize how out of hand it is with that list of them right there. I really need to catch up on 9th elsewhere. <a href=""http://www.smbc-comics.com/"">This is the newest thing.</a> I'll have to add it to the list.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a happy note I think my manic weekend is over. yee gods the last three days have not been fun. Men also go through a hormone cycle similar to women. The critic put it best ""We men have petals to you know.""

In which case the only Valentine I can really think of seeing tomorrow is Mike handing me my own beating heart back to me on the plate next to my ass. That doesn't mean it's Valentines day so much as Wednesday. The holiday is so contrived. Nothing like being spontaneously romantic on the same day every one else is doing it. It's a sad day in which wives are forcing there husbands to do something nice for them, and making it pathetically easy to do so. You should do things for you partner through out the year. If they only express romantic gestures for you on the given holidays it's sad and depressing. Well, it makes a ton of money so it's not like it is ever going away. I better get used to it.

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My stupid Interpersonal Communication class is gettting some kind of aggrivating, and even with its insightful knowledge base at my disposal I fell I will never truly learn to say that everytime you open your mouth I want to jab a pen in your eye. At least with the full texture of meaning I want. It's not like the class is hard in any facet of the imagination, but is so meaningless that everytime I leave I feel the urge to commit random attrocities on strangers to amuse myself. Not that this is really very likely as it takes far to much effort. The thought entertains me enough.&nbsp; The micro econ class is still entertaining. The amorality of economics is so sexy. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the real reason I'm going on about my classes aside from the need to vent. My folklore class, which is generally amazing, is going to make me do a project on folklore. Now, I know this comes as a suprise to everyone I'm sure. The fun and interesting part is it is a project in which I collect some modern folklore from a group and do some papers on it. So, I have to go out and activily collect some material. I'm still not exactly sure which group to do, but it will be some nerdy subgroup I'm sure. As I know only nerds really you will all (the three of you that read this) to give me some material, and preferably enlist your friends. Some ideas for groups include Anime conventions, something to do with fanfiction, somethign to do with webcomics, or table top gamers. I'll get back to everyone on details but I figured I would send out the warning first. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today wasn't very interesting a day. I made curry burritos from the left over chicken curry. They came out pretty well if I do say so myself. My nose is still all kinds of stuffed up, and I hate physics lab. Well enough of me commiting crimes against the english language by writing. The geneva convention only let's me get away with so much before it's a war crime."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes I know I should be asleep, but if you look at my actually journal page you'll see I got caught up redecorating. I wanted to switch to an S2 style so I could put up a link list. Which, I might add will be up shortly. That way I can distract everyone Else with the sheer amount of webcomics I read. I like the way this turned out. I went through a style where I was using a totally different color scheme. That was very mellow and rather soothing, but just didn't seem to work as Eric pointed out. This only need some minor tweaks and it will be as pretty awesome. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how my day went, I have a stuffy nose, and I managed to spill an entire cup of black coffee all on my black jeans, so it's a wash. Bad pun and I'm sorry. Though outside of the illness it was a pretty decent day. I'm going to go to sleep now I think, or at least get off LJ for a while."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ugh, I hate being sick. I simply hate it. I have now progressed into the snotty mucus stage of whatever illness I managed to contract. I went down to school to try and get some work done today. That didn't work out so well. I thought I was well enough right up until I got there and immediately regretted it. God willing tomorrow will be bearable for a full day of classes. I'd be more hopeful if I didn't know it was such a jerk. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonight I made some chicken curry in an attempt to feel better, and actually taste my food. Everyone else said it turned out well. I don't think I made it hot enough. I still have my tongue. So, I'm up from my 4 hour nap for an hour to goof off before I go back to sleep. I just realized I missed heroes... I'll have to use the internets to acquire it later. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was absolutely amazing out today. The first time it actually felt like colorado in a month or more. Tomorrow is supposed to be even warmer. This pleases me, but it would please me more if I was well enough to truly enjoy it. Oh well, maybe it takes away from how bitter I would be about having to stay inside to do things anyway. Damn adulthood I was promised no bedtimes, unlimited ice cream, and awesome movies. They didn't tell me I wouldn't sleep because I had to work, ice cream makes you fat, and those movies aren't as good as they look in previews."

Also, I think i'm getting sick. Scratch that I am getting sick , and am hell bound and determined to make it as fast and easy as possible. So I'm currently enjoying some miso soup. 

So, I'm at work, and decide to take a break from reading my economics (the sexy social science) book to read something else. Keeping in mind I don't really need to be reading it except for my own pleasure. One can only handle so much of it at a time. I go over to the community book/magazene share and pick up the GQ sitting in the basket. GQ is essentially targeted towards new york metrosexuals, and like most magazines that specialize in such smell horrendous. I picked this one up as it had a picture of Jake Gyllenhall on the cover (for the record I HATE, loathe, and dislike Brokeback mountain) and some story about gays in Iraq ( which was mildly interesting and terribly depressing. So, flipping through the GQ which usually promises some eyecandy I get to the section on politics. It's a story about Tom Coburn (US Senate R <http://coburn.senate.gov/public/> ), and was actually very entertaining. I'm a fiscal conservative and a social liberal. Which essentially means that I am wholly represented by 0 people in legislature. Though I don't think that anyone is truly represented. You just kind of vote and hope things even out in the end. I don't like the mans social policy (christian conservative), but anyone who can get up as a freshman senator and try to remove a essentially useless 200 million dollar bridge and make senators own up to 700 million dollar kickbacks (in essence) appropriated into bills. This done while running his medical practice for free on weekends gets a tip of the hat to be sure. Just figured I would mention that as it was interesting.

Ugh, I hate being sick, and tomorrow brings with it shoveling and potentially dinner out with my parents (whom I do love). As for a weekend spent enjoying friends and my health... I can only hope to get my room clean, and meet up with some people sometime.

I made it up my stupid god damn driveway. It took about 8  attempts, but we made it. This brings me to the point of driving in this stupid godforsaken weather. It's borderline insanity! that line is then crossed when you decide to go out in it. It took me an hour to get to boulder and over an hour to get back.

Well Ideally this will be posted on regularly. So, I don't feel the need to pour out everything right away. I hate Interpersonal Communications class.

"event","Of course I never update this thing, and I think that I have figured out why. Firstly, at home I usually have something better to distract me from doing homework ie: anything but this thats not work. Secondly, I try not to do homework ever, and I'm not exactly sure when it gets done, but it surely isn't right now. Actually my homework gets done during my work ethic power hour! Which happens to be anywhere from 10pm to 1am. God, I have to get out of that habit. So now I'm sitting at school waiting for a study group to get togethor. Naturally i'm doing something totally non-productive instead. I would be reading comics, but I'm all tapped out at the moment, and I don't feel like downloading any of my current obsession or finding any new ones. 

yesterday was funny... and probably not entirely the good kind of funny. Well the good kind of funny for me it's made the good kind of funny for anyone who is not me simply by them being not me. This is good news for you the reader as you are not me...unless of course I'm reading this which than makes it me, but I suppose thats a moot point. Anyway yesterday was funny, and instead of telling you why so you can laugh I'm actually going to study. Because not telling You is funny to me, and thats all I care about after yesterday. heh. Also, my study group is here so now I have to work.

Later Addition:

Yeah so I am home now. The funny thing that happened to me is that I was closer to just having a nervous breakdown. And all that would then entail. Boy howdy was that fun. Nothing like being sick and under an abnormal or unhealthy amount of stress to break a person into a number of smaller than person sized bits. Then I got dragged to a presentation on self hypnosis. That was made funny because it was with aubrey and I could totally turn my brain off. Thats right I turn it on...sometimes.

Now to study for another Exam! That I have at 8am tomorrow, Yuck. At least I think this Biochem exam went well. Even if the proffesor showed up in spandex AGAIN! Thank god the pants he was wearing are more amorphus than the last exams outfit ::Shudder::."

hours monday with a humming bird trapped in the store. With the help of
a customer and some brooms we managed to get the tired little visitor
outside. I never got the customers name. Today was apparently a shift
from birds to dogs. First someone lost their great peikanese well i saw
him outside and called him in. He stayed in the store behind the
counter with me till she came and picked him up. His name was buddy.
Then later that night two red retrivers just wondered into the store
and came to say hello. I kept them behind the counter and called the
owner he didn't know they were gone so he came down and picked them up.
Their names were Copenhagen and Skoal. So that was fun and exciting.

All it is is propaganda, and I have never been one to take propaganda even if I agree with it.

Work the past two days has been relatively uneventful. I was electrocuted again and had some more awesome conversations with some of the regulars. I was also complimented on constantly being cheerful and very polite. So those are all on the up and up, but I have to start looking for another job. I like it there but I need a second job. Yes, second as in two at the same time oh boy. They don't give me enough hours not that I would want them. this isn't to say that right now I wouldn't take them.  I want another job thats more in my field this is a very cool money job. 

I also feel that I haven't been accomplishing enough things lately. This could be a by product of school being gone , and the initial ""hooray no more Fucking school"" feeling with it. Also the lack of kendo makes me depressed. Well on with life and I'll just have to do more I suppose."

She turned out to be expenetionally cooler than I was expecting. No offense but most viki's (speling?) I've met are not the best people to uhh be around. Thats a nice way to put it. So today was funny especially when my mom noticed and said "" what the hell did you do!?"" , but they are ok with it. 

I had to work tonight. Tavia stopped in she is doing a lot better than when I last saw her apperntly she got hypothermia to the point where her kidneys and liver had stopped working. She is lucky to be alive, but is doing a lot better. I know because she talked my ear off for like 20 min as she always does. I don't mind she is such a cool lady. 

The other visiters I got at work, besides the regular people that I like to see that complemented my piercing, were less enjoyable. Namely these two idiots that I have never seen come in and well made me realize why I don't like people sometimes. So, these two guys wait around for like 2 hours for these random girls to show up so they can wonder into the mountains and get drunk. At this point i'm just smiling, nodding, and hoping to god those bimbo's get her so they can all become purina bear chow. Nothing is more pathetic than two idiots waiting around banking on the off chance of sex. Then if thats possible they get more pathetic. So they come in to talk to me five minutes before I close the doors and I learn that the tall one is in a relationship with a bitch for the last 10 months and now their on a ""break"" (I will admit I thought of friends), and she is off getting drunk and possibly screwing with some guys. So he is depressed and to try to lighten the mood they make references to going into the woods getting drunk and having gay sex. This is something I may never understand. Why straight men think alluding to them having drunken gay sex in the woods lightens any mood. Then feverently denying it with admonations of not being into that or ""I'll stab you if you try"" kind of speach. I just don't understand. That and the depressed ones whole theory on women being seasonal. Summer: Crazy, Fall: Depressed, Winter: Hibernating ( he just looked confused so was I), and Spring: Nice. Oh, and they also referred to the anticipating girls as bitches, whores and sluts. This is more understandable than the gay sex, but still. well I eventually looked at my watch and kind of forced them out, but not until after the conversation where the depressed one said there was payote all over blue mountain and how he wished he could have some so he could imagine women, but he would only end up molesting his friend while high. Yes that was delightful.

The funny part is I only sold 210$ in lotto which isn't too much comparatively. But really the most intersting thing about work today apart from the lotto machine jamming and the credit card machine stopping normal function during a rush. bastards, is the people that came in today it was just kinda fun. A lot of people I know it's weird to think I have been working at the gas station for a year now! Well I met a lady tonight that accosted me in the hallway after genetics class. It turns out she is a Phd student for psychology and we have the same cell bio class together next fall, Crazy. She was really nice and I think it wouldn't be to bad to get to know her. I wish I remembered to get her name... 

Two other people who I know from campus came in as well. The most emotionally trying thing was when one of the regulars came in that I had gotten to know a little better she has a major reputation as a talker. She went through a broken spine and seemed to be getting a lot better an awesome lady. She came in today and she had apparently gotten seizures and wasn't doing so well it was just so sad I have faith in her though she is so strong it scares me.

On another front of the days events nothing spectacular I should be studying for my Chem final soon like tommorow. That should be a lot of fun. I'm not too worried about the genetics exam.

The power went off at my house so I didn't wake up in time for cartoons. What a wonderful way to start my saturday it just made it ever so complete. Couple this with the fact that after I got up and managed to catch yugioh I felt so tired that I ended up just going back to sleep till I had to go to work at 4. That was a big mistake.

That device where you put the card in with the carbon copy paper and slide the top portion across. The we had to print out a receipt and staple it to the thing. I did 300+ dollars in credit card transactions, but the day person I feel sorry for had to do 700+ dollars worth and it takes forever to do this so there is a HUGE line. Then on top of that the hot dog roller machine broke while I was cleaning it. Not only did it break but it electrocuted me... TWICE! It was like being shocked by an electric fence so it wasn't terrible but still. Add this to a night filled with some of the most obnoxious customers ever. God anything from the complainers to that damn women you had me almost pre-pay her for the wrong pump and she just slapped the money down and then she went over and didn't come back in because she wasn't paying attention. Also, the veritable horde of people that came in after we closed to get gas   god. usually it's just one or two but tonight it was 7. So it has been a long night at work. One of the worst I have had in a while. 

Now after that atrocious day at work I get to do home work and study for midterms. OH boy. Well at least it's over. and Liana is hyper so how could i be anything but fine. Thanks Liana you sure do cheer people up without realizing it. You're Awesome"

Which is the idea i fansied in the beggining. I should be more realistic on the matter i don't even check my freaking e-mail everyday.

So i have a intro to chinese test tommorow that I should be studing for, and a large quantity of other shit to work on. thats a blast to even think about.

I was computer shopping today. that made me feel real happy let me tell you. I was looking at dells, somehow this seemed inately evil, but I'm not really sure. I need a computer and shopping for them is not my favorite thing in the world. Still not as bad as god damned summer school. yeah thats hell oh god so freaking expensive! i mean honestly 1000+ dollars to take calculus 2 for gods sake not including books! and anything else. Bastards they can rot in hell. 

well thats all for me now off to study, I must succeed!"

"event","Well first off, my apologies for not updating recently at all. Not that it really matters no one reads this. Well few people read this. 

life is as follows, midterms are this week and boy isn't that just dandy chemistry is going to take me and leave me for dead on the side of the road in arkansas to be raped by whatever happens along, but other than that no worries. 

A funny thing happened on campus today. It was a affirmitave action bakesale! cookie prices were as follows: White male,1$ colored males and white females .50$ and colored females recieved a free cookie. It was something like that I'm not sure of the actual prices I couldn't see through the GIANT hord of protestors in my way. God, people are so stupid. I thought that the bake sale was a interesting way to get a point across. Regaurdless of the fact that the people running it were retards, and I guess the bake sale has been done else where before. Just like CU to steal a original idea so they can have a protest. I guess there were also speakers there for affirmitive action. Needless to say I thought it was easier to look at than the damnable prolife demonstration and there wall of dead fetuses. 

Oh, I watched a lot of Naruto! That was a blast, I absolutely love it to death. Thank you very much, Liana you ruiner of lives. I need more of that particular drug by the way.

In other news my conditioner is dying my hair purple. Yes the fruit fusion hydrating blackberry has died my hair purple and my scalp for that matter. I love it! not only does the conditioner smell wonderful and leave my hair in great condition it gives the added bonus of dying it purple as long as I continually use it. It only makes it so my hair looks purple i have pretty dark hair so it has a purple tinge when the light shines on it. I don't know it's kinda a fun thing.

I suppose thats all back to toiling."

School was once again an enjoyable prospect. So I tried to go to my Russian fairy tails recitation and I looked up the room. Well I go there and it's not in there. Apparently it is in a different room but she(the graduate student teaching) wanted a room change and now I have no idea where it could be. I spent the whole hour walking around campus trying to figure out what the hell was going on! Finally found the other TA and They told me that I probably didn't miss much but I'll have to go talk to my TA on like tuesday or something. What a pain.

Then after that lovely incident I made the whole trek across campus so I could drive home and go to work. Talk about an experience there it was incredibly boring. Not that is anything unusual. 

Then after work I came home and watched Monk. Anyone who hasn't seen that show should watch it. Seriously, it is phenomenal and Tony Scheluba (misspelled i think sorry) is a pimp. Tonight was the season premier and it was excellent
Well thats it for me.

God, my poor legs ache.
Far too much walking for today.
In need of some sleep."

"event","Well let's see if I can actually get in the habit of updating this thing. I mean honestly. Today I had NO SCHOOL!!! woo. My day was very uneventful. Considering I slept in till 2. I didn't mean to but it felt really nice to just sleep so thats what I did. Crazy dreams of course ensued. Thursday may very well become my new favorite day this semester. 

Even though I spent about 5 hours on homework, and I'm still not completely done. I did manage to finish my lit homework. We're reading the Island of Dr. Monruae and analyzing I mean ""close Reading"" the relationship between animal and human boundaries and then I have to pump out a 4-5 page essay. I'm sincerely debating just doing the damn thing so I don't have to deal with it later. But I have to spend 4 weeks with this book so I'm sure I can wait a little bit. 

Well thats about the post. 
Maybe i should end with a Haiku?
No, laziness will win."

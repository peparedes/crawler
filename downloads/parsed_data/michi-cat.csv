"event","Mom,

The kids are not letting me watch the new box. The only time I get to watch is when they are hogging the bed at night. Thank you for leaving the light on. :)

And is there something you can do about Kimba jumping me all the time. He just won't listen to me when I hiss at him.

"event","Dear Mom,

I made nice with the kits this morning, don't expect it again for a long time. There I am trying to watch birds and sniff smells, and the two of them want to ask a million questions about everything.

Sorry I was such a grouch yesterday when you were feeling so bad. I just didn't want to get in the middle of all that kitten cuddling that was going on all day. Bah!"

I don't see what all the fuss is about. If Akiko is stupid enough to fall into the toilet, she should have to do her own drying off. Why are you waisting clean towels on her. Silly git.

Love,
Unimpressed One."

"event","Dear Little Menaces,

Mommy hates it when you get into her cooking pots. Just cause they are on an open shelf does not mean you can play in there. If you piss her off enough she will yell at you...and trust me you don't want that to happen.

And if you don't mind...when I am snuggling with Mommy under the covers I am not a kitten toy. Do not try to batt at me then. I'm the senior cat here and I have special rights and privilges that you two have to earn.

I must say I am impressed with the ease with which you both have learned to climb the cat tree. Just don't think you can use it as a place to jump down on me from.

The 1st Cat.

PS. The hockey game in the kitchen was fun to watch."

"event","Mommy,

I don't get just exactly why you though you needed two more cats...and kittens at that. But I guess they are ok. Kimba is sweet and he knows how to be respectfull of his elders. But that Akiko, she needs work. Please tell her to back off. I don't like her right up in my face.

Thanks for doing the litter box today, even if you felt you had to bring out the big red monster. I appriciate the extra cleanings, with 3 of us using it now it needs it more often.

I really like the new food. Can we have more of that please.

Love,
Your number one cat
Michi"

"event","Dear Ms. Opposable Thumbs (I believe the humans call you <lj user=scarlettj9>?),

I tried to join note_from_cat so I could write you this letter, but they didn't want me. *sniff*

OK, I'm over it. The real reason I'm writing this is to address the Kitten Problem (TM). I don't know if you've noticed, but they're EVERYWHERE. This morning, I tried lying in the windowsill, but <i>someone was already there</i>. Creepy. When you fed me (the food is substandard, but that's a separate issue), they swarmed the bowl and took over. This situation is unacceptable. Remove the interlopers or I will have to take matters into my own paws.

Thank you for attention to this matter,
Michi"

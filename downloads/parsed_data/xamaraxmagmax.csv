"event","I went back to Nova Roma after I was feeling better. I didnt really tell anyone but the professor, sorry about that guys. 

What can I say? I was in Brazil eight days, nothing much happened. I didnt get to spend a lot of time with Lucius..as usual..because he was busy with work etc. I mostly just hung around the city. It's mosre quiet there then any place I have been too. Sometimes the silence is comfortable. I surely enjoyed it. 

Looks like we have more people at school! Im always up for making new friends. 

<lj-cut text=""ooc."">
Hey, sorry I havent been around on AIM or interacting that much in the journals. It hasnt been easy since school started and all that. I dont plan  on quitting or anything, just thought I'd say sorry for the absence! <3"

"event","Well, I'm feeling much better today than before. Just remind me to never go on a train again, ok?

The city was ok. The trains pretty much made me sick, but I tried my best to just get over it. Alex and Theresa seemed to be enjoying themselves. 

I got to see Pietro's hair. Its not as bad as he makes it seem, really. It's very shiny! 

ps. Pietro is mean."

"event","<i> Amara lays in her bed with her covers up to her neck. Shes reading one of her favorite books ""Dangerous Angels"". That book always makes her cry. She couldnt relate to any of the characters really, it was just so true.
She stops and puts the book down. Her major headaches and weakness keeps coming back. It was how she felt when she first came to the mansion. It was the planes that did it her. Being away from the ground made her sick, something to do with her mutation. But, she wasnt in an air plane? or a boat? She had no clue what would make her feel this way again. 
She thought about going to the medlab, or to see Xavier, but she didnt want to bother them.

""It will go away soon enough"" she thought.

Amara closes her blinds and lays back in her bed. 

""I hate being sick"" she sighs, and falls asleep."

"event","Wow, tonight was great. I had a lot of fun just hanging out and listening to Ali, Lance and Alex. They are so good! Yeah, I left a little after Kitty, I dont know what made me so tired.
Tomorrow Alex wanted to go into the city, so me and Ther are probably going to go. I mean, I want to, I dont know how well I will be feeling in the morning.

[private]

I got the chance to be around Alex a little more. It was great, he is so much fun just to be around. I'm not sure if he likes me as much as I like him. I sound so elementry, but its true! I dont want to make myself seem like an idiot. I guess I should hang out with him some time, ya know? Like just me and him.

Im quite tired, so sorry if this post didnt make sense!

"event","I met Alex. He is very nice. (y muy guapo *wink*) I wanted to talk to him tonight, but I cant find him. *shrug* I need to stop being so antisocial. I dont mean to be, I just dont know when everyone is out at the pool congregating or hanging out in the den, so I just catch up on my homework.. or watch movies. I dont like watching movies by myself all the time though! 
I bought some gummi worms and pixxi stix today. Maybe thats why I am so upbeat! 

Girl talk with Theresa is great! I am such a dork, I need to get a life besides talking about boys and not actually talking to them that much. I cant help I am all spaz-tic and shy.

Well maybe not so shy. I dont know. 

Right now I am watching The Recruit with Colin Farrel. He is very good looking. Irish accents are so cute! American ones are cute, too though. 

Wow, I have a tooth ache now from all those sweets.

"event","Oh my gosh sorry I havent been around for the past days guys! I have been pretty sick. I dont know whats wrong with me. I guess its all in my mind, maybe I do miss Brazil. I should take a visit there, but I get too sick on the plane ride. I dont know what to do.

..it sucks to be sick on your birthday.

I have seen some new people around. I should introduce myself. Where is Theresa? She is the only one I can talk about boys with! 

If you see me around, say hi! I need to be cheered up.

To anyone that has just come here, my name is Amara. I enjoy fire, music, and I am single. 
No really. Hi. 

*ahem* Now who has missed me?

I did get to have a nice talk to Jamie the other day. Or Jamie!Clone rather. *shrugs* I still dont understand it all. He is very sweet, but a little shy. Its cute though. I think I scared him with me just flaming up all the sudden. I hate it when I do that! I really need to work on it.

Hm, I feel like having a party. Oh wait! My birthday is next Friday! *wink!*

"event","I did some more practicing outside today. Theres not much to do around here. I get bored too easily.
I've pretty much mastered melting and shaping. I just need to work on my burning form. I did a little today. But I dont know how hot or bright I get...I dont think anyome would want to be around me. *shrugs* I have talked to a few people. I have talked to Theresa the most. Everyone else just kinda ignores me. Oh well. Im not gonna whine about it, I guess it just gives me more time to practice my mutation. 

Later tonight I might watch some movies. Hm, something like...Sleepy Hollow or...Lord of the Rings.

Hope everyone had a good day."

Hm, any suggestions to what I should reshape these statues into? Perhaps someone would like to model for me. Oh! I can do it full sized! Wow, Im getting so excited. 

Ok, who wants to be my model? I know you wannaaa..."

<lj user=""phasing_angel""> asked if I wanted to go ice skating. I've never been before, but hey, if it means I get to meet some more of you all, then thats great. So I think I will go.
There were some other people. Ah, I cant remember their names. Why am I so bad with names? 
I think I will spend some time in my room today. Play some music. 
Then I might venture out in this place. Anyone wanna give me a tour?

"event","life has been super fabulous. been working my booty off. i need a car. so hopefully i can save up enough money this summer to get a super cute one. my daddy started dialysis last week which was heartbreaking. he felt like he was giving in to the pain, but my mom and i tried to tell him that he would eventually start to feel more like a human being after a few treatments. my daddy lost 14 lbs in 3 days after 2 treatments of dialysis because his kidneys werent doing their job by cleansing my daddys body so he had lots of fluid in his belly. but he's feeling better now. he gets really tired after his treatments because they're four hours long and he goes three times a week, but that will soon change because my sister was passed for surgery at umd medical center!! surgery is scheduled for this upcoming wednesday so pray that our family can finally put this nightmare behind us and that everyone is safe and healthy! mollys birthday was on saturday and we had such a blast! went out to dinner, got drunk, and went cosmic bowling. super fun time with all the kids!! the 4th was super fun too. went to a bbq at jey's and saw fireworks. i love all of his friends. they are so wonderful. and his sister laura is super nice too. monday i went rafting at rock state park with jey and his friends all day which was so fun....this weekend was great! my boys came to visit me at beach bums tonight. i love them!!!! and amy and kristin came too!! so i felt super loved. so things are fabulous right now!!!!"

"event","so much is happening. i wish that i could just take away all this shit that so many of my friends are going through. its not fair that such wonderful people have to deal with such heartache. my friends are so strong and i love each and every one of them and i know that they will persevere and make it through all of this. i just want all of my friends to be happy and have wonderful lives. i wish that i could do more for them because they are fabulous people.  

we finally had a breakthrough with my dad. our family friend who was going through testing to be a kidney donor passed. so now it's official. my dad has a match. yesterday had to be one of the best days of my life...i found out that someone was going to save my dads life. our families have been friends for years and the compassion and generosity that our friends have is unbelievable. this man has a wife and three kids, but yet he is still willing to donate his kidney to save my dads life and give my family hope. how do you ever repay someone for that? i'm really at a loss for words that there are people out there that are so amazingly selfless. nothing possibly compares to the high that my family is on right now. we have been through so much together over the past four years that all this shit was second nature to us, but finally we are getting our miracle. my dad deserves this so much. for the past four years we have seen him at his lowest of lows and fall into a deep depression about his health and finally yesterday he smiled and had pep in his step. nothing can compare to that. absolutely nothing. so hooray for fabulous news!! 

so i realized that i have changed a lot. i am not the same person who left for college last august. and i like it. i like it a lot. i'm so over everything about high school...the people, the drama, the petty girls, the immaturity. i like where i'm at right now. i'm finding out who i want to be and how i want to live my life. i'm surrounding myself with people i want to be around and who bring out the best in me...especially my mcdaniel and lindt families whom i love so much!! i'm finding out what is important in life and moving on. looks like this is me growing up...

i talked to my boys yesterday. gosh i love dave and steve. they're such fun people and great friends. i cant wait for dave to come home so all of us can go to kaos =) also, i went bathing suit shopping and bought a cute suit =) the bottom is solid black and the top is zebra print with pink strings. i love it. cant wait for the cicadas to leave so i can lay out and tan. 

work was fun tonight because i was with melissa and katie. and not to mention one of my bestest friends of life came by...beth! love her so much. what a nice surprise =)"

oh boys. i want one of my own. i hope that there is potential with jeromy because i like him a lot but i know that he has a lot going on in his life right now so i completely understand if he doesnt have the time or energy for a relationship. i'm definitely game though. so we'll see =) 

this week has been great so far! i worked at lindt on monday morning with melissa and then relaxed at home with my sis. yesterday i slept in and went to amy's sisters softball game with her fam then spent the night at amy's. such a blast. her parents are wonderful and her younger sis is a riot. i'm so happy that amy and i live so close because we have become the bestest of buds. this morning we went to the mall with her mom, her sis sally, and sal's friend alexa. so much fun. now i'm home and looking forward to going out with my bf's tonight!! i cant wait to see my girls and hopefully the boys will come too =) so not much else is going on...just enjoying summer. looks like my second job is going to be at beach bums which should be very fun!! ooh american idol is on tonight. diana better make it into the final two. i voted for her last night, so i'm keeping my fingers crossed!! so tomorrow i'll probably go tanning and bathing suit shopping. i am so productive =) ha. gotta love summer.

"event","it is officially summer!! and i love it. i finished my last exam on thursday morning and headed home around 11. p.s. my roomie is the sweetest ever. on thursday morning she gave me pink tulips (my absolute fav!!) and wrote me a four page letter that made me cry. i'm going to miss her like whoa. for my first night of college freedom i cuddled up with a blanket in my pjs and watched survivor =) it definitely feels fabulous to have no work to do for a change! on friday i had ""ashley's day of pampering"" so i went tanning and got my nails done. i didnt realize how much i missed getting my nails done and chatting with the employees. i went to my usual place (lisa's nails on joppa rd...go there they are wonderful!!) and all of the employees were so happy to see me because i havent been able to get my nails done since i went to school!! they all wanted to know about college and my life. i love that place. on friday night my sis and i rented ""love actually"" which is now my movie of the week. if you are a hopeless romantic then this is the flick for you. super fabulous. loved it. yesterday i went shopping, chatted with amy, and relaxed at home. the highlight of my afternoon was when molly called me!! i havent chatted with my bf for a while because we both have been so busy from school and such. she comes home on wednesday which is so exciting!! i cant wait to see her. (p.s. shorty- i am praying that everything goes well this week and especially for you, katy and your mom to have the strength to get through this. i love you and your fam so much!!) i went out with jeromy last night which is always fun and a good time. we went to the mariner and met up with some of his friends who are just as fabulous as he is. a very fun evening. this morning i got up for church then went out to brunch with the fam. we visited my grandmother for a few hours this afternoon and then my sis and i headed over to bed, bath & beyond to buy fun accessories to give our bathroom a makeover. it looks wonderful!! oh! tomorrow is my first day back at lindt!! woohoo!! i cant wait. now i must go back to the orioles game...

hope everyone has a great night!! love you all =)"

towson in three days and i cant wait! i was in towson today because i had a doctors appointment at gbmc. driving around with the windows down, sun shining, warm breeze, radio blaring...summer time is so close =) today was absolutely gorgeous. one of those days where you want to gather up all your closest buds, have a bbq, and play outside like you're six again. i love these days. i had my econ final today which was hard to say the least. i had no idea what the last problem essay was getting at so i made my best attempt to dance around what i thought the correct answer might possibly be. but i am so relieved that it's over!! hooray! i have two more exams left and they should be easy...so smooth sailing from here on out!! tomorrow is amy's birthday which is very exciting and should be lots of fun!! i have been waiting for a week to give amy her gift so finally the day is here! not much else has been going on except for kids packing up their room and studying. so tomorrow i plan on tanning out in the quad...and doing absolutely nothing. the fabulous life of a college student at its best...

i miss my best friends so much. i havent seen beth since christmas because she goes to college in utah and i cant wait to see her! i havent seen molly or kelly since spring break so some quality f4 time is definitely needed!! i love you girls so much!! cant wait for summer when the four of us are back together again =) get ready for some clubbin, ritas runs, pool days, bbqs, shopping marathons, and sleepovers!!

only three finals left and then i am done!! woohoo!! yesterday was my last day of classes which was fabulous =) after my classes i had lunch with my girls and robby then headed to the silent auction that intervarsity was sponsoring. my roomie was chairing the event so i went to support my girl! the silent auction was a huge success, so snaps to kristen!! after the auction i met up with some friends for a quick dinner then came back to my room for a little bit to relax before our floor meeting. after the meeting all the girls and kevin packed into suzannes room to watch a movie =) then kris and i hit the sack early. today we woke up early to clean and pack. then i attempted to study for my econ final =) i talked to steve the hottie today!! he made me realize how much i miss all my boys from back home especially steve, collin, and dave. i can't wait until the group is all together again for summer =) we have too much fun!! five days and counting...   

p.s. my mom and dad sent me a final exam care package in the mail! how cute!! it has all my favorite snacks =) thanks folks!!

"event","my daily love horoscope: someone has high hopes for you. will you disappoint this person, or will you give him or her your heart? if you don't know your own feelings yet, that's okay, too. just be clear about where you stand. 

**i'm such a hopeless romantic. i'm ready to give my heart to somebody. i hope this comes true sooner than later =)

i have been taking apart my room over the past few days- remembering all of the memories of the past year. i am going to be so sad to leave everyone up here and not see them everyday...especially my favorite=) amy and i are pretty much attached at the hip. it's going to be so strange not watching american idol together every week, listening to our chill mixes, going to the gym, taking naps together, talking about everything and anything that's on our minds...we have only known each other for a year, but i feel like i have known her my whole life. there's one thing about going to college...you're thrown into this whirlwind of new faces and new surroundings in a matter of moments and i was so lucky to meet someone so super fab to venture into this new experience with!! so thanks amy for everything! i definitely believe that we were destined to meet because we're two peas in a pod =)

yesterday was an overall good day. i woke up early to go to breakfast with amy before going to philosophy lecture. i had a chocolate chip muffin which was yummy. philosophy lecture was boring as usual but that was my last one!! woohoo!! i came back to my room and studied for my finals a bit then headed off to lunch with my ladies and robby =) then  i went to stu's music shoppe with jen and amy for a quick trip off campus, watched freaky friday with the girls and fell asleep. then i continued my nap while listening to my love song playlist which was much needed!! i woke up in time for dinner then headed to the gym with devie and jen for our daily burn! i watched american idol then hit the sack early. it was a good day =)

jeromy called a couple nights ago which was nice because i havent talked to him in a while. what a cool kid =)

hope everyone has a wonderful afternoon and evening! love you all =)"

"event","hey kids! long time, no update! things have definitely taken off in the past year or so! in eleven days i will officially be a sophomore in college! they say that time flies when you're having fun, but who knew that it would move this quickly! this past year has been fabulous! i have met so many new, wonderful and exciting people and learned so many lessons from each and every one of them. i am so blessed to have my mcdaniel family in my life! my girls up here are too good to be true! i have become super close with four girls up here who i am going to be living with next year which is going to be a blast! without these kids  i wouldnt know what to do with myself up here! of course i need to give a personal shout out to my bf...AMY! i have never met someone that is so much like me! we have too much fun together and i love her to pieces! how ironic that we had to move away to college to meet one another when we only live five minutes away from each other in towson! and how can i possibly forget robby! i think i have found my soulmate! this kid is me trapped in a mans body. who else can talk about accessories with me as we watch survivor and wear our buffs? too perfect! also, my roomie is the best. i cannot tell you how close we have become over the past year. i couldn't have asked for a sweeter person to live with! its going to be so sad leaving our room because so much has happened in that small space and i wouldnt change any of it! so, all in all, college has been everything i could have ever hoped for! as for family stuff, things could be better, but overall we're all hanging in there. as most of you know my dad needs to have a kidney transplant so keep your fingers crossed that his surgery will be successful and that he has a speedy recovery! everyone else is doing wonderfully and is in good health! so, life is good. summer is very soon and i cant wait to go back to work at lindt! i miss and love everyone so much! im very excited to be able to gossip and chat with everyone again...and have boy talk with melissa! as for boys, i love them. even though they may be dumb at times i cant help but love them. some of the boys at mcdaniel are fabulous while others are left to be desired. but, thats okay because i have plenty of friend crushes (in mcdaniel lingo means someone who you want to be friends with) which keep me occupied. although, there is one boy that i have an interest in at home. so, we'll see how that progresses =)

now it is time that i go study for my econ quiz tomorrow...but stay tuned for another entry very soon! love you all =)"

"event","You, 
I'm not sure this is what you call a friendship. I'm not sure you would call this anything. I don't know if I expected it to be better than this - or if I should of just figured that we would talk every now and then and nothing else. I should have seen this coming. I should have been fully prepared to be used again...or whatever you would call this. Shame on me for thinking things could change. Shame on me for always being right there for you. Shame on me for trying again. Shame on me for wasting my time in trying to be friends with you. What a fool I am. 

Throughout our friendship - it was always somebody else. I could never get you to see that I was right there beside you. As much as I tried - you never wanted to see that. You looked passed me...you walked passed me. You accomplished that....not even caring to see how bad it hurt me. That's just it - you don't care about me. You never did...and I knew that. It was always about you....never about anyone else. You wanted what you wanted and would do just about anything to anyone to get that. If it meant ripping your best friend's heart out - you would do just that and never think twice. 

4-5 months went by from the time we lost touch or whatever you want to call it. But the day you decided that you wanted to try again. Where was I? Right there. I don't know many people who would of been open to being friends with you again, after all the shit you put me through. Do you have any idea how many tears I cried? That wasn't supposed to happen. I never should of let you get to me like that. Shame on me again. 

And you know I would have done just about anything for you. I would have taken a bullet for you - and there are not many people I could easily say I would do that for. Maybe that is why you walked all over me - and maybe that is why you seem to think you can do that still to this day. Things have changed - I've changed - and I'll be damned if you are going to do that again. 

We talked about this the other day. I mentioned that I was tired of trying to make this friendship work when all you did was nothing. You never did anything though, so why now? You apologized and said things would change. You said you loved me. Bull shit. I told you that the friendship I had was right in front of you, and all you needed to do was take it. I'm not going to be around forever. I'm not going to wait. I don't know what kind of effect that has on you. 

I can't seem to be what you want. I can't compete. And therefore, I quit. I hope one day you finally realize what you had. I hope you realize how great it was to have a friend like me. And how you will probably never have someone like that again. Maybe it won't be too late when you realize this, maybe I won't be too far away. But if I am...just know you had your chance many times. And you blew it. 

I can't drop people that meant so much to me for so long- you know that, but I can't keep you in my life if you are going to do this to me again. I can't go through the hell I went through - I'm not walking down that path again. 

I've always been right there - and I know deep down that if you ever needed anything that I would be there again. I do care about you and love you. But I can't put myself through this. I'm not going to let you do this to me again. 

""I'm going to turn around and walk away. You can watch me go, or you can make me stay."" 

Tired, Me"

You're a hopeless romantic.  You fall in love easily and quickly, and often have your heart broken.  You like romantic movies, books, and you're always trying to think of some way to wow your honey.  People call you sentimental or idealistic, and sometimes they even make some comment about they might vomit if they have to listen to go on and on any more.  Phew.  Some day, though, you will make someone very happy.<br>

"event","this weekend was the best weekend of my life. i went to maggies birthday party on friday and we made fun necklaces and i loved it. we had a five foot sub and i think its great how the sub is taller than molly =) and the sub fell off the counter and elbie saved it. i made maggie a bear from bab and i named it chester. it has the cutest outfit and it sings happy birthday!! so i went up to western maryland to visit my sister this weekend and i looooved it. i went to the junior day thing and that was interesting. i ate chinese for dinner with my sister and her crew and then we went to the gospel choir concert. omg there was a crazy lady running down the aisles dancing and she would occasionally break out in wild laughter. it was the funniest crap i have ever seen. kelly and alicia would definitely have appreciated it. so then we went to friendlys for ice cream. it was great fun. i love lisa. she is probably the greatest person i met up at western maryland. lol you have been slothed! fun times. yesterday was mothers day. my parents and i went to my grandparents house for dinner. it was good. my grandparents are moving so while i was there my grandmother let me take some things. i took this barbie game that was my moms in the 1950's. it's an original barbie game and it's definitely one of my favorite memories in that house. and secondly, i took a picture of jesus that my grandparents had hanging in there hallway on the second floor. it's one of those optical illusion things where if you stare into jesus' eyes long enough they will open. i remember staring at that picture for like 20 minutes when i was little to make his eyes open, and finally i can do it. it's really special to me. anyways, everyone hooked up this weekend and it makes me so happy. alicia met a hot boy and kissed five times. you should get her to tell you the story because you need her to demonstrate how he stares at her before he goes in for the kiss. wondrous. and he works at linens and things so we are going to drive over there to fake buying towels just so i can see him and give alicia my opinion. i'm excited. yeah so i have a C in physics. a lousy C. how is this possible you may ask? well one freakin test thats worth 40% of your grade really stinks. i saw the yearbook today for the first time and i am so proud of it. my opening pages that i did with maribel turned out so nice and i'm really excited. i think everyone will love the book. so overall things have been great. i need to talk to kath. i hope everythings ok with her. i got a message on my machine from her and she sounded upset. i could just tell by her voice we know each other so well. i called her back yesterday and left a message, but she NEVER gets them. i just got an email from her. aw i hope everythings ok. i called her back and she's at her flute lesson. she better call me. and mags is having problems with eric and he's a real ass. i really hope that works out too. on a happier note to end this entry, WAY TO GO ROTHSTER!"

I knew that this moment would come in time
That I'd have to let go and watch you fly
I know you're coming back so why am I dying inside

Are you searching for words that you can't find
Trying to hide your emotions but eyes don't lie
Guess there's no easy way to say goodbye

I'll be standing at the edge of the earth
Hoping that someday you'll come back again
I'll be standing at the edge of the earth hoping for someday, someday

Don't misunderstand what I'm trying to say
I don't want to let you leave this way
I want you to know that I stand right by your side

And I know this may be
The very last time that we see each other cry
But whatever happens know that I

I'll be standing at the edge of the earth
Hoping that one day you'll come back again
I'll be standing at the edge of the earth hoping that someday
You'll come back to me"

"event","i haven't written in forever because i have been studying so much for AP's. i think i am really prepared for ap calc. i'm actually pretty excited about it and scared at the same time. so life has been crazy as usual. i had my birthday party last saturday and it was wondrous. i had the greatest time with the late nite crew. dana did her impression of elbie and her irish dancing and my mom was cracking up so hard she was crying. and my dad was loving alicia as always. chrissy got me this wondrous bracelet and i love it so much. and laur bought me the cutest purse and its light blue which is my favorite color and a picture frame with us from prom that i put right next to my bed =) beth made me a belt and i got so many compliments on it and its the cutest. those three girls gave me the best gifts. i love personal stuff =) i got sooooo many cds and i love them all. i listen to them while i study. so on sunday i went to work as usual. monday and tuesday were normal days. wake up, school, homework, study, sleep. yaya. after school on wednesday i went to dana's house for 2 seconds and then mike, alicia, germ, and i went to towson. that was wondrous. we were crossing the street and a small freakish lady asked us if some random girl on the street was a vampire. it was kinda scary, but alicia talked to her anyways. weird lady. so we went to trader joes and bought fruit then went to borders and met this guy at the espresso bar named brendon and he has the sweetest voice ever. very nice guy. then i went home. thursday night we had our concert. it went well. kelly...""i can't believe it's been 4 years."" sweet jesus. lol your brother cracks me up =) yesterday was a great day. i got 16 points on my AP questons, a 98% on my spanish quiz (yess kelly pollo), and i went to my guidance counselor because they have the most recent class rank and i'm third in the class. i'm so happy. my parents are proud of me. recently, i have become a lot closer to my parents and i really like it. we don't fight hardly ever anymore and i can actually talk to them about my problems and get decent advice. i looked up all this college stuff yesterday afternoon and i got really excited. i can't wait to go to college. i really want to go to muhlenberg soooo bad. i visited there and its absolutely gorgeous. and it's 25 minutes away from new york city and omg i love it. the only problem is that it's $31,000. yaya. my parents said they will pay half, so i need to get at least $15,000 in scholarship and that will be hard being out of state, but i'm determined. i've been really motivated since january and its a great feeling. so today i have to study study study and i'm going to the mall. it should be fun =) happy birthday mike!

Of all the things I've believed in
I just want to get it over with
Tears form behind my eyes, but I do not cry
Counting the days that pass me by
I've been searching deep down in my soul
Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old
It feels like I'm starting all over again
The last three years were just pretend and I say
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to
I still get lost in your eyes
And it seems that I can't live a day without you
Closing my eyes and you chase my thoughts away
To a place where I am blinded by the light, but it's not right"

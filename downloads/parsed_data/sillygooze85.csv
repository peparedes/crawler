"event","Ahh another Sunday - the day of one of the last BYSO rehearsals.  I can't say I'm too disapointed or sad, I guess even with something that you're tired of and don't look forward to as much as you used to there's a point that you just realize ""wow I've been going to rehearsal every Sunday for the past 5 years and now it's about to end."" Yeah.. that's about the extent of it. 

lol - Well so far today has been another day of filling out paperwork and examining potential schedules and organizing thoughts about other such college activies outside of work.  It's sort of stressful but exciting at the same time .. the idea of not going back to high school in the fall is enough to jump and cheer and almost cry lol.  I think it's a healthy sort of happiness though.. like I'm completely prepared and excited to move on with my life toward the future and away from childhood.  Overall I think my childhood was good and fun while being quite productive.  I guess no one can ask for more than that! :-) Andd with the semester schedule I received in the mail and I can't even be worried about moving away from home.. gosh there are like week breaks every month and a half to two months.  

Mrs. Weaver told my english class the other day that if everyone isn't nervous about moving on with their lives away from high school and becoming more independent that they should be.  That seemed like such a silly statement.. like being nervous about it would be the most productive way to deal with it.  I'm sick of statements like that from teachers about that and about senioritis, being nostalgic, and not really being ready to leave high school.. it's just that whether we are or we aren't I personally don't appreciate being grouped in with everyone else.  Whenever I talk about any of it to my parents or Adam's parents they always say.. it's almost over... it's really just time to move on..  lol.. I guess that proves their statements wrong ..

I had a recital yesterday and played our oboe/oboe duet (with Amy), the oboe/clarient duet (with Laura), and this oboe quartet with all of Kathy's oboe students - Amy x2 lol, Molly and me .. my mom taped it.. and it sounded alright.. not bad .. there was definitely a bigger crowd there than I ever thought there would be .. it was kind of nice.. I think this chamber choir brought in most of the people.

I've finished all my home video collection DVDs - that was quite a project but fun at the same time.  Adam and I went to Jessica's 19th birthday the other night and I took one with Mr. Tokos' class and everyone had some fun with it.  My computer has been ordered and soon I'll be able to watch them on my 19 inch monitor kekeke!"

"event","I'm so dumb, why would a senior go and perform for random people at NYSSMA?  I'm not really nervous, but at the same time I want to do well.  Fortunately I'm only doing one solo and the other two are duets.. and then I'm accompanying my sister and her friend on their vocal duet.  I feel pretty comfortable with everything, I hope it all goes well.  Well, while I try to motivate myself to do my recording report I'll fill out a mindless survey thing - sounds fun right?!?

Friday: Well I think more fortunate now than I thought Friday morning school was canceled so Area All-State was canceled up in Ithaca.  BCC was open though, lol, that was good I had to talk to Sweeny about not being in class this Friday for the listening test.  He didn't have any problem with coming in at 8:00 and taking it before I leave for Philly, good!  

Adam came over after his physics class at 1:00 and we did a variety of constructive things!  yay for us haha!  We went through a ton of scholarships, although it's too bad we still haven't done the essays for them eeeekkk.  It was enough work though just filling out all the application portions.  Then I got the mail and saw that my picture from Conference All-State came.  It is really nice!  It's a picture right when we stood up at the end of the performance.  I also got the CV Newscaster and finally figured out what time that warrior celebration dinner thing was! That's kind of sad.. but.. hey at least I know now.  So I started to dig out ""good dinner music"" to play for the hour assigned including ""poplar hits from 1996"" haha Adam didn't think those we too suitable.  I think I'm on the right track though, I have most of it picked out.. and nothing that will take forever to prepare.  Then I went back to my home videos that I haven't worked on in forever because my mom has been hogging the machine.  I've successfully completed all the recents, almost :-).  

Alright on to Saturday...

I woke up at 6:45 and arrived at the school for Area All-State at 7:50.  When I got there Jana started to talk about how her mom called the festival and they said they were going to start rehearsal an hour early since Friday had been canceled.  Well... Mr. Brisk comes in and says that it wasn't mandatory, it was only if it was possible and I guess he said it wasn't possible.. So, started off on the wrong foot we were going to be there an hour late.. but since we didn't leave until 8:30 we were actually more like an hour and 15 minutes late.  When we walked into the building this woman looks at me (out of the other 10 students just getting there) and says.. ohh man it's good you got here, the conductor was going to hire an oboist.  I know it was a joke, but it wasn't that funny figuring I wasn't happy about being late.  Well, I run around and get ready and when I got to the rehearsal spot I see a few violin players standing outside .. one looks at me and says ohhh there's our oboe player.. you better get in there they're having a winds sectional and he's not happy you're late.  Well, so much for Mr. Brisk's it doesn't matter that we're late, they will understand statement.  I walk in and everyone basically cheers.  Speaking of a great way to start the day.  During the rehearsal everything started out ok at first, but then the conductor started to badger me about absolutely everything.  Now, I don't usually get shaken that easily.. but with 100 other people in the room, most of them who know me.. it was becoming extremely embarassing.  I have to say my focus started to go, and I just couldn't do it.  I was so flustered by lunch that I lost my meal ticket on the way over and ended up going back to the rehearsal space to pratice.  Without breakfast or lunch I started to become light-headed which made my situation worse.  Finally the concert came, and honestly I didn't completely ruin the concert like the conductor pretty much thought I would.  Although during the last couple movements that are really fast and loud I started to get a migraine.  But, it was finally over.  I found Adam and my mom and we left right away - when we got home we just ate dinner and watched Good Will Hunting - I'm glad that's over.  I suppose that's a sign that I'm not meant to be a performer by any means."

"event","Well, this whole middle school up at the high school thing is not working for Billie's senior schedule.  It is honestly a huge joke that everyone who comes in late has to park on one side of the building and walk to basically the opposite corner.  Unfortunately it doesn't end there, since someone sitting in the window needs to drill you on your destination, you have to sign in, then walk to the other end of the school to sign in the attendance office.  Now, if only these people could make my last few months somewhat tolerable.  nope.  I hope I didn't really make Mrs. Jenson angry today, Adam and I have always kind of hung out in the band room during lunch since the library is off limits and there is no way I'm going to sit in the over-crowded lunch room.  Oh well I guess.  Anyway, other than dealing with that stuff I had a fairly usual day -

I woke up at like 8:15 to eat breakfast, practice piano, read the ""money page,"" shower and get dressed.  Once I got to school of course after the nonsense I went to english to do lots of busy work since Weaver wasn't there again.  English is followed by lunch where Adam and I kind of got yelled at by Mrs. Jenson?.. I don't really know, she didn't tell us to leave, just didn't understand why we were there...  Anyway, after lunch Mrs. Buhl helped me to wheel a piano into one of the practice rooms so I had something to do for the next 42 minutes.  Strangely enough I was interupted by the nurse?  How random.  I guess she tracked me down to have an eye exam, well, I suppose it went well lol.  I could actually see the letters today, sometimes I just guess.. lately I've felt like I need glasses - but not today! haha...  7th period came - yay for economics.  Andrew makes everyone angry haha, Jacky's quote today on the way out of class .. ""now I can't blame people if they were born stupid, but Andrew wasn't born an asshole.""  Priceless

Ach... after economics was just chorus today.. we didn't really get anything accomplished which hmm isn't a fantastically huge surprise.  I went to see Mr. Brisk after chorus about NYSSMA stuff since I guess it's due tomorrow and I hadn't really been aware.  I just signed up for a piano solo since I need something to kind of focus on.. gives me a goal so I don't just not play .. and Laura and I are doing a clarinet and oboe duet, and Amy and I are playing a oboe duet yayaaya! :-) It'll be fun.  

After school Lea came over for a lesson, ahh she may have a short attention span but she's progressing pretty quickly.  SHe seemed more quiet than usual so I asked her if something happened in school and she told me that her teacher had promised them for like a week that today they would go sledding outside for the last hour of the day.. and of course as those things usually go they only went for 20 minutes.. I felt bad.. somehow school functions end up almost always as a little bit of a let down.  Adam and I just kind of hung until 7 when I went to give Mr. Scutt a piano lesson and he headed out to Grippen for an 8:15 game eeeek."

"event","As I sit for hours filling out the basic components of scholarship applications I feel a little irritated that all these $300-$500 rewards require endless materials.  It's like one of those drug commercials with a list of 3000 side effects but less humorous.  After submitting a transcript, two letters of recommendation (two very specified people of course), copies of financial information, the application itself, an essay that tells them how great they are for offering some money for desperate college bound high schoolers, a letter of recommendation from guidance, a personal interview, sometimes an audition (with a required accompaniest), promise to attend meetings or other ceremonies and performances if accepted, and my soul, I've finished one small chance at $300.  Alright, so it's not THAT bad, but kind of.  

Lately it feels as though I've been doing everything and nothing at the same time.  Perhaps it is just the thought of everything relating to college that makes me feel busy, well that and all my musical obligations.  Somehow everything seems to be conflicting lately, it's annoying when that happens like.. this Friday I potentially have to leave for Area All-State up in Ithaca at 10:30 not to arrive home until 9, 10?  However, in the case of a snow day and the festival being canceled Billie becomes happy.  Now, this isn't a conflict happily because my 20th century music class starts at 9 and ends at 10, if only everything could result in such bliss :-).  We're playing some great music that I haven't prepared as much as I should have = what I will be doing later.  Pictures in symphony this Sunday handicaps my original intent of skpping due to guilt.  I wanted to see Adam's senior game, but I may be lucky enough to have our section go first and leave after the first half.  After accidently scheduling two events on the same day - Feb. 7th I then realized that a third conflict (Area All-State) was also an issue.  Lol, I called and re-scheduled my audition at Mansfield for the 23rd and told the BU Sinfonia that I wouldn't be able to make the performance - eek I always feel bad when that happens. Since BCC was canceled last Wednesday due to massive amounts of snow our written and listening tests were pushed back a day.  Unfortunately this means that my listening tests falls on Friday the 13th - the same day the youth symphony takes an advanture down to Philly.  Hopefully Sweeney will take mercy and allow me to come earlier or something since we leave for Philly at 9 - hopefully.  Well, all in all everything is going to work out okay - I pray.

I suppose it's sad that I miss my boyfriend who has been at work for the last 4 hours, but that's not completely fair because I don't get to see him during the day at school and yesterday we weren't allowed out in the snoww! lol - but!  I want to go to college close to each other = Potsdam + Clarkson - too bad neither one of us has heard back yet, but I think it will work out.  Beats going out to western New York State where most of CV is headed.  That's what I'm trying to get away from - high school."

"event","Another almost two months have gone by since I've last written,and many things have changed - well.. some at least.  College for one, which of course is constantly on my mind, has changed in image a little for me.  After a couple more auditions (SUNY Fredonia and SUNY Potsdam) and more knowledge about programs and careers I've decided I'd like the life of a college professor in music history, for now.  I've come to his conclusion through a variety of factors such as performance would require endless hours of alone time in a practice room.  I don't mind being anti-social but I do want a life away from an instrument - and to successful as a performer?  I don't want to be owned by my oboe.  This may seem kind of dumb, since those are basically obvious factors regarding musical performers, but somehow I thought before I would want that.  I do love to perform in ensembles and definitely love music as a whole which is why music history seems like a good alternative.  Not that it's really an easier degree or career by any means but something I think I would end up enjoying more.  Well the other alternative is strictly education, which, yeah I don't want to do.  Somehow sitting all day in a high school giving basic instruction on every instrument while everyday arguing with administration about money and programs = not fun. I have gotten a letter of acceptance from SUNY Fredonia so far, which was fast only a week from my audition.  I also auditioned at Potsdam last Saturday and that went well, so hopefully I'll end up going there.  Potsdam is actually the only school I applied to that has an undergraduate program specializing in music history and literature and Adam wants to go to Clarkson = perfect yaya.  

Other than school stuff.. life has been going pretty well.  I'm definitely very happy with Adam, it's really great having someone who is always around and is a huge support.  People may think we depend on each other too much, but that is basically the definition of a best friend.  As for college, half the school is going to Buffalo, so there shouldn't be any judgement on wanting to go to the same location.  

As for today, no school of course since they got out at 11:30 and I got in at 11:00 I've just been practicing piano for our choir and that warrior dinner thing.  I'll probably re-read my music history assignment and practice sweeney musiccc and area all-state music ick"

"event","Ahh.. well this last week just kind of came and went .. Most of my finals are over at BCC, well at least some, somehow I've managed 5 finals with only 3 classes.  The sight-singing portion of my eartraining class went well, 100 on that one.. and I still have to do the written portion of intervals identification and 2 part harmonic dictation FUN! yay.. the first part of my theory final was incredibly difficult the whole class walked out after the exam in a daze, but I don't think it really went that poorly.  I still need to complete my 2 page anyalsis for Monday but hopefully it won't be impossible.  Then of course there's Sweeny's test, well, studying is usually basically impossible because you never know what you will get.. but I'll look things over since he drops the lowest test score I have a safety net since I have an A in his class with the tests I have taken already.  In high school everything is a joke of course.. government is such a pain.. he gave us a quiz as a punishment the other day.. uhhg, power hungry teachers drive me crazy.  Kind of like gym class = should not be graded.  It still makes me laugh how I missed 5 straight days of school and had nothing other than 2 tests to make up.. you know.. you'd think I would have homework or reading or something to look over.. nope it's high school...

As ironic as this sounds, I have been waiting impatiently since basically 9th grade to get out of this place.. but now I finally understand why people don't look forward to it as much .. this year has been so stressful.. and not for the reasons why school can be stressful with work and such.. I thought I was one of the unusual ones, somehow who knew exactly what she wanted to do after high school.. and now I'm not so sure.  Well of course I want to go to college, and major in music.. but where will I end up going? I have no idea.. and whatever denial I was in about not going to care if Adam and I were far apart is beginning to fall apart.  Everything is just so confusing, where I'll end up going, who will accept me, how I'll pay for it, where I'll get money from.. everyone is dealing with it I guess..

Christmas is almost here and I don't feel it yet, of course my family has done all the decorating the tree all the works.. but it's almost like i'm fighting time, even the good things.. I love Christmas for everything it represents but I fear the future and what it may hold.  My emotions are all mixed up, I'm happy in general, I'm not in a state of depression or anything.. but I feel like I may be acting that way.. I feel lazy.  It's probably just personality because I'm working all the time, I'm practicing, working things out, planning for the future, whatever kind of school work I have.. I don't know.. 

Maybe I'll go out and do some Christmas shopping today since Adam's at work for another few hours.. lol not being very liked in high school = less gifts to buy.. ahh high school will never change, there's just not a real place for me.. Adam is all I need :-) he makes me happy"

"event","After spending a month of a pretty intense practice schedule including 3 1/2 days in Rochester for 9 hour All-State rehearsals tomorrow is the day.  Now, that makes it sound too important, it is, but, it's not everything.  I've always looked to the Ithaca School of Music as my number one choice for a variety of reasons.. the location is perfect, the campus is great, the program is exactly what I want for undergraduate work.. but it is extremely expensive.  If I nail my audition tomorrow I could not only get accepted but be selected for scholarship money and be on my way to fulfill my dreams.  However, if I'm just not what they are looking for, the SUNY schools are great music schools, and I don't even have to stay there for the full four years if it's not for me.  I'm going to play the first movement of the Mozart Oboe Concerto in C, the entire Marcello, and the last movement of Britten's Metamorphoses .. I'm going to focus on making everything as musical and passionate as possible, including scales.  Hopefully the weather won't hold us up too much.. I'm going to head out with my mom and Adam since my dad has a run tonight.

To focus on something less stressful and something that has happened already I'll talk about All-State.  I went into it not with a bad attitude, but not exactly with an excited one.. I have good and well exausting memories to carry with me.  My roomies were great, I was lucky to have really nice people to room with unlike the 5 other oboists all of whom I guess will someday be famous performers .. or so they say.. our conductor was Robert W. Smith a big time composer of our time, so we were pretty lucky to have him.. we performed his 2nd symphony, actually premiered since no group has actually put the entire piece together yet.  I learned a lot about music in those few days, no technical tricks or how to practice or anything like that.. but how to look at music, how to really dig into it and find the passion and emotional meaning in it.  I think that will really help me at my audition tomorrow..   And with All-State brought a sort of surprise english horn solo, alright, that's not fair to say because I got the music and it was marked solo, I just didn't realize it was like the entire piece and as exposed as it was.  No matter how I think I played, everyone thought it was great, the Eastman Theatre helped I think :-)  Mr. Smith gave me the compliment of bearing my soul for the solo, I think that was one of the best things someone could tell me at this point in my playing.  Although I didn't attend the nightly disco dances or really interact a lot of the other students (I just wanted to talk to my mommy and Adam when I could lol) I met some great people and had an overall nice experience."

We passed through my sister's birthday, also the day that my great-grandmother passed away.  Adam joined me at the funeral, we all went down to Dickson City in PA for her to be buried by her first husband.  At 94 years old.. I guess you can't complain too much..

Finally the end of school, the end of regents/finals.. I hope everything went okay, I feel like this year I've shot any chance of landing in the top 10 of our class.. I guess we'll see..

Searching for a job hasn't been easy, still trying pretty hard .. with a couple friends trying to get me a job at Phil's Chicken House and Wal-mart.. at the moment I'm stuck at the Giant, I shouldn't say that, if i get another job I will still keep my job there, and I've met some really nice people.. it's just that I only get 12 hours a week.. and it would be nice to at least cashier.. anyway.. I shouldn't complain because I still have a few friends among many many people looking for any sort of job..

Adam is playing oboe pretty often, he's improving everyday, it will be a lot of fun to play together in band next year.. and i'm also excited about Mr. Brisk letting me conduct a piece.. good times.. Karl is going to start piano with me.. and Corinne (one of Mattie's friends) is going to begin oboe.. that's right.. the CV oboe legacy will continue.. lol.. hmm..

In my battle to lose some weight.. you know.. like 5-10 pounds.. make me feel a little better about myself.. well yeah, anyway, it's a battle and i feel like i'm not getting anywhere.. i like to eattt.. hmm 

I want to accomplish a lot this summer.. on top of working and getting another job.. i want to:

*Figure out what i want to play for college auditions and PRACTICE!
-Mozart Oboe Concerto
-the Marcello
-Telemann? Handel? Hydan??
*Make TONS of oboe reeds, I have to get better at this!
*Play lots of english horn, find some new music
*Mess around with piano - Variations on Twinkle Twinkle (Mozart), Duets with Mrs. Fako, some jazz stuff?!?
*Learn how to play recorder, that's right, recorder lol, i went and wrote down a bunch of level 6 pieces out of the manuel today, next year NYSSMA = recorder, saxophone, violin ;-) - not that i want to begin on those solos NOW.. but gives me an idea of stuff to look at.. BAROQUE :-)
*Read my entire theory book
*Organize papers of all sorts, mostly BCC notes and such
*College visitis? Lessons at Ithaca?? 
*Work out, eat less
*Have a lot of fun and stay in close touch with friends
*Maybe do some reading for fun

Looks like i'll be busy, meanwhile i need to decide about cheerleading...... eee.. i just don't know, will i have time?? It's such a committment.. i want to.. ah i'll figure it out eventually I still have time.."

"event","Tuesday: Nothing at all happened in school, seriously, no homework, no classwork, it's amazing that we need to attend.  My sister and my mom went to New York City for Mattie's sixth grade trip, also happened to be my mom's birthday.  Well, it sounded like a really frusterating trip.  A lot of waiting, lack of time for eating real food, and too much fit into one day were the complaints mostly.  Lol, i guess on the way home, Mrs. Bucci realized that some kids in the back of the bus were playing truth or dare.  Well, she storms to the back of the bus with a tape in her hand, telling them that the camera on the bus had captured everything, and unless they confess what exactly had happened she was going to play the tape for the entire bus and then tell their parents.  Even though this seems like a far-fetched story, I guess they bought it, and a couple of the girls were crying.  Eeee, seems like kind of a mean thing to do to some 6th graders, let them have their innocent fun I think.

I guess my grandma is continually becoming worse and worse.  She's having trouble keeping up with what is real and what is imaginary, and is just so tired and weak.  It's really hard on my mom, it's just so hard to see someone suffer so.. at least, at the very least, she's not experiencing a ton of pain. .. As she would always tell Adam and me, growing old is no pleasure.. :-(

Since my mom and sister were gone all day until 9, I took the opportunity to make my mom a college for her birthday. I think it turned out really nice, I went through old photo albums and just took pictures of the two of us since I was an infant.  I scanned them all and everything, and found a poem that was pretty well suited for it.. she liked it a lot :-)

Yesterday morning was a fun gym class of walking in circles around the tennis court because it was too wet even to play tennis, let alone softball.  Debbie and I chatted some, about next year (a topic of much discussion) and about college in general.  She was saying how she doesn't think she'll talk to almost anyone from CV after high school, I must agree with her, at this point I doubt I'll even go back for reunions.  It's nice to talk to her one on one.. something we don't do a lot of..

Later in the day I went to my interview at the giant (yup, the only place out of 15 to give me an interview).  I basically just walked in, the guy asked me if I had good grades and attendence, then gave me a ""math test"" - consisted of addition, subtraction etc.  he didn't even look at it when I cam back.  Lol, he goes ""100"" and starts setting up times for me to start.  Alright, so I have a job at the giant, my job title is a ""packer"" but at least it's a start, maybe i'll be able to work up to something better, or find a different job.. we'll see...

Later in the evening was the ice cream social.  Alright, I guess it was nice, and people seemed to enjoy it, but it was 3 hours long, and I wasn't even there the whole time (the elementary kids played first and I didn't go - whoops).  Ahh well people got a kick out of our jaws thingy, and at 10 when it was finally over it was pouring rain.  Unfortunatly Adam and I could only find a parking place about 3 blocks away from the school, that's right, we were completely soaked by the time we made it to the car.  I had the huge red band folder acting as a shield to my oboe, it actually worked quite well. lol

Today wasn't much of anything again in school, other than a call down to take a picture of the newscaster.  I guess Mr. Spena wrote a article about me, Mr. Brisk let me read it, seems pretty nice - maybe I'll get another if i'm lucky enough in September... hmm.. anyway, I made up two chorus lessons, a real treat, especially the first one where it was only Mrs. Buhl and myself... eeee... hmmm..

Tonight I was just very lazy, Adam and I just kind of layed around.. played some oboe.. and hmm.. ate some cheese cake.. that's how it should be all the time.. lol"

"event","Well, after an entire day of research papers, french, social studies, health, and mostly research papers :-) it was nice to not have to do research papers.  Hopefully Ms. Halpern will not eat it and eat me too, a nice grade would be appreciated.  Anyway, I had to make up garbage classwork today such as a social studies test and gym classes.  I didn't realize what a joke making up swim classes were.  After all the chat about having to swim 500s and whatnot I was not looking forward to it too much.  Well the real truth is that like 600 people were in the pool and no one was swimming, I guess the plan was to walk?!? 80 short lengths of the pool.  The stupid part of it is that they say you can do 80 in a half hour, but we were only allowed in the pool for 20 minutes.  When I get out I ask the teacher if it will count for two classes (my gym teacher wasn't around of course) and he's like.. hmm did you walk 80 lengths?  Well of course I said yes, I don't know, I'll just fight with Price like usual.  She'll give me the grade I want eventually.  

I have been feeling so gross lately.  I went to the hospital on Friday to have blood taken, which by the way was hidious because so few people know how to actually take blood in a non-painful fashion.  My levels are probably just off, and my thyroid is not working or something fun like that so they'll just boost my medication.  Hopefully.  

Adam and I went over to my grandma's house today after we did some bottle wrapping for his dad.  She was having a dinner for my mom's birthday which is tomorrow.  After we ate there was this huge conversation about Adam's speeding ticket and all the times they have gotten into trouble with traffic laws.  Some very interesting stories such as.. going 80 on the vestal parkway, running into a dresser on the highway, lying about missing stop signs or speeding.. and so much more.  

I figured some things out about myself today, and I'm closing whatever feelings I had left about other things/people.  So basically today was a good day emotionally.

I also realized that I will have 3 finals this year, gym (joke), health (joke), and english of which she said we cannot study for.  On top of that all I have are two regents which are french (no need to study) and social studies, basically the only thing out of all this i'll really have to look over.  In other words, my year in school is pretty much over and I'm very much looking forward to summer.  I'm going to make the very most I can out of it.  My goals are 1. build up relationships with friends 2. practice like crazy, preparing for college auditions 3. get in shape and stay in shape 4. have a lot of adventures 5. FUN"

"event","Well since Wednesday I went to the award ceremony thingy which was very very silly.  I had only gone because Mr. Brisk had told me he would going, but alas he did not show up.  The next day I yelled at him and he laughed, but I guess he had some class about drugs and violence in school that he had forgotten about.  He was kind of frusterated about going, I got the impression he didn't listen much to what they were saying.  Real long attention span ;-)  Well anyway, so i received my music achievement award from Buhl who seemed extremely nervous to be there.  I also somehow managed a gym achievement award which totally confuses me.  I received one last year too?!?  Come on, I know I complain a lot, but I hate gym.  After the ceremony Adam and I met up with Jacky, Beth, and Jessica H to eat some cookies and such.  Yay for chocolate chip cookies.  Jacky took us back to my house so we could rehearse for the honor society ceremony on Thursday.  It went much better than the day before and it ended up going well at the ceremony the next day.

I had gotten there extra early due to a softball practice of Mattie's.  When I walked into the multi-purpose room at Chenango Bridge Mr. Brisk and Mrs. Gallo were trying to set up and it was funny talking to the two of them.  Speaking of completely random people.  Other than a somewhat freak-out during the procession the ceremony went fine, and none of the inducties tripped walking across the stage :-)  

Last night Craig, Alex, Chris, Jacky, Jessica, Katie, Adam, and Debbie slept over.  We played Baulderdash which is quite an entertaining game.  My parents and sister made funnel cakes so while we were singing on Mattie's E-Kara program thingy we ate lots of fat.  It was fun, and we're thinking about making plans for another murder mystery dinner. 

Well finally, today I did very little.  At about 12 everyone had left and some family of mine came over to have a sort of birthday dinner for my mom.  Afterward, Adam and I went out to Vestal in hopes of finding gifts for birthdays coming up.  I found a little something for Mattie, but I'll continue looking, I have a few days left."

Well I had the usual piano lessons, Christina's lesson went well and she is almost at level 3! :-)  Then I went to my piano lesson, and basically just played the music for the national honor society ceremony since it's so last minute, but Mrs. Fako doesn't believe it will be a problem.  After my lesson I went up to pick up Adam to come to my house to have chicken speidies.  After we ate Adam received yet another oboe lesson, it went much much better on Buster.  I think it's easier to play on the plastic, which would be why it's a student oboe. Makes since.  I was playing along on Lucy my Loree and realized what good pitch Adam has! I was so impressed, there are people I am forced to play with who after 3 days of playing he has better pitch than!  No names.. but here's the hint D*t**r'* D*u*h**r have you figured it out? ;-)  Once we were finished oboeing lol, Jacky called and wanted to come over to rehearse.  Yeah, it definitely went a lot better than it did yesterday, she'll come over tonight to run through things one last time before tomorrow.

Later in the evening I talked to Alex a little bit about his girlie troubles.  Adam and I were trying to give him advice, but I think it may be too late.  I feel bad, but there will be someone else right?!?"

We went over to my grandma's house for like a memorial day dinner, and later in the evening Jacky came over to rehearse her song for the National Honor Society induction ceremony.  After a short practice we began talking about summer plans, including a trip to Virginia Beaccch. Yeah, that would definitely be amazing, and I think it is within reason for the things we would like to do.  Hopefully everyone will get permission and the planning process will begin! :-)

I don't usually let myself sleep in that late, someting about feeling worthless or something lol.  Well I'll need to do constructive things today to make up for it, homework, lots of Mozart.  I was happy to receive Mozart's Oboe Concerto from Mr. Brisk the other day, he just randomly ordered some oboe music and yay it was the one I was looking for. :-) And I have some piano things to work on, for the national honor society induction ceremony I agreed to play the procession, and to accompany Jacky on a solo in the middle.  On top of that Mrs. Buhl found it necessary to dig out old winter concert music like ""pipin"" and ""lovers love the spring"" that I'll have to practice up again, yuck yuck yuck.  Along with my duet and my mozart variations on twinkle twinkle little star :-) :-)

I am kind of sad that symphony is over for the year, it is also sad to think that I have been giving my sunday afternoon to rehearsal for the last 4 years.. oh well, I will miss Lisa, someone always leave me.

"event","I was reading some of my journal entries and other peoples from well maybe a year and a half ago my entire world has changed.  Well, maybe not everything, but I think I look at things a little differently now, I've matured? I hope I haven't hardened, but I think that may be part of it.  A lot of ups and downs this year, especially with people, people who miscalulate a situation and go crazy.  Sometimes I think people almost find a reason to hate me, I would rather feel any other emotion than hate.  Too many comments, talking behind my back, basically cruelties hurt me so much, I got so incredibly emotional.  I have learned though, how to deal with that emotion in a more constructive way, yelling at people in anger doesn't ever get someone anywhere.  I have saved some friendships this time around by avoiding the yelling and just asking constructive questions.  Thank you Jessica, Craig, Jacky and Debbie for being there, taking the inicitive to talk to me when I did not know what to do, when I had thought there was no chance, when I had thought you were gone forever.  And of course, thank you Adam, for sticking by my side the entire time, never doubting me, and supporting me with absolutely anything I wanted to do, or had to do for my emotional health.

I don't know what to say about Melissa, I am so incredibly hurt and confused by her actions.  Running to Allison and Keely did not help the situation in the least, they have been trying to find reasons to talk about me and hurt me since we last talked, since Adam and I got together I guess. Remember, when it was completely my fault that neither one of us were working on our friendships very hard, and they made it clear that they did not want to work it out coughBostoncough.  Enough of living in the past though, I guess it's just hard not to compare the two events.  But I guess this is not the first time Melissa has gone crazy over something like my situation, Jacky for example.

Well I actually feel better after writing this, it somehow gives me some closure on my ""issues"" but not completely, I'm still waiting for an email from Melissa.  I'm not sure if she'll ever send one, but I guess it says a lot either way.  

To end on a happy note, i'm going to remember some happy times this year, figuring the year is almost over.  How about new years eve, everyone fighting over dan lol.  All our ""nights"" like nostalga, plato ""BYOCC"", card night, egyptian rat screw for hours :-) all the times at Melissa's house, my house for the foosball/Carl going down the laundry shoot time haha, our dances, great times at jr. dinner dance, and great pictures lol.  And of course our murder mystery dinner... and everything else.. I am glad all our memories do not have to be looked back on in scorn, even if melissa and i will never be friends again, I am so sorry everyone, for disapointing you I guess.  But I think it's time for everyone to forgive and forget because it's my personal problems and everyone needs to move on myself included."

Well I have a concert next Sunday at 3:00 at west middle school for all you classical music lovers! hehe .. umm which i know consists of like zero people who read this ;-)  but that's okay.. rap is good music too 

hmm as for feelings i suppose i've been pretty happy for the most part.. i've been down in certain areas, but i'm really going to work hard on trying to make them better.. guess i'm done boring you all lol.."

"event","Well.. yesterday was the first day of basketball cheer try-outs.. about a normal turn-out I think.  There were like close to 40 girls trying out for JV and I think about 18 trying-out for varsity.  Yucky.. they're boring though.. and cuts aren't going to be until next Saturday.. oh well.  I just really hope I make it, because I only put down varsity, I don't know if I'd want to go back down to JV.. ahh hopefully I won't have to worry about it.  Anyway.. I also did well on my math test that I took Thursday, ahh what a relief I really needed a good grade.. now my average will be okay, at least compared to what it would have been if i didn't get a good test grade. 

Today Jono, Adam, Craig, and Alex came over to work on english.. let's say we worked on the piece of junk for about 3 hours getting to the point where we were conversing in literary terms lol.. jj .. (kinda).. after we had had enough we went outside and played basketball and ate some tastey french fries.. hahahaaa.. okay that's about it.. o yea.. last night someone talked to me.. i was excited!

"event","Dude, it's been like months since I last updated.  It's reasonable though, I've been pretty busy with cheering, and school mostly.  I had an awesome season cheering even if we only ended up with 2nd.  I'm definitely going to miss coach this season A LOT.. along with all the other girls that aren't coming back.  Anyway.. on to new stuff..

Hey! Billie finally completed her own oboe reed!! *cheers*!  Umm.. I'm happy to say today was a good math day.  I feel good with how I did on the test.. hopefully the results are just as positive, cuz i need it!! yes i do!  i'm awfully sleepy tonight and i donno why really.. hmm.. well socially things have been sort of confusing.. it's hard to say much of anything here cuz i'm afraid of who reads.. i'm just trying to figure out like a million different feelings for people.. haha and umm.. the 6? .. how pathetic .. and i don't even know what i want to do about any of it.. mostly for fear of hurting peoples feelings .. kind of trapped in a way

Other than that.. i've just been contemplating priorities .. i suppose Clapper has had an effect on me? .. i donno .. but i get mad at myself for focusing so much on cheerleading.. it's just fun for me i guess.. and there's always a lot to think about for it so it's always on my mind .. school is super important too and i always do everything i need to.. but i just wonder how much better i'd be doing if i could put in a good couple hours studying and stuff.. then there's my music.. i feel like i should be so much further.. but there's just no time.. and there's nothing that i want to take out of my life to leave time.. so i'm in a jam.. eventually i'll figure things out"

"event","First day back!  Well, even though at the end of the day I felt like I had been in school for months already, it really wasn't completely awful.  Of course the day started off wonderfully when we were assigned our lockers and they were BOLTED!  Anyway, before lunch they had unbolted the entire line of lockers except for mine.  lol.. how ironic.. i mean my lockers wasn't even at the end.. it was right in the middle of them all!  Although that ended up not being a problem because as I was walking down the hall toward Keely's locker cuz she had told me I could put my stuff in there, the vice principal was talking to Craig.. his locker was still bolted too.  Soo! He let me into my locker to drop off my huge books that I'm going to have to carry to class each day! haha

When I got into first period there wasn't a huge shocker.  All they had done for math was combine two classes.. by eliminating the worst students? nope! By jamming 40 of us into one small classroom.. lol.. it will be an interesting year with that many students and such a hard course that Clapper is just IN LOVE WITH. lol.. he tried pretty hard to be really intimidating today.. maybe some people will be scared and drop.. who knows.  That definitely will be a big challenge this year though!! ahhh

2nd period was gym class.. okay so i definitely have like the worst gym class.  Thank goodness Al is in there with me so there's someone to talk to!  I don't like even KNOW all the freshman guys or girls. Oh well, this whole grading thing is a little whack too.. suck up time! lol

I'm really excited about science this year, my class is real cool and Mrs. Somerwil sounds like she's up for ""fun learning"" Along with that it sounds easy! She gives tons of bonus points for turning in labs early that you have a week to complete.  (pumping arm, YES *Keely*) hehe

Study hall was great with our little math study group hehe.. I like that a lot.. unfortunately I only have that study hall twice every six days.. kinda complicated right? .. well not really.. but i hope my other study hall has a lot of people that i work good with too! I'll find out tomorroww!

Social studies sounds wicked good too!  Already i love Crane's teaching style, because in his words he's a ""story telling teacher"" therefore no boring notes to copy off the overhead.  He will actually TALK to us about history and have open discussions! dude .. it's definitely more like a college class than high school.. I think i'll learn soo much more this way.  Not that the class is going to be easy, I just think I'll enjoy it.

French is kind of saddd!! Okay, there's only 14 of us, compared to our class of 28 last year.. and i loved my class last year so i'm going to miss all the kids who are in the other class 4th period.  Another thing is that I had Malloy for 2 years! and she was the bestest!.. this new teacher doesn't have much personality.. ooooorrr cats, or posters, or homework on the board, or bonus points, or candy, bad accent.. right KeelY??

English.. well english.. test today.. luckily it didn't seem too hard so i'm hoping i did fairly well on it.  We were assigned an essay tonight.. duhh yucky essays suck.  It didn't take real long, i think i answered it okay.. soo i guess that's really not much to complain about haha.. Yeaah Fed seems kind of intense, but again i think i'll learn a lot from him.

Lastlyyyy was chorus today.. goodness goodness goodness is all i have to say for that.... we'll just see how it goes...

Practice tonight consisted of mostly going over cheers and sidelines for the game on saturday.. coach didn't seem real happy about how they look.  That makes me a little nervous!! Well we have tomorrow to perfect them.. pep rally tomorrow too! that means uniforms lol..

That was my day!!! Not bad i think!"

Last night I went to JC field days with Nichole, Sam, Adam, Brandon, and Craig.  Yeah, it was an okay time.  It was fun hanging out with everyone, but basically impossible to do much more than stand amist a huge crowd of people or sit on an overly crowded hill. lol .. We saw a ton of people we knew though, that waz coool.  After the fireworks, which almost gave Adam a seizure. haha.. Sam and I went back to my house.  We just hung out and talked alll good all good :-) 

Today I didn't do much until practice at 4.  Where we finalized what we were doing at the pep rally (I think it will be cute) .. and our usual dose of conditioning.  Not a whole lot more to say .. other than some random thoughts:

~I feel like school has really already started even though there's still a day left
~I'm feeling pretty good about a couple friendships that may be on the mend after some tought times
~Adam is almost physic.. or .. i'm just a predictable person lol
~Alex,Adam,and Craig's website is wicked funny and you all should go and visit it sometime
~I need to remember my two books for english,my FINISHED english study guides,my lock,my book covers,pens,and a notebook for the first day of school lol

"event","Well, it's been awhile since I've written in here.  I guess I haven't had a lot to write because my life has been fairly monotonous.  For the past couple weeks I've basically just been at the gym, everything there is going pretty well I think.  I mean, I think I'm improving and having a pretty good time with it.  Also gives me something to think about, so I don't go out of my mind thinking about stupid things.  Along with other things I do have some good news, I finished all that english junk the other night.  That was a relief, I swear he's probably only going to count it as a completion grade and I spent many hours working on the stupid study guides and reading the books.

I suppose this isn't a great time to be writing cuz I'm not in a real good mood, but what are journals good for if not to vent right?  Venting probably isn't the right word, I just lose self confidence so quickly.  If I didn't I probably would be like estatically happy all the time, wouldn't that be just wonderful?  Isn't it an awful feeling when you just don't feel like you're number one in anyone's book?  Maybe not, maybe most people don't mind coming in number 2,3,4..  God, I'm so ungrateful.  It just feels like everytime I turn around I lose someone else, and right when I gain someone, they're gone again.  I'm just an ungrateful brat though, because everyone always tells me how great my life is .. oh well.. i'm sure i'll find some new people and be happier again for awhile.. happy days"

Anyway, double sessions of cheerleading have taken place all this week, and try-outs were yesterday.  Let's just say the week was reallly really long and hard, but the final results were good.  I moved up to varsity this year. :-)  It's going to be really challenging, but there's going to be a lot of fun too.  On Wednesday and Thursday Keely stayed over here, it was nice.. well.. I mean probably kind of scary cuz my family is weird (including myself) but hehe.. 

Anyway!  Today was the first day of actual practicing and I think it went pretty well.  We discussed some events coming up, did some stunting which still needs a little moving around, some conditioning, and sidelines.  Let me tell you, it's soo much better doing sidelines this year when I'm the one teaching instead of learning. lol.. oh yeah, and for my sideline position I'm on the complete opposite end from where I was last year.  Well, I guess I don't have a lot more to say other than all that, but I'm excited for this season and I hope it's a real good time."

Like 10:30 .. haha that's early considering I haven't been to bed before 12 in about 2 months.  Needless to say I didn't fall asleep until about 11 or so.

Woke up bright and early .. like 7:10 this morning.  Took a shower and was off to cheer try-outs! yay! hehe coughhackwheeze.. try-outs are not Fun!  Anyway, there were about as many people as I expected.  Not huge cuts this year, I think between JV and Varsity there will be about 8.  Not many not many.. this morning we ran, stretched, arm drills, jump drills, taught the spirt dance and did it about a million times.. then sit ups, push ups, v-ups, leg lifts, dips, stamina (woah spelling issues) .. jumps, and well stretched again.. ready for the second sesson! ahhhhhh hehe"

After I came home I went online and was talking to Adam and we decided to rent a movie.  Well, I wanted to see what lies beneath cuz i missed it in the theatre.. but i suppose it's not out on video yet? If it is, I just didn't see it.. so we rented The Skulls (-:  Anyway, good times watching the skulls even if there are certain things about the movie that must be brought up to the writer. lol

Today I was so tired and I have no idea why really.  Needless to say I didn't get much of anything accomplished.. at all.  Basically saying it was a waste of a day cuz i wasn't up to anything lol.  Although I finally dragged myself out of the house to go see The Others with Sam,Manda,Mandi,Erica,and Mary.  I really liked it.. I thought it had a cool twist, however it kind of reminded me of the sixth sense.  hehe.. the whole car ride home manda,mandi, sam and i completely figured out the entire movie. ;-)

So tomorrow is our last day of freedom before sports start. Emotions: excited/sad/stressed .. why stressed.. hehe cuz just the thought of school stresses me out.. and well school comes right after sports right? ... like no one is online tonight.. must be a big party lol jj .. that's all for now"

Also last night I went to touch of texas w/Keely.  It was funny imitating how other people dance.. especially the guys and girl dancing together.  Those with no style ;-)  Although I was disapointed that all the people who were going to go decided not to at the last minute.

Adam called me too this morning just to check up on things and stuff since I was a little upset last night.  That was soo sweet.. i donno what i'd do without him sometimes.. and i guess i'm just glad that he wasn't upset with me cuz i thought he was for awhile.  Brandon's been a great friend lately too .. i guess this stuff has been on my mind cuz of losing someone that meant a lot to me .. i understand that though people grow up and grow apart. 

I need to stop analying my life right now though, because everything is going to change in just 2 days when I lose my life to cheerleading.  I'm pretty excited, if not a little sad for the beginning of the end up the summer.. hehe pick up on that one?  Anyway, along with everyone else I'm very curious to know the outcome and in some ways I'd like today to be next Friday so I'd know everyone who was on the team and everything.

Wednesday: Well hehe, I guess I could just type ""see Keely's journal"" hehe girl I think you covered everything that happened! And you're so sweet! I love you even MOrE.. and you're more awesomer! So Billie wins! :-) hehe ... Anyway, likes Keelz said we hung out and talked, went swimming (you're right girl, i'm not much of a swimmer, the only ways to get me in the pool is there to be 90 degree temp and above for a week straight, there to be really hott guys in there lol, a heater in the pool, or well, if you throw me in :-).. then went for a walk w/my sis in like 100 degree weather, needless to say we didn't get very far.  Once we were home my mom showed up with my cousin's little mutt cuz they were going to be out for the night and since it was so little it couldn't stay home by itself (well not really a mutt, but you'll know how i feel about dogs lol) and it was even cute in it's ugly little way.  Once Keelz went home I just went to my piano lesson yay.. and umm that's bout it!

Thursday: Well.. okay so I finally got myself out of my little stressed out mode of answering the stupid questions to animal farm and just finished the book.  Yes, I still have to answer the questions, but at least i finished the book.. on to a separate peace yay! lol .. and you know what? i went in my pool again! that must be like a record for me.. two days in a row!  Later that night I went to Touch of Texas with Gabe,Meg,Meaghan,Amanda, and Kelly Klein.  It was alright, but we all just weren't in that crazy dancing kinda mood hehe .. oh! I saw Kelli VerValin (sorry hun if i mutilated ur last name!) there.. that was really cool i haven't seen her in forever! You so sweet girl! :-) 

Today: Well I just hung out around here cuz I had to watch my sister.  I made a notebook of her forth grade papers for her (awh what a wonderful sister lol) anyway, later I went to my grandma's house with my parents.. and umm nothing to spectatular after that!"

So we just talked and caught up with some stuff, then drove the four-wheeler down to her grandparents house to go for a swim.  Oh yeah, and I taught her the one cheer from camp that we might be using in try-outs.

Last night I went out with John,Kelly,Terry, Derek, and Kyle mini golfing which was pretty funny.  John would get really mad and pound his club into the ground, and well Kyle would just hit the ball really hard, i swear he almost killed me a couple times.  Anyway, needless to say none of us made par at the end of the game lol, so we were all losers ;-) .. After that the 6 of us piled into Terry's car and went to see Rush Hour 2 .. I thought it was funny.. and the cuts shown at the end were great.

Friday: Went to Speidi fest w/Jess, we had a good time.  Although when we were going in I was asked twice how old I was, and almost given an ID tag in case I lost Jessica. lol .. there really weren't that many people there, I was expecting it to be like completely packed.  Kind of disapointing that the balloons didn't go up waaah hehe .. good times though.. especially scaring Jess's friend Sarah. ;-)

Saturday: Hmm.. well my uncle Mark and Stacey came over for his birthday.  Julie came over too and we all just ate and talked blah blah blah hehe..

Sunday: Went blueberry picking with my parents and sister, then out to see Dr. Dolittle II.  It was a pretty cute movie I thought.  Anyway, when I got home I called Adam.  We talked and it was decided, well mostly by me, that basically he just didn't really have time for a relationship right now.  I know this is going to make a certain someone very happy, well not that he doesn't have time for a relationship, but that we broke up.  As for how I feel about it, yeah, I'm a little upset I suppose, but it was more frusterating trying to make it work.  It's just too bad that it couldn't.  Afterward Nick called.   We haven't talked in SOO long, like since school ended is how long really, so that was cool.  Guess that's pretty much it, not a whole lot of amazing stuff has been happening lately.

Keely and I got there about the same time as Allison and Katie so we ended up in the same dorm.  That was really cool, see the dorm had two rooms and like a louge area separating the rooms.  Anyway, the food there was pretty good for the most part. lol, dinners were to best, and well lunches were kind of greasy.  The spirit dance this year was pretty cute I thought, although we didn't get to do it nearly as much as last year.  

There were only 12 of us there for JV, so we obviously had a really small team.  Stunting was probably the most stressful thing of the entire camp.  Although I was placed in a toss class w/Jessica Freeh, Brandi, Andrea, Alise, and Kata, and that was pretty good.  I actually got nominated for all-american in that class.  Ahh it was scary, but I did a twist toss! go Billie lol.  Speaking of which there was a team there called the South Billie's! No joke! It was so funny, they would start chanting ""Oo ah, you wish you were a Billie"" and I'd do a dance to it. :-)  

We didn't win any of the championship things this year, but at least during all our evalutions we got superior ribbons.  Yeah, so I was definitely not expecting to be selected for the all-american team.  Talk about complete surprise, I tried out this year thinking it was basically a joke cuz I don't tumble or anything.  So I'm just like.. yeahh whatever, I'll just have a good time out there.  So when they called me name saying i was selected it was total shock.

Katie - ""I'm gonna go hit the pot"" .. riiiight hehe, that was the funniest thing.. well other than the fact that Al booted me while we were j'ing out for our final cheer. lol, that was hilarious, I definitely went flying a way.  So from now until try-out I'll be contemplating who will be trying out for football and who will be making the team.  I'm anxious to know!  I know we'll be weaker this year, but I'm hoping that Ryann is a good coach and that we'll be able to rise to a stronger level more quickly.

Mem's for all my girlies at cheer camp
- Sarah's facials (wide mouth and crossed eyes)
- Katie's stories
- The garbage can incident
- Kelly and Heather a.k.a. the MM (morning motivators lol)
- Our Jeremiah (sp.) buddy cheer
- Chelsea (barking)in order to get odd looks of course
- Singing in the shower and getting caught by someone i didn't know was in there! haha
- Singing row row row your boat in a round
- Heather and Katie with their uhh.. poses
- The REALLY long spirit stick award ceremonies

and everything else of course! lol .. getting sleepy! Good NIIIIGHT!"

After we left we went out to Sears to buy some paint to redo grandma's old bedroom and now her double bed is in my room so I needed a new comforter.  I want to get a down comforter, but it's kind of hard to find them now since it's summer.  Like in a month or so I'll find one I want, until then I just got a flowered one.  I think it's pretty and it matches my room pretty good.

Later today we went out to Vestal to check out this car.  Ahh it's decent for the price, but it has quite a few miles and is white so we're probably going to keep looking.  

Well, I talked to Adam today.. I don't really know what's going on with us.  I guess that's kind of a lie, I do know, but I don't like it.  The bottom line story is basically that his parents believe I'm too old for him, and that we're allowed to see each other, but they're going to make it really hard.  If that makes any sense... so our relationship will consist of not really seeing or talking to each other very much.  Ahh it's not going over that well with me.. i don't know.. I like Adam a lot but I don't know if I can live with the fact that he's like kind of within reach but not really.  Ahh enough babble.. I'm out"

"event","Well, today was pretty uneventful.  I woke up this morning around 10:45 to see that my grandma was moving all her stuff out.  My uncle Jerry and Chris were here helping her out.  Yeah.. due to some issues around here she's moving down to my grandma Cheechalk's house.  Anyway, so I watched Krysta for awhile when they were loading things in the truck.  After they all left I just kind of hung out around here by myself, played piano.. kept myself occupied lol.

Later tonight I went bowling with Gina, Mandi, Noelani + her cousin, Sarah, Angela, Terry, Adam, Craig, and Kyle.  It was alright, but they played crummy music lol.  There were some scary Harpersville people down there! hehe .. yeah.. and a couple people coughAdamCraigcough didn't pay for their games and the rest of us had to chip in for them!  Anyway, enough for tonight I'm out"

Anyway, we just went for a nice walk in Hillcrest hehe.. searching for hott guys.. right.. no hott guys in Hillcrest ;-)

Open Gym was kind of slow, when we all got there coach wasn't there.  After awhile of waiting we finally called and found out she had completely forgotten about it. lol.. it was kind of funny.  Megan,Caitlyn,Erin,Marie, and a couple other freshman were there.. I think Heather and I managed to scare them a little more than they even were to begin with.  Hehe.. sorry girls we love you! :-) 

Heather and I left early to get ready to go to Touch of Texas.  It was a lot of fun hehe .. Gabe and I decided to make complete freaks of ourselves.. surprise right?!? :-) .. yeah.. so we were getting some pretty odddd looks.  It was hilarious though, ballet and dancing really fast and crazy to slow songs is a good time.. and it's OK to be different.. well.. at least that's what we tell ourselves :-) lol .. Next times we're dressing ghetto right girl? hehe .. 

Tomorrow is bowling!! Girls I'm just mad I don't have an angel shirt! waaaahh .. it's alright.. with my bandana and just my angelic personality I'll play my role just fine! hehe jj .. Good times though! I'm excited!"

Later I had my piano lesson.  My teacher wants me to play a Brahms piece at her church sometime soon.  I agreed to that, should be cool. 

After my lesson I made plans with Whitney and Kelly to go down to the church dance.  Whitney and I enjoyed watching Kelly dance (-: .. it was soo hot in there.  I hung out with Adam most of the time.. but occationally Whit and Kel would get me away for a dance or two. lol .. 

It's such a pain getting into livejournal now!  I know they're like waiting for new servers to come.. and i hope they come soon!"

"event","Well last night after open gym Allison, Kelly, Heather and myself went over to Chenango Gymnastics to check out this tumbling class.  I guess it's a pretty good class, and I suppose I was picking up on things fairly well.. but I still just don't have any faith that I'd really ever be able to do anything.  I don't know if I have lack of ambition or just no self confidence.  For whatever reason I'm not sure if I'm going to the next class tomorrow.. although I'm still not sure haha how sad..

After tumbling class I went home to find Hilary! :-) I haven't seen that girl in sooo long.  It was so awful this summer because we had all these things planned out, but it just happened to work out that the week she came into town I was checking right out for two weeks in Ithaca.  Then the very day that I was suppose to come home, she was leaving for a week of another camp.  Coming back here the day before yesterday left us only with yesterday and today because they're leaving for PA tomorrow early in the morning.  It's okay though, we still had fun last night and today.  Spent most of last night catching up on people and things.. and then today.. well it was too hot to do much more than lay around in the pool and in front of a fan hehe .. although Jenise came down and we went for a short walk.  Yeah.. Billie decided to wear a pair of new sneakers without socks so her heel started to bleed and we walked home.  Me without my shoes on lol.  Ohh.. so what do you call something that weighs a ton, is purple, and lives at the bottom of the ocean? .. why Moby Grape of course! :-)  The toe nails were flying.. umm in Hilary's eye.. jj .. strange story.

Later Allison, Gina, Hilary, Terry and I went to see A.I. .. well let's just say that was a interesting film.  At the end we just all kind of sat there like.. uhh we don't get it. lol .. the Robot went to dreamland? .. does that mean he fell asleep? .. he couldn't have fallen asleep cuz he wasn't REAL.. the blue fairy told him it wasn't possible to make him real.. so he couldn't have fallen asleep.. and he couldn't have died cuz he was a robot.. so how did he go to dreamland? .. i'm so confused hehe"

"event","Well, last night was not as horrible as I may have expected.  Adam's concert was nice, and I think I did alright with the questioning of the folk.  Always kind of on edge, hoping I say the right thing.. anyway..

After the concert I went up to Keely's.. I had a good time talking to Meg and Al until 5:30 lol Also driving everyone else crazy before that.  My parents came to pick me up at 10:30 and I went right home and called Adam.  Having a lot of family events today I wasn't able to see him.. wahh...it's alright though cuz i spent most of the day sleeping anyway.  

Later in the evening I went to this cooking party thing with my mom up at the Halls'.  It was alright, gave us something to do.. and there was some good food.. with strawberries and blueberries lol.  

When I came home I talked to Adam for a few minutes until his parents told him it was too late to talk on the phone.. being 10.  I guess they told him I can't see him this entire week because some relatives are up or something.  I'm sorry this is getting crazy, and it's so frusterating.  I guess the point his parents are making is that they don't want me around their son.. obvious enough right? .. i can't help it if he's who i want to be around..."

When I got home I anxiously awaited the arrival of the mail.  However, it was a waste of my time because I did not receive any.  Alright, so I miss someone a LITTLE .. I'll see him tomorroowwww..

Later I went out to bingo with my grandma.  We're so cursed, and well we suck at bingo.  lol.. seriously we barely ever even came close to winning. :-)  I'm out for tonight.. good night"

"event","Yeah.. as I sit here eating my tacos I am reminded of my burnt tongue.  I burned it earlier eating soup, but my genius friend Adam thought of a method where I would never burn my tongue again on soup.  Here it is to anyone who has ever dealt with a numb tongue due to hot soup.  Thank you for your support Adam! :-)

Three step method to making soup cooler
1. Get some soup on a spoon
2. blow (from your mouth) air onto the soup in the spoon
3. eat the soup/repeat

Happy soup eating.. and farewell to burnt tongues!"

Well, I spent most of today at the Soules' with Jenise and Rick.  We just played softball, basketball, cards, and listened to some music.  Giving ourselves something to do other than die from boredom. haha.. not really our lives aren't THAT sad.

Later on I just had a piano lesson where I spent most of the time talking to my teacher about camp, and then spent the last ten running through a piece I'm working on and checking out the things she's playing for her church soon.

After my lesson I went up to Gabe's house and Whit, Gabe, Amy, Meg, Kelly, Rebecca and me went down to the church dance.  Not a lot of people were there so we only stayed for about 45 minutes.  Then we walked down to Suzi Q's and hung out for awhile.  That's about my day right there.. I'm not up for sharing thoughts at the moment so i'm out for now"

"event","Alright, so I've been back a few days now, and I haven't written in here.  It's mostly because the thought of catching this thing up is a little overwhelming.  Two weeks of leaving civilization and basically living in a music hall where we practiced like 8 hours a day.  It was crazy lol.  Anyway, I'm not going to write a lot about camp in here mostly because I've talked about it to most of you already, and if you're curious just ask!

Since I've been back...
Saturday:  Well Saturday night when I got home after the final concert and everything I was able to hang out with Adam an hour or so.  It was sad cuz he was leaving the next day for camp.
Sunday: I spent most of Sunday sleeping, I was soo exausted.  Other than that I just went and got some material for my curtains and a few other errands.  Then I went to see Legally Blond w/Terry, I thought it was pretty cute.
Monday: Putting my room back together, right now it looks pretty bare.  Have no fear.. it's going to be BUrStinG with Billie soon enough! lol .. Later in the evening I went to open gym for cheerleading.. just getting ready for camp!!"

I'm so excited though and I hope there are lots of music freaks like me to become friends with! lol .. I'm going to miss everyone lots!!

Okay, so about my day today.. spent the afternoon at my grandma's house.. let's just say it was a LONG afternoon.

I got to hang out with Adam afterward though... :-) You are sooo sweet! I'm going to miss you!  

Well, this is the last entry until I come back.. but they're going to make us write in a journal everday at camp so i might transfer that once I get back.. byebye!!!!"

When I got home I practiced piano and oboe, and then Mattie, Abby, Megan, and their friend Tiffany came over.  I was talking to Megan for awhile, but then I realized that Mattie was getting angry at me for taking Megan's attention away from her so i left and checked mail and stuff.  A little later Mrs. Schieder (family friend).. came over and brought her grandchildren.. Zack (14) and Hannah (8).. so i hung out with Zack for awhile and he was talking about his friends and some other things, nice kid.. after they left my uncle Chris brought my little cousin Krysta over to swim.  So they finally got me in the pool.. isn't that a miracle??!?! lol i know .. it's been so warm lately the water wasn't that bad.. meaning pretty warm if i actually got in and stayed for awhile hehe.. now everyone has gone home! (-: peace

I was talking on the phone with Adam today, won't be able to see him though cuz his family is going down to PA to visit some relatives tonight.  O.. and for anyone curious.. i guess you could say it's ""official"" 

.. 1 more day until camp!
As for the rest of tonight.. I definitely need to finish packing because I don't want to deal with that tomorrow.. tomorrow is just the day to remember everything that i forgot to pack today lol.."

When I woke up around 11 I went downstairs to find that I was alone.  surprise surprise hehe .. everyone always leaves me ;-) Anyway I just did the usual stuff, practiced, and then I made a check list of everything I want to take to camp ahhhh I'm nervous but excited! hehe .. everyone is writing me right??!?!?! I'll cry if you don't, really i will! hehe

Then I talked to Adam on the phone and made plans to see a movie.. however there was a catch! yuck i hate catches.. his mom wouldn't let us go by ourselves (Billie's a bad kid ;-) so Mike (his friend) and Ali went with us.. I love Ali.. ur so awesome girl! (-:"

After they left I talked to AS on the phone while skimming my ever filled with leaves pool.  Okay, so he convinced me to go to the dance that was being held at my church, even though I knew no one would be there.  I was SOo surprised though! There actually were probably close to 40 people there.. it was worth going though because we got to talk and everything.  After the dance Kelly, John, Heather, Courtny, and me walked up to Heather's house where we hung out and watched.. well i guess we didn't really watch Unbreakable.. but it was playing!  John was harassing the fish.. and well the rest of us were eating and whatnot .. 

I definitely have a lot on my mind, unfortunately I suppose they are private thoughts.  I hope I can talk to AS tomorrow.."

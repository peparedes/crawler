"event","Where should I begin with all the shit that is annoying me?  I don't even know.  Well let's start with the good things and then you can draw your own conclusions as to the ones that suck.  Everything at home is good.  Lindsey, Phil and I are getting along pretty well.  We help each other and cover for each other...lol.  My Mom & Dad are being so awesome.  They are giving me my space, but still including me which is something that I really missed.  I even went apple picking in PA with my Dad, Lindsey, and Phil on Saturday (even though the weather sucked).  They really like Brandon and that really makes me happy cuz I want him to be included too and he is, he went to PA with us...lol.  If this is the person I think I'm gonna be with forever, I want my family to like him!  lol  And they do, so that's all good.  Work is good.  I got my raise at the beginning of the month...awesome.  But I am just getting tired of people.  If you have something to say to someone, say it to them.  I still feel like I need to accommodate everyone.  You don't care what I think, then why should I care what you think or what you say.  I'm tired of dealing with people especially the ones like Karen.  Bitch say whatever it is you want to say to my face.  I'm a big girl, I can take it.  But now everyone wants to say shit in a snide way cuz maybe they think I'm too dumb to realize stuff, but guess what?  I'm not... I know what you're getting at, and that shit is childish.  I'm trying to be accommodating, but this shit is getting old. I am just still getting used to everything.  I'm not staying out late on Work nights and my weekends are pretty subdued.  Now that I live with my family again, I need to devote some time to them as well as everyone else, and when it comes to plans, they come first.  It just sucks because at least once a week someone is pissed at me, and it is really starting to get on my nerves.  I just don't know what to do."

"event","It's so funny being a 21 year old female now, and my usual weekend activities consist of the movies, window shopping at the mall, snuggle time with the boyfriend, and reading a good book.  Most 21 year olds are out at clubs, at parties, getting drunk, and doing all sorts of stuff that if their parents knew about it, it would turn there hair gray.  But the funny thing is... I like how I spend my weekends, and I like how everything is going.  Brandon and I know we are a boring couple, and that is perfectly fine with us.  We are happy that way.  I like the fact that we can be in each other's company, but still be doing our own thing at the same time.  I think maturity has a lot to do with it, and I think for the most part I am pretty mature.  At least more mature than I used to be.  I don't drink nearly as much now that I am 21 as I did before I was 21.  I am happy with the way I am now, and I'm happy that everyone is happy with the way I am.  It's nice to not have to try and impress people.  When I go out, I don't need to be all dressed up and having to look my best.  I have a wonderful boyfriend, and whether I am in PJ pants and a t-shirt and no make up, or in a pretty dress with great (killing my feet) shoes and make up galour, he loves me either way.  And I love him for it!  I'm happy that my friends and I can just sit and talk and that be just as entertaining as going to a movie or to a club or whatever.  The most fun Gina and I have is when we are in the car listening to oldies and just being absolutely simple.  We make our own good times, and that is awesome.  I may have few friends, but the ones I do have are awesome.  We don't need to impress each other, or spend a ton of money to have a good time... put us in a car with cigarettes, combos (the pizza kind), soda, and an oldies CD (or something else completely ridiculous to listen to) and the first thing out of our mouths (usually Gina's) is ""Sweet"".  So in conclusion, being 21 is not what I had really thought it would be, I think it might actually be better!"

I am getting everything that had me worrying paid off, I might be getting a car (but it's not a definite... so keep your fingers crossed for me), I am doing very well at work, Gina and I are spending quality time together and having a blast, I get to snuggle with Brandon quite a bit and that makes me very happy cuz I love him, and I am going to be 21 in 1 WEEK!  Who's excited?  I AM!!!!!!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!!!!  I am actually just excited about the prior stuff.  Brandon is buying me clothes (so he is taking me shopping and who doesn't love that?), Gina and I are getting our nail and eyebrows done which makes me way giddy,  I might be getting a tattoo, and I get have dinner on my birthday with my Mom, Dad, Sister, Brother, Grandmother, 2 Aunts, 2 Uncles, Best Friend and Boyfriend... who could ask for anything better?  And oh yeah, that night, I'm going out DRINKING!!!!!!!!!!!! Hell yeah!  Well that's all for now... time for some snuggling!"

"event","Well let me start off by saying I am doing sooo well right now.  A lot of my worries have gone out the window.  I have called the apartment place I owe money to, and also the magazine comany, and I have set up paymet arrangements (that are not going to kill me) and I will have everything paid off soon, which is sooo exciting to me.  I was sooo worried and I was reallt stressing myself out about it.  But now, I can ring in my 21st Birthday on a cheerful and not so worried note!  And that you see, is AWESOME!  Brandon has been so wonderful and supportive about everything. I want to say thank you to him.  I also want to thank my best friend for putting up with me.  I promise after everything is taken care of, we are so having a girl's day... lunch, movie, and shopping!  And I'll even buy ya something for taking me to work all those mornings! lol  2 weeks and 1 day until I'm 21!  I can't wait!!!! I am so excited.  I get go out with my family and friends and then go drink myself silly with my best friend and my boyfriend... who could ask for a better birthday than that?  I don't think anyone could!  lol  Well that's all for now... I'll write more later...."

"event","Well I am back from my trip, and start work again tomorrow, so I will officially be off of vacation.  I had a great time with Brandon, he made my vacation wonderful cuz we got a lot of quality time, and with Gina, I had a blast just hanging out and being silly!  Now, it kind of sucks because I wish it would have been longer.  My vacation was more mental than anything, so I know that tomorrow, everything that worried me before vacation is gonna come back and hit me with double the force.  But, I will just have to work through it and try my best to get things resolved.  I want to try to have a good idea or plan of action in mind so that I can totally enjoy my birthday (2 weeks and 6 days!!!!).  That is my goal.  I want to start paying things off and work on getting a car.  That would make me way happy and relieve some of my stress and guilt.  I have no idea what I am getting from anyone.  All I want from Gina and Brandon is a card.  But Brandon is getting me something else (actually supposedly 3 things), so being a girl. I asked to play 20 questions to maybe get and idea of what to expect, but 10 questions in I gave up cuz I was totally confused, and Namtab would not help me... All I know or kind of know is that all 3 are shiney, I can wear all 3, 1 might smell good, and 2 might involve writing.  Unfortunately, Brandon said he could have been lying or trying to mislead me on purpose, so I have no clue.  So guess I  will just have to wait.  I feel bad because I want to get a tattoo, my first, with my best friend like 2 days before my birthday, but if I want to pay one thing off completely, I won't be able to.  I'm hoping I will get a little money for my birthday so that way I can afford to do something, especially go out and drink, vuz after I pay the one thing off which is $606.00, I won't have any money left to do anything until next pay with is the 15th of Sept.  It sucks.  I have all these plans and all these ideas about what to do and how to do things, but I just can't seem to put them in motion, that is what I need to work on.  I need to stop being selfish and just give upeverything so that in a year or so, I will be TOTALLY financially sound and good to go.  That is the best present I could possibly get.  It might even beat a car...lol, but only by a little.  I won't mind being poor and without now for a few months while everything gets taken care of and I know everything will be good afterwards.  I just still feel bad, cuz I've made all these plans for my birthday and I don't know if I'll be able to do any of it, and that sucks, but if I have to buckle down and give up stuff that will make me happy for a few days for something that will make me happy for a long time in the future, I will.  We'll just have to see what happens and how things go... And I hope they go well... Any words of encouragement?  If so, I need them!  Thanks... nighty night.... more to come."

"event","Let me start with a little history lesson... In November 2002, I started dating a guy.  I was newly 18, just out of high school, and I thought this guy was the best.  I thought he was as good as I was ever going to get.  So, thinking this, I gave him my love, I gave him money, I gave him support and an ear to listen.  I gave him gifts, I paid for most of our dinners out, or trips to the movies.  I gave him a shoulder to cry on when loved ones passed away.  I gave him a place to stay (because it was only fair since he co-signed for my apartment) when his house was too cold because he didn't heat.  And While he stayed with me, I paid the rent, I paid all the bills, and all he did was buy groceries once in a while.  When he had no car, I would drive him to work (30 miles from where I lived) at 4 o'clock in the morning.  And I never once got upset, because I though I was appreciated and I thought that I was loved, and whatever problems were going on, I thought they would pass with time...But I was WRONG!  After a few months, things were still going ok, but then the trust was broken on both parts, and instead of accepting the fact that we weren't together... I stupidly tried to win him back thinking that I really needed him.  But I shouldn't have bothered.  I should have just left well enough alone, but I thought I was in love and I thought he loved me too.  And do you know what I got in return?  I got suspiscion, accusations, and lies.  After our final break up (which was the last of many, and the one that I initiated), I found out how very stupid I was, and how shallow that love I thought I had really was.  I found out that he had talked to other girls while we were together, he had brought them to MY apartment, he didn't like my parents or the rest of my family, he was still hung up on his ex's, and he thought the worst things imaginable about me.  And now, I have no apartment and owe them $1800, and I owe miscellaneous payments that were not paid while he stayed there after I left.  And again, now, my credit is awful and I will end up paying it all myself... but that is ok.  I know that I was dumb and stupid and terribly naive, but I have learned my lesson.  I pity him, because he is missing out, but I feel sorry for myself because I'm not independent anymore.  I am depending on everyone else and I hate it.  I feel bad that my parents are suffering because of my stupid descisions, and my bad choices.  If I could take it all back, I would do it in a heart beat.  I would rather be alone for the rest of my life than to repeat the stupid choices I have made in the past."

<TR>
<TD>You're hot! You've read a lot. You've done a lot, and there's a lot you'd like to try in the future. You've got a sharp, sexy mind, and few inhibitions to restrain you from exploring all the pleasure you can get. You have few hang-ups, and there's not much you don't know about sex. You're open-minded and able to enjoy things that would make a lesser person squeamish. You're an exceptional treat as a lover, appreciated greatly by those who know the differnce. You were probably bored with a few of the people you've been with in your past, feeling like you had to drag them along with you in the sexual adventures you want to have, and probably dumping them for the same reason. It takes a lot to stimulate you; you realize it's not just about bumping uglies. In the end there's gotta be a lot more to it. Still, there is always room for improvement. Before you can graduate into a true sexual genius, there are a few things you've got to learn, to explore, to think through, talk through, and fuck through. A good place to start is in taking a look at the few things you're still a little hesitant to try. Break down you're last few barriers and discover the outer sexual frontiers, and you'll become a master. </TD></TR>

"event","For the past few days, there has really been nothing going on, and that really should make me happy cuz that means I haven't had anything to worry about, but I'm not happy though... it makes me think that the shit storm of the century is about to hit.  Seriously.  I just feel that since everything is ok right now, that something awful is about to happen.  I mean, my job is great.  Gina and I are hanging out more, and having so much fun.  Brandon and I are fantastic, I really couldn't be happier in that department.  I am actually spending quality time with my family tonight (we are going to see ""The Lion King"" on stage) and I went with the to a crab feast on Saturday, which is absolutely great.  I got to see Debra on Saturday night, and that was so good. I've missed her. And even though the Psychos have been back in towm for like 3 days, there hasn't been a sighting or an altercation.  So, thiss all really makes me wonder... what is about to happen?  I will be pissed especially with my vacation approaching (Aug. 6th- 14th).  I hope that I am just being paranoid about it, and nothing ends up happening.  I am bored as all get out.  I am at work and there is really nothing to do, so I might get off early which is awesome, but I really don't have to or want to.  I need that money on paycheck for my vacation...lol.  Now on to a more confusing topic of conversation.  Why can't people just mind their own business.  Why do the people in your life feel that they have a right to tell you what you should or shouldn't do?  And especially if you stop dealing with them, why do they still continue to think that they can try to control you and your actions.  You really just need to back off, and mind you own business.  I'm happy, and I think you need to stop worrying about what I am doing and worry about yourself.  And everyone knows who I am talking about (""The Bitch"" or as NAMTAB would say ""The Jitter-Cunt"").  I just wish she would worry about herself, instead, she fucking watches my every move... it's like ""Bitch, back the fuck up!""  Fucking get over it!  There's nothing you can do to change the situation, but there is something you can do to maybe stopping it from happening again...(hint, hint) Stop being a bitch to everyone, stop thinking you are always right and everyone else is always wrong, stop thinking you know best, and actually listen to others when they are speaking to you.  I think you'll be a lot better off.  But that is only my opinion, and I am just putting out there for the hell of it, cuz I know it's not like you'd actually listen to someone else.  The sad thing is, I don't even like you and I'm trying to help you.  I wonder if that makes me sad?  Well, I don't really care either way.  Well enough of my bitch-fest... it is notw time for me to go, and definitely have a cigarette cuz I just got myself all worked up... more to come."

"event","Well, right now work is going very very well.  I love my job.  I can't say that enough.  I have been spending more time with Gina, and I am loving it, cuz we have such a good time just hanging out and acting silly.  My boyfriend is still wonderful... he's the best.  But the one thing that has me stressing, is money, bills, and getting a car of my own.  I hate having to be taken everywhere by someone else.  I want to just be able to get up and go wherever I want to whenever I want to... you know?  I feel like I don't have any freedom, and it is really starting to suck.  I make good money, but I spend it on dumb shit, and I really need to stop.  Since I know I won't be getting any help from Asshole (a.k.a. Bruce) with the final apartment payment (which is +/- $1,800.00), I need to start saving money to make payments and get it out of the way.  I also need to payoff my credit card and my magazine bill.  I also need to pay my Daddy back for the $500.00 he let me borrow.  So all in all, when I get started paying... I'll be paying for a while, and I will always be broke, and will definitely not have money for a car.  But it's what I got to do.  So, I'll do it.  But be ready for some really cranky updates.  I just hate having to depend on everyone else and be such and inconvenience to them.  I just wish this were some really bad dream and I will wake up really soon, but I know it's not and that REALLY sucks ass!!!!  And now, I am done, but BEWARE... more to come."

I am positively the luckiest little lady in the world to have him in my life.  He is wonderful.  I hope that things continue to progress as smoothely and as wonderfully as they have this past month.  He is absolutely adorable.  He makes me laugh, and a lot of the times he doesn't really even mean to, I just think a lot of the things he says and does is funny, cuz he's just too cute.  All I can say right now, is ""YAY! 19 days til my 9 day vacation!""  That is so awesome!  Can't wait.  Now, don't get me wrong... I love my job.  I get pais great and I work for the 2 best bosses in the world, but sometimes you just need to get away.  You know?  Yes I have shit to worry about, but for those few days, I will not worry about anything.  I can pick my worrying back up after I go back to work.  You know?  Well I am going to finish enjoying my Brandon time... more tomorrow."

"event","Why does everything have to be so complicated?  I know I just said that I was happy and I wanted everyone else to be happy too, and I also said that I was gonna figure out some why to make everyone else happy...but you know what?  I just can't.  No matter what I do, someone is gonna be unhappy or even upset.  I'm not gonna sit here and put myself through the bullshit.  You know that famous little saying, ""Can't we all just get along?""  Well the answer to that is, NO!  NO, we can't.  No matter how hard you try to make everyone get along... you just can't.  And you know what?  I'll just have to deal with that.  I'm just hoping I won't have to be medicated to do it, because now that I have insurance, I'm not very eager to just go running out to the nearest pharmacy and get all the anti-depressants I can get my hands on...lol.  So, I don't know.  It just seriously sucks when you think everything is going so well, and you realize that it actually not.  I swear, when one good thing happens in my life, something else ends up going to the shitter.  It's inevitable.  I am just not meant to have everything go good all at once.  My life is seriously taking the ""upgrade"" , ""downgrade"" listings to an extreme.  It's like ""Yay, 2 steps forward""... and then when I'm least expecting it ""Damn, 10 steps back, NOW!!!!""  I just can't seem to find a happy medium.  I don't even want to have my cake and eat it too, I can just have it and look at it, or just take some icing off with my finger... that would be good enough... Well, I guess we will see what the future holds... just 21 days until my 9 day vacation... can't wait!"

"event","Ok, where do I begin?  Let me think for a minute... You know when you start a new relationship, it's new and everything is going sooo well and you are like so excited and happy to have someone in your life that makes you feel special that you just want to spend as much time with them as you can and for as long as you can?  That's how it is right now with me.  But what I am not thinking about is everyone else's feelings, and I feel bad about that.  I'm trying to be considerate of everyone... like I want to be respectful of the time that Brandon spends with his friends and he is being respectful of the time I spend with Gina (though I need to make a better effot to spend more time with her), and Brandon also met pretty much my whole immediate family today, and he was his usual charming self and won them all over, which makes me very happy since I know how they despised my ex.  I'm so thankful to him for making the effot and I'm happy it all came out great.  I am happy, and I am happy that I am happy, but now that I'm happy, I want everyone else to be happy too.  It's like they say ""misery loves company"", well that is the same for being happy.  You want everyone to feel the way you do.  I don't want anyone to be upset and I don't want anyone to feel left, whether it be friends or family.  But I know I can't have everything I want, but I am stubborn and some how I will figure out a way to make everyone happy and also continue to be happy myself.  The only question is... HOW?  How do I make everyone feel included and happy?  How do I divide my time equally and genuinely so that no one feels left out?  How do I keep everyone from getting mad at each other, especially when there is really no underlying contempt that everyone is seeing?  And while doing all that, how do I keep myslef happy?  I'm thinking the answer to that last question is Zoloft!  Because I know before everything is all said and done with and I and everyone else is happy, I am gonna be so depressed that I am going to need drugs!  And the depression isn't only going to be from the happiness question.  It is also from the bills, rent, not having a car, having to depend and inconvenience everyone else... and so on.  I can only keep my smile plastered on for so long before I crack.  You know.  And it is no one's fault.  It's just they way it is supposed to be right now, and since I am an optimistic person, I know it will get better, and hopefully soon.  But I am now sleepy and I am gonna try to get some sleep... More to come, so prepare yourself..."

He is going to miss you Steph... and good luck with your new job!  Tomorrow I am sleeping in (yay!) And then I am spending the evening with my best friend!  How awesome is that?  What can I say... I'm lucky like that.  I have a great best friend who always makes me laugh and I always have a good time with no matter what.  I also have the world's greatest boyfriend.  He is absolutely without a doubt the best.  There is just something about him that makes me want to spend every waking minute with him!  I just can't get enough of him.  It doesn't matter what we do as long as we are together... I could care less... if we are just sitting in his room watching Clerks (the cartoon episodes), or I'm reading while he plays the guitar, or we are sitting next to each other watching NAMTAB play video games, or we are all in Gina's car just driving around.... it's all good, cuz we are together.  I just love being around him.  He is the sweetest, most caring, loving, understanding person.  He's wonderful and amazing and I love him... well that's it for now...

"event","Now, if you are seeing someone, and all you want to do is spend almost every waking minute with this person, laugh with this person, talk to this person, cuddle with this person... you just feel so right with this person.  You feel like you couldn't be happy, well this happy, with anyone else, and in 2 weeks it has totally sky rocketed past any past relationship you've had... Could you call that love?  I do.  I may have only been with this person (technically) for a little over 2 weeks and we are already using the ""L"" word, but we've known each other for 2 years and have been close for like 6 months.  What I already know about him is the stuff you usually learn in the first 3 or 4 months of dating someone.  I feel so comfortable with him,, like nothing I do is going to surprise him, and nothing I say is going to shock him.  And I love that.  I said in the beginning that I didn't want to rush into anything too quick and become too serious, but after spending so much time with him and getting to know him in a new way, I can't help but fall for him.  He's pretty much everything that I've said that I wanted.  He's sweet, smart, caring, considerate, funny, fun to be with, gets along with everyone... we have a lot of the same opinions, we like a lot of the same things, and he is totally willing to compromise so that we will both end up happy.  How could you not love that?  How could you not want to fall in love with someone like that?  Am I crazy for rushing a little bit?  Maybe...  Could I get hurt or hurt him?  Maybe...(though I don't plan on it)  Could I be getting a little ahead of myself with the thoughts I am thinking and the feelings I am feeling?  Maybe... but I don't care.  I'm happy.  And right now, happiness is all I care about.  And as long as he's happy with me, I'm happy.  
Well, my best friend knows (and I'm happy she does even if she doesn't agree, she'll still back me up), and I thought maybe everyone else should know too.  I love someone.  And he is a wonderful someone.  And he loves me.  So, damn it, be happy for me!
I love you, Brandon.
That's all for now...more to come.

"event","Why isn't life just ever simple?  Why can't you just get what you want and be happy with it?  Why when you think everything is going so well, does it have to change, and then go shitty?  I have no idea. It just sucks.  Right now3 I am in the middle of an issue, but although I have to deal with it right now, my optimistic side tells me that everything will be ok, and probably in the near future, which makes me happy.  And although I am happy, there is just so much stress out there.  And let me tell you, I am not the only one stressing.  When you're little you think that being grown up is going to be so fun because you can do what you want when you wan with whoever you want, but no one lets  you in on the secret that there is so much stress to look forard to also.  I mean, you have to worry about finding and holding on to a job, you have to worry about money and about having enough to pay bills ( and let me tell you bills seriously suck ass), you have to worry about where to live and how to pay for that, you lose friends, and sometimes make new ones, you may grow apart from family, but sometimes, you also get closer.  Then there's the relationship stress...You meet someone, think they are great...then you find out they are a complete ass.  And then you have to deal with all the drama that goes along with that.  But then you are lucky enough to find someone who makes you amazingly happy.  Why can't you just be happy all the time?  I guess that is there wasn't something out there to make you unhappy then being happy wouldn't be special.  You can't have good without having bad because without the bad then you would know how good it is to be happy.  So, bad and good go hand in hand, but I can deal with that as long as I have more good times than bad times."

"event","I was upstairs laying in bed contemplating on whether or not to go to sleep or finish watching the weird foreign movie that I had started while painting my toenails, when I started to think.  So, I decided to come downstairs, get on the computer, and give you some of my thoughts.  It is amazing to me how quickly people change.  It's like as soon as you think you know someone or what they are going to do, they change on ya and you're left guessing.  I so do not like that, but I'm probably guilty of that myself.  You think you are happy and you think you are settled, and then something happens, and you realize you're not.  And if that happens time and time again, how do you ever know when you're really happy and really settles...cuz you can think you are, but then it turns out you're really not and the cycle just repeats itself.  It's totally confusing.  But I've also realized that there are signs.  Yes, I thought I was happy before, things were going good and I thought that I was settling in to the life I thought I was meant to have, but little doubts and little issues kept popping up.  I should have realized it then, but I was young and naive, but I thought eventually it would get better, but I was wrong.  And you would think ""Wow, that sucks for you!"", but even though I thought the same thing for a while, I realized that it was actually a good thing.  I made some horrible judgements and some dumb, dumb decisions, but I also learned from those decisions and I accepted the consequences of the choices I made, and although everything isn't perfect, it is getting a lot better.  I am happy in a few aspects of my life and that's good enough for me.  I have a great person in my life, who is sweet and caring and considerate and who makes me feel special, even when I know I don't deserve it.  I know who my real friends are... you know they one's who stand by you no matter what and are definitely on your side.  I have also added a ture friend to my list who al though I wasn't close with him before, I am now and that wonderful.  I absolutely love my family.  I enjoy spending time with them and listening to what is going on since I'm not there to experience it first hand.  And now I know that no matter what I need and no matter what dumb decisions I've made, and no matter how bad the mistake, that my mom and dad are there for me 150%.  That is an awesome realization.  I have a great job now, and although someone (Bitch) got me the interview... I got the job myself, thank you!  So, although I had taken like 8 steps back, I'm definitely taking a couple steps forward now, and I couldn't be happier.  Well I think that enough rambling for the night...until next time..."

"event","Well let me start off by saying that I am WAY confused, and although that is not an unusual occurance, it is way worse right now.  The past few weeks a lot of stuff has been going on...  
1) Brandon and Ashley break up (and just so we are clear... I had nothing to do with that.)
2) Brandon and I start hanging out and talking and we realize that we are pretty much perfect for each other
3) Ashley, being the psycho that she is, decides to try and manipulate people and then gets mad when it back fires in her face.
NOw people. please tell me, what is wrong with what is going on here?  I would really like to know because I am smack-dab right in the middle and I still have no clue.  Do you really think that by acting all kinds of crazy and lying is really going to want to make someone come back to you, or even make new people want to get to know you?  I think not.  The only two things I'm not confused about 1) that i have the best best friend in the world.  She is caring and understanding and i wouldn't trade her in for anything.  2) That I now have the world's best boyfriend!  I know I don't deserve him, but it's too late, he's stuck with me!  He is the sweetest, funniest, smartest person and I am sooooo happy to be with him.  He understands me and he is definitely considerate of my feelings and I love that.  I couldn't have asked for anyone better and I know it's just going to get even better as time goes along.  That's all for now because I am at work... but be prepared for more later..."

"event","Well, let me start with my really big news...if you've already read his latest entry, then you already know, but I want to tell you all too... Brandon and I are officially a couple.  I am very very excited about it and I am very very happy, too.  But, he and I have talked, and we are not going to make the same mistakes we've made in the past.  We don't want this to be like a our past relationships, and I couldn't be happier about it because obviously, they didn't work out.  But anyways...Gina, I love you and even though Brandon and I are going out, you are still my best friends, my ""girlfriend"", and my sister...Please trust me when I tell you that that will never change.  And no matter what is going on, I am here for you if you need me, even if it's just to talk, or listen to you vent.  Brandon and I were talking last night, and we realized that we are are so much a like, it's ridiculous.  Not only were our prior situations extremely alike, but it is sooo much more.  We view things that same way.  And in a lot of circumstances, we feel the same way and come to the same conclusions.  Plus, we both don't like tomatoes!  Now I'm not saying let's go pick out china patterns or anything like that... I just find adorable, and majorly amusing.  Well I need to go take my puppy for a walk...later"

No parents, no rules, and lots of drinks...Amy is going to have a good night.  And her goal is to get her best friend, Gina, and Mike, F-U-C-K-E-D UP!!!!!  lol  That is a great goal.  On an all together different note....I am very happy to say that I have found someone who makes me very happy.  And no, sadly it is not NAMTAB.  Sorry.  Though he is an adonis among men, any girl would be lucky to be with him, I have fallen for another...lol  He is sweet, funny, fun to be with, smart, caring...and all the other hundreds of things that I want in a guy.  So far, he's perfect.  How can you top that?  I don't think that I can.  Well I have to go and start to put my plan into action...let the Fucking up begin...later"

"event","Well, it is late...and I should be in bed, but surprise, surprise... I'm awake...and bored.  I'm attempting watch The Real World 7 casting special on MTV, but the cast is not that interesting and no one is hot.  Now last season...can you say LANDON!  He was HOTT!!!  Yes, he deserves two T's.  God, I am sooo bored, but it's not like there's anything to do anyway...lol.  I cannot wait until 5 o'clock on Friday...So off for the weekend.  I really want to go to the beach.  I am a beach bunny.  Of course I'll go, I'll burn and end up looking like a lobster fresh out of the pot, but that's cool...after a day or two, it'll tan.  YAY!
Anyways...on to a new topic.  How about Cheaters... that just popped into my head and I think I'll rant about that for a while...Why do people chest?  I mean what is the point?  If you think that you would be happier with someone else, why lie and cheat?  Why not just tell the person you are with that you think it would be best that you date other people?  Is it really that hard.  I mean I understand that they don't do that because they want their cake and want to eat it too, but if you lie and you get caught, your original relationship is done anyway.  So why not just tell the truth and maybe you can spare everyone the drama and the pain, and maybe in the end, the awful break up that is inevitable... I mean why can't you just be happy with what you have?  Obviously there was something there or you wouldn't have started dating them in the beginning... doesn't anyone realize that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.  You can't always get what you want, and sometimes when you get what you want, you realize that you were so consumed with getting and now that you have it, you really don't want it.  And that...it really sucks ass.  I want love!  I want everything that comes along with it too, that being trust, honesty, faithfulness, commitment, friendship... Don't guys want that too?  I know I'm not the only one here.  I know there's someone out there for me.  Someone who will truly make me happy and be there for me no matter what... someone who will trust me and confide in me... someone I can make happy and care for... I know he's out there and I might have already found him.  I'm just scared.  There are so many asses out there...how do you know that you have a good one?  I guess only time will tell, but I have faith in him and in me.  So I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens... Don't worry I'll let you know! Nighty night"

"event","I am now sitting at work, and don't get me wrong, I love my job.  I have two of the best bosses in the world, but I just do not feel like being here.  It's a beautiful day outside so far, and I just wish I could be out there enjoying it.  But I know where I belong...and that is here making money.  I was sitting here and I'm not really doing anything of importance right now, so of course my mind started wondering, which I tend to do A LOT of.  But what got me thinking was a text message from my best friend.  She said that the creepy guy doing construction across the street was staring at her, so then that got me thinking.  Why do people stare.  I mean what is it about you or me that is so out of the ordinary from everyone else that people must stare.  I mean I don't think I look so out of the ordinary that it would cause people to stare.  I don't have a 12"" mohawk, or wear face paint, or even distracting clothing.  Actually,when it comes down to it, I think I am quite plain in comparison to other people.  But no matter where I do go or what I'm going it seems like I end up attracting someone's attention, and it's not even good attention, they just look at me with one of two looks, one: the look someone gives you when you are acting totally stupid and they think you are out of you mind, or two: the look where you don't really know what they are thinking about you and that just makes you extremely uncomfortable.  And there is a big difference from the way a girl looks at another girl and the way a guy looks at a girl.  As a girl, when I am at the mall or just out and about, if I look at another girl, I am either assessing what she's wearing to think if I like and if I would buy it (like her shoes...I'll think are they cute, would they look cute on my feet, or something to that affect) or I'm thinking that she just looks like a skank or that she is just being annoying as hell.  Now when a guy looks at a girl, he takes it all in at once, her shape, size, whether she is attractive or not, and probably if she is attractive...what she would look like naked.  I mean and if you're not like completely obvious, who cares.  But I'm 20, if you are 35 or older, that's gross.  I don't want old, scary, ugly men looking at me, especially if I can tell they are looking at me.  That's just awful.  So, if you are a scary old man and you are reading this, STOP what you are doing and leave it to the young, hot, single guys to look at us.  Thanks
.....More to come...."

"event","It is SOOOO Hot outside, it's ridiculous.  But besides that, there has been a lot of stuff going on recently.  Where shall I begin?  Let start with the Bitch (a.k.a. Ashley).  I don't know what is going on in that psycho head of hers.  First she tells me how bad of a friend I am, and how I don't spend enough time with her and our ""group"" and then when I do, she wishes I would go away.  What is that?  Well, now that I'm cut off (Thank you God) as she so wonderfully stated in the retarded letter she felt the need to have me read, I don't need to worry about her hypocritical attitude anymore.  The sad thing is, that I'm not upset about it.  And if any of you know me, you would know that that isn't at all normal for me.  I thought I would be upset, you know losing all of those people who you thought were you friends would do that to you, but I'm ok.  I'm more than ok.  I've realized that I have one great and wonderful best friend, who no matter what I did (no matter how stupid) would still be there for me and all I would have to do is ask.  That is great.  And then there is this other person. It is someone who I have thought of as a friend for a long time, but now, it's more.  And although I am scared of what might or might not be,  I still want to take the chance.  That is a big step for me becuase I am not usually a ""take charge, step up to the bat"" kind of girl.  After my last relationship (with the Asshole from Hell), I didn't really think I would find anyone who could make me so happy again, I thought I was either stuck with the Asshole, or I would be alone.  But now, I'm not so sure.  I see something there, and I am so amazed and humbled by it.  I hope he feels the same way, but only time will tell... but have no fear, I'll keep you posted!"

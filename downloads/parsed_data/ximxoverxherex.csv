"event","Well my life is rather good, but I cant help but feel bad about what i told Drew... He seems to care so much for me but I cant be with him... We all know why... For one... Trust is a key issue in a relationship, not to mention Ryan... He has been so good to me since we have gotten back together and I couldnt see myself without him right now... He means so much to me, probably more than he will ever know... But maybe in the future he will find out... Who knows... All I know is I broke a heart and broke mine as well... I had high hopes but things didnt go as planned... Not to mention I broke Ryans heart when I broke up with him, then made him happy when he asked me to go back with him and said yes... So far so good... Just hoping things dont go bad like they did before...I honestly do hope that Drew isnt too hurt that he cant be my friend... I know I am killing him... Heres the email he sent me : Hey Britt,
              I don't know about you but I have beeen thinking an awful lot about us and all.  I don't want what i am about to write to affect your decision or anything else i jus want to let you know how i feel about everything is all.  I love you with my whole heart and soul britt and i truly do mean that and I have meant that everytime i have said it.  Every night since that night you left back home i have prayed that maybe God would give me just ""one more day"" with you.  Although I know that if he did end up giving me one more day then i would not want that day to end at all.  I can't stand to spend the rest of my life without you britt.  I would go to the ends of the world in fact the ends of the universe for you.  I would do anything you wanted me to.  Even if that something was to leave you alone forever, althought i would not like that so much, i would do that just for you.  Words will never be able to do justice to the feelings that i have for you britt.  I wish that there was some way that I could show you this.  Well, I have not ever cried over a girl as much as i have you.  And in case you are wondering why i say that i will never have another girl while i am in the military it is because i do not think that any woman in this world could make me happy except you.  I feel like you are the one for me britt.  this is not just one of those feelings like ""oh i feel like i need to do this or something""  it is alot stronger than that britt.  well i gotta go for now i will try to call you later.
 
Andrew


I feel really bad because I had to send him a email back to let him know that we cant be together... Maybe in a different life... We are just too different... Until next time..."

You know how much we love you
And care for you so deeply
But now you are in heaven
Roaming oh so freely
I cannot seem to fatom
That this is actually real
I know there are many people 
That feel the way I feel
I miss you so much, Sarah
I know you're in a better place
But I cant help but miss
Your beautiful smiling face
You were my best friend growing up
We used to have so much fun
Now all I'm left with is memories
Cuz my cousin and friend is gone
I know I shouldnt cry
You are in heaven with others we love
And I know in my heart, Sarah
You are watching us from above
The reality of this whole thing
Hasn't quite struck me
How did this happen to you
How could this possibly be
I know I'll see you again, Sarah
Right now it's just so hard to bear
So I'll say goodbye for now
Your in heaven, I'll see you there"

<i>So, who am I?</i>

I am a Melbourne born and raised, Australian singer/songwriter/actor/professional procrastination/occasional muse who was classically trained in Piano and Violin (Suzuki Method) and has more than 10 years service of the Australian Childrens Choir, Australian Girls Choir and as a soloist. 

An extensive service and ensemble experience (including as Concertmaster) with the likes of Melbourne Youth Music, State Music Camp, Channel 9's Carrols by Candlelight, school ensembles both official groups and student run, and more including national events, tours and ensembles.

My first self-written piece was at the age of 13 on piano in the music center at school. I then slowly brought in string arrangements and I'm still learning each and every day I play music. And I will forever be an addict to the music.

Currently, I work as a soloist producing music independently with the help of friends, while working off a laptop and a headset microphone (often found precariously perched on top of my piano).

If there is a piano in sight, expect me to make a B-line right there :)

Enjoy and much love,

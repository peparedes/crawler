"event","So this past Friday my boyfriend Eric (my Heart! my love- but we will talk about him later) was playing a show at the Mill Hill in Trenton. . . 

Earlier that day on my lunch break from work I had lunch with my dad and Eric and Eric mentioned to him that he was playing a show there and my dad was like "" Oh i've played there a bunch of times! Maybe i'll stop by!"" and Eric was like ""yeah yeah yeah!"" and I didn't think anything of it because A) I didn't actually expect him to show up and B) I wasn't even really planning on going. . . 

So anyway, 
I end up going and bringing my friend Kim and her boyfriend Sebastian who were drunk as hell by the time we got there because they drank some Everclear or something. And I was just watching Eric play and it was cool and he was really good and out of freakin NOWHERE my dad appears right in front of me! And it was between songs at this point so it wasn't loud and he goes "" You're not 21 what're you doin' in a bar! I'm her dad I came to check up on her! Eriiiiiic! Woooooo!"". . . . . Aaaaahahahaha! I didn't know what to do! I didn't think it was possible for my dad to embarrass me anymore because we're both so weird and now that I've grown up I'm comfortable being weird with my dad in public but at the time this was just toooo much for me. Anyway my dad goes upstairs and drinks with the oldies and comes back down for the last song. When they were done me and Eric go outside to smoke a cigarette and when we go back in his ENTIRE band is circled around my dad. Hahaahah. I was like ""what is going on!""

Haha, but anyway they loved him. 
I can laugh about it now."

It seems i'm drawn to scumbags, i have this theory that i'll be able to change them with my super psychological female powers but i have come to learn that it's just not possible. And i figured that out now...even though everyone's been telling me for years.

And to top it off, the people that are freakin perfect for me i'm not into. For example i have a friend who recently told me he digs me but i've known him for 6 years and although he's always been there for me and is like the nicest guy i know i'm just not feelin it! but WHY. I push away the people that matter. There are a few people from my past that i really wish i had given a chance.

I wish i could go back in time. And be smart.

But for now i'm just gonnna chill, not think about it, and let the bitches come to me."

It wasn't just any club it was a gay spanish club, haha, and at first i was like uuuuuh WAAAY out of my comfort zone but dude....mad fun, mad drag queens, GAY FIGHTS....and let me tell you...i've never popped my booty so much in one night. Or like...ever, before that. 

And in other news i have no man. Because he's a motherfucker (should've known). I sensed this when things first started bubbling but instead of being smart like i never am i said FUCK IT. Buuuuuut it went bad and once again i'm left here looking like the moron.. i guess it's a good thing i realize how much better i am than him because i COULD get real upset. But i won't. Because i don't have the energy to waste time on people who don't give a fuck about me. It's pointless.

"event","So i have this new ""i don't give a fuck attitude"" which is working out really well for me. OH yeah? you don't like me? Well hey I DON'T GIVE A FUCK...what? my boyfriend hasn't called me in 3 days? OH THAT'S RIGHT...ALMOST FORGOT...I DON'T GIVE A FUCK. Yeah it's nice to not expect anthing, so i'm never dissapointed. I have a new man, whom i'm skeptical of because i'm pretty sure it's hard for him to care for others. But don't worry, it's not another Chris, NOTHING like another Chris. But expecting nothing is awesome! It's like...nothing mentally is changing for me just who i'm hanging out with. 

Dude! Mad shit is happeneing in my life. I wish Livejournal weren't so gay so i could write it all on here but i have spy's everywhere for REAL. I feel like i'm on a show. Like the Truman Show but it's the Jamie show. I feel like no ones real. I feel like everyone's acting. I don't like that people i don't know know things about me. But hey....i guess i don't really give a fuck.

But don't we all? Just a little? Don't we all want to be liked?
No. Fuck that. I played the everyone-like-me-card all throughout highschool and i'm sick of it. I gots a new job, a new man, and a new outlook on things. No longer will i be a pushover, or will i cry over some shitty man. The ball will ALWAYS be in my court with the way i see things.

OH! and another thing! I realized that i am a CATCH, okay! Like as far as being a girlfriend goes i'm MAD leniant not to mention all of the other cool shit about me like how i make the best gaucamole and do sweet impressions. So another reason i'm not stressin over no MAN is because those motherfuckers are lucky to have me. And i finally realize that.

But i feel like i'm wrestling with myself i feel like i have an angel and a devil on either shoulder. Don't be fooled by what seems like confidence in what i write....it's purely insecurity.

Maybe i'm writing all of this because i need to talk. Maybe it's because i'm drunk...i don't know. I miss the good ol days. I miss everyone. I miss corey and jimmy and abbey and brendan and i even miss danielle. What happened to when things were simple? When our parents gave us money? When our education weren't so important? 

I don't want to be a dog trainer anymore.
I just want to sleep forever. Live in my dreams. Which have been fucking ridiculous lately, i might add.

I'm apprehensive.
I'm nostalgic.

"event","So i guess a lot has been happening lately..
I gave my 2 weeks notice at Petco and i start at Roma Bank soon. They're paying me more, and i won't smell like ferret poop when i leave there everyday + bank hours...sweet beans.
The guy that ""stood me up"" is really not an asshole..at least not to me and i've been chilling with him, and i dig him. But i'm not going to get too excited about THAT because i know how i get with boys. I get all excited then some shit happens that fucks it all up. So i'm going to need to talk about this one as little as possible.
Despite what good may be in my life, it always come with the bad which-this time- is internal. 2 Tuesday's ago i was suddenly unable to eat at much as i use to. I'm full very quickly if i can even hold down food at all. This happened to me 2 years ago but i didn't go to the doctor for it because i thought my metabolism was just changing but this time it's so much worse i'm always dry heaving because my stomach is trying to throw up but there's never anything in my stomach. And i'm ALWAYS hungry but can't do anything about it. And it constantly feels like i've done 1000 crunches. Anyways i went to the doctors and they said it's either Gastritous, Ulcers, or Pancreaitis. And she said if there starts to be severe discomfort in my abdomonal area that i have to go to the emergancy room. UGH. It's just sucks because i'm finally coming out of my funk, and this shit has to happen. Now i have to do all these tests and bloodwork.. So i've been taking it easy lately if any of you are wondering where i've been."

Every time i pass the sev i look for his car because he was always there rolling. I remember he came to seaside after prom and he tried so hard to win me a stuffed animal. He always use to tell melanie i broke his heart. He smoked me out right before my frist day of college and i was stoned and terrified. He told me i was the only one besides him and doc that he ever let drive his car. I went to his house on tuesday with kim and we left notes and flowers. I guess i'm just really sad.

I feel like i have so much YET SO LITTLE going on in my life right now. Ummm, the birthday was good, got another tattoo, i'm working like a dog.

I have been such a hermit crab lately. For the past like...2 months i have had no social motivation or desire to see, get back to or make any sort of effort with people lately. I don't know if it's because of the whole Chris thing or if it's because of the Melanie thing but.. now i have cabin fever and i need to get out.

There's this girl that just started at my job..ugh. She wears me out..she reminds me of a happier me at that age..even though she's only 2 years younger than me, but still i've grown a lot since then. She's all like ""UUUUUUGH i don't want to be here when i'm done my shift i'm getting out of here as soon as possible i'm going to a party. ANNNNND it's my 1 month with my boyfriend!""

Nothing major to report in my life except that it's fucking WEIRD dude, once again.
I feel like every 6 months everything changes.

I'm living the single life which i thought would be sweet but it's really not different then the relationship life except the fact that i don't have that.
I've been stringing Chris along for months now and he keeps thinking we're going to get back together but i always tell him to move on. The truth is i don't want to be with him but i don't want him out of my life. If i tell him i don't see anything bewtween us i will never see him again. And that's a fact.

I've lost friends AGAIN, for no reason AGAIN...i guess people just get sick of me. But you think you find people that you're going to be friends with for ""the rest of your life"" but it's all just a bunch of mother fucking temporary fucking bullshit. Fuck Fuck Fuck.

2008 so far and maybe 2 months prior to '08 has been a lot of random people from my past popping back into my life to tell me how happy they are. I think this is a weird kind of karma that it fucking with me mentally. Everyone i've ever hurt, anyone that has ever held onto me, has let me go. And this is and odd feeling.

Everyone must think i am such a bitch. Breaking up with him 2 days after Christmas....telling him i don't want to talk to/see him anymore on VDay. I swear it's just a coincidence, i don't plan it this way. So i spent my night wallowing in my own self pity and eating my feelings....i'll take it.

On the other hand me and my dad have been getting closer and he finally admitted that i am his favorite. AND my mom finally admitted that George is her favorite.

This relationship is making me feel clostriphobic. I feel like i'm in a cage. I feel like i can't escape the ""i love you's"" and his plans for our future. To be quite honest i don't see a future with him. And having just learned this recently, it's hard to end something with someone who thinks everything's perfect. I've made it very clear that i have been unhappy not just in the relationship but in general (it's been a shitty month)and he tries so hard to be the best boyfriend and any other girl would appreciate what he does but i don't at all. I'm sick of it. Although i may sound completely selfish, it's time for me to stop trying to make everyone else happy before myself- even if it means hurting other people.

And also...i didn't think i'd get this ""middle child syndrom"" that therepists and other head doctors talk about but I GOT IT, AND I GOT IT BAD....My sister's living in West Villiage in NYC making 80g's a year and my brother fucking beat boxes, break dances, plays the harmonica, drums....jesus christ. I'm sure my parents have already voted me Most Likely to Develop an Addiction (runs in the family)

I've just been really confused and upset and indecisive and bitter lately...i don't know if it's because people close to me are dropping like flies, it's the weather, or maybe i just have bad anxiety.

I am once again getting to the point in his and my relationship where i'm starting to resent him because i want to hang out with my friends and i feel trapped and settled down and overwhlemed with such a commitment i got myself into. I don't know. I feel this way like once every 3 months and it sucks.

School's pretty good. I like the people i hang out with.

So i have to get my wisdom teeth pulled!! Ahhhhhhh, i'm nervous because they're impacted which means they're going to have to like..unhinge my jaw to get them out (apparently). But yeah Novem"

"event","In the past year and a half with my experiences in a lot of things, the most baffling to me is the fakeness i see in people's relationships.

There are two dudes i can think of off the top of my head who act(ed) so undeniably dedicated to their girlfriends, but then as soon as they're not around they fuck someone else, or try to. It worries me. Even though i know that Chris would never cheat on me (mostly because he would never have a chance to) it makes me nervous to know that there are guys out there that fake love, and do it really well. 

I don't know. I feel like Carrie from Sex and the City.

And is it just me or in the past couple of months have girls just gotten sluttier and sluttier? What is it going to be like if we have kids? Our kids are going to be fucking at like...12 years old.

My entire generation scares me.

Do you realize how ugly we're going to be by the time we're old? With cigarettes and tanning salons and energy drinks and hair extensions and drugs and all of our tattoos. Our skin will be saggy and wrinkled, our tattoos will be stretched and faded....Everyone will be bald.

And because i probobly didn't say goodbye to people that have already left for college: Goodbye and goodluck...may your summer have prepped you for the comas you will be drinking yourselves into all year."

Summer's coming to an end and even though people think i spend my time with (only) my boyfriend smoking ourselves into comas it wasn't like that at all...i had a lot of fun. I went to parties and i met new people and i got fucked up --  just with different people. And i'm cool with that.

There are some things people just don't understand. It's never going to be the same as last summer. Everyone's lives are completely different. Whether you've been away at college or are going at the end of the summer. People get mad because everyone's chagning. Well what do you expect? We're an entire year older and for a lot of us, this is our last year as a teenager. I use to be pissed that people were changing too and i'd deny that i was but i am, and i've accepted that. I like my life right now.

In other news...and one thing i MOST DEFFENITLY DO NOT LIKE is my fucking job. Fuck my mother fucking lame ass job that has me doing everything for fucking 8.50 an hour. And fuck my bitch boss that comes in with her fucking marital problems as i'm about to leave for the day only to fucking SCREAM at me liek i havn't been busting my ass. And it's not like i do it for me, or for money everything is for my fucking general manager. Even if i make everything look PERFECT it's her that gets the pat on the back, the raise, the recognition. Just......fuck petco. Fuck it in the ass.

We're both stubborn, neither of us are ever wrong, and when there's a problem we ignore it...because then it just goes away. Or so we think. She's a cool lady but i never thought she was mother material. I realized that i was turning into her when i started to question my current relationship with my boyfriend. No matter who or what i have i'm always looking for something better. Even when i have the best. And before you realize you have something good you put all your eggs in one basket, fucking yourself for if/when this relationship ends.

I don't know where i'm going with this. It always sounds a lot better in my head.

I got my car fixed, it was pretty fucked up. I rearended someone AGAAAAAAIN can you believe it? It was only like half my fault anyway....why would you stop at a yeild sign especially when there's no traffic coming? But the good part is that i did it to a SHITTY car and i didn't put not one scratch on it, whereas 2 years ago when i rearended someone it was a BRAND NEW car and i basically took off their whole back bumper. So maybe in another 2 years i'll only lightly tap another car.....but still fuck up my hood.

Yes, you still have your youth but you think of certain things different than when you weren't an adult, or even when you were 17.

But anyway there were like 300 people (including ms. Jen Nester) which is nothing compared to what we thought it would be. And also every time i went outside to smoke a cigarette which was like 4780534975 times, i got looked up and down so much. Like....i'm not even trying out and these mediocre, never gonna make it, bitches are just judging me. Anyway it was cool because i was cuter than them....just kidding....but seriously.

My dreams never make any sense.

In other news and SPEAKING of my birthday i'm going to see Bullet For my Valentine and All That Remains on it, i only half listen to either of those bands but it's something to do i guess. And if you want to come let me know.

I took these online self assesment things to figure out what i want to be when i grow up and all three said i should go into marketing specifically to be a technical sales representative. So i'm thinking i'll major in Marketing and minor in Communications. Awesome.

A sexy nurse or a sexy police woman....well let me tell you....I'm being the same thing i was last year ANNNND i'm going trick or treating. So there.

So i conformed and got one of those Facebook things. I don't really like it.

Sooo the other night while i was sleeping my tongue ring fell out and the next morning i couldn't get it back in! So now it's been like 2 days and it's completely healed and i'm fucked...basically. There goes 90 bucks.

My goal&nbsp;is to be moved out by spring and know what i want to be when i grow up by next fall. Eh? Eh?

Alright this whole day light savings time thing's making me all tired because to me it's still like...quarter to 1. And i'm tired.&nbsp;
Goodnight."

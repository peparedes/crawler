"event","Well I went to go see Mike yesterday night and it was wierd. It's not like it is in the movies you talk to him on a phone but you see him through a camera and it just sucks. It made me miss him more, not just miss him but really miss the things he does and the ways he makes me laugh. I really miss the way when i'd sit next to him he'd play with my ears, he has an ear fetish, and I don't know I just really miss that. Then he was cracking jokes and shit and making me laugh and to tell you the truth I didn't even want to smile because I miss him so much. But everytime he smiled i couldn't help but smile. 
Then Cassi and I were going to go see When a Stranger Calls and then we were sitting in the movie and Cassi called David to see if him and roommate wanted to come see the movie and they said no that they were going to get some shit and we they asked if we wanted to hang out. So David came and got us and we went and chilled at his house. Nothing happened. So i went home and got ready for bed and then i went to bed at 10-10:30.

And now I'm updating this lj that no one reads or comments to. Oh well. I'm out. I'm going to go take a nap. I got up at 9:30am. And thats too early for me to be up.





I Love Michael Gonzalez"

"event","<P>Well Mike is in jail... until the 27 at the earliest. And this sucks so bad... cuz if his mom doesnt pay for him to call me so i can give messages to her then he cant call any more. But I am going to go see him on Saturday. I wanted to go tomorrow but you can only visit on certain days and the days to go visit him are Monday, Thursday and Saturday. I was going to make an appointment for Thursday but the only times they had open were in the morning and I have school! And this really sucks I missed his call today cuz I was getting my Identification card so I can go see him. And now I can but not till Saturday. But I wrote him a letter and sent it today! So hopefully he gets it soon and writes back. Yeah.<BR>I didnt go to school today because i was waiting for his call cuz I told him to try calling at 12 cuz I wasnt sure if I was going to go to school cuz I had cramps last night. And Im kind of avoiding school cuz I break out in hives when I do go to school and it sucks. My mom had to come get me early from school Friday cuz I was itching really bad. And Saturday night Sunday early morning I was at Mikes and then shit happened the cops came and got him or his VOP(violation of probation.) And I was soooo scared and yeah it was badddddd. But its ok.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And tomorrow I HAVE to go to school and probably break out in hives and its gonna suck. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Oh and so everyone knows I might be moving in July. Im going to my dads in July to visti but if the rest of the school year doesnt go good and me and my mom are still fighting then im leaving and im going to just try living there for a year and see how it goes... And the only way I will stay is if Cassi doesnt move this summer or if me and Mike are still together.</P>

"event","today i went to Mikes court dates. The case got thrown out. So i went with him and his mom to sears and to the car place. Then i came home and waited to hang out with him again. Went to the mall with Cassi and i got him a gift and Nicole and Cassi and my cousins a gift. Then i fell asleep on the bus and Cassi woke me up because Mike was in the car next to us but he didnt see us. And he called Cassi and told her that he was going to call me when he got home but he never did and ive been waiting the whole night and there is nothing to do. I LOVE HIM SOOO MUCH. Im not mad at him i worried because he was with this other Mike guy and hes not a good kinda guy. And i hope nothing happened to him. Ummmmm so Nicole might be living with me soon. YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And were going to go now because we have to find something to do. Remember people SKEET SKEET.

"event","me and sherrie got into it again today cuz she doesnt know when to shut up, i was having a wonderful day before she came to my house and started yelling at me. but w/e i got to say some stuff to her. and ten amanda imed me and told me that her mom said she thinks i was stoned and thats why i was acting like that.
I THINK THAT I JUST HAVE A LOW BULLSHIT TOLERANCE LEVEL. and maybe depression. 
but whatever i got to talk to david. that makes me smile just thinking about it, we had an ok convo, i cried once or twice only cuz i care sooo much about him and hes going through soo much shit right now and i wish i could get there and make it better in some way!!
but he knows i care! and he cares about me too so everything is going good! 
well im off to try and sleep again!! i closed my eyes and see nothing(i try and think about good but i dont see him or it), and its weird cuz thats what david says he sees when he closes his eyes, its like were somehow connected and i feel his pain, and i see what he sees, idk ITS CRAZY!!!!

Marvin took me and nicole to my house, i walked in and my mom and sherrie were smoking in my house, and all i did was say theyre smoking in the house, and sherrie got this snippy lil tude and was like WERE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME. like that gives her a right to smoke in my house, all my shit smells all my clothes my whole room smells, and you know what i dont like it all the lights were on and the back door was open and my mom is always complaining about that shit. my mom doesnt even smoke in the car. and so anyways sherrie got her tude and i started yelling and she was like i dont need this shit and got her shit and was marissa thie is bullshit and i was like FUCK YOU!!!
and then she was like excuse me like she didnt fucking hear me and i was like you heard me and she was like yes i did and i was like then why did you just say excuse me and she was like you are soooo disrespectful and i was like youre fucking direspectful and she kept going on and on and on and then she left then CAME BACK and started yelling about me and i went up to her and was like why arent you ever at your OWN house and she treathened to call the cops on me HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. and then Marvin, by this poin im bawling, was trying to calm me down he did a pretty good job cuz ohhhhhhhhhhhh but Marvin had a lil talk with me and then we went up to sherrie and was like if you call the cops ill get in trouble and she was like ISNT THAT JUST TOO FUCKING BAD and i was like oh Marvin she doesnt care, she doesnt care about anyone but herself. and i was like i DIDNT threathen her life or her safty, there for if she calls the cops nothing will happen i had 4 witnesses and plus i hate her anyways so she can talk out her ass all she wants. but whatever its done now me and my mom talked and were cool. but my mom says i need to go to the docter cuz there is something wrong with me, and i think there is cuz i dont know why i cry or why i blow up like that and i never have gone off like that, but damn did it feel good to say some of that shit to sherrie, but anyways my mom thinks i need meds, i think im depressed and maybe bi-polar and yeah. but im going to bed now so later.

<P>i remember when i was love sick -- you block out everyone.<BR>you feel so tired..because you haven't slept in forever.. you<BR>know that he'll be in your dreams .. but you don't want to <BR>stay awake laying in bed crying either. you're starving but<BR>you cant eat because you're starving for him &amp; every<BR>memory just leaves you a bigger hole in your heart. even<BR>your clothes remind you of him..what you wore when you<BR>hung out. you can still smell him all over them, even tho<BR>his scent hasn't been there for long. you wish his scent<BR>would be stuck on your but you know you'd be pulling<BR>at your skin trying to get him off you. you're online, he<BR>signs on, and you want to yell at him to go away, but you<BR>just watch the screen waiting for him to say anything but<BR>then he signs off and you tear yourself apart for not saying<BR>anything to him. you stop talking to your friend, they get<BR>worried and try comforting you but they just make you<BR>feel worse b/c they think they know, but they don't .. they<BR>don't have a damn clue.</P>
<P>^ and that love sickness has never gone away and i want to know will it ever go away, i need to talk to him, i need to know how he feels about me, and when he comes back are we going to try again? does anyone understand what its like to sit up and think about the what if's what if i hadnt broken up with him, what if i didnt care what people said, what if i didnt need him, what if i was just happy? what if this? what if that? but now ill never know. when i see him i need to tell him exactly how i feel or ill never forgive myself for not telling him.&nbsp; LOVE KNOWS NO AGE, LOVE KNOWS NO MILES, RIGHT? if thats so and he loved me and i love him we could do, right? i just want to know if i need to move on, cuz my heart is telling me not to but my head is telling me to, but every other time i listened to my heart it got me depressed. </P>

But it made me laugh and i felt a lil better.

So last night i went downtown with Megan, and Lisa, and we hung out with Donnie and Monte. And we ran into Matt, Jeff 1&2, Ray, Lee, Mark, and the fat bastard Mitch. And then i ran into my TOUBLEMAKERS. And there was bubbles in the fountains and I played in them, got something stuck in my foot, and got wet and soapy. And then we were all sitting by the fountains, Matt, Jeff 1&2, Ray, Lee, Mark, and the fat bastard Mitch, Megan, and Lisa, Donnie and Monte, and thes two drunk guys came up and were talking to everyone, then they left and I was like yes cuz they were freaking me out and then they came back so I decided to go sit by a guy I knew so I sat by Ray, thinking ok he'll protect me. NOPE I WAS WRONG, the guys came up to me nd Ray and he got an inch away from my face, and he started singing, and it sounded like he was saying, YOURE GOING TO BE A STAR, but im not sure. And i was freaking out and you could tell, and Ray just sat there laughing at him. I was scared. Then Megan and Lisa and I were sitting out front of the book store the guys went by and were like PSHHHHH PSHHHHHHH, and Lisa was like WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT. The guy turned around looked at us and kinda started to walk towards us but we got up and ran. Then we decided to go home so started walking and we got to the Save-Alot grocery store and Donnie stopped and made the guy that was driving him home drive us to my house. Then we came home, got ready for bed, Then watched part of The Boggeyman, but we got too tired and we decided to go to bed. So we did.



This morning Lisa woke my ass up at 11:25, and I checked the messages on the phone, woke up some, took a tinkle, got online for a lil, then got a shower, then found something to wear, then come got online til my hair dried a lil, and then I went into the bathroom and blowdried my hair a lil, then I straightened my hair and did my mke up. Then Megan Lisa and I went a took the SCAT BUS to the mall.And we went to the pet store and we held the kittens and then we held a Yorkie. And met up with Donnie and hung out with him and his friend Dan who, goes to church with Megan and I. And we shopped, Then we got hungry so I spent $20 on food and $20 on 3 shirts. And then Dee came and we all hung out and shopped. And then we all missed the bus 2 times the last 2 busses, so we chilled at the mall, Lisa ate and I saw Matt and Jeff so me and Megan went a said hey and we talked for a lil, and then they went to Aero, and i only saw them once after that, and then we talked to the guy at Beepers and Phones and he is going to sell me a phone soon, HOPEFULLY. And I held two turtles and now I want one real bad, actually i want 2 so the one isnt lonly(Lisas idea!!!) Then Dee called her mom and her mom came and got us and took me home and let Megan and Lisa get their stuff and took them to Megans.

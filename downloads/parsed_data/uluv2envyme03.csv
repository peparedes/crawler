"event","What a few weeks it has been for me! But my worst day was yesterday, when i recieved a letter in the mail from a very, very close friend.  He is in jail right now, and will be there for hopefully a little less than 2 years. We started developing a relationship while he was out, and we got reallly close.  Then right before he went to jail we lost contact.  Well i found out his address and i wrote him a letter and we have been writing back and forth for the last 3 or 4 months and the first letter he wrote me, he told me that he had got back with his baby mother, because he thought that i had a boyfriend and didn't know how to tell him. So i told him that i would stay out of his relationship, and not cause confusion...well i get another letter last night and he is telling me that he is thinking about us, and he is confused and doesn't know what to do, so i was feeling really crappy yesterday, cause it's like i never meant to cause confusion and in all honesty i really think that he needs to be with his baby mother for the baby's sake...ya know? but yeah it hurts like hell, because we relate to each other on many different levels...he said i'm unlike any woman he has ever met, and i told him he is unlike any man i've ever met...who knows what the future may hold for us, but i know for one thing..i'm in no way going to try to force myself into the picture and mess up his relationship....WHAT SHOULD I DO YA'LL?"

I talked to Laron on Saturday afternoon and we really got to talk and share feelings.  I wrote laron a text message about 2 weeks ago that said i was tired of trying to win his heart when it should already be mine and i told him that when he thought about what he wanted to do or what he wanted to say to me then to call me.  Well he called me Saturday afternoon, and we talked and we came to a resolution....i understand that he not ready for a relationship and he understand that i'm not gon wait for him to be ready...we'll see how this goes and where we'll end up at....we'll see...."

"event","i have officially asked God for a resolution and i believe in my heart that i will get one! All a person can do is pray and ask God to GUIDE you to the right choices....hopefully now that i have officially asked things will turn out differently for me, but i think that me and laron are never going to be together..there is NO trust and NO respect...i don't trust him and he don't trust me and he sure as hell don't respect me! I'm soooo emotionally tired and sooooooo fuckin' drained! I just don't get it!!! Why does it seem like everybody in the world gets to be happy and it just always seems to skip over me? i think that maybe if i gave up all hope something would come along...i;m so physically and emotionally tired!!!! Now this nigga at Alicia job tryin' to talk to me, but i don't know if he is serious or if he is just playin' i think that he might be for real, but then there is the issue of laron...i'm not over him!!! and i don't know how to get over him, maybe i need some dude to come and take my mind off of him...or maybe i need to let laron know that it's all or nothing........i don't know, but i know one thing i'm so tired of him fuckin' wit my mind........."

"event","I did it again...i let my ex Laron back into my life, and now i'm starting to wonder if it is even worth it to pretend like i can help loving him. I think i feel like i invested so much time into this that i have to make it work! I believe that he does love me, but he just isn't ready to accept it yet, i'm not going to wait forever, but he needs to realize that ain't nobody gon take care of him like i will.  I love his 2 lil sisters to death, and i love him to death.  I just don't know what's left to prove that i love him UNCONDITIONALY! i guess tha questions i'm going to ask him are: Explain to me exactly how you feel about me...on some real type shit.  Is there a future for us as being more than friends? If yes...are you ready to be wit just one female?  How do you think i feel about you? Do you think that i could be a positive influence in your life? Does my love and friendship mean anything to you?  I pray everyday and every night that if this is no good for me then give me the strength to leave it alone and find something better, but i always end up back wit him. I just don't know what to do and i'm so fucking confused!!!! I'm talking to other niggas but none of them make me feel like he makes me feel! We understand each other and we have a bond unlike no other! He knows me inside and out and i know him inside and out! There is nothing like the feeling of butterflies in your stomach when a person walks into a room, looks at you, kisses you or even gives you a hug! I'm just so SPRUNG! <----there i said it! I'm sprung!lol...that nigga got me hooked! He knows it and i know it so now i'm admitting it! lol...I'll make it work! Or you know what he gon make it work!lol...he asked me to go with him about 3 months ago but i didn't say anything, but i was considerin' it, but what really stopped me was my friends reactions, but i have come to realize that you can't always listen to what other people say.  Who knows what may happen, i'm gon keep my fingers crossed and if he calls me tonight we gon have a REAL discussion. i'll keep ya'll posted! Oh yeah i start my regular shift at work 2morrow! yay! 3:45p.m.-8:15p.m."

"event","Well i don't even know where to start right now....i've been talkin' to my ex lately and he just ask me today if i wanted to hook up again! We have tried this shit 2 times and it has failed both times and they were both my fault. I confided in him that i was ready for a committed relationship and now he thinks that he is ready for that too. I don't wanna jump back in this and end up fuckin' up again and hurting him for the third time! That shit just isn't me! We have known each other for 4 years and he has been in love with me for 3 years even though we were only together for 1 year! It seems like no matter how bad i fuck up he is still there, and he won't go anywhere! I love him too, but i'm so scared that i'm gon hurt him, because the person i hurt him for the last time is still in my life and as much as i try to convince myself that i'm over him...i'm not and i don't know how long it's gonna take me to get over him FULLY! and i don't think it would be fair to jump into another relationship when my heart is not out of the other one! I just don't know what to do.  But if we do hook up it will be way in the future and i'm not sayin' that i'm gon wait on him, because i'm not! He still has a lot of growing to do..maybe to much growing....he really isn't doing anything with his life right now and he doesn't have a car meaning i would have to be the one driving and i just can't do that! Oh yeah yesterday this nigga called me and said ""what would you say if i called you and asked you to marry me?"" i was sitting there like..""WTF?"" i told him that i would say no, because he isn't ready to be a provider and i NEED a provider! I'll take care of you physically and emotionally, but i'm not gonna be providing EVERYTHING! He said that he understood that, but i don't think he does! I LOVE his mother to the ends of the earth and his sisters are great also.  Me and his mother have the potential to create a really strong and positive bond.  His sisters would do anything for me and his nephew loves me like an auntie..he even calls me that sometimes :) it's so cute! but all of that is not going to change the fact that he needs to get it together....welll i'm bout to watch t.v. and wait for him to call me back so i can tell him that there is no way we can get together right now...he just isn't mentally ready and i'm not emotionally ready...i'll update soon..."

Right now i'm in the process of looking for another job, because i hate the one i have, and also i'm don't have a boyfriend at the moment, but i think i'm ready to have one, because it's been a couple of years since i had a real real serious boyfriend, and i think i'm ready to have that again, but the people who i want to start a relationship wit, ain't really good choices...one of them is such a fucking sweetheart and everything, but his sister is a bitch and he is younger than me and i think he might be a little to young for me if his sister is 18 and i'm 19 and yea his sister is older than him, but i shouldn't let that stop me.  The other choice is a nigga who will be going to jail in January for 2 years! I really, really, really care for him more than words can explain sometimes, but i have to let him go and if we are meant to be together than we will be together when he gets out, of course my momma don't really approve of him, but i think that if he was my choice than she wouod eventually accept it, she would really have no choice.  She doesn'tunderstand the fact that yea he a thugged out nigga, but i don't see that side of him, he is so gentle and kind with me and we understand each other on every level...he's 21 and he gotta a baby, but that is stuff that i can look past and get over.  Right now i'm on the phone with one of my best friends Lee-Lee:)  she prolly sittin on the phone watchin' Buffy....well let me get off of here and go do some thinking and get myself together!

I've been in touch with my ex boyfriend and it seems like we are talkin' again, but i don't know if it's such a good idea, but i can't help that i love him sooooo much it hurts sometimes! I don't think my closest friends understand that sometimes. This nigga been in my life for 3 yrs how could i not be attached? I know that he loves me, but we are both scared to take it to that next level, because it ended so bad the first time.  He still has a lot of growing up to do and so do i! I think that we have both grown on our own, and now we need to try to grow together! There are some things that he has always done and continues to do that pisses me off, but i told him i'm not stuntin' him like that no more and if he wants to play the games he can gon head and unplug my controller and WRAP IT UP, because i'm 2 old for the games and i refuse to play them with any nigga POINT BLANK! He understands that i moved on b4 and i can move on again no matter how hard it may be for me!  I was over his house on Wednesday and we chilled and watched part of a Lifetime movie(lol) while he was peelin' sweet potatoes for his mama.  His cousin and his brother was there too...they cool peeps 4reel! His brother and his cousin ended up leaving and we chilled some more and spent some much needed(on my part) quality time together...i have to say he is always there when i need him..he never ceases to show me the kind of attention i need!  Now on to this work bullshit! I need to be sleep now, because i have to take my ass to work when i just got off at 6:30 this morning and then i had to wake up at 10 and take my cousin somewhere and i didn't get finished with that until 3:30 and now i gotta get ready for work at 11..i'm tired as fuck and i don't know how much more of this my body can take! I'M TRYIN' YA'LL!!! Somebody pray for me! Leave comments if you read and advice! Night~Night World!!

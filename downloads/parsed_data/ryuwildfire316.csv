It's too late to cry I love you.
The wind still blowing, my heart still aching
One side of my eyes see tomorrow,
And the other one see yesterday
I hope I could sleep in the cradle of your love, again
Cry for me, somebody, with dry eyes
*The real folk blues
I just want to feel a real sorrow
It's not bad a life in the muddy river
If life is once
Hopeless hope, and the chance with traps
What is right, or wrong
It's like a both side of a coin
How long I must live till I release?
The real folk blues
I just want to feel a real pleasure
All that glitters is not gold"

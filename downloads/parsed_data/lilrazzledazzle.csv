"event","*my mom was being super bitch lastnight I came home and there was no dishes so i got online or w.e well my entire body has hurt all day long anyways so i decided to lay down for a little bit so that i wouldnt be such a bitch to everyone because im so sore , well my mom comes home and shes looking for my brothers shoes and her and my brother end up in my rom and they are going through all my stuff looking for his shoes and it all turned into a huge argument because i was sore and i layed down so she told me not to touch the computer or the phone since i cant stay awake and that turned into an even bigger argument because i was awake i was just laying down.so i ended up sleeping all night from like quarter after 4 - 4:30 till 6:30 this morning.i really dont care though

*well nothing else really to write i guess il update later.

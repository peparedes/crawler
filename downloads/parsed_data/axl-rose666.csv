"event","Reet where to begin, as i looked through my latest post i forgot i put in a list of places where i wanna go, and well, now i am, i am off to Australia on October the 25th till i forget when, but that doesnt matter, all that matters is im fucking off to Australia :D. It was kind of one of those days where you wake up and do something with your life, and at the same time i have reasons to go so whey, thts that sorted.

Was nice to see the premiership flag raised today outside Molineux, sort of made it sink in a bit more :P, but i know newcastle fans read this so ill shut up about that now. I cant think of many films ive seen, drag me to hell was ""ok"", i didnt even jump that much!, im known for jumping a lot, and i kinda like it as it grips me, but this just didnt really, but like i said it was ok, i laughed so hard at the talking goat tho, wtf was that all aout eh?. Star trek was amazing, it didnt even seem as long as it was too, and simon pegg shud of had more to do as scotty, but im not gonna complain that much as it was good. I really cant remember much else, ill try *thinks*, nope, but i am looking foward to Terminator 4 and Transformers 2 tho :).

Nice to see Roger Federer in the French open final...again!, just he better win it this time, his 4th fucking final!, so ill be wacthing that tomorrow, much to cassie's approval lol!, erm...i havent bin to footie recently, im just trying me best to save as much money as i can really, but i am gonna start playing tennis soon, cassie said she wud play after she gets back from download as theres a place near hers that has a court, and i wanna play it here too as we have the whole astro-tuff thing going on, but nobody seems to have the time :(. In fact nobody seems to have the time to do anything these days, well, whenever i wanna do sumthing anyway :P.

Me dad's having a BBQ today for his Birthday last wedensday, dunno how that works out but i aint gonna complain at me burgers going down :P. Speaking of which Joe had one last Tuesday, that was a gd day out, even tho i only had a saussage sandwhich as i had already eaten, hey if im hungry, i eat :P, anyway he was kind enough to let me watch wor rogers QF on tv, then everyone else joined making jokes about the travel adverts, and the watch advert that chris seemed to love, haha!, i love eurosport. Anyway i think thats about it"

"event","In the past month i cant remember anything really, other thn being stupidly happy :p. So i really dunno where to start and ive forgot what ive already mentioned. 

Went out last Sunday night to Sunderland with micky moo and gav, they rang me at half 12 asking me to come out, so i thought why not, which was much to there surprise, but not mine, if people actually bother taking the time to ask me to go out, i do consider it. So that was a bit of a random night but alright.

Bin to see the uninvited which was alreet, and the only other thing i remember seeing is, errrm...whats it called, ah yeah Wolverine :D went to see it saturday and sunday last week with various people, and thank you to all who went, everyone was on time :D, and ive seen both endings to it, which made me go :D.

Then i seen it again on wedensday with cassie, and her pics are werid, you can pay like an extra 75p for premier seats, which is like, seats at eye-level, and we tired to get a 2 for 1 orange deal aswell but her phone went fucking mental, but the guy was kinda enough to believe us so let us go in 2 for 1 anyway. I left cassie's thursday afternoon, got home, then ended up going to jarrow to hand in a few CVs into various places. And friday...i just relaxed i think, and thought about taking up archery since theres a place a know that does it now.

Went out to the prince yesterday for moo's bd with micky, cookie, salt and both campbells. Was pretty good fun, even tho me and micky wun at pool i still havent got any better thn the last time i played lol. Moo liked his present i got him anyway, was like a framed picture of the different eras of newcastle utd, and he was well chuffed with it, so whey!.

Today, is today, and im just thinking about where i wanna go away to next, me mam says shes gonna pay for bits of it for me 21st aswell so, just need to figure out where i wanna go, switzerland, finland, texas, alaska, italy, too many places i wanna go too, but hey, least im never gonna be bored :P, im gonna do a little list aswell to bore people

Places ive bin to                        Places i wanna go
France                                   U.S.A-Texas, Arizona, Alaska, New York, Chicago
Germany                                  Australia
Netherlands                              Italy
Cezch Republic                           Finland

U.S.A-Florida                            Sotuh Africa


Tried to level it out :P, obv theres much more places i wanna go, but theres more places ive bin to, like, Jersey!, Glasgow! etc lol. Im gonna end up going sumwhere i didnt expect to, i always do, like i didnt have to go to amsterdam when i was in germany, but i thought id take a de-tour anyway, i was in my ""specail"" shop the other day too and seen like ibiza for like, 135 qwid for a week!, if i was sad, id go :P that place might aswell now be part of the UK. Anyway im ranting, and nobody cares, and nobody will read, and on the buses is on :P"

"event","Right, ive probably done a lot a cant even remember, so bare with me. Im only doing this since chris finally got round to doing his, so hes kinda made me wanna do one :P

I went to glasgow to see fee a few weeks ago, and it was at that point, i actually decided to get credit on me phone!, yeah i know, i wasnt thinking stright, anyway, went to see lesbian vampire killers, whch was pretty damn funny for what it was, just a basic british comedy. Seen Stu's band live aswell, not my cup of tea but it was a night out anyway, other than my pounding headache!. Which brings me to my awkward point.

Back in the day i wasnt exactly, afriad of women and telling them how i felt, if you get me drift, but it seems that a few break-ups took their toll on me, and really knocked my confidence in that department. I liked cassie since, god just before xmas, but basicaly all you need to know is after a long time, we finnaly met up, and now were together.

Went to see Fast and furious, kinda brought back why i thought the 1st one was ok, and why i refused to watch the other 2, it was alright once it got going, but i just kinda left the pics thinking ""hmmm"", erm, went to see hauting in whatever its called, that was good. The boat that rocked was great!, much better thn i expected, erm, i see why chris had trouble talking about movies here, i shud really have looked at me old post before and seen what i had seen before i started. The unborn was such a creepy film, dont get me wrong i love horrors and what have ya, im just a really jumpy person, and when i get creeped out, you fucking know about it, a dog wearing a mask, wtf is that about!, and plus i hate creepy children anyway. Monsters vs aliens is really good!, i loved it, same with Bolt, he was awsome.

Wolves are now promoted :), oh well.......yer like thats all i was gonna say :D:D:D:D HAHAHA!!! man i was sooo happy when i heard that whistle!!!, i even shed a tear, the only time weve bin promoted in the past 24 years was via the play-offs, and to (pretty much) win the title, was incredible!. One of THE best days in football to me so far, ill never forget it, it still hasent yet quite sunk in in im honest, i think it only will on the last day of the season when i know our next game will be in the prem. I just watched a video too of the celebrations, I wondered who it was tippping the bottle of champange over McCarthy, turns out it was mark Little (a player who has bin out all season) and McCarthy jokingly said ""its Halifax on loan for you next season"" LOL! class!. Im well chuffed about it all, as you expect but i really do have high hopes for us now, we did so well, and many people even kept saying in as late as Feb ""your gonna fuck it up"", oh yer?, fuck you :), and i think gav has blocked me aswell after i layed it all on him lmao, he was soooo not getting away with that :P.

Dunno what else i can add really, i cant even remember if i talked about berlin!, i think i did, i dont think it was that long ago i did a blog so i must have done.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h54uYZ8kq84 just because its hilerious, is on a camera phone but whatever, mick tried to say a few words on the mic (cnt see it very well if at all) so he throws it to the crowd lmao"

"event","This isnt a post about anything other then X3, im writting it so i can come back and look at it when needed

Ive bin so wound up on the whole deadpool theory i decided to calm down and read the novel X3 (The one based on the movie), and after reading it some of the death scenes actually make a lot of sence since we never really got to actually see ""scott die"", so i looked up what happend to him and heres what was said:

(About Logan) The metal provided an anchor for his physical being and at the same time, the outrush of power from her acted as an amplifier for his own abilities. He hadn't seen Scott die, but he could guess what happened. She amplified his optic blasts, so much that he damn near shattered an entire mountain, but all that really did was complete the energy loop back to her. Blasting at her actually made her stronger, meanwhile Scott had no defense against the discorporation process. Same with Xavier. His telepathy must have been heightened to an unimaginable extend, but even if it put him on a level above her, he could not match her telekinetic powers and he couldn't repair the damage she was doing to him. 

Logan, of course, was another critter altogether. 

The harder she hit him, the more efficiently his body healed. She couldn't kill him, only make him stronger. If she really wanted him gone, there were ways to accomplish it. Throw him away for instance; he had no doubt, at her level, she could put him into orbit with a thought. If he was still here, it was for a reason"

"event","Even tho i cant sleep im in a very good mood so i thought id talk here and tell everyone (even tho most people on here wud know) about whats bin going down. No idea where to start, and i dont wanna talk about it a lot as i would be here all day, but my trips to Germany, Amsterdam and the Cezch Republic were simply an amazing experience, i thought i wouldn never get a chance to ""tour"" around bits of europe, but i did and i met some new friends along the way, Xutan, Kim, Sharah and many more i keep in contact with, its just great hearing about other peoples stories, and people who actually want to get to know me (for a change) lol. Prague in my opinion was ""ok"", Amsterdam i can only describe as ""Amsterdam"", if you have bin before you know what i mean, and Berlin is a city you must see before you die, its great fun, pictures and videos only tell like maybe 1/8 of the story i had, i havent botherd to tell many people about it that much unless they asked things, that way i know that there genrally interested.

Went to see Bolt which is great!, hes soo cute!, i really cant remember anything else ive seen, OO, that new clint eastwood film aswell, that was amazing!, hes still got it ;), um today i watched bits of a copy of the watchman and its exactly what i expected really, very camp and full of sex, so i missed half of it through bordem then watched the last few bits since me bro in-law insisted, but why wud i wanna watch a naked blue guy doing rape lol? i know it was as 18 but jesus man. I really cnt think of any other films ive seen ive bin that busy, but there is this one film...

..called X-men origins: Wolverine im looking foward too :D, just been watching X2 aswell and for people to say that as ""basicaly a wolverine movie anyway"" is bullshit, he has about much screen time as magneto and jean grey, if not less. People always say i get far too exited over these movies too, or any marvel movie, all i can say is sorry for being a fan? if you dont like what makes me happy, fuck off :), not my fault FOX, Sony, Marvel etc decided to make movies about my fav comics books since i was a kid. Anyway where was i, i had already read Wolverine: Origins, so i have an idea how the movie will pan out, exept with the introduction of Gambit and Cyclops!!, they have nailed Gambit down to a fucking T, and he even has the accent!. I guess FOX finally thought ""okay, we get your point people you wanna see gambit, here he is"", rather than waiting for X-Men: First class or another movie to be made where he still wouldnt really fit in, but from what ive seen so far he fits in here, just hes gonna be older than cyclops if they make any movies with him in past X3 :P. Also im looking foward to the DVD already, it didnt really work being a wolverine movie but Wayde Wilson (deadpool) broke the 4th wall apparently (which is where he turns to the audience and makes comic remarks as he knows hes a comic book character) on a few outtakes and they were gonna leave 1 in but obv it just didnt work as your really not meant to crack up in a wolverine movie lmao, so bring on the deadpool movie if thats what FOX is thinking of doing. 

Btw if nobody knows what deadpool is like about breaking the 4th wall, this is a good example, NO it has nothing to do with the new wolverine movie, its just some dude doing an amature movie acting out what hes like called ""deadpools day out"", its fucking hilerious, he takes a funny dig at luke cage too :P,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujVOhVVzUM and after the credits it isnt finished!

So i have that to look Foward too, Glasgow in 2 weeks, where im getting dragged to see Mall Cop which looks really funny, plus going to pics with fee is always a laugh anyway, we really shouldnt be allowed to go. Umm..i MIGHT be going to Spain in June for my 21st, for 2 days, to see guns n fucking roses!, and some other bands too like motley crue, papa roach, etc etc for only 100 euros for the 2 days, lol. Its an idea anyway, but at the same time i wanna go to Wolverhampton for Wolves last game of the season, so i dunno what im doing, but nothing wrong with having a few ideas in me head."

"event","Im up far too early, so ive decided to have a bit of a rant. Not that much as gone on life, but ive had quite an interesting social life lately lol. 

Went to see ""the wrestler"", which is one of my new fav movies, maybe just because im a huge wrestling fan, but more so as it was so real, people really dont reilise what them people go through and how it really isnt all that fake, shit does happen, not matter what you do for a living. So i really enjoyed it as i thought i would have. Went to see sex-drive, it had a few ""giggle"" moments but apart from that, i got bored as it was a bit predictable, so since at the time i had finally had credit!, decided to text all the way through since every sod does it now days. And seen valkyrie too, that was great!.

Bin told theres about a 15% chance of me going to the arctic for 10 weeks for like a global warming research trip!, but the training for it takes place when im away in Germany, so ive bin told i need to go up today and find out if they can train me seperatley. If i can go tho, ill be giving the whole world a big ""fuck you"" :P, but i aint getting my hopes up, but still cant wait for Germany/Amsterdam now like, a lot of people (mainly women :P) think im ""brave"" going alone, when really its not difficult, even when i get ""lost"", how can i be lost if i dunno where the fuck i am anyway? i cant be lost in a place i dont even know, so its just a giant adventure, and how can i afford it with no job? with great difficulty, but when i put my mind to something about 90% of the time ill make sure ill go through with it, otherwise whats the point in having ideas?. It seems like everyone i know to wants to go to Amsterdam aswell, ive bin before like, and im going again :P, im gonna state the obvuious here but its just a cheap place to get drunk/stoned, to me its not that special, thats why i turned down fee to go in Jan (even tho she didnt go anyway lol), as it wud have just bin me, her and a few of her mates, i would go off to explore Holland, and they wud godo there thing, so maybe im starting to figure out that going alone to places is probabaly for the best, lord knows ive asked enough people to do shit. 

Anyway moving on to my ""interesting social life"" lately. Been talking to a girl called Tara from Texas a lot, she seems really canny, and apparently i can stay there for free if i ever go to Texas, i will :P, but weather or not its near her is a different story, but hey cant argue with a free home lol. Been talking to a girl called Thae too from Croatia, she aint rang as of yet as her phone is shit for signal, but shes a bit of a travel-buff like me too, shes awsome!, shes invited me to a rock-fest in croatia too, obv i probably cant go, i mean i cant do everything, but im gonna try, plus shes well cute, more reason to try lol.

Gonna start learing to ride a motorbike/scooter soon too hopefully, obv i dont want a scooter, but you have to start off on the smaller engines i guess, lessons take place in gateshead so it aint too far. Me on a bike doesnt sound that safe to be fair, but it beats driving a car anyday.

Um nowt else really, said i was gonna rant and i did."

"event","Well this week was quite eventfull, decided to actually spend some money from me bit savings for germany, i probably shouldnt have, but i think im just gonna have enough for what i wanna do. Monday i didnt actually do anything, i was just too stressed about shit so just lay ni bed all day watching movies. 

Tuesday me and gav went to the aquarium, which was pretty awsome, them otters are sooo fucking loud! lol, and when gav went to the toilet i got into an argument with a woman in the shark tunnel as she said ""Oh look isnt he a big one"" and i kinda mutterd ""yeah, SHES big"", and then she went into the whole im not an expert and i dont work here so it cud easily be a male, but of cause i proved her wrong as the black tip came back round :P, oh well, shouldnt argue shud she, bitch. Anyway after the aquarium we took the wrong metro and almost ended up going backwards, took the ferry there and back, had a few insides jokes about the old women lmao, getting lost a few times in north shields, was just a good day out.

Wedensday i went around Newcastle with tayla as i had to show her how i get pretty good deals when going away, mind you it was hard since my ""special place"" wasnt in newcastle, or is it ;), anyway after that farse, went shopping for a bit before going to see ""yes man"", which is fucking hilerious!, welcome back jim :D. Tayla is shit scared of sharks too, and im shit scared of clowns, and she loves them, so hey, you can guess the fun we had with that lol!.

Thursday Marko and Micky came over for more ""retroing"", crying with laughter was quite common, as we ended up dying 3 times and using up a contine on lion king in about, 3 mins lmao!, and i think markos turn lasted about 10 seconds, which went for aladin, we used about 6 continues on this bastard level, and marko killed himself within litrally about 3 seconds, *level starts, have to just jump onto a platfrom, he misses it* lmao!, then he did it again, and went over it!!, anyway we didnt clock any games this week, which were the ones i said as above and global gladiators. These retro nights really are a good idea as nobody takes them that seriously, the only time we ever got serioes was when me and micky tried to clock taz and we did, mind you that fucking lift level!! lmao, and when dave brought over tekken tag last week, mind you that was for ps2!, we shouldnt have bin allowed to play on it :P. 

Today again doing nothing, off to jarrow for a little bit as im gonna go check out the current euro, thn lorna's coming round tonight before she goes back to York so that shud be fun, i might make her watch cliford since shes bin asking where i got the name ""stephan"" from for my baby triceratops.

Anyway thats about it, i think i might be geting credit soon since im gonna need it, ive seem to found a few people these days who actually do text, even tho they are at work and text me when im watching me neighbours!, but still, ill let them off because there nice. Mind you i probs wont get any till after Germany, hehe cant wait to go now, and i keep forgetting im going to amsterdam aswell!, and maybe prague if im feeling risky."

"event","No idea why im up this early, and i have nothing to say either, well, thats a lie as im talking now :P. Xmas shopping almost done!, i hate this time of year, i seem to just like xmas eve up until boxing day, then its a drag till new year, then everyone goes out to get pissed? was it just me or did nobody care about ne wyear until the year 2000?, probably just me but in 2006, that was the best new year ever!, 2007 just spent it with sister, and this yeat, i dunno, i mean nothing can top 2006, and ive grown acustomed to just doing my own little thing for what seems like everyone eles ""big"" thing.

Im sick of being stubborn too, i never used to be, like around women as most people know, but now if i like sumone, i just dunno what to do so i just plod along. i not really gonna get into detail about women anyway, my life with them has been a soap opera :P.

X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, looks fucking amazing, but i believe i already spoke about this already sumwhere, but i dont care, it looks a lot darker than your typical x-men film, not dark as the dark knight (haha), but just as dark as you would exept it to be. Plus i dont get how people moaned about not having gambit movies, and some people are now moaning hes in this!, you just cant win lol, the x-men movies are just a different take on the comics, like different drafts get mixed together, and gambit does have a history with wolverine anyway, and from the look of the trailer it looks like he has a decent part. The only character i feel they shud have never used yet in ANY marvel movie would be venom, he had sooo much potential! but he sufferd the fate gambit WOULD have sufferd if he was in X-men 3, id rather have gambit in a decent role, then just give him the venom treatment. Anyway im ranting again, But people shud go see it and not be a knock off nigel, this movie does well we shall have a X-men origins: Magneto movie, where he probably goes around killing nazis, and then X-men: First class, about the younger mutants, rogue, iceman, angel etc, in which hugh jackman said he would probably have a cameo in so they can tie together, i guess that cud be classed as X-men 4 but without all the characters that hogged the screen in the first 3.

I knew id talk about x-men more thn anything lol!. Been playing old retro games thnx to ""Angry video game nerd"", people shud check him out, hes really funny, be he clearly has too much time on his hands., anyway like a toad in flushed away once said ""Enough Dancing!"""

"event","Thought id blog to pass time waiting for Match of the day. Steve coogan was mint last night, i loved how hes has so much shit from the press, and comes back with this, hes great.

My trip to Germany is no longer a trip to Germany, Im going to amsterdam at some point onthe way bk since i made my flight coming back from amsterdam lol (dont ask), im gonna be going to Prague hopefully, trains run frequently apparently so i may aswell see whats there one day, and im gonna try and go to Poznan in Poland, about 3 hours away from Berlin, looks nice as i just found out the time tables today, im useless at sleeping when i go away so ill be fine with all the traveling. I remember when i had to be up at 4am to walk a few miles and get the bus at 5am to go to Banff when i was in Canada, and i was up at 2 so i think my trains usually leave at 6am from Berlin, so getting up shouldnt be a problem, im always too exited to sleep anyway :P, i remember thinking when i was walking the streets of Calgary, you could see the rockies in the distance, and i said to meself ""ill go there tomorrow"", and i did, if theres one thing i like about me its quite often if i say ill do summit, i will, i hate being pulled back, i almost didnt go away at all because of money issues, and i still technicaly cant go way!, im just ploding along, as its now booked and once i get on that plane, that week is mine, all mine :D, yeah okay i do want people to cmoe along, but as i said before, i hate being pulled back so whatever lol. Im gonna get lost too, i did in Canada for quite a while, and it was great meeting new people, like, outside Calagry, so now im all exited about going away again, but worried, again, trying to contact people before i went away was a nightmare, like nobody eevr cared lol, and even when i came back i think only fee rang me up to see if i got home okay. I could turn this into a rant now but im too happy :), Germany, here i come :D, Itl be like, in 2 years and 4 months, ive been to Canada, France, Germany, Amsterdam, Poland and Cech Republic, and for living on EMA and random bonus's, I even remember from Jan-May 2006, i spent nothing on myself or anyone else!, it all went into Canada, if you wanna go sumwhere, you easily can, just have to stop worrying about whats in front of you, because the people that know me, know i worry all the time about the future, but sumtimes theres no point to it, id much rather spend my money on exploring places ive never been to, and thats what i intend to do in my future :)

What else...theres this girl....haha, yer right, But on a more serious note, ive met loads of new people this year, Talya, Cassie, Kyla, Stacy, Fin, and Andre who i met meeting bret hart and i keep inconatct with him, shame hes not from Amsterdam as i cudda met up with him (hes from Netherlands), and Dean-o, haha, and hes from newcastle!, i really shud try and see him more often. 

Anyway enough ranting, and im done a lot of that just now, gonna watch Match of the day, Stick a movie on, eat all the junk food i want, can i ask for a better saturday?....no"

Fee came down nd we went to see Dylan Moran which was class, i made her watch jack aswell, everyone shid see that movie before they die!. Just had the usual night in as we do, lol! nd we were gonna watch robin hood since there ws no point in sleeping at 2 as we had to be up at 5, but we both passed out on me bed anyway nd thn just ended up getting kip at hers for lee evans! :D, ah he was fucking hilerious!, all new material as usuall ""when your in the car, its always a panic when your FUCKING SEATBELT WONT COME DOWN!, ur like HANG ON!!!, IM GONNA DIIIEE!"" lmao! and ""how did dinosaurs evolve from birds, like they just went RAWRARWRSDAWRDSWS- - tweet tweet!"". Then just had the usuall glasgow weekend followed by me 2nd tattoo, actually hurt more then me back, but it was shorter, nd i made fee get me sprite nd crisps for suger lol. Note to anyone, if you get a tattoo, have looooads of suger, really helps. Alos i fell downstairs in solid much to fee and alans amusement, it was one of those falls where you just slip and slide down the stairs, so in the end i looked like a ""starfish"", that hurt anyway lol.

Cant stop listening to chinese democracy, for anyone who doubted axl rose can fuck right off lol, hes a genious! i DID NOT take 14 years to make it, i mean for 2-3 years he had no fucking band!, and its been done since 2005, just he had loads of disputes with record labels, and he hasnt been just doing ""1"" album, so i wish people would just give him a break, and i cant wait for the next album to come out, which apparently will be next year or 2010 after a tour.

Seen Jimmeeey Carr!, that guy is a comic genious aswell, i just love how he takes no shit from anyone yet at the end of the night everyone walks away loving him. Going to see Steve Coogan soon aswell, so that shud be good. 

House is finally finished, exept the back bedroom needs decorating, but downstairs looks a lot nicer and my room seems the same, but i think since i put everything up and helped decorate it, i feel a certian amount of pride lol. 

Going to Berlin in Feb!! and on the way back spending 10 hours in Amsterdam, so well looking foward to that, since everyones shit for going away :P. Get to see knut the polar bear too :). And i might attempt to have a day in Poland, but if you go certain ways you can get stopped so i might be getting arrested but hey, like i care, im just trying to enjoy meself which is the main thing lol. 

Wolves are kicking ass!!, 46 points from 19 games :P haha suck on that!, its about time we started to murder the league, we had the potential last year but lost many players and couldnt replace them, but now, weve lost probably more players, but we have the cover so its good, and if we get promoted, the way newcastle are playing atm im gonna have a good go at some people if ever theres a week were above them, no more of this ""average championship club"", so i guess thats actually sumthing to look foward too.

Movies...well, not a lot to say really, all been a bit shit exept maybe quarintine which i didnt jump at since i had a fucking light over me head. And there was this one movie me nd gav were lost in, and couldnt get into it, so we thought ripping the piss out of it wud be more fun, and it was, i was in tears! been ages since i had a really gd laugh with gav so it was kewl :). And i seen the trailer for Wolverine too, GAMBIT!!! :D, hes only in trailer for like 6 seconds, but hes wearing likea purple jacket, and throws his bit cards :D, also, The Blob is in it!!, fighting in like sum boxing ring of sum sort. Looks a really good movie, and Fox are writting X-men First Class too, which is basicaly a movie about Rogue, Iceman, Colossus, Shadowcat, Jubilee and other young ones, so that wud be kewl, maybe even include gambit in it since hes now part of the movies, nd for anyone who might say ""no he wont because hes in wolverine and thats before x-men"", well apparently Scott sSummers makes an apperance in wolverine too, so were just gonna have to wait nd see how it pans out. 

""For Chris"" - I seen Deadpool for like 5 seconds dressed in like a red robe fighting with swords, i guess it might be before he got scared, or he gets scared in the movie , who knows, but he looked kewl, as you can guess trailer was mainly wolverine and sabertooth. 

This is a long blog aint it, im not used to it. I sumtimes feel like im drifting away from certian people but coming closer to others. If i ever do anything with sumone, ive noticed its always the same thing, which results in they only ring me or talk to me for the same purposes :s. oh well. I feel as if i need to say other things, but i cant remember. Erm, Jim Carrey makes his return to comedy next month with ""Yes Man"", looks your typical jim humour :D. Ive missed him.

"event","Just thought id do a blog on ""Chinese Democracy"" fuckers!!, haha, i love laughing at the doubters :P, so yeah, if you dont like guns nd roses, or axl rose, no point in reading from here. My faith in rock music has been restored, been listennig to country/folk and the usual stuff froms the 80s, but now i can relax knowing ive been saved, finaly, sumthing from the 2000's which is worth listening to, rock wise.

Chinese democracy - Good opening to an album, stright to the point rock/grunge type song.

Shackler's Revenge - Very different rock song from what were used to hearing, and thats great!, which makes for a great song, can see people hating this one just because ""its not the real guns n roses"", get over yourselves, this is a damn good rock song

Better - Possibly the most catchiest song on the album, its like 15 years all of rock music, compresed into 1 song. Very raw!.

Street of dreams - November rain meets queen here. Fucking amazing this song, cud have eben a tad longer, but its the quality, not quantity

If the world - Spanish guitars eh? not sumthing id thought id hear axl try, but he pulls it off, takes a while for you to being to reilise whats going on in the song, but its worth it.

There was a time - One of the best songs on the album. Solos are just fantastic, slash who? :P, ok so i still do love slash, but this is the type of song which justifies axl being the brains behind the band all along.

Catcher in the rye - Another queen type of song, but more edgy, i love it. Its just immense how the whole song builds up, its a nice surprise this song.

Scraped - The usual grity dirty guns n roses type of song. This is the type of song people will feel as if it shud be on a different album, and i agree, but after hearing the whole album, it fits in well with the 71min journey. Great song if you give it time, like ""if the world""

Sorry - ""almost like doom metal"" sabastien bach said, to me, it reminds me of a young david bowie song, but i see what he means with the chorus, such a diferent and unique song, its great!

Raid N' the bedounis - Again your typical guns n roses song, without slash of cause. So sumthing will always be missing on these types of songs, but it maks up for it with axls creativity.

I.R.S - I heard this at download for the first time and i thought ""man, this is just amazing, how has the guy made this music and nobodys thought of it"", like i said back then, its one of those songs that will be stuck in your head for ages, and you wonder why nobody came up with it before, guess they aint called axl rose thats why :P

Madagascar - Most peoples fav from all the ""leaked tracks"", even tho it was only a demo, the song must have been remixed again like with ""street of dreams"", how the fuck can axl improve a fucking amazing song is beyond me!

This i Love - (no pun intended) i love. November rain/Estranged type song again, dunno why the rest of the original band hated doing these songs, this song grips you, and makes you think of what he was thinking when he wrote it, the man has always been a mystery, and long let him be if he comes up with shit like this :D

Prostitute - The name of the song actually means axl not selling himself to us, as its what the song is about, such a powerfull song, and a wonderfull song to close the album.

9.3/10, Guns nd roses will always be my fav band, and axl will always be my fav singer ever, but the only reason this aint a 10 is becasue not of Slash, but Izzy, if izzy had helped axl with the songs, i cant imagine what would have been made. Another 2-3 albums are apparently coming out and sabastian bach has heard most of them, basatrd lol, but he says ""This is just the begining"", and i second that, bring it on, the god of rock is back, like it or not!"

"event","Guess i should blog about what happend on Monday first :P. I asked joe chris and dave to come see the luchagors with me, so we headed up to trillians, and stright away i got butterflys, like HMV all over again. Anyway i see amy (lita) stright away when she came out, so i persuaded chris to come over with me to see her, as i also bought a CD, which i got signed by the whole band, and she noticed me stright away as i sent her a message on my space saying ""look out for me, ill be wearing your t-shirt and i dont look no different from 2 years ago :P"", so she noticed me stright away and said she got the message and even called me by my name :D, then i decided to buy a t-shirt for the hell of it. 

Then the gig started, and me joe and dave got near the front, which was awsome as the guitarist shane told me to hold a fret for him as she strummed away :P, was well chuffed. Then amy kept coming bk over our way putting her hand on my shoulder, i felt special :P, i didnt see much of the bassist mind, but hey, i was like nose length away from seeing amy do so pretty awsome moves on the floor in front of me ;) haha. Anyway they played the whole album, and it was just awsome, none stop punk, the way it shud be with no slow-it-down moments most gigs have these days, i mean wtf has punk came too i kept asking myself, there IS no punk music left, its just god awfull hybrids, so seeing the luchagors has really put me back into liking punk again, sex pistols, the clash, iggy pop etc, so i have to thank amy for that too :P, restoring my faith :P. 

After the gig, she promised me a photo, so i went over and got my photo with her and my tshirt signed, i told her she was awsome and just just gave me a wink and said ""i thought you might say that"", so i just laughed and when bk to my seat where people finished off their drinks, then headed off home, being the happiest ive been in a long time :).

Erm, nothing really interesting to report really now, went to see the strangers which is scary shit, and dave wouldnt stop laughing everytime i jumped, went to see step brothers too, thats pretty funny. Went to joes on Tuesday, reilised the drum kit for rock band is exactly how i thouhgt it wud be, awfull lol, it can be okay improving your hand-eye co-ordination, but if you played that then went on a real drum kit, its too different, bass pedal is far too small too, in fact the kit is too small, and far too noisy!!, there already was a drum simulator, its called electronic drums. Anyway after that we played quiz night, which was ok, then hullabaloo, which again, was alreet, guess im just not a one of playing games when people are drunk, but still it was fun watching joe fail at everything lol!, like badminton horse trails lmao. Anyway left for footie, then got home and downloaded a shit load of movies :P.

And thats it i think, Watching the footie at chris's last night, about time englad preformed mind, i was getting impatient with the international team. Anyway thats enough"

Great laughs as usuall, went to see the mummy 3 aswell, where since we bought revals, i stuck two maltesers up ma nose and did an ace ventura fireing them out lmao, had to be there moment :P, we also couldnt stop laughing when in the movie johnathon (can never spell that name) shouted ""die you mummy bastards die!"", it was a good movie although i think they shud of killed off eve's character since rachel didnt play her, but overall was good, and a dragon was in, 3-headed too :P!..and it seems everytime i go to the pics there we end up buying popcorn and minstrels and mix them together lol. erm...also got made to wear a face mask thingy, like you put all these cream on ur face and it hardens and you wash it off in 10mins, and you couldnt smile/laugh once it hardend so i had troule watching jaws when i wanted to show any emotion lol. We also bought two dinosaur torches each!!!, there class as they rawr too :P. i cant really explain anything else that happens in glasgow as nobody wud really care lol.

Finally finished college, in which i have chris and fee to thank for not letting me quit really, so now i need a job, got a few things lined up and people/companys ringing, but i just dunno what i wanna do that sounds simple, i dont care about the money long as i get paied enough to be hapy with (id be perfectly happy with 200 a month since ive lived on that for 18 months), so yeah anything simple for now, and i suppose i have to shave me green goatee off lol.

Footie season started today!, so i have my eventfull saturdays back! :P, wolves drew 2-2 today playing away in appaluing conditions so good stuff, 45 games left lol!.

And i know ive always mentioned this about people/friends changing but they do unfortuently, figured it out as i got picked up by glen at 4am on wedensday, and i just clicked everyone i know has changed, weather it be for good or bad, and for him it was both, hes matured a hell of a lot, but as soon as he got lost in central in the fog, it was like we were 12 years old again :), and when i was waiting for me bus i just couldnt stop laughing about it, and then i reilised how the hell i wasnt that upset when we stopped talking, he was the only friend ive eevr had whos never been afriad to smack me as hard as he could and then still laugh about it, everyone who hits me these days does it because they actally mean it, and i figured i wasnt that upset about loosing him as a best mate as in a way fee became glen, shes just the same, but feamale, only difference is i talk to her about more serious stuff than i did with him. which then about after an hour got me thinking about everyone else and if they had changed or not (my ipod was in the bus compartment so i had nothing else to do until edinbough ok!), was werid, upsetting, and funny to think about. I dont think am gonna worry about that anymore tho, i know for a fact i will never change and have everyone around me that i wud want anyway, but it was nice seeing glen again after what, 2 years, there was no awkwardness at all, im just waffeling now since i havent spoken on here in ages. 

Rents go away on the 28th of august too for a few days and i think beany from cambridge is coming up, so that shud be kewl, exept she carries the south african curse (ive gone out with two south africans already, 3rd time lucky?), and its my 20th soon :(, 20..i mean...20!, i dont know how to act like an adult never mind being one, i was brought up in a semi-stupid family, and just gah! lol, i mean people look foward to growing up, and being 20+, why!!!, you just closer to dying and people expect you to act diffrently than you did 10 years ago, why, because of your age? anyway this rant is now done as im going to go get fooood and watch men behaving badly"

I was gonna post in about 2 weeks after ive been to glasgow twice but nooo somebody got impatient! hope you feel loved now. Theres a video of me dancing and falling over in our hotel room if you want me to send ya it

Anyways, i have about 2 weeks left on my course then i head off into the job world :( i dont suit adult life, even joe will tell you that in morissons, if im not around people that enjoy life or dont take things too seriously then it just puts me down, so hopefully ill find a nice job. Off to Glasgow on Friday since my rents are away, you would think id stay at home and have loads of people over, but lately nobody does anything, so i figured id head up and see fee since im allowed to whenever i want :P. Then im going again the following weekend since joe nd chris are up anyway, so i figured id show them the ""glasgow nightlife"" :P plus itl be fun. Would be nice if the farm gave me i job but i doubt it, they never seem botherd when i go away, or im off ill, there so laid-back and not at all bossy, which is why ive stayed for nearly a year now. Er what else have i been doing, i dont think i blogged about disneyland, that was great!, although i lost my voice in the first day through screaming like hell on rides i hate. Dani (fees mate) was canny too, was just the 3 of us so being the only man i had to put up with some unplesent stories, but im used to that now. Got my beard dyed pink which hurt like fuck, and constantly preving on hot french women was fun :P. And just in genral being away with friends and at night talking about random shite was great. Too many of them ""you had to be there"" moments, like one were they noticed my fly was un-done, so i turned away to do it up, and then there was a little kid watching, then i turned the other way and a group of kids were there, dancing in the streets at night, trying to chat up waitresses, mid-night photography, me putting money into an arcade machine, taking forever to try and work out how to start, then using all my amo, not knowing how to reload and dying within 14 seconds and not getting another try etc, like i said had to be there :P. Indiana jones comes out soon :D, looks great, so glad they kept the original theme , think im going to see it on saturday, then hulk and batman to look foward too!. Bowling last week was pretty good too, and pool, aswell as the gd old dance machines!, Anyway the phones just gone so im gonna head off, hope that was interesting enough for you Laura!! lol"

"event","Yikes...well what a fucking week ive had. Sunday went to see ""Walk Hard"" which was really funny, and i got a random phone call on Monday asking if i wanted to go to London, and work was a bit of a disaster with everyone having a ""blonde"" day lol. ANYWAY, enough of this,

Tuesday i went to Wolverhampton :D. After much speculation of moo and gav turning up, they did and off we went. I could be bother to talk about the jounry there and back but im too knackerd off coming bk from London last night, but anyway, the sat nav i think pissed everyone off at some point, and the traffic lights lmao, i said before i left that wolverhampton was the first place ever to have them, and boy did they have them, everywhere!. Got checked into the travel lodge and shit and saw rabbits and a fox :D, had a ""relax time"" and then went off to get beer for people and to go to the wolves shop which is still apparently my fault we were late getting back, but consider this, when moo says ""the shop should be open after the match"" the word ""should"" isnt good enough, i didnt travel all that way and miss out, so i only spent about 5mins getting me new top (after much deciding with chris :P) and scarf :D, then on the way back moo missed the travel lodge twice so spent about 40mins on the M62 which me micky and chris just didnt think was that real to be happening, gav was in a world of his own, so for us being late i blame moo not working :P. Then..the match itself!!, ah was absolutly fantastic!, missed about 3mins of the match but apparently not much had happend anyway according to the guy in front, and then KEOGH SCORED!!! :D, hehe thts when my voice never stopped all night, but then they scored and i guess you could say game on. Henry had a shite match tho, so i had sudden outbursts of saying ""aww henry man"" the second he got the ball...and jarvis had an amazing match on the left wing, but its clear we need kightly craddock and murray back, murray is so much more vocal in the box and craddock is a much better captin then henry lol. Half time got some nifty photos taken by gav, and a few of the wolves legends played charity golf, and they were all shite at golf so made the event more humerous, and 2nd half cud have went either way, but in the 91st min ebanks-blake...BANG 2-1!! i went balistic! :D, cud never have been more hapy at that point. so i stayed until the very end then we headed to the pub for a bit where gav broke his phone and moo made some un-canny remarks i wasnt pleased about but nevermind. Had the same taxi driver driving us back, so we had the whole joke about da jai voi?, got back anyway, played cards and spent the whole night playing sharades which was hilerious. Gav was first to go to bed, then moo wanted a bed of his own the homophobe, but neither me chris or micky were tired, and he stayed up till about 3:45 then eventually went to bed so, micky went about 5ish, then 6ish lol (still playing sharades and messing about) and i nodded off about 6ish. Woke up, had a shower sttack, all got food nd shite then left for home, was a bit upset about leaving mind, not knowing when ill see wolves again and stuff but i had a really good time, wolves wun, had a laugh, and made the joke about moo's not working a joke ill from now on always use)

Then went to london friday night/saturday morning, and got talking to some werid aussie bloke who wouldnt stop talking at the bus stop about roads and trees. Got to london about 7ish and had breakfast in victoria place (Hungry...Need a break?? :P). Met rosemarie then went back to hers for a bit and then went to London aquarium, was ws awsome!, can tell the sharks are well fed (if they wernt they wud be eating the fish sharing the tank with them) and they had Zebra sharks too :D, so spent about 35mins looking at them and then found like a touch pool were you can touch the rays, she took one feel of them and jumped since she didnt like the rough ones, but i had me whole arm in touching everything :P. Got some photos too which was good, and got a photo of her on the phone sticking her finger up at me lmao, long story. But the aquarium was huge, all underground too, even had turtels!!. Went bowling too which i wun 71-45 :P, sat around the park for a bit, had a laugh with the moving statues, almost got into a caffufel with a shop that shold shark, went for food, then i went home, And next saturday im off to Manchester to meet Bret hart :D and Sunny!! :P, so that should be good fun, anyway ive talked more than enough today."

Just came back from London too at the weekend, was brilliant, even tho i got lost when trying to find rosemarie, getting my tassels stuck in escalators, spilling things, being on the wrong platforms etc, was all gd fun..for her lol. And her dad is canny as out too, and really sarcastic lol, i dont think it cud have went better :). Went to see AVP2 aswell on both friday and saturday, was really good, much better than the first, but no queen :(, but the pred-alien made up for that. And this time next week, in an hour, ill be in MOLINEUX WATCHING WOLVES!! fucking rights :D ive been waiting ages for this day, i owe a big thank you to moo aswell for helping me organise it too. Italy maybe side tracked for a while since im gonna be going to London a bit lol, but im still gonna keep putting money away to go, and i think in future ill be going away as much as i can by meself, i did it once and it was great, nobody else can seemed to be botherd so fuck them, there loss :P.  And im also going to Manchester soon to meet BRET THE FUCKING HITMAN HART!! :D, gonna be awsome as i can ask him 1-2 question aswell, and i get to meet sunny too!, but nobody will remember her since back in the day i was a wrestling geek and nobody else watched it lol. She was the first ever ""DIVA"" really...and still looks hot at 35 :p. I keep thinking sumthing bad will happen soon tho, too much ""good"" stuff has/is happening/happend...and i need summit bad to happen to keep the balance. I also need to go back to glasgow soon, just for the crack to see the cow that is fee really lol, nah shes a living angel. Adopted another shark the other day, called UFO lol, bless him, has a scar on his left pectoral fin. I never blog in here anymore, i do smtimes...but i dunno, My life is too boring to read about really, people can argue it aint but i wanna be doing more lol. And now that ive been to both Canada and london by myself, i feel i can take on the world without anyone knowing lol, Canada was a big thing for me, and i still remember every hour of everyday, and coming back and everything seemed..shit, boring, and normal, so i try and organise things to look foward too, gonna go to leeds soon and see Paul aswell which shud be kewl, i miss our bitching sessions lol. Its only january and Im going to Wolves!!, meeting BRET HART!!, and found myself a g/f am quite found of :), roll on the next few weeks i say."

"event","Dont even know why i post on here now, i never even look back at what ive written, but im just gonna have a nice ramble. Canada was a whole different world, for me anyway, I dont care when people go on hoildays and just say it was ""OK"", for me this was a entierly new experience, and i can do what i want, when i want. One point sticks in mind was walking the streets of Calgary at 5am in the morning, listening to my ipod, then leaving the city and walked for about 6 miles and found a coach station which wud take me to the rockies, so i booked it and had to be there for 7 the next day, in which i didnt have any trouble doing since id go to bed at about 11 and wake up at 5 anyway. It really was a fantastic time, and a place id love to go to again, being massaged for one by hot women, a deffo on my to do again list lol. Also on that list is going to the rockies, which was just pure quality. The one thing i regret about that time was not videoing a live moose right in front of me, since i didnt want to russel my bag making noise, his antlers were half the size of me, and he cud have charged at any moment, but lukly for me he was just grazing and i easily passed him lol. The people were a little too friendly aswell, but in a good way, if you asked for directions, they'd draw you a map if they had the paper nd pen, they'd tell me everything and one even gave me his number in case i got lost again, in which i still have his number and may call him sumtime simply saying thank you. I cud talk all day about the time/adventure i had, but since ive gotten back, only half the people i talk too seem interested in what i do now. And in a way it hurts because ive came to reilise sumtimes having a good time (especially by urself) is worth nothing if you cant tell people all your stories and laugh with you knowing what youve done. Next time i go away i feel like telling nobody, like they will know the difference anyway lol. But on another note been to see resident evil 3, which i loved so much, and stardust which was good and entertaining. Erm, work/college is going smoothly, since i did a lot before i went away, half way through me course now and as soon as i get any work i do it stright away, an essay of about 3-5 pages can only take you an hour if your commited, thts what i worked out anyway, all it takes is a bit of motivation, and being in canada has given me so much of that. Im going to see wolves in january in which i have to thank the people who are going for, none of them support wolves yet there going anyway for the experience, and thts all that counts. And am im hoping to go it Italy aswell in jan-feb, im not booking it until after xmas since that can be a piss take of a time, but i will be going at sum point for 3-4 days. Ive had enough rambling now, so am gonna go read"

Then to pass time before me tattoo we played pool nd had a laugh nd shit. Then twas tatoo time, nd jesus christ it dont half hurt on the top of ya spine lol, the colour wasnt to bad just the outline, nd before i was finished i got sprite :D so i was chuffed, and the tattoo was amazing, just what i wanted, even tho chris had to put vasiline on every 5mins, that was painfull but a laugh. spent the rest of tuesday in pubs and talking. Went to a chinese buffet too, even tho i just pintched chips lol, got back to the hostel nd had shit sleep lol.

Zoo rocked!, forgot how much i loved it, polar bear was coote, and the black panther was a reet poser, and i bought myself a brilliant explorer hat!. Left the zoo went back nd got ready for a night out, that was quite good considering i always feel like shit when people get drunk and i dont, it just seemed different in glasgow, i cud talk to people and still have a conversation with them lol. danced with chris when less than jake came on, then danced with cara, thn danced with some random dude in the street lol. got taxi back and i got trusted to sleep on the waterbed :D, was class, thn after that we just woke up packed nd left really on friday, but i got my cuddly scar :), hes great, so it was brillaint even tho ive missed shit loads out, but just goes to show ya how small this world can be, hopefully im going up after ive been to Canada, in which is quite soon, and im kinda dreding it since...its just me lol, but it shud be great fun, just me, shud be very peacefull and twill be the first of many trips :)"

"event","Well im gonna try and remember whats happend since september lol!, i like a challenge

Started college off in shit fashion, i just didnt have any motivation after the death of steve irwin, and i cud not concentrate on playing any music by ""the killers"" or ""rammstien"", notice how i didnt get a choice in music again?, but anyway i wasnted botherd what i played but when people laughed when i said ""i want to do men at work - land down under"" it pissed me off, so i had a week off college, got called back into college on the monday, was at this point i believe i got to meet Billie piper :), she was lovely and it was just what i needed, and had a really funny/great day out with chris nd matt, and for a while i started playing fottie and going to the pics, so not going to college was actually the motivation i needed, but anyway i soon left college and explained that it was deffo NOT what i wanted after the incident with the class laughing at my own idea, so i got an interview on an animal care course, and got accepted thnx to my volinteer work and good refrences, so i think i start that in january, although i still have to sort some stuff out near the time. And on top of that i got really exited about RAW and when chris rang me up saying that amy dumas (lita) wa sin hmv, i didnt know what to do, so i cried lol, told moo and joey, left, threw up a lot, but when i got there it was good, and she smiled at my lita t-shirt lol, which made my day, well i say day but really when i think about it, had i still had been at college i didnt finish till 4, wud of had my phone off, and chris wud never have rang, so leaving college was a good thing, more than good lol, so anyway after becoming the happiest person alive, went to RAW and screamed when lita came out (even tho she was a heel "" a bad guy"" ) and lost my voice lol, but still had a good time, even tho steven was there and pissed me nd joe off all night lmao, going to football ever week is good too, im actually fit now!! *shock horror*, instead of being in goal constantly i play out now, and i just cnt seem to stop running half the time lol, still have iron maiden to look foward to, aswell as xmas, and have an interview tomorrow at poundland for a xmas job, well i say tomorrow i mean in 3 hours lol. Also found out danni McCormack has a band and amy dumas has a new band, so i wanna see them live when i have the money to go travelling, hopefully this time getting a photo of me and amy and not just her and edge lol, but still if you think about it, all of this happennd (well most of it, leaving college, new found motivation, animal care course etc etc) was through the death of steve irwin and actually reading amy dumas's book, both like me love animals, so i then watched a video in which bret hart stated that ""i dedicate this moment to all the people that believe that the biggest dreams can still come true"" so i thought, hes right, so here i am, about to work with animals when ive said all along i couldnt, so anyone thought leaving college was wrong, your dead wrong!! lol, i feel like the old me again."

Hey there :)

Wow, your profile kicks every square inch of most I've read on this site. I love sharks, I've been offered a job at Marvel and the paranormal is one of the most interesting things EVER. Plus you have good taste in music. Have you heard Guns N Roses' new demo Better? It's soo cool!


Well if I saw one in the water right next to me, I wouldn't want to go over and stroke it, but sharks are fascinating. I had to turn down the Marvel job though, I got offered it when I was 17 and I didn't want to leave my family. How stupid was I! I'll have to try again soon and see if I can change my answer lol.

I'm going out soon to go shopping (my clothes are litterally falling apart) but other than that, nothing exciting. What about you?

"event","Well what a random week this has turned out to be, for a start it wasnt pru at the train station, but she wanted to meet me on the wedensday in which i did, but first i bumpd into matt, randomly so he stayed with me until i had to meet her, thn there she was, a year and a half and hardly changed lol. anyways went for a ""2 year old coffee"",meaning we were meant to go 2 years ago, but anyway started talking about, everything, litrally lol, past g/fs n b/fs, life style, jobs, space, religion, race, her flat, her kitty cat :), music, drums, download festival, previous gigs, sharks, you name it bloody everything in the space of an hour, it was probably the best conversation ive ever had with her lol. anyways moving on, i dont think kirst is best pleased with me,shes worred im leaving her for pru, but like why wud i even wanna think tht? i sed think of pru as wayne (her ex whos now like her best friend), and she said like her n wayne were friends stright away and we become best friends after a year of not talking, well, many ppl may kno pru was my first love, so shes kinda hard to forget, and we both wanted to be best of friends, whats hard about that? yeah we had our differences and everything but thts in the past. so now ive made kirst feel like shit by making a ex g/f become a best friend :( sumtimes i wonder how the fuck i make friends at times.

well im off to college in a mo, gotta do more fucking rehursels for this damn gig :(, man im crapping it tht i might forget the lyrics or anything stupid like that."

I just really cnt be botherd anymore, i just wanna not worry about anything n were im gonna end up, i kno where i am gonna end up, i just wanna get there sooner rather thn later, or be told i am eventually, dont mean to sound big headed but i have the potential to become a shark vet but i wont be because i need grades in science and maths, which just proves the fact of life being fucking shit and people only giving out the good jobs to people who are inteligent, when i can easily do the same fucking job!, so even when college finishes this year in may i gotta go to newcastle college for 9 weeks to do a marine biology course, feels like my education is just never going to fucking end. if people mention work or college to me again this week im going to end up slapping sumone lol, i wanna remember my teen years as decent ones, not locked away at sum crappy job, theres a time and a place, soon as i say ""ive got no money"" ppl just constantly tell me to get a job, FUCK OFF!, maybe i like having no money, its a challenge to get it bk, i like challenges, i challenge myself every saturday to get on a train without paying, i challenged myself to produce my own album, im only 17, i can easily get a job in the summer, or when i leave college, i get ema, and thts more thn enough sumtimes, and another thing, i wish ppl wouldnt call what i like ""fads"", like its sumthing im going through :s, donating money to shark funds and adopting animals are fads are they? ok, yeh ill get over it, its just a fad aint it"

"event","Just braging here because i can :P, now...about axl rose...ppl saying chinese democracy is never coming out, and he had plastic surgury, well it is coming out, and no he hasnt

People will hear music this year,"" says Axl Rose, puffing on a cigar in the early hours of Saturday morning at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. 
The notoriously reclusive rocker is of course referring to Guns n' Roses' decade-in-the-making Chinese Democracy, arguably the most anticipated album in rock & roll history. ""It's a very complex record,"" says Rose, a surprise guest at Korn's tour announcement bash. (Others in the house: Jessica Alba, cast members of The OC, and members of Linkin Park, Good Charlotte and the Used.) ""I'm trying to do something different. Some of the arrangements are kind of like Queen. Some people are going to say, 'It doesn't sound like Axl Rose, it doesn't sound like Guns n' Roses.'"" He then smiles and adds, ""But you'll like at least a few songs on there.""

Dressed in a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey, cross hanging around his neck, cornrows still intact and sporting a blonde goatee, Rose strolled into the party around 1 a.m., just as the DJ was coincidentally rocking some vintage Gn'R. Approached by a steady stream of women and hard-rock disciples -- including Puddle of Mudd's Wes Scantlin and Papa Roach's Dave Buckner -- Rose is cordial and chatty as he poses for photo after photo. He seems more like an average guy out for a night with friends than the most mythical rock star on the planet in 2006.

And he maintains that that's exactly what he is. ""The only time people ever write about me is when I go out to a strip club, because I don't chase the paparazzi down,"" he says. And, when he's out of the spotlight, Rose says you'll find him doing average-guy stuff: reading books and watching movies. His favorite book is Philip K. Dick's A Scanner Darkly. ""I was a little scared when I saw they were making it into a movie starring Keanu [Reeves],"" he says. ""But I guess if he can handle The Matrix, he can do this.""

While Rose and his revolving cast of Gn'R bandmates have been working on Chinese Democracy, Papa Roach have achieved platinum status in their own right. But tonight, their drummer reverts to his teenage fan days, asking Rose for a picture and to guest on Papa Roach's next album. Rose strikes a pose and then graciously refers the fellow rocker to his management.

After all, before he lends his talents to others' projects, Rose has one of his own to finish, and he says it's getting there. ""We're working on thirty-two songs, and twenty-six are nearly done,"" he says. Of those, thirteen are slated for the final album. Among Rose's favorites are ""Better,"" ""There Was a Time"" and ""The Blues.""

As for a reunion with his former Gn'R mates, that seems unlikely. ""I haven't spoken to Slash in ten years,"" Rose says. ""I love the guy, I always wanted everyone to know how great he was, but.... I was just talking to Izzy the other day though.""

However, he hints that you could see the current incarnation of Gn'R back out on the road soon. ""Every time there's a big festival announced, we get rumored to be on there,"" he says. ""But we'll see what happens

And as for this ""surgery""...well im not saying he did/didnt because no one has seen him since tht gig in 2002...but its obvuious now that he looks fine...

where is the fucking surgery in that!!! you can even see him starting to get wrinkels lol bless him"

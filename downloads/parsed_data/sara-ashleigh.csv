"event","<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>Hello!<BR>In my last entry i didn't tell you guys about this weekend, and since the girls lacrosse team missed halloween for our tournament, i figure it is only right to tell everyone else about it.&nbsp; Jv2 did a really good job, and i played with them for the tournament.&nbsp; They are insanely amazing, and if you compare them to last years jv2... they're godesses.&nbsp; We ended up tying one of the games- against a regular jv-A team.&nbsp; Bellaire's JV-A team made it to the final game and our Varsity made it to the semi-finals.&nbsp; I think we did a really great job.&nbsp; But, as we all know, it's not all about playing... When Colleen and Sarah and Amy and I got to our room, we decided to pull down the comforters to make sure everything was okay.. NOT OKAY! there were pee stains on our comforter.&nbsp; gross.&nbsp; Saturday after the games we went to papasitos, instead of the olive garden. Maybe the team has outgrown that tradition? i'm not sure.&nbsp; Then a bunch of the girls went and played around in Wal-Mart.&nbsp; What a fun time.&nbsp; Sunday it rained at the games and then we came home, i stayed to watch the JV final game but Amy left early- since she had an injury she couldn't play at the time anyway.&nbsp; So the car ride home was done without Amy.&nbsp; We missed you, you tootsie-roll lover!&nbsp; Sarah's mom is special- and we love her.&nbsp; It was a great time.&nbsp; Here are some pictures from the trip, they aren't great though, because they're off of my phone.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Enjoy!... or don't (just don't complain)<BR></FONT></P>

"event","<P>Hey guys, i know it's been a while since i've written, but... it's my journal and i can do-or not do- as i freakin' please.&nbsp; Today was pretty boring at school, except Melissa, Gigi, and I almost got in to a ""fight"" to ""settle"" any ""issues"" we may have had with those particular girls... Psh, whatever.&nbsp; We might have won... so there!&nbsp; After school i went and bought the most awesome lacrosse stick in the whole wide world- the stx surge (yeah, Megan knows what i'm talking about... it's nice).&nbsp; When we came home my mom called and bitched at the cingular people.. it was quite interesting.&nbsp; And sometimes funny.&nbsp; Then Rachael called, which was nice because we hadn't talked in quite a while, she said she'd call back when she got to her daddy's house... but it didn't happen.&nbsp; Then my mom and i watched the OC, it was good for a season premiere, it was as good as it could be anyhow.&nbsp; Later Erik called and we had a fun conversation for a little over and hour.&nbsp; Then i showered. I smell pretty. Keep reading the journal for more updates.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I'm out like <FONT color=#cc33cc>Elton John</FONT><BR>Sara Ashleigh</P>"

<P>Well, it is friday.&nbsp; I didn't go out tonight but i was just as happy staying in. WELL NOT JUST AS HAPPY BECAUSE I DIDNT GO SEE THE RIFF TIFFS AND I DIDNT GET MY HUG OF DOOM. &nbsp; I'm so tired, it's crazy.&nbsp; So Drew and i made friends today, we weren't enemies but he thought i didn't like him.&nbsp; Why wouldn't i like him? If i don't like you, i have a reason for it (at the moment though i really don't dislike anybody, they just dislike me).&nbsp; Anyway, we are friends and he likes nickelodeon... perhaps a little too much.&nbsp; I have practice in the morning and i'm so friggin' tired. I really don't want to go but coach is so freakishly evil that because i haven't been at practice (SICK ONCE&nbsp;AND I HAD A DOCTOR'S ORDER FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS ANOTHER TIME) i have to play for jv2 at the richardson tournament.&nbsp; Talk about the last thing i expected.&nbsp; It majorly sucks.&nbsp; The second the tournament is over though, i'm back on jv.&nbsp; It's just the fact that coach would do that... it's not right.&nbsp; My mom said i should just quit but i think that's just dumb; i am not going to quit over one weekend of being pissed OFF.&nbsp; I'll just come back as jv and not ever have to worry about that coach.&nbsp; What did i do to him? Just played as best i could for him last year.&nbsp; ALSO saturday at 2 o'clock is the last emery football game, out in clear lake.&nbsp; Good luck you guys.&nbsp; Sunday i get to find out who my two little sisters are for bbyo.&nbsp; Exciting but i'm kinda nervous.&nbsp; I'm not so sure i would want me as a big sister. Maybe an aunt... not a sister.&nbsp; Oh well, hopefully they don't think like i do.&nbsp; I also am really wierd to my dad when i'm at his house (i am now), not on purpose it's just i have to adjust to the different kinda lives i have at both houses.&nbsp; I feel like a big jerk to him... i'm sorry.&nbsp; Now i'm talkin to David and he always makes me feel happier, not on purpose, there is just somethin about him.&nbsp; Don't know what.&nbsp; And i don't know what you guys think you are learning from reading my stupid stuff online or what i think i'm doing posting to see if you care... i guess i don't know much.&nbsp; Eh, not a huge suprise.</P>
<P>I'll post again... sometime</P>

"event","<P>SO, not only do i hate mondays... i've decided that i hate every day of the school week. School is so hard this year. I love seeing my friends and stuff but i really don't like school. I need to try harder i suppose. After this entry i'll go do more homework but i thought i would let you guys know that i love seeing you at school. And for the people that don't go to my school... YOU SHOULD BECAUSE SCHOOL SUCKS AND I NEED YOU THERE. kidding, sort of.&nbsp; Oh yeah, i hadn't gotten my SOPHOMORE school pictures back yet because i switched english classes... and well, the pictures didn't.&nbsp; I've been too lazy to walk up to 3rd foor East hall during lunch since pictures came out.&nbsp; Today i went and got them though, and they are much better than last years.&nbsp; Such&nbsp;a good thing too.&nbsp; Well, i've been stalling and i need to go do homework now.

"event","<P>hey guys. since sara is lazy and won't do this, i decided i would.</P>
<P>so this weekend was sara's dad's birthday. and since it was his birthday, she couldn't go to Cardi's to see the rifftiffs. and a very pretty youngin is in the rifftiffs. oh yummy those drummers. also, sara had her friend sandra over, and they had, as&nbsp;sara says, camel sex. sounds delicious. she also got a haircut. </P>
<P>saturday, sara went to her baby cousin's birthday party. he is now two years of age. they grow up so fast. they call him the ""cousin"" because sara is too ashamed to tell people that it is really her child. even though this child, ryan, is unfortunately not blessed with MY good looks, considering i am the father,&nbsp;he has cool hair. like ryan clemons. oh ryan clemons, what a big pot of boiling sex. also on saturday, she went to matt's house and watched the passion of the christ. and since she was tired and can't read or understand christian language, she went to sleep. but did call me to tell me that ben harper was playing at 10:30. what a considerate individual.</P>
<P>today, sunday, sara went to a BBYO meeting with me. and we ate spooy. and jared beau made funny faces. gosh. BBYO is just so interesting. then we saw blake and benjy. we were yelling nonsense such as penis and vaginal discharge in the garage of God. we are such good jews. you should give us a maccaroon. </P>
<P>then sara took me home from our meeting in her supa-fly truck. then i went to sleep. and sara called me while i was sleeping, to make sure i was alive, considering i am sick, for all of those who care. and i know you do. and now sara is talking to me, as i update this fabulous piece of art that we call a livejournal.</P>
<P>and since sara and i have no lives, and we are sitting at home talking on the phone about a certain sex god, i decided it was only necessary to post a picture of sara. </P>
<P><IMG src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v225/gloryfadesxx/sara.bmp""></P>
<P>what a hot piece of ass.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>i'm done. thanks for watching. join us next time for the FULL&nbsp;picture of sara. ha you wish.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

"event","So, this is my first entry in my wonderful Live Journal... i shall call him Relly... Relly the Live Journal (named after a very good friend of mine).  I am probably the only person who considers this Journal to be confusing.. but i do, so work with me here as i try to figure it out.  

Today I woke up too late to watch Rikki Lake, and i was extremely disappointed, so i watched Montel to make up for it... but it didn't make up for it AT ALL.  But they did have that Sylvia Brown lady on (she is a psychic, for you FOOLS out there who don't know, but now you do and  you can't say that you don't!)and she is pretty nifty.  After my morning talk show ritual, i got my lazy bum out of bed and started the laundry, which still isn't finished.  

I got dressed, hoping that i would go out some time today, but that never happened.  Eh, whateva.  Perhaps tomorrow will be a different story, perhaps. 
 
     And this concludes my first entry with Relly... Thank YOU, my friend, for reading. 

*We are glad you chose Relly:live journal, thank you, and come again very soon*"

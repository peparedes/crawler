Except about friendships, not about relationships.

I dunno. I treated one of my best friends like shit.
Repeatedly. Didn't try hard enough to keep in contact, etc. Didn't make enough time. That sort of thing. Kept saying shit would get better.

Just kinda not trying to get back in touch is the best thing to do for now right?
I've got no friends here, really. Brad, and Isaac (a coworker who I've started hanging out with recently), and thats really it.
I wish I was better at meeting people, or keeping in touch. I'm a little amazed at how easily others do it.
I mean-- Colin makes friends so much more easily than I do.

I also have seen nothing thus far that makes me not want to be disgusted with the Scott Pilgrim movie."

When she's around
I was on the tracks
When the gate came down
Suddenly I recognized
Those bloodshot rearview mirror eyes as mine

I heard that whistle call my name
I almost drove away
But Megan I had a feeling that you would be on that train
So I just waited there for you

Caught a ride to another town
Where the air was clean
And the sun never goes down
Everyone was standing in a line
Between the landing and the stairs

I heard somebody call my name
I almost climbed the stairs
But Megan I had a feeling that someday you'd meet me there
So I just waited there for you

Butter on a summer day
When I hear that name
It's a dream that never came true
Sat down on the tracks
And waited for a train to take me back to you

Somebody came and took my hand
I finally had to go
But Megan I just want you to know
That I waited as long as I could

xkcd 1049 points 1 month ago* [-]
If L is the length of the snake and T is the thickness of its body wall, and the snake swallows up to length S, the snake's growing diameter is given by R=2T(1+int(L/(L-S))).
Since the horizontal diameter of the snake-donut (measured out to the snake's axis) can't get smaller than the width of the snake, S is constrained such that 2T(1+int(L/(L-S))) is less than (L-S)/pi.
Say the snake in the picture is 1m long and has a 1cm body wall thickness. This means it can't swallow more than 74 cm of its tail before it closes up completely. At this point it will have swallowed its own tail nearly four times.
If you forgot to impose the length restriction, you'd find that the snake would contract in width but grow in vertical thickness, so you'd have the snake donut rising out of the horizontal plane toward infinity while contracting its diameter. However, this relaxed constraint means that opposite points in the snake donut that are both in the horizontal plane would start overlapping themselves, so the whole thing would remain as a sphere with a particular maximum radius. Though it's fairly straightforward, I'm not going to work out the volume of the resulting sphere -- because honestly I've had it with this motherfucking snake on this motherfucking plane.

"event","So I said I'd post this a long time ago, but I kept on putting it off. The truth is, I had it written but I really didn't feel like I had any reason to share.

Adam, as some of you may know, kept on asking me to explain myself, to tell him why I was so introverted, why I was the way I was, and why I act the way I do.

But here's my thing. I owe you nothing. I don't owe anybody an explanation for who I am, or why I am that way.
I may sometimes say ""Hey, I'm sorry that I can be kind of difficult"" or ""I'm sorry if I'm somewhat withdrawn or unresponsive emotionally"".


I was halfway through trying to justify why I am the way I am when I decided it was bullshit, and I just quit. Well. Probably not even halfway.
But this is as much as I got before I decided it was pointless, and before I decided that I didn't have to justify myself.  Why am I posting it? Why not, I guess.

<lj-cut>I don't talk alot. Or at least I'd like to say something like that, but I kind of feel like it's a lie. I guess it would be a little more accurate to say that I'm not really the talkative type. That I'm not outgoing, and that I have a really hard time striking up conversation with people. Though once I do open up, I tend to go on endlessly. Or something like that.
I'm really shy, is what it comes down to. I don't have a lot of self confidence, and there's really not much to do about it. And there's not really anything that I want to do about it. Yeah, I'd like to have an easier time opening up to new people, I'd like to have an easier time meeting people and getting to know them, but I don't.
And yes, I know that because I'm so shy I have the air of being unnaproachable or disinterested. But I guess I'd rather give the impression of being disinterested than come off as being pompous or elitist. Yes, I'd like to improve my confidence and self image and all that, but I don't really want to have a larger ego than I should.

But maybe it is safe to say that I don't talk a lot. Maybe you should tell me if that's the case or not. But enough of that.
I'm always thinking. There's always something on my mind. I'm usually going a mile a minute, and am sometimes too busy wondering where things are going to go and the way that things are going currently to enjoy how things are actually going. Which is a terrible habit that I've been working on trying to break. And I worry. I worry endlessly about what the person sitting next to or across from me is going to think of me. Well, not always. But I guess I'd say that I get nervous around people who I may have to be somewhat close with, because I don't want to give them a bad impression of me before they actually get to know me.

That's not to say that I don't open up, though. The people close to me would probably back me up if I said that I was boisterous and obscene, that I'm a fun guy or something like that, that despite my terribly cynical way of looking at most things, I tend to be optimistic to a fault. Or that I can laugh at anything, no matter how innapropriate it may seem at the time. But I know when it really is innapropriate. Or at least I like to think that I do. They'd tell you that I'm loaded with all sorts of caustic and sarcastic goodness.

But despite my introverted nature, I every now and then feel the need to come out and explain myself. To try and put down in words the person that I am, which I never end up putting up anywhere, or at least keeping up when I do because it's an impossibly hard task to undertake. To assume that one could explain oneself fully on a sheet of paper is either idiotic or pompous. But I guess I feel like I owe it to people to try. Because I'm really not always that forthcoming. I'm not the type to come out and tell people things about myself, at least not at first. And sometimes not at all.

I'm not a cold person. I am warm and affectionate. I'm friendly. I'm caring. I'm a hopeless romantic and a horrible dork, both at once. And I like that about myself. I like that I haven't become jaded by a few shitty situations, that getting dissapointed as badly as I have time and again hasn't turned my heart to stone, or however you'd go about saying it. That despite being terrified of the idea of being rejected by people, I still go out there and try is a huge accomplishment for me, I think.
I dunno. Maybe people just think I take things better than I do. Or maybe they I take them better than they think. I'm a man. I'm made of flesh and bone, and I'm hurt just as easily as anyone else. But just because I'm not melodramatic, or just because I don't want to rub everyone elses face in my misery, or push the blame off on someone else doesn't make what I go through any less real or severe. And it bugs me that people assume that things are worse for them than they are for others.
Again. I don't want to be one of those people. So yeah, I'd rather be stoic and a bit emotionally subdued than spend hours and hours trying to get other people to feel sorry for me. I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

But sometimes I get so jammed up in my head. Sometimes I just need to take a break from everything. And I guess that's why I run. Because when I run, I really don't think about anything. I just get 20 minutes of peace and quiet.

"event","So I'm becoming increasingly frustrated, in general.

My mom claims that she's unwilling to get involved with my college education at this point, and that she is ""leaving it up to me"", yet she insists on getting involved in every decision and questioning me at every turn.
I say ""I want access to my money, so I can actually pay for this and my books.""
And she says ""Well, I think you should do your finances this way.""
The problem is, that her way is more complicated than it needs to be. Here is the way things stand, as it is.

<lj-cut text=""Money"">There is the account that has the bulk of my money, which is at Charles Schwaab. That's money that was put there by my grandparents when I was born, and was intended to be used for school, etc etc. For the past 20 years or so it's been reinvesting, over and over again and accumulating worth, in addition to having been kept controlled by my grandfather until he started having some health problems.

Then, and this is where things just get annoying, there are a couple of smaller accounts that my mother started when I was younger. The thing is that she's not sure how many accounts she has, or even how much money is in each or any of them. The woman has at least 6 credit cards and god knows how many bank accounts.

So we decided ""Ok, well this is what we're going to do. We have about $8000 in this account over here. We're going to spend that, and then take money from the larger account and then we're going to use that for school. And then you can do with that as you will.""
Because that actually makes some sense.

Then we find out ""Oh. The amount in the second account is actually 16 thousand. So... we're much better off as far as all of this goes than we thought we'd be. How about that.""
That's fine. But the problem is that she's the custodian for the account still, and even though the account is in my name and has all of my information and things, I can't access the money unless her name is taken off of it.
I'm fine with this. I don't want her being able to have any decision making power in what I do. I want her to have as little involvement as possible. That's just how I feel about both it, and her.
Again, that's just how it goes.
She doesn't want to take her name off of it. In fact, she may have been actively lying about how much in the account so that I wouldn't waste the money, despite the fact that it's actively going down in value.
Whoops. Oh well. I have a month to figure all this out, and she's trying to complicate everything by insisting that I route the money through...  3 different banks.
She wants me to take the money from Charles Schwab and American Century and route them into a savings account with ING Direct. Because they have a really high interest rate on their savings accounts. And hey, that's fine, especially if they're going to be sitting there for a couple of months or so until their time of use.
But that's the problem. They're not going to be sitting there.
What she wants to do is route them from there at the rate of the payment due to the school each month, and then the day before they're due, transfer them over to another bank (my primary bank) where they can be automatically withdrawn from my savings or checking account.
Here's my whole problem with this. It's stupid.

What I think we should do is pull the 16 thousand dollars out of the money market account, all at once, since it's starting to decline in value anyway. I want to put it into a savings account  at either Charles Schwab or ING Direct where it can sit gaining money at a rather high rate (for a savings account) until I need it for school. At which point they automatically extract it.
I would, at this point, have all the dividends earned off of my Charles Schwab investments going into that same account in order to accumulate, and have the added bonus of adding to the interest gained on the lump sum already in there. This way I'd have to sell less of the actual stocks which have been allocated to me while the market is as far down as it is right now. This is a bad time to be taking money out of any investments, but it's the time that I need it. So I think I need to avoid selling as much as I can until the markets actually back to a decent point, and then I can set that money aside.

My dad, in the end, convinced my mom to take the steps she needs to take in order to get me access to the account. Her name is still going to be on it, though no longer as the custodian. I'm going to stray from the plan a little more by opening a separate savings account at ING, different from the one that she had previously opened up for me, so that she cannot keep track of or gain access to the account.

Which makes me feel like a dick, sort of, but whatever.
I love her, and I'm grateful that they've helped me out as much as they have, but I don't trust her to get involved. I don't like it.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""School"">I like school, thus far. Granted, it's been less than a week, but I like it. I like the campus, and how close it is to home. I do wish, however, that it was closer to work. I found a tiny little house that was for rent for a couple hundred dollars a month. If I lived there it would allow me to walk to work, saving me oodles of money, and getting me out of the toxic situation I'm in with my family.
I would, however, lose access to my car, as I wouldn't be able to afford it. And thus, I wouldn't be able to go to school, let alone do much of anything else. Even if I had my car, I'd be too broke. So I admit that it's an unrealistic goal, but still. A boy can dream, right?
I like my professors, though my Civ professor is claiming that he's going to be posting all of his powerpoint presentations on the Student Blackboard, though he hasn't done anything as of yet. Which frustrates the fucking crap outta me. Because I kind of was relying on all that, as he told me to email him about a question I had.
Also I can't get into my school email account, which is causing serious problems, as the professor uses that as his main approach to contacting us.
I've explained to him that I for some reason don't have access to my email, and he said ""well you must be doing something wrong""
But when I sit there for 20 minutes after entering in my password before it bounces back saying that I must have entered something incorrectly, I know what's going wrong. (a)I'm not in the system, or (b)they entered something wrong.
It frustrates me like crazy, but it's not so bad.
Theres a really cute guy who works at the school. Every time he walks by, I don't stare, but I glance at him very casually. It's a general sort of curiosity, as he walks around doing things and I'm never quite sure what they are. It's something that I'd be interested in anyway, but as a result of his obscene levels of attractiveness, my interest is nothing but compounded.

Lets try this again. I entered my email password at 9:24
Nothing happend.
It is now 9:26, and there has yet to be any sort of change or response.
To be honest, I'd completely forgotten about my sign in attempt until it reminded me significantly later.
Ah. At 9:29, i got a popup saying that I couldn't get in because i must have entered something incorrectly. Fah.

The only other problem is that they didn't give me a number to call if I was having any problems, as they very clearly explained everything and probably weren't expecting to have any problems. The problem with that, though, is that there are <i>always</i> problems. <b>Always</b>.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Work"">Work is only mildly frustrating. I like my job. I like, for some reason, what I do. I love the company I work for, and though I'm always skeptical about the things that they do, I'm generally fond of most of the decisions that they make. I feel that the company has the employees best interest in mind, as well as the customer, and the environment. And yes, their own. But they're not out to get rich on the broken backs of the laborers, and that's a big thing, I think. It doesn't matter that they don't have unions. I'm happier here than I was at Jewel, which was unionized.
My only real problem thus far is a person named Daniel. He doesn't work, and he talks shit. All the god damned friggin time. He gets under my skin like nobody else, and he goes out of his way to try to make me look bad.
What I mean by this is he says: ""This isn't our job, we shouldn't have to do this, blah blah blah I suck"". And I say ""Well go ask Jose, he'll tell you that it is.""
And so Jose comes by, and he says ""Hey, is it our job to do this?""
And Jose says ""Yeah, it is.""
And Daniel looks at me and says ""See, I told you""

He's lazy, and he's an ass-hat. There are a bunch of other lazy people in my department, and as it seems, only in my department, as the lazy people have been fired from every other one up till this point. Most of them , while bothersome, are forgivable, as they actually get everything done that they need to by the time that they need to, but just don't want to do any more than that. Daniel, however, just doesn't want to do much of anything and wants everyone else to pick up all the slack. His primary concern is his paycheck, and has little regard for the actual quality of whatever work he does. But I digress.
He's probably going to get fired soon. I'm up for a promotion, which would be kind of nice.
I'd have to take on more responsibility, but my hours would stay the same, and I'd get a significant pay raise, which I really need. So, huzzah.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Socializing"">I don't get out enough, and the window for that is about to go down significantly. But all that means is that I'm going to have to make more of an effort to hang out with everyone when I can, because I can't just work and go to school all the time. And while granted, I can hang out with Doug before/after work most days, and I can hang out with him after classes sometimes, but I need to see Meghan and everyone else too. Not because I'm all greedy and am like ""AAAARGH ONE FRIEND IS NOT ENOUGH"", but because Meghan and Rob are my friends, and because I care enough about them that I don't just wanna shut 'em out.
So, I won't. I'll find a way or something.

Things are going pretty well, though, all in all.
I have a bunch of good news, which I'm not going to really get into on here. Because it's personal.
(like all that wasn't, right?)
But it's actually personal, as opposed to just being a big update/dump about whats going on in my life."

Heres what <lj user=""sturmwalzer""> asked me.
<lj-cut>
1. Could you date a female-to-male trans person?
<i>No. I'd like to try and say yes, and be cool about it. And granted, I'd probably try, and it might work out for a while, but several of the FTMs don't plan on having bottom surgery, and to be perfectly honest, I don't think I could have a lasting relationship without sex. Maybe that's shallow. I dunno. But uh... that's just how I feel about it. It'd be nice to try, but I don't see it working in the end.</i>
2. You have the ability to bring one fictional character to life. Who would it be and why?
<i>Your mom.
But seriously? I want to say The Flash, or Green Lantern (Hal or Guy. You know how I love Guy), or some other incredibly awesome super hero, but there really aren't any super villains for them to combat, so they'd probably just get bored. And not really do anything. So I guess I'd bring the main character of Lady Oracle to life, because I'd like to read a book of her poetry. Because the little clips you got to read in the book sounded really good. Haha I'm such a nerd, right?.
The only other people I'd really like to bring to life are video game characters who are vaguely evil and would use their superior abilities to go on killing sprees and/or become terrorists. </i>
3. If you could have any weapon and kill any person without any consequences, what weapon would you pick, who would it be, and why?
<i>I dunno who I'd kill to be honest. I'd like to make some joke about it being Uwe, and that I'd use my bare hands because if I could get away with it, because, well. It's Uwe. What else can I say? I'd just kind of like him to feel the suffering he put all of the people who saw his movies through, except manifested physically. But I think he's probably the closest I could come to actually wanting to kill someone.</i>
4. You stop being a vegetarian. What's the first non-vegetarian meal you have?
<i>Wendys spicy chicken sandwich, no mayo. Plus ketchup. Or chicken nuggets with honey mustard. Or ham. In sandwich form.</i>
5. You get to spend the day with any historical figure - from Genghis Khan to George Bush. Who do you spend it with and why?
<i>FDR maybe. Just because he's awesome. Or John Adams (the First), so I could just ask him about going from a revolutionary to a president, and then asking what the hell happend and why he thought the Sedition act would be a good idea. Though I might wanna bring back Jesus, just so I could ask him if he was really just fucking with everybody, or if he was a schizophrenic, and then go on out and show him the way he's affected the world. And then I'd ask him about Crucifixion, because despite all we pretend to know about it, we really don't know that much about it.

Work today and tomorrow from 12 till 8:30. I'm catching the 11:00 am train and am getting off at 11:30, then riding my bike down from the train station.
Getting on the train at like 9 or so and riding it back home. Gonna try to get Hugh or my dad to pick me up around then. My car should be fixed some time while I'm at work.
Total cost of car repairs: 350 dollars.
Total cost of transit for this weekend: 5 dollars.

My problem is that when the PS3 Metal Gear Solid 4 box comes out, I was planning to buy it. It's 499 as opposed to 399, but its an 80gig ps3, it's supposedly going to be backwards compatible where as the 40 and 60 gigs are not. It comes with a 60 dollar game.
I see this as being a good deal. But oh well.

I still may be able to swing it, but I don't know for sure.
I'm going to be making a little over 500 dollars on my first paycheck, which is the 30th (i think), and then will be getting paid again on the 13th at around 480 dollars (minus taxes). Plus I may or may not be getting my Tax Stimulus whatever check depending on when it comes and if my mom decides to keep half of it because she's gonna be kind of a bitch :(.
Or if I get it at all (I should, but I'm nervous that I won't).

Excerpt from an online profile of mine:
<b>I spend a lot of time thinking about...</b>

I think about how Quentin Tarantino puts too much dialog into his movies (Deathproof being a fine example), and about how nobody seems to care. Because even though it's GOOD banter, and it's witty and funny, it tends to drag on. And it's a problem. And he knows it. But whenever I bring up this problem to somebody, they respond with: ""But it's a Tarantino movie. You expect that"". But heres my point. That's not an excuse. That's like saying ""Hitler did some very good things for Germany, but then he had to go out and commit genocide"", and then having someone respond with ""But it's a country ruled by Hitler. You go into it expecting that.""

See? Terrible things. Always.




It's true, though. Death Proof was funny as hell. But god damn that dialog went on FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER. Too long, even. And I'm sorry, but ""You expect it from him"" is the BIGGEST LOAD OF BULLSHIT EVER >:(

EVER. It's such a cop-out justification.
>:(


I'm kind of angry today, and kinda let down. I still haven't sorted out how I feel today.
If you ask me why, you get a kick in the face.
Or ignored. This applies to in real life conversations and IMs too. Just a heads up, for those of you who ask me about things I don't want to talk about but mention on here."

I don't say this a lot. I say ""I like this song"" a lot. Or ""I love this song"", or even ""I really really love this song"". etc etc. But I would say, I think this song is perfect. It's by one of my favorite bands, and it's not my favorite song by this band, but... I think it's a better song, if you know what I mean. It's the song, the lyrics, the whole feeling of it.

You can watch that one with it if you want to. It kinda fits in its own stupid sort of way.

<i>If you're tired of the big so so
Get yourself into some self control
Play the game by putting on the brakes
Slow down and make less mistakes
Nobody lingers like your hands on my heart
Nobody figures like you figured me out
I would be lying if I didn't say to you
No one comes close don't worry you got it!
(There's fire if you want it let me know,
I'm sick and I'm tired of letting go)
The way I feel when you call my name
Makes me go crazy to sane
The way I feel when you're close to me
Finally not drifting out to sea
Come on now I wish you would
I'm the one who makes you feel good
Never mind those things they say
They don't know it but I'm here to stay</i>

Silk, a bedspread, or a quilt,
Icing on a cake,
Or a serene translucent lake.
Daria, Daria, Daria,
I won't be soothed.
I won't be soothed.

When you tried to tell me
Of all the love you had,
I was cleaning oil from beaches
Seeing only what was bad.
When you tried to feed me
I only shut my mouth.
Food got on your apron
And you told me to get out.

I got accepted into Robert Morris College. It's a college, but they say that they consider themselves to be a University.


Uh...huh.


Anyway. It's not my first choice of schools. But it's close, and it's cheap. And I got accepted there. I'm not going for a BFA or anything. The program I'm going into is more designed focused, which is my general strength, I guess, as much as I get frustrated by it.


A lot of drafting, a lot of topography, a lot of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, a lot of web design and coding. Flash and animation, stuff like that. I think I'm going to like it.


I've gotten a couple small scholarships and grants. Plus a big one for 10k per year, so that's gonna cut 40 thousand total off the cost. I'm applying for two more right now, at $1000 each.



With all the money and aid I'm getting right now it's going to cost me about 6 to 8 thousand per year to go, which I really can't complain about. At all. That's without loans. It doesn't hurt that the school is pretty cheap already, plus I'm not getting charged for room and board.



The school has 4 academic years, but each year is split up into three 10 week quarters. It's year round. so there are 5 quarters per year, so I'd get my associates degree after 1.5 years instead of 2, and my bachelors degree in 3 instead of 4. I get Fridays off, all national holidays, and a couple extra days off for easter and thanksgiving and stuff like that. Theres a week off in December for ""the holidays"", and a week off in July for ""Summer Break"". Since I'm transferring in a bunch of credits, I might get off a quarter early, which would be pretty nice. Save myself an extra couple thousand dollars. Or maybe I'll just get to take a few more classes that I want to rather than some of the ones that I'd have to. But who knows, I guess.



I hate scholarship essays. i feel pretty lame trying to justify why I deserve this money more than somebody else."

By: <i>Marvin, The Android</i>

Now the world has gone to bed
Darkness won't engulf my head
I can see by infra-red
How I hate the night

Now I lay me down to sleep
Try to count electric sheep
Sweet dream wishes you can keep
How I hate the night"

"event","<lj user=""sturmwalzer""> tagged me for this. I'm going to do it with pictures like she did, but you don't have to.

<b>Directions:</b> List ten fictional characters you would have sex with (in no particular order) and tag five people to do the same.
<b>The tagged:</b> <lj user=""mmbaroque"">, <lj user=""kungfuechidna"">, <lj user=""rocketonaplanet"">, and whoever else wants to do it. Because I can't really think of 3 others I'd like to tag because <lj user=""sturmwalzer""> and <lj user=""skogul""> have already done it :(

<lj-cut text=""The Meme"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v90/kinderfresser/meme/Eugene.png"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""><b> Eugene</b> from <i>""Wristcutters, A Love Story""</i>. A goofy punk rocker with a Russian accent, who's distrustful and cynical. Need I say more?

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v90/kinderfresser/meme/Seifer.png"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""> <b>Seifer Almasy</b> from <i>Final Fantasy VIII (8)</i>. I've always been in love with his character, and I'll just leave it at that. Plus I feel like I can identify with him, in some weird sort of way. But like I said: I'll just leave it at that.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v90/kinderfresser/meme/KevinRian.png"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""> <b>Kevin Rian</b> from <i>Garou: Mark of the Wolves</i>. Because he's kinda goofy and he's a big strong guy. And I totally rock with him. And, for some reason, I find him to be unbelievably cool.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v90/kinderfresser/meme/GuyCecil.gif"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""> <b>Guy Cecil</b>, from <i>Tales of the Abyss</i>. He was my favorite character in the game. I just, for some reason, really liked him. If I was more of a fan-fictiony person, they would involve him.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v90/kinderfresser/meme/hayato.gif"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""> <b>Hayato</b>, from <i>Rival Schools.</i> Because he's hilarious and manly. I'm sorry but whatever. Shut up :(

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v90/kinderfresser/meme/TateYuuichi.png"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""> <b>Tate Yuuichi</b>, from <i>Mai-HiME</i> Because I think nerdy guys who think that they're really cool but aren't are kind of adorable. SHUT UP DON'T JUDGE ME :(
Assholes.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v90/kinderfresser/meme/Guy.png"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""> <b>Guy Gardner</b>, from <i>Green Lantern Corps</i> (when he's not drawn to look like a horrible goon). Because I'm a freak and apparently have a thing for redheads and people named Guy. SHUT UP. AGAIN. DAMMIT.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v90/kinderfresser/meme/cidhighwind.png"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""> <b> Cid Highwind</b> from <i>Final Fantasy VII (7)</i>. Because he's an asshole who hates everything and everybody. And he uses a fucking spear. And I don't care if he's straight.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v90/kinderfresser/meme/ZackWard.png"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""> <b>Dave Scouvel</b>. From the TV show <i>Titus. </i>He was Chris Titus' brother in law or half brother or something. He was pretty stupid, but in that really adorable sort of way.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v90/kinderfresser/meme/ArthurDent.png"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""> <b>Arthur Dent</b> from <i>The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy</i> (the book, not the movie. I used the picture from the movie because there aren't any pictures of the character from the book). He's not hot, or even really that attractive, but he's Goofy enough that I think I'd somehow be okay with it. Because we all now how weird I am about things like that. SHUT UP. :(


Everyone on here is straight. Except for maybe Guy Cecil, because they don't really say one way or the other about him during Tales of the Abyss, but it's pretty safe to assume that he is, indeed, a heterosexual.

Other runners up included: Jamie Madrox (Multiple Man), Joe Higashi, and a couple of others. At some point last night when I got to 8 and couldn't think of any more, I did ""a slice of Chicago Style Pizza."" included an image, and then said ""don't ask"". I thought it was lol but whatever.

Also I like this icon, so I'm gonna use it for this even if it doesn't fit.

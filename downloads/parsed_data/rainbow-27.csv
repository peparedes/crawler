OMFG.
That's all I have to say.

...

Nah, kidding. This episode has so much to talk about! But since I have no idea what to say, I'll simply try to remember it the best I can. Cuz I was unable to focus after it ended. Too much shock. *shakes head*

NALEY kisses!! HEE. And the baby's a boy! I made a bet with Mariana that it would be a boy! *wins* Haley pwned the whole eppie. The bathroom scene was great, Joy acted really well again. She's one of those people I can't stand to see crying. Cuz then *I* cry. -_-

And I didn't like Sophia's acting skills in some of the scenes. Those happen now and then, I guess. Meh. 

Loved the girls' roadtrip scene! LOL. 

Hated Deb. If she died I don't think anyone would even complain.

Dan was LOVE. OMG. The scenes with Karen and Lucas and what he did for Nathan... aw. He's awsome. ;)

Hated Lucas. Chad's acting was baaaad. Like, seriously. When Haley was hit by the car I REALLY didn't like him. And again the hair and the makeup? Gotta go. The L/P stuff was okay, and I liked the season 1 line, haha (cuz it's one of my favourites): ""Nice legs"" :) 

And Nathan's hair was so great! I heart that boy. *-*

B/H scenes were the best. Exactly why I liked this episode. The hugs and the concern! Hee.

B/P friends again? I think it's nice. ^^

Big relief when they won, to be honest. I totally didn't breathe during Lucas' shot. I was all negative thinking ""He's gonna miss"", but he didn't. I was glad. :D

Whitey rocks.

Chearleaders never been so effing awsome. <333333 When the doctor took Haley with him and the other called the stupid woman ""whore"" and ""bitch"". I had to stop the episode cuz I couldn't stop laughing. XD

And the grade's thing, about Brooke, was just... wow. Rachel's smart? Since when? *scratches head*

Worst part, broke my heart, was when N/H did the lil walk and she got hit by the car. I cried there, it was so shocking. When I got hit by a car I think I roled like that too, but not as fast and hard. =\ And when Nate ran to the car... gosh. I wanted to punch Dante myself. -_- 

So, best parts were when Brooke called Haley ""honey""; and Bevin's line ""I'm Rachel and I have red hair!"" - I couldn't stop laughing at the last one and first one was just way too adorable. :D


On another note, omg next week's promo is possibly the BEST EVER. I watched it like 10 times just to see Sophia. GOTHIC LOVE, OMFG. <333

And I can proudly say I'm in love with it. It's indeed an awsome show. It has everything to be it. The intrigue, the drama, the relationships, the humor, and the good looking people rule it. And the medical thing just makes me like it even more, because it can show us so many cases of diseases I never even heard about. And it's realistic and well done. I like that. I really do. :) 
If I had to choose a favourite character, I wouldn't know how. I love Meredith, I love Izzie, I love Cristina, George, Alex, Derek, Bailey, etc. I love Meredith/Derek, and their chemistry. Cristina/Burke is interesting too, it amuses me. George is adorable and funny and Alex is good looking and I like the humor he brings to the show (although what he apparently did in the season finale wasn't that funny). And Izzie, she's awsome! Hilarious, and I heart the way Kathering Heigl plays that character. The Izzie/George friendship is so great in many ways, that I squee when there's a scene with both of them alone, just talking. Meredith bugs me some times, but most of the times she's cool. And Ellen's way of talking is so funny, lol. Me and Mariana kept imitating her saying ""nothing"", coz of how she spells ""th"". Heh. And she's gorgeous. Guh. Oh, and McDreamy... meh, I like him in many scenes, but in others... not that much. And I have a strong opinion about Addison, for now. I know I only saw like 3 minutes of her but... that scene didn't actually show her prettyness all that much, you know? I just don't think it did. And Ellen showed to be better in it too. But it's just an opinion, coz I know how everyone loves Addison. Lol, anyway I'm just extremely excited to watch season 2 and to get to know more of these characters. I liked some patients too, the people that played them were wonderful. And the ex-girlfriend of the one who swallowed the keys was Ever Carradine! Aw, she's awsome. And there was also an actress who played one of the potential slayers in Buffy. Heh.

So, overall, I need that second season!! *iz ded* </lj-cut>




<lj-cut text=""And the last OTH episode..."">



One Tree Hill was okayyyy this week... I think the best of this episode was probably Whitey and his lovely speech <strike>(it got me crying)</strike> and, was that right? Could it? Oh, yes it was, a Naley kiss! ;D And of course, the best quote, by Haley to Rachel, ""I can't stand you!"". HEE *hearts Haley forever and ever and forever more* xD 
That promo really scared me, Daunte and his pipe and Nate's knee. Such a fine knee, btw. ^^ Anyway, Brooke annoyed me and I think the episode I downloaded cut the B/H scene I think it happened. So if it happened and anyone saw it, please tell me what was it about. *begs* 
Why did Brooke annoy me? She was a bitch to Peyton (yeah, ok, that was fun to watch) and she asked Lucas to go to the banquet with her. First of all: That's just unfair. She breaks up with him because she doesn't miss him anymore, and the guy gets to feel like crap while she goes screwing <strike>ugly Felix senior</strike> Nick around. And then she just feels lonely and suddenly misses him and tells him and he just accepts it? C'mon, that was stupid. 
I liked Peyton this episode, except when she said the real Derek was annoying as hell. He painted her room! He told her how to be strong! He saved her. If that's annoying, at least she should appreciate it. Which she did, so that's why I liked her. xD And she could walk alone again! Yay. :) 
Another thing, Paul was HOT. Whoes. O_O I'm getting used to the Dan/Karen relationship and I like it. And the Haley/Lucas/Karen scene was great coz it remembered us of good old times. And it looked like Haley was going to kiss Lucas' mouth too, ew. O__o And Mouth/Gigi! Aw!! Nice! =D
Eh, so the one thing I really didn't like was when Dan went to Daunte and <strike>his girlfriend</strike> Bear (btw, what kind of badass name is that? xD) and couldn't help Nathan. I was just plain disappointed. I surely also hope the Ravens win the game. Poor Whitey.
Although the next promo is SCARY. klajdakjdakadjw, DUDE!! I hope nothing bad happens to the baby, or I'll surely send a private plane with missiles to kill Schwanny and his house! *evil laugh* On the other hand, BALEY SCENES! YIPPEE! *dances* XD

Yeah, that's it for the fandom world today. I'll check on ya later

Saw this meme in <lj user=""ritinha"">'s journal, and I snagged it. Hah. x)

<u>The Process</u>
<b>Step One</b>
- Make a post (public, friendslocked, filtered...whatever you're comfortable with) to your LJ. The post should contain your list of 10 holiday wishes. The wishes can be anything at all, from simple and fun (""I'd love a Snape/Hermione icon that's just for me"") to medium (""I wish for _____ on DVD"") to really big (""All I want for Christmas is a new car/computer/house/TV."") The important thing is, make sure these wishes are things you really, truly want.

- If you wish for real possible things, make sure you include some sort of contact info in your post, whether it's your address or just your email address where Santa (or one of his elves) could get in touch with you.

- Also, make sure you post some version of these guidelines in your LJ, so that the holiday joy will spread.


<b>Step Two</b>
- Surf around your friendslist (or friendsfriends, or just random journals) to see who has posted their list. And now here's the important part:

- If you see a wish you can grant, and it's in your heart to do so, make someone's wish come true. Sometimes someone's trash is another's treasure, and if you have a leather jacket you don't want or a gift certificate you won't use--or even know where you could get someone's dream purebred Basset Hound for free--do it.

You needn't spend money on these wishes unless you want to. The point isn't to put people out; it's to provide everyone a chance to be someone else's holiday elf--to spread the joy. Gifts can be made anonymously or not--it's your call.

There are no rules with this project, no guarantees, and no strings attached. Just...wish and it might come true. Give and you might receive. And you'll have the joy of knowing you made someone's holiday special.


<u>My Christmas Wishlist</u>

Lucas: ARRRGHH, I'M GAY AND I'M ITCHY AND I'M THE NEW MICHAEL JACKSON!
Peyton: Whaaa??

Sorry, couldn't resist it. The cap looks hilarious. XD I loved this scene, though. Besides that Derek is spying on them like the psycho he is, of course. I mean, the LP relationship has been going up some points in my consideration lately. Heee.

Anyway, onto the whole episode review (and no, I don't have that many caps, so I won't make a comment using them :s).
In my opinion, I think it was a pretty good episode. I felt like it was a little rushed in the LPD scenes, but it was okay. Hilarie acted really nice and she makes a perfect scared Peyton. And Matt Barr was awsome, and he played his character awsome-ly. :p Very realistic indeed. Oh, and when Peyton walked in her house when her door is open, I was like ""Wow, he's already in there?"", but then as she started going through the house, I was more into it and scared and then all I remember is yelling ""ARGGHHH, CHAD!"" XD Haha, I'm evil. But really, I did. Lol.
What the hell is with Brooke? And the one night guy? She's like... season 1 Brooke or something. Except for the Baley scene. Which was fun, but one only? NoOoOo, me wants more Baley scenes. *pouts* And the guy being a teacher thing is not motivating me that much. Gah. And the HAND HOLDING?! WTF? She didn't even know him.
Lucas... meh, he was okay. I wanted to slap him now and then, though. But heeee!, I liked him when he and the real Derek throwed PSYCHO GUY out of the window. All those pictures in Peyton's room were SO FREAKY. adoiahjwdjnkajdikjad 
The real Derek is cute and looks... tight and not so caring. But we don't know, right? *shrugs* 
I hate Rachel. She wasn't so bitchy in some parts though, and I liked when she told Nathan she lied. ^^

NATHAN! OMG. HE MADE ME CRY!! =O The speech was so... ugh, love. :D I whispered 'bastard' at him in the beginning, but then I yelled ""WOOTS, NATE!"". Heh. And Joy, omfg!! Can she rule more? Can she? YES, SHE ALWAYS RULES MORE THAN I EXPECT. Not that I don't expect much, which I do, and that's why it's so impressive. And she's so pretty!! *sigh*
Sophia was pretty too. She's gorgeus. And I liked Hilarie's hair too, heeee! James looked totally fine, and... No Mouth again? Oh...
Deb annoyed me. She's such a junkie, I almost felt sorry for her. -_-
AND DAN! Dude, I was even liking him this season and... wasn't he suppose to be all good and stuff?? He congratulated Haley and then went to mock Nathan about it? Grrrr, if I were there I would hit him with a pipe. Someone should, nevertheless. 

I just read some major spoilers for around episode 7 or 8... and me likes it, haha. =D 

So overall, this was it. Cool. :)

"event","Hi. I just watched 4x02 of One Tree Hill.

<lj-cut text=""watch out, my comments and spoilers ahead"">


Well I didn't exactly *love* this episode, but it had some really great scenes. ^^
And now into the real episode commentary:


First thing I noticed: Wtf, Nathan slept on the bridge? How could he fall sleep there? *shakes head*
And the first scene of Lucas and Peyton kinda pissed me off. He's all ""give me your hand"" and then says he's gonna get Brooke back? I felt sorry for Peyton, although in the rest of the episode I felt even more sorry for Brooke. 
Poor Brooke. Peyton and Lucas planned that stuff for her birthday and in the end, when she doesn't show up, none of them even cares to just voicemail her or something, wishing her a happy birthday? =S Plus, Haley. Wasn't Brooke already 18 when she went to talk to Haley at the cafe? I was hoping that when Brooke was leaving she'd say something about it. :)
Ok, and because I *have* to mention it: that same scene of the cafe... Left it all kind of obvious. Last episode I said that the pregnancy thing was not clear when it came to knowing if either it was Brooke or Haley the pregnant one. And now, in this episode, I just said ""they are totally both pregnant, LOL."" 'Cause duhr, first Haley asks Brooke if last year she and Lucas ever talked about the possibility of a baby, and then Brooke asks her if she and Nathan ever talked about it too. 
=P Oh, and when Haley went to Karen's and she completely started babbling about being pregnant, LOL. It was such a fun.
Erm, what else... Deb! Omg! What is wrong with that woman?! She's possessed, lmao. 
oh, and about Skillz... meh, he showed up too many times in my opinion... I mean, I like him a lot, but I dunno if he really should be a regular... I think most people prefered when he was the Bevan boy. They're so funny together ^^
Where was Mouth? Me wants to see him! xD See, this is the problem. They had to try and fit all the main characters in the episode, but duh, of course they couldn't. So many. -_-
And urgh, too much Leyton. Didn't like it.
I thought Dan was pretty cool, though. I always wanted him to be with Karen, 'cause I believe he's actually nice. And the thing he made for Karen's baby was really sweet. :)
Btw, what is up with people mistaking Nathan with Cooper? Nathan's skinnier and taller and... prettier? =D?
 
Finally on the last character: Rachel. One word for her: Ew.
Daneel's voice annoys me! :x 
And even though I know Nathan will kick her (even if it's just mentally :p), it just sucks.


So, favourite scenes: I *loved* when Skillz called Peyton ""homewrecker"". It was really funny, hehe. AND when Lucas kept saying he did not cry like a school girl. Also cool when Deb called that woman a fatass. xD Joy looked totally cute in that scene, btw. =) 

P.s: I carry hate for Chad's hair lately. >.<

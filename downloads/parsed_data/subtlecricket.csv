"event","Today's my mom's birthday.  She's at the hairdresser's now, getting a new 'do in preparation for going out to lunch with me and a few friends, then to dinner at a fancy restaurant.  I bought some presents that I think are right on the mark, and my dad's supposed to get a cake.  It's supposed to be the best birthday she's had in a long time.

My aunt (her sister) called about an hour ago: their mother died last night.  Mom doesn't know.

Now, shit, I'm bawling my eyes out and I can barely form a coherent sentence -- she's my favorite and last surviving grandparent.  What I'm most stressed out about is my mom.  Her birthday from now on will be a sour event.  Her birthday today is completely and utterly demolished.  She's in a great mood today, which is actually rare for her.  Oh my god.  Everything suddenly seems so insignificant compared to this.

I thought of keeping up the charade....letting her have her birthday, then telling her....but that would be cruel, I guess, and I can't do it; I'm a wreck, myself.  It wouldn't work, wouldn't be fair to keep her from the truth.  Oh, shit.

I guess I'll just tell her myself that her sister called.  She'll see the state I'm in, and she'll know what happened without me having to tell her.  It's the best I can do.  Oh my God this is going to kill me."

[23:01] Bennu Iret: o.o
[23:03] Bennu Iret: I got it while fighting this big hairy monster over a peanut butter sandwich earlier today
[23:04] Bennu Iret: it was a glorious fight
[23:05] Bennu Iret: it had claws the size of kitchen knives and fangs sharp as needles and red eyes and horns
[23:05] Bennu Iret: and all I had was a spoon
[23:05] Jon: .......why am I not believing this?
[23:06] Bennu Iret: and the peanut butter sandwich lay between us on a little greek pedestal
[23:06] Bennu Iret: all innocent-like
[23:06] Jon: ....with little cupids floating above it?
[23:06] Bennu Iret: yes!
[23:06] Bennu Iret: so you saw it
[23:07] Bennu Iret: anyway, so the hairy monster lunges at me, but I blocked it with my spoon-spinner technique
[23:07] Bennu Iret: then I thwacked him over the head
[23:08] Bennu Iret: then he lashed out at me with those gleaming claws and broke the skin of my lip!
[23:08] Bennu Iret: so I spooned out his eyes
[23:08] Jon: Whereupon you used the super secret hakoden spoon tech and blasted him away right?
[23:08] Bennu Iret: of course
[23:08] Jon: that one that costs 400 mp?
[23:08] Bennu Iret: yes, that one
[23:09] Bennu Iret: then I took the peanut butter sandwich and ran away
[23:09] Bennu Iret: but the peanut butter was smooth, an I like the chunky stuff
[23:09] Bennu Iret: so I gave it to a stray dog and ate ramen instead
[23:10] Jon: haha

I'm also back from vacation.  It wasn't as great as I'd imagined it to be...but I got some quiet time and was able to finally realize what a journal is for.  Maybe now I'll be able to actually fill up a book before starting a new one.  Did some sailing, accompanied my brother in the little paddleboat, discovered that my little terrier (brought home from the pound) knows how to swim like a champ -- he jumped in the water and swam out toward the middle of the lake, where dad and Joe were sailing.  Thankfully the dog isn't a complete idiot, because he turned around halfway and came back to shore.

Can't say he doesn't get exercise.

Everyone should go read more F. Scott Fitzgerald.  Now.  And Harry Potter, while you're at it.  And watch Naruto -- and don't stop when it looks stupid at first.  [insert spoiler]  *sob*"

"event","<lj-cut text=""I'm just a bit pissed off.  Ranting is good."">I hate having my life being led by someone else.  Everything I do, my mother disapproves.  Then she disses my professors and the people who have gone before me -- though she's never been anywhere near the publishing business -- declares herself always right, and has a fit when I don't like her ideas.  I MUST do everything she says or I'll be penniless and homeless when I get out of college.  The trouble is, every single time she's made such suggestions, they've either been wrong or have landed me in depressing and humiliating positions.  I never wanted to work at Strawbridges, I begged not to go, but SHE almost literally pushed me into the customer service and stood outside while I filled out an application and took an interview.  You all know how wonderfully THAT turned out.  I've made phone calls and walked into offices because she told me to, and only got eye rolls and sarcastic voices in return.  That's not because the questions she TOLD me to ask are stupid ones that I knew the answer to before, oh no -- it's because I don't try hard enough.

She has a grand fit when I tell her to back off and let me live my own life.  I want to make a decision for once.  For God's sake, let go!  I'm 20 years old, but she won't believe it; she won't give me room to breathe, she still commands me as if I were five and didn't know any better than to do whatever mommy says.  I can't do one thing without her breathing down my neck, telling me I'm going about it all wrong or that my decisions are stupid or that I'm not good enough for anything.  I'm sick of listening to her complaining to my father about me, saying how worthless I am and how I'm always wrong and she's always right.  I feel like I have to get a prestigious job and pursue a career I don't even know is right for me not because I want to, but just to make her happy.  I have to get good grades and join every club there is and go above and beyond everything that anyone has ever done, just to make her happy.  I'm tired of making her happy.  She's never happy.  Since I got home I've been bending over backwards to do everything she wanted me to do, and still I'm worthless.  I don't want to have to prove myself to my own mother.  I don't have to.

What I really want is a job where I can feel appreciated.  Somewhere where my thoughts and abilities are welcomed and paid attention to and used for the betterment of the company and the people.  I want to be able to make a difference for other people, not just gain experience for myself by answering phones and carting coffee all day.  That's why I hated my last job -- I had to silently do what I was told and nothing more, and my opinions were nothing.  Just like at home.

I don't want to live in the corporate world.  I'm having serious doubts about this whole publishing business, because it's a desk job and wired around money and prestige and selling things and looking good.  But once I tell her an idea of mine, that ""I think I might want to go into publishing,"" she gets all gung-ho and shoves me in all directions on winding roads from which there is no return.  The keywords are ""I think.""  That means don't push me.  These things are fleeting, I've had 20 ideas in the past 3 months.

I'd rather work in a laundromat all my life than sit forever in a sunless cubicle, staring at blurring pages of text.  I don't want a life that revolves around deadlines and wasting paper and not talking to anyone except on lunch break.  I don't want to have to put on stockings every day and go to sleep every night with aching eyes and hands.  I want to be myself, always, even if it means I only make enough money to live.  Is that too much to ask?</lj-cut>"

"event","Aw man... Veronica invited me to the accounting society dinner tonight, though I have and will never have anything to do with accounting.&nbsp; But I got dressed, actually put on some makeup to look all snazzy, then went down to catch the shuttle.&nbsp; I thought I missed it, because I saw a shuttle pulling away.&nbsp; The next one wasn't for 2 hours.&nbsp; Katrina was standing nearby -- someone I barely talk to...ever... -- and she said she'd take me over.&nbsp; Then the shuttle pulled up, so I declined the ride.&nbsp; Still, goes to show how awesome people are.&nbsp; I should pay more attention.

I walked in with Mike, but ended up sitting with two older women, one of whom had her little daughter with her.&nbsp; So cute!&nbsp; We had dinner, then listened to a presentation.&nbsp; I swear...the presentation was on how to legally swindle the government and employees out of hundreds of thousands.&nbsp; The guy was Michael Keaton meets Jack Nicholson creepy, too.

Then there was a 50/50 raffle drawing, and guess what.&nbsp; Yes, I won.&nbsp; $53.&nbsp; I was...completely shocked and embarrassed.&nbsp; There was no way I deserved that money, after only buying tickets to support the society because I felt bad for eating the food for nothing.&nbsp; Technically, I wasn't even supposed to be there.&nbsp; So I gave it to the woman with the little kid, and she let me have back the money I paid for the raffle.

Still...afterward, I felt bad for being congratulated on winning, then when I told them I gave away the money, I felt bad for being told how nice I was.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; It was good.&nbsp; I think now, though, I definitely don't want to touch accounting with a 10-foot pole.&nbsp; They can have it."

"event","Hero is a guy with a problem.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure he's my age, maybe a couple years younger.&nbsp; Long story short, he runs his own roleplaying message board, and often asks me for help, but never accepts what I offer.&nbsp; He's a tyrant to his players.&nbsp; He sent me the link to a post he made that basically put down the players for doing anything other than paying attention to his site and making him happy.&nbsp; As soon as I began to tell him how harsh and unrealistic this was, he did the equivalent of sticking his tongue out at me, then blocked me.

Of course, this got on my nerves.&nbsp; I thought the community he was ""running"" needed to be informed, and I needed to let him know what I thought, so I replied to his message board flame with my own. Anyone who has roleplayed via messageboard will know what I'm talking about:

<lj-cut text=""Thank the gods I saved it, because it amused me to no end."">Ok, you BLOCKED me before you gave me a chance to finish, so I'll finish here.

Your site is inactive because nobody likes being told what to do. Nobody likes being yelled at, nobody likes being argued with, nobody likes being told that they're wrong. I see the same patterns here that I saw when we roleplayed over IM oh so long ago, and they're the same patterns I saw in your first roleplaying site. In both situations, I couldn't stand roleplaying in the environment, and therefore quit. I don't doubt that at least some of your players, if not most, feel the same way.

You rule with an iron fist. This is not a democracy, no matter how much you say it is or how much you believe you're trying. When I RPed with you on IM, you wouldn't let me play out my own ideas because they would rub the wrong way against your own ideas, which were set in stone and unable to be moved. I was forced to go along with whatever you had planned, forgetting whatever plotlines I had in mind because they didn't fit exactly with your idea of the world we were playing in or the plotline your character was going through. That was what drove me insane.

Roleplaying is a joint effort. NOTHING is set in stone. Everyone's idea is as relevant as the next, whether you like it or not. If someone's idea conflicts with yours, consider bending the rules to accomodate other people's points of view instead of forcing them to see things your way.

The same thing happened in the first roleplaying forum. Characters were given certain statuses and abilities which were appropriately higher according to administrative status on the site. Those who weren't desperate enough to suck up to you ended up getting mutilated, humiliated, and killed, no matter what kind of roleplaying effort they put forward. Those who were on your good side were the ""heroes"" and were effectively untouchable when it came to combat. The moderation was skewed in this way, and the whole site was corrupted and certainly not fun. Then being continually IMed to post and to contribute and to voluntarily get my character killed because she's a ""bad guy"" and she should die so the ""good guys"" can win. All the time.

This isn't a reenactment of some book you wrote. This is roleplaying. JOINT writing of a story. The good guys don't win all the time. The ""bad"" characters add depth to your plots and should be treated as characters, not as NPC demons. The world that you yourself create is merely a skeleton. Let other people contribute to it without needing to edit it to your specifications or trash it altogether because it ""doesn't fit."" If you want a website like this to work, you have to give the power to the players and back off. Arguing with everyone about everything they suggest is only pushing you backward.

I haven't analyzed what goes on in this website because everything I've seen thus far has pointed to the same things. If you want people to have fun on the site, allow them to create what they want to see and tweak what they don't like. If you want them to stick around and post often, don't butcher them for every bunny and don't shut them down for disagreeing with you. If you want people to be nice to you, BE NICE TO THEM.

Frankly, Hero, you are NOT a born leader. You can't handle the pressure, you can't handle the people. Yes, it's fun to have power, but when you have it you're corrupted. You abuse it, whether you realize this or not. Nobody else shares your passion for YOUR site. Of course you love this site, you created it. Other people have other things on their minds: this is not a priority for them. To put them down for having lives just shows your own inability to understand anyone's point of view other than your own.

As a final note, I would like to address the subject of religion. I am a spiritual person, following a path of selected parts of Buddhism and Wicca. I am not Christian, though I was raised as one. I care about all people and respect their ideas, no matter if they follow Judaism or Satanism. I, however, do not appreciate being bombarded with religious values and strangled into your beliefs. I also see these seeping into your roleplaying, as well, especially when it's your righteous character against one who is more pagan. If you plan to ignore my pleas and to continue on with your roleplaying, and though I respect your ideas and beliefs fully, I ask that you keep your religion to yourself. This is not a subject which should make any kind of appearance within the game whatsoever, unless it is an in-game religion. This includes all types of OOC prejudices.

Please step down, and do not pursue to lead anything like this again until you're ready to be a team player. Don't call me again to look at your work just so you can argue with me about it. Don't ask for my help again. I'm tired of pulling my hair out because you refuse to listen to a word I say, and because you only hear what you want to hear. Nobody's out to get you, and nobody's against you personally. You start the fights that erupt around you. It's as simple as that.

A good leader doesn't have to yell at his players. A good leader can bring something desirable to every player. A good leader can attract players and keep them without holding them in shackles. Step down, learn something, and, for once, FOLLOW.

Just the fact that you blocked me when I said something against you proves my point. Think about that.</lj-cut>

You'd think someone would at least think about it when someone else says this about them.&nbsp; Oh, but Hero's too smart for that!&nbsp; I went back to the website and found that I couldn't access anything - it seems he blocked my IP address or something.&nbsp; I don't doubt he deleted my post, as well, if he didn't take down the entire site.&nbsp; Then he un-blocks me on messenger and sends me IMs on both AIM and MSN:

Hero Godsend: ...I blocked you because I knew you were going to spout some bs that was full of lies and turned me into some sort of evil villain.
Bennu Iret: I'm tired of arguing
Bennu Iret: but I'm also tired of watching you blame other people for your own problems
Hero Godsend: You're stupid. I don't have problems, its the other people. ESPECIALLY You
Hero Godsend signed off at 1:51:30 PM. 

herogodsend@hotmail.com says:
I hate people who are so fucking full of themselves they can't see the truth right in front of them, and that's what you are!
Phoenix says:
ok calm down
  
  The following message could not be delivered to all recipients:
ok calm down

Yep. He blocked me. Again. I hope it's for good this time, and I hope he took down that offensive website of his. As you might tell, he was really starting to get on my nerves. Just a bit. And anyone who knows me knows that is quite hard to do.

I post all this here to preserve the lovely memory of Hero, and I leave it public so others may not repeat his mistakes. He doesn't know of my journal, so it's safe from flaming.

By the way -- it's snowing outside.  A lot.  This is insane."

I get stressed and I worry myself sick much too easily, I can't handle having a boulder just dropped on my back like this.

The fact that today's my 20th birthday doesn't exactly make the day look any brighter.&nbsp; I need to start taking responsibility for things and I need to stop procrastinating.&nbsp; I can't be a little kid anymore, but when I look at these so-called ""successful"" people, I just cringe.&nbsp; I don't want to be successful, I want to be happy.&nbsp; But, it seems, there's no degree or application that offers anything of the sort.&nbsp; Those that do are fading away so rapidly that by the time I'm qualified for them they'll be extinct.&nbsp; I'd imagine 10 years from now the majority of people will be working in cubicles, thinking that money=happiness.&nbsp; It's that train of thought that is often at the root of mental illnesses and suicides.

Is it a crime that I don't know what I want?&nbsp; Everything's corrupted, unless you work for nothing.&nbsp; Maybe....maybe there is a volunteer position for me for the summer.&nbsp; If I stay at it, perhaps I can at least break into a field that's not obsessed with subliminal messages and creating fads and effectively robbing people -- both customers and employees -- for its own benefit.&nbsp; I want to sell my services to people who need them, not the latest fashions to people who could certainly do without.

I can write, and I can edit.&nbsp; I love nature and wildlife and literature and art and music and creativity and children.&nbsp; I can do whatever I want to do, but I must want to do it in order to do it well.&nbsp; Money is not a motivator: the action is all there is.&nbsp; I want to make a difference.&nbsp; I want to start over.&nbsp; I need luck.

Right now there's a music war going on between me and my roommate.&nbsp; Those same 4 songs from Destiny's Child vs PotF, Queensryche, Smashing Pumpkins, Adema, Blind Guardian, Metallica, Story of the Year, among others.&nbsp; But she's singing along, so it's a tougher battle than it would otherwise be.&nbsp; Wish me luck, my comrades!"

"event","aahh, I have to learn to take public criticism.&nbsp; My critical writing prof told the class what problems there were with my paper and that I could do it over for a better grade.&nbsp; It's only a B-, but that's the lowest grade he ever gives.&nbsp; But yah....I know that it would probably be a good thing to suck it up and not be bothered by people publicly ripping apart my work.&nbsp; It's good for the ego.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I have a lot of that when it comes to written stuff.

So then I got a PM from Vlad saying that Fox really did completely screw over my thread when she took over the moderation.&nbsp; I thought there was something childish and stupid going on with that.&nbsp; I can't take back anything about that thread, which makes no sense whatsoever at the moment.&nbsp; Dammit.&nbsp; Then I had to choose between Paul and Sias for moderation of a new thread, in which, with Vlad's help, we'll try to salvage what we can of the original plot.&nbsp; I chose Sias because she was absolutely dying to moderate it, but I secretly really think Paul will do a much better job.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; At least this time we'll keep in contact with Vlad to make sure nothing like this happens again.

"event","Destiny's Child!

Destiny's Child is the demon which has been plaguing me in my waking hours as well as my nightmares..&nbsp; It is the worst of horrors, the ghoulish reality of our world that stupidity rules the planet.&nbsp; My brother could write better backing music, and the lyrics are so horribly stupid and simple and meaningless that they generate no thought above the 'duh' factor.&nbsp; Let's not forget that they're all about sex and/or 'pleasing your man.'&nbsp; Children and teens should not listen to this because it's part of the reason the female image is so screwed up.&nbsp; Adults shouldn't listen to it because it kills brain cells.&nbsp; I'm not sorry to any of you who actually like Destiny's Child..&nbsp; It's completely unacceptable.

One should not listen to said music with headphones on that can be heard clearly on the other side of the room.&nbsp; One also should not sit with your nose almost touching the computer screen.&nbsp; One should also know that when you accidentally kick the power button on the computer, the computer will go off.&nbsp; This is not an excuse to call several people and yell at them to come and fix a computer you have unintentionally turned off.&nbsp; Especially when your roommate is watching you and trying not to laugh.

I also must figure out how to rearrange the mess of power strips, extension cords, and clustered appliances/tv/computer before a fire breaks out.&nbsp; That's the reason I moved my fridge in the first place.

I simply cannot handle stupid people.&nbsp; Stupid people annoy me to no end.

BTW, these are the only problems I have with my roommate.&nbsp; She's quite nice and understanding, and I certainly don't bitch to her about this trivial stuff.&nbsp; But yanno, some people you just can't live with...."

So I hiked over to the student center, since the food court there isn't supposed to close until 10 pm and usually has some good wraps.&nbsp; I got there to see that all they had left were 4 slices of plain pizza.&nbsp; I mean, that's ALL they had left.&nbsp; Not even a danish or a bagel or anything.&nbsp; After I'd bought a slice, the food court closed.&nbsp; At 8 pm.

"event","&lt;Gus&gt; I have a problem with vegetables in general &nbsp;
&lt;me&gt; o.o
&lt;me&gt; nooooo
&lt;me&gt; I'm practically a vegetarian &nbsp;
&lt;me&gt; except not
&lt;me&gt; I absolutely can't eat a meal that has no fruit or vegetables
&lt;Gus&gt; so we finally find out what makes us not a paradox that would make worlds collide!
&lt;me&gt; ...what?
&lt;me&gt; @.@
&lt;Gus&gt; if we were really so much alike to the point that we would be almost the same person but of a different gender, it would defy the universal law that everyone is unique, and the world would collapse in an anti-bigbang!!!!
&lt;Gus&gt; o.o
&nbsp;&lt;me&gt; o.o
&nbsp;&lt;me&gt; this is true!
&lt;me&gt; and so
&lt;me&gt; we should be very thankful that we aren't exactly the same
&lt;me&gt; which is true anyway, because I grew up speaking a different language&nbsp; :D
&lt;Gus&gt; the universe doesn't care about language! it cares about vegetables!!!

Mwaha.&nbsp; What is it with me and my fascination with foreign boys? o.O;&nbsp; It is weird, though, because besides the language thing and the vegetable thing, Gus and I are almost identical in personality and some history.&nbsp; It's very, very freaky.

So.&nbsp; Lazed around til 3:30, had lunch, had ethics, had critical writing, was pretty good.&nbsp; Went to the open mic at the campus Starbuck's, was considered a member of Essence, found out the poems I sent weren't late for the deadline.&nbsp; I kinda wanted to play the violin, except...I didn't have my violin. :(&nbsp; This was sad.&nbsp; Quite sad.&nbsp; But everyone else was good.&nbsp; *claps*"

"event","crap.&nbsp; I just ruined my mood by replaying everything I said an did over the weekend, and realizing how snotty and stuck-up I am.

At the party:
- being offered a drink - ""No, I don't want that!""&nbsp; while looking away and shooing like an idiot.&nbsp; Kevin was just trying to be nice.

- when asked why I came if I wasn't drinking - ""I didn't have anything better to do, so I'm here.""&nbsp; That was killer, absolutely uncalled-for, and I didn't realize it til now.&nbsp; Ow.

I have no idea what to do when someone makes a hand motion toward me.&nbsp; Do they want a handshake?&nbsp; A hug?&nbsp; A high-five?&nbsp; One of those weird secret handshake things?&nbsp; I don't know!&nbsp; Yes, I'm a nerd.&nbsp; You have to tell me these things.

At least I supported Kevin when he was trying to remain sober.&nbsp; Alas, it wasn't enough.

I also laughed much more than is normal.&nbsp; Probably nerves.

Today:

Veronica thanked me for coming with her to play in the snow, and all I said was ""you're welcome"" as if I was doing her a favor, instead of ""my pleasure"" or something like that.&nbsp; Why did she thank me?&nbsp; probably because I come off as stuck-up.&nbsp; yep.

Mike asked me why I didn't drink last night, and I guess there was something mean in my voice because he said I was being hostile.&nbsp; Probably joking, but still.

So yah, I need to learn to cool it and think, and NOT about myself.&nbsp; I guess I am stuck-up and snotty sometimes.&nbsp; I must must must learn to communicate without the attitude.&nbsp; Damn this is embarrassing.&nbsp; I will learn!&nbsp; Hopefully everyone doesn't get sick of me before I get enough practice in being considerate.&nbsp; In fact, ever since I was little I felt the need to show off in front of other people, thinking that would make people like me.&nbsp; Omg, that's my problem.&nbsp; I'm a snotty bitch.&nbsp; Someone shoot me.&nbsp; Why is this only occurring to me now?&nbsp; Damn.

Is there a class on this?"

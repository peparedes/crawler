"event","yearly update! back in montreal, switched into comp engineering (tough business). woke up early this morning after a lonely night: don't know what's going on with me. been very down, and struck out with anyone and everyone, starting with my cousin's best friend from LA. i think i should just be abstinent: i also think something is wrong with me, beginning with the feeling of something bad growing inside. after 5 or 6 beers i began talking to my roommate's girlfriend about kristen. it's something i don't often talk about, but has been on my mind on and off intermittently, along with the idea that something is wrong with me, and hence the lack of contact. i had a dream last night that vicki was with someone, and i'm not sure why this bothered me so much: i'm sure we've both been with people since we broke up. every time i meet a girl, i slowly freeze up, ruining any chance of mutual interest. in any case, this update need not be entirely depressing.

i'm doing well in classes, with the exception of ODE, in which i am struggling to catch up from having had a bad, bad teacher, and having switched into a better, albeit crowded class. i spent a long time in the math help lab this week, and anticipate doing so regularly the way the course is going right now.

in any case, i'm awake, i'm alone, and i have a feeling it's going to last."

"event","ive been thinking about amy a lot in the last couple of days. you may say, ""gee, big freakin' surprise."" well, i say, screw you, i don't care. she can never get rid of me, i'll love her until the day i die, regardless. everything reminds me of her, incubus (artist) and this song by yellowcard. we're patching things up, but even if we get back to where we were, i still don't have what i want, amy. i have my best friend, and sometimes that doesn't feel like enough. i wrote a part of a poem, here:

They're all screaming for action
On the concrete street down below
All writhing in a fluid movement
Gray shining patches still appear

They're all teeming with inspiration
As the street preacher sells his wares
Absorbing images of better lives
And better neighborhoods long since past

Cold sidewalks loom in the future
As an icy bitter wind careens through an alley
Staggering a waking wandering drifter
All for what.

it's called ""All For What."" i want a girl, i really just want amy, but we always want what we can't have, i think i'm a good example of this in many instances. what happened to christina disturbs me greatly, but i won't talk about that here. she needs help that i can't give her. i've been goin' to a lot of parties, another one tonight, feels as though i've been messed up for the last month straight, and that's pretty much the truth. Finished a new layout for my site (ubernooder.com) and i think it looks good. incoming shit, college shit, hate it, need my license, hopefully within two weeks. talk to you later

"event","yo, been baked every day this week, took some concerta yesterday and today, good shit. at the same time i HAVE been completing my homework. i did all of it! i had to serve a detention today, stupid rorth. i should be able to smoke, it's my body and i have the right to kill myself, school property or not. talking to gweny, she formed a relationship with a guy named adam today, so they're goin out. in a way im jealous of adam, even though ive never actually seen gwen face to face. just an old crush, i've probably mentioned it since i started talking to gwen again. Machine-Gutz payed $8 for my DA subscription, so look at it damnit! And i designed a new intro to my site (ubernooder.com), looks good. no new poetry really, just some stuff ive been messing around with, like:

is this how you want to end it
with a blank line and the world gone black
frightened and alone
crying for kindness

screaming to the night for forgiveness
whispering prayers
searching for the solace
that they wouldn't give you

sing with the choir
and follow your path
until you find an unsettling end
with no place to turn around and start again

or:

breaking down doors in my mind
smashing to pieces left with wooden fragments
breaking through myths to find
the world all alone faded to black

or:

your silence assures me that i am alone in life
wandering the roads black and baren as a cloudy night
alone again maybe at last the dull light above shines harshly
people walking waiting talking sadness fills me once more

for the last time it happens i will cry out
loud enough to shake the earth
and old rotted trees will collapse
with the rage of nature upon us

you can see this is all rather depressing poetry, im not feeling overwhelmingly sad any more, although i do feel sort of chaotic, out of it, like my life isnt in order. i need to pick a list of colleges. it feels like i need to do a lot, but im just working up to a panic attack ;]. I wish a girl i wanted to date noticed, acknowledged, and returned feelings, it's been too long.

*Two Minutes Later*

Gwen's inviting Adam over to spend the night tonight, it bothers me, i dont think i have the right to be angry, but i cant control what i feel

*10 minutes later*

I want to say something, but it would be stupid at this point to be like, ""oh, gwen, yah, i know ive never met you, but im envious of adam,"" that's rediculous, proposteous, INEXPLICABLE, GET ME OUTA HERE. nah, i dunno, i think i ""yearn"" for a longer healthy relationship with a girl, and seeing girls find guys that arent me pisses me off, damnit. i'll probably end up ranting again in a couple minutes. she's talking to him right now...am i tired? damn this concerta, damn it to hell man! im waiting for her to tell me what's happening with adam...i've come to the conclusion just now that the reason i hate the dating process when im not with a girl (and sometimes when i am) is because of the lack of control you have over the situation. i feel rather helpless. gwen just tried sayin goodnight and leaving before and explanation was given. she says she's going to bed, and not to bed with adam, which oddly makes me feel better. whatever. she's leaving, so i guess i can stop ranting again"

The more i look at gwen's lj the more i want to IM her, but i dont have the balls right now. not even to say ""hi"". :\. a bit past midnight, i really should just say hi. i dont have anything to put in my info...i don't want a quote, that can be so pretensious, people wont get it anyways, all my good quotes come from irc. more about boxing, i box with my dad, it isnt a new thing, but now that im back into training (bag wa) boxing once a week really helps. my nose and lip still kinda hurt, but it was great, i really enjoyed it. i was almost committed to a mental institution because i was deported from reality finally for a while. im home, so dont worry, and i was never a danger to myself or others, im not like that. me and mandla used to spar some, he liked it, i didnt want to push him because of the heart thing, so it was always minor, dan was more like me, just staying away from it unless necessary. yah, so im blazed, but the adderall is still with me, bad josh bad, whatever. gwen is an old crush, lol, it's strange how this stuff stays with you..she probably wont seem the same, i remember her a certain way now. ok, enough talking again, later"

"event","england was great, i had a lot of fun. no hook ups, but it's becoming less and less important it seems, im less and less interested in the girls around here, at least in the way of relationships. hooking up, that's different, in the words of a wise man, who cares! yah, i got sick when i came home, bronchitis, didnt go to much school, im working on fixing that. this whole thing with amy, oh wait, amy, yes. well, everyone knows about how i feel about amy, or they should by now: I Love Amy. Ok? Well, i guess i went too far one too many times, because she told me we can no longer talk, she's cutting her losses, or so she says. not to sound bitchy, but that cut deep, very deep. the more i think about it the more i realize what i shouldnt have done, and what i feel she shouldnt have done, let's just say it wasnt good timing, period. Broke down, went nuts, didnt go to school yesterday, feeling better now, got blazed earlier, have my pills, it's good, oh, and the homework isnt SO bad, only just above impossible. i'm reading gwen's LJ, i havent talked to gwen herself in, years now, but im going through her LJ to see what's changed, lived so close for so long and never even seen her. im less depressed after boxing, good to get out some agression, even if you do get hit in the head..:D heh. just thinking about what's happened, so i can post it here in this long ass post..uhh, mandla's memorial was a while ago now, no comment on that. Took that IQ thing over the tv thing earlier, it was stupid. i hate commercials, the brits dont have those on most channels :|. Let's list off my wants:

1) Amy to forgive and forget
2) a girlfriend, that, i actually want to date...
3) Finish my driving times (that's my own damn fault)
4) Oh, and a permanent vacation, i need one of those soon...

Any requests? Pieces of advice? Career help? Drop me a line, i'll end with the rhyme set i was writing:

lamentation in the form of water down my cheeks
worn down now for what feels like weeks
going on months streaming into years
im followed everywhere by a cloud filled with tears

rejected in vehement turned down the wrong path
subject to subject you'll soon taste my wrath
a seventh of deadly sin delivered to your door
in a carepackage wrapped with blood, sweat, and tears from the store

every person has a thousand faces
and shows but one to you
for every face there are a hundred cases
you are very lucky to see but two

how much can you hate you
more than you could hate any other
because who knows you better than you it's true
doesnt mean you wouldnt like to take them down one after another

my life is a lie so today i die
alone and hateful at this place
i sit here and cry wishing only to fly
escape this world and float to space

look at me, eyes made of glass
reflecting back the torment of years passed
while tacit questions race across open air
they only emphasize my horrible dispair"

"event","been a looooooooong time since i posted something. what's happened, let's see, time's passed, vacation is here. the guys are chillin here, only owen and alex, talking to zoe online, tleling her about my journal here. i dunno, as of late, like the past two months, ive been extra, well, horny. in need of a lady friend. it's slowed down since the summer, a lot. i need ass, from somewhere, i was even thinking about making a deal with daria (a freshman) cuz she was complaining about ass, but in the end i decided that maybe, but she would have to suggest it, I WILL NOT STOOP SO LOW :D! worked on the site, made a new image that im very proud of (http://www.ubernooder.com/images/p/moonlightserene.jpg), i really like it. I got amy mad at me, really mad, because i was a dick, and i was a dick because i was really angry, and i was really angry BECAUSE: my sister went through my shit, found a bag of weed, gave it to my mom. that's the short story, there are other parts to it that make it more angering. i moved into my dad's, for real, ive been here for a few days now, i really like it. very easy going, like it's always been with my dad, which is very different from the constantly moving and straining at my mom's, she's going nuts i tell ya. the guys are playing soul caliber 2 in the next room, great game, addicting, and im just thinking about ass (finding porn too!). i hope to get some on tuesday, with the coming of alice, but that has yet to be figured out. so, if it happens, i hope to get some, *sigh*, sad, so very sad. over the summer it was like, *walk outside, look at girls, flirt, fuck around, repeat*. DAMN YOU HIGHSCHOOL. my classes are far more challenging this trimester, but more interesting, im taking java so i can PROGRAMAMAMAM. hmm, so who do i LIKE right now? i cant really define any single person, i look at every girl with the idea in mind, saying, would this be who i want to DATE, be with, for a longer period of time. that's right, actually form a meaningful relationship with, nuts right? cant single out any one as of yet, besides amy of course. i still look at jerilynn with the utmost lust, cant help it no matter how many times i say to myself, dont think about her like that, just stop looking at her, just STOP THINKING ABOUT HER DURING CLASS. im getting better at it, but it's from such a long time ago, it just sticks with you. like that guy who you see during the reunion who goes after the chick who turned him down in highschool, it really sticks with you! i dunno, i always try to impress her with my art, or my poetry, or something, by saying, look at this for me? as if she's doing me this favor, by looking at my crappy art, which i guess she is. i dunno, one day i want her to say, wow, that's amazing, please, take me now! ahh well, guess that isnt going to happen. it's all about the ladies these days, cant get it out of my head, it's stuck there. anywho, this journal entry is long enough for one night, maybe someone will read this and thnk im fuckin nuts, later.

My dad's married again, im moving into his new house (his wife's house) in a couple weeks now. it weirds me out, i have a new step brother, who's autistic and sometimes hard to deal with. life's a bit demanding, i have to finish writing this paper tonight, write up my latin play, do an application for NHS (national honors society), study for math and latin. my mom's crazy, and going crazier, back to how she was before, neurotic and paranoid. i find myself not being able to sleep a lot, i dont sleep during the week or the weekends, not even during school. i created a new site, http://www.ubernooder.com, and im pleased with both the art and the poetry, not the mention the neat flash intro i made last night and the template i made before that. my old hard drive died, so this is a new one, with my programs put on it, missing stuff like my book marks, but what are ya gonna do? i brought over my desktop from my old house (havent moved out yet as i mentioned earlier), and i got some programs and files off it, it's sort of the same, just 4 months older or so, since i havent lived there in about 4 months, which is sort of depressing, but just like everything else, you get used to it. im so tired of moving, and so i refused to help paint my new room or move stuff into it when it's even ready to do that, im not going through compromise, my way or i wont live there. i dont have the same flexibility with my mom, but since i just steal her car when she's not around, smoke when she's not around (and when she is around actually), and she cant do shit about it, i still feel like im on top of the situation. without sleep it's slowly going downhill, harder to keep organized thought and maintain order generally, and listening to this music from 4 months ago makes me feel remaniscent of a simpler and sadder time. i feel as though i havent been a child for a long time, i feel as though my childhood ended early, mostly because i see a child in my mother still, and her whacked out patterns, not mention my sister, who is still pampered by my mom incessantly. it's all becoming too much, im moving out soon, out of here, and out of amherst, i'll be gone at the end of next year, and im not coming back except to visit, i will never live in amherst again, not for a summer, not for a month, never again. finished my paper just now, took me a long time, not truly thinking about it, listening to crystal meth, good stuff. when i get hte money im gonna buy some shrooms, and have a shrooming experience in my basement. im also going to try coke at some point, yes you heard me, i have the desire to try it. my friend used to deal coke in NYC, raised about 60 grand which he still fuckin has, and he's only 20, not bad right? i wont ask him, i have a dozen other friends who deal. in any case, im gonna go print that paper, and start on the next one, later

POEM

beauty no words can be put to
like a mountain who's height reaches to the brink of all
higher larger faster to the edge the limit of a dismal infinity
just beyond my reach

do me a favor and tell me im awful
dont let my hope grab hold and pull
it is worse to fail that close

a sacrifice of innocence
of blood's right through and through
the tail of a tragedy

in just one day says Greece
for life says Me
but we dont cry

"event","my weekend: saturday, driving at 9:30 with susan, finished at 11:30, i waited until like 5 minutes before she had to leave to kiss her, but we did play strip poker for a while before that ;], only to undies though, which is fine or i probably would have gotten naked a couple times :D, she's got a nice bod. anywho, then i went to dan's, played dnd, talked to anika (who, btw, was high when i called her back and masturbated TWICE while i talked to her, not bad, but interesting), i miss anika, i was gonna see her next weekend but it looks as though im not gonna make it up to boston, but sam (my man from NYC back in brown), is coming to amherst to visit amherst college, so i'll meet up with him definitely :]. sunday i got back, chilled for a LONG time, put off my homework, did it minus a journal entry (i need to do my time sheets, SOMEONE REMIND ME) :D, i havent done any art for a while, i wrote a poem, and im working on another, that im adding two lines to ad a time over a period of half a week spacing each, it's weird, but i like the seperate pieces so far (only 8 lines :D). anywho, im leaving, peace out

"event","11:30 PM, 23;30 EST to all you euros. no one i really want to talk to is up, i didnt do my latin, i blew it off as usual, but i did my math and my internship shtuff, so i figure it's ok, but i have other stuff to do before the week is at a close, so much. on top of the other people im supposed to see this weekend, dan's b-day party is this saturday, can i fit in the guys, alice, susan, and vanessa? i really hate to say it, but the only one i havent made any sort of planning with is vanessa,except, i sorta said saturday, so, im not sure. here's how it looks: friday, get off internship, chill until guitar, go to guitar, go to alice's, chill until later that night, go home. saturday, get up at 9, go driving at 9:30, finish driving at 11:30, susan come's over, susan leaves at around 4, i go to town with nessa, leave town around 6, go to dan's for party. sunday, do my homework, maybe see vanessa again. how's that sound? sounds damn good to me. oh, and i think i fractured (probably hairline or nothing) one of my knuckles, again, this time it's the index finger of the same hand, fuck. i got so mad, only my family could do that to me, make me feel liek shit and then kick me around in the dirt, i managed to punch this thing wrong because it was dark, it was rounded, i hit the edge, it cut me, so i guess i punched hard enough, but i think i caused seperation there or something, nurse said if it hurts in a couple days from now (since it happened saturday), to get it x-rayed. not pleasing, i cant stand my mom, she goes on as if nothing happened, she's really selfish and completely unaware of my feelings, and i have no way of conveying that in a way she would fully understand, and be able to acknowledge, she has no guilt, no shame, no respect. i figure i'll off her eventually, her ass isnt getting any help from me, neither is my dad to be honest. shit, where were you guys when i was a kid huh? dad, you worked all day and all night. mom, you were too busy to take care of me. my real family did that job for you, my brother and my sister (singular, the other ones werent around but they're just as important), who saved me as much as she killed me, micol. stef saved me this weekend, he took me out of the house on saturday after i got mad, couldnt stand it, hurt myself, thought once more of suicide, the last time i let it happen, i swear to god before i think of dying she's going to die, i wont let her get to me, none of them, never again. mom, you barely knew my name until the others left, there was no time for me, deny all you want but now that im the only one here, im the only one you cant put on hold, like you did to the rest, except for your baby micol. i want nothing to do with you, and when i get that car im leaving, and im not turning back
i'll enroll myself in another school system in another state, and i'll live in a halfway house until i get a good enough job, anything to leave my parents. now im not saying it couldnt be worse: by all means it could be worse, but no one said im living in this rich little fairytale, as though everyone from amherst has all this money, my mom came back to this country with nothing, my dad came to this country with nothing, they built up their lives, and for that they deserve what they have, nice houses and cars, nothing too expensive now, and of course my dad's nice house is his wife's, but that's the way it goes. on the OTHER hand my mom does NOT deserve a cruise when she cant pay for my sister to go to college. she spends money that could be used for us (and im not trying to sound selfish here, but that's what happens when you have 5 kids, you pay for their needs), and that's BULLSHIT. i went to brown this summer to take courses, and she's saying, ""i payed for you to go to brown, why dont i get a vacation"", to start i got a scholarship for more than half, then dad paid for half of what was left, and then it wasnt a vacation to go to brown, it was courses, i was working, that dumb bitch, she is not deserving of these little perks, the i work 2 full time jobs bullshit wont fly either, i work school, internship, drivers ed, and real job (which im working on), on top of other extracurricular activities like guitar, anime club, fbla. and i dont work hard? my mother is a fucking martyr and i'd love to send her into martyrdom someday. anyways, she angers me and im still not really talking to her, since she is a bad person in my book, and now i need some sleep. the time is 11:50, do you know where you're children are? peace

"event","im home sick from school, today on this 10th of september *sigh*. i need to go back tomorrow but remembering what is wont make it easy. no, im not talking about september 11th, the world trade centers,it's been a couple years and ive had sufficient time to get over that, plus it wasnt personal, i was afraid for my sisters and they're fine. havent you been reading the journal!? if you had, and had been looking at my poetry and art, really keeping up with me, you'd realize it's been 3 months since Dan died. 3 whole months, that's not a whole lot, that's 3 months ago, you can remember 3 months ago perfectly, cant you? i dont really remember the day before it, i barely remember the day after it, but i sure remember that day. ive just heard from nick (who's now in college, that's depressing, he's always been my backup on so many things, great guy), that lee has put someone who didnt even KNOW Dan in charge of his commemoration page in the year-book. i agree with nick in saying that's REDICULOUS, and that we should and will talk to lee about this. but im sick today, so nothing i can do, but like i said, i need to go back tomorrow. lee doesnt even know me (except i used to pop in on year-book meetings during latin because i was attempting to get class hall-wanderer, i was at the top of my game, skipping 20-30 minutes of an hour period every period is pretty damned good right? no longer, i sit through every period, i dont even take bathroom breaks yet :D). anyways, im going to find him, and i havent talked to tony yet either. more on tony, tony bond was a teacher of mine 1st or 2nd trimester of last year, i think 2nd, but im not quite sure. he taught computer maintenence and repair and networking, i took computer maintenence, i was going to take networking this year but im keeping my study hall instead, i dont feel like going through the trouble, but i do really need to talk to tony. anyways, his daughter is in my grade, and i think she thinks im weird because i spent a lot of time with her DAD last year. i visited tony during my hall wanderings as well, and we talked about a lot of stuff. i was trying to hack the school computers, and i was getting close, i figured out all this stuff about using runas commands from the desktop to grab local administrative access, but it doesnt really help you because a) it's only one computer, and b) if the administrative password is set you cant really do much. anywho, he was interested in what i was doing, so we talked a lot, but not just about computing. about our lives, what we were going for, stuff like that. when dan died i spent a lot of time in tony's room talking to him, he helped me through a lot, i think he was just as distraught as i was. anyways, im gonna give him an email today and ask what his classes look like and when i can drop in, because ive been trying after school a bit. thinking about that makes me cry, it's just too much, so i'll ttyl

"event","here's today's schedule: woke up at 7:25 AM, rushed to get dressed and to get to school (no time for shower). went to school, turned in not fully done math homework (apparently no one finished it), it was just too time consuming, so many people dropped it. i did on the other hand manage to complete my latin. tonight was the same thing, but im getting to that. B period i didnt do shit, did a couple phys-ed tests to see if i can lift weights or something, luckily i still can :D, then we walked track, and during this walking i walked with josh (that's right, im friends with another kid named josh in my math class who've ive known for a while), and he rolled me a ciggy for lunch with his rolling machine :]. went to latin, have to take 4th lunch on mondays instead of 3rd because of schedule glitch, stupid mr smith, i mean damnit, the latest lunch is still at only 11:30 AM, very early, but i have a schedule on which i work now.  went to 4th lunch, saw hannah and her crew, they all looked at me funny but i only actually made eye contact with them once while looking for other people, found them on the other side of the room, ate, smoked a cig and a clip, went to basic programming in which i feel smart, because this shit is easy, ive almost finished another lab, only 2 other people in the class are at my stage or a bit further. E period today i found out that after giving ms ross my forms tomorrow i can get dismissed and go to my internship and actually work, weeeej, so im doing that. um, i think im gonna take a shower now, i cant live without showering, im a very clean person. Misty keeps telling me she misses me and all this stuff, but she has a 21-year-old boyfriend now, and i did a lot of stuff at brown, so i dont see why SHE'S complaining when im alone now. anyways, i think im done livejournaling for the evening unless i think of something else to talk about, later

"event","well, i was sitting in AP latin today, and i looked over at jer (which ive been doing in latin for nearly 3 years), and she remains incredibly hot. i dont just mean hot, i mean the hottest of hots, if other girls were bulbs jer would be the freakin sun, not many compare. anyways, i was just thinking about that, she's very distracting, and i know i cant have her. oh, but you could josh, with more confidence, people sometimes say, but that's bullshit, and you know it, so quiet. um, a lot of work to do this weekend, time consuming trig (it's algebra II but it requires me to do work and neatly, 5 pages of it), 8-10 pages of translation for latin, no big deal if i focus, and maybe start on my internship stuff for the end of the month, I.E., two essays and possibly a page long journal entry (one a week but for 10 weeks). anyways, tonight im relaxing, tonight belongs to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. oh, and earlier today i chill with jenna and josh and dave, and it was ok, but im working pretty damned hard to keep everything together here (even if it looks like im slacking off and just posting journal entries about it, oops). and i spend most of my FREE time in the physics chat room a) furthering my education and b) furthering others' educations, later

"event","The Brilliant Dance 
So this is odd, the painful realization that all has gone wrong.  and nobody cares at all, and nobody cares at all.  So you buried all your lover's clothes and burned the letters lover wrote, but it doesn't make it any better.  does it make it any better? 
And the plaster dented from your fist in the hall where you had your first kiss reminds you that the memories will fade.
So this is strange, our sidestepping has come to be a brilliant dance where nobody leads at all, where nobody leads at all.
And the picture frames are facing down and the ringing from this empty sound is deafening and keeping you from sleep.
And breathing is a foreign task and thinking's just too much to ask and you're measuring your minutes by a clock that's blinking eights.
This is incredible,starving, insatiable, yes, this is love for the first time.
Well, you'd like to think that you were invincible.
Yeah, well weren't we all once before we felt loss for the first time.
Well this is the last time.

So she says,
""Everyone's going to the party
Won't you come if I come 
with a friend for your friend?
I'd be so pleased to see you
Out of the classroom,
Wearing the smile that I'll bring you.
I was hoping to learn a few things, like........
Do you do you like dishing the dirt 
On the whole class,
Talking the big smack, 
Or playing the fool?
Wearing all of the latest fashions
Or bucking the new trends?
Wearing your old threads
Or if you like coffee in the evening.
These are a few things,
That I'd like to know;
That I'd like to know.""

So I say,
""I've been scheduled to work,
But I'll call in.
And, my friend isn't busy, 
He'd be happy to join me.
And maybe my friend and your friend 
Will hit it off?
Or, maybe we will?
I'm dying to know........
Do you, do you like dreaming 
Of things so impossible?
Or only the practical,
Or ever the wild?
Waiting through all of your 
Bad, bad days;
Just to end them 
With someone you care about?
But do you like making out,
And long drives and brown eyes 
And guys that just don't quite fit in?
""Do you like them?""

""So, yes,
I'll see you there.""

***sigh***

DANIELLE IS A P.I.M.P.-CALL HER CAUSE SHE NEEDS SOME LOVIN'..EXCEPT FOR DAVID..UGLY PENIS.

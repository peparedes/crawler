"event","hey guys. this is matt and i'm just here to clear up some rumors that have been flying around the city lately.  first off...many have come to believe that tfb is ""broken up"" or not together.  this is totally not true.  we are still gonna be kicking out the jams for hopefully awhile longer, wheather you like it or not.  we have just stayed out of the limelight, because we wanna get a little better, and get some new orignals out and maybe put out a cd.  another rumor going around is that...tim and i have quit TFB to start up a new band with some people.  this is somewhat true has tim and i have started up a ""side project"" so to say.  but TFB is still together and healthly.  Sam Tim and I are best friends and making music is what we love to do.  hope this clears up any rumors or questions you have.  


wow...bands are dramamatic.

7th:  took notes the whole class...major hand cramp.  

post school: remind myself that i have to play in the pep band tonight which ruined my night.  but then funk came over and we chilled. and then the girls came stopped by for a while it was sweet.  congrats on the licenses a nye!

"event","hey duders.  well today (i guess yesterday now since its after midnight) was an amazing day over all.  the day started off as TEAM (thoughts of an early autumn morning) had a jam session and recorded some songs using the computer.  whats TEAM you ask.  well, it's the acoustic/emo/indie side project of matt and sam's.  it's pretty sweet.  they have a some songs hopefully getting on a website soon.  TFB on the other hand won't have any songs on the internet but we might make a demo that you can hear if you guys please.  TFB and TEAM both will have new pictures coming this week.  anyways...after the TEAM jam we (adam, matt, tim, and sam) decided it would be sweet if we went sledding in the cold weather with out any snow gear on.  we just had on sweatshirts, jeans, and hats on.  HOW HARDCORE! then adam tim and matt went to culvers and ate food, because tim had these sweet $1 off things.  and then we meet sam there and sat and talked about past events and stupid ideas we had.  after that we went to hannahs house and played the game scene it! it was awesome! the boys came out victorus and tim ""captain bad ass"" foster was the MVP of the game as he answered the most questions right, which included the game winning question!!! way to go tim.

anyway...thats what the day looked in the eyes of TFB

i dont have much to say about The floor below besides the fact that we are going to best buy tom. and jamming aswell! hopefully we'll write some songs or something.


ps- J-LO album hits stores tomorrow...my mom is making me get it for her.

anyway...enough about that garbage, and on to TFBizzle.  sam and i started writting a song entitled ""your bloody valentine"" it's a piece of art so far.  and we have some other song ideas in-mind. the sooner we write the songs the sooner we'll have them on the site under the ""media section"" as well as maybe the a EP or split maybe be realsed.  sam also made some sweet TFB buddy icons for you to enjoy they are sweet i must say.  merch will come sooner or later.

TFB NEWS: the website close to being finished.  it's lookin awful nice i must say. sam is a genius.  we also hopefully once tim gets back we'll record a couple orignals, and we'll re-master them, and make them aviable for you guys to hear!  cover songs also should be recorded for your listening pleasure.  new pictures will be taken as soon as tim gets back for J-Town.  i know it's the same old news that we've been saying for a while (the past month), but it should all be happening soon, i promise.  matt and sam also have a side project in the making...details will be realsed soon.

Brett you're my hero.  christmas time is my favorite time of the year, i know that sounds cliche, but it's totally true.  i find myself even two days after xmas, still in the christmas mood.  i bet i'll stay this way until school is back again (boo hoo). 


anyways...TFB is good.  we jammed again today.  blood was shed today, during the middle of ever so sweet (electric distorated guitar+bass+drums=hardcore version of ever so sweet TFB style).  matt cut his finger on sam's guitar when he was rocking out.  all is well though, he applied a bandaid and was set to go.  blood is funny.  we plan on jamming again tom. sometime.  hopefully we'll get a demo out soon.  if you want to hear our stuff talk to tim.

oh yeah...of course i forgot to talk about the most important new thing in the life of TFB.  Sam recieved a band new peavey 200 watt amp for xmas.  it is a beast!  it is the  newest member of the TFB family, and we love it already.  it adds a lot to the band, we're all excited.  hope to play shows soon!!

"event","what up gangstas? alright so lastnight sam kyle and i attempted a dangerous stunt.  we drove up (through the parking garage oh course) to the top of the civic center, after 6 which i guess is a crime.  officer ""george"" greeted us in a bitchass of a manner wearing a clip-on boe-tie, a cheap ""police"" stocking cap, and a plastic sheriff badge (he looked like a first grader dressed up as a police man for halloween), he was saying how we were going to have to come down stairs with him, because they have us on ""cameras"".  scared the shit out of me at first until we all realized that the words he was saying was all bullshit.  i then told him we were taking pictures for school...and then out of the goodenss of his heart allowed us to stay up there for an extra 10 mintues.  kind man george was.  he said that if the cops came he'd ""stick up"" for us and that we didn't mean to cause any trouble.  the second we all got into sam's car we all laughed for a good 8 mintues.  we drove down the ramp to the budget where we meet some dudes for the movie (brett chad natia cooper jaci jerramy and alex) in which we told the story over and over again till our stomachs hurt from laughing.  to make things better we saw one of the greatest movies made of all time (napoleon).  it was a good time.

on to band news.  we have a couple shows in the making right now.  details to be realsed soon.  we also plan on recording a demo cd in the next couple of months.  new band photos will also be on the site in a matter of time.

ok...on to tfb news. we've been pretty busy jamming and starting to write and soon to record on sam's computer.  it'll be rough but it'll be fun.  it will probably be an acoustic cd with a couple covers on it, and a couple origanls too.  tim and i had a jam yesterday to shape a couple songs.  it was short but sweet and we got a lot done it a little amount of time.  tim left his set over at my house, that was trouble.  i've been playing it non-stop today.  i'm like a kid in a candy store with that thing.  haven't hurt myself yet either.  drums are fun.

oh yeah in case i forget to update this before saturday...you should come see our good friends calpurnia rock out with the avenue, daybreak, and someday sooner.  its going to be a good ass time.  calpurnia will open the night off at 10 pm.  get there at 9 30, its going to be packed.  i know 10 this late but its going to be worth it, admission is only $1!!! please come watch calpurnia they are all good guys and make great music. hope to see you there!

TFB had there first full band jam in a while. it went smoothly.  we got a lot accomplished.  then after the jam we went to savers and buffalo wild wings.  we played this really sweet trivia game.  then we left to go to back to timmy's for a while.  then drama broke out has tim left his cell phone at buffalo wild wings.  he had to go quickly to get the phone so he could go to the party.  party you ask? well we went to this party last night at katie kins' house for lisa a's bday.  it was RAD!  the highlights of the evening were: scheid getting night in the face with a football causing severe damage to his nose, and forehead areas.  mikey ""is way rad"" lantz ran into a barn causing a near concussion.  hahahaha and some people tied a pop can on some string between two trees and then a SUV hit it and the guy driving it was pissed out of his mind it was so funny.  haha it seems like the last couple parties i've been too it seems like trouble always follows.  and last but not least, the ""FAB FOUR"" had a sweet meeting and made a cool cheer/hand shake.  jaci also taught me some words in japense.  like, i'm a ba, sorry, thank you, and bye bye.  it was cool.  the night was great.

Tim got sick because he ate cheese, we all felt bad but he still danced, and was crazy.  Matt showed Tim some of the ""hip"" dance moves, such as the ""clock"", the turn table, and the pengiun.  We all had a killer time, and all girls looked very pretty.  

That was just the start of the fun.  After the dance, we all went to Adam Scheid's house for the party.  It was a very cool time.  The girls and other guys that i didn't know left around 2, and that's when we became wild and crazy.  We ordered some pizzas at like 4 in the morning...and we sware that the pizza guy was gay as the guys as queer eye for the staright dude.  We stayed up all night (minus of couple of party poopers) and did the following: prank calling many businesses (sorry to the kwik trip man, and mike at walgreens we f'ed up their lives), sprayed garretts crounch with water when he was sleeping so it looked like he peed his pants, deep fried shit, had a masive silly string fight, danced like beyonce, smashed a cocanut, went to festvial, and avoided a near arresting by a po po in a green hat.

We are all close friends with them, and love their music.  We will be performing at Alex Ruff's house on August 28. So come check it out.  It will be a fun time.  

Speaking of Alex's house.... Tim and Matt ventured there lastnight.  It only toke us about 45 min. to find it (tim is bad at finding houses, he is a bitchass.)  Hahaha but we made it.  It was a great time, we all had a blast.  Everything went well until Matt got bit the Alex's Big scary dog.  He is recovering and should be ready to go soon.  

Anyway...
here's the music i've been listening to the most lately:

1. Matchbook Romance (Tim, Alex, and Matt are seeing them bitches)
2. Spitalfield
3. Limbeck
4. New Found Glory
5. The Early Nov.
6. Fall Out Boy (We are seeing them too bitches)



well i must get going

cheers

"event","Hoody.  Lastnight we all (Alex Sam and Matt) went to scheids for a night of fun.  The night started off mellow and quite.  People were playing some guitar, a game of a pool, and ""the greatest game on earh"" though some girls eyes, Tony hawk. Yeah, Tony's a nice guy and everything, but i'm just not very good at it.  The ""masters"", jac and jill tried to teach me but I get so pissed i shut the game off when jill almost as the record of 200,000 points and then she hits me Very hard.  But anyway.  After tony hawk Emily wanted to watch eurotrip, yes emily did.  Soon we all become extremely wild.  Adam was forced to move us out side.  The ""fire kings"" Gfunk, Matt and Sam all made a big fire pit, and started a fire.  But know he comes the bad part.  I'm just going to say it, we were jackasses.  Matt and Sam saw the ""three some"" on the hamock. We then flipped the three in the air as they came crumbling down to the ground.  We all laughed it up until we saw the seriousness they toke it.  Right after the flipping happened.  Jaci got up, covered with dirt, and walked away in disbelieve that her friends could of actually done that.  Alex was pretty upset as well, i would be too, i'm a player and i'm sitting there with 2 pretty girls, and then i get flipped that's pretty shitty.  Jill got up whipped off the dirt and starting looking for her valubles.  What we didn't know was that Jaci was actually hurt, which was the last thing we wanted to do.  So yeah this brings us to the next point.


Dear Ms. Jaci
   We know you were very upset.  We are completey sorry for anypain we caused you mentally or physcially.  We fell so so so bad about what we have done.  We hope that we all can move on.  We thought it was a funny thing to do, which it totally wasn't.  We are deeply sadden by your pain.  We hope you can forgive us for what we have done.

sorry for the pain we've caused
Sincerely Yours,
Sam and Matt"

Yesterday, The Floor Below jammed and partied.  Which is always a good time.  After the jam was over, we found ourselves hitting a Ninja Turtle with an Ice Scrapper out of pure boredom.  But then Garrett ""Gfunk"" Larson saved the day.  He knew it was 6 o'clock P.M. so we were all hungry, so ordered us a couple pizzas as we watched EuroTrip for the second day in a row.  Which is the best movie to watch with a bunch of horny dudes, not.  But the movie still is totally rad.  After that we soon walked aimlessly up state street until we remembered that manager Jaci lives near by so we walked until we got near her house.  But we were all to chicken to call her cell phone, or ring the door bell and ask if she was there.  So we sat on down and talked until we saw her drive by.  She then came down and talked with us for a bit and then we jumped on her trampoline, which is always fun.  So yeah, we then told some creepy stories, so we were all affraid for a bit.  But then my mom saved the day and picked up Tim and I, so we were safe.

On tuesday we all decided to go to ktb's poker party, which was a very bad decison.  Sam, Tim, and Garrett ended up pissing her off badly, as we found our way out the door, and pretty much kicked out of the party.  Then we hit up Adam Scheid's house witch is always very fun.  Then yesterday, Garrett and I went to Manz School too hang w/ Corey and Emily, but it was just too hot.  So we ended up walking to my house and cooling off.  We hung for acouple hours at my place, and order a pizza, and then Jaci let us into her house :-).  She was totally rad for doing that, and is a GREAT manager.  And last's all i have too say.


And oh yeah, Sam and I are going to make a little acoustic demo thing which will be coming out soon, I hope.  And it'll contain about 5 to 7 tracks, a couple origanals and a few covers from bands such as The Early November, Starting Line, and Jimmy Eat World :-).

I just got back from Sammy's house which was filled with joy.  Today, the Untied Postal Service (UPS) dropped off our Mics, a pedal, a splash cybal, mic stands, and cables.  It was a sweet day.  Then Sam and I suited up for another crazy jam.  We rocked out for serval hours, until our fingers bled, but it was fun.  Sam's guitar pedal sounds so so so good, and so to the mics.  I knocked over on of the mics and i totally thought i broke it, so i freaked out, but it still works.  And it looked cool, i guess.

TFB is going well, we really haven't jammed for a while which kind of bothers me, but it'll all work out.  The Mics, Splash cymbal, cables, mic stands, and distroation pedal are on there way, which totally excites me.  They could arrive TOMORROW AT THE KOERNER HOUSEHOLD :).  I hope soon that Sam and I can have a little Guitar and Bass and Vocals jam, before Tim gets back.  I miss Tim :(, i want him to  come back soon.

oh yeah, and if you play guitar you should totally come jam with us.  We are looking for another guitarist that Sammy will bond with, and rock out with.  Email us at the_floor_below@yahoo.com if you are interested.

I'll give this one more try, 
I'll give it all my best, and, I'll ask

I'm going to feel bad for timothy's parents...they know have to listen to sam's distrotion pedal, plus a new cymbal that tim will be rocking out on, and microphones that we will be trying to sing on.  The noise level has increased but so has the musical skill, and intellegence. We hope to play soon for you guys.  Talks of basements shows and a mini woodstock are in mix.  The mini woodstock aka garrettstock/ecstock is in process of getting under way.  Bands such as calpurnia (=<3), eggnog shake, Corey Glanville, Jordan, Ryan, and Adam's band, and more to be named at a later date.  The show which will be held on Garrett's grandfather's land will be in probably in early august.  And hopefully we can a few basement shows before garrettstock with Calpurnia and such, because they are simply amazing. 


And yes there has been some rumors flying around that Tim is Signal, which is 100% true, and other rumors such as tim is the hottest man in Eau Claire, which is 100% true.

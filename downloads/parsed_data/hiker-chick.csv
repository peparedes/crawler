Why have you decided that 10p is not a particularly good time to fall asleep? Similarly, what could you possibly find so interesting at 2a that you feel I absolutely, positively should not miss it? Moreover, why on Earth have you set my internal alarm clock for 5a (or earlier)?

Last but not least, what rationale could you possibly have for thinking that 8-10a is the ideal time to catch up on the z's that you/we missed?

Of course, the best shot would have been impossible to get anyway because it would have been me with a goofy grin, looking like a kid in a candy store in the second mezzanine at Radio City Music Hall. Alas, the event doesn't allow cameras, a fact of which we were not notified until we actually arrived. I did ask someone to get a shot or two after the event, back at the hotel. Unfortunately, he's not great with a camera, so you get my face but not much of the gown. (To <lj user=""miz_hatbox"">: It's periwinkle, not magenta, due to a last-minute switch.

<b>10 of the Best Things about My Trip to Manhattan</b>

<b>(10)</b> Admiring the gleaming marble and gorgeous vaulted ceilings of Grand Central Station, er (excuse me) Grand Central <i>Terminal</i> on Sunday morning and trying to imagine the madness of the same physical space on Monday morning.
 
<b>(9)</b> Being one of 3,000 people all trying to slowly shuffle out of Radio City Music Hall at the same time and realizing that Glenn Close is shuffling not two feet away from you in the opposite direction.

<b>(8)</b> Hot bagels and Central Park. 'Nuff said.

<b>(7)</b> Watching Patti Lupone get her second Tony award, 30 years after <i>Evita</i>.

<b>(6)</b> Getting caught in a downpour and waiting it out on the red-carpeted steps of the Plaza Hotel.

<b>(5)</b> Watching <i>Spring Awakening</i> (Best Musical 2007) and <i>A Catered Affair</i> and realizing that no time spent at a Broadway show is ever a waste.

Well, except maybe <i>Xanadu</i>. No, I didn't actually see it.

<b>(4)</b> Strolling right past the Applebee's and Cold Stone Creamery in Times Square to Restaurant Row on 46th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, which is filled with small, low-key, low-pretention, ethnically interesting eateries in which you needn't feel awkward asking for a table for one.

<b>(3)</b> Tearing up, again, at the animal parade from <i>The Lion King</i>, with which they opened the awards show. If you haven't seen it, I can't explain it. If you have seen it, I don't need to.

<b>(2)</b> Reveling in the distinct smells not only of a theatre's backstage (in this case, during a tour of the theatre that's doing <i>Young Frankenstein</i> but it doesn't matter because it's exactly the same smell as in my high-school auditorium) but also of a grand old library (in this case, the New York Public Library but it doesn't matter because it's exactly the same smell as the downtown branch of the county library in Portland).

<b>(1)</b> Wandering around looking for something or other and suddenly realizing that you're rapidly approaching the <i>New York Times</i> building. For a former college journalist, this is truly hallowed ground.

<b>(.5)</b> On the morning before you leave, realizing that the NYT building is right next to the theatre for <i>Rent</i>, which is one of your favorite musicals of all time, and that they are both just across 41st Street from your hotel. Which means that, strictly by chance, you spent three nights sleeping next to two of your greatest passions in life.
</lj-cut>

OK, so I wouldn't go so far as to say that I (heart) NYC. But I am definitely developing a serious crush on it."

"event","Huh. Apparently, my soccer team has lost its/our goalie for the spring season, and the captain has decided that the only fair solution is for the rest of us to rotate to that position. With 12 games and 11 players, I'll likely play goalie for an entire game. (Actually, two halves of separate games, but whatever.)

Here's the thing:
--Many players in my league aren't very good (such as myself) and rarely kick with significant force. Not a problem.
--Some are quite skilled and kick with not only significant force but also wicked accuracy such that the ball will probably come nowhere near me and yet still manage to fly into the net, leaving me discouraged but uninjured.
--The rest are somewhere in between and might manage to propel the ball <i>directly at my face with alarming speed</i>.

I wonder whether it's not only unfashionable but also against the rules to wear the mask of a hockey goalie. I'd lose some ""cred,"" but do I care? Moreover, can I manage to short-circuit my God-given and occasionally quite useful instinct of ducking when a projectile of any shape approaches my person in an intimidating and possibly concussion-inducing way? Inquiring minds...

--hightailed it down to Bellevue by 8a to spend 4.5 hours ostensibly learning C# (We're really not much past dragging buttons and check boxes onto a form. My dialog box is named ""Bonjour Le Monde."")

--did a jogging workout (Sa) and a swim workout (Su)

--shopped for groceries (twice) and picked up stuff at Fred Meyer (also twice: yeah, I didn't plan that particularly well)

--cooked enough fajita filling, chicken fried rice, and black-bean soup that I shouldn't need to go to the cafeteria at all next week

--finished and filed my taxes

--watched this year's production of <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> (Say what you will, <lj user=""jaunthie"">, it was pleasant if for no other reason than that the actress who played Marianne reminded me of <lj user=""monkeybard""> every time she was onscreen.)

An open invitation went out on the alias for Mountaineers under 40, and I thought ""What the hell..."" I asked whether I needed skillz of any kind, other than general fitness. They said, nah, come on by. And it was really fun. I'm not sure I served the team as much more than a warm body. (Specifically, they really needed someone to relieve the other three women on the team. In this 6on6 setup, you need three women on the field at all times.) But I think I played as much as the other gals. And I managed *not* to get hit in the face with the ball, as someone else did (totally not her fault, though). Or score against my own team, fall, foul another player, or anything like that. Yay me.

--Firm standpoint? From time to time, especially concerning hyphens.
--Likes to give a good fight? Pretty much never.

--Hardworking? Check.
--Beautiful physically and mentally? More so in the last couple years.
--Extremely outgoing? [buzzer] Thank you for playing.
--Good kisser? Um... no complaints?
--Loves to dream? I guess; it's just the implementation on which I sometimes drag my feet.
--Strong clairvoyance? I'd buy intuition more than clairvoyance, although I do really well at imagining all the bad things that could happen.
--Attracts others and loves attention? Negatory on both. Well, I might love attention when I get it, but I'm pretty bad at both drawing it and keeping it.
--Loves to help people in time of need? Mmmm... if we're emotionally close.
--Loves traveling? Depends on where and with whom.
--Dislike [sic] being at home? I'll tell you as soon as I stop hiding under the covers.

We were discussing how best to allow poster owners to continue work while allowing others to easily review them and provide feedback. Some said the posters should live on the walls outside our offices, so that reviewers can analyze them and mark them up. Others said that each poster should live in its owner's office, so that the owner would have every opportunity to make improvements, should inspiration choose to strike.

One brave soul suggested that the posters should live on the outside of the owner's door, so the the poster would be ""in the office"" when the door was open and ""outside the office"" when the door was shut. Brilliance. Sheer brilliance."

"event","On Saturday morning, it came to my attention that one of the headlights on my car was burnt out. Today, at lunch, I realized the other had gone too, which meant (as <lj user=""jaunthie""> correctly pointed out) that it was illegal for me to drive at night. Not to mention <i>stupid</i>.

With a quick glance at my owner's manual, I went to the auto-parts store, looked up the correct model of bulb for my car, selected two instances from the rack, purchased them, and dutifully minded the sign in the parking lot admonishing customers not to work on their cars on the premises. Drove home, managed (barely) to disconnect the power cable from one light, and disassembled the... assembly according to the directions. As with many things, getting the thing back together seemed to require considerably more skill than taking it apart. Worse, my meager finger strength was insufficient even to disconnect the power cable from the other instance.

Feeling like a total <i>girl</i>, I drove back to Schuck's and inquired about the possibility of one of the gentlemen behind the counter assisting me in this matter. (No, I didn't bat my eyelashes, but the situation definitely lent itself to that.) One helpful soul said he could tell me what to do but not actually do it himself. When we got out to the car and he saw that I had, in fact, tried it myself, he was much more game to getting his hands dirty, especially when he struggled mightily to remove the second power cable himself.

He was, in the end, successful. I gave him a $5 thank you and was on my way. Thanks also to <lj user=""jaunthie"">, who (before I had even gone to the store) insisted that asking for assistance of that sort was well within my rights. Good thing, too, cuz I never would have disconnected that damned cable myself, and I would have been SOL a couple days probably before getting the car to my mechanic's."

While the Magician is the primal spark, the idea made real, and the High Priestess is the one who gives the idea a form, the Empress is the womb where it gestates and grows till it is ready to be born. This is why her symbol is Venus, goddess of beautiful things as well as love. Even so, the Empress is more Demeter, goddess of abundance, then sensual Venus. She is the giver of Earthly gifts, yet at the same time, she can, in anger withhold, as Demeter did when her daughter, Persephone, was kidnapped.

"event","The book calls these ""Corn-and-Jalapeno Quesadillas,"" but the bell pepper seems the most pronounced ingredient. Whatever.

<lj-cut text=""recipe behind cut"">
1 tsp. olive oil*
1 c. corn (fresh or frozen)
1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
4 scallions, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tbsp. chili powder
1/2 tsp. ground cumin
1/4 tsp. salt
1/2 c. prepared salsa (or not, if you're <lj user=""jaunthie"">)
8 six-inch tortillas**
1/2 c. shredded, lowfat cheddar cheese***
non-stick spray

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees, and heat a medium non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.

2. In the skillet, swirl in the oil, then add the corn, bell pepper, jalapeno, scallions, garlic, chili powder, cumin, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender (about eight minutes). Remove from the heat, and stir in the salsa.

3. Spray one side of one tortilla with non-stick spray, and place the sprayed side down in a large, shallow baking dish. Add 1/10th of the filling and cheese, and then fold the tortilla in half. Repeat 9x.

4. Bake until the cheese is melted, about eight minutes.

5. Remove the quesadillas from the oven when your friends arrive, and chat awhile so that they can cool a bit before you slice each into four**** wedges (the quesadillas, not your friends).

*I used more than this, maybe 2-3 tbsp.?
**I used 10 tortillas.
***I used a cereal bowl's worth (about 2 c.), and it was not lowfat. Give me Tillamook, or give me death.
****I cut them into three wedges because four would have been, um, stupid.
</lj-cut>

As written, each wedge is two points. YMMV.

The morning (we awoke at 3a, started to walk at 6:30a, and finished by noon) was unusually cold and pretty overcast. You're supposed to be able to see the Big Sur lighthouse, but we couldn't even see the island on which the lighthouse sits. What we <i>could</i> see was pretty though.

"event","So a friend and I are walking 21 miles in about six hours this Sunday as part of the Big Sur Marathon (http://www.bsim.org/frame.html). We decided to meet up this evening to get dinner, shop for last-minute items at Title 9 Sports, and work out some logistics. We knew that Title 9 was in downtown Bellevue, and I wanted to eat at Bellevue Square. As we were making plans, my friend wanted to know whether Title 9 was ""walking distance"" from the mall. I pointed out that anything closer than 21 miles was, technically, walking distance for us, so, yeah, I was pretty sure that we could make the 4-5 blocks from one t'other.

Everything's relative, folks."

"event","I couldn't say, at this point, whether actual programming might or might not be as much fun for me as it seems to be for a significant number of my friends/family.

I do know that I spent six hours today in a special circle of hell, sitting in a classroom with some guy cobbling together a class about if/else conditions from what appears to be distant memory and random improvisation. I'm perplexed that someone who's supposed to know oodles about programming knows (or cares) so little about structured, detailed communication. A compiler would never put up with this crap. If the class were an actual program, I'd say that it has multiple Pri0, Sev0, recall-class, crashes-on-boot bugs.

Of course, I have no idea what BCC is paying this guy, but I'm paying them $300, dammit. It would have been nice if the teacher appeared to have done even a modicum of preparation. If I wanted off-the-cuff remarks, I have multiple geek-enabled friends who have offered private tutelage.

And I get to endure another six hours next Saturday. Where the hell's the Kahlua?"

"event","From the entry titled ""San Francisco burrito"":

""The aluminum foil wrapping, which is present whether the customer is eating in the restaurant or taking out, acts as a structural support to ensure that the tortilla does not rupture. One of the main difficulties of the San Francisco burrito is the issue of structural integrity, but skilled burrito makers consistently produce huge burritos which do not burst when handled or eaten. A successful large burrito depends on an understanding of the outer limit of potential burrito volume, correct steam hydration, proper wrapping/folding technique, and assuring that excess liquid has been removed from the burrito ingredients prior to inclusion.""

Someone put way too much energy into this."

"event","<p><br />like seriously. i trying my best to accept it, but dunno how long i can take this shit others are giving me. yes it is true that patience is a virtue, but it&nbsp;does run out. &nbsp;for those wondering why i'm so angry, i'll tell you guys here.<br /><br />it's all because of a simple problem turned complex, which is, last sunday's guard duty on 16 august. the story goes like this:<br /><br />basically A was scheduled for duty. but he told our bloody sergeant (BS)&nbsp;he got wedding dinner that night. so&nbsp;BS called B, as he was the reserve, to cover. but B also got relative's&nbsp;wedding to attend. so he called C, he also got something planned already. finally he called me. i told him it was my birthday so i confirm cannot do it, and i even told him to let me go enjoy my birthday. so after discussing with A B C, A said if no one can do it he will do it. so B C n myself we didnt do anything else since a said he going to do it. but on the day itself, A didnt turn up and got the other 3 of us into deep shit.<br /><br />so why am i angry? due to several reasons:<br /><br />1) because A didnt turn up, the 4 of us ( A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C n me)&nbsp;must do this guard duty on 24 august as PUNISHMENT. so i asked BS&nbsp;why the other 3 of us&nbsp;got punished just because A didnt turn up, because A confirmed he was going to do the guard duty. BS said we didnt confirm with him who was doing, and last minute he had to call replacement. i told him the&nbsp;3 of us dont deserved to be punished, instead just punish A la.<br /><br />this is the exact&nbsp;sms he sent the 4 of us:&nbsp;&quot;<u>4 0f u will d0 guard duty 0n 240809, m0nday.. Plus the nxt guard duty 0n&nbsp;d f0ll0wg m0nth, 4 0f u will b first 0n d list. I warned u 2 settle am0ngst 4 0f u... I b fair, s0 i punished all 0f u</u>.&quot;<br /><br />yea rite. so much for ur fairness.<br /><br />2) C n myself were not even in the reserve list, and he approached us to do. and because he called us, we got sucked into this whole equation for the guard duty. i asked BS how come me n C got sucked into this thing when in the first place we were not in the reserve list, much less involved. BS reason: <strong>because i called you 2 to help.<br /><br /></strong>3) dont tell me i cant even be spared even though it was my birthday? cos i got this other platoon mate, he was on duty and he got 2 days off to celebrate his birthday. let me repeat, <strong>ON&nbsp;DUTY and GOT&nbsp;2 DAYS&nbsp;OFF!</strong>&nbsp;like hello, just nice my birthday fall on my off day, so that&nbsp;i can go enjoy myself. lucky i didnt ask for extended off to celebrate. but die die BS&nbsp;want me to do guard duty. oh ya, another thing. this same platoon mate was scheduled for guard duty on tuesday nite, but he managed to &quot;run away&quot; and get the reserve to replace him. his reason: My fren's birthday. WAH&nbsp;LAO! fren's birthday wad, not your birthday. like dat oso can siam guard duty sia. WTF!<br /><br />4) there was another reserve, which is our senior. but BS&nbsp;die die dont want to call him, saying he got funeral to attend. like real la got funeral. from wat i know, dat saturday nite (15 august) he got some event going on.</p><p>5) and now, BS twisted his words about the guard duty. this is wat he sms me:&nbsp;&quot;<u>Khai, my first intention was 2 punished f0ur 0f u. Bt when i gv the punishment, it l00ked as if everyb0dy in d plat00n buat atleast sa2 guard duty. Hpe u understand.</u>&quot;<br /><br />nonsense sia. seriously WTF! first say different thing, now say another thing.</p>as of now, this matter is not settled yet. i'm still very&nbsp;unhappy. but i'm finding ways to go settle it once and for all. confirm the office will become a war zone. i'm just gonna bomb and bomb. so wat if he is a sergeant. like i fucking care."

"event","okay. i seriously dunno who still reads my blog. it's been sucha long time since the last entry. haha. anyways, there are good and bad updates coming up, so read on. start with the good ones first.

firstly, after dunno how many months, i finally 'repaired' my transformers belt. yay! actually the buckle is fine, just dat the belt snap. and i'm aiming to buy 1 buckle each month cos i saw nice ones at the DC shop at bugis there. got batman, superman, green lantern, flash, and some others. i'm so gonna buy la!

secondly, i've finally registered for my bike licence after a long time thinking. lucky got fuad, so at least won't be so lonely if go practical lessons. shawn pangseh us lor! but i think he registering soon oso. me n fuad bought the cheapest helmet there is, but of course it's the certified safe la. haha. now must spend wisely each month so can chiong prac, get licence and buy bike. can zoom around easier. haha.

lastly, free haircuts! haha! actually it's my bunkmate who cut for me and some others too. not a bad barber considering he only cut a few times before this. haha.

okay now for the bad updates. :(

firstly, my beloved purple handphone died. :( i first used it when i was in sec 2 (if i'm not wrong). come army used it again. almost one year in army, it died. maybe the fuse inside blow out la. the funny thing is, i was playing snake when it died. never drop or anything. sad sia. need to look for cheap, cameraless handphone.

secondly, deployment this time round will be minimum up till september, but can stretch all the way to november. it's quite sian thinking about it but on the bright side, i'm doing my job to protect the island. and in between, there are major events coming up such as, my 21st birthday, fasting month and hari raya. i hope God gives me the strength to pull through.

lastly,, i'm mentally prepared not to celebrate my 21st birthday, even though people always say &quot;21 is the key to unlock your freedom.&quot; i haven 21 oso i got freedom lei. haha. but i die die want my 1st day of hari raya. it's like hari raya is the time to meet relatives to seek forgiveness and also wear new baju kurung. yea!

actually, like not much update lei even though 3 months never come here. haha. what to do. leading a boring life ma. haha.

--
somehow i feel that my army friends aren't being truthful enough to me. like today, we were talking about this guy, A. and suddenly B and C told me that among all of us, A don't like me the most cos i keep picking on him. maybe he said that cos i'm the noisy one who is always asking them to fall in fast. ok nvm, i'm fine with that.

but what makes me sad is that B and C are close friends to me, but they dont want to tell me earlier about this problem. wait until now then say. i had mixed feeling when they told me just now. shocked, angry. time for self-reflection again."

lyrics:

Don't you ever wish
You were someone else
You were meant to be
The way you are exactly
Don't you ever say
You don't like the way you are
When you learn to love yourself
You're better off by far
And I hope you always stay the same
'Cause there's nothing 'bout you I would change

I think that you could be
Whatever you wanted to be
If you could realize
All the dreams you have inside
Don't be afraid
If you've got something to say
Just open up your heart
And let it show you the way

Don't you ever wish
You were someone else
You were meant to be
The way you are exactly
Don't you ever say
You don't like the way you are
When you learn to love yourself
You're better off by far
And I hope you always stay the same
'Cause there's nothing 'bout you I would change

Believe in yourself
Reach down inside (ohh-oooh)
The love you find will set you free
Believe in yourself (ohh-oooh)
You will come alive
Have faith in what you do
You'll make it through

Ohh-wooahh-ohh
Heeeeeyyy

Don't you ever wish (ohhhhh yeah)
You were someone else
You were meant to be (you were meant to be)
The way you are exactly
Don't you ever say (Ohh-wooahh-ohh)
You don't like the way you are
When you learn to love yourself (love yourself)
You're better off by far
And I hope you always stay the same (stay the same)
'Cause there's nothing 'bout you I would change (change)

No, there's nothing 'bout you I would change . . .

Don't change . . .<br /></pre>"

"event","<p><br />after what had been discussed today, i really felt relieved. all our feedbacks have not fallen on deaf ears and i&nbsp;am very sure&nbsp;that actions will be taken to rectify the problems. we really cannot survive if we are continuously being treated like that each day.<br /><br />can you imagine, in the first 3 days of us being there, 3 people broke down crying and that includes me too. like seriously. who would have thought i will be the first one to break down. not to boast, but i've always been the one encouraging people whenever we go through hard times. i think most of them were shocked when i cried. but the good thing is, i felt much better after crying it out. maybe i was just too stressed up.</p><p>to sum things up, i really hope major actions will be taken in order&nbsp;to prevent these things from happening again in the future. cos it won't reflect good to the parties involved.</p><p>--<br />on another note, i'm going to start saving money each month starting from this&nbsp;month. the thought of saving struck me because of this recession thingy that's happening. and some more, i need to start planning for my future already. turning 21 this year, i will definitely have to instil some discipline in myself. if i don't start saving now, when will i ever start? some of my plans in the next 5 years: work, take bike and car licence, save more money, plan for marriage, and find a girlfriend (if no girlfriend, how to marry sia? HAHA!)<br /><br />i will spend my money wisely from now on, cos each month i will only have a small amount of money to spend. :)</p>--<br />random thoughts:<br />i want a girlfriend! HAHA!<br /><br />but hey, snap back to reality. it's not easy to get a girlfriend nowadays, due to some reason or another. i think so far i failed quite terribly to find a girlfriend. if you want to know, ask me personally ah. haha!<br /><br />but if i wait, and don't find one, i dunno when i will get one. okay. so maybe it is true that God might have some plans for me in the future. like what malays like to say, &quot;kita merancang, Tuhan yang&nbsp;menentukan,&quot; which means, &quot;we plan, but God decides.&quot; somehow rang a bell somewhere in my head."

YOU FUCKERS CAN&nbsp;GO&nbsp;DIE!!<br /><br />--<br />well, i thank God that i have very good friends who cheers me up when i'm down. those usual people are simply the best. hanging out with them reduces my stress level. at least i can laugh and forget about all my troubles. :) and yes, like what shawn said, we need to find a fix hangout spot for our group. because we always go to random places to lepak, talk cock, camwhore&nbsp;and just enjoy the night.</p><p>but guys, if very week i'm only out on saturdays, maybe i can meet you all every 2 weeks once. i need to spend time with my family too. but you can tell me of any plans, then i can go meet you all. :)<br /><br />and now that althea has gone back to aussie ,we have 1 less person for our meet ups :(<br /><br />--<br />and ytd, met 5 of&nbsp;my primary school mates for the first time in 8 or 9 years, i supposed? 2 guys&nbsp;and 3 ladies.&nbsp;not much has changed about them, but now it's like they prefer to speak in english rather than malay, like how we used to in the old days. and i think i grew too big. haha. i was talking to the ladies, and i noticed that&nbsp;they&nbsp;were like very small compared to me. last time we were all about the same height. haha.<br /><br />and i couldn't believe that i sat in the bus with my primary school crush. HAHA!! but i think we all got over it, and we chit chatted like nothing happened before. the ladies are all in uni, but they are all very smart so not surprising la.<br /><br />and we are having a gathering nx friday night, don't know if i can make it or not. it's like everything is in place, den if i can't make it,&nbsp;very wasted.<br /><br />--<br />done with blogging for now.<br /><br />i didn't know that that small mistake i made is going to make me regret painfully.</p>"

Dave Ming Chang, that was the spaceship-cum-human's name on Earth. haha! after movie, hanged around a while before all went home.</p><p>--<br /><strong><u>160808</u></strong></p><p>my BIG day! but this year's celebration was very low-key la. i also can't be bothered to have celebrations. haha. met kengkee and went to funan. looked for the external hard disk which i want. should be buying it when i get my next pay. hehe. went to suntec carrefour, buy sushi, and sat outside suntec to eat while waiting for shawn to join us.</p>birthday SMS-es came in throughout the day, and some from people whom i least expect to wish me. but nonetheless, thank you everyone for the birthday wishes. wanted to play arcade at suntec but it was closed down for renovation. so went to marina square's arcade, played a while before we switched to pool.<br /><br />--<br />well, that basically sums up my last 3 weeks' of updates.<br /><br />off to Tekong! bye people!"

1) remember in my last post i said that my tv broke down? well, my dad bought a new tv. when i entered my house, i was shocked to see a 42"" Plasma TV hung on my living room hall! cool man! 

2) i have successfully fit into the&nbsp;polo-T which samantha bought for me&nbsp;when she went to Thailand. :) 

3) KengKee surprised me by asking, ""How come&nbsp;you in LOM Alumni Committee?"" i didn't quite get what he was trying to say. he said someone told him that he/she saw my name in the TP alumni page. i went home to check and it is true. maybe my lecturers put my name in it la. 

-- 
some random things again. 

i was supposed to blog this upon my first bookout, but i forgot. well, here it goes: 

""Thanks to those friends who sent me well wishes, be it through SMS or MSN, when i was enlisting.&nbsp;Those people like KengKee, Shawn, Cheryl, Samantha, Calvin, Tracy, Woonyah and&nbsp;Muhammad. Your well wishes has&nbsp;strongly encouraged me and i will do my very best in these 6 months.""

"event","<p>i have a sudden urge to blog about BSC. here it goes..<br /><br />well, basically in my 3 years of poly life, i had been very much&nbsp;involved with BSC activities. at first, i don't even know that BSC existed, until their SL recruitment period. Valerie asked if i wanted to join as an SL, but in the end,&nbsp;i joined as Log Comm. this was where the fun started. i somehow 'created' the logistics commitee, cause no one else wanted to join and the other 3 are&nbsp;all of them are my friends. there were 2 other girls, yansiew and yuling, and this guy, fadzli, who was from my french cds class. the 4 of us were like superheroes, running everywhere in school for SL Camp and Week Zero Orientation. haha. those were the days la. and through log comm, i knew more people. people whom i spent the next 2 years in poly hanging out with almost everyday. to mention some - cheryl, samantha soh, keagan, etc. and that was the 2nd consecutive&nbsp;year that Business won overall Overall Champion for Week Zero!<br /><br />den in year 2,&nbsp;i decided to run&nbsp;for BSC Main Comm elections. got into the Main Comm AY 06/07&nbsp;with 89 votes. it wasn't that competitive last time, though. as a main comm, i had to work with the different people, with different working styles, and different attitudes. it was really&nbsp;a challenge. but through it all, i managed to be close to some people, like wesley, shawn, daniel goh. they are really my brudders in main comm. 1 whole year with the main comm was really fun. yes, even though there were arguments, miscommunication, misunderstandings during events, those were the things that bonded us and brought us even closer to one another. i know that the main comms screwed things up during Week Zero, but the fact that we won&nbsp;Overall Champion&nbsp;for the 3rd consecutive year, somehow managed to ease the pain of screwing things up. how i wish i could turn back time to when i was in year 2. and that year, i got to know some more people like kengkee, kannan, etc.<br /><br />year 3, i ended up running for elections again. wesley and i ran together, along with others like kengkee, kb, apple, woonyah, sharyl, zixin, loulin, jo-an. there were 2 or 3 more, but i just can't remember who. anyways, i got into Main Comm AY 07/08, surprisingly. cause my one and only poster had been blown off by strong winds, even before voting starts. so another year in the main comm. again with the arguments, miscommunications, misunderstandings, conflicts, etc. but nothing was sweeter than winning Overall Champion for the 4th consecutive year, along with other trophies:&nbsp;Olympiad, Regatta and Best Spirited Award. and i forgot to mention this:<br /><strong><font color=""#ff0000"" size=""4"">I LOVE MY BSG SLs TO THE MAX!</font></strong> they are one hell of a bunch of fun people!<br /><br />and this year, i hope the BSC Main Committee AY 08/09 will work with one another closely and bring Business Studies Club to greater heights. Win all 5 trophies this year: Olympiad, Regatta, Best Spirited, Cheerleading and ultimately, OVERALL CHAMPION!!<br /><br />2 years in BSC as a Main Comm&nbsp;really means alot. the things i went through in those two years are priceless. the friends made, the people met, the people who knows me, advisors - Thanks so much for making my time serving as a BSC&nbsp;Main Committee of AY 06/07 and AY 07/08 a truly memorable one. I really enjoyed every single minute of it. I will definitely miss everything about BSC and people related to BSC. Love y'all man!</p>"

HAHA!). anyway, it was a good movie. didnt regret watching it cause initially i wanted to watch another movie. after movie, went to Ice3 at century for waffles. den played with arcade with kengkee and shawn. keagan didnt play cause he was talking on the phone.<br /><br />the funny thing about playing in arcade is that me, kengkee and shawn were glued to our seats playing the Winning Eleven 2008 Arcade Challenge. keagan says from outside it really looked funny. i think its because of our different expressions la. haha.<br /><br />i had to go home after arcade cause going to take family photos for my graduation. my mum planned all this photo-taking.<br /><br /><strong><u><font color=""#ff9900"" size=""4"">wed:</font></u></strong><br />met cheryl, kengkee and keagan at school to return graduation robe. cheryl reached first to return, followed by me. den we&nbsp;went to meet kengkee at mushroom before going mensa for lunch. keagan came slightly later cause he overslept. haha. went Bistro Walk for desserts. all of us had waffles. whee~ yummy yummy!</p><p>den all of&nbsp;us went TM walk walk, before going sunplaza park to play SWING! haha. really miss those times playing swing as a kid! swing too much till my stomach cramp. haha! after that went to library. supposed to just cool ourselves down, in the end, it became a very ""fruitful"" trip. i'm serious man!<br /><br />we sat at the junior readers section&nbsp;(haha!). for small kids, i know. the most funny person there is kengkee. he was reading a lot of&nbsp; kids chinese stories for cheryl and keagan. the 2 of them kept laughing and laughing. even though i didnt understand, but i laughed too cause of the way kengkee read the stories to the two of them. he can be a pre-school teacher la! sit there and tell stories to the small kids.<br /><br />cheryl left to meet her parents for dinner at TM. 3 of us left around 9pm, went to changi village to eat nasi lemak. yup, super last minute decision. on the bus there, kengkee told us some jokes, from the book he borrowed. now the book is with me. haha. i wanna stock up on my lame jokes!!<br /><br />we ate quickly, considering it was kind of late, den went home immediately after that.&nbsp;i reached home about 11pm.<br /><br /><strong><u><font color=""#ff9900"" size=""4"">thurs:</font></u></strong><br />den today, i had to go back school again cause i forgot to submit my award reply slip. super sians. after that, took bus to changi village (again) cause i'm supposed to meet my mum&nbsp;after she end work. she works at changi cargo complex. i decided to wait for her at changi beach instead. i walked the&nbsp;whole length of the beach, from changi village side, all the way to somewhere near cargo complex.<br /><br />didnt knew that walking at the beach is such a fun thing. the breeze, kids playing on the sand so happily. no wonder people like to go to the beach. it is seriously a good place to destress, or just to lepak and talk cock. anyone wants to be my beach lepak partner? haha!<br /><br />after my mum knocked off from work, went dinner. where? changi village. but i had something different today, Nasi Ayam Penyet. it was okay la. not as absolutely nice. i rather eat normal chicken rice. went straight home after dinner.<br /><br />--<br />p.s. i'm freaking bored in the early morning, after typing all this.</p>"

Hub at Downtown East, Pasir Ris.<br /><br />initial plan was to watch 2.35pm&nbsp;movie, den bowling, followed by dinner. but had to change plan cause lewis couldn't make it in time for the movie and he could only reach at 3.15pm due to some problems. so we went to lvl 1 for bowling, but the queue was freaking long and we were on waiting list. went back to lvl 4, bought movie tickets for the 4pm show, den played arcade while waiting for lewis to reach.<br /><br />we played bowling when lewis reach. played 2 games, 20 frames in total (1 game = 10 frames). 4 of us quite noob la. a lot of times go inside the longkang cause of wrong bowling techniques. haha. but i did okay la. average of 1 strike and 1 spare per game. den the others frames are like average. haha. while busy bowling, i dont even know how my jeans got torn, until i wanted to sit down and realised it. but lucky no one saw, except for my 3 frens. and just nice we were finishing our 2nd game when it happened. bought safety pins from NTUC, den proceeded to watch movie.<br /><br />Wah. Indiana Jones is a super cool movie la. the&nbsp;first movie i watched in over a year. a lot of funny scenes in the movie. i wont say much about the movie cause i dont want to be a spoiler for those who havent watch. haha. go catch the movie people!<br /><br />after movie, i spent like 15 mins in the toilet just to pin up my jeans cause it was a big tear. like seriously. from below the zipper, to almost halfway down the left side. and people thought i was shitting. haha. went dinner after that, den lewis drove us to ECP just to walk walk there. watched people play soccer at the new futsal area. cool sia. i want to book and play there also!<br /><br />we spent about half an hour at ECP, den lewis sent all of us home. but actually he was a bit reluctant to sent us home, but cause of my torn jeans, he did me and the others a favour. haha. thanks lewis!</p>"

"event","<p>yea! finally had the i-want-to-blog kind of feeling. haha!<br /><br />well, today was very much spent nua-ing at home. play computer, strum the guitar, listen to songs, watch tv.<br />these few weeks can say my sleeping hours is damn short. something is wrong with my biological&nbsp;clock, i supposed. haha.<br /><br />imagine sleeping at 5am plus each day, and wake up around 11.30am - 12pm like that? like can die, seriously! even though i feel tired each day after coming home, i just can't sleep la. weird me.</p><p>okay. let's talk about today. supposed to follow my parents to singapore expo for dunno what fair, but because i was feeling damn lazy, i decided to stay home. then went to meet kengkee and keagan at compass point because keagan wanted to have dinner, and coincidentally, kengkee was at his grandma'a house which is very near my house. haha.<br /><br />after dinner, we walked around compass point a while, and went to Macs. me and keagan bought ""today"" (sundae!) and kengkee bought chocolate milkshake. slack at macs a while, finishing our food then went to arcade. we literally watched people play the games there. then the funny thing happened: keagan's havaianas SNAPPED! LOL! dunno how, but ya, it snapped! super unlucky la him. he walked barefooted after that.<br /><br />keagan left shortly after,&nbsp;so me and kengkee walked around some more. and to my surprise, i saw Gen and Aaron there too! seriously didn't expect to meet them there la. like 'wow!' haha. after that, went to find shawn at cold storage because he was buying some grocery with his mum.<br /><br />so we left compass point, and headed to my house to slack a while. supposed to slack under my block, in the end,&nbsp;slack at my house because&nbsp;kengkee wanted to go toilet. played guitar, watch a bit of youtube, den they left around 11pm plus like dat.<br /><br />okay. i can foresee a hectic week ahead as it's one week before SL CAMP! i hope&nbsp;i am able to rest more this week, but&nbsp;i can predict it won't come true. haha. see if i'll have the time to blog again in this week. if not, wait till after camp ends.<br /><br />till then,<br />adios amigos!</p>"

"event","wow.. it's been such a long time since i last blogged. 20 days to be exact. so much things happened during these 20 days that i dunno where to start blogging from. lol. i know. i'll just blog bit by bit, whichever comes into my mind as i type. :))<br /><br />Warning: This is a looong entry. Readers beware! LOL!<br /><br />--<br />WOO!!! SL CAMP is coming soon!!! Interviews will be held next week from 29 Jan - 1 Feb 2008. Check BSC notice boards for more details about the interview dates and venue. Please do join and let's strive to make Business School champions for the 4th consecutive time!<br /><br />--<br />okay. i can't believe that some people have this ego in them which they just can't put aside, even on the smallest thing. <strong>egoistic people should just be banished from this world la.</strong> super fed-up with this kind of people. and not only the ego, the attitude also like small kid like that; ""i disturb you can, but you cannot disturb me"". tell me, isn't that a small kid's attitude?<br /><br />and another childish attitude is that these people dunno how to differentiate between jokes and seriousness. everything others say, they will take it seriously. then behind the person, they will bitch like there's no tomorrow. the worst thing is if the person who bitches is a guy. like wtf can?!<br /><br />--<br />so far, i think 2008&nbsp;has been a&nbsp;not-so-good year for me. it's only the first month and shit things are happening to me. to be exact, <font color=""#ff0000""><strong>betrayal</strong></font>. it's very saddening when you trust a person, share problems, share secrets, talk about things happening around,&nbsp;and especially if the secrets shared are those personal issues, eg you like this person, you hate this person, etc., and the ""trusted"" person easily betray you by telling the&nbsp;other&nbsp;person casually. they see it as nothing wrong.<br /><br />but please think before doing anything. if you were in the person's shoes, and your friend whom you trust most, betray you by telling others what you said, how would you feel? and because of this incident, i've learnt&nbsp;a very painful lesson.&nbsp;i am now very wary of the people whom i share my personal stuffs with. i suspect i know the culprit which betrayed me. but i do not have enough evidence to proof that that person is the one. so i'll just let the matter past, unless the culprit wants to own up (which i think will be very impossible!).<br /><br />and from that day onwards, i've adopted a mentality: <strong><u><font color=""#ff0000"" size=""4"">DTA!<br /></font></u></strong><br />--<br />is it true that&nbsp;people will stick more to their new friends more than old friends? i dont think i ever did that. but if i did, i am now making amends by spending more time with my old friends.&nbsp;yupps. i'm not saying this because i'm jealous that people stick with their new friends. its okay la,&nbsp;i feel. for me now, i will try and spend equal time with all my friends while i still can, cause i might not have a chance to do so once i graduate.<br /><br />hmm... but&nbsp;i think that this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sensitive&nbsp;issue to some, so i won't proceed anymore. yea! :))<br /><br />--<br />this week is the last week to do FYP. everything is going smoothly except for some delays on certain stuffs, here and there. submission is next monday 28 Jan, and our presentation is on 29 Jan. how fast man. then, we still need to go to TAS to present also, but we have not fix a date yet. once all presentations are done, i'm free of all projects!! i can concentrate fully on my studies and aim to score as good as i can for my exams.<br /><br />after exams, will be concentrating fully on SL Camp, and Week Zero. these are the last 2 major events for me as a student in TP. i will definitely miss all the friends whom i had&nbsp;known throughout the 3 years in TP, especially those who i am very close with such as shawn, cheryl, keagan, samantha, and my IG main comms.<br /><br />--<br />i would like to congratulate the new LIG Main Comms of their appointment. i expected those people to be in the main comm except for maybe 1 or 2 people. but nonetheless, i hope you guys can bond together quickly like us (the senior main comms) and if possible, try not to promote disharmony among the team. you guys, 11 in total, have been voted by your fellow coursemates, shows that they entrust you to bring LIG forward. prove to them that they have made the right choice in voting for you.<br /><br />eventhough i know none of you read my blog (i doubt the also know this blog existed), but still, i wish you guys all the best. i may be graduating soon, but the LOM fire still burns in me. if in any doubts, ask the LIG advisors. we'll have a sharing session among the seniors and juniors soon. :))<br /><br />--<br />lastly, before i end this entry, something emotional.<br /><br />i have to admit that i miss talking to this friend. we are not how we used to be. we were close, and now it seems that we are distancing apart. we used to have lunch together with/without&nbsp;the rest, and chit chat about things.<br /><br />it's just like one day, you started keeping yourself&nbsp;away from me and from then on, we never literally talk like how we used to. we only talk to each other when there is a need to. and no more lunch together, or&nbsp;casual chit chatting.<br /><br />i really dunno what is the main cause of us not talking to each other. maybe one of these days we can sit and talk. i would really like to know the reason, no matter how bad or hurtful it could be. i want to clear all doubts which&nbsp;exists in both of us."

I would like to thank 2007 too!<br /><br /><strong><font color=""#0000ff"">THANK YOU 2007 FOR ALL THE WONDERFUL MEMORIES! Eventhough there were alot of unpleasant memories too, but i&nbsp;am still grateful cause it had been a learning experience for me!</font></strong><br /><br />When we&nbsp;talk about 2008, we will talk about New Year's Resolutions. Well, I have mine too!<br />Let's see..<br /><br />1)&nbsp;Enjoy life while I can.<br />2) Do well in my final year in Poly, be it&nbsp;projects, assignments, tutorials, exams.<br />3) Learn&nbsp;to trust only my&nbsp;few trusted&nbsp;friends, and not just&nbsp;anybody.<br />4) Give my love life a break.<br />5) Stop doing all the bad things which i had done in 2007.<br />6) Exercise more and get myself in shape for NS.</p><p>Yup. That should be all for my New Year's Resolutions. I hope to fulfil most of them. :)<br /><strong><u>YES DIN! YOU CAN DO IT! HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF!<br /></u></strong><font size=""1"">(motivation. haha)</font><br /><br />--<br />I wanna recap some of wonderful memories of 2007&nbsp;which i hold dearly in my heart:<br /><u><br />1) Birthday<br /></u>I must say, last year's birthday was the most memorable for me. It was unlike all the past year's. The celebrations was like so unexpected. Especially from LIG ExCos. They ""conned"" me saying that there was meeting but actually they wanted to surprise me. Thanks guys! Eventhough the plan to smash&nbsp;my face into the pandan cake soaked with whipped cream worked, I&nbsp;STILL&nbsp;LOVE&nbsp;YOU ALL! YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST! &lt;333<br /><br />Plus all the birthday wishes from friends, the 2 other guys who shares the same birthday as me, and the other celebrations. And not forgetting the cake which Apple made for me. Thanks everyone for making my 19th birthday a memorable one!<br /><br /><u>2) Leadership Award<br /></u>Well, what can i say? After a whole&nbsp;year in BSC, i am super happy to have received this award. A good recognition for the service done for TP and also Business school students.<br /><br /><u>3) Camps!<br /></u>The experience of being an FA (facilitator) for SL Camp and SubComm Camp&nbsp;was really enjoyable but tough. But still, I made a lot of new friends from just being an FA. and I would like to thank those in my group for being very participative during the duration of the camps.<br /><br /><u>4) Week Zero Orientation<br /></u>We won for the 3rd consecutive time last year! Eventhough we had some tough competition from the other schools and also last minute planning, it makes the winning feeling even sweeter. Will definitely do my best again to make sure Business School win for the 4th consecutive time!&nbsp;It will be a good graduation&nbsp;gift,&nbsp;not only for me, but for all&nbsp;my fellow Year 3 friends, who&nbsp;are joining&nbsp;SL Camp again this year.<br /><br /><u>5) SIP<br /></u>Lastly, SIP has also been a memorable one for me. Learnt alot of things in 12 weeks attached to the company. True that I had to do labour work most of the time, but I still enjoy it. I miss all my colleagues and my Boss!<br /><br />--<br />and talking about the good things, definitely there will be some not-so-good things in 2007.<br /><br /><u>1) Deaths<br /></u>Firstly, the deaths of 2 soccer players - Antonio Puerta and&nbsp;Phil O'Donnell - both of heart failures as revealed by post-mortem reports. Quite a sad thing to happen in a football world. Puerta, 21, &nbsp;was deemed to have a bright future in football and was on&nbsp;the&nbsp;way&nbsp;to achieve greater things. O'Donnell, 35, was a good man and enjoying the latter stages of his footballing career. But, God loves them more than humans love them. Rest in peace.<br /><br />Secondly, the assasination of Pakistan's oppositon party leader, Benazir Bhutto. She was the leader of Pakistan People's Party, known as PPP, and also the most direct threat to current Pakistan President, Mr Perves Musharraf. She was shot twice before she was proclaimed dead at hospital, after efforts to save her failed. Now, because of her death, the election had to be&nbsp;pushed back 12 weeks further, from its original date on 7 Jan 08.<br /><br /><font size=""1"">i can't think of anything else right now. If i have, I'll add to this part. hehe.<br /><br /></font>--<br />oh ya. the days leading up to the end of 2007 were quite sad, shocking, disappointing.<br /><br />to be continued..</p>"

"event","<p>before i go to sleep, maybe i'll just blog a little bit. hehe.<br /><br />so, christmas is coming. the season of joy, happiness, giving and most importantly HOLIDAYS! haha. but yea, holidays doesn't feel like holidays cause of the various projects, schoolworks which need to be done. worst thing is the time, which is like so fucking&nbsp;fucked up.<br /><br />fyp is due in 29 Jan 08. and with 2 weeks if holidays, my group can't even go collect data for our project. why? because our project is&nbsp;at TAS and it is also school holidays. like so wtf can?! my group is seriously at a disadvantage compared to others, whose fyp are mostly on companies, not school. so these 2 weeks, my group will have to read up on certain things. and when school reopens, we will have to rush like mad for our project.<br /><br />and talking about project, i tried to talk to you, but you just don't seem to care. maybe you were stressed over the deadline for submission. dat i can forgive you. but then, your face shows like you were angry, not satisfied with things that was done. you might say that you were not throwing tantrums, but it seems like you were.<br /><br />so how much longer will you not talk to me? 1 month? 2 months? 6 months? 1 year? such a waste the friendship that was built is going down the drain. maybe its my fault. or maybe its yours. but whatever it is, why can't we be friends like before? why must we let things get between and spoil&nbsp;our friendship?<br /><br />if you happen to read this, i'm definitely sure that you know it is you i'm talking about. and maybe we can talk things out and see what are&nbsp;the problems that is happening.</p>"

"event","<p>okayy. this might be a long entry of various things. so whoever is reading it, please be prepared. lol.</p><p>--<br />i'm back from camp last night. was quite tired but i don't know why. foodmin was supposed to be very slack.&nbsp;maybe it is because i got flu on 1st day of camp, that's why i felt tired. this year's camp was not bad and the experience of being in foodmin was quite enriching. haha.<br /><br />but i realised that this year's GL wasn't so enthu like previous years' ones. but nonetheless, there were a lot of&nbsp; new and original cheers from the 5 empires. and some were so funny that we foodmin people just ended up laughing our asses off when we hear their cheers. imagine cheers with 'sai' and 'pangsai' in it. haha.</p><p>but overall, foodmin received a lot of good feedbacks from everyone - main comms, prog comm, log comm, GLs - for our good service at meal times. :)) and the foodmin people rocks! love them all! &lt;333. and i think our foodmin ochestra really rocks la. LOL!<br /><br />and i think some people not happy with me cos i joined otc. i know that i told you all it's best not to join cos it will be hectic for you guys. but since you all joined, did i even scold you? no. i just let it be. then you found out i joined too and you complained saying that, ""he tell us not to join. in the end also he join."" but did i join as GL? no what. i tell u. foodmin is way relax then being a GL. we got more free time than you all. bear that in mind.<br /><br />and during camp, i see the bad side of some people too. being glutton, that is. but its&nbsp;not the&nbsp;GLs.<br /><br />and also, i LOVE my dance partner to the max!! lol! thanks for always being my dance partner, and sometimes,&nbsp;willingly volunteering to be my partner. LOVE YOU LA!! &lt;33</p><p>--<br />i just don't understand my parents. everytime, when i come back from camps, confirm will have some rubbish things they want me to do.<br /><br />like today, when i was sleeping, my mum keep asking me to wake up to buy bread for her. and when i told her i was tired, she grumbled. and next moment, my dad was out shouting at me, asking me why i can't help to go and buy bread for my mum. i told him politely i was tired since i just came back from camp last night, so let me rest. den he continued shouting at me, which made me lose my cool. i shouted back and asked why they like to do this to me each time i come back from camp. it's like so unreasonable la. when i'm away for 3, 4 days at camp, they can go and buy things themselves. but when i come back, no matter how tired i am, all ask me to do. so wtf la.<br /><br />i know if they ask my sis, confirm she will say no. dats why they ask me. but please, if you know the feeling of being tired, i also know. so just let me rest as if i will bother you all. and cos of the 'argument', me and my parents are currently not talking to each other. haiss.<br /><br />--<br />okay. so what now? i guess now you know that i like you. but is that the reason for you to be so cold towards me? or did i do something wrong towards you? tell me.&nbsp;i seriously can't find a reason.<br /><br />even if you like someone else, no need to act like this right. go ahead and like your guy. i'm not stopping you or even saying anything. if you feel that you will be happy being with him, i will also&nbsp;feel happy for you. that's what friends do. be happy for each other. unless you don't&nbsp;think that i'm your friend. den dat is another thing la.<br /><br />and is it because of the same thing that made you don't want to inform me of project meetings until i ask you? even if i was in camp, you could have told me about the meeting beforehand.&nbsp;i can tell&nbsp;the heads that i have project meeting, and i am sure they will let me go since there were others who went off for project meeting too. but of course, you only told me when you guys were ""in the midst"" if the meeting. that was why i couldn't go. and some more, my hp wasn't with me at that time, so i only replied you at night.<br /><br />and today when i asked, then you told me we meeting again on friday. i'm not saying you don't take initiative or what. but i just hope for one thing - even if now you know that i like you, please don't let it affect our school matters. differentiate personal and school matters. that is what i term as being&nbsp;'professional'. if everything also you put together as one, then i think you will be even colder towards me for the remaining of this sem.<br /><br />i am so so&nbsp;disappointed. so many 'why' are running through my head.<br /><br />why are you doing this to me?<br />why am i always the one not informed of anything?<br />why am i&nbsp;the one who have to face all this nonsense things from you?<br /><br />WHY? WHY? WHY?&nbsp;<br /><br />--<br />after talking to some girls, now i really understand that looks have more impact than the heart does. so now, i truly believe you my friend when you told me, ""make an impact with the looks, den comes the heart.""&nbsp;you should know who you are la. haha. well, time really do change things.<br /><br />during the old days, no matter how fugly the person is, he/she will still be accepted as long their heart is pure and sincere. not like now, where looks matters more. this kind of girls who goes for looks rather than the heart, will only learn their lessons after they have been 'bastard' by good-looking guys.<br /><br />so to my same&nbsp;friend (as mentioned in para 1), let's go&nbsp;exercise and build up our muscles. den we can show off to people. haha.<br /><br />--<br />one last thing. planning an outing/gathering is always hard. i think i'll just give up on organising anything for anyone. seriously, if forget to tell, den the whole plan will have to postpone. and if tell too late, people will already have their own plans. and the best thing is, i'm doing it all alone. no one is willing to help me.<br /><br />ya. maybe that's life. but, whatever it is, life has to go on. even if we meet failures along the way.</p>"

L-O-L!!!</p><p>den walked around with cheryl and her 2 friends just to pass the time away cause waiting for FYP launch to start. they went lunch and i went back to biz school. met my fyp group mates inside&nbsp;lt 17. chit chatted a while before the whole thing started.<br /><br />and so its official: my FYP will be at Restaurant in the Square @ TAS. lol. so i'll definitely&nbsp;be there twice a week, tuesdays and fridays. but u never know. i might go there more often. lol.<br /><br />after fyp launch, went lunch with some frens opp school at the 24hour prata shop. wa service damn bad la. i waited nearly 30 mins for my murtabak but in the end i had to take away cause i got another event in school.<br /><br />went back for LOM Alumni Tea Party cause the lecturers wanted the LIG ExCos to help. not say really alot la. but around 100plus alumni turned up for the gathering, and some as long as 1999. can u believe it?! and one lady is pregnant, and the other has a 7-month-old son. so cute la the baby. lol!<br /><br />the event ended around 5. cleaned up the alumni lounge. and since there was a lot of leftover food, we had to pack. i gave woonyah&nbsp;2 full packets of beehoon and 2 packets of dumpling and soon kueh. and in the end, i brought back 3 full packets of beehoon, 2 packets of dumpling and soon kueh, and 1 packet of fried wanton. plus my packed murtabak which i didnt manage to eat. that's super alot of food. when i reached home, my mum asked where i got so much food. haha.<br /><br />--<br />yes, i may be not be as good-looking as those guys out there,<br />but that doesn't mean i am not good enough for you.<br />if it is looks that you go for,<br />then&nbsp;how about the heart?<br />how far can looks guarantee a relationship?<br />and so here i sit, waiting for you to open up your heart,<br />to accept my love for you.<br />i don't know if you know this,<br />but i'll take my time.<br />--<br /><br />till then,<br />adios amigos</p>"

"event","<p>okay. let's blog.<br /><br />about my horoscope - Leo.&nbsp;i received quite a number of emails on horoscopes.</p><p align=""center""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/deanisme/pic/00001bsr/""><img height=""191"" alt="""" width=""278"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/deanisme/pic/00001bsr"" /></a><br /><br /><span style=""FONT-SIZE: 12pt""><strong>Great talker.

Loves being in long relationships. Talkative. Not one to mess with. Rare to find. Good when found.</strong></span></p>hmm.. let's analyse each single point there:<br /><br />1) <strong>Great talker</strong> - i don't think i fit into the that category. i'm not a great talker. i usually will run out of words/topics to talk about. haha. or maybe i'm a great talker in the making? well.. you never know.<br /><br />2) <strong>Attractive and passionate</strong> - haha.i'm not attractive but i'm adorable! and yup, i'm passionate too!<br /><br />3) <strong>Laid back</strong> - of course i am! everytime also do things slowly. as if time is waiting for me. haha.but seriously, i really dont like to do things quickly. and as a result ,always suffer at the last minute. haha.<br /><br />4) <strong>Knows how to have fun</strong> - very true of me! fun is my middle name,&nbsp; i guess? HAHA! one example of knowing to have fun is to suan shawn. haha. shawn, if you're reading this, no offence. but it's damn true la! haha!<br /><br />5) <strong>Is really good at almost everything </strong>- nope. there are a lot of things in this world which i still dunno.<br /><br />6) <strong>Great kisser </strong>- maybe? never kissed before. but have been kissed a lot of times! haha! dats the consequences of being so adorable. LOL!<br /><br />7) <strong>Unpredictable - </strong>true. especially emotions-wise. i can be angry at this moment, but happy at the next. very, very&nbsp;unpredictable. only my close friends knows.<br /><br />8) <strong>Outgoing </strong>- definitely!<br /><br />9) <strong>Down to earth </strong>- i think i am. not trying to be hao lian, but when people praise or say good things about me, i just say&nbsp; 'thank you' and laugh, not thinking too much about what was said.<br /><br />10) <strong>Addictive </strong>- i'm not a drug! lol! how am i addictive? i dunno.. *blur*<br /><br />11) <strong>Loud </strong>- yup. i talk loudly (haha). and i always want my views to be heard before any decision is being made.<br /><br />12) <strong>Loves being in&nbsp;long relationships </strong>- who doesnt want? but i really love long relationships. it makes me feel more appreciated and loved, and i can show my love more to my partner.<br /><br />13) <strong>Talkative </strong>- very true!<br /><br />14) <strong>Not one to mess with </strong>- very true also. dont mess with me if you dunno me well. you&nbsp;will&nbsp;never know the consequences. believe me on this. a handful of people have been 'hit'. but i always control myself until i cant take it no more.<br /><br />15) <strong>Rare to find </strong>- am i an endangered species? LOL!<br /><br />16) <strong>Good when found </strong>- maybe. ask my close friends to know more on this. haha.<br /><br />--<br />basically, this summarises my analysis of my horoscope. now you roughly know me better. :)<br /><br />till then,<br />adios amigos."

"event","<p>Yup. As the title says, i'm&nbsp;gonna blog&nbsp;about that.<br /><br />This year, kinda sad to celebrate Hari Raya. It's like,&nbsp;I lost the feeling to&nbsp;celebrate. Don't know what happened to me la. Maybe partly due to my dad, but i'm not gonna say it here. Personal.<br /><br />Or maybe I'm missing some important people in my life, causing me to be like this. Haiss. My friends told me to enjoy this festive season, but can't find the&nbsp;will to do so.<br /><br />Usually,&nbsp;I would have collected more than $100 for first 2 days of visiting my relatives.&nbsp;But,&nbsp;so far,&nbsp;I've only collected around $80. Not that I mind la cause I know&nbsp;that as i grow older, the money will be lesser. Haha.<br /><br />And as I grow older, I now understand that Hari Raya is not just about collecting green packets. It's more of fostering closer ties among the relatives of both my mum and dad. True, this year, I met more relatives from my mum side than previous years. And most of them, their children&nbsp;are like around my age. But because&nbsp;we don't know each other that well, it just seems hard to start a conversation with them. If possible, i would also like to be close to the relatives on my mum side. But somehow, it just doesn't materialise.<br /><br />On a happier note, there are 2 new additions&nbsp;to the family&nbsp;this year for Hari Raya. 1 girl and 1 boy. The girl is my niece (yes, i am already an uncle at a young age) and the boy is my cousin. But poor thing la the boy. He&nbsp;is born a month before actual due date, so kinda premature. But nonetheless, he still looks healthy but rather too small. I'm even afraid to carry him, in case he slipped through my hands or something. Haha.<br /><br />random thoughts: words can't express what you mean to me.<br /><br />That's it for now. Going to sleep. Back to work tomorrow.<br />Good night!</p>"

"event","OMG la! Shauna Simon is really a one hot, cutie pie! And she's like only 26.. Haha! Anyways, so sad that she's out of Live The Dream. Stupid Victor Tang. His voice sucks big time and he got through to the grand finals. WTF?! I totally agree with Ken's comments that Victor has made history by going into the grand finals as the singer who has the worst voice. Indeed. It's so obvious he's in cause of popularity. He and Shauna can't be compared la. Shauna is way way way better than him can?! Those people who voted for Victor must be deaf la. ARGH! There goes my favourite Shauna. :( 

Ok, I'll stop the rumblings cause no point continuing, as if it will make any difference to the resuls just now. :) 

Hmm.. Let's blog about yesterday.. 

Weekly dinner was pathetic, only me and Kengkee went. Thanks to people like ***** who last minute pangseh us by not coming. THANKS! But nonetheless, still an enjoyable dinner cause so long never eat at Techno already. Haha. My favourite Half Fried/BBQ Chicken Rice. So nice~ Talked crap with Kk after dinner cause he waiting for his friend. Went home around 10.30pm. 

Oh yes, yesterday I went to do delivery to this company (SIP). And my oh my, I met a pretty lady. :) Super pretty! I forgot her name. It is something-rene. Can't remember. Cause I was with my boss, and he told her that his attachment guy will deliver the&nbsp;booklets to her office. So when I reached her office, she was sitting at her table. 

Me: Hi, is something-rene in? 
She: (smiling) Hi, it's me. 
Me: Oh ok (smiling, awestruck by her beauty). Here's the booklets from my boss. 
She: Thanks. You must be the new attachment guy right? 
Me: Haha. Yeap. 
She: Haha. Ok. Thanks again. 
Me: Welcome! 

As i turned to leave her office, she added: 

She: Hey, I like your hair! Super cool! (showing the thumbs-up sign). 
Me: Haha! Thanks! 

Actually wanted to tell her that her hair is also cool. But too late cause I opened the office door already. 
She got gold hair with blue highlights at her fringe. 

Hope can meet her again some other time. HAHA!"

"event","<p>One last entry before I go to sleep. HAHA!</p><p><strong><u><font color=""#0000ff"">6th October 2007<br /></font></u></strong>Was supposed to go school at 9am&nbsp;for SIP on-campus session, whereby I will meet my CP and LO. I don't know how i overslept till so bad that I woke up at 10.30am. By this time, I had 7 smses from my classmate&nbsp;and 1 missed call from Shawn.&nbsp;I panicked like mad at home and rushed. Took a quick bathe, dressed quickly and dashed out of house. I got&nbsp; on cab around 11.10am and reached school at 11.20am. I took lift to see my CP first. He was like very reluctant to see me cause I didn't come in the morning.&nbsp;He told me to go see my LO first.&nbsp;So I went to 5th floor to find my LO, but he wasn't in. Called him but he say went off already cause got another appointment. Went back to 6th floor to see my CP. He was angry, ask me why I never come.&nbsp;I told him I overslept. He will talk to my LO again the see how, whether can save me or not. Haiss. What a screwed morning.<br /><br />After that, went to cut hair at my usual place. Kengkee and Keagan accompanied me. They went Funan to play&nbsp;Halo 3 on Xbox 360,&nbsp;while I cut my hair.&nbsp;My hair is super damned short now, but my tail is getting longer. HAHA! &nbsp;Went to find them after that. Walked around Funan to see the prices of the external hard disk which I want to buy. Then, we went to see guitar at Peninsula Plaza and Bras Basah Complex. Browsed through a few guitars and I already have in mind what guitar to buy. haha! Walked to Suntec to take bus&nbsp;home. Me and Keagan went to airport for dinner while Kengkee went to work.</p><p>So that's about it on saturday. Blog again&nbsp;soon.<br />Adios.</p>"

"event","<p>Let's blog about what happened on Friday, 5th October 2007 (haha!).</p><p>Okay. So it was planned like 1 week before the actual date. Cause he said his off day will be on Friday, Oct 5th. But I pretended not to remember it's his birthday. And so like literally planned his birthday celebration-cum-weekly dinner at Fish &amp; Co. Glass House.<br /><br />Supposedly wanted to make a&nbsp;reservation but the person says no bookings for weekends. So, it's a walk-in dinner. .</p><p>Apple baked him her famous(haha!)&nbsp;oreo cheescake. Met Shawn on MRT and waited for Apple at Dhoby Ghaut. Walked to Fish &amp; Co. to get tables. At first, I was afraid there will not be enough tables cause it was damn packed, and&nbsp;considering there's 9 of us. But luckily, there&nbsp;are and our tables are in this VIP room. Woo! And I told the person to keep the cake for us first.<br /><br />Met Kannan, Sharyl and Woonyah outside the Fish &amp; Co. Quite surprised cause Kannan said they were at Plaza Sing. Then, the person called us to go in as our tables are ready. Went in and talked crap somemore while waiting for birthday boy to arrive with Cheryl. Woonyah gave me my belated birthday present, a photocard with her birthday wish at the back. So sweet la the pics! It is really priceless! Thanks Woonyah! :)'</p><p>Ordered our food when Kengkee and Cheryl arrived cause everyone was starving already. haha! I ate a New York Fish &amp; Chips, while the others ate a total of 3 Seafood Platter for Two; Cheryl shared with Kengkee, Apple &amp; Shawn, Kannan &amp; Sharyl. Woonyah didn't eat, so did Gerald cause he got sore throat.<br /><br />Kengkee was quiet throughout. Emo on his birthday. HAHA! Our surprised almost backfired cause he kept standing, walking, and looking outside the glass window of our VIP room. But nonetheless, he still got surprised, not by us but by the Fish &amp; Co. staffs. Interestingly, they have their own ways to celebrate birthdays for their customers.<br /><br />So, Kengkee was made to stand on the chair, hold a sparkle in his hand, while the Fishy people(that's what they call themselves) gave him a birthday cheer. We also sang him a birthday song.&nbsp;He was made to blow the candle on the cake while standing on the chair, but he cannot bend down to blow. Took a lot of tries before he finally succeeded in blowing the candle off. After that, went back into the room, ate the cake and off we went. Sharyl and Woonyah left for home, while the rest off us hanged around. Shawn left soon after.<br /><br />The remaining few of us -&nbsp;Me, apple, kengkee, kannan gerald and cheryl - went to Giraffe to slack. The ambience was good like those rich people's place. I only ordered mango juice cause didn't feel like drinking the mocktail. The lady who took our order is very CUTE can? OMG la! And i kept turning around to look at her. By the way, she's a Malay. And there are a lot of malays working there. Maybe I'll go there some day for a drink again. *grins*<br /><br />All of us went off around 12am plus. Kannan, Kengkee and Cheryl cabbed home. Gerald took NR 7. Oh. There's this service, 6N, which goes directly to SengKang from PS.&nbsp;Woohoo! I can sense more late nights&nbsp;in town soon and cheaper&nbsp;fares to go home! So,&nbsp;I sent Apple home first&nbsp;before&nbsp;going&nbsp;home. Quite fun walking at 2am plus. Nobody and not much cars on the road. Should take more long walks at night alone. HAHA!</p>"

"event","<p><font color=""#808080"">I was feeling damn fucked up after dinner just now.&nbsp;And it's all because of my sis. Stupid.</font></p><p><font color=""#808080"">She was complaining about my room being messy la, clothes everywhere la, this la, that la, bla bla bla. So&nbsp;I told her that's my room. It's my choice how I want it to be.&nbsp;Messy or neat, MY&nbsp;choice. She continued blabbering to my</font> <font color=""#808080"">mum&nbsp;that she's gonna&nbsp;clean my room&nbsp;one day when&nbsp;I'm away. I told her straight to her face:</font> <font color=""#ff0000"" size=""4""><strong>NO!<br /><br /></strong><font color=""#000000"" size=""2""><font color=""#808080"">She wasn't happy with me. Puzzling right, considering it's my room and I'm just telling her no need to help me clean. I can do it myself. Because she always don't let&nbsp;people into her room. So I feel it's just right that I do the same to her. Then she said,<br /></font><br /><font color=""#ff0000"">Sis:</font> <font color=""#808080"">I want to look for the board games in your room. I want to play with Mum.<br /></font><font color=""#0000ff"">Me:</font> <font color=""#808080"">Whatever things you take from my room, confirm you will say it's yours</font>.<br /><font color=""#ff0000"">Sis:</font> <font color=""#808080"">Like what things?</font><br /><font color=""#0000ff"">Me</font>: <font color=""#808080"">My alarm clock, my Nike necklace. Now it's all&nbsp;your self-proclaimed belongings.<br /></font><font color=""#ff0000"">Sis:</font>&nbsp;<font color=""#808080"">Aiya, you don't always talk about the past can? Old story still want to say.<br /></font><font color=""#0000ff"">Me</font>:&nbsp;<font color=""#808080"">Old story? It's my stuffs okay! i have the&nbsp;right to talk about it!<br /></font><font color=""#ff0000"">Sis:</font>&nbsp;<font color=""#808080"">Whatever!<br /></font><font color=""#0000ff"">Me</font>:&nbsp;<font color=""#808080"">See.. That's the point.&nbsp;You dunno what to say already then say 'whatever'.<br /></font><font color=""#ff0000"">Sis:</font>&nbsp;<font color=""#808080"">Ahh! Whatever! You go sit with your chinese friends la! Mix with them and now you become like this.</font><br /><font color=""#0000ff"">Me</font>:<font color=""#808080"">&nbsp;Super no link can?! But at least my chinese friends don't smoke unlike your malay friends!<br /></font><br /><font color=""#808080"">Cause of that last sentence, she threw the plates onto the sink, breaking a bowl. I know I'm right but my mum keep siding her. Then I told her,<br /></font><br /><font color=""#0000ff"">Me</font>:&nbsp;<font color=""#808080"">You see.. We argue but Mum sides you. And you still say she don't love you la, treat you bad la.<br /></font><font color=""#ff0000"">Sis:</font>&nbsp;<font color=""#999999""><font color=""#808080"">Whatever!</font><br /></font><br /><font color=""#808080"">So I walked out of the kitchen, never talk to my mum, dad and sis. Felt so fucked up! Argh!<br />I'm soooo not gonna talk to them for these few days. See what my mum will do.</font><br /><br /><font color=""#ff0000"" size=""5""><strong><u>I DON'T FUCKING CARE!<br />I DON'T FUCKING GIVE A DAMN!</u></strong></font></font></font></p>"

"event","<p>Well.. Just now I went to Compass Point to top-up my EZ-Link card. On the way home, I dropped by Prima Deli to buy chocolate waffles home. There was this malay auntie at the counter and taking orders. So I ordered in Malay. But she kept talking in English. I thought nothing of it cause maybe they have to converse in English at all times.<br /><br />Here's the conversation:<br /><font color=""#c0c0c0"">(Note: Auntie speaking in English. Me in Malay.)</font><br /><br /><font color=""#ff0000"">Auntie:</font> Hello. Your order please.<br /><font color=""#0000ff"">Me:</font> Makcik, dua chocolate waffles. (Auntie, two chocolate waffles.)<br /><font color=""#ff0000"">Auntie:</font> Ok.<br /><br />So she put the batte onto the pan. When the waffles were ready and she was spreading the chocolate on the waffles, she suddenly looked up and talked to me.<br /><br /><font color=""#c0c0c0"">(Note: Auntie still&nbsp;speaking in English. Me in Malay.)</font><br /><font color=""#ff0000"">Auntie:</font> You malay ah?<br /><font color=""#0000ff"">Me:</font> Yes<br /><font color=""#ff0000"">Auntie:</font> *smiles*. OK.<br /><font color=""#0000ff"">Me:&nbsp;</font>Kenapa? Tak nampak macam melayu ke?&nbsp;(Why? I don't look like malay?)<br /><font color=""#ff0000"">Auntie:</font> *smiles*. No. You look like <strong><u><font color=""#993366"" size=""5"">Myanmar</font></u></strong> people.<br /><font color=""#0000ff"">Me:</font> Laughs.<br /><br />At that point of time, I didn't know what to say so I just laughed. Took my waffles, made payment and walked off.<br />On the way home, I was thinking ""How in the blue hell the auntie&nbsp;thinks that I'm a Burmese?"" Maybe because of my hair, cause i didn't style it after my bath. HAHA!</p>"

"event","<p>Okay.&nbsp;I watched President's Star Charity just now. Since there's nothing much to do, apart from watching tv, therefore I'm blogging now. :)<br /><br />I woke up like at freaking 5pm in the afternoon! What the hell la.&nbsp;SIP is&nbsp;beginning to take&nbsp;its toll on me, with lack of sleep and hard labour at work. This is like once-in-a-while-14-hours-of -sleep kind of thing, so I feel it's okay. I needed that rest and my beauty sleep.<br /><br />Well, this year's PSC was quite good, with Musical Extravaganza as the theme. However, there were some performances which were quite below-par. Surprisingly, a lot of people still continued to donate after the NKF issue. But, nonetheless, these donations are for the needy ones such as the Down Syndrome patients, HIV-positive, Cerebral Palsy, etc.&nbsp;I really hope that all the donations do go to those needy people.</p><p>Oh ya, talking about PSC, Shauna Simon is really cute la! She performed an item, Fried Rice Paradise,&nbsp;with the 'Live The Dream' contestants and also&nbsp;Dick Lee. I must say she really look young eventhough she's 26 this year. Maybe is because of her small and petite frame which makes her look young and cute. If she was a few&nbsp;years' younger, I will definitely go&nbsp;after her! I'm serious! haha! Anyway, all the best for Live The Dream participants. ;)<br /><br />Moving on, I'll blog about what happened on Friday and Saturday.<br /><br /><font color=""#0000ff""><u><strong>Friday (28.09.07)</strong></u></font><br />Ended work at 5.30pm as usual. Supposedly, meeting my primary school friends for dinner. However, they cancelled it at the last minute cause only 2 of them free. So I went to find Cheryl at her office which was only a few streets down.&nbsp; Walking halfway, it rained heavily so i stopped under a building for 15 mins waiting for the rain to subside. In all, took around 45 mins to reach Cheryl's office. After that, we proceeded to Eunos MRT to meet Gerald and head down to&nbsp;Changi Airport to meet KengKee, Apple, Shawn for dinner. Ate at T1 staff canteen, we all bullied Shawn to buy food for us cause he got airport staff pass. HAHA! Keagan and Fuad came soon after to join us.</p><p>After dinner, we skytrain-ed to T2 and went to the viewing mall to slack.&nbsp;Gerald, Apple, Fuad, Keagan and Shawn&nbsp;played the thumb (dumb) game,&nbsp;Cheryl played her DS, while me and KengKee ate the muffins which Cheryl bought for us. Yummy Yummy muffins! Left airport around 11.30pm, took bus home.<br /><br /><font color=""#0000ff""><strong><u>Saturday (29.09.07)<br /></u></strong></font>Worked from 9am-2pm at the new warehouse, help them set-up the tables and stuffs. Reached home around 3.15pm and bathed.&nbsp;By 4pm, i was&nbsp;at MRT waiting for Apple, cause we&nbsp;meeting Bryan, KengKee, Cheryl and Gerald at town. Waited for like 20 mins before she finally appeared. Train-ed to Somerset cause they all were at Heeren. Waled around at Heeren then Bryan had to leave. We proceeded to Taka, Gerald's turn to leave as he had to attend a friend's wedding dinner ar Farrer Park. The 4 of us went to Kinokuniya to look at books, then went to have dinner at he foodcourt. Had this chocolate eclair thing for dessert, which was quite sinful cause it's very chocolatey. haha.<br /><br />Walked to Plaza Singapura cause we all felt sinful after eating the chocolatey dessert. Dropped by Esprit, and went to Centrepoint cause KengKee wanted to go toilet. Then, Cheryl' slippers snapped. In the end we helped her to find a suitable slipper to buy. Robinson's was very expensive. So she gave up and we walked down some more and she bought her slipper at this cheap shop la. Reached PS, and took train home.</p>"

"event","Okay, so I had another strange dream.  This time me and kitty are at an AFI concert. Were in the crowd.  Its the hugest show theyve ever played.  Were trying to get pictures of the band, but its just really hard.  
All of a sudden we are backstage.  The venue turns into this giant ricketty barn in the middle of some English rolling hills countryside.  There is a terrible wet and windy thunderstorm.  We are on this strange rafters, balcony thing, and laying over the wood watching the show.  After every song all the roadies come racing out with sticks to shut these shutter doors between the crowd and the stage.  We are in front of two and they scream at us to shut them fast.  So we do.  Im afraid of heights so i dont race fast enough and the yell at me more.  I end up shutting the door and it throws me into this storage area part of the rafter.  All of a sudden this guy says, ""don't worry, this place is built strong nothing will make it fall, unless its struck by lightning of course"".  Its thundering and lightning right outside so I'm a little worried.  
Turns out as soon as we get a good look at this guy, who happens to be AFI's smarmy disgusting, leisure suit clad booker, It's Rod Stewert.  I swear.  He has the fluffy blond mullet and everything.  Hes recounting his glory days.  how he and his band used to throw out prizes to his crowd of tickets laced with various drugs.
He then in mid show, leaves because he says he has a better off, and a new lead....at Studio 54!  then the lightning flashes brighter, and whole entire barn starts to violently shake and i wake up!"

"event","I was the swedish teacher and it was the first day of class.  We were all standing outside this fancy cathedral building introducing ourselves. I said ""i guess we should all introduce each other does anyone have any experience with swedish""  someone raised their hand and spoke but i didnt here them cause a girl came to talk to me telling me that Morgon liked me in her class last year.  So i didnt hear the first thing one of my students said.  I was trying to play it all cool, like hey I'm one of you kind of a teacher
So then i though, lets play a game to loosen everyone up.  The game was called, ""Purple banana"" and a little girl materialized and starting singing ""purple banana"" over and over again, and we all had to dance to this in a circle and all over.  Then she yelled ""stop!"" and we all had to freeze.  One student didnt though.  He slipped and fell in the mud and splashed the entire front of my shirt with it.   He was also dressed as a monk or priest, in robes.  I said ""father...tsk tsk.""  We then laughed and continued the game.  He also had glasses and a little tattoo of a dove and heart and crossbones on his neck.  it was old school flash style.  I then woke up!"

"event","I went to the Adicts last night.  They were absolutely amazing.  It was like being at a carnaval.  They opener band, The Skulls had this whole pirate theme, playing It's a Pirates Life for Me and dressing up.  They even played a Johnny Cash cover, I walk the line!
When the Adicts came on it was wonderful. First we had to wait like an hour for some reason though and some giant fat disgusting sweaty stupid drunk slob was screaming obsenities the entire time, but no one would tell him to shut up cause he was so big and completely drunk and dangerous.  Everyone was drunk cause it was all the smelly gutter punks of Seattle together in one place at one time.  The show was packed and sold out.
The opening thing for the Adicts was the theme song to A Clockwork Orange, then they all came on dressed as Droogs, and started playing the British National Anthem.  Then....Oh my frogs...Then Monkey the singer came on.  dressed in a rainbow of colour.  Shining and bright. With a white face and full cabaret music and his funny droog hat.  Sort of the Joker version of Alex.
With the first song, he came out and sprayed the crowd with confetti.  Throughout the entire thing he had all kinds of suprises.  He had balloon animals and balloons.  He had balls, he had novelty flying discs.  He had cards he shot to the crowd.  he had more glitter, water guns, silly stringer, streamers.  Everything!  It was such a good time.  Just plain fun.  The crowd was the rowdiest I had ever experienced either!
They played all the wonderful songs, opening and closing with Viva la Revolution!  They played a super long encore with costume change.  It was a very long and super entertaining set.  I would love to see them again.  By far and away one of if not the best (AFI excluded)  concerts i have ever been to!  ten stars and six thumbs up!  yaey"

I woke up at three and thought I had to go work, and was too tired to figure out I didnt have to wake up for three more hours.  I did that every hour until six too!

Yaey! 
I'm feeling creative right now.  I'm really excited to do a portrait of Marta and I want to do a painting or perhaps (if I'm lucky and my muse stays) a new series based on Alice in Wonderland.  I've become very interested in that lately.  I have to read the books first before I start on that though.  It wouldn't be right if I didnt.  Perhaps I'll do a few more in the bone series as well.  And soon I'll have slides of that series and I'll have them on the computer!  yaey!"

The singer, Johnny Pettybone has an amazing stage presence,  jumping into the crowd, running around, hanging from rafters.  Good stuff.  The guitarists also were amazing.  almost a touch of Iron Maiden in the riffage, but very good and very hardcore.  The drumset.   Oh god the drumset, almost worthy of Nicko McBrain.  Huge, it had the rack, two bass drums, two floor toms, and all kinds of symbols.  The drummer was a bit silly though, good, but silly.  All in all a great experience.  Marta is supposed to do something with Pettybone next week!  Exciting!  I got a sticker, but alas, no Himsa panties for me."

My kitty bought AFI-Sing the Sorrow.  I'm so excited for her.  Its the music of my soul.  How can I even begin to describe what this band and album do to me, what they are to me, how they melt my heart so completely?  It's beauty, pure almost religious beauty.  The lyrics are so desperate, so lost, but the music conveys this hopeful spirit.  As Davey tears himself down, the music brings him up, carries him on its shoulders.  A masterpiece. Words cannot and should not be able to describe the power of this band."

"event","I can't remember
if I layed awake all night 
dreaming of sleep
or slept all night 
dreaming of lying awake  
The night is a series of fragmented images 
tossing and turning 
the rain screaming through my window 
It is morning now 
the light has returned 
and the sun struggles with overcast skies  
The rain retreats 
this day favouring blue
But I remain
tossing and turning"

I wish the picture was a bit bigger, but that's okay!  
I went running with Marta for the first time today.  It was wet and disgustingly windy, but oh well.  We're extreme I guess!  Pop open the Mountain Dew!"

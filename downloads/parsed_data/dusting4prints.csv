And just in case things were too easy, he's also being accused of carting off Thomas. Kid's tryin' to give me an ulcer, I swear....<br /><br />Other people/witnesses/pains in the ass: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Lyon: Check. Nice girl, what the hell is she getting caught up in this mess for? <span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">Poor kid got in the way of Yuber...</span>Confirms that Yuber is a crazy bastard and attacked her for really no reason...at least, none I can find yet. Keep digging, Yuber's a nutcase, but his behavior does sometimes have a purpose. Mentioned running into Luca after Yuber attacked her and he said he'd 'take care of Yuber'. Man, I don't like that, that's for sure.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Sialeeds: Need to find. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Kyle: Gotta find him, too.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Roget: Overheard talking with that Matildian knight, Camus, and sounds like he met up with Roy and his 'bandits' as Roy said. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Nash: Need to find him, too. Man, what is it with people not bein' around for me to spy on?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Geddoe: Can vouch for Roy's whereabouts during Thomas' disappearance and is a character witness for the kid. Seems like a good guy to keep Roy with, but he's hiding something....<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Luca: .....find him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Yuber: *SIGH*......need to find him too, damn it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Belcoot: Gotta find out why he got added onto Luca's list of people...and why he got stabbed in the gut. Reports say he's kind of the knightly type...probably went and confronted Blight, the idiot. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Shoon: Ransom note!<br /><br />Notes: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Kidnapping Thomas: Geddoe provides an alibi and there's no motive/evidence to show he did it. Luca's word against Roy's. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Letting Yuber <span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">sadjr8e321*@&amp;</span> out of jail: Roy's word against Luca's, but no hard evidence on either side. Has a partial alibi of being in Vinay del Zexay, but was present in the castle at the time Yuber was let out. According to reports, Roy saw the cell empty and Luca was present. Suspicious....but if it was Luca, why let Yuber out? Why would Yuber work with Blight? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -New development!: Ransom note found....although that's one crappy note. (Who the hell writes that kind of stuff, anyway? That kid better hope he can tell me he was with someone all afternoon while this thing was put up. ) On the actual note, it says he's working with Yuber, who's guarding Thomas...now that I can believe, and Yuber's working with whoever wrote the note, so find Yuber...find Thomas. I don't like that part about Cecile, though. Gotta find out who was last with her, and if she's okay.&nbsp; <span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">Stars above, I hope that kid is all right, she doesn't deserve that...</span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />To do:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Really gotta find Luca. Goddamnit. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Where the hell is Yuber now, anyway?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Find out if anyone saw the note before that other kid did... (Shoon, is that his name? Add him to the list of people to chat with).<br /><br /><br />Ugh....maybe Kanakan needs a dishwasher.<br /><br />Reports: <br />-<a href=""http://dusting4prints.livejournal.com/1349.html#cutid1"">Lyon</a><br />-<a href=""http://dusting4prints.livejournal.com/1585.html#cutid1"">Geddoe</a><br />-<a href=""http://rockaxepimp.livejournal.com/4986.html#cutid1"">Roget</a><br />-<a href=""http://bad-twin.livejournal.com/9741.html#cutid1"">Roy</a><br />-<a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/suiko_rpg/1083921.html#cutid1"">Ransom note</a>&nbsp;"

So there I was, going about my business, working on some cases for the good people here, and the next thing I know I'm on a boat to some forsaken island down by old Scarlet Moon! I tell ya, those Kanakan traders, they're a crafty lot, I ended up doing dishes for them for 5 weeks! 5 weeks! These hands aren't meant for dishes, ya know. 

Suffice to say, Richmond here has to eat some mighty big crow and admit defeat in his expedition. I'm just happy to be back in Dunan...or I was until I heard all this racket about people in this castle. Seems no matter where I got, the Grasslands are the talk of the town. Can't blame a guy for being curious, right? <s>Although some of those Toran bastards tried. Sheesh, no one's got a sense of humor anymore....</s>

So, what's new?"

I knew I shouldn't have bought that map off of that guy in Tinto, great miners, but above ground...sheesh. I think Sasuke said something about being teleported 18 years into the future, but he didn't say anything about it being now! You guys gotta let people know about this kinda stuff! Important information like that should be shared, yanno. 

Anyhow, so I've found a bit out about this place and the people in it. You're all an interesting bunch, eh? I've heard there's people back from the dead, from hundreds of years in the past (no wonder there's all those Island Nation kids up here) and even Luca Blight's kicking around somewhere! <s>although I'm not too sad not to see him, to tell ya the truth.</s>

So how about it, kids? You want to know something, just ask Richmond here and he'll figure it out. 


(OOC: I'm basing Richmond's information off of what's been documented publicly, like as in logs, and what's been said during discussions on threads, as in rumors...so he's bound to get things wrong. XD Go ahead and ask him and see what he gets right, he can also take new cases as they come up.

I was following a lead on my newest case some crazy kid who wanted to know about a rare butterfly collector.

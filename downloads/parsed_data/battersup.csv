and I told you I was nervous and feeling lonely 
but I bit my lip and you said yes 
and I thought of how beautiful the night would be 
and I thought maybe we could drive around talking about your town 
or we could just stay at home and I could win over acting cool 
just like real romance.

-that song reminds me of the best times in my life



Im at a weird stage in my life right now, and i dont know really how to feel about it all. maybe its the winter maybe its just how it is. i miss some people in my life a tremendous amount and at this point im ready to do anything i can to take my life back from the stage its in right now. i feel like im in a prison with no bars. 

I recently went back home for a few days and it was awesome, i had no worries, and the weather was awesome. i hated driving away, down the street to head off to nebraska. 

i hate having no solid friends here in nebraska that i could just spill my guts to without the chance of it coming back at me. 

im going to move away from nebraska when i get out but sara wants to stay, so we will see what happens. 

I just feel like there is so much more for me to do in life than live in nebraska, i want to travel and i want to see the beach again, and i want to see the mountains again. i hate this place. its a life sucker.

omaha blows dick. 

i want to live near friends and have great times again, not be stuck in these miserable doldrums im in now. 

and the whole last year has blown, which is why i didnt post anything. ill make this one better, even if it means doing things i dont want to but are neccessary."

I havent really dont too much lately im saving up to go to the frankfurt intl tattoo convention, Im thinking of getting my chest piece done, Ive been thinking about it a lot, as to what I want to get. I finally came up with a solid design, but im not sure if ill get it now or now. 

Im coming home in June for a whole month, well, Ill be near home for a month, hopefully ill be staying with emilie for a while, which will be fun. 

Then ill be home for 12 days in chesapeake, and hopefully ill go to some good shows and shit like that.

I want to go to sleep right now. 

I hope all my friends are doing good right now.

People change so much over a relatively short span of time, its crazy, someone I was so close with a couple of years ago, is like a total different person, like I wouldnt even want to know her anymore. Shes just completely different. oh well. life i guess.

I miss a lot of people, in particular, emilie p,joey, chelsea, sean collins, russ, cory, marshe, andy, and pdex. 

i cant wait to go back home."

"event","So I went and saw Agnostic front and Death Before Dishonor, last night in Munich germany, and it was awesome. Death Before Dishonor stole the show though, and were really awesome dudes too. AF either had really crap equipment or they were sick or something, because they sounded like crap, but whatever its cool, and it was awesome to finally see them live, they played a bunch of new stuff that I wasnt really diggin on but they played some really good songs too, crucify was awesome. But, yeah thats about all ive done lately. 

I also went to amsterdam the other week too, that place is so shady. Everything bad in the world flocks to amsterdam. SO SHADY. It was still really awesome to go though. One more place marked off the list. 

Hope everyone is doing good. 

Take care"

"event","Dude, Valentine's Day sucks a lot. 

Switzerland doesn't though, and if you snowboard or partake in any winter type things then I suggest you go there to check it out.

Anyways here how the trip goes

Monday 9:00A.M- Leave for Switz. but not before I get a bottle of Jack Daniels to enjoy along the ride, little did I know that when I start drinking Jack Daniels, my judgment of how much I put in my cup varies a little bit, and when I say this I mean I was filling my cup halfway with JD and halfway with coke. 

Monday 11:00A.M- Try to cross Swiss border whilst hanging out of the car salivating and about to puke on border guard, at this time Mr. Bottle of Jack Daniels was almost empty a good 7/8ths gone. I ended up not puking but I was able to succesfully piss all over Switzerland while we were stopped at the border. Got back into car and passed out. 

Monday Night- Alright Day one was over and what to do in Switzerland at this time, how about Hooters. Hooters. Hooters sucks. but I went anyways and had a tall glass of FANTA it rocks. 
Then I went to the CASINO and played roulette for a good 3 hours, and lost about 200 dollars then I hit 0 and made it all back and then some, thats when I decided to quit playing and I went back and went to sleep. 

Tuesday 8:00A.M- Got up and Theo, John and I went and got ready and caught the bus to the train station that takes you up to the tops of different mountains, the one we rode the first day was call manlichen or something along those lines, and the gondola that takes you from the train station in manlichen to the top of manlichen is holds like 61 people, 61. it was ridiculous and if anyone has ever been to europe, people are wicked rude on the lifts (i.e, pushing,shoving,and squeezing right in front of you, we had to like shove people out of the way that were trying to get in front of us or else we would've been sitting there all day. well we finally made it up there and the first run of the day was pretty sweet, in switzerland they have slopes that run right down into the middle of town, like along the streets of the city, so we rode from the top of the mountian all the way down to the bottom of town, this took like 2 hours which was pretty awesome when you can snowboard for 2 hours with minimal stopping. We also found some sweet backcountry stuff, and there was like 4 feet of fresh unridden powder. It was gnarly. We only rode into town once, the other runs we just did for a little ways to the last gondola to the top.

Tuesday Night: Didnt do much Tuesday night because I was so sore I really wasnt in the mood to drink, plus I was still feeling the effects of Monday morning. So I slept for a while until John and Theo came back plastered. It was hilarious. Eventually, they settled down for a quiet night. 

Wednesday Morning: Woke up and did all the same as Tuesday but this time we rode a different mountian and its name was something like klein schlidig or something like that. Holy shit this mountain was awesome, it was so much better than the previous day. The view from the slope was amazing and the snow was amazing. There were parts that like went through the forest in between trees and shit, it was so beautiful. It was a lot more fun too, it was so much steeper and faster than the day before. This slope also led into another town, where we took the train back up to the top, it was tight. I had so much fun that day, everyone I went with was quality people, and we were all cracking jokes the whole day, I wish I had everything we said on video so I could just put it on repeat. Anyways that was the last day we went on the mountain. 

Wednesday night: Wednesday night was filled with drunken humor and snow bashing, which was my friends erin and allisons idea that running into hills of snow, unbeknown-est what is underneath the snow actually making it protrude from the ground, was fun. So we all went and jumped in the snow and pushed each other in the snow and had an awesome time, until Levi landed on a fucking log sticking out of the snow and it jabbed into my fucking thigh. IT HURT A LOT. now I have a fat bruise on my thigh and it still hurts. But regardless it was still fun and I was drunk so I didnt really care at the time.

Thursday morning: Woke up at like 8 and headed back to germany, hungover and having to work in 6 hours. It sucked, but oh well. Fun was had by all."

<P><FONT size=2>Im still really excited to go back to the states, and spending quality time with quality people. I think im going to get an apartment in maryland, and find a job up there, probably 30-45 minutes away from baltimore. This summer i want to go on tour with dead ahead, and just travel around the states, with all those dudes, which, are quality people. I also want to go down to NC and spend some time with lathan. Which is one person i dont think i could do without in my life. I know i will have a blast with him in wilmington, maybe cory can come down too. I miss him too. So i think im getting everything in my life, the way i want it. Everything seems to be coming together at this point, i have a good amount of money saved up to where i can survive for a good 3 months without doing anything, but im sure ill have a job before then and be fully operational. I will also be a lot closer to the person i love. </FONT></P>

i cant wait to leave here. i miss everyone back home. 
emilie in particular. i love you and i miss you a ton. 

if everything works out as planned i will be out of here mid march so about 3 months, knock on wood. 

other than that things are going normal i guess, i work and hang out at home. i found some time the other day to play in a little poker game with a 50 dollar buy in. i walked away with a 100 so not too bad, i played better the more drunk i got. strange. but thats about it. ive also been thinking about what else im getting on my arm for my sleeve and so far, its gonna be an old school skateboard and one of those keyboard guitars, because they are awesome and i had one when i was little and i thought it was the greatest thing on earth. 

i cant wait to be done here. and back there. i love you"

"event","okay, so im sitting here in Dover airport, as i have been for the past 5 hours. ill be in germany way too soon for my liking. But thats not the reason for this post, the reason is this. friendship dedication post. i know they are a dime a dozen, but my friends arent. if i leave you out it doesnt mean i dont care but these people have had an impact on the way i live my life and make me the person i am today. 

Lathan- I dont have enough words to describe how much you mean to me, youve been there through everything and i love you for it. One of those ""once in a lifetime friends"". Hanging out with you was probably the most fun ive had in over a year and i definately will stay in wilmington with you for while when i get back.

Cory- My brother, even though you act like a meathead sometimes, you know ill always be there and i know you will always be there.i seriously love you like you were my flesh and blood kin. i had a great time with you and im sorry i didnt get to say goodbye but ill see you soon.

Joe- Wherever you go ill find you and hang out, i always have fun with and appreciate the fact that no matter what youll tell me the honest truth and that means so much. im really glad we got to hang out when i was home it really meant a lot. 

Chelsea- One of the best friends ive ever had, i can talk to you about anything and youll tell me if im being an idiot and most of the time i dont listen and it ends up being that you were right in the first place. (you know what im talking about..2 yrs ago). But i know youll always be there and that means so much. 

Emilie P- you've had such a large impact on me as a person, it may not seem like it but when im around you it makes me want to improve myself. I cant say how happy it made me to see you last week, i seriously had such a great time, i think i smiled more in those few days than i have in the past 2 years, at that point last week i was so content with life that i couldnt ask for anything else, i had everything i wanted. and i love you and adore you. 


so thats it ill be on a plane to germany in a little while, and its back to the grind. I will see you all soon, because hopefully if everything works out i will be out of the air force within the next few months. and if anyone is thinking about joining the military, please dont. it sucks, given i have seen half of the world and i am very thankful its given me the chance to do so, i dont think its worth putting up with all the bullshit, depression, and over-all longing to be with the ones you love when they are so far away. 

i love you all with my heart and soul. 
take care and ill see you all soon."

"event","so yeah, the past two days were amazing, i was so glad i got to hang out with emilie. She is amazing, and i had such a great time, im really really sad that she left, because i havent seen her in almost a year, but im glad i got to see her at all. She drove four hours from maryland which i cant believe she would drive that far to see me. fuck i shouldnt have let her leave. 

the show last night and the night before were both good shows, i had a great time, and it was good seeing everyone there, i missed everybody a lot. 

i hung out with lathan today after emilie left, and we had so many good conversations during the day, and remembered all the good times weve had in the past, it made me feel so nostalgic, and it made me happy and sad at the same time.

Maybe I should be subtle or maybe I should be more pure but I think we should talk about what we were going through and I wonder what it would be like if we had kept up that aversion and maybe kept listing all the people that we hated but isn't it ironic how you still have ideals and I still have nothing? and now I'm hoping that you'll change so we can see straight some day."

"event","so yeah, i am going to switzerland in like 5 days. im excited about it, ive been reading about peoples survival stories, and there is some amazing shit that people have overcome, its just ridiculous. things that must take so much bravery and courage to overcome, and i try to think about how i would react in a similar situation. i honestly dont think i could do half of the stuff some people have overcome, but i guess its totally different when youre in the situation. its just really fascinating material. to me anyways. 

other than that, ive been working mids which is 1130 to 730 in the morning, which is not gnarly at radical at all. my sleeping schedule is totally fucked all the time. i just think its impossible to adjust to working a schedule like that. ill get over it though. its just weird at first i guess.

im still really excited about going home in november, i know i will have fun. And i have a date when i get home which is totally gnarly. im so excited. honestly. 

i love you guys."

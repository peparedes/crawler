"event","i have come to the conclusion that i really dont allow myself to fail. its not really an option..

i used to think that the reasons why i never really broke down (fully) was bc i wasnt allowed to (with all the issues with my dad and what not) anyway i think its not really my parents fault i dont break down. i dont allow myself to have a sad/crying day type of thing. just no time

well the teacher today said that alot of us was going to fail this class he mentioned it before but reminded us today bc it was such a hard class and well into alot of hard things. and well that EMT isnt for everyone, and its like weird that mustered up some feelings with me bc i wanted to well i dont know i mean i dont care if its not for me i cant fail. geeze!

ok so yeah i am a bit overwhelmed here, i realized i had several personal things to do and well prepare myself and it would have been better to do it before class started, its only the second week and we already covered9 very well not all very difficult but fairly difficult and 2 very difficult chapters its so fast paced"

"event","so my father is extremely sick, yet again. and well its not that i am not concerned but i am very angry. the docs (2 of them) told him to admit himself into the hospital, and he doesnt want to go.. too stubborn i guess too full of pride (sounds like someone else eh?) but the thing is is that now my mom and i (mostly me) have to wait.. and wait and sit here to wait to see... if it gets worse we can call ems, if it gets better we have diverted a tragedy. but it would be so much less stressful for myself and my mother if he just went in right now (like the fucking docs want him to go in) so that well we dont have to wait and worry and just constantly look at him to make sure he is breathing... do you know how fucking annoying and hard and scary that is.. to have to study someones body to make sure its moving?

so in addition to all this bullshit. and this i dont know stress that i think can be avoided. well i get phone calls from everyone! katie, jen, clark, linda and aunt kris... to tell me what? that they think he should go into the hospital. well i cant make him go.. and it sucks bc i probably could have if he and i never got into that fight. i might have been able to tell him to go and be firm but now my voice doesnt matter to him. so i feel at fault for what.... being sensitive i guess. it sucks! all this sucks! 

that and well my aunt kris thinks he is going to die today. like she sounded worried, asked what she could do (of course she is in medford so its not like she can do anything) but yeah she just asked out of the blue.. ""do you think he is going to die?"" 

ok so this whole venting thing sounds like i am being selfish as well and that i dont really care, but the thing is is that i do care. i hate this and i hate him being sick but i cant do anything about it. i cant help at all other than just watch and wait. and well yeah its just frustrating that i get these calls from people i guess they think i should do more? or say more or something more and i cant. its frustrating feeling so helpless and well so angry i kinda feel well ok no kinda but i do feel very guilty for being so angry about it."

"event","today i went to the doc, to find the things i didnt want to find out, dont ask i am not going to tell you, i just wanted to vent a little. but yeah... soemtimes its amazying how much things can get so wrong so quickly..

i am bored with my life, and well its not that there is nothing going on but its like how pain and heartache can be so dull at times. you know like it snot really exciting or happy its just this dull ache, thats what i feel. i try to hide it with my shoping i have been doing, and well the reading (been reading alot more than usual) but i dont know what will fix it. i stare blankly at the tv, or i just go through the motions with other things..

like today (for example) i went to luby's with this lady that i watch (she is like grandma age) anyway we gop to eat, and i am just putting the food into me like routine, like i am not savoring any flavor, i dont even remember what i ate, or what i drank, just do what i should do. eat. and then.. what? nothing, just there running through the motions of life that i have to do. bc thats whats right. eat, drink, sleep.  throw in a shower or two and thats me. 

i used to sing in the shower, dance around the room with my kitty, chase her (ok i terorize my cat a bit much) anyway i used to skip, and hum and giggle. but it feels like thats a thing of the past. and i am rambling and nobody is reading and this is pointless. but i must continue..

for what? ok i am even bored with me. this is so blah, blah.. what a wonderful word, it means so much yet it means nothing at all. i am blah, this is blah, i feel blah. perfect it works in everything. i went to the store and blah... i bought blah... i feel blah about blah..  blah blah blah! i dont want to be blah anymore, i want to be exciting, i want to be captivating, i want to be that type of girl that you look at and cant take your eyes off of her, like she just is amazing. why was i able to get everyone's attention in the past and enter a party and have people hang off of me? and now i blend in. i blend, i no longer stand out. blah.. again with the blahs."

"event","isnt it funny when something happens and before when we were younger this tore into me, this hurt me like nothing i have ever felt before. i was dead, my world was dead, everything was dead.. 

and now...

years later it comes back, does the same and what? it doesnt affect me? it seems even not worth mentioning. 

maybe i really did die that day long ago. or at least more of me did than i had thought 

just think its funny"

"event","so i watched passions of the christ today. yeah umm first off i didnt fall asleep so thats good (i usually fall asleep in the theatre) anyway so yeah i watched it. and if anything it made me question my faith even more (i am currently in the questioning phase) its horrible but yeah the horrible things they did to him.. and his father.. our God had the opportunity to stop it all along but didnt? i mean i dont get it.. i understand the theory of dieing for our sins.. but couldnt have God just accepted us sinning and not let someone go through so much pain bc we do it.. maybe i am not making sense but this religion thingie is really starting to get to me.. i spend hours a night reading the bible, and other um insperational books and i dont get it.. why doesnt it just come to me?

all this movie really made me feel was bad for jesus but for his father.. well i dont know.. i mean like a relationship with someone that suffered for me is well realistic but with someone or something or whatever that let their son suffer.. its like i know my father.. even though he is weak or whatever if he saw someone beating me.. he would try to protect me. hell if i saw someone hurting someone i loved i would do whatever i could to make it stop.. 

ok so yeah i dont know then i came home and well i took a nap (bc i didnt sleep the night before) and well i had dreams about the beatings and the whippings.. like i dreamt about um that satan thingie comeing to get me bc i wasnt good enough.. i know i feel like i am aweful.. i have sinned alot... 
(sex before marriage, disobeying, lieing, being pregnant-- on two occasions, and well the worst thing.. i cant even bare to say..) i mean i dreamt that i was with vincent, and he hit me and i lied to everyone and said he didnt and then the devil came to get me.. that i reached a certain number of sins and well it was my limit.. 

maybe in my next entry i will go into more detail of my sins.. confess. um i guess more out loud. i know they are there, but i dont, well i keep them out of my head.. i pretend everything.. everything for me is a make-believe game of happiness and love.. 

oh and there i something in the bible that said something along the lines of we arent from this world and we wont ever feel like home.. that um.. wow i dont know exactly how it was worded.. but um yeah that we arent of this world. like we are of the other or something nevermind.. i will write about that later when i get it in my mind right..

i feel like i have been tested so many times.. again i should save that for another entry.. just giving myself a mental note.."

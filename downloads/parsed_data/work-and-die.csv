I'm now an IOP (Intensive Out Patient) group therapy in Jeffersonville, IN from 9-12 in the morning everyday for 4 weeks. I'm going into my 4th week right now. It's wild. Mostly people are 30-50 y/o who have ruined their lives from alcohol or drugs. There are some younger folks there, there an 18 y/o girl and boy and a 26 y/o women and me. That's as young as it goes... Heroine addicts, people who've lost EVERYTHING, alcoholics, you get the picture...

Work is good right now. I'm working my balls to the wall to try and get the promotions I need to support my new family...

About 12 of my buddies went to the Sounds of the Underground tour show at Waverly Hills a few months ago. Bands included: GWAR, Lamb of God, Shadows Fall, Behemoth, Chimaria, Job For a Cowboy, Darkest Hour, Goatwhore, Hatebreed, and others. The show was A-MAZ-ING! It will be the last show at Waverly Hills because the neighbors complained about the noise and whatnot. It was sweet none the less.

Life's pretty normal and we've figured that the baby is due around January 29th. That's it - good night!"

"event","&nbsp;Great news, I'm finally starting my working-class 40+/hr job a week at Discount Labels in New Albany. It'll be good to get this going and to stay busy. Just maybe it will keep me out of trouble. It's a warehouse job but I'm 100% ready to bust my ass to earn a living. All these years of part-time shitty-ass jobs have been boring and gave me WAY too much free time. The question is, is there a union and what kind is it?

My hours will be 3-11p.m. (2nd shift) so I won't have as much time to spend with Heather. I start at $9/hr but can move up to $22-26/hr in less than two years. That will be amazing.

I can see the changes I've made since I've got jail and trouble-making behind me now. I see that in February I'll have a brand new baby with my girlfriend and start an adult life. Getting married next summer is on the do list too...

My friends' band Buried Beneath Me is play at Uncle Pleasant's bar tonight at 7 in Louisville. If you're interested in a metal show, just give me a call. 972.2008.

Nothing else - maybe next time I'll have something entertaining to post. Cheers!"

Burns is one of the more vulnerable Senate incumbents, facing a tough challenge from Democrat Jon Tester.</p>
<p>He has drawn criticism in recent weeks for calling his house painter a ""nice little Guatemalan man"" during a June speech. Burns, whose re-election campaign is pressing for tighter immigration controls, also suggested that the man might be an illegal immigrant. The campaign later said the worker is legal.</p>
<p>Burns, 71, also had to apologize after confronting members of a firefighting team at the Billings airport and telling them they had done a ""piss-poor job,"" according to a state report. In July, the Hotshot crew had traveled 2,000 miles from Staunton, Va., to help dig fire lines for about a week around a 143-square-mile wildfire east of Billings.</p>
<p>At the campaign event with Bush, Burns talked about the war on terrorism, saying a ""faceless enemy"" of terrorists ""drive taxi cabs in the daytime and kill at night.""</p>
<p>Bush described Burns as a strong advocate for Montana farmers and families.</p>
<p>""In Washington, Senator Burns is a respected voice on the issues facing rural communities in Montana and across the nation,"" Bush told Burns supporters.</p>

Not that life is taking off and flying away or anything but it's at least moving in an&nbsp;foward motion.<br /><br />This girl, I can't get her out of my head. Last night was good, but I wish things wouldn't have been as awkward as a drunk talking to someone sober. I was still happy to see her there. At first I couldn't tell if it was her, but my buddy yelled her name and she looked; that put a smile on my face.<br /><br />and I'm heading home so Dad can show me how to use his big-ass mower he mows peoples lawns with. He's taking off a week because Tuesday he's going back to the doctor to get more tissue removed from his back to try and get the rest of the cancerous tissue... So I'm picking up all his different jobs on my days off. Things should go well.<br /><br />Picked up a burned copy of&nbsp;the new <strong>Muse </strong>cd, <strong>Black Hole And Revelations.</strong> I can say that's it's good but nothing totally mind blowing. I'd say&nbsp;what sets this album apart from the others are&nbsp;solid drums. I found myself enjoying he catchy dance-like beats. Like a mix between Rush/Joy Division/Metallica '84-'89/techno/some mariachi band. It seems the lyrics have gone to a higher pitch,or they're just more annoying. I know I boasted about these guys with their Absolution album, but this one has about 3 or 4 solid tracks that I can actually listen to. I think filling a song with high-pitched vocals is a waste, I'd give the album a 7.1.<br /><br />

Landers, an old man that's been doing landscaping work for a long time
for my family and business, funeral was today. He was 80. I'd only
spoke with him, maybe, a half-dozen times but still felt like I knew
him dearly. It makes me think of my funeral one day, hopefully in the
far far future. <br>

On the last passing my little sister went and hugged his wife and started crying. I could barely keep it together..<br>

Here is your horoscope

It's a good time to be ever the cockeyed optimist, no matter how unfortunate the circumstances may look on the surface. Your relentlessly upbeat -- but never saccharine -- attitude will be a self-fulfilling prophecy."

lately.<br>

I put some <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</span>
on my mp3 player today and was walking around outside work on my smoke
breaks. Let me tell you, today is the perfect day for their music, but
any day is really. There's this ledge/cliff thing I like to stand and
think on. Today, standing, listening to their song <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">'Providence'</span> took me back a little. What a beautiful song, I wish I'd had written it.<br>

Nile, Decapitated, With Passion, Hypocrisy, Raging Speedhorn </b>and<b> Soilent Green. </b>Wow, should be an excellent show..<br>
<br>
Last night I watched a show on History Channel about <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Edgar Cayce</span>.
I knew of him and that he was a prophet/psychic and what-not, but I'd
never heard anything really in-depth about him. After that show i need
to get any and all books about him. He makes me feel this sense, I
don't know what it is. Here's some links you should definately check
out in your free time:<br>

won't be in vain. Katy Davis and Sarah Carver's boyfriend Eric are

<H2>History</H2>
<P>After moving from Denmark, Mike Tramp meets guitarist Vito Bratta and decide to form a band. After meeting drummer <A class=new title=""Nicki Capozzi"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicki_Capozzi&amp;action=edit"">Nicki Capozzi</A> and bassist <A class=new title=""Felix Robinson"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Felix_Robinson&amp;action=edit"">Felix Robinson</A> the band was named White Lion.</P>
<P>White Lion was signed by a small label called <A class=new title=""Grand Slam records"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grand_Slam_records&amp;action=edit"">Grand Slam records</A> in <A title=""January 1985"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1985"">January 1985</A>. While recording the song <I>The Road to Valhalla</I>, both Capozzi and Robinson left the band. Nicki Capozzi was replaced by <A title=""Dan Spitz"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Spitz"">Dan Spitz</A>, and Felix Robinson was replaced by <A title=""James Lomenzo"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lomenzo"">James Lomenzo</A>. Within a month of joining, Dan Spitz left to become guitarist for <A title=""Anthrax (band)"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax_%28band%29"">Anthrax</A> and was replaced by former <A title=""Anthrax (band)"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax_%28band%29"">Anthrax</A> drummer <A class=new title=""Greg D'Angelo"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greg_D%27Angelo&amp;action=edit"">Greg D'Angelo</A>.</P>
<P>The band then finished their debut album, <I><A class=new title=""Fight to Survive"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fight_to_Survive&amp;action=edit"">Fight to Survive</A></I>, which was released on <A title=""November 9, 1985"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_9%2C_1985"">November 9, 1985</A>. A few months later, Grand Slam records went <A title=Bankrupt href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankrupt"">bankrupt</A>.</P>
<P>In <A title=1986 href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986"">1986</A>, White Lion, with a fictitious ""female"" member, had a brief part in the <A title=""Tom Hanks"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hanks"">Tom Hanks</A>/<A title=""Shelley Long"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Long"">Shelley Long</A> movie <I><A title=""The Money Pit"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Money_Pit"">The Money Pit</A></I>. Early in <A title=1987 href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987"">1987</A>, the band was signed by <A title=""Atlantic Records"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Records"">Atlantic Records</A>. By then, their debut album was out of print and extremely hard to find.</P>
<P>On <A title=""June 21"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_21"">June 21</A>, <A title=1987 href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987"">1987</A>, their second album, <A title=Pride href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride"">Pride</A>, was released (the same day as <A title=Keel href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keel"">Keel</A>'s <I>Keel</I> album, and Helix's <I>Wild in The Streets</I>) The first single from <I>Pride</I> was '<I>Wait/Don't Give Up</I>, released on <A title=""June 1"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_1"">June 1</A>, <A title=1987 href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987"">1987</A>. However, it took seven months before the song became a hit.</P>
<P>The <B>Pride</B> tour started in <A title=July href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July"">July</A> 1987 as White Lion opened for <A title=""Ace Frehley"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Frehley"">Ace Frehley</A>'s 80s band <I><A title=""Frehley's Comet"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frehley%27s_Comet"">Frehley's Comet</A></I>. In <A title=September href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September"">September</A> 1987, White Lion became the opening band for <A title=KISS href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS"">KISS</A> (who had just started their <B>Crazy Nights</B> tour).</P>
<P>White Lion spent the rest of 1987 on tour with KISS. In January <A title=1988 href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988"">1988</A> started opening for <A title=AC/DC href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC"">AC/DC</A> on their <B>Blow Up Your Video</B> tour.</P>
<P>While opening for AC/DC, the <I>Pride</I> album and <I>Wait</I> single finally charted. <I>Wait</I> hit #8 on the singles chart, while <I>Pride</I> stalled at #11 on the album chart.</P>
<P>In August 1988, the album's second single ""Tell Me"" stopped at #58. Around the time this single was released, White Lion played at the Ritz club in New York City. Like <A title=""Guns N' Roses"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns_N%27_Roses"">Guns N' Roses</A>, White Lion's show at the Ritz was filmed and later aired on MTV.</P>
<P>White Lion concluded the <I>Pride</I> tour by opening for <A title=Stryper href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stryper"">Stryper</A> from September 1988 to February 1989 during Stryper's <I>In God We Trust</I> tour. The ""Pride"" album's third single, <I>When The Children Cry,</I> made it to #3, making Pride one of about 18 hard rock albums to ever have multiple top 10 hits.</P>
<P>In August 1989, White Lion released their third album, ""Big Game"", a musically eclectic follow-up to ""Pride"" that featured the singles ""Little Fighter,"" ""Cry For Freedom,"" and a cover of <A title=""Golden Earring"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Earring"">Golden Earring</A>'s ""Radar Love."" As soon as the album went gold it slowly declined on the charts.</P>
<P>After 2 years of writing and recording, the new album, ""Mane Attraction,"" was released in 1991. The album failed to chart, following the last two albums. It barely received any airplay due to the recent <A title=Grunge href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunge"">Grunge</A> explosion. Greg D'Angelo and James Lomenzo soon left the band, but White Lion carried on with <A class=new title=""Tommy T-Bone Caradonna"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tommy_T-Bone_Caradonna&amp;action=edit"">Tommy T-Bone Caradonna</A> on bass and <A class=new title=""Jimmy De Grasso"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jimmy_De_Grasso&amp;action=edit"">Jimmy De Grasso</A> on drums. White Lion soon broke up, with their last show being held in Boston at the Channel in September 1991.</P>
<H2>After White Lion</H2>

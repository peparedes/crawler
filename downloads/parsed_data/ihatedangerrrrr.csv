"event","My father's a tit.
We were at Michael's yesterday picking out floral designs to go as the centerpiece of our coffee table. Since the scheme of our house is quite classy, and the focal point of the living room is the fireplace which is made of red bricks, i decided that yellow, white, and a hint of red flowers would accentuate the room. So we were at Michael's, and my dad picks out this hideous bronze bowl looking thing that looks like it came straight out of the swap meet, and decides that it will be the vase for the flowers. [ugh]
I didn't want to say anything because it's my father's house and it's his furniture he's going to decide to so blatantly tacky-up. [Personally my idea of a centerpiece for the table was a flat bowl/plate, preferrably silver because our coffee table is glass, as seen in the Bombay furniture magazine. The silver bowl would be filled with cobble stones and two yellow lillies casually lying along top of it.] 
But then, he choses to buy plastic flowers. He could have had the option of buying dried preserved flowers which i suggested since he doesn't want to buy real flowers [ schmuck ]. AND THEN he decides to go with this yellow orange tacky color with different kinds of flowers. Petunias is one. Roses another. And daisies. It was the most awful ensamble i had ever seen. because if you're going to make a floral design, especially with the scheme of my living room, you choose only TWO types of flowers. and if you choose 3 types, the third musnt be so goddamn big that you can't notice the other flowers. And plus, roses are the worst type of flowers you can put in your house unless you're motherfucking Pamela Anderson. Tulips or orchids were obviously the best way to go, and i'm not saying that just because they're my favourite flowers. 
But anyway. My dad goes to the register with these mixes of horrible looking plastic flowers on wire stems that look straight out of a church festival hoedown. 
I didn't say anything when he asked me what i thought of it, but i was laughing inside.

Next stop: Bombay company at the mall.
We were going for this Manchester table which was sold out. So we ended up buying this hideous wine rack that looks horrible with our furniture at home. 
AND THEN, my dad decides to put this variety of horrible wines onto the wine rack. Straight out of Rite Aid.

Jesus Christ.

This all sounds stupid. And i'm not even an interior designer so what the fuck am i saying. But i know my flowers and Petunias and Roses don't go together. Only a retard would do that. 

And there was my day.

!!"

"event","yesterday was a bore. 
except that I watched Requiem for a Dream which people have been constantly talking about.
I have to admit it was pretty good. But films of that sort are starting to get old [Donnie Darko, Fight Club, etcetera]

I've been talking to my former significant other lately.
Old fires rekindling.

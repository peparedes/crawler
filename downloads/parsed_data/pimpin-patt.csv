"event","I finally found time to write in this about my trip to the Bahamas.  The Bahamas was the coolest place I have ever been in my life.  It was the apitimy of FUN!  We hung out and did everything you could possiblly think of.  We went scuba diving, snorkeling, fishing...etc  We also had awsome food!  Those Bahamian people know how to cook their asses off!  Every meal we had at a restaurant was awsome, however quite pricey.  But that doesn't matter...Matt is rich$$$. Hahahaha anyway--i could sit here and type fr hours what I did but I figured that I would just leave it at the fact that I had TONS OF FUN!!!!  BAHAMAS 04'-JAMIE N MATT SPRING BREAK 2 REMEMBER!!!"

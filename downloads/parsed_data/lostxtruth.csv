"event","so i recently found my book, Susanna Sieglebaum Gives Up Guys, an awesome early 90's novel about a girl who gets confused and screwed over by guys a lot. So for thirty days, she gives up boys and gains some clarity on what shes looking for in a guy and, more importantly, what she isnt looking for in them.



in lieu of Susanna I, too, am giving up boys for thirty days. No new crushes, no sketchy creeps...nothing.
im kind of really excited haha


wish me luck?"

"event","i saw someone die today.
this morning on my way to drop off devons dog at the spca to get fixed.
i was really mad at her for making me wake up at 615, go all the way over to her house and then go another 30 minutes to the spca. i was on 35, passing borders and burger king when the car in front of me turned left. i yelled at them to stop. i yelled alot and loud. because a tractor trailer, who had the right of way, was going straight. they didnt stop. either could the truck. the truck pushed the car into the traffic light pole. i couldnt ust drive away so i called the police and pulled over since i know cpr and first aid. the guy had his seat belt on and his airbag went off, but it was useless. he was breathing, and was making sounds, then his breath went shallow and then stopped. i cired my eyes out. i didnt know what else to do. there was nothing i could do but wait. the poor trucker was sobbing and miserable. the poloce finally arrived and asked me questions, i couldnt believe it happened. they let me go and i went to the spca the woman was giving me a hard time, i couldnt deal with her crap. i dropped the dog off and left. when i was on my way home, the whole road was closed for a mile.
i cant believe i was mad at my sister this morning. or worried because the dog got mud on my jeans. it couldve been me in that car. i was turning next. who knows what could happen."

"event","so yesterday i went into hot topic because i havent been in there in a long time and i was buying an amazing shirt and i saw one of those rubber bracelet things and it was black and iwas like hmm what could that possibly be for...support death? haha in that store, you never know. so i picked it up and it said ""rock the arts"" and it was to raise money for art programs bc schools are cutting them left and right. and that bothers me. a lot. because the generation of younger kids are growing up on video games and computer games which creates the environment for you. you get to imagine nothing. art, meaning music and writing too, are how kids learn to imagine and create their own little world. and art and music classes were my favorite in elementary school and i think that they are just as important as the core subjects.

""She sat wondering how it was possible to want something so far out of her reach so badly.
So badly that she sometimes ached and would shed tears of longing. Knowing that he was having the same exact thoughts of another girl."" lucy davis, Untitled.

""And there it was. She spun her board towards shore, paddled like hell, and felt the water rush under her. She rose to her feet.
Be the wave. Be the wave.
Arms out, knees bent, totally concentrating on the moment, Anna Percy rode the wave. She laughed with joy as the wall of water powered her towards shore. Life, love, boys--it was all about balance."" -anna percy



i just dont get it. things are so complicated. its about balance, right? how do you go aout finding what that balance is when you dont even know what it is that you are balancing? how can it be that you feel something so strongly in a such futile situation? how can you feel so much for someone who doesnt feel that way towards you and probably never will? this whole system is unfair. and i cant help but wonder...where will i be this time next year? and who will i be there with?"

Tristen: My muscle is tight.

Tristen: No. (finishing stretching, closing door)
Mom: Of course not.
Tristen: What do I care what a bunch of strangers who I'll never see again think of me because i happened to use my time effeciently to open a door and stretch my leg? DO you think i care what they thnik of me for that one second?
Mom: True. Thats never stopped you before.
Tristen: Nope. It never will either.
Mom: ...I need some of whatever your taking.

"event","Dear Boy,
      I dont know if i know you, or if we have met. maybe we have and we know we have the potenial to be so much more but are too scared to change anything. maybe we never have met, but when we do, we'll know that it is something special. In the beginning i may try to push you away, but thats just because im scared that you just might be a nice guy who likes me and im not used to that, i tend to fall for jerks who treat me like garbage. i have a history of horrible events that cause me to hesitate beginning relationships. but i promise ill work through it, please PLEASE dont give up on me. All i want is to be able to call you and tell you about my day. I want you to do the same. I want to know that you are there for me, always. I want you to know that i dont get jealous very easily and will give you the utmost trust. I expect you will do the same for me. And in the beginning i may be too shy to kiss you, but please dont you feel shy, i wont push you away or slap you. I want to tell you everything and i want you to feel you can tell me anything. I want to hear what you have to say. I want you to listen to what i have to say. and i dont want us to spend every night together, please, hang out with your friends, i know i will be with mine. and please, never change for me, i wont like it. i want you to be the same boy i fell for..i know people change a little all the time, and thats okay, but nothing too crazy, okay? im not into petnames, so dont even think about it. and on those nights we are together, and theres nothing to do, maybe we could just go for a walk or play a game. maybe some times we could go grocery shopping with my mom. i want you to become a such a part of my life that my dogs dont even jump on you anymore. i want you to try to understand me, but you dont have to completely, nor do i expect you to, seeing as how i dont even understand myself. please know that sometimes, even though ill try to fight it, i do get in bad moods, chances are, it has nothing to do with you and everything to do with me. and when we do get into a fight, can we please talk about it? and then we'll get through it. but most importantly i want you to be my best friend and ultimate supporter. but, please dont patronize me. i enjoy honesty. i need honesty. i also need frequent trips to the beach to play frisbee. is that too much to ask? i wish i knew if this would last. i wish it would but every relationship is like a new deck of cards, and unfortunately, i tend to, well, suck at playing cards. maybe you could teach me how to play?
                                                                Sincerely,

i am not a spoiled brat. i have worked for just about everything i have. i own two cars. that i paid for. i pay for the gas. no i dont pay my insurance because i have good grades. the second i dont, i pay my insurance. i work three jobs, at the very least. not including being a student. i volunteer much of my free time to coaching st james cross country and track. i am not perfect. i make mistakes once and a while. sometimes i step out of the little box i made the mistake of creating for myself. forgive me. or dont. whatever i dont care. my life has been far from perfect. while most of my friends are planning parties and sleep overs, im scheduling doctors appointments. i live my life based on how im feeling, which usually isnt good. i am very sick i just dont like telling people what is acutally wrong with me. but i dont care anymore. i dont care. think what you want, you will anyway. sometimes i need to be home early. sometimes i cant go out at night. i am sick with things i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy. sure on the outside my family appears all american, but we arent. its all an act. well most of it anyway. im sick of people making things up about me and spreading rumors. what did i ever do to you? huh? please tell me so i can fix it. im sick of people taking advantage of the fact that i am a nice, honest, giving person. im sick of people taking advantage of me in general because they know i dont know how to stand up for myself. im sick of people being two faced and stabbing each other in the back. i hate the fact that there are only a certain number of people outside my family that i know i can trust. and those of you included should know who you are. im just asking for people to be nice again. to treat me and everyone else with respect. you dont know what im dealing with or going through so watch what you say, please. because sometimes, i get down too. please deal with the fact that although i try to be happy a lot, im not happy all the time. please dont expect me to be."

i want to fight this battle. im prepared..i have the equipment necessary, including a back-up heart. so this battle may be long, tedious and bloody but in the end, it'll be worth it.

this summer, we had a great time. our friends were incredible and we spent so many nights with them all. dan, matt, mike h, sara, justin, jeff, shannon, sean, nick, pete, mike m, the col(l)in's, chris, taylor and everyone else. even if we didnt have plans at 7 pm..we could just call one of those people and we'd have plans by 705. the monday night parties were unforgettable. so are all of the ship ahoy people. and cait flan <3

but whats even more incredible than that is this winter (yes..we know its not winter yet..but its not summer so it doesnt matter).  we became friends with another group of amazing people. lorraine (duh! <3), peter, josh, mike a, nick, tina, bob and mario and anyone else. and when i asked meg how we we always end up with a great group of friends around us...she said ""because we deserve it..we really do. we're good people, theyre good people. and good people find each other"""

It's easy to forget, sometimes we just forget

Maybe we'll forget, I hope we don't forget

this goes for alot of things. it goes for my friends the most though. ive known most of the people im friends with now for years and years. i have grown apart from some of my friends and thats no ones fault but it just shows that the people who were friends are in the past. the people who we are now are different and just can't relate to each other. im sorry about that. i wish it didnt happen. i really do. but the fact is, life changes and we cant help it. we just have to move with it and remember the good times because no one can ever take those away from us. and please...know that even though we might not be best friends anymore, i will always ALWAYS be here for you. because best friends--past or current, can't turn their backs on one another. and the friends that have lasted are the ones who have let me grow and change and do my own thing without expecting the same old tristen they knew when they were 5,9,14,16 even 17 to show up on their doorstep. they appreciate the fact that are that secure enough of our friendship to accept that. so thanks. to everyone. i love you all

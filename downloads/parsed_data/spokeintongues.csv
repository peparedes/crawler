"event","so that we may sing
so our bones be blessed
may we stand again
as time moves on
as crimson skies disperse
we raise our hands
and the flames...
we never said goodbye
but this didn't happen
so that we may sing
we bled eachother dry
so we may see
over waves of optimism
we smiled together
did this ever happen?
so that we may sing
so that we may live
we convinced ourselves
none of this ever happened"

"event","to the town i grew up in, i'm much too late.  i've been flirting with other sirens, you've been killing yourself.  but then people piled up by the by the water and with certain ambiguity, i've been hiding in the back.  but with 15 servants you were damned.  and i was glad to see them casting you to certain death.  the river knew better knew better and churned like a gift, the wrapping(?) killed the moment, but i pulled through the wake.  and in certain i knew you where gone, but with every waking hour, the ghosts churn by the wake.  all left ghosts will fear you, all have been lost.  but you, goddamn, you're a fear for them, in the chill.  cast like a leper into that, that whichs binds, but all too familiar was the sound, sound of lies.  you still live on!  but what was that that killed you?  has it been my fault?  no, ghost and twisted love ended you, a love none too real.  and poems cannot save you.  my god it's been so long!  the curse is still here, oh god why?  why why why?  kirsten, we freed you, chains no regard!  but since then know not what to say; what's the plan?  my dear, i've grow tired.  oh disregard!  whatever, the pleas!  kill the noise!  kill the noise!

"event","""sunset on the mountaintops as another day closes and the streetlamps flutter in uneven pulsating rhythms, summons the workers to the beds and the children, who heads never rest, are laid down with ease.

sunset on the mountaintops, scarlet ignores the lack of sunlight and keeps pushing pens to parchment until her knuckles bleed.  grinning she looks up and tells a lie: 'i know god will help me until i die, god will guide me until i can't help this town anymore'.

and mountains' shadows aren't a sign of impending doom, their a veil to hide us from it for just a few more hours.

sunset on the mountiontop and in the dusk while scarlet sleeps i read what she wrote: 'god is a vessel for excuses and we can't be helped anymore'."""

"event","""it's so cold i wonder if my bones will freeze.  across this creek i thought i saw my prey.  but the snow, when it's like this it's decieving.  i polished my gun good for this one.  oiled to perfection.  she'll never know what hit her.  she spots me and gallops harder thought the crunchy snow.  she can't go too far.  did she not see the size of this thing?  the allure of it all, the waiting...i aim carefully  for an imaginary hole.  gaping oozing holes, that's my destination.  perfectly natural.  pulling the trigger, preparing for my release.  she'll never know what hit her.  this hunter has a lonely heart, this old fool needs a little jumpstart, whether she likes it or not.  that doe is dead.  i feel like a better man for it."""

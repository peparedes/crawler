"event","So yeah. It's november. Halloween already passed and it was actually quite a bit of fun. Went to Duxbury with Ida to go trick or treating with her brother, his wife, and her three kids. It twas fun, they actually keep the trick or treating thing there, unlike falmouth or even cape cod, which has less and less kids every year going out. 

Boo ya. I have a chance to make Christmas something Ida likes this year. That makes me happy. I like it, and not for any religious reasons. It's just warm feeling, even if the air is actually cold. Has always been that way for me. Three days after that will be one year :). It seems like it has been longer and yet shorter than that at the same time... I don't know why. Meow!



I guess I have been doing a bad job recently of showing you how much I care for you, getting in fights and all that... it doesn't show you how much I love you, I bet it pushes you away more or less. I kind of suck like that. K thats it for this post cause you sat down nexr to me :)


I love you."

I'll just have to be good and not crash or get any speeding tickets once I've moved into the apartment. Hyannis will be interesting. My mom gave me a good idea. Don't quit my job or give two weeks notice until I've made sure that I have gotten a job.

I'm so annoyed with dumbass idiots who only care about their image in the public eye, they butt into something that really isn't even their fucking business to care about. Oh-Em-Gee. My friends came in chained to each other? OMG, and that has something to do with me? Because I totally control them, holy shit, my image! I must tell them to stop and keep things in private that are meant to be that way! Holy shit. Why can't you just say hey ""yeah those are my friends... I don't actually control them, they do what they want, and it really has nothing to do with me""? I think that would be my reaction if a co-worker or my boss said something to me. If the boss had such a problem with a JOKE, he could have said something to the people himself, and you should have told him that. 

Anyways done with that rant. What else is on my mind. Oh. Well lets just say maybe I kind of thought someone actually liked me, but joked about it before I really thought that? Now I feel bad. Bad mean jerk face Kelley. 

Yay for Ipods. Uh yeah cause my computer right now is not hooked up because my room just got painted, however I am using my parents computer, which has no audio/speaker system set up. Wonderful, and I am so not patient to set up the speakers again. So yay. Ipod.

"event","I went looking to see if I could find any pictures from yesterday's Youth Pride 2007 and found this: 
Is Governor Deval Patrick attending Youth Pride to receive his announced award or not? His staff has said both things. We read in Bay Windows this morning that he is not planning to attend. (The person presenting the Youth Pride awards shows his stuff in the photo above.)

Whether Gov. Patrick will be present at the event or not, he should renounce the award! Look at the photos of the people involved in the Youth Pride day, and the BAGLY queer/trans prom that evening at Boston City Hall. This is a disgrace to all of Massachusetts. How can our Governor encourage young people to become involved in such dangerous and perverted activities and groups? He is truly contributing to the endangerment of the youth of Massachusetts by his support of Youth Pride! ----


That is the most retarded thing ever. Of course at the top of the page it says : ""The citizens of Massachusetts have had enough! End judicial tyranny, homosexual ""marriage"", and homosexual activist recruitment of our children in the public schools!""




Can someone please tell me why recruiting people (if thats even what they really do, instead of just informing) to a cause is so bad? How the fuck is it endangering anyone? Being homosexual isn't dangerous. When is it? When someone is but afraid to come out because they're family and community is so against it, so they find ways of ""escaping"" it, which is where the danger comes in. If kids didn't have these fears, then it wouldn't really be any kind of danger, now would it. Okay so you say Aids is another problem, well its just as much of a problem for heterosexual relationships as it is for homosexual. Anyone can get aids through sex. 

The Govenor isn't contributing to perverted activities, it's a time and place for those who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and the straights who aren't judgemental but accepting, to come out and act as a community a meet others just the same and have fun. 

As another factor for the recruiting statement, what, it's not like joining in a GLBT or other pride organization at a school is going to turn your child into a homosexual, they are what they are, and if they already are gay, then it's not because they joined the group. Straights join too just to show their peers support in living life as they are, not as their parents or society wants them.

I have a short fuse that was at peace for a while but seems to be coming back in full force, and I'm not happy about it. I will get mad at people for stupid little reasons, I will become really moody, gah. I am really moody right now, I can feel it, but it's probably because I am tired. I wish I didn't seem to have this sick twisted knack of pushing the people I care about away from me, or even worse, picking on those close to me to make myself feel better. I do it with out realizing it, I should learn to pay more attention to what I am doing or saying when I speak and such.

Okay, so parents are stupid. "" are you going to grow your hair back?"" ""yeah probably""  ""good because you need to"" and they give me shit for having a few hickey's on my neck. It's my fucking body and if I want to send that ""really wrong message"" to people I can. It's my buisness and I don't give a shit if it's not traditional. Having a girlfriend isn't ""traditional"" anyways, so why would I care? Case and point I don't care. ""I don't understand   your desire to fuck another woman"". Pffftt. Of course you don't understand. They don't know what it was like to grow up and feel attracted to the same sex when being told that it's not natural and that we were made to mate with males to reproduce ourselves. I have alot more to say on this subject but right now is not the time and place.

Parents are stupid even when it doesn't come to ones normal life outside of their sexuality. They have this need to keep control over their children for as long as possible and even sometimes make their lives miserable. They are so annoying.

Of course my mother couldn't have forced me to be an honor student but perhaps pushed me harder. I'm thankful, I got to do almost anything I wanted younger, but didn't get everything I wanted.

Morals that come from stories, the ironies that occur, the lessons you could say, there are some pretty good ones out there. I wish I could write, I've tried before. I like contrast. It makes me smile. How one thing can be right, and the exact opposite can be too just in the same. That is an expample. Things aren't always right. My Second Favorite Class is a tie between Western Religions and my hirstory class. Let's just not talk about Sociology. 



""The world moves for love, it kneels before it in awe.""

I think that is one of my favorite quotes, and I only hold it true for love that is real, exists, not the fake kind people portray too often. Love is hard to find, too many ""give"" their hearts out too easily. It should be earned, not given.

"event","Considering all day at work there is really nothing to do, Candice (co-worker) and I tend to talk alot about random shit. We talked about how men tend to need to have control, many, not all, but many, only ever tend to look at women as a piece of ass. She used to be into feminist movements, so her opinions are a little one sided. To think of it though, she makes a few good points. Most men, hetero sexuals of course, could not stand if their girlfriend, wife, lover, whatever had a higher paying job, had a position of power, or even worse, supported him. If men don't think lesbian's are ""hott"" they hate them because they can't control them. No, I know, there are plenty of exceptions, this is just how I'm seeing it. There aren't as many men who are willing to be on an equal level with women, they have to have some form of power, if not direct control, something else that makes it so they can make the decisions. The first time you talk to a man who is checking you out, is he thinking, what a great personality? Usually not, he is thinking about having sex with you. When you get into a relationship like that, chances are he is checking out other women, but sticks around with you because you preform basic duties he wants. This is a some what one sided opinion, but I kind of see it as true in many ways, but it doesn't apply to all, and I have nothing to worry about anyways, I set with a relationship, and I love her.

I thought I was going to kill her, infact I don't know what stopped me from not, maybe the thought of jail. Who the fuck is she to tell us where and when we can kiss who we want!? That's fucking stupid. First off, if you have a problem with anything that isn't a heterosexual relationship you shouldn't be working in a place like that, fucking public. Why the fuck does she care even if she has problem with it. She can look away, it's not that hard. I guess that's the first time I have personally been exposed to that fucking shit and I'm surprised I didn't say anything to her. She had no right to say that and I'm pissed.

I already said I want it to last too, and I really do. I am really happy. Sitting around doing nothing just being with her makes me happy. Watching really weird videos that make me want to pee myself laughing, going to the knob, not going out and having to always spend money to make something fun happen, it makes me really happy. I don't enjoy when she leaves, or I have to leave her. I love her. It makes me wonder alot about myself. Am I a lesbian? I could never get it to work with a guy, I loved Paul, and it was never a lie when I told him I did, but what I now realize is it wasn't like this. I do love paul, but only as a friend. Back to that question though, paul was the one person that I thought if it's going to work it will with him, and it didn't. That <b>was</b> what I thought. Even though I have this question on my mind, I don't see the point in classifying myself, it only add's to seperating myself from other's, so what is the point. 

<font size=""2""><b>Things you say make me really happy, even if they are just a sentence or even a few words.</b></font>



Well tomorrow I work. Yay for that shit. I will have my smile with me though. I have to see Tom so that I may give him money to grab my text book for me. I love tom for the things he does for me often. I can never show it enough, I really do appreciate him. He is always there for me when I need him, and when things are going good he still there, which makes those good times even better. Steve has always been there too. Steve is like my kid brother, though he is only a few months younger (mind wise is worse hahaha).

"event","Let's be clear what we're talking about: Video.  No one is going to try to profit by charging different rates for different streams of text.  Text was out the barn door before we ever started having this conversation.  Then images escaped, and still everyone was stunned still.  When audio started to escape, the Napster era, finally the defenders of the status quo leaped into action-- and failed.  They had no idea what they were fighting, and they never landed a single solid blow. 

So now they're taking a crack at video.  They're doing a much better job.  The ISPs intentionally slow-walked the bandwidth so we'd spend as long as possible in the region where video is sluggish; now we're forced to walk slowly through this pass where they can spring their ambush.  But that's all we're fighting over: Just video, and just the next few years.  In a few years the technology forces the situation by making video so tiny it can slip through any net.  There's a lot of money that could be made in those few years, but it's not as much money as they're imagining. 

They're imagining taking control of us forever.  That is not going to happen.  None of us have the power to back information technology into Pandora's box, not even for a good reason, not even if we need to to save humanity, never mind so someone can make a few bucks selling videos.  Soon the cost of storing or transferring a video will approach zero, and this fight will be history.  If we invent something that takes more bandwidth than a video, there will be a window of a few years where it might be possible to control that, whatever it is.  But it will never last forever.  The theoretical limits on bandwidth are very far away, more than enough to transfer entire humans never mind any human media. 

This is a ridiculous game with little actual relevance to the future of humanity."

"event","Craig, 

I've seen numerous interviews with you over the years, and I've always been impressed with your wit, modesty and individuality.  I am of the mind that something of the general shape of Craigslist was inevitable, but OTOH it was a wonderful surprise to see it done with such grace and class.  I wish therefore it were a different circumstance that brought myself to your attention than <a href=""http://twitter.com/mungojelly/statuses/1336496442"">this tweet of mine</a>: 

<blockquote>mungojelly: @jayrosen_nyu Craigslist is completely untrustworthy. You'd think there'd be a new niche in providing some sort of local trust relationship.</blockquote>

To which you responded with <a href=""http://twitter.com/craignewmark/statuses/1336508000"">this tweet of yours</a>: 

<blockquote>craignewmark: @mungojelly Can you clarify your remark re #craigslist ? Thanks! craig at craigslist.org</blockquote>

I was going to say that you were completely justified in taking offense, but upon rereading your tweet I see that it's completely diplomatic!  That's what I'm talking about-- classy.  Anyway, since you asked, certainly I'll do my best to explain the point that I so failed to cram into those 140. 

<lj-cut text=""6 paragraphs of tl;dr"">

Craigslist as a website can certainly be trusted to do what it does.  It's so simple and stable, in fact, that it has become both an institution and an archetype.  Indeed the intended context of my tweet is the increasingly echoed and accepted (if unsettling to many) notion that newspaper classified advertising in its entirety has gone up against Craigslist and lost. 

What cannot be trusted at all are the unwashed, unfiltered masses who use Craigslist.  Almost all of them are trustworthy as individuals, of course, but any particular unknown one of them can't be trusted to be anything in particular, can't be trusted to be what they claim to be.  We all compensate heavily for the fact that the people who we encounter in a public space like Craigslist are strangers, unknown actors:  We meet in public places.  We ask for money upfront.  We inspect the merchandise. 

In this arena traditional newspaper classified advertising, unfortunately for the industry it sustains, has hardly any advantage whatsoever over Craigslist.  Its barrier to entry is a fee, which quite obviously rules out almost all positive contributions-- while also providing no protection at all against any assailant who finds an attack sufficiently valuable.  Phone or credit card verification can be done as easily by a centralized online competitor as a local newspaper, and I don't see any reason to consider it all that valuable anyway: It's not as if we trust someone very much given only the information that they have a phone or a credit card. 

Where I think my local newspapers still have a thin advantage, if they could wake up to take it, is that they occupy physical space just a few blocks from where I'm sitting.  If they could look up from the supposedly important facts on their desks out at the supposedly unimportant, unnewsworthy people strolling by outside their office, I think they could find that they have access to a flavor of information which is uselessly ordinary in the real world, but just what the internet is hungry for.  The solid knowledge that someone lives somewhere, that they work somewhere, that they have certain ongoing relationships with their community, just the fact that they exist at all-- it doesn't seem like much, but it's completely missing on the internet.  You don't know me from Adam.  So if the Burlington Free Press could verify to you even simply that I often walk by their bricks and gilded letters just down the way, which I do, you'd know with much more certainty and authority that I am who and where I say that I am. 

Systems of trust and identity are certain to become increasingly important, and we should all play some role in shaping that future.  I thought of it as a possible niche for the local newspapers partly because they are supposedly in the business of seeking out and verifying facts, but mostly because you've so innocently crushed their old business model.  Whoever ends up creating them, though, I am sure that we will over time come to rely on systems of trust that do allow us to take immediate actions to invest substantial resources on the basis of internet communications. 

I believe in time this will even allow a new economy built upon voluntary collective activity, which will empower not just those who can sniff out marginal opportunities, but also those who can deserve and build wide trust.  You should do well!

"event","The actual date when the technology was available for the bulk of U.S. attention to switch from old media to open blogging was at least twenty years ago.  We've been slogging through inertia for decades. 

Similarly, I believe that the date at which it was first possible for the U.S. to switch from a currency based economy to a more rational system of organizing collective activity has already passed.  Now we just have to slog through a few decades of people saying ""but that doesn't <i>count</i> somehow"" before we can actually implement the change. 

Money is absurd on its face, and deeply irrationalizing when employed.  Real value is multifaceted, not quantifiable.  On some level you know this basic fact, and yet as a hypnotized participant you may have the unsupportable feeling that to this dramatic wrongness there must be some compensating right.  There is, but only historically; looking at value through this simplifying lens allowed it to be processed by an information system so antiquidated that its bits must literally be purchased and manipulated individually. 

Like the blogging revolution, what I am talking about is not so much a transfer as a broadening of power.  No one system alone will replace the roles money now plays in our life.  Indeed, because of the conservative inertia, I expect it to look more like a gradual attrition than a sudden transformation.  Parts of the transformation-- blogging, free open source, media piracy, flashmobs-- are well underway, and being understood only in isolation (certainly not as a threat to commodified value itself). 

Over the next few decades, though, we will be forced to become aware of how all these new allowances are spreading and stitching together.  The line that separates ""real"" things in the ""real"" money economy from the encroaching ""unreal"" things will fall into as helpless a retreat as the mainstream media are now in.  Already we must rationalize to ourselves that so many things which didn't used to seem so ""unreal"", like entertainment, news, and communication, have solidly crossed the line. 

And underneath this transformation, acknowledged or not, will continue the voluntary but complete abdication of the day-to-day operation of society to artificial intelligences.  But that's a whole other story."

"event","Google is always just a step behind the avant-garde, which is impressive for a large company.  They've just added this thing searchwiki, which allows you to comment on results and vote them up or down.  That seems to me like an emerging consensus: Comments should be allowed on <i>everything</i>, at worst tucked far away (as these new Google comments (unfortunately) so far are).  Why trust something that doesn't allow comments?  What has it got to hide? 
 
And furthermore this most base style of commentary is emerging: Thumbs up or thumbs down.  Some sort of colosseum we're all entering!  It's odd; I feel in the end it must be a phase.  But for the moment it's unquestionably better than what we had before: Comments used to be almost universally sorted by date, which leads either to a scrolling empty newness or to the even bizarrer world of ""first post!""  Community editing is surely imperfect, but compared to that unfiltered firehose it seems a dawning light of rationality. 
 
So those two parts together form a somewhat working system: Everything allows comments, and colosseum filtering makes those comments relevant and rational.  Until something better comes along, I expect that model to gradually permeate everything."

a few months ago i felt like there was something big i was missing.  or maybe something small.  no i felt like i was looking at something simple from a weird angle, and missing the obvious.  i was trying to figure out what was going to happen, or what should happen, with Money and the Economy and Capitalism and all this stuff we've been doing, as we fall further down the rabbithole. 
 
i got trapped for a few weeks, or so, following the fool's gold of the Next Money.. something overcomplicated, something extra, something extrafancy new.  i was thinking something like: what could we adopt next after money?  but that's a senseless way to think about it.  we never adopted money as a system.  particular systems of money get supported for various reasons throughout history, but we never had any choice about whether money was going to exist.  money is there in value & trade & scarcity, it's the natural abstraction. 
 
but i was feeling like we're moving past money, we're doing something new.  i was trying to figure out, what are we going to do next to structure ourselves, instead of money?  trying to zoom out a little, trying to see money not just as a tool for doing this one thing, but seeing it in its role in society.  playing the money system has a particular emotional & identity-establishing quality to it.  it employs so much of the effort and activity of humanity because of its way of drawing in so much attention, making itself so necessary.  people relate to it as not just a technology but an establishing force in their lives. 
 
so i began to look beyond trade, for instance, or beyond production & distribution.  these are notions i began to feel that belong to money itself.  i felt that we are going beyond not just money but the very ground assumptions on which money rests.  scarcity, for instance, is essential to money as we understand it.  people engage with money not just as a tool for efficiently extracting value from their around, which is basically what it is, but as an absolutely essential part of their life and identity-- they do that because there's enough ambient scarcity that they decide they need to extract value from something in their around and turn it into food... 
 
after a few months maybe it's been of thinking very deeply, if not very productively, about this subject.. driven by an unsettledness in my own thinking, feeling that there was something just around the corner, some way to make it click.. i have come to a peace with it.  i feel that i've realized something essential, even though i have nothing but air to explain to you.  i'm looking at money from a slightly different angle now, and with that plus the first angle i can make out the shape of it: it's right there, it's that small. 
 
here's what i can consciously explain so far of what i have realized.  this is what i think will replace money as the economic organizing force of our society: Voluntary Collective Action.  it's that simple, cuttingly simple: people just deciding to do things together.  indeed i believe it will win as an organizing principle of society precisely because it is even simpler than money. 
 
money's only virtue is its simplicity.  it hides all of the complexities of value behind a singular facade.  the driving character of the old life is that you have needs, survival needs, which can only be satisfied by things that are valuable in the sense of distant and expensive.  to satisfy those needs within severe time and processing constraints (aka stupidity), you seek out a mother's teat, a SYSTEM into which you can put what you have-- such as a human effort-- and receive what you need-- such as a human life.  money is relatively simple to use.  money is <i>relatively</i> simple to use. 
 
but money is actually quite complex.  see, i started this letter a few days ago, theoretical listener, and then i stopped back in that paragraph last round about (Exactly) just atfer the words ""(aka stupidity),"".  There it rested.  And I am still in the same state of halfformedvision which I had explained to you.  But things do seem clearer today, as I expect and hope and urge of my little mind that they ought to every day, that I ought to get just a little bit further. 
 
Money.  Is a system.  A natural system.  A natural system which is also created and controlled by humans-- human natures-- a human natural system.  It's simple, but it's not so simple.  What do you DO, if you relate to money?  You must value things.  It only seems like a little matter, if you're already so bothered by it.  You must value just about everything, anything which you want to involve in the system.  It's a digitizing system, and it only accepts things which are digitized into the proper format.  It's a simple enough format: They have to have a VALUE slapped onto them.  A simple system, a natural system.  This costs TWO DOLLARS and TWENTY SEVEN CENTS!  Exact!  Precise!  Simple. 
 
What's simpler, of course, is to NOT tack a value on something.  To not digitize it, to not valuate it, to not enter it into the system.  Most things, of course, aren't.  Most things do not participate.  The airplane roaring over my head now was sold for a price, as was each seat.  It's involved.  The air it travels through, not as much.  The revolutionary war era gravestones next door are just sitting there.  Venus revolves untouched.  Down here on Earth there is a process unfolding, a game where things are given labels, $2.27.  Some of the things.  Some of the time.  Those things that are important to that game-- some of them are important, relevantly valuable, and make that game relevant to some bipeds on that planet. 
 
Another stream of my thought has been to consider these vast untouched realms.  It's like the fundamental unspoken bizarre underbelly of U.S. electoral politics that hardly anyone rarely dares to touch: That only half of the eligible voters vote.  Thus their fundamental uneasiness, knowing that a total transformation is always just under their feet.  Money I suggest ought to feel the same uneasiness: It does not represent all of value, only a particular kind of digitized value.  Most of the actual conclusion is turnout: What people actually do. 
 
So I had been sitting equally uneasily with imagining this great river of unlabelled value.  Before I even considered it in those terms, and my skepticism of the money system was less well formed, I had an unnameable ghost shape crying in my mind: This Does Not Add Up.  Everyone knows that most of the value created in our society is created outside of the money system.  Parents caring for children.  Lovers caring for each other.  Art.  Helping strangers.  We understand that the illusion of completeness cast by money hides how much of our lives are outside of it. 
 
ok i'm back again.  so um what did i realize.  well... that it does go together.  the only missing ingredient to turn the stream of everything into a viable alternative to the particular stream of monetized things, is a certain organization.  we were stuck relating to the system because it was one of our only digital information networks.  it's expensive to send packets in a physical network back before it could be automated, so the only people sending reliable signals were people relating to value, because they were getting paid for doing it.  but that shows the astonishing inefficiency of it. 
 
so many levels of inefficiency.  the worrying.  the handling.  the worrying.  the fighting.  obviously we're going to drop it.  that's another thing that sent me down thinking aobut this.  but how can we?  what's it going to look like if we do?  all of this drama that's happening right now with ""the financial market"", and here we are all just as calm and collected and together as ever, here on THIS network.  here we are able to create value so much more easily.  BAM!  i am writing to you!  this has minimal value, granted!  but it has some value!  and it has been created!  no market needed! 
 
the market is spinning itself into the ground.  god knows i haven't been helping it much lately.  i know some people who have been helping a little.  but i don't know anyone who's helping it enthusiastically.  the new wave, the new thinking, the new interactions, the new structures, those are being supported very enthusiastically.  but they are also in their infancy.  so we have yet to see :>;.;.....h tnh. thuuuuu if we can survive the crossing. 
 
it's justt one aspect.  everything's just one aspect.  it's getting difficult to see.  like a fog of nanites obscuring reality.  well, was it ever easy to see reality?  it was just easier to fake it for a lifetime.  no more fake anything now i suppose.  we're burning the house to stay warm."

"event","There is much talk about the absurdity of anarchist candidates.  I have concocted a platform which I believe should appeal to anarchists and other advocates of direct democracy.  It does not exactly contradict the absurdity, so much as exploit it.  This is the only platform under which I myself would ever consider running for a public office. 
 
The platform is quite simple, and has nothing whatsoever to do with any issues at all.  The candidate would pledge (save <i>perhaps</i> true emergencies) to make absolutely no decisions themselves.  The decisions would instead be delegated to a mechanism of direct democracy.  The candidate would be a figurehead, and their vote would always be cast as the new mechanism demands. 
 
The electoral system offers a promise, a promise to allow the people a chance to grab at the authority which only kings once held, a promise which we-- I speak here for anarchists, and for other believers in the possibility of true and direct democratic power-- have often derided as false, as worthlessly partial.  What though if we were to take them at their word?  What if we were to indeed take the power offered, and give it not (as they would have us do) to a single corruptible small human mind, but instead simply to grab the power and HOLD it? 
 
Hold it indeed, hold it quite easily, I would submit, as who could dare run against such a system, if even partially functioning, on the astonishing platform that they would take the power away from the people at large and invest it entirely and unaccountably in themselves alone?  Anarchist candidates are absurd indeed, but the absurdity has always belonged to the other party.  Let us take them up on their fool's gambit."

My whole life it seems I've been aware of the stark situation, that the ""airwaves""-- which are hardly property in any ordinary sense, you must understand, but a social agreement about what color one's signals are allowed to be-- while supposedly owned and directed by the people have in fact been owned and directed by large corporations, which consciously use them to assist in maintaining a particular social order. 
 
Only lately has there been the growing consensus and social momentum towards undoing this astonishingly destructive state of affairs.  It's a bit late, since we're mere years from undoing the color prohibitions by force of technology (prohibitions of particular wavelengths?! clearly it's just a matter of time), but since these are critical years the timing may yet make some difference.  I certainly strongly support all efforts to open as much bandwidth as possible for relatively unrestrained public use."

"event","I was not around for the sixties, but I have heard two tremendously different stories from my society about the ""sexual revolution"".  The Official History I have been given calls it that, the ""Sexual Revolution"".  It focuses obsessively and entirely on sex.  That story is a story of the transformation of sex from (before) a method of social control by absolute prohibition and the oppressive structure of traditional marriage, to (now) a method of social control by spectacle, a forbidden and yet highly available fruit to busy the mind and distract the public. 
 
That transformation in the structure of control was necessitated by a popular movement of rebellion, but it was not of course that movement's objective.  No one looked at how marriage was an institution of control in that society of those times, and thought that it would be better instead to have sex glamorized, turned into a public spectacle, and used to continue selling the last gasps of Capitalism to an increasingly bored populace.  It's my intuition that the true objective was deeper, more real, had less to do with ""sex"" as now defined, and remains utterly unaccomplished. 
 
The Spectacle, forced by an unusually conscious human movement of transformation to look directly at Touch, and at Sex, and at Naked Human Bodies, did an admirable job of adapting.  Its main compensation seems to have been to recast the concept of ""sex"" in as narrow a way as possible, focusing it specifically on those sexual activities which are most dangerous & controllable.  That alone might have left other sexual freedoms free to sneak around the edges, except that the new ""sex"" was allowed to expand its cultural role very powerfully, put not just in public but in the center of public awareness and given slack to ooze its way deep into the public mind, into the many dangerous unthinkable activities which our society unconsciously believes must somehow be restrained.

"event","Individual <i>Homo sapiens</i> monkeys now struggling against senseless chemical and botantical prohibitions encounter difficult obstacles, which are real and substantial and primarily emotional.  To act as an individual is to act toward achieving a goal.  This is the desire of those who would continue prohibition: That we as individuals should each hold in mind a goal like ""The End Of Prohibition"", briefly struggle in our own ways toward that goal, and experience failure.  Failure is all we can possibly experience if we attempt to attain that grand goal by ourselves, in one or a series of rebellious acts; our first human action alone naturally fails to end the human war. 
 
<lj-cut text=""Only together can we win."">
 
Only together can we win.  And so our individual struggle must be to link our effort with a larger effort.  Our song is already clear, our instruments are tuned, and we are only waiting for the notes to be played, but people must by necessity (to conserve their energy) watch & wait, and dedicate themselves to an attempt only once they believe it can succeed.  There must be a movement which carries in its heart an absolute certainty that the deed can be done-- only then will those who have laid down their passion be willing to pick it back up.  There must be a movement which includes & activates & makes real.  It must be the right movement, of the right people, at the right time. 
 
I am calling for that movement.  I am not declaring it; I cannot, as I do not know its name.  I am calling for it.  I am calling it out.  I am calling all those who know that they are who would and must participate in that movement, when its time did come: Believe with me, if you will, that it indeed has.  Believe with me and make it true. 
 
Here is my strategy: We will begin to support each other.  Outside of any rigid organization, outside of any inhuman structure.  We will decide our own practices, and freely change them, and be bound by nothing but trust and solidarity.  We will speak with as many voices and as few as our true feelings and positions.  We will be absolutely real, uncompromised, unchoreographed, natural.  We will grow.  We will grow by unquestioning acceptance: We will only enhance communication, respecting and amplifying the views of all, friends and enemies alike.  We will pursue whatever strategies seem most effective & pure, consciously collectively refining them. 
 
Power in society is harnessed through communication.  Networks of people who decide to act in concert have collective experiences, which when shared become conscious collective experiences.  Those experiences are experiences of being far more powerful than an individual human: They are experiences of having the power to communicate to thousands or millions of people simultaneously.  Leaders exploit this power of the people, placing it upon their heads as a crown and pretending the power and wisdom of the group originate from them.  Without leaders, groups are just as capable of experiencing their collective power as freely originated and freely employed. 
 
Here is how I suggest we take our power: Let us form <i>small</i> groups.  Groups so small that they are in immediate personal communication.  Hexagons, you could call them, suggesting the strength in solidarity of six-sided shapes.  You need not join with me, if I am not who you trust: Join with your own friends, or whoever you know or find.  Let us then join those groups together into larger groups and movements and networks.  Hexagons, aware of their own identities, consciously and collectively joining into larger hexagons, aware of their larger identities, each level consciously voluntarily composed of conscious and free members. 
 
The particular strategies I propose are my particular ideas.  Your ideas are more important to me.  But our ideas are useless to each other if they are the untested fantastical ideas of isolated individuals.  Correct or not, they are ungrounded, & find no traction.  We must continually test our ideas in the fire of action, and make each idea an idea for how to plant our very next footstep.  We must join together into one body, with the complexity of organization which is necessary for true freedom, the consciousness which is required to choose a path, and eventually the strength which ensures victory."

"event","The main work to be accomplished in defeating the prohibition on the sacred plant <i>Cannabis sativa</i> is the work of public education.  This work could easily be accomplished by the millions of friends this plant already has, so the entire task is the <i>activation</i> of this existing latent transformative energy. 
 
Since paranoia, justified or not, is the fundamental barrier which prevents large-scale participation in a legalization movement, I have been focusing my attentions on ways to design a movement which is decentralized, anonymous, uncontrollable and unfiltratable, and yet which provides the coherence, identity, direction and community which are necessary.  It feels to me like trying to light a fire in a very large pile of very wet wood: It's difficult to get a spark going, but once there is a strong enough fire, it could start to clear its own way in great breaths of steam. 
 
Here is my nascent praxis: A movement composed of independent cells, tiny affinity groups which provide encouragement and emotional support to each other.  There would be no central organization or hierarchy, though cells would communicate with each other on larger scales to organize large-scale action through rough consensus.  Those cells which chose to could grow the movement by cellular division, accepting new members one by one until reaching a sufficient size to divide into two independent cells.  Each cell would have complete control of its own praxis and destiny-- a thousand flowers, a thousand experiments, and the most activating and enriching will continue, expand, and deepen. 
 
At first these cells could serve merely to encourage the kind of independent secret propaganda actions which we all could be participating in on our own, but aren't merely because we aren't inspired to, or don't feel ourselves a part of a movement which gives our individual actions weight.  We can write ""LEGALIZE MARIJUANA"" in sidewalk chalk.  We can put up posters on telephone polls.  We'll go out into the night, and every morning new mysterious messages will appear-- a first whisper escaping to break the silence. 
 
In time this whisper will and must grow to a roar.  I envision masked protests: I imagine green faces and green hooded robes, like a flock of medusa monks.  But many aesthetics can emerge, many visions and many paths.  We will all travel together, each freely chosen action another stone thrown on our collective dam, to change the course of this story and the course of this society.  Our message is clear-- only our silence remains.

Every single possible & impossible thing!  God made no choices.  God-- that God who made the universe-- is not a choice-maker, except for making all decisions ever made (and making them every which way).  God is a universe maker.  A universe is that thing which is made of everything.  God simply made *everything*. 

Every object of every size, shape, composition and detail.  Many of them again exactly the same, coincidentally-- coincidences not being rare at all, beyond the stars-- through countless (no, wait, I counted: infinite) physical universes. 

<lj-cut text=""Most relevantly to your own situation, God created every experience."">Most relevantly to your own situation, God created every experience.  God created experiencing objects, and an infinite number of objects for every experience experiencable by an object, but God also created any and all experiences which are not experiencable by objects.  God created those experiences which make sense, if you line them up in a line in a fractal-like swirl of Time, and God equally and justly and magnanimously created all those experiences which do not make sense, which are fractured and senseless and silly.  God made every possible person, and every person's every moment, the entire panorama. 

There thus can be no question at all why you are having a particular experience, as you are having it.  It truly had to be that way.  Your experience you are presently having is possible, as evidenced by your experiencing it, and therefore it was inevitable-- no that's not half strong enough, it was *included* in the universe itself.  There is no use asking, either, why *you* must be the one to experience it, because who ""you"" are is simply who you define yourself as, as part of that experience. 

Think of all your invisible companions on this trip through Time-- not those who are right here in this physical place, interacting with you, but those who are so close they cannot touch you: The other versions of yourself who are only just so slightly different.  They are as real as anything is real, and closer to you in spirit than any of the people you know in physical space.  Your lives and their lives are wound together, a strong rope which is much larger than this tiny thread of a life. 

You do not need to live your life as if it were lived in only one body, one life, one place, one time.  You can live your life in Spirit, aware of all of the selves that you could have been, that you are, who you might yet be.  In this physical universe, in response to these words, one You feels one feeling and chooses one course.  In another nearby place, some slightly different words emerge, and a different You has ever so subtly different feelings, different choices, different paths.  Maybe every one of you could have the experience of seeing each other, across the physically impenetrable closeness that divides you. 

And we are all woven in the end from one thread, we are one God's mind, and every self traces every path, and beyond time it is already finished.  Amen.

I used to sort of have a vague impression that ASL was a very expressive language, and I conceived of that in terms of my idea of gesture.  I realize now that I wasn't capable on my own of conceiving of the astounding ways in which ASL is expressive. 
 
I'll try to describe what I mean, but keep in mind that these are just my impressions of ASL after only like a month of study, not an informed perspective. :)  There's some signs in ASL that are what I've seen called ""pantomimic,"" where you're acting something out, and of course you can characterize the action by the way you act it.  That's what I could imagine of ASL's expressiveness before I started to learn it.  What there is in addition to that, is numerous different <i>abstract</i> situations, rendered in handshapes interacting in the air, so that you can add that kind of acting-out expressiveness to ideas that aren't concrete. 
 
I tried and failed to explain any examples of what I mean. :)  It's hard to explain because I'm just starting to experience it myself.  But just believe me it is very magical and powerful and good!

"event","<lj user=""brningfield""> told me that I shouldn't have any of ""his"" Chyawanprash.  I am trying to wrap my mind around this.  Let me give you a little context: Chyawanprash is what in India they call a ""rasayana"", a dietary tonic which is healthful & balancing for most people.  <lj user=""brningfield""> and I discovered it at an Indian grocer near where we live, and we've since adopted it as a regular part of our diet. 
 
<lj user=""brningfield""> expects me to make Chyawanprash for him every morning and every evening.  He is very upset if I don't make it quickly enough for him after he gets up, or if I forget to make it before going to bed.  I make his morning Chyawanprash mixed cold with milk, juice and yogurt, and I make his evening Chyawanprash in warm milk.  In both cases it's about 5-10 minutes of work to prepare.  This is my daily routine.  This is our daily routine. 
 
What he's saying to me is that he doesn't want me to take any of ""his"" Chyawanprash.  He's been saying this to me forever, but I can't wrap my mind around it.  I ask him every time he says it whether what he means is actually that he wants me to make him Chyawanprash every morning & every evening & not have any myself.  I ask him that, and he never says yes.  He never answers at all.  Today he got so mad at me for even asking him if that's what he meant that he felt forced to call me ""asshole"" repeatedly and scream ""fuck you"" at me, and now he's not talking to me. 
 
It's part of my routine of course to have a little Chyawanprash when I make it every morning and evening.  I usually make <lj user=""brningfield"">'s with about a tablespoon, sometimes a little more, sometimes less (if we're running low).  I usually have about a teaspoon worth myself.  I would probably have a little more than that, but I am terrified of this whole drama where I'm not supposed to have any Chyawanprash-- if that's the deal, I don't really understand at all-- so I try to have a very small amount, and not to call any attention to the fact that I'm having it.  A lot of times I haven't had any myself, even though I feel very strange preparing something which I know is valuable to my health as well and not taking any myself because-- of whatever the reason is. 
 
I time and schedule my day every day around this ritual of preparing a healthful drink for my husband.  Every time he says these strange things about it, I feel more twisted & distorted about it.  I have no idea what a sensible reaction to this situation would look like.  I've tried obviously talking him out of the idea that I don't deserve to have Chyawanprash as well.  I've tried submissively making it for him only-- not that he doesn't then enact the same drama about whatever else I've eaten or drank, or the patch of floor that I'm terribly assholishly occupying.  I've tried ignoring the problem and pretending it will go away. 
 
I feel completely lost.  This should be a healthful routine in my life, where I sustain both <lj user=""brningfield"">'s life and my own, but instead it's a confusing mess.  Am I missing something?  Does this make any sense?  What am I supposed to do???"

"event","Cniglic (SHNEE-gleesh) is a language which I found roaming wild in the hills of Lojbanistan. 
 
<lj-cut text=""A description, an introduction, and an invitation."">
 
Lojban is known as a ""Logical Language,"" but in fact beyond its logical abilities it is also a vast collection of many strange odds & ends, a grand attic of dusty antiques & strange contraptions.  One interesting corner of Lojban is its attitudinals, words which are so useful for expressing yourself (especially in text) that they are always slipping into the dialect of English spoken in Lojbanistan.  Lately I have been gently beginning to try to bring this subset of Lojban, and this trick of applying it to the English language, more fully into conscious & public awareness. 
 
Lojban itself requires a substantial commitment to be learned, nearly as much as a natural language, and while it is well worth it (IMHO), it can hardly be surprising that few people have taken that long hard trek into the unknown, just for the dubious intellectual pleasure of speaking to themselves & a few strangers in an utterly obscure (though intriguing) language.  Cniglic is a place where you may dip your toe, and explore one of the most unique aspects of Lojban without having the buy the whole package.  Not only does Cniglic have less than a hundred words, making it a smaller task to learn in whole than even Toki Pona, but because those words are used only to color & flavor English text, you can begin speaking with complete fluency from the first day, using whatever words you know. 
 
So, all you really need to know to begin speaking Cniglic is a single word.  I'll teach you one right now: "".ui""  The word "".ui"" is pronounced ""wee!"" and it means that you are happy!  (If you're happy and you know it, just say ""wee!"")  That's the most basic way to use a word of Cniglic: Just say it by itself, to express how you are feeling.  It's a bit like saying ""ugh"" or ""wow.""  The other main way to use a Cniglic word is almost as simple: You can say it while you're talking about something, and it shows your feeling about the last thing you mentioned.  For instance: 
 
<blockquote>I'm going for a walk [.ui] in the park!</blockquote>
 
Which means that you are going for a walk in the park, and you're happy about walking.  Similarly: 
 
<blockquote>I'm going for a walk in the park [.ui]!</blockquote> 
 
Which means that you are going for a walk in the park, and you're happy about the park.  Incidentally, I use [brackets] to separate the Cniglic from the English-- other people use {curly braces} or (parentheses), or you can use nothing at all, it doesn't really matter. 
 
That's it; you know enough Cniglic to start speaking it with me, if you wish, and exploring this neat little toy which the inventors of Lojban have gifted us.  As you explore more of it, you'll find that while it is quite simple structurally, it is actually quite productive: There are various modifiers which can be applied to each emotion, vastly multiplying how many different qualities can be expressed.  It's kind of like smilies on steroids. :) [.ui]

This population is healthy!  It's just barely starting to get a sense for the space I've given it.  They have to figure out how to use fifteen different bits that make up each character of the picture.  Given its appearance this one seems to have routines that operate separately on the bits that change which letter, and the bits that change the color of the letters-- like where it has lots of Hs or 9s in a row and some of them are different colors.  Their instruction set is being enlarged organically over time with instructions that can more directly attack each bit, so it feels to me like they have a whole lot of improvement left to go."

I found some more stupid errors.  The astounding thing about this kind of programming that I'm doing, is that errors are very hard to see if they fall in a certain territory, because the adaptive power of life is <i>amazing</i>.  In this case I had something spasming around putting ""0 0""s all sorts of places that they shouldn't have been, but instead of politely failing to exist, life put up a stand!, generation after generation figuring out unrealistic-but-actual ways to continue. 
 
Now what I have is a population which is settling down, but it's settling very slowly, it's a feather drifting down flip flip floooo into sanity, and I'm thinking maybe of weighting it somehow.  I'm not sure it wouldn't be a bad idea to take the 2 most common alellel .. allelll l .. (consults google & is astounded when the search box answers his question before he even searches for anything) ALLELES! for each location and just scrap all this supposed diversity.  You know how everything you've ever heard about evolution is about the awesome power of distinction & diversity?  That is total bullshit.  I mean it's true, but also, as someone who's been digging around inside evolution for a little while now, let me tell you, it's bullshit.  Evolution likes diversity like a slap in the face.  You hand it diversity at the last possible moment, after you've got something STABLE, something BIG, something UNSINKABLE, that can handle that diversity.  Evolution likes EVERYTHING THE SAME."

"event","So my new population is doing well.  It has several dramatic improvements over my last versions. 
 
One of the differences is correcting a stupid error.  (You shouldn't hear that as a self-criticism.  Stupid errors are endemic to programming; it's only by systematically overcoming them that anything can be accomplished.)  Like most stupid errors, this one was a result of trying to be clever.  I figured out that I could help my organisms address a two dimensional space by giving them, as well as instructions for ""forward one memory cell"" and ""back one memory cell,"" instructions that take them far enough forward to put them on the same position on the next line, or back on the previous line.  So I had hacked it in that way at some point in the past.  The problem is that then when they go off the end of one line, they come in on the beginning of the next one, which makes it tricky to make shapes.  This time I made it so the memory is truly two dimensionally addressed; going off the right side brings you back on the left & vv. 
 
The other differences are more interesting.  For one, I designed the virtual machine that runs these programs so that it can easily watch which combinations of instructions are popular in the population.  It keeps a running tally over time of how many times each instruction combination has been run together.  New instructions are then added to the instruction set which do the most popular instruction combinations in one instruction, leaving room for them to combine with others.  It's my theory that this will provide a sort of buffer between the basic instruction set I've provided, and the randomness of the mutations.  The handles they're grabbing are progressively selected to be more often the things they like to do. 
 
Another change is that I've implemented a level of metamutation.  What took me a bit to figure out on this one is how to score it.  When I first tried to evolve mutators I had them linked to the organisms they were mutating, which of course made them absurdly cautious!  What I'm doing this time is evolving them slowly, by giving them control of a population and then racing them against each other over generations.  I'm also making a lot of different parameters-- all different kinds of mutation & confusion. 

this is called: ""gone again""

"event","OMG what a rush!

In retrospect I can't justify it, but I've always granted a sort of mythical obscurity to assembly languages.  It's something about the way that everyone tries to scare you away from them-- <i>no one</i> writes in assembly code, they say-- it's obviously for madmen, or at the very least someone smarter than little old <i>you</i>. 
 
But today, after recently exploring Python, Lisp, & C++, I thought I'd just get a little taste of it on my lips.  I thought I'd just dip my toe & see how impossible it was.  I thought it would go something like this: ""Oh, you want to write a program in assembly language?  Well, first you'd better write six thousand lines of gobbledeegook before anything will happen, and you have to write it while standing on your head in a full bathtub singing in fluent Chinese and Japanese simultaneously and if you fuck up your computer will explode.""  And then I'd give up. 
 
But it's not like that at all!  It turns out that I am a perfectly smart person who's spent my whole life with computers and assembler makes perfect sense to me!  It's simple as hell!  And you can tell the <i>real fucking computer</i> to do things, that actual chip! 
 
What a rush!  (It's true once again: You should almost always try the things they tell you not to.) 
 
So anyway here's my code that I'm unreasonably proud of.  First I tried some helloworlds from a tutorial, and then I took the pieces I had acquired & assembled this triviality.  It prints an exclamation point if you press anything except escape, in which case it quits.

Beautiful, ain't she?  I don't think it will be my last."

i'm thinking it might work well with fairy tales.

"event","Well, it has been a HELL of a long time since my last entry. I've read through my previous pathetic attempts at online writing - they did make me laugh, but perhaps that is a sad reflection of how dull my evening has been.

A lot has changed since my last entry. There has been a new man in my life for the last 5 months - he is very lovely, funny, caring and he can cook! What more could a girl want? Well, the possibility of a non-cowboy loft conversion is also attractive, so his recent career change into this area is a clear advantage. 

The workload continues to grow. Occasionally I kid myself that I am getting on top of it all and that things might be slowing down a tad, but actually, all that has occurred is that I have taken a pile of paperwork home with me and decluttered my desk. My list of patients is pretty much the same length each month, the names change from time to time, but my list of additional duties grows - shame the pay packet doesn't grow at the same rate.

I'm grateful not to have been flooded, either at home or at work but I am growing tired of all this rain, then wind, then sun, then hail, then rain .... (you get the pattern). I managed a bit of unexpected sunburn a few weeks ago (I was trying out being a cricket groupie for my new man) but I doubt that I will get the chance to repeat that experience before our so-called summer is out.

Bring back summer 2006, I've barely broken out into a sweat on the central line this year - what is happening with the world?"

"event","Well, the cat bite caused an infection in my hand and I had to submit myself to the services of the local NHS clinic. I arrived relatively early on sunday morning (newpaper and diet coke purchased in advance, in preparation for the expected long wait). I was met by a queue trailing out of the door - yikes! A nurse started talking inviting us to see her briefly so that she could send less urgent cases away. I was about to give up and just head home but decided to see what her response was. She listened to my tale of animal woe and took one look at my hand and ordered me to fill in a form and sit tight - I'd be needing a tetanus shot and antibiotics. An hour or so later (I knew the papaer and drink preps would be useful) I had another nurse giving me the injection and tablets and firmly informing me that if the swelling worsened at all, or spread up my arm I was to go to A&E immediately - surely I couldn't be that seriously ill! I am glad to report that the swelling has begun to lessen today so no emergency amputation has been required.

The other odd thing about my treatment yesterday was that the first thing the nurse asked me was what I did for a living - I'm not sure what it was about my appearance that made her ask that. After she fetched the injection and tablets she asked whether I was just passing through the area, she seemed very surprised to hear that a Notting-Hill based psychologist would be living in Newham - what does she think I get paid?"

"event","OK, so we are post christmas and new year, so I have a little more time to do some writing - for what it is worth.

This week has been pretty good overall. I've been able to see all the good things in my life - kiddies, family, friends, health, career, house etc. Still no partner, but hey, who has a full deck?

The bad things this week have all been animal related:

Thursday night I got home to find that some cat (hopefully not my lovely Patch) had done a very neat, but very smelly poo on my duvet. Not just anywhere on my duvet, but right on my side of the bed, just where I would sit down - thank God I put the light on and saw it, rather than sitting down before putting on the light. The kiddies both complained about the smell but we were out of air-freshener, so they liberally sprayed one of my perfumes around the house. Nice smelling house, but a tad expensive.

Friday morning, there I was, standing at the bus-stop in Notting Hill when I realised that a bird had pooped on my coat. Fortunately it wasn't as messy as the starling poop I had once encountered during life in Brighton, and it had dried, so it was pretty easy to remove. Still, not the image that one wants to project - particularly as a single woman hoping to get lucky en route to work.

Saturday morning. Another stray cat was escaping out through Patch's cat flap so I decided to help him/her by kicking the cat flap. Big mistake! The flap flapped its way outside and under the decking. I managed to retrieve it, superglue it back into one piece and put it back in situ an hour later. In the meantime I used the breadboard to cover the gap - not wanting Siberian winds to whip their way throughout my house. Unforunately I had not realised that the same dammed stray cat had re-entered the house and was now wanting to find an exit route. It panicked seeing the exit blocked and I managed to grab hold of it, but it turned and sunk its fangs into me - God, what a start to the weekend - biten by a wild cat in your own kitchen!

I decided to hit Oxford Street (again) and treat myself, its not everyday that you survive three animal attacks."

"event","Oh what joy - it is time to visit the local secondary schools in order to put them down on a form in order of preference/rejection. This is a complete waste of time really, as it is the local education authority (or whatever they call themselves these days) who eventually decide (by fair means or foul) which school your treasured darling will be attending for the next x years (until they become aware that truancy really is the better option).

Yes, I was very inspired by this morning's school visit - I managed to witness three separate incidents of teachers losing their rag and confronting students with unnecessarily negative and degrading language - all before 10am! Hmm, I wonder where that school will be on my list - will it even get on the list at all?

What joy it is to be a parent."

"event","How much mental health training do medical students get? Just one week of lectures (and a bit of time trailing mental health teams). How much teaching do they get on psychological interventions? Just one 90-minute lecture, from me - poor wee souls! Fortunately my voice managed to last the distance - good thing I took a day off work earlier in the week to avoid a full-on throat infection!

If this is all they get on mental health, how much do they get on other topics? The mind boggles - PANIC!!!!!!!"

"event","OK, I've finally realised that the whole full-time working, commuting, single parent thing is impossible without a clone. Slight problem, I wasn't given a clone when I split, nor did one turn up on the doorstep with my decree absolute. Damn it!

Generally I manage to muddle my way through things and try to catch up on sleep and basic shopping and housework at the weekends. That works fine, but when you have anything more than this to do the world just begins to get too much. At the moment the additional things I am wanting to do are: finish decorating the house, 
clean the house properly, 
move westwards, 
spend extra time helping the kids with their numeracy and literacy, 
work in the garden, 
visit and choose between the local secondary schools for my daughter, 
spend all my free time wither with my new man or with my mates, 
read up on all those psychology topics that I wish I knew more about, 
lose weight and exercise.

OK, so it is a bit of long list, but even trying to do one or two of these so-called extras is enough to reduce me to tears. Life really is too much at times... Hence the need for a clone. Please lobby your local MP on my behalf."

"event","Relieved to report that there are no ear infections. The liberal use of anti-cold meds for 24 hours seems to have killed off any lurking bugs - phew!

Weird week this week. Extremely busy at work, with some risk issues to assess and manage, but so far so good. In mental health we cannot always avoid risks being realised, or suicides succeeding (unfortunate term, but ""success"" is the word that is used in this context). It is stressful to witness people at this level of distress, and stressful to consider whether you have done all you can to assess and manage the risk. Unfortunately, we have the additional stress of having to ensure that we have completed all the relevant documentation, aka defensive practice. Blame is such an unhelpful concept.

Talking of risk, I have grabbed the bull by the horns and informed the old ex that I am dating again - and I am still alive!!!!! The new man also sent me a sweet text message, bless his cotton socks he heads off to bed so early - if only I had that luxury!

Still, life is not all that bad, this evening I managed to meet up with four ex-trainee psychologists and down a couple of glasses of wine whilst catching up on news and local NHS disaster stories. Peer support is the best."

It took 3 hours to drive from Windsor to East London - a journey that should have taken 90 mins on average. Total gridlock around Westminster and then loads of roads closed off with police cars and ambulances with sirens wailing. The whole capital seemed to be in chaos.

Safely back home now with kiddies in bed, lunches packed and washing machine taking the strain. Time for a glass of wine and a period of chill-out time."

"event","Wow! We still have sunshine. I couldn't let all this great weather disappear without another day in one of the London parks, so I dragged my two screaming children out onto the tube. Fortunately when we arrived at Hyde Park Corner they recognised the place and decided that I had chosed well. A few hours later we had snacked, walked, rowed (yippee!), fribeed (its that a verb?), and climbed a tree - well I actually sat on a bench in the sunshine with my legs up whilst the kiddies did the last activity.

We are now back home and since the house is not yet in darkness the lack of completed housework is clearly obvious, so I must attend to it - accompanied by blasts of obligatory U2."

"event","The central line was much more fun this evening. We were treated to that rarest of TFL commodities - a communicative, helpful and witty tube driver. I'm guessing that tube drivers are no longer called by this name, they are probably ""people-propelling operatives"", or something of that sort. Whatever their title, a bit of humour from drivers is very welcome, particularly as it reminds me of a particularly lengthy commute I used to do over the Harbour Bridge in Sydney which was aided not only by the spectacular view, but also by the driver's wacky monologue."

"event","I'm not an opera fan, in fact I am only just beginning to rediscover the virtues of music in general. I became a mother over a decade ago, and along with all the usual sacrifices I found that I lost all interest in computer games (no great loss) and music (significant loss). Recently I have tried to reverse the trend and I am replacing the more important CDs that exited my life with the rest of my ex's belongings. 

Anyhow, last night I met up with my new man (how long is a man new, I ask myself). We drank briefly in the oft-frequented Crusting Pipe wine bar in Covent Garden. As often happens in this location, we were exposed to operatic singing. This was pleasurable in most part but not exactly conducive to conversation. Feeling peckish, we went off in search of food and both decided on risking the slightly OTT/completely insane Sarastro restaurant on Drury Lane (www.sarastro-restaurant.com). Soon after our arrival we were treated to yet more musicians and opera singers. It was pretty entertaining, as were ye olde books, but no serious conversation could be pursued which was somewhat irritating after a while.

Monday morning and I joined the many at work who were not feeling too chirpy about the prospect of a full week of work ahead. The day passed without any catastrophic incidents. I collected my kiddies on the way home, anxious about the return of single parenthood, but able to draw a smile as they chatted happily about various childish topics on our journey back home through the hot and tedious commuting world of the central line."

"event","Well, since my only blogging friend has read and commented on my first post, I am now obliged to try and continue with this scary escapade.

Today is my last day of freedom. Tomorrow night my children return from a 3-week break with their dad. The anxiety was clearly rising last night and I awoke at 4am. After much tossing and turning I managed to return to dreamland, re-awakening at 9.30 (hurray). I resisted the urge to get up and do something productive. Instead I lay in bed and read part of a novel. Usually I struggle to find time to read anything other than psychology books and letters from school (usually about assemblies and school fairs that I have no hope in hell of attending). I was about to give up on this book, feeling that it was a waste of my precious free time, but then a new character was introduced. He was a tramp who had been tortured and who was now being offered a job, accommodation, and even the promise of a new love (only a few pages later). Always a sucker for a sad tale, I read on for a while.

I've finally discovered some good music to exercise to. It is a rare occasion when I have time, energy and motivation to sit on my exercise bike. Even when I do manage to spend some time cycling, I usually find that the music I am listening to interferes with my mood, sometimes reducing me to tears. However, today I discovered that James Brown does not have that effect on me - he is a very cheerful chappie and my thighs and buttocks praise him for sustaining me through a lengthy exercise period.

Off into the big windy city soon for a browse around the shops, a sit down for a coffee and a read (psychology book or novel?). Later on I meet up with my new man - the perfect way to spend a sunday, what more can I say?"

How do we really know what other people think? More importantly, how do we really know what they think about us? If we wait for the other person to speak first we could be waiting forever. However, if we have misjudged the situation and speak first, then we are laying ourselves bare, vulnerable to abuse and attack.

Life is often a game, a game of chicken at times. Perhaps though it is better to play, than to just sit on the sidelines and never to have played at all. So here I am with my first post..."

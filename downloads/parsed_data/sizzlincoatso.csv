"event","I had a photoshoot last night, it was different. My makeup artist put me in black eye makeup that seemed like it went out to me ears and then bright cherry lipstick and teezed my hair so I was like totally eighties. Then for my swimwear  pictures, Kristin had the honors of spraying me down with olive oil and soaking my hair. The pics....all I gotta say is they better be damn good. I looked like the girl, the freaky one, from The Ring. Scary! 

One other point, I know of someone who drops my name to get into parties. I would really like that to stop because you're making yourself look like an idiot and making me look as if I actually know you. It's really just not all that cool yo. So, If you're at a frat and you go...""But I know holly coatsolonia"" it's not gonna do you any good if I'm not with you. Duh"

I was encountered by my boss at Dick's and was chosen (out of all apparel) to go to a Columbia Expo in Cincinnati with her. Learning about fabrication and price techniques and stuff like that. I was so excited cause expo=free stuff and indiana=cold and columbia=warm stuff. plus being recognized is a plus. 

Today I got a call from a recruiter from Sears Corporate and was asked to be interviewed for an internship this summer because'the recruiter was impressed by my charisma and work history'....yeah, I WAS excited until that day looked familiar, oh wait, yeah I'm gonna be in Cincinnati living it up in ear muffs GODDAMNIT. So I just wrote a pity e-mail to the recruiter and explained my situation(minus the fasination in free stuff)....Please please please give me another chance!!!!!!

Um, lets see...Ran out of gas on Tuesday in front of KDR, Had a shoot on wednesday(that went very well), missed my tanning appt. thurday, went to an all frosh party on friday(and bought some massively awesome yellow stilletto pumps that I showed off), saturday Randy came down and I almost got arrested at a party(that was real cool), and yeah.....this week, not so much fun...

ok, that is all....bye now

So, the year has started...and it's busier then ever. With 18 credit hours in classes that I would have looked at my courses my frosh yr and been like....ewww....don't want that....and working(yeah, I got a job at Dicks as their Visual Merchandiser) and Alpha Kappa Psi and My initial laziness....things are getting hectic.

I talked to my Grandma on Sunday and she told me about my birthday surprise...and how it's gonna have to be moved. Why you may ask? Possibly because it was planned for New Orleans. Yep....21 in New Orleans would be fab, but waterlogged, not so much. 

I think I'm alergic to my sheets. I have itchy ass bumps all over and have been (literally) bathing in wal-dryl....yeah i go to college can't afford the benadryl no more. wal-dryl could be from walmart OR walgreens....hmmm, which do you think i did? Pew.

Was gonna go to the pool today but it's nasty and cold(I'm wearing a green plushy turtlenech that I wore to Valpo football games....with khaki shorts cause I couldn't do the whole winter look....and because I have no clean pants...i wore a skirt to my 8:30 and 3tanks and a sweater that was dirty and my hair nastass cause i woke up late and my friends said i looked cute....so not what i was going for)

You hear about Britney yellin at the 13 yr old kid? I would have too if some kid was bashin my sister.....actually, i have....you go Britney. Don't let people bash.

Keith Urban makes my head sweat....Ben Affleck is my head sweat and Matt Damon is my pit sweat.
Angelina Jolie is gorgeous.....I wish I could look like that minus the weird voodoo stuff. Brad Pitt ain't too bad either."

Oh and also, I'm into putting lipgloss on my eyes because it gives them a super sheek look w/ a glossover....but I tell ya what, They get stuck alot...and it might look freaky(I don't know). Maybe I'll get a pic of my stuck eyes and use that as my LJ pic. That would be hot.

And then a bank in Chesterton called me yesterday cause they want me to work for them but I said no.

This sucks....lesson=Don't sell yourself short too soon.

So, looks like I might be going up to Valpo this weekend to do my taxes and maybe a little ass whoopin. Family problems therefore, I decided:

Going to Baltimore for Spring Break. 
Gotta get away
Shop alittle

and then I'll be happy again.

Tomorrow is elections. I'm running for pledge class president for AKPsi. Should be fun.

And, shoutout to Randy for making my weekend great. I love you so much and can't wait to see you in a few.

"event","This week has been a mess...In a good way
Here's a clippet
~I had a relapse about my ex boyfriend (And I know a few of you know about that)but it's fine now. I think it lasted like a total of an hour thank goodness
~I had a downfall about a current guy because he is too motivated and a workaholic.I'm fine with it, but I thought you could make sometime if I'm coming to see you Thanksgiving... Not too hard to guess that one
~I talked to a guy I had a few feelings for in high school for the first time in a while which was awesome. It really took care of the relapse the the other bozo guy. And he's smart and really cool and knows my family which is a huge help...

Oh boy...there's more, but that would get awfully boring. I just wanted to show how you think something is not going your way and then BOOM something completely out of the ordinary happens.

Today is my best friend's Birthday. Her name is Jackie and I made her a cake and ate half of it last night. Whoops...hehe. 

This weekend I'm here alone the whole time starting now, so if anyone wants to hang out or whatever, just let me know....that would be cool

Ok, Outas

<P>Last weekend was fun...I went home to do homework because I knew that if I stayed at Purdue nothing would be accomplished....hehe. I love home, therefore, I talked to my dad and&nbsp;jai&nbsp;about my future and all that jazz. I have come to the conclusion that I am going to get a job in Indy or chicago to get assembled and then if I must i'll transfer to whereever(hopefully the east coast) once I get accustomed to being on my own and company regulations, policy, etc.).</P>
<P>I also figured out while talking to Jai that I'm going to stay in Indiana this summer and work. I had thoughts of going to Baltimore or getting a intership with Macys in Indy or May Company based in DC. But, it hit me that I'm gonna be doing all that next year...lets be a kid for one more year and think about that later. Baltimore still remains an option though....I know one day I'll find myself there...you know me I'm insanely inlove with that city.</P>

<P>Tomorrow I have my scheduling meeting with my advisor. My classes look very...not fun. 18credit hrs of pure business. Whoopee. </P>
<P>This weekend was fun...except for the fact that Purdue lost. How sad was that? You would think they would learn from the Wisconsin game....but nah. Maybe next time(did I say that last week? I think I did cause I'm having a 'deja vu' moment)</P>
<P>I hope this week goes fast. Anyone with me?</P>
<P>Lots of stuff to sort out...therefore, time for me to go.</P>
<P>Holls ....oh and Anyone wanna go to my brothers playoff game sunday in Michigan City with me? It's gonna be a good one....unlike Purdue lately. Sorry Purdue, I couldn't resist. I love you and I still will wear my sweatshirt and attend my classes. Hehe....I'm hammered. No, not really, just coffee</P>"

<P>I'm going to Dayton tonight with Jackie to see her bro. That'll be a bunch of fun. </P>
<P>I think I scored well on my Soc exam today which is a major plus. </P>
<P>Regan is in town. She stopped by last night and was here when I got back from my Acct. exam. What a big surprise! She looks great and I can't wait to hang with her on Saturday. She brought up that I'm going to be a bridesmaid at her and Paul's wedding....hehe. So it got me thinking....</P>
<P>And I called Jai...</P>
<P>And it looks like, I'm not gonna get married ever cause 1% isn't enough love for me to step into marriage. Haha, he was goofin....I think. I know. But it was 0% last year, so I have to be positive and think that I'm actually increasing.....he's loving me more!</P>
<P>One day....long time from now. But it's ok, I have my friends, my family and my clothes .....and I'm happy.&nbsp;Very Happy.</P>
<P>I'm going to Valpo over Halloween weekend. Anyone wanna get trashed with me, call me up!</P>
<P>Until I get home, Have a great weekend, be safe and don't pick up hitchhikers who resemble Jason Campbell.&nbsp;</P>"

<P>Yesterday was tons of fun. My dad and the kids came down for the game and we hung out and laughed and I didn't get yelled at for anything. haha. It would have been a perfect day if Kyle Orton didn't screw up and Purdue won....but it keeps us from our heads getting too big. Next week Michigan...we can do this</P>
<P>Then Jackie and I settled down for what was going to be a movie night but somehow turned into going to Alex's for a party. It was tons of fun except getting home at 4 and then pukin (but it felt good). I forgot how fun those guys are. I know my tolerence level now! I think I have to end when I do the Jager. That stuff messed me up dudeman.</P>
<P>Haha, but it was fun, I had a great time...and now it's time to write a paper, but I'm still feelin it.</P>

"event","Hey everyone, I am very sorry I haven't been around much lately.

I chopped all my hair off...

Sadly to say...that is the most interesting part of my life right now.

The death of Ronald Reagan AKA to Jackie ""Regan DeSalme"" hahaha Jack.....has been a troubling part of my week. Everyone says that he was 93 and blah blah blah, but it really gets me when you think about how great of a man he really was. His successor wasn't his horse, the Russians, his family or even a cancer....it was his own mind and the loss of all the great ideas ond memories that mind had. All lost to  himself but remebered through the people who loved him most.
How terrifyingly sad yet how bittersweet his parting from us was. 

I pray that our generation makes a man like him pull to the surface like oil and water. He was the last of the times...of a time that I should have been a part of but so otherwise blessed to have knowledge of. The men who were like Ronald Reagan to me are 2 of my biggest idols...My Grandpa Kubiak and John Wayne. 

I know my sisters and my mom agrees with me. They had the biggest hearts yet the most boyish sence of political matters. How I wish I could be of their liking and not a day passes in which I don't pray for them and pray formyself to have the wisdom and courage of these brave individuals who led our country into hope and success.


In other news...My birthday is on Saturday. I'm gonna be 19. 
Wow"

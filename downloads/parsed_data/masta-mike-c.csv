"event","Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some Afternoon Delight
My motto's always been ""When it's right, it's right.""
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?

When everythings a little clearer in the light of day?
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway?

Thinkin 'bout you's working up my appetite
Lookin' forward to a little Afternoon Delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbin' you is gettin' so exciting

Skyrockets in flight!
Afternoon Delight!
Afternoon Delight!
Afternoon Delight!

Started out this morning feeling so polite,
I always thought a fish could not be caught who didn't bite.
But you got some bait a-waiting and I think I might
Try nibblin' a little Afternoon Delight

Skyrockets in flight!
Afternoon Delight!
Afternoon Delight!
Afternoon Delight!

Be waiting for me, baby, when I come around.
We can make a lot of loving 'fore the sun goes down

Thinkin' of you's workin' up a' appetite
Lookin' forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbin' you is gettin' so exciting

Skyrockets in flight!
Afternoon Delight!
Afternoon Delight!

Afternoon Delight!

(a madrigal fugue)

Afternoon Delight!"

Things I thought were getting better changed dramatically the other way. Bad news has been my metaphor. All I could use is a vacation, yet when one comes around I need to keep my job. I don't expect anyone to understand, nor care. In the end, fuck it, I have a term paper that's due tomorrow."

"event","Here again, I sit infront of a blank screen not sure of what to say. So many ideas but unable to get them out in a straight line. The puzzling script foils me once again. Worked out new ideas with Bob tonight. Yet that's all we have, ideas. Nothing more, nothing less. Wanted to improv. most of it, but then again we need some direction and we'll just go from there. Wishing that I could bring this computer around with me everywhere. Would make things easier. Too much hip-hop/rap on SNL these days, damn the mainstream.

Working slowly to straightening out my life. Too much trouble for such a young age. Wish I could be more care free. With an extended I'll finally be able to get some work done on my new computer. More or less I can start building it. The old desktop running Win98SE is slowly dying on me. Maybe I shouldn't talk about dying right now. It's physically slowing down, which obviously isn't a good thing. I want, more or less, need XP Pro. Despite what people say about it, it really is an awesome OS. The whole deal isn't as expensive as I was expecting. I'm quite confident that I'll be about to get this deal worked out fully under the ammount of $1,500."

"event","I bet you all will be oh so very confused as to what I am about to tell you.

I, Michael Cole (obviously on the internet,) am reading the Bible. The friggin Holy Book of the Christians.

You may be asking youself ""Why is he doing such a thing as that?"" Well I have an answer. I'm doing research. Not for personal, 'religious' reasons and neither for that of school. It is more for a hobbie I have recently re-instituted in my life. I am or will be doing some other ""out-of-character"" things as well. My good friends (John D. and Bob) and I are in the process of working on a movie script, which we will self- produce, act, and whatever else needs to be done. This film of ours is underconstruction at the moment since the idea isn't older than a week or so. It's kind of a side career idea we've got going on. Mutually agreeing on the fact that horror movies are the easiest the produce and have a nice small and tight budge, it was the perfect idea. Some of the basis on it is a 'rip-off' of a bunch of older films (ie: Dawn of the Dead, Evil Dead 1-2, Army of Darkness, and so on..) We figure Bob and I will be the main characters, and later on we may be asking countless friends and friends of friends and friends of those friends to play the role of the ""LIVING DEAD"" or what have you. A lot of extras will help, this will be a non-paying gig. I know this still doesn't answer your question about why I skimming through The Bible. I getting to it right now.

You see I want an introduction to the film that really, <b><i>REALLY</i></b> grabs your attention. You sometimes see movies where there's an intro with a quote from an actor or someone being portrayed in a re-enactment. Kevin Smith has done a little thing about platypuss' and etc..

I figure what better place to get a whole quality quote from is <a href=""http://www.nccbuscc.org/nab/bible/index.htm#revelation""> THE BIBLE. </a> I indulged in the book of Revelation as my link has shown. Seeing as this movie is a glimpse of the end of the world, what better section of the holy book than the last one.

 Well better get working, gots to visit Bob at our work, lame. and Then off to visit Katie Baca later tonight, call me. <3"

"event","Well, I just had my heart ripped out of my rib cage today. I called her on Saturday when I got off the train, she was busy and told me she'd call back later. Sunday comes around and I have a little down time at work so I give her another call to see what is up. But she's with people so I let her go and waits for her return call that night. Nothing until today, just a few minutes ago. No emotion what-so-ever. Just, ""I need to do this for myself"". We're not together anymore. This literally kills me inside. I'm at my lwoest point right now. I'd do anything, absolutley <b>ANYTHING</b> not to lose you babe. I don't want this to end. It can't. I thought we promised, fucking PROMISED to stay together forever. All those wonderful, meaningful notes I've kept for over the past year plus. I guess they mean nothing to you, don't they. I'm baffled, heartbroken, angry no furious, unbelievebly sad."

If you hear the song you'll know what I'm talking about. This guy is a fricken' genious, I wish I knew about him years ago. If you listen to WASP- Loco-Motive Man you'll hear something similar to what a couple of guys I know and I are working on. This revival. 'No Love For Killer Babies.' What a joke. Hoping this thirty-thousand isn't a waste, what a horrible end. If all goes well no more minimum wage. 'No Love For Killer Babies.' Nervous, yet physched. Happy, yet cautious. Not a big fan of the city. Everything is just too close to one another. I need my space, although it will only be about 18 months and I should be done, hopefully. Got a little personal goal at hand. Hoping to leave my parents house, get a place on my own even with some friends Hannah is definately MORE than welcome. This I want to achieve by either 24 or 25. Four to five years isn't bad. I just feel like I should be out on my own. If all goes well I shouldn't need to be living with my parents for more than two or three years or so. (What he says does NOT sound like what is written.) What an idiot I am, it's not <b>Bring</b> Your Own Computer but <b>Build</b> Your Own Computer. Exciting, know? The funny thing is I've been planning on doing that anyways.. eventually. Not like work really pays that much. Which reminds me, I've got to start a pass-book savings fund soon, for school and what-not. *And The Meek Shall Inherit The Earth* Wow, haven't written like this in.. well ever."

"event","I scare myself shitless this evening. My sister brings in the mail when she got home and I get a letter, and the first I see on it is ""Settlement Administrator"". I think to myself, ""ok, this is some kind of legal document."" I start reading and find out that there's some lawsuit again Microsoft about how they monopolized certain OS' and programs between the dates: JANUARY 3, 1996 and DECEMBER 31, 2002 and while residing in Massachusetts. The Judicial system has never been my forte. So I end up reading it a few times, making sure this isn't a suit against me for things I may or maynot have done onine. Etc., etc., etc.. They're getting sued ""for a maximum of $34,000,000 in hardware and software vouchers for Class Members."" --Interesting--

Last night was fun. Nothing beats a little bonding at the Salisbury Skatepark. Nothing big happened, a little one on one photo-shoot. Bob has a nice camera, making me jealous.. Maybe I'll kill him for it...? Hahaha! Hope the pictures came out alright. I'm not the best, or even decent photographer, just a little hobby I kind of picked up after acquiring my father's old manual 35mm. If anything is post worthy I'll try to get it scanned on here or somewhere available to the public.

Meanwhile: ""Predator"" is in the making. John, Bob, and I a few nights ago rocked it out in Dirkes garage for the first.. or maybe second time. It was quite awesome. Our METAL revival band sounds good for only having part of one song written. That is until Bob's infamous idea of ""Hand-gun Havok"" is brought to life. But that won't happend for about another week, with John on his way down the Florida. What a bastard!"

"event","With all of these retro- age bands coming up from the depths of the mainstream, it's about time some good 70s metal came back. <b>All Hail Bruce Dickinson!</b> Half of ""Blank Society"" and I, think, are trying to start an Iron Maiden/ W.A.S.P. type band. I mean where have all the solo's gone. Most music doesn't tell a story, it's more of an audio version of LiveJournal floating through the radio waves. 

It was awesome a few nights ago. Hanging out with Bob and John, no agenda (besides billiards) just cruising and laughing. Similar to Dave Chappelle's skit ""Dudes night out""."

"event","Last night, almost killed a dog on Route 1a. Hannah screamed bloody murder as well. It wasn't a pretty sight either. The dog wasn't dead, or at least in the middle of the road. On my way to check to see if it were, and I was planning on going to the house nearest to ask if they owned a pet, I believe I saw it walking off in the woods. Hopefully not to go off and die. I do feal really bad though. I may seem like an ass, but when it comes to something some one could have loved I know what it feels like.

Only worked for three hours today, but am going in tomorrow for the other five for truck. Apparently it was delayed until Tuesday now, go figure. Pool with Bob wasn't bad. Won a few, lost a few pretty much how it goes every time. Two man cut-throat is awkward, don't ask. Before that we went to GameStop and I got Halo, used, for only two friggin dollars. Nice deal, considering for what I traded for it: GTA: VC, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, and a few PS1 titles. About time I got rid of them. He wouldn't take EverQuest: Online Adventures for PS2, so if anyone wants to buy it from me, I'd be much obliged."

Been to alone for too long, it's nice to have someone you know that feels the same way about you as you do for them. Just for tonight, this time, I felt like being alone. I'm sure you didn't, but It's nice to have an alone night once and a while. Get things done around the house and what-not.

"event","So band practice wasn't bad, worked on ""Rush - 2112 Overture"". It's starting to sound much better. Finally John brought his shit home to actually work on it. Broke a lock to my stool so I can't really use it until I get a new lock, or just get a new seat all together. Don't know about that, they're expensive little things. As well as the hobby itself. But I don't know what I would do with out it sometimes. Thought to myself a while back about just selling my kit cause I knew the band wasn't going very far and I can only play with these people for the moment. Yet being as lazy as I am nothing really ever happend.

   Each day I get off from work when I don't accomplish something, anything, it feels like I'm worthless. It's a hard thing to cope with. When you know right now, one year ago, you would be in some boring old building learning useless information about some dead artist, or poet, or revolutionary not having a care or penny in the world. Then comes the freedom, after over a decade of this institutionalization (whoa, is that even a word???) you have no idea what to do with yourself. When I'm running around some little pharmacy getting paid little over minimum wage to do things my supervisors are supposed, get's tiring. Every week it's the same routine, Sunday through Saturday. But I AM living the life I want. Not something my parents would have half expected.

   Yeah, if you are wondering, I'm still living with my creators. The way I see it, it's free room and board, and that'll I should take advantage of it as much as I can right now. They don't seem to mind my presence here, so I guess I'm on some right track. But then again, I wish I had my own place. You know, somewhere I wouldn't have to worry about ANYONE bitching how frigging lazy and messy I live. A place to bring the woman home to when we spend a day together, and just be able to do whatever, where ever and not have to worry about anyone walking in on us unexpected.

   Heh, don't mind me. I'm just rambling on about nothing really I suppose."

     Last night was good, band went through the first part of the ""2112 Overture"" and it's sounding a lot more better. Then once everyone left had some nice alone time with the woman. I can't wait for this summer; parents going away for a week or so. Maybe a skate trip or two, who knows? All in all I think it'll be a good one, hopefully.

For a stupid fucking check that was up in the office where it belonged. That was within the first hour and a half too. So that initially started the day off crappy. Not to mention the most WONDERFUL people that come to shop there, it's not like they help at all to be the most sincere beings.

Although when I first picked it up at a friend's house it was on XOBX. Besides my small disgust for Microsoft, the controls were unbearable. But I later took it up on the PS2 and it just felt SO much better. Haven't finished it yet, but planning on it soon. I'd have to say I'm about half way through.

The look, HUD, game play was all very, VERY similar to it's predecessor. Yet the story just got worse. I was even embarrassed to be returning it the the rental store chain that is closest to my house. 

Before I picked up SOCOM 2 I had taken out SECRET WEAPONS OVER NORMANDY. From my extensive knowledge of the gaming industry, I knew this one was going to be a flight sim., and that it was partially based off of the series of Battlefield 1942 (which by the way isn't that bad of a game, especially online.) The controls weren't as 'loose' as I was expecting. Each plane had a different feeling to it. But yet agaim, the story wasn't that appealing to me.

Was hanging out with Will and Bobby today and we were discussing the project again, probably for the first official time. Discussing the who was going to get a 'full part', and who was going to get a 'friend's' part. Also the music was of much importance, obviously! Hip Hop/Rap was decided out, in a sense. We're going to try and keep it to a more rock or metal sounds (punk will not be outlawed.) Trying to keep it real to our area, well actually more like our tastes.

I was just thinking to myself that, and was partially talked about by Bobby and I, that we shouldn't use only one editing machine. Meaning that: one person can work on the, montage, introduction, credits, and that the indiviual parts will be split up between how many ever will be working on it. But the part that I had just pondered was the individual parts. They should not be done by the person that is in them. For example: John will not work on his own part, nor will Bobby work on his own part. I don't have a real specific reason to that way of thought, but I figure it won't hurt. Hopefully.

I am hoping that I can get each of the participants in this film to be able to show up at a pre-designated place to discuss this in a little more detail, and god-help no distractions. For music will be a good thing to try and figure out. That way each editor will know what to look for and will not be going out to Newbury Comics last minute to by a ""Slayer"" CD. And for this way we won't have conflicts of either same band and/or song. Let's try to mix it up a little guys!

Well I guess that's it for now.

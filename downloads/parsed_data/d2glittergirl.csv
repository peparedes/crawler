"event","I laid back on my purple velvet chaise lounge and closed my eyes.  I could feel him.  I could smell his cologne.  His morning shower could not mask the scent of the girl he had made love to the night before.  Vampires can sense these things.  He was on a plane headed to England.  I could not help smiling.  He would be here soon enough. 

   ""Simon...""  I whispered.

   Simon shook as he bolted up in his seat.  He was gasping for air.  ""Bloody hell.""  He yelled.

   John and Nick ran back there.  ""What's wrong, Simon.""  Nick asked.

   ""I can't take this.""  He said frustrated.

   ""Was it her?""  John asked.

   Simon nodded.  ""I could see her laying on this purple velvet chaise lounge.  Her eyes were closed.  She looked so peaceful.  I saw her and I heard her say my name and then it was like I couldn't breathe.  Then I woke up.  Why is this happening?  Who is she?""

   ""Hey John, would you get Simon a drink please?""

   ""You got it, mate.""

   Nick sad down next to his friend.  ""What does she look like?""

   ""She's got long wavy brown hair and the most incredible emerald green eyes.  Her lips and fingernails are blood red.  She's always dressed in black.  She's so real, Nick.""

   ""I can imagine by the way you describe her.""  Nick said.  ""Let me ask you one question.""

   ""Okay.""  Simon said softly.

   ""What makes her different from all the others?""

   ""There's something more there.  I can see it in her eyes.  I've never felt like this about another woman before.  It's like I see peace in her eyes and I want more of that.""

   ""Well, I can't blame you for that.""

   John returned with a drink.  ""Here you go.""

   ""What's this?""

   ""Amaretto Sour.""

   ""Thanks mate.""  Simon said taking the glass.  He took a big gulp.  ""Mmm...nice.""

   John smiled.  ""Thanks.""

   ""Just do me a favor.  Keep me occupied as much as possible.  If I can keep my mind on something else then maybe I'll be okay.""

   ""I think we can handle that.  Come up front with us.  We'll get something to eat.  I hear this airline food is quite the delicacy.""  Nick said laughing.

   Simon smiled.  ""Thanks.""

   The guys walked up front.  They went over the tour itinerary with Michael, anything they could think of to keep Simon's mind off other things.  They had some atrocious Beef Stroganoff.  

   The guys wanted to believe Simon.  It was such an odd thing.  How do you explain Simon being haunted by some girl in his dreams?

   ""Oh my god.""  Andy said.

   ""What's wrong?""  Roger asked.

   ""Nothing.  I just have an idea for you, Simon.""  Andy said.  ""Write about it.""

   He handed him a notebook and a pen.  A smile came across Simon's face.  ""You are a smart little Taylor.""

   ""Hey, watch that little stuff.""  Andy said playfully.

   ""You know I need ya.""  He said smiling.  ""I'll be in the back.""

   ""Simon, are you sure?""  Michael asked.

   ""No.  I don't know what the hell is wrong with me.  All I know is that we have shows to do and I won't let whatever this is interfere with that.""

   ""Okay.""  Nick said.  ""We're up here if you need us.""

   ""Thanks.""  Simon walked in the back and sat down.  He pulled down the tray table and started writing everything down.  None of it was making any sense.  He was just writing to write.  Then all of a sudden he looked down and there was his song.  It was perfectly fitting.  He smiled and wrote Careless Memories at the top of the page.  He couldn't wait to show the guys.  He got up and walked up front.

   ""Hey there.""  Andy said.  ""How's it going?""

   Simon sat down next to him and handed him the notebook.  Andy's eyes lit up when he was done reading the words to Simon's new song.

   ""Oh man, you did it.""  Andy said.  ""You've got to read this, Roger.""  

   Roger took the notebook and read it.  ""Simon, that's really good.""

   John, Nick, and Michael read over it too.  Andy grabbed his acoustic guitar.  He never went anywhere without it.  After all, you never know when you're going to be inspired.  He tried a few chords and before they knew it, they had a full on jam session going at 35,000 feet.  

   ""Okay, this is not fair.""  Nick said.  ""Writing when me synths aren't here.""  

   ""You have plenty of time to play with it, Nick.""  Simon said.  ""What do you guys think?""

   ""It's incredible, Simon.""  John said."

"event","""What is time?""  I have asked myself this question many a night, many a year, many a century.  You see, I am a vampire and I am alone.

   For centuries I have walked this earth in search of the one destined to be with me in time.  After each failure, I begin to lose hope a little more...till I saw him.

   He has the bluest eyes of crystal, such that you could lose yourself in for eternity.  He had sandy blonde hair to his neck.  I dreamt of what it would be like to taste him, just once.  Everytime he sang, his words just seemed to wrap themselves around you and pull you in.  He was English and a pop star.

   I stood there on the top of the Eiffel Tower, holding on to the rail.  My long wavy brown hair blowing in the night wind.  I had to meet him.  I had to know him.  I had to have him.

   Simon Le Bon bolted up in bed.  His heart was racing and his breath was short.  He looked down at the pretty young girl next to him.  She was barely covered with the sheet.  She began to stir.

   ""Go back to sleep.""  He whispered.  Suddenly he realized that he didn't even know her name.  

   He placed a kiss gently on her lips and she laid back down.  He got up and slipped on a pair of black silk boxer shorts.  He went out on the balcony and lit up a cigarette.    He couldn't get the girl in his dream out of his mind.  She was so beautiful.  It was more than that though.  He knew if he told the guys that they would just give him a hard time, a beautiful naked girl in his bed and dreaming about being with another girl.  That had to be some kind of record, even for him.

   He rubbed his eyes and looked out at the streets of New York City.  Why would he dream about a girl that he had never met?  Maybe he was just tired.  It had been a long three months.  The pace of the tours got to him sometimes, but he still loved it.  They were leaving in a few hours for England.  It would be great to be home.  It was only for three days, but he was grateful anytime they got a chance to get back there.  Then they were heading to Europe for a month.

   Europe was always like a vacation to them, exotic locations and girls everywhere.  Secretly he longed for someone he could share his life with.  He knew there was something he was searching for, that he still hadn't found.  

   The image of the girl from his dream popped into his head again.  She was dressed in black and her long jacket was blowing in the wind.  She had long wavy brown hair and emerald green eyes.  Her eyes seemed full of pain and loneliness.  It almost seemed as if she was searching for something too.

   His phone rang and he looked down at his watch.  It was 5:30 a.m.  It could only be one person.  He glanced inside at the girl asleep in his bed.  She didn't even move.  He grabbed the phone.

   ""Hello Michael.""   

   ""How did you know it was me?""

   ""It's 5:30 in the morning, who else would it be?""

   ""Just wanted to make sure you were up.""

   ""I'm up.""  

   ""Get packed and meet us in the lobby in an hour.  Now might be a good time to ask your lovely guest to depart.  We have to be on a plane to England in two hours.""

   Simon smiled.  ""Yes sir.""

   ""Enough Simon, don't make dragging the lead singer pop star down to the limo part of my managerial duties.""

   ""Hey, I have to do what I can to keep you busy.""

   ""Go get ready, smart ass.""  Michael said laughing.

   Simon laughed and hung up the phone.  He went inside and took a shower.  He wore some black slacks, a white button-up short sleeved shirt, and some black slip on loafers.  He packed his bags and set them by the door.  His lovely guest hadn't stirred once.

   He walked over and sat down beside her.  He put his hand to her cheek.  He leaned down and kissed her gently on the lips.  She slowly opened her eyes.

   ""Hi.""  She whispered as a warm smile crossed her lips.

   ""Morning, love.  I have a plane to catch.  I'm afraid I have to go.""

   ""I wish you could stay.""  She said looking down.  He thought about how many times he had heard that phrase in the morning before he left his current hotel and beauty behind.

   He smiled and leaned down.  He kissed her hard this time.  ""Feel free to go back to sleep.  Check out is at twelve.  I had a great time.""

   She tried her best to smile.  ""Thanks, I did too.  Have a safe trip.""  Simon grabbed his bags and left.

   As soon as the elevator doors opened, Simon couldn't help smiling.  There was the band's road manager, Michael Monroe.  He was pacing back and forth by the hotel's front doors.

   ""What's wrong, Michael?  I told you I'd be here.""  Simon said smiling.

   ""Get your sarcastic, late English ass in that limo, Simon Le Bon.  We're going to miss the damn plane.""

   ""Alright, alright.""  Simon said.

   They walked out front of the hotel.  There was a silver stretch limousine waiting for them.  The chauffeur took Simon's bags and he got inside.  Michael climbed in after him.  Andy, Roger, John, and Nick were sitting up front by the windows.  The limo pulled out and headed for the airport.

   ""Morning, lads.""  Simon said.

   ""Did you let that pretty little bird stay in your suite.""  John asked.

   ""I couldn't just throw her out.""  Simon said smiling.

   ""Yeah, I'm sure...after a good shagging.""  John said laughing.

   Simon threw a pillow at John.  ""Stop John, she was a sweet girl.""  John gave him that raised eyebrow that had made him so famous with their female fans.  ""Okay, she was sexy as hell in that little purple mini-dress and those heels...she was little wild cat in bed.  Damn it, why do you do this to me?""  Simon said looking out the window.

   ""Do what?  Make you admit that you enjoy your bad side?""  John said laughing.

   The image of the girl in his dream popped into Simon's head again.  The guys would never understand.

   ""What the matter, Simon?""  Nick asked.  He was impeccably dressed, even at this ungodly hour of the morning.  A black pinstripe suit, a lavender shirt, a black tie, and not one hair out of place.

   ""Always checking up on me.""  Simon smiled.

   ""Well, someone has to.""  Roger said.

   ""Hey guys, I hate to interrupt.""  Michael said.  ""I mean, we all know how interesting these debates of who's sex life is better, Simon or John's are.""  He laughed and Simon hit him in the arm.  ""We'll be at the airport soon.  We are booked first class on British Airways.  It should be clear of any fans  at this time of the morning.  Just stay together, we have to get to the plane.""

   ""Right-O, boss.""  Andy said.

   Simon was grateful for the change of subject.  He rubbed his eyes.  He was tired.  He just wanted to get on the plane, have a drink, relax, and get some sleep.  They would be home soon enough.

   They pulled up in front of the airport a few minutes later.  There was a huge crowd of beautiful girls for as far as they could see.  He knew normally he would be loving this, but not today.

   ""Bloody hell, what do we do now, Michael.""  Andy said.

   ""We have no choice, but to go through it.  Just stick together and we should be okay.""  

   ""I never get tired of this part.""  John said with mischievous eyes.

   The guys filed out and the girls surrounded them in a second flat.  Several girls had their hands all over Simon.  He tried his best to smile, but he couldn't think of anything else, not today.  He looked out at the sea of girls' faces and his breath caught in his chest.  It was her.  The wavy brown hair and the emerald green eyes.

   Suddenly, she turned and began to make her way out of the crowd.  Simon couldn't let that happen.  He split off from the guys and did his best to follow her.  There were girls everywhere.  He finally got free of the crowd and ran to the end of the walkway.  He looked down to the level below.  There was a crowd of people near the door.  There she was, she turned and looked back at him.  She smiled and then disappeared around the corner of the building.

   Nick, Andy, and Roger came running up beside him.  ""Simon, what's going on?""  Nick asked.

   Simon was still staring at where she was standing just moments ago.  

   ""Simon.""  Roger said.  ""Snap out of it.""  Simon looked up at them suddenly.  Michael and John ran up.

   ""We don't have much time before a riot begins.""  Michael said.  ""Get your asses in the airport and we'll talk on the plane, Simon.""

   The guys hurried back through the frenzied crowd of girls into the airport.  They were rushed through security and on to the gate.  They all got on the plane and rushed up to first class.  They got comfortable and the plane took off a few minutes later.  They had booked all of first class, so they were alone.  When they got to a safe altitude, the flight attendant brought champagne to everyone.  Michael got up and sat down across the aisle from Simon.

   ""Okay Simon, you want to explain to me what the hell that was all about?""  Michael asked him.

   ""Yeah Simon, what the hell happened?""  Andy asked.

   Simon rubbed his eyes.  How was he going to explain this to them?  He sighed.  ""I had this dream last night.  There was this haunting girl.  I can't get the image of her out of my head.""

   ""So, let me understand this.  You had a beautiful naked woman next to you and you're dreaming...""  John started.

   ""Oh leave him alone, John.""  Roger said.

   ""There's more you're not telling us.""  Nick said.

   ""I don't know.  Every time I close my eyes, I see her.  When we got in the crowd at the airport, I saw her.  I know it sounds weird, but it was her.""

   ""Simon, you said it yourself...you're tired.  It could be just your mind playing tricks on you.""  Michael said.

   ""You're right.""  Simon said.  ""It could be that, but I just know it was her.  These dreams are so real.  There's something different about her.  She's elegant and god she's beautiful.""

   ""You're in love with a girl from your dreams?""  Roger asked.

   Simon put his head in his hands.  ""I knew you guys wouldn't understand.""

   ""It's okay, man.""  Andy said.  ""I believe you.""

   Simon looked up and smiled.  ""Thank you.  I know it sounds weird guys, but there's something going on.  I know it.""

   ""Well, whatever it is...we'll get through it like we get through everything else...together.""  John said.

   Simon smiled.  ""Thanks guys.""

   Michael gave Simon one of his sleeping pills so he could get some sleep.  He gave him a blanket and a pillow.  ""Try not to think about her, Simon.  Close your eyes and concentrate on the fact that you'll be home soon.  You'll get to see your mum.  It'll be great.""  Michael said.

   Simon smiled.  ""Thank you, Michael.""

   ""It's going to be okay.  We'll be right up front if you need us.""  Michael walked back up front and sat down by Nick.

   Simon leaned over and looked out the window.  The clouds looked like soft pillows.  The sky was a rose tinted blue.  It was incredible.  He closed his eyes a few minutes later."

   Simon leaned over and looked out the window.  The clouds looked like soft pillows.  The sky was a rose tinted blue.  It was incredible.  He closed his eyes a few minutes later.  

   I laid back on my purple velvet chaise lounge and closed my eyes.  I could feel him.  I could smell his cologne.  His shower could not cover the scent of the girl he had made love to the night before.  Vampires can sense these things.  He was on a plane headed for England.  I couldn't help smiling.  He would be here soon enough.

   ""Simon.""  I whispered.

   Simon shook as he bolted up in his seat.  He was gasping for air.  ""Bloody hell.""  He yelled.

   John and Nick ran back there.  ""What's wrong, Simon.""

   ""I can't take this.""

   ""Was it her?""

   Simon nodded.  ""I could see her laying on this purple chaise lounge.  Her eyes were closed.  She looked so peaceful.  I saw her and I heard her say my name and then it was like I couldn't breathe.  Then I woke up.  Why is this happening?  Who is she?""

   ""Hey John, would you mind getting him a drink?""  Nick asked.

   ""You got it.""

   Nick sat down next to his friend.  ""What does she look like?""

   ""She's got long wavy brown hair and the most incredible green eyes.  Her lips and her nails are blood red.  She's always dressed in black.  She's just incredible.  She's so real, Nick.""

   ""I can imagine by the way you describe her.""  Nick said.  ""Let me ask you a question.""

   ""Okay.""  Simon said softly.

   ""What makes her different from all the others?""

   ""There's something more there.  I've never felt like this about another woman.  It's like I see peace in her eyes and I want more of that.""

   ""Well, I can't blame you for that.""

   John returned with his drink.  ""Here you go.""

   ""What's this?""

   ""Amaretto Sour.""

   ""Thanks mate.""  Simon took a big gulp.  ""Mmm...nice.""

   John smiled.  ""Thanks.""

   ""Just do me a favor.  Keep me occupied as much as possible.  If I can keep my mind on something else than maybe I'll be okay.""

   ""You're going to be okay anyway.  Come on up front with us.  We'll get something to eat.  I hear this airplane food is an acquired taste.""  Nick said.

   ""Thanks.""  Simon said.

   The guys walked up front.  They went over the tour itinerary with Michael, anything they could think of to keep Simon's mind off other things.  They had some atrocious Beef Stroganoff.  

   The guys wanted to believe Simon.  It was such an odd thing.  How do you explain Simon being haunted by a strange dream girl."

"event","yeah today was no better.  Shawn left in the morning so Im stuck with Jason.  Then Gabe tells me that Metro has friends and plans to jump Hippo.  THen  i stupidly let hippo go out for a jog with his dog alone.  Then Gabe calls metro and tells him that Kevin is out alone.  So then I got hella worried.  Then Steven comes down and tells me that Metro and like 6 of his friends were unconcious down the street.  Hippo came home with a limp and a bloody nose.  Now im getting harrassed by his cousin, she thinks Im him, so now shes like being a bitch to me (no offense).  Just a bad day"

"event","yes it has been an eventful day.  I spent the whole day in school worrying about hippo.  He wasnt his normal self today, he was really sad.  Its his eyes that r the worse, normally they r happy looking and filled with life, but today they just looked really sad.  When we got home I just talked to bathwater and her sister.  then Kevin went for a hour and a half jog which turned out to be just about an 8 mile jog.  I was so worried about him bcause hes never been gone that long, and theres like he could of been jumped by bus and his friends or George and his friends or something.  But unless they had like 15 kids or something Kevin would of beaten them, Idk how badly they would of beaten him, but he would of won in the end, bcause he had his dog with him and he would of been a fucking beast protecting her.  Then when he got home I went downstairs and idky I just started yelling at him.  I was like screaming at him about how worried he made me and how selfish he was, and his eyes kept growning sadder and sadder.  Finally he just hugged me and said he was sorry, and thats when I realized what I had done.  I felt so fucking bad, u can  not believe it.  I seriously felt like i had impaled myself through my stomach.  When he got out of the shower and I went up and apologized him.  God those eyes just made me wanted to cry.  He just turned and looked at me when I apologized, and then he just gave me a big hug and said ""Michi, I understand how u felt, theres no need to be sorry, Im really sorry I made u so worried and I thank u for caring about me"", then he just kissed me on the top of my head.  Hes such a fucking sweet kid, it hurts me alot to see him so sad, but neways I feel alot better now.  I still feel really bad, but I guess Ill talk on this later.  Bye"

"event","Yay yet another complicated day.  First off I get this hella long report to do in English.  yay, then I get home an my mom starts apologizing for last night and I really didnt want to deal with it.  So after this big discussion with her I left and came over to hippos.  Everything was going good until Hippos dad called him.  I have never seen hippo so mad as when he came back.  Hippo is a kid stacked with muscle, and he was so mad that all his muscle had tensed up and his body was fucking shaking.  He had tensed his muscles so much that when I tried to calm him down by giving him a  hug, I couldnt fit my arms around his shoulders.  Then I found out that his dad had threatened to put his dog to sleep if he (hippo) didnt have a C average for this quarter.  he was talking to bathwater and that was the first time I have ever heard him say he was going to kill himself, and he fucking meant it.  So then he started pacing and I finally got him to sit down by telling him that he was scaring all his friends.  And Hippo has always comforted me when Ive been down, I mean IVe been suicidal and Ill just talk to him for like an hour and hell listen (thats rare among people these days) and offer me support and just make me feel good and Ill be happy, so I went over and tried to comfort him but I had not clue what to say so I ended up just sitting there hugging him and not saying nething.  I started apologizing for being such a bad friend, but he gave me a hug and said I was great and then thanked me twice for being there for him.  Oh yeah Meg Nikki and Cat he thanks u guys for ur support too.  hes still pissed, but hes calming down, I feel hella fucking guilty about not being able to help him, but I guess he said thanks. Ok thats all for me. Bye"

"event","ok hippo is now on journal, under retarded _hippo.  If u read his intro, u may notice that hes very unsure, hes just really modest.  He is a great friend, and he did help me through tonight.  Secondly I just wanted to share this with all of u. Hippo will probably deny it, but neways.  I went in the other room to go look for something I dropped.  I opened up the closet and in this box on the top shelf were like 6 boxing trophies.  Each one had hippos name on it and they were all like second and first place trophies.  I just thought Id share that with u guys, bcause that is pretty cool to me.  u may notice my status has changed from angry to gratefuul, thats bcause I feel grateful bcause I haev hippo as a friend, bcause he comforted me tonight."

"event","ok my first entry and Im doing it on a bad note. today was a fucking horrible day.  I had to spend the whole day after school at my friends house.  She was being a bitch, she wouldnt get off the fucking phone with her friend and wouldnt talk to me at all. I ended up doing all the work for our fucking project.  Then I get home and one of the guys I know called and I guess said some shit and my mom got alll over me.  Basically she called me a slut and said she was dissapointed to me.  This was the first time my mom has even been mad at me. I was so fucking shocked.  So I left, this is at like 9 oclock our time at night.  I came over to hippos house, the professor (another one of hippos friends) was on the computer and he was saying all this mean shit about hippo. then i took a look at who he was talking to and he (the proffessor) told this girl whos hippos friend that he thought that she thought hippo was repulsive and ugly and very bad bf material.  For neone who knows hippo this is the opposite of him.  The thing taht pissed me off was that this girl, never once denied her saying that.  So then the professors saying that this girl agreed with him on the fact that hippo is repulsive bcause she never denied saying that he was.  So then I get more pissed bcause hippos had a bad week what with his Chem teacher and Bus and now this, and no matter how happy he seems I know that shit has to hurt him hard inside.  SO then I started crying and hippo just took me into another room, and told me he was there for me, and he just sat their and listened to me as I told him about my day and he apologized and just told me how great of a person I am and how it wasnt right that that shit should happen to me.  I feel alot better now.  I guess Ill catch u guys later"

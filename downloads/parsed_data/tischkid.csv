"event","I'm not sure that I had ever actually taken the Jung Typology test before but the results are in and I'm a definite ENFJ - Teacher Idealist...which is a group comprised of just 2 percent of the population...meaning we're either very special or just very strange.

While I understand that many of these personality tests are as self-fulfilling as your average daily horoscopes, there seemed to really be something to the descriptions I read of this particular personality type. Moreover, I found an eerily accurate description of the major issues that broke Stacey and I apart in the relationship section of the description. Apparently, teacher-idealists encourage other people to tap into their own passions and thus achieve their full potential. And while this is considered a very admirable quality, it can sometimes cause them to expect something of their partner which, if not fulfilled (or at least attempted), can lead to a feeling of frustration, disillusionment, or even betrayal.

Can we say nail on the head? 

Anyway, that was my interesting self-discovery this evening. Life continues to ebb and flow these days with very little to comment on which is why I haven't been particularly (or even occasionally) verbose lately. The random times I am encouraged to put words into the ether I choose more often to put pen to paper and fill the pages of my real life journal instead of sitting to my keyboard. 

And now to bed...

"event","I know most of my friends don't stay entertained by more than a couple minutes of any televised sport let alone invest themselves the way I do...but a few of you will understand...and the rest of you, just accept my quirks as normal - they're not changing.

It's really hard to watch KU lose. It's even harder to watch them lose by one point. It's even harder when they have a chance to get a shot off with 6.7 seconds left and they're hacked inside but no foul is called. I realize that it's a shitty way to end a game - free throws, that is...and I would be pissed as hell if I was the team up by one...but a foul is a foul, folks. I don't understand why it's so hard for this basketball team in particular to play solid during the first half...ever. If they were equally as faulty in the second halves I could understand...but they're not...they're consistently not. It makes me sad.

I was proud of Jeffrey tonight though. When Mario was taken out by a flagrant foul, Jeffrey came back in and made the two free throws and then drove the ball to the hoop for two more on the ensuing possession. That's excellent senior leadership...way to go J-Hawk!!!

It makes me sad to watch the Mets lose too...but they usually give up 5 or 6 runs early and play catch up the rest of the way...you sort of expect that when you go out to Queens...ah well, this is still a very young team and it's very early, but I will definitely cry ALL SUMMER LONG if we don't make the tournament because we lose every game this year by 1 or 2 points."

My laundry is done and put away. My Scrabble record is above 500. I'm reading plays, annotating Emerson, and getting a lot done at work. That all amounts to a generally satisfied Nathan. 

I should audition more. Maybe after this slew of readings dies down I'll realize that there's still a ton of work to do to get where I want to be. 

Saw the final dress of ""The Color Purple"" with Nicole and her stage manager friend on Monday. There's still a ton of work to do, but they have a show which is pretty exciting. Nice change of pace to see a stage full of black people doing something other than Smokey Joe's Cafe or an August Wilson play these days (Note: this is not to say that I wouldn't love to see an August Wilson play any night of the week). I think Nicole has a boyfriend, but she seems very enthusiastic about us being friends and she's fun to be around.

Nice conversation with Abbey the other night...first normal one in awhile. I liked that.

"event","An excerpt from Ben Brantley's review of Terrance McNally's latest play, Dedication or The Stuff of Dreams.

""But when 'Dedication' has to make its case for why theater matters, words fail it. 'I think if we can reach one child, just one, it will be worth everything,' Lou says. Now compare that statement to Mrs. Willard's definition of children's theater: 'Grownups desperately trying to hold the attention of a hostile audience.'

Looking like a scalpel-edged Duchess of Windsor, seemingly too rich and too thin to live, Ms. Seldes's imperious Mrs. Willard delivers such lines with a crisp self-satisfaction that never entirely disguises the self-contempt beneath. She achieves the great Mephistophelean glee of that chicest of Disney villainesses, Cruella De Vil, as she mocks the do-gooders of the world. 'Save the whales?' she exclaims. 'I say eat the whales! What has a whale ever done for me?'

At the same time, though, she gives such acute immediacy to her character's physical pain that it becomes the play's central reality. 'I'm dying, Lou, and so are you,' Mrs. Willard says. 'That's all it comes down to, on stage or off. Tell your children that.'

Even the most brightly lighted, colorfully ornamented stage scene would fade against the compelling shadows of Ms. Seldes's rendering of this assertion. The theater, you think, has lost out to the forces of darkness, after all. That is, until you happily remember that it is the dramatic skill of a quintessentially theatrical actress that is making you think this way."""

"event","Yep, it's official. Today I officially feel like an adult. A man.

Stacey used to talk about what kind of man I was...a man with my ambition, a man with my talent, blah blah blah...but it always felt strange. A couple days ago Erin, another friend of mine, talked about dating men in reference to people my age and even younger. But today that awkward feeling has drifted away...

I installed an air conditioner in my room today. It was a bitch! I first had to remove the iron bars which had been fitted into the second track of our window frame, but the screws holding them in place were rusted to the point of not being removable. So I had to use my hammer and screwdriver and chip away at the bracket holding them in place and finally pry them out. Then I had to lug an 80 pound air conditioner back to my apartment. I knew the installation would be tricky because of the type of window frame we have...but after careful consideration and a bit of planning I figured out what extra materials I would need from the hardware store to make this unit work in my window. I walked down to the Ace Hardware on 100th & Amsterdam and had them CUT ME LUMBER! A big first, I must say. Found the right screws and while they didn't have the longer bolts I wanted for the make-shift back support they did have bricks which sit nicely on my outside stone sill to make up the height difference. Came back and put it all together. Five hours after my decision to tackle this project today I was sitting in the 72 degree breeze of my very own air conditioner sipping ice water and snacking on frozen grapes. Ah yes, this is the life.

Then we know that we have blossomed into a fully functioning human being who can not only think and decide things independently, love and hurt, make love and cause hurt, but also install our own air conditioners."

Anyway, just thought I'd drop an e-line and say that a recent correspond-whatever has made me smile a lot lately. No romance, no subversive hopes/dreams/desires...just a cool friend who I'm glad I've gotten to know much better over the past couple of weeks...and all through the beauty of the Facebook. 

So if you're sitting around with nothing to do today, start writing a letter to someone. (It can be email if you just can't spare the ink and the stamp) It can really change a persons outlook."

Well, I changed the internet face of Nathan to the new LJ/Facebook/HotorNot pic that you see now. All comments are welcome. Krystal seems to think it makes me look ""less classy and less like yourself,"" but I kind of like it. I was just getting tired of the cheesy headshot really. I also managed to make $22 profit playing online poker today. I should stop and do something more productive (mostly so I don't lose that money as I bore with the game)...so I think I'll journal for a bit and then hopefully find a great movie on TV tonight or something. Lars and I signed up for NetFlix and I'm really excited about it...but I wish they'd hurry up and send us our first three movies!

So that's my life. Tomorrow is LOTS of laundry, dropping pictures off at the agency, lunch with Kat, and reading in a reading. At least it will get me out of the house.

The past few days have brought many things. New experiences. New people into my life. New points of view. That said, I guess I still don't have much of an idea what I want. Scratch that. I don't have much of an idea how I would rather exist in my current state. What I want has been well documented since May - in daydreams, latenight conversations, eyelash wishes, and ironic fortune cookie messages. 

I've always been the most open person I know. Willing to tell any story about myself because in the long run it seemed easier than to keep secrets. I'm not sure what parts of my recent story are worth telling. I haven't quite figured out what they mean to me yet. Most of all I feel like it was all a big lesson. I can't remember a time when the world and it's events seemed more like a big classroom to me. But at the end of the day, a lesson is mental...not physical...does that make it less real?

My aunt bought me a journal for my birthday this year...I tried journaling my freshman year of college. It became sort of pathetic...all work, no play. I suppose I could try again with my first full summer in NYC ahead of me. It's been quite the kick-off weekend, but what if this is it? What if this was my crazy week and then I waste this journal because the story doesn't continue? What if new chapters aren't written?

Her roomate caught my attention too, but she wasn't feeling well and the aforementioned girl was bubbly and joking around with me. What did I find out today? Any takers? Come on, it's classic early 20s NWN... she, of course, has a boyfriend. Damn, damn, damn, damn, DAMN! (ref. Rex Harrison)

So...so much for the church girl...but that's okay. I'll give a little more attention to the roomate (we actually just had a nice phone convo) and see if anything is going on there. I just want a nice girl to date. A nice, fun girl who likes me and I'm interested in. Just to hang out and see romantic comedies with and hold hands and lay on blankets in Central Park together...maybe this time, for the first time...or at least in a while...

Life is still great though. Playwriting group boosted my spirits immensely. A woman saw what all of you who love me have seen for years. She came up to me after and asked me if I was doing anything right now. She said she could see my spark and that I should stick with it because I had something very special inside of me. YES! NYU didn't kill it! So now I have great craft to go along with my spark...now it's time for a little luck to go along with my persistence...that is, after the summer...

"event","<lj-cut text=""Interview by Mr. Dunlap"">
1) Which do you prefer most, musical theatre or traditional?

Tough question because I grew up doing musicals. Thing is, there are probably more roles for me (at this point in my life) in plays. That said, while I love smiling big and doing a billion time steps down on the front line, my most rewarding experiences in musicals have been in shows like West Side Story. You are living something more akin to real life every night.

2) What is your favorite NYC location? (be exact, don't just say downtown, or Central Park)

Joe Allen restaurant on 46th street can brighten my day like no place else. The counterpart to Joe Allen's (which is typically a night spot) would be the rock where we sat at the lake in Central Park...I can doze there in the sun for hours.

3) If you were only able to choose one of these as your only source of entertainment and information: Books, Television, Music, or the Internet, which would you choose? (This is with the condition that books would NOT be availble online, nor anything dealing with TV or music and vise versa for each and all, just strictly their ""classic"" content)

And by classic internet content you mean...porn? I'm going to talk around your question for a bit. If I went into this world now two things affect my decision. One, can I take my memories with me of books/music/etc I've previously encountered. And two, am I alone (like stranded on a desert island)? And I guess, three, do I get the complete set of said media? (ie all books ever written?) Taking those into account...if I could live my life with another person and remember everything I've known I would choose books. Books inspire thought for me more than music and those thoughts could be turned into discussions with my companion. Music is an emotional journey for me...and if I get to keep the music I know, I can recreate that for myself...I would have a hard time recreating Anna Karenina for myself in my head, however.

4) What is your favorite place to eat in the state of Kansas?

Another good one...I wish I had some little roadside diner story about Kanorado...but I don't. My favorite place to eat in KS would have to be Houston's. A close second, however, is Winstead's.

5) If you had the ability to make just one thing happen, anything, before midnight tonight, what would it be?

Run into a woman I could spend the rest of my life with tonight and get her phone number (I could go on with and this work out, and that work out, but you get my point). That's the only thing I would change about my life right now. 
</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""Interview by One Ms. Jasinskas"">
1. What is your favorite scabble word?

L-I-Q-U-O-R-S is a good one. Or E-L-I-X-I-R-S. Both use high point letters and get a 50 point bonus for using all 7 tiles. I'm also a fan of -ING words.

2. If you had to be secluded from the rest of the world (ala monk or something), what 3 books would you take with you to satisfy your intellectual and emotional needs? 

Scarlet & Black, The Little Prince, Complete Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson

3. What do you look for in a performance?

Two words. Emotional Journey. I want to be moved (joy, tears, fear, anticipation, whatever) and I want to end somewhere different from where I began. 

4. What do you hope to achieve in your own performances?

Same thing. I want to take the audience on an emotional journey. I could say something like, sing B-flats with ease which might make it easier for me to get parts or better reviews...but honestly, I've been moved most by people like Michael Rupert, Chip Zien, and Bernadette Peters...actors who have the blessing of a musical score supporting their text.

5. NY forever? Or NY for a while and somewhere else to settle down with family?

NY for awhile. I don't have (and never will have) the kind of money it would take to raise a child the way I would want in Manhattan. That said, I would love to expose my children to the city and all it has to offer. Who knows...I can barely tell you where I'll be six months from now let alone five years down the road. I find it (although less strictly these days) difficult to meet people in the city. That said, I can't imagine going back to KC as an adult to meet people...where? Church?!

<lj-cut text=""Exlusive Interview by Jennifer Rust"">

NOTE: I'm saving #1 for the end because I find it the most consequential and I will probably write the most on it...and I want you to actually read my other answers too... =)

2. If being a baseball player had worked out, what would you want your number to be? 

*11 (some memories never fade...while he didn't turn into the star we had hoped, Jeff Hawkins the star Sabre still has a special place in my heart.)

3. What is the ""perfect"" role for you? 

*Good question, mostly because perfect can mean so many things...especially when it's in quotes. I have to say the role I would most like to play someday in the future would be the Emcee in Cabaret. For now, though, the perfect role for me today is John in John & Jen. 

4. If you were offered the aforementioned perfect role with the chance to sit down with the director and control all of the little aspects that you think would make it really memorable for you, but you wouldn't get paid for the show and you would have to move to Idaho for a year, would you take it? 

*In a heartbeat. Although this is existing in your perfect utopian hypothetical world...because my union wouldn't let me do it without being paid, the greedy bastards.

5. What do you think is more important, the process or the end result? 

*In all areas of life except for one I say the process is most important. It's about the journey. The full experience. In terms of acting, I love the work as much as the peformance, just in different ways. Few moments in life are as sacred to me as watching a scene come together for the first time in a rehearsal hall...no audience member gets that. The one instance where the end result reaches leaps and bounds beyond the process - making a baby. While I love...and I mean love...certain sexual acts, nothing can compare to the result of such a gratifying process. 

1. If you had the past four years of your life to do again, what would you do differently? (i.e. was NYU your best choice, would you have made huge sacrifices to stay with Stacey knowing what you know now, etc)

*And now the biggie...I've given this a lot of thought today. There are a few tiny things/moments regarding Stacey that I would have done differently...but they are kind of inconsequential today. I wouldn't have asked her to drive me to OK to audition for a show just because she had a car and would do it for me. I wouldn't have made the final phone call this summer...but most of these things are things I would change because of lessons learned. Therein lies the key. There are definitely days (more often than not actually) where I wish that Stacey and I could be together now. We've both learned our important respective lessons. She learned that to be truly happy in a relationship you must be yourself from day one. All of yourself...not just part of yourself. Otherwise, you start hiding the other parts of yourself because you're afraid your lover will not love those parts too. I learned to value someone who loves you unconditionally...not many people will. I learned what a relationship means to me. I learned about co-dependence inside and out. I learned not to judge people by their ambitions, but by their passions (which are two totally different entities). Here's the thing...had I stayed with Stacey, I wouldn't have learned those things. That much I feel confident about. Had I not learned those things, I would not have been happy with Stacey...perhaps I would have had less lonely nights, and some amazing times along the way...but while I lost one of the true loves of my life, I gained knowledge that will make life with the next so much sweeter and healthier. Now, to really answer the question you asked, about what I would have done differently...honestly, just one thing. I would have eaten lunch at CAP freshman year rather than going back to my dorm. People at CAP enjoyed my work and thought I was a sweet, sweet guy...but it took almost the entire three years for them to get to know the real me. Some of the best friendships were formed in the lunchroom at CAP freshman year and I think I did myself a disservice by going home and trying to juggle keeping in touch with KC (the city, that is) rather than plugging into my new social circle.

"event","I did something today that I don't think I've done in over fifteen years. Tried to reason with God. Not with the idea of God or my relationship with God...but actually reason with him/it/whatever. Man to Eternal Creator. When I was, say, four and a bit more ballsy I would actually try to trick God with reverse psychology. If a thunderstorm was brewing about the time I wanted to go out and play I would deviously look to the heavens and coyly (is that a word?!) remark, ""Gee, God, I'm so glad you're sending me this thunderstorm. I've been wishing for a thunderstorm all morning. I can't wait for the rain to start."" In my head, God would hear my remark and think, ""What a selfish little boy! I'll show him...no rain today! Mwahahahaha!"" I suppose this brings two things about my past to light...one, I was out of my mind...and two, even then I thought that God was out to get me. Yes, you can thank the good old Southern Baptist Church for that neurosis, where the motto is, ""Jesus has got your back - but until he comes you better well watch your step, mister!"" Anyway, as I walked back from lunch today I started thinking and actually entered into my first bargaining discussion with God in some time. It went a little something like this.

N: So...God...
G: Nathan?! Nathan Norcross?! Is that you?
N: Ummm...yeah. So...God...
G: Geez, kiddo it's been awhile! 
N: Yeah, about that...
G: I'd almost forgotten how many hairs were on your head...

(No seriously, here comes the point of the post)

N: I think we need to have a little talk about retribution.
G: Retri-who?
N: Paybacks.
G: Ah...
N: You see, I realize that I was a self-centered, fairly heartless, asshole of a playboy there for awhile--
G: Yeah, I think that's the exact quote from the Book of Judgement.
N: Lucky guess...anyway, and I know that I probably wouldn't have realized the error in my ways without losing everything I had in that area of my life and learning what it meant to live without it.
G: Score one for the big guy upstairs.
N: Duly noted.
G: Thanks.
N: HOWEVER, can we talk about how long that must have been? I mean, come on! Maybe three years. 
G: But there were so many--
N: So I was busy. 
G: Point taken.
N: My point being...isn't my payback period over yet?! Come on...an eye for an eye, man...um, God.
G: You must learn to not take this so personally and turn the proverbial cheek.
N: I only have four cheeks and none of them are proverbial, okay? At least give it some thought.
G: I don't think, I know.
N: Right. Well, maybe you then also know that I all I want is to share all this passion and love that's inside of me with someone else who is willing to share their passion and love with me. That's what I want. I know now, that that's what I want. I know. You know. Let's work on this, shall we?
G: I'll look into it, metaphysically speaking. Peace out.

"event","And so a new wrinkle begins today...In just 90 minutes I will start my catering career. I was a little nervous for my first day of Princeton Review, but it turned out that I had nothing to worry about. Today's trepidation, however, seems a little more valid in my mind. At Princeton, for instance, if I make a mistake I can just go back and fix it without a large group of coworkers and customers staring over my shoulder...but if I pour red wine down the front of a Lincoln Center debutante, I think the reprecussions might be a bit more severe. We'll see. Everyone tells me that it's not so bad...fun, even. Cross your fingers for me (I'd cross my own, but I'm sure they'll be full). 

In other news I had a day packed with sporting and such yesterday, not to mention some work at TPR and barely making a Julliard recital in the evening. My softball team lost our second game last night 8-5. I was the last out and it's still killing me. Granted, I came up to the plate with two outs and a runner on first. Our coach yelled to me as I stepped into the batters box that a walk would be VERY helpful as I tend to do well on the basepath. I nod and take the first pitch. Ball one. Great. Second pitch is inside. I back out of its way. Let me make this very clear...I pulled back my stomach and watched the ball cross the plane of the plate a good 8 inches inside. Strike one. WHAT?! I almost lost it. ""Are you kidding?!"" I said back to the ump. Then decided to check myself as this was a corporate function...no need to be ejected from a TPR softball game. Okay...one and one...as the ball leaves the pitcher's hand I hear behind me from the ump, ""I'm not going to call a walk. Not in this league."" WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT?! I compose myself just in time to see the ball come across a little outside. At this point I figure...well, I better get to swinging. Of course, as I'm totally out of my element from this situation I hit a grounder right up at the pitcher who was quick enough to grab it (after a little bobble) and toss me out to end the game. I'm still kicking myself for not letting that one go. At least I learned my lesson. All in all, the game was okay. I made a few great plays and the other team respected me as a player...that's all I can ask for, really. Maybe a win next week...

In related news, I scraped up my knee pretty bad during the game and after cleaning it up this morning I realized that we have no hydrogen peroxide in our apartment. I can't believe I went this long without realizing that it's never been here. The other thing I couldn't have imagined living without (which we do) is scotch tape. As my Grandpa affectionately hackled me growing up, ""Boy, you must have a brother in the tape business!"" Yes, it's true...I used about as much tape as ketchup. I suppose we all can adapt. But hydrogen peroxide is definitely on my list of errands now.

He arrived at the bar just a bit later and we kicked the party into higher gear...and I've got to say, in the birthday hug I got/gave last night I felt every one of my friends who called/emailed/even thought about me today. Wednesday night I went to Aliza's birthday party and I felt that same love when Jenny Beck ran up to hug me just after I walked into Central Bar.

Last night I went to the reading of Stephanie and Merissa's new musical (I am SO glad I randomly remembered on the subway). It was nice to hear where they are in their development process...some really terrific things going on and they had some great people reading. I saw some of my former classmates which is always kind of bittersweet. Something about Mike is so much more distant than he ever used to be. It was nice to see both Matts......I guess it's harder than I expected to take Michael Raine's advice about not judging your career by your friends' careers. I came home, though, enthusiastic about writing and reading and creation, etc...then Lars wanted to play video games (which isn't necessarily a terrible distraction)...so I managed to beat the game we had been working on...then came the poker (which also, can be a bad distraction but wasn't going to be...it was still early). Then came the phone call. 

I used to think that songs like ""Not a Day Goes By"" and ""Time Heals Everything"" were beautiful musical theatre hyperbolic expressions...but they're not. Don't get me wrong, I have many things to be thankful for...and I realize that. But if my life wasn't already frustrating enough thinking of her everyday...lately I have seen two movies about past girlfriends coming back into someone's life to fuck it up and I went to the Bernadette concert which was full of songs - songs she used to sing to me, songs that meant something to us, songs that express what I'm feeling now. Beautiful concert, breathtaking really...but it was a long bus ride back to the city. But none of this mattered because last night I was filled with the energy to focus on my work...for REAL this time...and then the phone call came. It's strange because I think I knew. The call wasn't her, it was Sean. He had talked to her. He had talked to her because I had asked him to call her and let her know that my grandmother had died. They both loved her. Buried with her grandmother between the pages of her Bible is a picture of she and I. She had a right to know, but I couldn't call. I ended up calling Sean back to find out the details but after getting the message the tailspin had begun. I just kept playing and playing and playing and playing poker. I didn't lose huge sums of money, mind you...but when I sat down at 10:30 to play one game and then don't stop until 4:00 because at least in that world there is some order...I know what to do. I know when to act and when to fold. Sometimes I get burned and sometimes I get lucky but at least I can know that I am doing things right in my own mind.

BUT-

Today is a new day! 11:17 of a new day, granted because I had to get some rest after staying up all night....but today is a NEW DAY. I changed my desktop for a reason last night and today I can stick to that reason. I can go to work, make the money to pay my rent, and come home and read a play...or two...or three. I can write a scene...or two...or three. I can call an old friend, or two, or more. You get the idea. I know how she felt now. I completely know. I used to think the question she asked me that snowy December night so cruel, but if she came back into life...now I would ask the same question. It's time to shower and live for today. Live for spring and sunshine and work and possibility."

Only two of us were intently watching two separate TVs.

It was relatively quiet when my vocal outburst filled the room.

He made no sound.

I put on my coat and came home. What a relief. What joy. I actually almost cried on the sidewalk as I made my way to the subway. SO much was released in that outburst. So much angst, pressure, frustration, nerves, and love. 

Oh yes, it was a good day."

"event","Sometimes I think twice about posting something about my life that's good or bad...like it's self indulgent...but this is my JOURNAL! What else am I supposed to write here?!

The other thought I had this morning was that I also tend to wait until something huge happens to write about it, rather than letting you know the baby steps along the way. Now, I'm not going to start telling you about every audition...but if something excites me, even if it leads to nothing, at least you will know that SOMETHING is going on. I like to think of it as validating the mile markers along with the exits.

So, in the spirit of all that...life is good! I got over my slight social anxiety and went to the NYC Playwrights group for the first time this past Wednesday. I ended up reading stage directions for a full reading (which only happens once a month - normally it's just scenes and such) and I had a blast. Met lots of  great people who invited me out to drink with them afterwards. There was a girl named Sami who was out of control! So much creative energy, I don't know how she does it...but she seemed very cool...and very talented, I'm sure. Also met another writer/actor named Duncan who has a pink and purple LJ that you should definitely check out. His name is King_Duncan. 

Yesterday I went to two auditions and then a seminar called Empowering Your Career at Equity about agents. They brought in three agents to talk to us and it was very informative. I wish Frank would do something like that with his business class. Anyway, I strategically placed myself in the second row in the center to be very present but not look too eager (man I read WAY too much into this!) and just generally have a good seat. Two of the agents had to leave early so they avoided meeting people afterwards...but the other guy of course had people coming up to introduce themselves and such after...as I left we were headed in the same direction so I thought I would thank him for coming and as I walked over towards the door he actually approached me! He asked my name and asked if he knew me and I said, ""You do now!"" He asked me to send over a headshot and resume!!! Baby steps, folks...that's what it has to be about.

Then I saw ""Grand Hotel"" which was this year's third year show at CAP. Awful choice in my opinion, but some great performances. Saw Caitlyn (sp?!) again, a third year who wasn't in the show who I keep running into everywhere. And I got to have a great chat with Jason Tam who landed Arpad at the Guthrie! I would really love for Jason to read Stephan in ""Traditionally Speaking"" so it was good to reconnect with him again. Hopefully I can get something informal together just to hear the play next month. Went out after the show to Rachel Perry's (who was in Grease) birthday party and met a lot more cool new people who just moved to the city a month ago. This really has been a great week for socializing!

Today I'm going to juggle working at Princeton, Friday Freebies at CAP, seeing Chris and Adam's reading that I wish I could have done, sending off headshots, and probably more drinking. Seeing Alter Boyz tomorrow because they're papering for press. BIG KU game on Sunday afternoon. And Sean comes next week!

Oh, and Lyric called yesterday...that was nice."

"event","The bar I was at last night was SO loud. The only experience that rivals it, really, is being at an intense Sumner/Schlagle basketball game. It's totally not my scene but I had a good time. At least I was there with a large group so there was a big pool of people for me to dance with without worrying about going up to a ""total"" stranger. Also, I don't regularly hang out with people who go out dancing, so it was nice to actually go and do that again. 

In other (similar news) a girl last night assumed that I was straight!!! =) This is a huge deal in NYC...for me. I mean, there are still the other ten people who assumed I was gay and one of Lars' work associates who wanted to put his penis inside of me...but really, you've got to appreciate the small victories along the way."

"event","How's this for the universe going back to balance...

One week ago I sat in this very seat after a terrible audition wanting to kill a particular pianist who ruined a big audition for me. This morning I walked into that same audition room at the same time to find that same pianist looking sheepishly in my direction. I had no qualms, seriously. Had I been handing him the same song I might have been ""singing a different tune,"" if you know what I mean. As I approached the piano he said, ""I know you. You sang Tom Sawyer last week...and I butchered it."" Now, I could have said, ""Yes motherfucker you did and now I think I'll go see if any little blind girls from across the street could play my song because I feel better about them than another go with you."" But I didn't. I calmly said, ""It's fine...I think we'll have a better run today."" And I genuinely meant that. And we did.

Good audition. Good reaction. Good conversation after.

What a difference a week makes.

=)

P.S. Happy St. Valentine's Day to all my special people around the country. Celebrating love is such a happy thing, even if you can't go home and have hot sex tonight..."

I wrote Sean a five page letter about things and Jen a six page letter about some other things...but to keep it short...Monday completely drained me...two terrible auditions that I had no control over and I definitely needed something to refuel me. I thought it had come last night in the form of a friend asking me to be a part of a reading...finally, a chance to work on a project! So I checked it out with Equity this morning and I thought it was going to fly...but now it's not looking good.

Emerson said that the universe kept things in balance...where's my balance? I guess it comes in the form of not having to work much this week...but even that seems to be more of a curse than a blessing right now. 

What am I doing with my life? I'm not quite sure...the scary thing is, I can't imagine doing anything else...

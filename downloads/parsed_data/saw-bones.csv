""The League can stay out of it - they don't have to sully themselves with this dirty business, and they can go back to leaping tall buildings in single bounds. The JSA can go back to helping get cats out of trees. The Titans can stick with trying to find ways to diddle each other. There's an alternative."""

"event","<p>Department of Extranormal Operations.&nbsp; A government agency created specifically to police metahuman activity in a world overrun with them.<br /><br />Every day, there's a new crisis.&nbsp; A new smattering of property damage, frantic panic and demands on resources.&nbsp; The job is never done, and it's always intense.<br /><br />Which is why Director Bones can justify conducting business while getting a full-body massage, from a woman who is paid extra to deal with giving a guy with transparent skin a rubdown.<br /><br />""No, Sarge, I can't pull the Squad off their mission in Azerbajian to deal with that mess in Volcan Domuyo.&nbsp;&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I'll send another platoon or two as backup for you, though, and I'll throw some cheese at those League rats to get them to pitch in for free.&nbsp; Yeah, gotta like a volunteer workforce.&nbsp; I'll be back in touch in two hours, so hang tight.""<br /><br />Then, he glances to the woman greasing him up, creating a weird little sheen over his back.<br /><br />""Yes, she's really hot.""&nbsp;&nbsp; She gives a wry grin.<br /><br />""Get back to work, Sergeant.""<br /><br />The earpiece is plucked out and chucked across the room.<br /><br />""I tell you, Charisse, this job sucks, and it seems to go on forever.&nbsp; What I wouldn't give for a happy ending sometime.""<br /><br />A momentary pause, before Charisse responds.<br /><br />""Flip over, and I'll see what I can do.""<br /><br />His head tilts, and he glances up at her again.<br /><br />""This job is great.""<br /><br /></p>"

"event","So I was on AIM tonight looking at some profiles and I saw a link to a livejournal account.  I figured since I literally do nothing in Arizona but work, sleep and make trips to Chipotle I might as well start this whole shit up again.  Then I figured if I'm going to sit down and type a liveJOURNAL I might as well make it a journal, since about 3 people are going to read it anyways.  

Since moving to Arizona almost two months ago I realized how much I miss family, friends, and familiar faces.  Since I only hang out with about 2 other people whenever I'm not at work I have alot A. LOT. of reflection time to think about all the familiarities that I have been missing.  Even the friendships that I took for granted in high school and even grade school for goodness sakes.  

People like Colin, who was a really good friend the first half of high school, but then we started to drift apart as time went on.  Of course we always had HALO as a connection, and I made it my perogative to make it to as many shows of The Rickets as possible, something just fell out.  Then when I talk to Colin a week ago I found out how kick ass he is doing in his life right now.  I find his drive so incredibly impressive.  He goes to college, holds down a job to pay for his housing so he could get out of his douched out room, and still finds enough time to write and play his music.  I wish I had a tenth of his talent or his drive.

Then there are people like Tim Magaw.  Tim-motherfuckingkickass-Magaw.  Tim and I were never extremely close friends, but we had some good times throughout grade school.  Like when we went to Loyal Oak Lake and he didnt want to go in because it reminded him of Friday the Thirteenth.  Or when we played Sega Genesis at his house until we passed out, then his morbidly obese beagle Toby slept on my head.  Especially all of those years watching Tim take his anger out on the basketball court. Then when I stumbled upon Tim's livejournal earlier I realized that he has his passion and his life seems to be so laid out.  He has his music, which I live for by the way, his college career seems to be starting off extremely successful, and he has a girlfriend, Leslie, who I have never met but seems to be a perfect match.  

These two outstanding gentlemen are just two of the reasons I miss home sweet home.  Not to mention the numerous others like Michael Mure, who is selling his third CD at Tower Records while attending Harvard, Grant Rotunda, enough said because everyone loves Grant,  Nate Sargent, Rence, Andy Christopher who is in the Fucking Naval Academy, so on and so forth.  All the while I bitch about a 40 hour or so work week with plenty of time off, and doing nothing with it, except drinking and playing golf.

On the other hand I look at some of my other peers who astound me with their stupidity and ignorance.  After a lengthy talk with the Elms one and only Ellen Oldfield I have compiled this list of things that piss me off:
Greg Hilkert-  He is a genious, and such is his demise.  I know I may have some rebuttles on this one but take a look at the facts.  he is so naturally smart and gifted that he pisses me off. He is in the honors classes at Akron U, something admirable, but he spends his time partying with people like Kevin Willse, getting drunk and doing fucking Coke.  Coke for God sakes.  We arent talking about the caffine bevrige.  The addicting, illegal and lethal drug.  He could probably solve world peace in about 5 minutes but instead he is figuring out how to steal DVD's from Best Buy. Enough about Greg damn it.
Kevin Willse- for Coke... big surprise there... and for taking advantage of people like AB and Tappy.  If he causes those people any harm through his stupidity I swear I will do nothing short of take his life.
Matt Morrow- for getting a DUI...  I'm fine with drinking, but don't do stupid shit like endanger other peoples life because you feel the need to be an idiot.  Oh yeah, and for doing Coke... a reoccuring theme.
Courtney- none of you know her, because she lives here in Arizona, so I will just move on from that one
People with cars- I'm probably not talking to you here, unless you are an shithead that feels it neccesarry to honk or yell shit at pedestrians when they are walking to Chipotle, Safeway, or Chevron, all places I have to walk to because I am not ortunate enough to have a car.  Dont take your car for granted.
Insomnia-  I have been suffering from a recent episode, if you could actually classify it as such.  I usually don't fall asleep until around 5 A.M.  I don't usually work until 2 P.M. but still, it makes me feel like I waste the day when I wake up at like 10 A.M.  
Being Skinny-  I know I am in the minority on this one but I would much rather gain weight then loose it.  I was 140 pounds when I came to AZ, I have been here almost 2 months and lost almost 10 pounds.  Fuck that.
Tobacco-  Something I have admitted to VERY FEW of my friends is that I habitually use tobacco products.  I started smoking at school.  The food service industry is plagued by tobacco use, probably more then any other industry.  (that is a complete opinion, I have done zero research on the subject)  I don't need a lecture on the dangers and idiocy of the product, I just need. to. quit.  
Green Thorns- A little pleasure of Arizona.  Little thorns that you can't see until you step on them, then start bleeding because of them.
Servers-  The servers at work who think that because they are older then me they know how everything should look and be arranged.  Fuck off.  Tell someone who cares, and guess what? It's not me.

Whew... that feels alot better to get off of my chest.  I know I really shouldent complain because I am doing something I love, something I am relatively good at, and I have alot of fun doing.  I am less then 11 months away from graduating college with an associates degree and I have complete backing from family and friends, which I thank you all for.  I just need a vent every now and then like every other normal person.  I love you all and miss you and look foreward to seeing you all in June and July.

P.S.- Its goodxlast4ever = good times last forever, just in case you didnt figure it out.  I'm only writing this because I looked at it for a second and didnt remember what it was."

<P>Well, I'm not writing anything long, just a few things. My dad is checking into Cranbrook, which I will never be accepted even if we had the money, and he is also checking into gettting me into HS this next school year, which we all know is also impossible because I am a complete... BAKA! Hahaha I haven't said that in ages... anyways...</P>
<P>Uhm... Yeah? Danny came over last night and kept me up til fucking 4 in the morning. That's one thing, but damn ya can't get me back up at 8:30 the next morning! It's summer, that means 12 hours of sleep everyday. Duh. It was... worth it though? Haha. Damn she almost got me in trouble lol we were sitting in mah closet and my dad came upstairs and asked us what we were doing... he was like way suspicious the rest of the night everytime I came downstairs he would ask us what we were doing. What were we doing? I don't remember... nothing that serves to make someone suspicious though right? I mean come on I would never... and she's a girl even! Yipes. Oh fuck though is she my gf? Erg don't remember.</P>
<P>Ok my memory is dead and I'm dead so I'm gonna go float in the pool and then take a long nap. Ja!</P>

"event","<P>Last day of school. Depressing, really, I'm going to miss everyone lots. I mean, some I will see over the summer, some I will attempt to see but will be turned down, and some I won't even be able to contact. It's sad.</P>
<P>So, first summer plans: Go skating. Of course. Then, take the ACT, go see Laura and maybe have Danny over Saturday night. MAYBE, her dad has been being the biggest bitch lately. But he always is. He hits her. I feel bad, but I'm not really sure what to do and if it's my place to do anything at all. I feel obligated to though. -_- We'll see.</P>
<P>Today sucked though, while the two other classes in our team watched Shrek and awsome movies, we watched 2 movies that are so old I have never even heard of them. Mostly because&nbsp;our teacher is an old bitch that lives in the early 1900's or something. There was pizza and pop being served in the hall though I didn't have any, Kenny was bothering me, wanting to talk to me alone about some bullshit but luckly I was saved by a lot of people who came and interupted him. Sadly he talked to me after class and on the phone when I got home but oh well, I simply blew him off and recited every word from a Tenchi episode I was watching. You know it's bad when you haven't watched it in a year and yet you still know all the words and exactly how to time them so they fit the characters mouths as there talking. I also watched All Dogs Go to Heaven, which is a totally awsome movie. ^_^ .... At least we got to play gameboy during the boring movies. Out of the people who had a gameboy, which was like 3 or 4 kids, I think everyone was playing pokemon. We're all so lame lol.</P>
<P>Man, my dad is so out of it, he had a tooth removed and he's been choking down pain killers like they're jelly beans. Better than yesterday though, he was drinking Captain Morgan's and eating his 'magic' jelly beans. So he was drunk and high. Weirdo.</P>
<P>Wellbies... hmmm... Idunno? Anything I want to write I was told not to tell anyone about. Dammit. Josh had a Slip Knot shirt on today, lucky bastard. =P</P>
<P>Well, I'm out. Ja ne!</P>

"event","<P>Only 3 more days of school. Hoorah! Thank god, I'm getting so bored of school.</P>
<P>Today was ok, a half day at school. Nothing much interesting happened, I tried to nap laying on Josh's lap on the floor during a movie in 2nd hour, finished up my art projects on 3rd hour and had a pretty non-party party in 4th hour. There was pizza though, and pop, and chips... though&nbsp;I had nothing, besides a few sips of Stevo's Coke.</P>
<P>Came home and got my brother from school, which was nuts, it was so hot outside, plus I was wearing all black, fishnets and my dragon jacket thing. I almost died I sware. But I got to see my old teacher, Mrs. Briegel, who was dissapointed in my choice of earrings. (I had my claws in lol) I also saw my 1st grade teacher Mrs. Dorais, who is most definitly kick ass.</P>
<P>Eh, what else... I can't get ahold of Danny, who was supposed to come home with me one of these half days. Oh well I suppose. She'd only cause trouble over here anyways. =P She's cool though.</P>
<P>Well, I guess I'm gonna go. Gotta brush Zena, make a rolled sammich and watch some Iny. Ja.</P>

<P>So, I was supposed to hang with Danny today, but her dad's a bitch so we can't. She couldn't even ask, he just swore and her and told her to get off the fucking phone. When she asked why, he went a long rant that I even couldn't keep up with because fuck must have been between each word he said. Then she said ok and told me she had to go, and he went on and on still. ""Ok? No, it's not ok, it's not ok at all!"" Wtf you bastard? She was getting off the phone, why still badger her? God I hate him. I'm not fond of either of her parents&nbsp;but he really just doesn't give a damn about anything. Dammit. &gt;_&lt;</P>

<P>Yeah anyways, I guess I don't have much to write, or much that I really want to write. School is the same, dumped my boyfriend and had another guy and one of my gal pals ask me out. Weirdos. Plus Ken WILL NOT get off me, he thinks it's still ok to hug all the time but noooo! I don't like hugs from x-bfs lol. Oh well.</P>
<P>Oh, and I got a hand full of sugar thrown at me in science yesterday, after our little corner of girls was attacked with hornets by Joe and his crew. Oh, and josh was throwing stuff at the ceiling trying to get it to stick. Felicia was the one with the sugar, she had a whole bag of it. Most of it is on the floor in the science room. =P Danny poked me like all hour literally, I don't usually mind but then again it was for like an hour straight and I was trying to actually get some work done lol. Amy is always yelling at us because she says we're flirting. Whatever.</P>

<P>I cut myself?!</P>
<P>No no... just joking... *coughs slightly under breath* what I actually did was spend the night, Saturday night, at my mother's house. Crazy perhaps, but it actually wasn't half bad. I mean, I found my GB! Yay! ^_^ Yeah anyways... so it was ok, walked a mile to Target and GameStop for the hell of it, then had to carry my brother home. =P He's such a lame ass. Oh well.</P>
<P>I was supposed to go skating with Josh and Stevo on Saturday but obviously I ended up at mom's. So no go. Danny was supposed to spend the night Friday... or was I supposed to go over there... Idunno but either way I went and saw Shrek 2, which was so totally awsome. Would love to go see it again. But won't obviously. </P>
<P>One thing that is pissing me off though really bad is Danny's family situation. Her family, mother and father, are the worst parents I know, or at least gave me that impression. They constanly swear at her and tell her she can do whatever she wants as long as she doesn't bother them. I feel bad for her, and it pisses me off. She's a good girl and her parents have no reason to treat her like that. Dammit</P>
<P>Well, I really have nothing much to write in here. Oh, besides that, Danny, I didn't get grounded this weekend for what we were saying Laura was most definitly going to tell my parents. She didn't say a word. Thank god. Wait... you don't read this journal lol. Nevermind.</P>

"event","<P>K. So. My weekend was good, until today, of course. =P Explain I shall. </P>
<P>Yesterday, I went to Bonaventure with Danny and Amy. I'm really getting sick of going with Amy because she wants to be center of attention 100% of the time. But anyways, it was a lot of fun, though I think we probably did more of everthing else besides skating. ^_^ I skated the most, so yay for me! =P So yeah, we flirted with this guy named Jordan, who is 16, and was guessing our ages and guessed Danny to be 14 and then Amy to be 17. WTF?! Amy is the shortest of us all lol, and she doesn't exactly look all that old. But whatever, he never guessed my age, but I was too busy begging a guy Danny nicknamed 'Squeeky' for his phone # because Dan thought he was hot. ^_~ What else... we dirty danced on the mushroom chairs... moreover tried too, Danny wouldn't shut up and stop telling us we were doing everything wrong. (Danny's style is way dif from mine and Amy's). Didn't end up dancing that much, between Jordan, Adam, Squeeky and Harry lol. =P And Ed wasn't there, I was so dissapointed.</P>
<P>Danny spent the night also, which was actually really fun, though she made me stay up until 3 am and then get up at 8:30. She was scarying me at first, when we were at Bonni she's all like ""Tonight, I'm wearing a thong, and I've got a V-neck night shirt... and I'm going to Lyssy's!"" I was like whoa, what is she planning? Nothing surprisingly. lol. Unless you count boob poking... then again it isn't uncommon between me and her... lol. She did tell me to turn the lights off when I was trying to get my stuffed doggy back from her. ?_? She just wanted to fight around in the dark lol. =P It was weird though, she brought a plastic bag of like all the notes I've written her. Why so weird... probably because Ken does almost the same thing. Weird weird lol. First time I've slept in the same bed during a sleep over in a very long time too. Didn't feel weird though. Wonder why... lol.</P>
<P>Ok, sorry, gotta break, IT'S FREEZING IN HERE! #_# I'm gonna die!</P>
<P>So yeah, that rocked. But I was dead tired all day today. Oh well. Laura's was ok, I almost started crying but it was ok. She was a little more loose this time. I'm in trouble though, next week when she talks to my dad. I'm fucked.</P>
<P>Then, I had a band concert to play, which was ok. Didn't get to play Pink Panther though. =( A ton of people didn't show up... so that wasn't cool...</P>
<P>Then, the worst part, I had to go look for a wedding dress. Er... one to wear to a wedding. I told my dad to just pick something, I wasn't going to like anything anyways, and I'll admit it, I was being a stubborn bitch the whole time we were out. For that part anyways. It sucked, he wanted me to wear a shirt or a dress, and NO BLACK! I almost choked lol.</P>
<P>Finally, he broke and said I could wear casual pants, but still no black. We shopped for a while, and went in the 3 most terrible stores in the world: Gap, Express and Forever 21. Let me stress my hatred for Forever 21. =P (sorry Sarah, I think you shop there? Idunno). It was a depressing trip, when you're a fat ass shopping in the skinny girl stores. =P It got ok later though.</P>
<P>So, I said fuck it, I'll just wear whatever skirt I had tried on at Gap and find some blouse thing to go with it. So, in some store... I forget what it was, Lord and Taylor or something... (fucking Twelve Oaks preppy ass mall) there was a casual black button up thingy, and to my surprise my dad said it was ok. So I tried it on, with a pair of uhm Idunno cackey (spelling) pants or something, and I walked out of the dressing room to show my dad and he like made a yelp thing and covered his eyes. Upon inquiring as to what was so terrible, he un-covers his face and says ""Where did those come from?!"" He then looked down to my chest lol. Which is silly because I'm not that big, but from what he told me my XXL t-shirts are decieving. *shrugs* I think he's just weird, but untrue or not it was uplifting. XD That was the outfit I ended up with too lol.</P>
<P>One good thing about Twelve Oaks -- The Hot Topic. I have been searching out a pair of earings for a while, and I was about to have KK order them off the net for me, and the 12 oaks HT had them! YAY! I couldn't look through the store though, my dad hates that store and hates being in it. Oh well, I got my earings. I win!</P>
<P>Well, I'm out so love ya guys bye!</P>

<P>So, yeah, I went to Laura's today. It was better that usual, I guess, she didn't yell at me so that was pretty cool. She still doesn't really think I'm getting better, she makes it seem like I have all of these problems. I don't know what they are, and she won't tell me either. She says I need to understand, except and know who I am. Whatever that means.</P>
<P>So yeah, that was fun. She also told me that the reason I'm in counceling wasn't so I would stop cutting, which my first thought was then it was ok for me to, which obviously it's not but I'm an idiot anyway you look at it. I don't know what she's trying to get out of me, there's always something but she never really tells me what she wants to know. God, she's so confusing, makes me think to much. &gt;_&lt; And my Hello Kitty journal I got from Hot Topic back in the day, when I was ye high over yonder, (inside joke) has now become a journal strictly for Laura to read. That's just great lol. Man I'm so sick of the world. I need a fuzzy corner of space to curl up in and dissapear... yeah... ok I'm dead I'm going to go write byez.</P>

"event","<P>Went to Bonni tonight. I thought it was going to be awsome, it ended up being me, Danny, Serina, Ben and Amy. It started good but way too much shit happened. I don't even want to get into it tonight, maybe some other time but I'm so pissed off right now. Mainly at Serina, but erg nevermind. I told Danny I might take her up there again - just me and her or something - but I will NEVER go with all of them again. Way too much shit.</P>
<P>So that was the story of tonight, even though I haven't really told it. Tomorrow, I'm going to Laura's at like noon or something, which sucks because god damn I'm so sick of her. I'm so sick of social workers or councelors or whatever in general. I wish life was normal again.</P>
<P>Then, I get to spend the rest of the day (I get 2 hours inbetween Laura and this) babysitting with my dad. Wonderful, I must remind you all how much I adore my father. Really, I'm starting to hate him. He doesn't listen to anything I say, or at least doesn't take anything seriously, he's always gone at night with Julie and if he's not then she's over all night and perhaps the next morning, he hardly gives me any privacy at all I'm lucky there's a shower curtain because if there wasn't I'd be fucked because he has no problem being around while I'm in the shower, no matter how much I protest. We don't have a normal bathroom, it's weird and it's a different situation but I don't give a fuck, I should be able to take a shower without knowing my dad is right outside the damn curtain. So anyways, he's just really getting to me lately. I wish I could be like put up for adoption or something. That would be cool, I think. Idunno.</P>
<P>Well I was going to write more but I'm dead. See ya guys later,</P>

"event","<P>Ok, so it's too damn early to post a journal entry but I have nothing else to do... besides like um get ready for school or something stupid like that.</P>
<P>So, got back from Chicago yesterday morning around 1:30 am, was tired as hell, yet still got on aim upon returning home. =P It was fun, went to the zoo, Gameworks, Midevil Times (awsome), the mall and of course, the main part of the trip, Phantom of the Opera. The Opera thing was boring, lemme tell ya. ^_~</P>
<P>So that was it. Serina and Sarah fought over Sarah's beanie that she sleeps in... Will, Serina and Sarah all sat in one row of seats on the bus... (I'm not sure how that was arranged lol) Will ended up buying dinner for Serina and Sarah... Amy got sick... I ended up sitting with some girl named Katy for the majority of everything... um someone almost had an asthma attack... lol ok that's enough. Oh no wait and we watched Ice Age on the way home. ^_^ Love that movie lol.</P>
<P>So, that was the trip, now it's back to school unfortunatly... though I get to see Ken at least. And Danny too. =P See ya'll later.</P>

"event","Ah yes, so today began like the normal 'don't get up til past noon and then lay around' day. But it was cool. After getting up at 2, my dad inquires as to why I haven't already asked to go to Ken's, which makes me call him lol. I end up at his house for about half of the day, and then, to my surprise, his parents let him go to Bonni with me. Which was a relief, I figured I'd end up going with Amy again. =P Anyways, it was fun, he fell like 7 times... smart thing to do with a cast on ne? Lol, and I can out skate him! Woo! He dies on corners... doesn't know how to do cross-overs... lol. That's where you get most of your speed at a small place like Bonni lol. Duh!
So anways, that was pretty fun. He was not like totally into it but I still had fun. ^_^ His problem is... he thinks dates or hanging out are for making out lol. Don't get me wrong, I like making out, but there is more to a relationship than that. I mean, if his mom isn't there the whole time we're at his g-ma's we sit in his basement and makeout lol. Ya'd think he'd wanna do something else once in a while. ^_~
The best part at Bonni was probably Ed. He's awsome. During the speed skate (race) he runs out in his shoes and races the people on their skates. Then he jumps up on the half wall and yells lol. He's awsome, he also requested Machlik Gay (I think that's what it's called, if I'm wrong sorry don't kill me) by Tatu, which I am really not a fan of, and to hear it at a skating rink is just too bizaar. Anyone who has heard the song knows what I'm talking about.
It was also like Evanescence night, they played Haunted, Bring me to Life, and Everybody's Fool twice. Which is awsome, I love Evanescence. *Little voice in my head* ""But no one else does so shut up""* Manda does! *hugs* Love you sexy! Now if only they would play somemore Disturbed and System of a Down... lol.
But anyways, gotta say it again, Ed was awsome. At one point some girl was like yelling at him and walked off looking concerned with her cell phone, and he throws his hands in the air and in a really weird like dramatic voice goes ""Why do all of your friends have to be suicidal?!"" He's cool, if anyone wants to meet him or something come to Bonni with me on Saturday night... he's always there... 
Well, that's all for now, I'm beat. Not skating for almost a whole month makes a difference lol. Plus I've got a hella lot of Grammar work to make up... and I should work on Yume a little bit...

"event","<P>Today sucked something bad lol. Well, I take that back. From about 4:00 pm and after it was fairly well. But before then sucked. Let me give you the details that you probably don't care about.</P>
<P>So, I have to go to Laura's at 12:15. My mom was a no show up until it was almost time to go in, but Laura was 20 minutes late so it shortened our time to talk by about a half hour... meaning a half hour had to be split between me, my mom and dad. That sucked.</P>
<P>Laura is being quite the bitch, I don't know what's going on but suddenly she's convinced that everything I am telling her is a lie. And now that I think I am a lot better off that what I have been since November, she is convinced that I'm more fucked up than ever. I don't get it. I guess maybe I'm not supposed to... Idunno, but I have no clue how concelling is going to help anything when my psyche doesn't even believe me. This sucks, and now I have to see her once a week instead of once every other week. I'm lost.</P>
<P>So, then my mom asks me if I'm going to her house, and&nbsp;I tell her no, I'm going to Ken's after school and I don't want to come to her house after that either. Then she says there are other methods to get me there and that she'll see me later tonight. I'm personally not a fan of threats but I let this slide. She won't be able to do anything, I'll be at Ken's when she comes to get Bruiser anyways.</P>
<P>I was, but she was set on taking me. After dad told her that I was not to leave the house (even though I wasn't there anyways) she asked to take me out for an hour and talk to me, which he also declined to, being that I was at Ken's and there was no way in hell I was going anywhere with her. She left after arguing, or so I'm told, though obviously I'm just going off what dad says. When he came and got me from Ken's we went to Julie's house, and on the way there the police called.</P>
<P>Mom had apparently believed that the cops would remove me from my father's house and escort me to hers. Wrong! ^_^ My dad had a simple convorsation with the officer and it was over, nothing happened and we went happily to Julie's. lol.</P>
<P>Later, I chatted with Kevo and Sarah about oral sex lol. How fun.</P>
<P>Anyways, I have lots of homework I should be doing so I must be off. Oyasumi-nasai.</P>

I think it's supposed to be frosting but Idunno it doesn't taste like it and it's so good! ^_^ And I'm so totally out of it! v_v And I dun have a ride to Koyama Shoten or WizzyWigs! 0_0 I'm gonna die lol. </P>
<P>Sooo, everyone has been asking me if I'm ok. I'M FINE! Gosh lol. I don't mind ya'll asking but what is it that I'm doing that's making you kiddies wonder? ?_? Oh wellz. Eep, so tomorrow I'm heading off to Laura's again, sadly, and my mom is coming. 0_0 It is gonna be erg... I dun even want to think about it. I've got the icky scared feeling already... so sleep probably won't be a big thing tonight. Sucks so bad, I'm worried about so much. What if&nbsp;she doesn't let me go back to school? I mean... is there really a point in being out of school this long? It's not like I'm getting any help or something. What if dad finds out I'm bi? Well... more about everything with Sarah? I don't even know how he would respond... I don't want to think about it. What if she puts me on meds? Erg that would really suck. I don't know what mom is going to do either. I bet she'll fuck everything up. She's really good at that. God I ha--... really dislike her. </P>
<P>So that's tomorrow's fears. Damn, I don't get it. Laura has been being so mean lately... what the hell did I do? And she tells me I'm not getting better... wtf? She thinks I'll cut again for sure, honestly I don't. I haven't felt the need to in quite some time, and the scars are becoming embarressing. And it's bound to cause problems with Ken's parents at sometime, hell, Sarah's mom too. I don't want to anymore and I don't think I will, really this time for sure. And of course, now that I feel like this, this is the time when Laura just thinks I'm totally fucked up lol. What luck I have.</P>
<P>So anways, I guess I'm off. I have to create a private journal to dump my bottled up shit in for Laura. See ya'll around, and pray that she lets me back in school,</P>
<P>Love Always,</P>

"event","So...
I go to see Laura (my psychiatrist) on Tuesday, so that I may go back to school and not have much homework for the week. Feeling better than I had in a very long time, I felt confident that Laura would sign my papers and send me off to school. But no.
She made me feel like shit. She downed me on a lot of things, told me it doesn't look like I'm getting better in a lot of ways and the biggie, wouldn't let me return to school. When I first went in she called Ms. Merski (my school social worker) and they talked for a while, and Ms. Merski faxed Laura an e-mail that my mother had sent her. Due to things discussed by my mother and I over AIM while I was in Maryland, my mom decided to send an e-mail (which I haven't read) pretty much tattling on anything I said. THAT was the main reason I couldn't return to school... among other things, but that's just the basics.
So anyways, my days have been consisting of boring laying around, or shopping with my dad. Neither of which are very fun, but I did get to ride on my dad's motorcycle today. ^_^ It was fun, but it started raining on the way home lol. Not much fun. Then, we went to pick up the regular kids from school and I got to see Ken, Amy and KK. Well, those are the people I talked to, I saw a lot of other people too. KK gave me a couple hugs, Amy didn't say much and Ken gave me a few hugs too. Then, after returning home I went over to Ken's house, and stayed true to his father, we actually didn't kiss! 0_0 We just threw hot sauce packets at each other instead. ^_^ It was a lot of fun, I love him so much. ^_~
Anyways, my website template is almost finished, (hooray!) and my site should be up by Monday. We'll see lol, it's currently themed for my story, which is ok, but only because I couldn't think of anything else lol. I'll change it later some time.
And since when am I obsessed with Sarah? (sez Kevo) He's such a silly head lol.
love always,

"event","Let's see... let's start with Sarah and Kevo... who are a couple now! Yay! See I told her to go out with him a while ago and she just wouldn't listen. *smacks Sarah in the head* You dork.
What else... I'm still going out with Ken, which I'm starting to think is stupid since he's still in love with Sarah. He proved it the other day, so it's not just a suspsion anymore. That pisses me off so bad. I love him though... I don't want to dump him. But I mean is he thinking of Sarah and not me while I'm thinking of him?
Oh yeah, and I went skating with Sarah today, which I believe I already mentioned. It was tons of fun, got really sweaty though lol. We have been trying to go skating for like ever lol but something has always came up... this was the first skating trip since last September. I was glad we could go. ^_^
What else... um. Oh yeah! I scared the shit outta Kevo last night. Omfg it was so weird I liked totally spilled everything! Well almost everything... lol. It was so weird! But he's cool and says he won't mention it to anyone... though he was demanding my psychiatrists phone # at 1 in the morning. lol. It was one of those nights... I lost it again. Good thing there is always someone online to chill me out when that happens. If not it could be bad. Idunno.
I might be getting a lab puppy... Idunno for sure. It's a hard decision. =\ We'll see we'll see.
I have to get my psychiatric evaluation filled out on Thursday so I can go back to school. I'm scared that I'm going to get all ready to go and then she'll send me off to Havenwyck. That would suck so bad. I'm afraid she might put me on meds too... I'm just hoping she sends me to school as if nothing happened. I doubt it though. -_- Damn
Well I got somemore website making to do so I'm out. See ya guys later.

Wow I am really not happy with Ken. Idunno why, I haven't even talked to him in a while and I'm still a little irritated with him. How could I not be? Erg. Lolz
Man I'm so bored... I was working on my site a little bit and now there's a bunch of people over. I called Danny today, but she only pissed me off... she talks crazy lol. I think she just wants me to say that I care lol. I guess I do... Idunnoz. Well I'm not really in the mood to write so I guess I'll update later.

I feel kinda bad, because I'm not going to be living with my mommy anymore, but she doesn't know that, and she thinks everything is 100% fine. And I went to her house yesterday so I could get her blades and she gave me an easter basket with Japanese candy in it and a Kirara plushie. -_- I feel so guilty lol. Oh well! ^_~ I'm like using her she's taking me to lazer tag tomorrow and maybe out to Wizzy Wigs and then my dad is gonna pull full custody lol. 
Last night was bad. My mood like went from goofy to dead in 5 minutes lol. It was weird. >_< And I was talking crazy and Kevo got too much outta me. v_v Damn bastard lol. It was so weird, he asked me what I would do if Sarah died (don't ask what we were talking about lol) and I just started crying! It was so fucking crazy. Oh well, so I talked to him until like 2 in the morning until he finally got fed up with me. =P
Todayz I am FINALLY going skating again with Sarah, first time since last September. And that was weird so lol we won't talk about that. I'm happy though, I haven't seen her in 3 weeks! Well... I saw that picture of her in the pretty pink shirt... lol. She's so spiffy. ^_^

Oh yeah, Happy Easter! Happy easter... yeah. Hope ya'll did something fun. I spent mine sleeping, for I had nothing else to do since everyone else was busy. So nice. Oh well, it was a comfy couch... and Kindergarden cop was on... lol until Ken called. Then I talked to him for a while. Then I went back to sleep. Awsome.
A ton is going on, Amy is cutting, my boyfriend is still in love with my bestfriend, my mom's a bitch, my dad gets drunk almost every night, I'm eating M&Ms... lol. What's next? Oh I know, I'll fall in love with my bestfriend too! Or again... or yeah whatever lol.
Idunno if Amy is really cutting or not, she claims to be, but she likes to lie so who knows. I honestly don't really care. I would care, but if she's going to lie to me just so I worry about her no. I don't go online telling people I'm cutting and that I have a reason to but they don't. Ok, Ms. Merski will tell you I don't have a reason, but that's only because I told her Idunno lol. 
And then there's Ken. I thought that he was over Sarah, honestly I did, but I guess he's not. This upsets me, but there isn't shit I can do about it. I mean I guess I understand... I mean if I were like still in love with Sarah and he wasn't I wouldn't want him to be upset with me. But Idunno the way he told me it just made me look like her replacement and I don't like that. I don't like knowing that if Sarah ever asked him out that he'd drop me like I were nothing. I mean, I can't compare with Sarah at all, but it's still kind of upsetting. Oh well.
Oh yeah, and my mom's a bitch. She now is deciding she doesn't want me to go to my Aunt Janice's for 4th of July because it's her year, even though I go EVERY year no matter what. It's kind of a tradition, we've been going to her house since forever. She can kiss my ass, I'm going whether she likes it or not. =P We're arguing about it on AIM right now actually. Lol.
And I ate all my M&MS. Oh well.

Let's get ya guys up to speed. I'm Lyssy, I'm 13, I live in MI... well... at the moment I live in Maryland, but we'll get to that in a minute. Short, brown hair, blue eyes... yeah like you guys really care lol.
My main friends names are Sarah, Linds, Danny, Amy, and Kenny. They are cool, everyone lives up in MI except Linds, who currently lives in Florida, but will be returning this summer. Danny, Amy and I cut ourselves, though Danny only cuts herself because I do, damn little copy kitty. ^_^ Sarah is probably the most sane person out of us, yet at the same time the craziest. Like this summer, I have to fill my basement with ice cream because she's coming over... lol long story.
Kenny is my boyfriend, which is really odd, because for Idunno even how long he was drooling over Sarah. It was BAD, this kid couldn't let her go, and she hated... no wait hates his guts. So how did I get with him? Well, he started writing me notes after he found out I loved Sarah (yes, I'm bi, no, I will not explain because it's an even longer story than the basement full of ice cream one. ^_~) and I guess was looking for someone to confide in? Idunno it was really weird but anyways then he decides he liked me so we are going out lol. I was really scared at first though because I felt like Sarah's replacement but I don't think that's how he thinks of it... then again I don't really know... lol.
But anyways, that's my main buddies, I have more but those are like the main ones. I think I made all of us sound like a group... we're not a group lol. Danny, Sarah and Amy all hate Kenny, Amy hates Danny, Sarah doesn't like Amy, blah blah it's so complicated lol.
So those are my buds up in MI (and down in Florida =P)but I also have some online friends! Eric, the awsome sexy gay guy my mom worked with until he moved to Cali (damn lucky bastard). Manda, the sexy... um... yeah her and Jez lol. Oh and Jonathan, the sexy guy from the Netherlands! WOO! Lol... and crooked Chris... nevermind.
So why am I not in MI? Well, for the 2nd time, I was kicked out of school for cutting. The first time, I was evaluated for Havenwyck, but was not accepted, however if I were to cut again the guy said he'd take me. Well, guess what, I did it again! However, my dad is having my regular psychiatrist fill out my evaluation form, since supposedly she doesn't believe in places like Havenwyck. But, when I got kicked outta school (a week and a few dayz ago) my psyche was on vaca lol. And, my dad had to go to Maryland for like 3 weeks or something to do a job for my Uncle. I couldn't stay with my mom for 3 weeks (complete bitch, lemme tell ya) so my dad had to take me with him! So now, I'm stuck in Maryland until he's done working! lol. And let me tell ya, compared to MI, people here are much more friendly, but it's like the boonies out here lol. It sucks, but everyone is loaded with cash and has a really suped up computer. $_$ The houses are like whoa! 0_0 Wish I had this kind of cash lol.
So, today, I'm going to rollerblade all afternoon... though I don't know where to. Lately I've just been sitting on the computer all day writing or playing games or something. Or watching The Hot Chick, god that movie rocked. ^_^ So anyways, I'll write an entry at the end of the day! ttfn lol

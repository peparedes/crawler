To be lost in the forrest to be cut adrift
You've been trying to reach me you bought me a book
To be lost in the forrest to be cut adrift
I've been paid...I've been paid

Don't get offended if i seem absent minded just keep telling me facts
and keep making me smile
Don't get offended if i seem absent minded...I get tongue tied
Baby you've got to be more discerning...I've never known whats good for me
I will be yours...
I'll pay for you...anytime

You told me you wanted to eat up my sadness...well jump on enjoy, you can gorge away
You told me you wanted to eat up my sadness...jump right on
Baby you've got to be more discerning...I've never known what's good for me and
Baby you've got to be more demanding...I will be yours

What are you holding out for..what's always in the way
Why so damn...absent minded...why so scared...of romance

This modern love ... breaks me
This modern love... wastes me

Do you wanna come over and kill some time
(tell me facts tell me facts tell me facts)
do you wanna come over and kill some time
do you wanna come over and kill some time

throw you're arms around...

me."

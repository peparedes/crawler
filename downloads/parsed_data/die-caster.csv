<lj-cut text=""Letter to Nobody"">Dear...

Dear whoever. I'm not writing this to anybody in particular. I guess I'm writing this more for myself. Because even after a month, I haven't been able to sort out the anger or the pain. All this time I thought I was better than the ilk of Marik or Bakura, that I was above their level... now I'm beginning to realize that it's not a matter of being above or below a personal level. It's simply a matter of how one feels at any given time, and how one responds to one's environment around them.

You know what? I have no idea what the hell I'm talking about. That's okay, though. I'm only writing this for myself.

Sorting things out.

Yeah, right.

So, Atemu and Yuugi's 5-month anniversary rolled along. I guess that's where the entire thing begins. Or maybe it doesn't, maybe it begins when I thought I had even the ghost of a chance with Shizuka after coming back from a long stay in Tokyo. Whatever. It all came to a head on that particular holiday for the happy couple. I had briefly stopped by the Game Shop to wish Yuugi and Atemu a happy anniversary. I'd thought about offering them a gift of some sort, then realized that with all the stock Yuugi has in Industrial Illusions, he could probably buy Madagascar and have enough left over for a few hundred thousand Xboxes. Besides, it's the thought that counts, not the gifts themselves. And what better gift is there than the wonderful companionship of somebody who loves you for you?

I thought there was no answer for that question. Guess I was wrong.

Anyway, like I said, I went to the Game Shop and wished Yuugi a happy anniversary after school that day. Of course he was appreciative. When I asked him where Atemu was so I could pass along my good wishes to him, Yuugi said that he'd gone over to visit with Shizuka for a while. That reminded me that it'd been a while since I'd checked in on Shizuka, and for all I knew, she'd appreciate a visit from me. If not that, then certainly some lilies might cheer her up.

Off to the flower shop with me, and I picked up a bushel of lilies. That was my frivolous expense for the day, a bushel of lilies. The Tokyo store was still getting off the ground with business. I wasn't in any particular hurry, and I wanted to give Atemu plenty of time to leave before I dropped by - I sort of wanted to spend some time alone with Shizuka to talk about what happened during our last trip to Tokyo - so I decided to walk over. Several blocks' distance, and there I was, walking down the sidewalk with a bushel of lilies in my arms and my heart beating with all the force of a machine gun.

I arrived at Shizuka's apartment, and was just about to ring the doorbell when I picked up the faint sound of moaning. And this wasn't the kind of moaning one makes when in pain. Oh, no. This was the kind of moaning one does when one is having an intense physical sensation that bears very little relation to pain... and direct relation to pleasure.

The blinds had been drawn over the nearby window. I wouldn't have dared to look anyway, because I was sure Marik was the one indulging Shizuka. Actually, I was more certain that Marik was doing it purely to indulge himself. But whatever the motivation, I was positive that Marik was inside (in more ways than one) and my timing couldn't have been worse. Surely the sight of them in that particular act would have done little for my mental health - which, after all I've been through, is unstable at best.

I considered leaving the lilies outside her door instead, but there was a 50/50 chance that she was going to be the one to step outside next. This was a dilemma, as I was fairly certain Marik would simply stuff them in a garbage can - or worse, deliver them to her himself and claim them as <i>his</i> gift!

As I was trying to resolve this problem, I heard voices inside... and the male voice wasn't Marik's. No. I knew this voice, and it definitely wasn't Marik's.

That was when it occurred to me to look at the parking lot behind the apartment complex.

And sure enough, sitting in a visitor's slot, was Atemu's car.

The voices stopped, and the noises of pleasure got louder.

I couldn't... I just couldn't... I didn't...

This is so hard to write down. I mean, you try to say it out loud and that's a tough enough battle, because you're saying it all on the fly. There's no script when you're saying it out loud. When you try to write it down, you can afford to spend a lot of time trying to come up with a sufficient verbal definition of what's on your mind. But I've got nothing.

Suffice it to say, once I realized it wasn't Marik in there, I had to suppress a series of extremely violent urges, all of which would have scared them worse than anything Marik could have done, and all of which would probably have landed me in jail or Hell.

Because when it comes right down to it... they're people, too. And the decisions they make are their own. They may not be the right decisions, but they're theirs. And where do I get off looking down my nose at them for being just as human as I am? I've been trying to encourage Shizuka for months to give Marik the boot from her life entirely... and I'll admit, part of it was because I wanted her for myself. But she doesn't belong to me. And to go charging in there all self-righteous would only prove that in the end, I'd be as awful a companion as Marik.

So while I don't approve, and don't understand, why they did what they did... I really have no choice but to accept it. And along with that, I think it's about time I accepted that I have no chance with her. I need to move on.

I made that realization in a half-instant. So I turned away from the door, away from the complex... away from them. And I walked back out into the street, and put the lilies in the nearest sewer. I went back to the school and my store, made arrangements for me to be gone indefinitely. I left for Tokyo that evening, and told no one.

I never looked back. I don't regret it.

I wonder if they can say the same.

--
</lj-cut>

After writing the letter, I folded it up and stuck it in my pocket. I wasn't entirely sure what to do with it. I'd written out what I needed to write out... that should have done the trick.

I had some business to clear up with the Kame Game Shop, so I dropped by there during school hours. Fortunately, it was Yuugi's jiichan behind the counter and not his husband. I don't know that I could have looked the Pharaoh in the eye, knowing what I know. Sugoroku-san, of course, admonished me for skipping, but I explained the situation to him and he lightened up a little.

I was suddenly struck by an urge to offer him the letter, to pass on to Atemu. I have no idea what good that would have done... probably none, now that I think on it. Still, I couldn't help but continue to finger the letter in my pocket as I spoke with Sugoroku-san.

When our business was finished, as well as most of our small talk, I turned away and started to head for the door. There was a trash can sitting nearby, and it caught my eye just as I was about to head out.

I considered it, then took the letter out of my pocket and examined it one more time.

I crumpled the paper in my hand, and threw it away.

Of all the things in life to remember, this is the least of those I want.

Back from the trip with Shizuka, of course. We got held over an extra day because I felt a little under the weather. Shizuka was very kind to me during that time. I couldn't have asked for a better road-tripping companion.

"event","<lj-cut text=""My duel against Varon..."">Otogi took his position on one side of the arena, and when he saw his opponent, he resisted the urge to gulp.

<i>Varon.</i>

He supposed he should have expected it. Varon had been going up through the ranks with his favorite Armor cards, frustrating the hell out of his opponents... most notably ""Insector"" Haga, who had been thoroughly squished. Varon's Life Points had only dropped twice, and one of those times was of his own doing.

Otogi could not say he was looking forward to this match.

Varon, for his part, stepped up and smiled confidently as he shuffled his deck. ""G'day, mate,"" he drawled. ""Nice to see you again. Under better circumstances, I might add. Nice setup you got here. I'm duly impressed.""

<i>I'm not going to be intimidated. I'm not.</i> Otogi likewise shuffled his deck, and did so several times while regarding Varon with a measured gaze. ""To be honest, I was hoping Haga would take you out of the competition.""

Varon snorted. ""Please. The boy can't even tie his shoes, let alone duel me to a standstill. Was nothing at all to beat him. As I recall, it didn't take much to beat you, either.""

""Oh, give me another chance, I beg you,"" Otogi mocked. ""I'm ready for you this time around.""

""I wouldn't have it any other way,"" Varon replied, and he stuck his deck in his duel disk. ""So let's get started, you won the coin toss.""

Otogi drew his opening hand, already aware that Varon wasn't interested in wagering cards. <i>I have the advantage of knowing most of his monsters, if not all of them, have an attack power of 0. So I can start off with something relatively weak and work my way up.</i> ""Okay, let's go with Roulette Barrel (1000/2000) in attack mode. Then I place one card face-down. Your turn.""

Varon drew, and smirked. ""Right, then. I summon Advanced Shield (1000/0) in attack mode."" A large hexagonal shield appeared in front of Varon; apparently this monster wasn't going to attach to him. ""Then I put two cards face-down, and it's back to you.""

""Hm."" Otogi pulled the next card off the top of his deck. <i>I wonder if this monster has any effects I don't know about. But better safe than sorry...</i> ""I activate my Roulette Barrel's special effect. It lets me roll a die twice, and then I get to select one of the results and destroy all monsters on the field with the same number of Level stars as the number I choose.""

""Guess you're shooting for a 4, then?"" Varon questioned. ""Seeing as my Advanced Shield has that level... but so does your Roulette Barrel.""

""Which is exactly why I haven't summoned anything yet this turn,"" Otogi remarked, as a large die appeared between them and rolled around the arena. The first result was a 3, and the second a 2.

Varon smirked. ""Looks like you're fresh out of luck, mate.""

<i>Nuts. I guess I'll take the direct approach, then.</i> ""Maybe not. I summon Strike Ninja (1700/1200) in attack mode."" Otogi's favored Ninja monster appeared on his field, looking out of place next to his Roulette Barrel. ""Strike Ninja, attack his Advanced Shield!""

Strike Ninja hurled a series of throwing knives at Varon's monster, and they embedded themselves in the shield before exploding in an orange haze. Varon watched with a measured expression of interest as his Life Points scrolled down to 3300.

""Activate trap!"" Varon announced. ""Attack and Receive! It lets me deal 700 damage to your Life Points.""

Otogi blinked as his Life Points dropped to 3300, as well. <i>Now our Life Points are even and he has nothing on his field. That was easy.</i> ""Now, Roulette Barrel, attack his Life Points directly!""

A large rocket mounted on Roulette Barrel's top fired itself at Varon and exploded centimeters from him; he raised an arm instinctively to shield himself from the explosion, although it bore no real force to it. His Life Points dropped again, this time to 2300.

Otogi frowned. <i>Did he get a bad opening hand this time around? ... Or a really good one the first time we played?</i> ""That ends my turn.""

Varon chuckled to himself as he drew his next card. <i>Now the real fun begins.</i> ""All right, mate, let's kick it up a little. Buster Pile (0/0) in attack mode!"" The by-now familiar Armor monster appeared in front of Varon and then mounted itself on his right arm. ""And this fun little number allows me to automatically destroy any monster I attack and deal 500 points of damage to your Life Points right on the spot. Like so...""

He ran across the arena, thrusting his right fist into Strike Ninja's abdomen. The hologram blew into a billion shards and vanished, leaving Otogi with one less monster and 2800 Life Points remaining.

He returned to his side of the field, grinning all the while. ""Then I'll place one card face-down and end my turn."" <i>Gimme your best shot.</i>

Otogi drew and kept his eye on Varon as he made his move. ""I activate Roulette Barrel's effect again. Maybe this time I'll have a little more luck.""

varon yawned unconcernedly while the die rolled around the field again. ""And here I thought Jounouchi was the only one who had to rely on luck to win his duels. Takin' a page out of his book, are we?""

The two results were 5 and 3, causing Otogi to grind his teeth. <i>That's the second time I've missed his monster's level.</i> ""Not really, I just like a good game of chance. Next I summon Witch of the Black Forest (1100/1200) in attack mode."" A black-clad spellcaster appeared where Strike Ninja had vanished the previous turn. ""Roulette Barrel, attack his Buster Pile!""

""Activate trap - Magnet Armor!"" Varon responded, and his previously departed Advanced Shield appeared on the field once again by the effect of his card. ""And I'll boost it with another trap - a little number called Rare Metalmorph, which increases its attack by 500. Sorry, mate, but now that I've got two Armor monsters on my field, I can redirect your attack.""

Otogi groaned as his Roulette Barrel's rocket attack rebounded and caused his own monster to blow up instead of the shield. His Life Points sank to 2300, once again even with Varon's. <i>And I can't attack with Witch, since she's weaker, too.</i> ""Fine, then, I end my turn.""

""Aww, don't feel bad."" Varon chuckled. ""Magnet Armor's effect only lasts until the end of the turn, so that leaves me with just my trusty Buster Pile."" He drew. ""But not for long. I summon Overbooster (0/500) in attack mode!"" As with his Buster Pile, his Overbooster monster appeared on the field for a moment, then clamped around his legs and waist, leaving only his torso, head, and left arm unprotected.

""Next, I place one card face-down, and then I get to do the fun part again."" He ran across the field again and pounded his armored right fist into Witch of the Black Forest. She, like Strike Ninja, offered no resistance to the attack and vanished on the spot, causing Otogi's Life Points to drop to 1800.

""My Witch's effect activates when she's sent to the graveyard,"" Otogi remarked, ""allowing me to draw Goblin Elite Attack Force from my deck.""

""Doesn't matter what you draw, it won't be around long,"" Varon responded. ""Nor, for that matter, will your Life Points. My turn's done.""

""We'll see how my Life Points are doing in short order,"" Otogi answered. ""First, I play Monster Reborn to bring back my Witch in defense mode. Then I summon Goblin Elite Attack Force (2200/1500) in attack mode.""

A row of green-skinned goblins wearing surprisingly well-kept armor and bearing swords appeared next to Otogi's defending Witch and set themselves, ready to strike.

""Goblin Elite Attack Force, attack his Buster Pile!""

""Your attack gets redirected to my Overbooster!"" Varon shot back. ""And in order to spare my Life Points a loss more humiliating than I care to take, I activate the trap card Energy Drain, which lets me increase the attack power of my Overbooster by 600 points this turn!""

The collective swords of Otogi's goblins lanced Varon's leg armor and easily rent it to scrap metal. Varon's Life Points plummeted to 700. <i>Hm. I have to admit I'm a bit impressed by this guy, he's taking it to me this time around.</i>

""Because they attacked, my Goblins have to go to defense mode for the next two turns. Hopefully it won't take that long to finish this up. I place one card face-down. Your move.""

Varon drew and grinned. ""All right. I summon Trap Buster (0/0) in attack mode."" This monster equipped itself to Varon's left arm. ""Its special effect stops all trap effects that would destroy my Armor monsters. And now for this."" He raced to Otogi's side of the field, looked Witch up and down, and grinned. ""Hello, love. And goodbye once again!""

His Buster Pile fist sent her back to the graveyard in an instant. He smirked as he returned to his side of the arena. ""Boy, I'll tell you, this sure gives me a good workout. Making you lose Life Points is just a bonus.""

""Then you'll have to live without that bonus this turn.""

Varon turned. ""What?""

Otogi grinned back at Varon as he pointed to the trap card he'd activated. ""Pikeru's Circle of Enchantment prevents me from taking any damage to my Life Points that involves card effects this turn. So it looks like my Life Points stay right where they are. And in the meantime, because Witch was destroyed again, I get to draw my Vampire Lord.""

Varon gave an irritated sigh. ""You can draw all the monsters you like, won't do you any good if I keep destroying 'em one by one. Next, I play the magic card Magnet Reversal, which lets me resummon my Overbooster from the Graveyard in defense mode."" Varon's legs once again became encased in armor. ""I end my turn.""

<i>He's got a point. I need something good to come my way.</i> He drew. <i>Maybe a couple of those cards I bought from the Pharaoh will come in handy.</i> ""I summon Getsu Fuhma (1700/1200) in attack mode.""

A female warrior dressed in traditional Japanese armor and bearing a pair of long katanas appeared on the field. ""Getsu Fuhma, attack... whicever one he says you're going to attack.""

""Overbooster, thank you,"" Varon snorted, and his legs were again assaulted by swords. This time, however, there were no Life Points to lose. ""You play it fast and mean with these ninjas.""

""What can I say? They're fun to use. I end my turn.""

Varon drew his next card and grinned. <i>This is gonna clinch it for me.</i> ""I switch my Trap Buster to defense mode, and activate the magic equip card Heart of Clear Water! Once equipped to a monster with less than 1300 attack points, it prevents that monster from being destroyed in battle or by any card effects that require a target. Of course, this card will go to my defending Trap Buster.""

His left arm, already bulked by the metallic holograms, increased in size as an impenetrable golden barrier surrounded it. Varon smirked. ""And of course, we can't forget the fun part about this game, now can we?""

This time, it was Otogi's Goblin Elite Attack Force that met Varon's fist. All of them cowered underneath the attack before disappearing in a haze. ""Cowards,"" Otogi muttered, as his Life Points dwindled to 1300.

""Eh? Didn't hear that.""

""You sure didn't.""

Varon harrumphed, an amused sound, and announced, ""That's it for now.""

Otogi considered his options. <i>If I keep putting monsters on the field, he's just going to keep destroying them. I can't perform an effective attack on him because he'll just redirect my attacks to his Trap Buster, and that can't be destroyed in battle now. All of his monsters right now have an attack of 0, so they couldn't do any damage to me in a direct attack. But I don't think I want to risk that.</i> ""Okay... I place one monster in defense mode and one card face-down. End turn.""

Varon chuckled. ""At this rate, you'll lose all your Life Points in the next three turns. I summon Active Guard (0/1000) in attack mode."" His Active Guard appeared on the field for a moment as a full breastplate, then mounted itself on his torso. He grinned at Otogi. ""This never gets old.""

Running across the field again, he put his fist through the holographic face-down monster card Otogi had set next to Getsu Fuhma. Varon laughed as Otogi's Spear Cretin (500/500) vanished without a peep. ""What, were you hoping I'd attack Getsu Fuhma instead? I'm savvy to plays like that, mate.""

""No doubt."" Otogi's Life Points had by now reached 800. ""On the other hand, I can activate the trap card I set last turn... Dust Tornado. Does your savvy make you familiar with it?""

A miniature twister reached out across the field and enveloped Varon's glowing left arm. Varon glared at the imagery. Yes, he was familiar with the card. It was allowing Otogi to destroy his Heart of Clear Water. <i>And then he can place one card face-down even during my turn. ...which, apparently, he chose to do.</i> ""Looks like you set that up pretty well. I was expecting a face-down surprise and I got one. End turn.""

Otogi drew his next card. <i>C'mon, deck, show me some love and give me a monster I can use...</i> The drawn card wasn't one Otogi normally thought was capable of much, but in this duel, he could have kissed it. ""All right, here we go. I summon Armed Ninja (300/300) in attack mode!""

The monster that appeared was a short, blue-garbed warrior that stood perhaps only as high as Getsu Fuhma's chest. Nevertheless, it was still stronger than any of Varon's monsters, and for that, Otogi was overjoyed. <i>I can finally do some damage again.</i> ""Getsu Fuhma, attack!""

""Your attack goes to my Trap Buster,"" Varon declared. Her twin swords hacked it off his arm instantly.

""And now, Armed Ninja, it's your turn - attack!""

""And this one will go to my Active Guard."" Armed Ninja's throwing stars exploded on contact with Varon's chest plate. His instinct was to cough at the smoke that curled up around his body, though he knew it wasn't real. Now he felt he had reason to be worried - his Life Points were at a perilous 400, half of Otogi's current Life Points. <i>This could go either way, really...</i>

""That ends my turn,"" Otogi announced.

Varon's next card raised his hopes somewhat. <i>At least I can stall a little.</i> ""I play Jet Gun Turret (0/1500) in attack mode!"" His new monster, a segment of armor bearing miniature rockets, mounted on his left arm. ""And now...""

He ran across again and struck Getsu Fuhma a sound blow, destroying her and sending Otogi's Life Points to 300. ""Your move,"" he said as he walked back to his side.

""And I'll make the most of it, too,"" Otogi responded. He'd seen Jet Gun Turret's special effect in previous duels. <i>If I attack it, he can just sacrifice it to destroy the attacking monster and no Life Point damage for either of us. But I have to stay on the offensive.</i> He looked at the card he'd played face-down at the beginning of the duel. <i>Good thing I've got one option still open to me.</i>

""I activate my Zombie's Jewel trap card!"" he announced, and he stepped over to meet Varon on his side of the arena. ""When this card's activated, I can take one magic card from your graveyard and use it as if it were my own. As payment for that effect, you get to draw one card.""

Varon frowned, but went along with the play and drew a card. He hadn't expected this. ""What magic card do I have in my graveyard that could possibly be of use to you?""

""Heart of Clear Water."" Otogi held out his hand expectantly.

At that moment, Varon understood Otogi's strategy. <i>Statistically, his Armed Ninja is so weak, it's hardly worth most people's notice... like my Armor monsters. And he's going to use that to his advantage in order to counter the effects my monsters have with my own card!</i>

He fumed inwardly, but there was little else he could do but remove the requested card from his graveyard and hand it to Otogi. Otogi smirked. ""Much obliged.""

He returned to his side of the arena and continued his play. ""Next, I equip Armed Ninja with Heart of Clear Water, so now your Buster Pile and Jet Gun Turret can't destroy it with their effects."" As he spoke, Armed Ninja became shrouded in the same golden glow that had bathed Varon's arm previously. ""Now, Armed Ninja, take it to him and attack!""

""Jet Gun Turret will take the hit,"" Varon answered, and so it did - Armed Ninja's aim was true and its throwing stars deadly. They exploded along the length of Varon's arm and sent Jet Gun Turret into oblivion... along with another 300 of Varon's Life Points, leaving him with only 100 still to his name.

""And that'll do it, for me,"" Otogi said. ""Your move.""

Varon drew another card, and smirked. ""All right, looks like you've had your fun. But this duel's come to a close. I play Psychic Armor Head (0/500) in attack mode."" The familiar helmet Armor monster landed atop Varon's messy hair. ""And now that my Psychic Armor Head is on the field, I can activate my Armor Gravitation magic card, allowing me to summon Big Bang Blow (0/0), Active Guard (0/1000), and Double Cloth Armor (0/0) from my deck in defense mode.""

<i>When he enters his Battle Phase, he'll use Big Bang Blow's effect to wipe out all monsters on the field and deal 300 damage to each of us... only he'll be safe by the effect of his Active Guard... unless...</i> He suddenly realized there was one piece missing to Varon's armor. <i>He doesn't have a Trap Buster on the field.

Big mistake.</i>

Hastily, Otogi activated his remaining face-down card. ""Activate Needle Ceiling!"" he declared. ""I can only activate it when there are at least four monsters on the field, and it allows me to destroy every single face-up monster, including my own... but more importantly, including all of yours!""

Over both duelists, a massive spiked ceiling appeared and crashed down upon them. Of course, both Otogi and Varon remained completely unharmed - the holograms passed right over them - but the Needle Ceiling impaled all of Varon's armor and Otogi's Armed Ninja, leaving both duelists with no monsters to defend themselves.

Varon snarled at this turn of events. <i>If only I had a second Trap Buster in my deck, I could have stopped that from happening!</i> As it was, he had nothing left to play. He heaved a sigh and said quietly, ""I end my turn.""

Otogi drew, then remarked, ""Looks like you're right, this duel <i>is</i> at its end. And it was a good one. I summon White Ninja (1500/800) in attack mode... and with no defenses on your field, White Ninja attacks your Life Points directly.""

Varon took the strike with his back straight, facing directly ahead. He wouldn't cower. It was a duel, nothing more - a game played between two opponents... one of them a little more worthy than he'd thought. His Life Points sank to zero at the resolution of the attack.

Otogi approached Varon and offered him a handshake, as well as his Heart of Clear Water back, both of which Varon accepted. ""Really. It was a good game,"" Otogi said.

Varon nodded. ""It was. Good luck with the next round."" That smug smirk came back to his face. ""Something tells me you're gonna need it...""</lj-cut>

I'm dueling Ryou next? ... This could be interesting."

I wonder if some of these people shouldn't have signed up for the Advanced bracket. Even in the Intermediate levels a couple of them might have put all the others to shame <s>including me</s>. I can only hope the competition is just as fast and fierce in the later levels, if not even more so.

Some of these kids have decks that look remarkably similar to each other, though... I think a few of them figured out why there are restrictions on certain cards and decided to build decks composed entirely of the restricted ones. That's fine for sales, of course - between the Kame Game Shop and Black Crown, there's been a veritable fortune turned - but for play it can get a little boring.

Intermediates? Tell me you have decks with a little more panache. And Advanceds, you have no excuse - you've got the actual ban list to deal with. *grin*"

Hey, Shizuka, looks like the two of us thought alike on what to trick each other with. Either that or you gave mine back to me.

"event","We've had a few more entrants into the intermediate and advanced levels of the tournament - including a couple even I didn't expect. Of course, the flood of kids coming in to fill up a new beginner level sheet every day still hasn't died down. There're as many as three dozen for that list alone, now.

We're gonna be busy that day.

For duelists who've yet to sign up and have been consistent contenders, I'm sending out invitations. Recipients include Isis Ishtar, Kujyaku Mai, Vivian Won, and Ryota Kajiki. Obviously, there's no obligation - I just think it'd be great to see them there. Most of these people are off on trips anyway.

Yuugi and Jounouchi's voices are now on the airwaves. *grins* The ad campaign is underway!

... oh yes, didn't you hear? Kaiba approved my proposal. He's going to be participating, as well as throwing in his support. Been chatting up a storm with his PR people. I had to put his name on the clipboard myself, since he's also busy and away, but he had Isis tell me he'll play.

<b>[private]</b>
I worry a little about the advanced bracket. Everybody in it wants a shot at everybody else, even though that's not how brackets work. I'll have to randomize the thing. That won't necessarily make them happy, but at least it'll be fair.

But even more basic than that... somebody needs to tell those people to have fun. I think they've forgotten how.

And I'm worried about Shizuka, too. The Pharaoh said she's staying over at the Game Shop, which is good; she's safe there. I'm not worried about her being there. I'm worried about what drove her there. He said that Marik has to be ""removed"" from her apartment. It sounds like he's not wanted there anymore. So is he going to be arrested for trespassing?

Gods, I hope so. Seeing him in jail would make my year.

"event","I was working the cash register this afternoon and happened to see Shizuka go into the game shop across the street. I can only assume she went to chat with the Pharaoh, since Yuugi's away on his trip and there's nobody else there. That's normal enough - I've seen her take walks and enjoy the waning daylight, stop in and talk with people at his shop and/or mine.

But they both came out a while later, got into his car, and drove off somewhere. When they came out of the store, I saw him flip the ""Closed"" sign, and then he turned around.

And. He. Looked. <i><b>LIVID.</b></i>

I know better than to ask, especially when I see that look on that face.

Shizuka's in good hands now. Probably the best ones Domino has to offer.

And even the gods won't help whoever incurred the Pharaoh's wrath."

"event","Good <b><i>lord</i></b>, that man's voice is piercing. I could hear him all the way from the Town Square.

Why's he whining about school, anyway? Did somebody suggest to him that he actually learn about what's right and wrong? Maybe if he started thinking with his brain and not his nether regions (unless the two are one and the same, and in his case I wouldn't be surprised), he might actually realize that he's seriously lacking in the department of higher intelligence.

But no. Of course he doesn't want to learn. He wants to bitchslap his girlfriend and screw everybody's brains out. Because that's a real show of smarts.

Don't send any census takers there. He'll eat their livers with some fava beans."

Know what would make it more high-brow? Kaiba's participation.

"event","Things are starting to pick up around the shop - I've got more customers coming in and asking for information on the upcoming tournament. I hear it's about the same over at the Kame Shop, which is cool. The only problem is, I don't have much information to give just yet, except that there's one in planning stages.

I heard back from I2 recently. Yuugi's word goes a long way with them - they've approved the grant I requested, every single yen that was in the proposal. Thanks, Yuugi, you've no idea how much that helps.

I'm gonna start putting together budgets pretty soon. A lot will go into advertisement. Hype is crucial, and I think a great way to see to it a lot of people participate is to arrange a forum one evening to hear out the various ideas and suggestions they're bound to have for the tournament. Anybody and everybody is welcome to come in and share their thoughts; you never know, you just might be helping to create policy for this thing.

Isis says she's passed my proposal to KC along to Kaiba, so hopefully I'll be hearing back from him on that soon. (Thanks again on that, Isis, I really do appreciate it.) While duel disks aren't required for a Duel Monsters tournament, playing tabletop matches would be a real come-down from them and I'd prefer to see the monsters and et cetera in action.

After the forum, I'll put up a post here on my LJ to show the tournament specifications. First and foremost on my mind is this - I want to make sure anybody who wants to play can play. I'm thinking a tiered system would do the trick: beginner level, intermediate level, and expert level. That way people who haven't played much aren't intimidated by <s>Yuugi</s> <s>Kaiba</s> the more experienced players.

Meantime... I've got to get to work. Come bother me at the store if you like - a distraction is always welcome."

have been forced to take down small posters that say:

""IN GOD WE TRUST""

The law, they say, 
is being violated. 

Anyway, we heard proposed on a radio station show, that we should all write 
'IN GOD WE TRUST' 
on the back of all our mail. After all, that's our National Motto, and it's on ALL the money we use to buy those stamps. We think it's a wonderful idea. 

WRITE IT ON THE BACK OF YOUR ENVELOPES  or front!
WE THINK THIS IS A GREAT IDEA. WE'LL START WRITING IT ON THE FRONT OF OUR ENVELOPES, TOO! !  Including Bills!!

We must take back our nation from all the people who think that anything that offends them should be removed. 

If you like this idea, please pass it on and DO IT.

Writing, ""IN GOD WE TRUST"" on our envelopes sounds good to us . 

 It's been reported that 86% of Americans believe in God. Therefore, we have a very hard time understanding why there's such a mess about having: 
""In God We Trust""  on our money and having God in the pledge of Allegiance. 

Could it be that WE just need to take action and tell the 14% to ""SIT DOWN and SHUT UP""? 

If you agree, pass this on, if not, ignore!!!"

We are all regretting the month of May as it gets closer and closer. It's hard to believe that its almost been a year since he left us. Not a minute goes by that I don't think of him, and how much I miss him. There is this emptiness inside of me. I feel like I have lost a part of myself. Sometimes I think that it should have been me that died. Its fucked up to think that, but if you knew Brandon, you'd understand. He was such an amazing person. He had such a lust for life. I will never understand why the good die so young.

"event","Understanding Why

Many people who self-harm have no idea why they're doing it. They just know they get uncontrollable urges to hurt themselves. They may worry that they're ""crazy"", or feel very upset and angry with themselves for not being able to control their behaviour. Friends and family members can also be baffled by self-harm, and not know how best to help. 
This page looks at some of the most common reasons why people hurt themselves. It discusses the needs that self-harm might be meeting and how those needs can be met in other ways.

There's always a reason
If you self-harm, you probably have good reasons for doing so. People don't hurt themselves ""just because"", or in order to be a nuisance to others. Self-harm is usually a way of coping with painful emotions. It may reduce those emotions, help you express them, or just help you function better in spite of them.

Below is a list of common reasons why people self-harm. Read through them, and see if any apply to you. If you're not sure, think back to recent occasions when you've harmed yourself. What were the circumstances that lead up to the self-harm? How did you feel before and afterwards?

Common reasons why people self-harm
to calm down when anxious, angry, overwhelmed, or tearful 
to replace emotional pain with something physical that you know how to deal with 
to release painful feelings, or take the edges off them, so you can function normally 
to prevent yourself from taking anger out on other people or hurting them 
to distract yourself from other problems in your life 
to slow things down when the world seems to be spinning too fast, or when your thoughts are racing out of control 
to help yourself focus 
to punish yourself, when you hate yourself or feel guilty, ashamed or inadequate 
to keep happiness under control, if feeling happy seems alien to you, or if you know there will be a come-down 
to feel something instead of being numb, to prove that you're alive or make yourself feel real 
to get in touch with your emotions 
to stop yourself from dissociating 
to make yourself dissociate so you can escape from your problems for a while 
as part of a ritual that helps you feel safe 
to express or communicate how you're feeling (to yourself or others) 
to prove to yourself or others that something is wrong 
to express how much you hate your body 
to help yourself get to sleep 
to prevent nightmares 
to stop flashbacks 
to stop hearing voices 
to take care of yourself by dressing the wounds afterwards - as an ""excuse"" to look after yourself 
to be taken care of by others (for example, when having your wounds treated) 
to make others notice you and your problems 
to be in control of something in your life, when everything else seems out of control 
to have a secret that others don't know about, something that is just for you 
to prove that you can cope with the pain 
because you feel anxious or freaked out if you don't do it regularly 
Exercise: Print off the list of common reasons for self-harm, or copy it into your journal. Mark those items that you think apply to you. Now add anything else that you get out of self-harm. Try to be as specific as possible. For example, instead of ""to help me cope with sexual abuse"", you might put, ""to punish myself when I feel dirty"", ""to stop flashbacks of the abuse"" and/or ""to be in control of who's hurting me"".

What if you're still not sure why you hurt yourself? Try not to worry about it too much. There are many things you can do to help yourself even if you don't understand why you're self-harming - take a look at our other self-help pages for ideas. You could also try keeping a self-harm journal where you make a note of what lead up to the self-harm and how you felt before, during and afterwards - this will help you spot patterns. A therapist might also be able to help you understand what you get out of self-harm.

Surviving Relapse

You're trying really hard not to self-harm. You've thrown away your blades, used the alternatives, and you're getting help to deal with your underlying ""issues"". You're drawing on willpower you didn't know you had and you've managed to go for longer than ever before without hurting yourself. Then something happens to trigger you, or maybe you just can't keep up the effort any more, and you end up self-harming again. Does this mean you're beyond help? Should you give up trying to get better?

Not at all! Experts on addiction (and self-harm can be very addictive) believe that relapsing is actually an important part of the recovery process. Every time we relapse, we learn more about what triggers us. By thinking about how the relapse could have been prevented, we learn new things to try on our path to recovery. Relapse can also help keep us on our toes: sometimes when we haven't self-harmed in a long time, we assume we're ""better"" and no longer need to go to therapy or take our meds or keep using self-help techniques. Sadly, this is not always the case, and relapse can serve as a useful reminder.

There are two important things to do if you relapse. The first is to keep the incident in context - don't give up hope or lose sight of your achievements. The second is to learn as much from the experience as you can and use this information to help you recover. This page also gives some advice on how to prevent relapse in the first place.

Tips for Preventing Relapse
Build up a good support network. Many people (including doctors!) tend to assume that if you're no longer self-harming, your problems are less severe and you no longer need as much help and support. In fact, your underlying problems (e.g. depression) may still be there and you may need extra support, not less, to help you cope without SI. Make sure everyone you would normally get support from knows about this. Try to find as many sources of support as you can (friends, family, health professionals, helplines, online message boards and chat rooms, self-help groups, etc). This avoids putting too much pressure on any one person and means you're less likely to be ""caught short"" when someone's unwilling or unavailable.

Try to improve your mental health overall. Don't just focus on simply ""stopping"" - self-harm is a coping mechanism and if you want to live without it in the long term, you'll probably need to find other ways of coping and tackle the issues that caused you to SI in the first place. Our Things to do instead and Tackling the causes pages can help with this. Otherwise, you might find you can go for a while without self-harming but then ""explode"" and hurt yourself worse than normal, or you might find you turn to other unhealthy ways of coping such as starving yourself or drinking too much.

Don't worry if you can't stop thinking about self-harm. This is fairly common, especially if self-harm has played a big role in your life up until now, but the thoughts should get less frequent with time. Secret Shame's Dealing with intrusive thoughts after stopping page gives some suggestions on how to cope with this.

Keeping Relapse in Context
When you end up self-harming, it's easy to feel that the weeks or months when you abstained don't count any more. This isn't true! If you went for six weeks without SI, that's an achievement which nothing can take away. You've proved that you can cope for that long without hurting yourself, and if you learn something from your relapse, hopefully you can go for even longer next time. So don't beat yourself up about it too much.

Remind yourself of your achievements so far. It can help if you write these down. How long did you go without self-harming? Were there any times you wanted to SI or came close to doing it but didn't? If there were any extenuating circumstances that lead to your relapse (for example, something unusually distressing happened to you, or you didn't have your usual support) remind yourself of these too. (They will also be useful when it comes to learning from the experience.)

If you keep track of exactly how long it is since you last self-harmed, try not to think of yourself as being back at square one. You have still achieved something, and you can learn from this experience. It might help to tell yourself something like, ""I've only self-harmed once in the last six weeks,"" rather than, ""It's only been a day since I last self-harmed.""

You might also find it helpful to read Realistic Acceptance.

Learning from Relapse
Write down exactly what happened that lead up to you self-harming. You might want to ask yourself the following questions:

What was going on in your life at the time of the relapse? Were there any particular events that triggered or upset you? 
What were you feeling before and during the relapse? 
What thoughts were running through your head? 
Could any recent changes to your treatment or recovery plan have contributed? (For example, changing your meds or no longer doing your CBT exercises.) 
Now ask yourself if you could have done anything differently that wouldn't have resulted in you self-harming. Alternatively, are there any changes you could make now to prevent something similar from happening in future? Focus on the things you can do and be realistic - for example, if the person you usually turn to for support wasn't available, accept that this is going to happen sometimes and try to widen your support network.

Remember, the idea isn't to beat yourself up about the things you did ""wrong"". It's OK to make mistakes, and not everything that contributed to you self-harming will have been your responsibility or under your control. The idea is just to learn what you can from the experience, look at what you could have done differently, find better ways of coping with the stuff you can't control, and move along down the path of recovery.

Living with self-injury
""to be nobody-but-myself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make me everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight, and never stop fighting"" -- ee cummings
As much as we'd like it to be, self-injury isn't something that can be tucked away in a little corner of your life where it doesn't touch anything else. Even after you've stopped, it continues to affect who you are and how you interact with people. Scars fade but never disappear entirely. Feelings of alienation may subside but still lurk in the background. If you're still actively hurting yourself, life gets even more complicated. This page is meant to offer some answers for the unique dilemmas self-injury brings into your life: telling others, answering intrusive questions, hiding and healing scars, and a few medical issues. I am not a medical professional and these pages are presented for informational purposes only. No diagnosis or treatment is intended. 
Coming out
Admitting to the people in your life that you self-injure is analogous in many ways to the process of coming out as gay or bi. This list of things to consider when deciding to tell those you love about your way of coping with stress is adapted from a coming-out list in Bass and Kaufman 1996. 
The assumption here is that you'll tell people about your SI in a conversation, but that's not the only way to come out. Some people have found that writing down everything they want to say and presenting it to someone has worked for them. If you choose this approach, follow the general guidelines below and be sure you remain available for discussion after the person has read what you've told them. If you want to come out to someone via email, I'd suggest you follow up immediately with a chat session or a telephone call. 

Be willing to give the other person some time to digest, though -- if you follow up with them and they say ""I'd like to think about this for a while,"" give them space. Ask them to let you know when they're ready to talk, and let it go. 


Be sensitive to the other person's feelings
It can be nearly as hard for them to hear it as it is for you to tell them. Realize that they're probably wondering what they did wrong or how they could have prevented you from feeling so much pain or why you turned out ""sick."" You don't have to accept their value judgments about your SI, but be open to hearing what they have to say about it. You might learn something, and you can teach them a great deal. 


Explain that coming out is an act of love 
Let them know that your deciding to tell them about self-injury is a sign of your love for and trust in them. Usually, a person decides to tell someone about his/her SI because s/he loves them, wants or needs their loving support, and is tired of keeping a whole part of her/himself from them. The desire to be open and to trust outweighs the fear of rejection or hatred or disgust. Let the person you're telling about your self-harm know you're not trying to punish. manipulate, or guilt-trip them. 


Pick a place that is private and a time that is unhurried 
This is serious stuff. Find a time when everyone involved is available for a long conversation. Do it in a place where everyone's comfortable and there's no need to worry about being overheard. If you're rushed or hurried or afraid other people nearby will hear and react, you're not going to be able to give your full attention to the conversation and neither will anyone else. 


Don't tell others in anger 
Don't use your SI as a weapon: ""Oh, yeah, well look, you made me cut/burn/scratch/hit!"" To get the love and understanding you're seeking, you may have to give some in return. Whether or not the person you have decided to share your secret with has contributed to the problems that led to your SI is irrelevant to the coming-out conversation. If you start getting angry and blaming, you're going to put the other person on the defensive and they'll get angry. The whole process will bog down and be hideously unpleasant and unproductive. Using SI as a weapon also increases the likelihood that the person you're coming out to will react in exactly the ways you're hoping they won't. 


Consider enlisting an ally 
If you have a friend or therapist who understands your SI you might want to ask them to sit in on the conversation. A neutral third person can help keep things calm. 


Provide as much information as you can 
This is crucial.The more someone knows about something, the less they fear it. Many people have never heard of self-injury or have heard weird sensationalized tabloid reports. Be prepared to give the person books or names of books, articles, photocopies, printouts, addresses of web sites, etc. Gather as much information as you can so you can answer their questions accurately and honestly. 


Be willing (and prepared) to answer their questions 
You may have to educate them about SI. Encourage them to ask whatever questions they may have. If they ask a question you don't have an answer to,say ""I don't know"" or ""I can't say"" or even ""I prefer not to get into that right now."" Be as open as you can. You might want to anticipate questions they'll ask and get an idea of how you want to answer those before you come out. You can ask other people who've come out what they were asked to get some ideas.
You should also have a good idea in your mind of what you want to do about the self-injury -- they're going to ask. Do you want treatment? What sort? If not, what's the rationale for not treating it? Do you want them to help you stop or control it? How can they help? What's too intrusive and what isn't? Now is a good time to start setting boundaries. 


It's not necessary to bring up the most disturbing topics in the first conversation 
Don't start by describing in technicolor detail the time you needed 43 stitches and a transfusion. It's probably best to avoid graphic descriptions of what you do; if asked, just say ""I cut myself on the wrist"" or ""I hit the walls until I get bruises"" or whatever. Try not to freak them out; you can give details (if necessary) in some other conversation. 


Trust your own judgment 
Do what feels natural to you. You know yourself and your family and friends far better than I ever will. 


Communicate 
Be willing to talk to the people you're coming out to about your reactions, and ask them to let you know what they're thinking. Communication goes both ways. 
Scars
For some people, scars aren't an issue -- they self-injure in ways that don't leave permanent marks or they only injure in places that are normally covered by clothing (the torso, shoulders, etc). For most people who cut or burn, though, scars happen. Some people like their scars and look on them as battle wounds or even life-maps. Many others hate their scars and want to find ways to get rid of them. Both attitudes are equally valid. 
The two most common scar questions I hear are ""How do I explain them?"" and ""How do I make them go away?"" 


Dealing with unpleasant questions
It happens sooner or later - you're at school or work, on the bus, in a shop, and someone notices. ""What happened to your {arm, leg, face, whatever}?""
People aren't usually trying to make you uncomfortable. Quite often, they're just making conversation; they don't really want to know why you have scars, but it's something to say. Nevertheless, you're stuck coming up with an answer.

Quite often, the easiest solution is to half-laugh or make a rueful face and say ""It's a long story."" Then change the topic. This deflects most people; if they persist, you can say, ""I would really rather not discuss this."" You can be a bit icy here -- after all, they're being a bit rude by asking you personal questions and not letting you gracefully avoid answering.

On the other hand, you could try some of the suggestions that came up during a discussion of excuses on the bus email list. You prolly won't use most of them, but read them for the laughs: 

I had unprotected sex with a porcupine. 
I took my lizards for a walk and they held on for dear life. 
The neighborhood cat and I had a disagreement about the paw prints on my truck. 
The police didn't comply with the terrorists' demands fast enough, so they took it out on us hostages. 
This first one is kind of lame, but it's what I use most often: ""Um, uh...I, uh....you see....I...uh...Well,...."" At which they usually try to help me out by replying, ""Did you fall?"" And I say, ""Yes, thanks."" 
Well, let me just tell you this: You should NEVER EVER, under ANY circumstances, go out with a guy/girl that you met on the internet. 
I hurt myself. 
I keep falling off of cliffs trying to catch that damned roadrunner. 
""I was oyster hunting."" They give me a blank stare. Then I say, with a wink, ""You've obviously never been oyster hunting before."" 
""It's a long story."" They usually leave me alone, but this one guy said, ""I've got time."" Then I said, ""I fell. [long pause] Ok, so it's obviously not THAT long."" 
I was at this party with Marilyn Manson and everyone was giving out hugs. 
I lost a fight with a can of tuna fish. 
I slipped while making a salad. 
I fell asleep, and the clown got me. 
I'll just put it this way: when they tell you not to feed the bears, it's for a damned good reason. 
I thought those security tags on pants just sprayed ink, but apparently they spray shards of broken glass, too. 
Those aren't cuts, they're mehendi. 
Don't worry about it. Because of me, they now have a warning label! 
What are you talking about?? (as I quickly pull my sleeves up.) 
Damn Cat. 
Well, when I was younger, I had this dream that a dog was following me...he ran, and I ran, but the faster I ran, the more he sped up. I wanted to get to safety, to my house...I was almost there...but right when I got to the front porch, he bit me. Everywhere. Lots of times. Making marks that don't look like bites at all. And when I woke up... ::wide eyes:: and I had THESE. 
""What scars?"" They usually reply ""those ones,"" to which I reply, ""I don't see anything."" 
The voices told me to do it. 
I wrestle Tigers... 
I got them climbing a fence to escape this hell-hole. (said at school) 
(said to a guy who thinks I worship the devil) I did this as a sacramental offering to my dark lord, you prick. ::Smile:: 
(about scars on my stomach) ""Oh, those are from having my baby."" ""You don't have a baby!"" ""No, but I could."" 
None of your business, you stupid (insert appropriate curse word here) 
I did it. (Hey, honesty works sometimes) 
Dealing with scars themselves
If you hate your scars and want to do something about them, you have two options: You can find ways to conceal your scars, or you can try to heal/minimize them. 
Hiding scars
Sometimes it's possible to hide scars. 
Wrist scars can be covered by long sleeves, bracelets, or watches. 
In summer, wear long-sleeved shirts of light material (silk, gauzy cotton, and the like). 
Another summer idea is to wear a long-sleeved shirt open over a tank top or t-shirt. If anyone questions it, you can tell them you're worried about sun exposure. 
Some leg scars in women can be hidden by pantyhose or tights. 
Concealer makeup (like Dermablend) can be used to hide some scars. You can get more info at dermablend.com. People have reported getting very good results with Dermablend, which was formulated for covering port-wine birthmarks and skin conditions like vitiligo. It's waterproof and can be blended to match skin color very closely. 
Healing scars
The first step in healing scars is probably good wound care. Wash with Betadine if appropriate, and use a good antibiotic ointment (like Neosporin) on the wound daily. Johnson & Johnson make a new bandage, Band-Aid Advanced Healing, that seals the wound completely. Fluids from the wound are absorbed by special particles in the bandage that turn them into a gel to cushion the wound. This keeps the wound moist, which reduces itching and helps it heal faster. It also can reduce the urge to pick at the wound, because you are meant to keep the bandage on continuously until the wound has healed, or about a week.

For some types of scarring, special creams or bandages may help. Mederma is a cream designed to minimize scarring, but it must be used when the scar is very new. Reports on its efficacy are mixed. 

There are several brands of silicone sheets and pads available: 

Rejuveness

Syprex 

Clinicel (a cushion)

Cicacare 
ReTouch 
ScarFX 
ScarEase 

Mepiform 

to name a few. Syprex also makes a cream, a topical gel, and a special cleansing wipe. A new product, ScarGuard, combines liquid silicone, mild cortisone, and vitamin E. You paint the liquid over the scars to form something similar to a silicone sheet, and use it in the same way you use the sheets. 

Silicone sheets are taped tightly (a few now are self-adhesive) over the scars for several hours each day. Treatment continues for varying lengths of time (days to weeks). The manufacturers claim that these sheet can soften and fade most raised or red scars, even keloids. Some burn centers do use them to help diminish scarring after grafts, and unlike Mederma, they are meant for old scars as well as new. None of these products will make scars disappear but they can help make them less obvious (and cut down on intrusive questions. I've seen Rejuveness and Cicacare at Walgreen's in the US.

Curad recently introduced ScarTherapy, a new product for reducing scar tissue. It uses polyurethane instead of silicone, which allows air to get through; instead of wearing the sheet a few hours every day, you wear it continually; each day you take off the old sheet and put on a new self-adhesive one. Like the silicone sheets, it claims to be able to flatten and lighten scars (in other words, none of these will do much for flat scars that are paler than surrounding skin). I'm interested in hearing reports on this product; if you try this, email me. 

Plastic surgery might be effective for some sorts of scarring, but it is very expensive and leaves scars of its own. Dermabrasion might work for very light scarring, but I've heard from several people who found it useless, expensive, and painful. The same holds for laser resurfacing. I've not heard of either working well for SI scars -- if you know of someone it's helped (or it helped you), please email me. 

Cortisone injections combined with laser therapy can flatten large keloids, but you'll still have a remnant of a scar. The treatment can be painful, and results aren't guaranteed. 

Skin grafts can be done to reduce a network of scars to one big scar which can be more easily explained, but they still leave you with a big ugly scar. Someone reported having wedge surgery in which the scarred areas were cut out in a wedge and skin edges sewn back together, leaving one long scar. I've also heard about a procedure in which balloons are slipped under the skin and slowly inflated to stretch the skin out. The loose skin is then sewn over the scarred area. If you know anything about this, I'd love to hear details. 

If you decide to have plastic surgery done, you will have to convince your surgeon that you are through self-injuring; most doctors will not help you cover scars if they think you're going to go out and get new ones right away. Some may require that you be SI-free for a set period of time before they'll consider doing the surgery. 

Tattooing over scars may be an option for some people, but scarred skin is very difficult to work with and may not hold ink well. If you want to try this route, ask around and check references until you find a very good, very experienced tattoo artist and set up a meeting to discuss the possibilities. If the artist thinks tattoos wouldn't work well on your scar, it might be best to drop the idea. Again, this is something to do only if you're pretty sure you're not going to scar the area afterward. 

A good source for information about scars and plastic surgery is http://www.scarcare.org. Remember that nothing can make the scar go away completely; treatments can only change the shape, appearance, or location of it."

"event","Bill of Rights for People Who Self-Harm
Preamble
An estimated one percent of Americans use physical self-harm as a way of coping with stress; the rate of self-injury in other industrial nations is probably similar. Still, self-injury remains a taboo subject, a behavior that is considered freakish or outlandish and is highly stigmatized by medical professionals and the lay public alike. Self-harm, also called self-injury, self-inflicted violence, or self-mutilation, can be defined as self-inflicted physical harm severe enough to cause tissue damage or leave visible marks that do not fade within a few hours. Acts done for purposes of suicide or for ritual, sexual, or ornamentation purposes are not considered self-injury. This document refers to what is commonly known as moderate or superficial self-injury, particularly repetitive SI; these guidelines do not hold for cases of major self-mutilation (i.e., castration, eye enucleation, or amputation).
Because of the stigma and lack of readily available information about self-harm, people who resort to this method of coping often receive treatment from physicians (particularly in emergency rooms) and mental-health professionals that can actually make their lives worse instead of better. Based on hundreds of negative experiences reported by people who self-harm, the following Bill of Rights is an attempt to provide information to medical and mental-health personnel. The goal of this project is to enable them to more clearly understand the emotions that underlie self-injury and to respond to self-injurious behavior in a way that protects the patient as well as the practitioner.



The Bill of Rights for Those who Self-Harm
The right to caring, humane medical treatment.
Self-injurers should receive the same level and quality of care that a person presenting with an identical but accidental injury would receive. Procedures should be done as gently as they would be for others. If stitches are required, local anesthesia should be used. Treatment of accidental injury and self-inflicted injury should be identical.

The right to participate fully in decisions about emergency psychiatric treatment (so long as no one's life is in immediate danger).
When a person presents at the emergency room with a self-inflicted injury, his or her opinion about the need for a psychological assessment should be considered. If the person is not in obvious distress and is not suicidal, he or she should not be subjected to an arduous psych evaluation. Doctors should be trained to assess suicidality/homicidality and should realize that although referral for outpatient follow-up may be advisable, hospitalization for self-injurious behavior alone is rarely warranted.

The right to body privacy. 
Visual examinations to determine the extent and frequency of self-inflicted injury should be performed only when absolutely necessary and done in a way that maintains the patient's dignity. Many who SI have been abused; the humiliation of a strip-search is likely to increase the amount and intensity of future self-injury while making the person subject to the searches look for better ways to hide the marks.

The right to have the feelings behind the SI validated. 
Self-injury doesn't occur in a vacuum. The person who self-injures usually does so in response to distressing feelings, and those feelings should be recognized and validated. Although the care provider might not understand why a particular situation is extremely upsetting, she or he can at least understand that it *is* distressing and respect the self-injurer's right to be upset about it.

The right to disclose to whom they choose only what they choose. 
No care provider should disclose to others that injuries are self-inflicted without obtaining the permission of the person involved. Exceptions can be made in the case of team-based hospital treatment or other medical care providers when the information that the injuries were self-inflicted is essential knowledge for proper medical care. Patients should be notified when others are told about their SI and as always, gossiping about any patient is unprofessional.

The right to choose what coping mechanisms they will use. 
No person should be forced to choose between self-injury and treatment. Outpatient therapists should never demand that clients sign a no-harm contract; instead, client and provider should develop a plan for dealing with self-injurious impulses and acts during the treatment. No client should feel they must lie about SI or be kicked out of outpatient therapy. Exceptions to this may be made in hospital or ER treatment, when a contract may be required by hospital legal policies.

The right to have care providers who do not allow their feelings about SI to distort the therapy. 
Those who work with clients who self-injure should keep their own fear, revulsion, anger, and anxiety out of the therapeutic setting. This is crucial for basic medical care of self-inflicted wounds but holds for therapists as well. A person who is struggling with self-injury has enough baggage without taking on the prejudices and biases of their care providers.

The right to have the role SI has played as a coping mechanism validated. 
No one should be shamed, admonished, or chastised for having self-injured. Self-injury works as a coping mechanism, sometimes for people who have no other way to cope. They may use SI as a last-ditch effort to avoid suicide. The self-injurer should be taught to honor the positive things that self-injury has done for him/her as well as to recognize that the negatives of SI far outweigh those positives and that it is possible to learn methods of coping that aren't as destructive and life-interfering.

The right not to be automatically considered a dangerous person simply because of self-inflicted injury. 
No one should be put in restraints or locked in a treatment room in an emergency room solely because his or her injuries are self-inflicted. No one should ever be involuntarily committed simply because of SI; physicians should make the decision to commit based on the presence of psychosis, suicidality, or homicidality.

The right to have self-injury regarded as an attempt to communicate, not manipulate. 
Most people who hurt themselves are trying to express things they can say in no other way. Although sometimes these attempts to communicate seem manipulative, treating them as manipulation only makes the situation worse. Providers should respect the communicative function of SI and assume it is not manipulative behavior until there is clear evidence to the contrary."

"event","My toe was hurting really bad, so I called my doctor. Then a few minutes later I got a call from the ER to take a shower and head over because they were going to do the surgery on my toe. So I did what they said and headed over there. As soon as I told them my name they brought me right into a room and took some blood. Then about an hour later they came in and started 2 IV's. One on my right arm with normal saline and one in my left arm with antibiotics. Then they told me that my toe was VERY infected and they had to remove my toe nail on my left side, but wanted to give it a little while to let the antibiotics work a little, before they cut it open. About 2 hours later they came in and prepped for the surgery. They numbed the toe, with 3 shots right into the affected area (which was very painful and I screamed the whole time), and left the room. 10 minutes later they came back in and he began the surgery, but as soon as he touched it, I screamed bloody murder because it wasn't fully numbed. He began to explain that because it was so infected and the nail was so thick that they would not be able to numb it comfortably enough to do the surgery. He said he was going to have to knock me out to do it. I agreed (of course), because I didn't want to feel any more pain. 30 minutes later another Nurse came in and gave me a shot in my hand because of the IV's, and because she couldn't put it through the IV, because it would be too dangerous, and I had 2 IV's on both my arms so she had to use my hand. Literally 2 minutes later the world started to spin and everything went black. I woke up a bit later and felt immediately like shit, but the surgery went well. The doctor said that when he cut the toe nail in half to remove it better, the infection started pouring out (sounded gross). He told me to rest for a bit and finish the IV's and antibiotics and if I was up to it, he was sending me home. Another 3 hours later, I was feeling way better (my toe still hurt like hell), so he began the discharge process. He gave me two precocets to take right there for when the numbing wore off (it was still a little numb from the shots). He wrote up all the discharge after-care, and had my foot put in a post-op shoe to protect it while it heals. He told me that I had to soak it once a day and change my bandage. He also said that I wasn't allowed to walk on it for 5-7 days and that I had to keep it elevated until the swelling goes down and t starts to heal. He gave me antibiotics and pain meds (hydrocodone) and sent me on my way. I also have to follow-up with my doctor to get the nail bed cauterized so the nail can't grow back, so I don't have to go through all that again. It was pretty crazy but I am feeling a lot better today. My toe is healing nicely and the only problem I have is having to sit around all day doing nothing, since I was taken out of work for a week. It sucks but I am hanging in there, I got good friends who are keeping me occupied. Well that's it for now, Ciao."

"event","Just thought I'd write a quick post so the few people (if any) who actually reads this would know that I did not fall off the face of the Earth. Things are fine right now. I am being forced to get back into drug treatment, because I smoked a little Pot at a party, and I wasn't even drinking, it was the only thing in my system. Pretty lame, but eh, what can you do? Also, my family is still completely torn apart over the loss of our beloved brother and my mom announced this evening that she was leaving my step-father after 17 years. She says it was meant to happen even with everything that's going on right now and she would have done it even if Brandon hadn't died. I am understandably upset by this news because when Brandon died and the family was unfathomably heartbroken, she promised to stand by my step-father no matter what and now it seems because she found someone new she wants to end it all. I don't really know what to think. She is an amazing person and an amazing mother, all my friends have been jealous of the closeness that we share, and I know that she deserves to be happy. I just can't bear to see my step-dad hurt so much when she leaves, I know it will destroy him. He has already lost a son in a car accident and a daughter that hates him and refuses to see or even speak to him. He even said it that night, What does he have to live for? But we told him he had us and we will always be his family, now it seems like everyone is giving up. 

And I cannot believe that after everything that has happened and is happening that I am not completely insane. I should be proud, but all I can see is a nobody that is melting from the inside out. Curious huh?"

"event","Things are going ok. I have completely healed from my brush with death and have even moved out of my old apartment into the one directly below it. It is a lot bigger and I don't have to climb those crazy stairs anymore. I had to wait 9 days to get my internet transferred though, which sucked. But everything is working great now and they even gave me a discount for two months, which was awesome because my bill was only $14.05 this month for my internet and my phone. Also, me and my EX (ugh!!) finally split. A day after my brush with death (getting mugged) I was at home, and was crushing up one of my percocet's to snort (not good but eh) when Simon showed up. He said he had gotten kicked out of the friends house he was staying at and had been living in his truck, and the first thing he noticed was the pills. He immediately asked me for one or for me to share and I told him ""no"" because for one I needed them and for two, I hadn't seen or heard from him in like 2 weeks and was already angry and annoyed that he never came by or even called me. He seemed ok with it. I pretty much ignored him for the few minutes he was there, because I pretty much figured out that he was a loser because he was trying to hint around that I should let him move in and support him (HAHAHA!!) So finally he stands up, asks me for a cigarette for the road and departs. About 20 minutes later I hear a knock at my door. I ask who it is and they reply ""state police"". All of my friends say that when I ask who it is as a joke, and it sounded like my best friends boyfriend, so I stand up, laughing, snort a line and go over and open the door. And a COP is standing there. My jaw just drops, which I know he noticed. I close the door a little since the pill is sitting on my computer desk, already crushed up. He asks to come in and I say ""no"" because my cat isn't very friendly and I am afraid he might bite him (my cat is extremely friendly by the way). The cop says its ok to talk in the hallway, so I go out in the hallway and he says he got a call about 20 minutes ago by someone who said I was snorting prescription drugs in my home. I laughed and said if it was Simon Reckson then he is just pissed off because I wouldn't support his damn drug habit by giving him medicine that I need. So he asked me where I got them and if he could see them, so I said ""sure"" and went back inside and grabbed the bottle and all the paperwork from the hospital. I came back out and handed them to him, and he asked me what happened as he was reading through everything and examining the bottle. I told him the whole incident with the mugging and he seemed genuinely concerned and shit. He then handed me back the paperwork, put on a plastic glove and dumped the bottle of pills out in his hand and started counting them. I had just gotten the prescription filled maybe an hour before he arrived, so there was only 2 missing and since the script was dated for that day and it was already like 8pm he seemed satisfied that two were missing because the instructions were to take 1-2 pills every 4-6 hours for severe pain. I told him I had taken one this morning (HAHA) and one about and hour ago because my headache flared up again which was true because I had a non-stop headache. He said all was well and that I didn't look like I was under the influence and I laughed and said that it was just my EX pissed off because I wouldn't give him any, and he said it sounded shitty because of the circumstances by which I had the pills to begin with and I laughed again and was like ""yeah I know that's why I dumped him 20 min. ago, I guess this is his way of trying to get back at me"". The cop wished me a good day and left. I was freaking out, thinking the cop didn't believe my story which was dumb because I knew he totally bought it, and I started clearing everything out of my house. I threw away my pill crusher (which I got on my trip to Vermont with my best-est friend Brooke), and my two pipes. I miss them now and regret it because the cop has never returned.

In other news:
I am preparing for the huge party my Aunt and Uncle are throwing to celebrate the completion of their new house. They own their own business and are filthy rich (must be nice, but they give great presents so its all good). They have spent over $7,000 on the party which is taking place this Saturday at 2pm. It is going to rock!! They are going to have booze, tons of food, a DJ, Karaoke, a cotton candy machine, a chocolate making machine (hmmmm...), a bowling game, a dart game, a pin-ball machine, a dunking booth and so much more. I cannot wait. I am allowed to bring a friend and I have not decided who to bring yet because I don't want anyone to get mad at me or anything.

That's pretty much everything. I will try to write more again soon, but I don't think anyone even reads this so I don't put too much effort into it. Ciao."

"event","Things are still bad but im hanging in there, me and my step-father have patched things up somewhat, but that is pretty much only due to an incident that occured about 8 days ago. It was about 1:30am and I was walking home from work by myself (which I no longer do, so please dont yell at me about it) and a man was walking towards me on the sidewalk going in the opposite direction and when he was almost directly beside me I felt like something was tugging on my purse and the next thing I know I was flying to the ground and my head was smashed onto the sidewalk, I was winded a little and disoriented and my glasses had flown off so I began searching for them with my hands when I was kicked in the side. I found my glasses, grabbed them and got up quick and started to run when I ran headfirst into something, which colided with my head yet again and I fell back down again, I heard laughter and heard footsteps running away seconds after. I got up ::winded and lightheaded:: and ran the rest of the way to my house and called a closest friend for help. I brushed away their pleas to call the police and go to the hospital until the next night when I started throwing up and was extremely weak and dizzy. I knew I had a concussion immediately and went straight to the ER. They did a CT and it showed swelling on the left side of my brain due to the blunt trauma. Apparently the unknown gentlemen had smashed me right on my temple with something very heavy, plus the fall to the sidewalk and the collision with the untility pole had caused quite enough dmamage. So they loaded me up with a morphine shot and 2 pain killers known as Percocets and sent me home with a shitload of the Percocets noting that I would definitely be needing them. So I spent a few days very drugged up and still with a massive headache. When my step-father found out about it, he immediately rushed to my aide demanding I tell him who hit me because he was raised to never hit women and alot of people around here agree. Of course, I know who the guy was and have not told my step-father for fear of him getting hurt since he said he ""loved me"" during our last conversation. But the guy is a well known gang member and my loyal friends are working on the revenge as we speak, much to my protests. But I am letting them have their fun, knowing they won't find the guy because he has already traveled 6 hours away to go back home, so they wont ever find him and no more blood and bruises have to be shed and I learned a very valuable lesson AGAIN!!

"event","On Wednesday May 30th, at around 5pm, we received a phone call that there was an accident down the road from my parents house. I had been there for the first time in awhile to ride the new four wheeler they had gotten and to spend some time with my family. The person said that they had heard it was my little brother Brandon and that he didn't make it. We flipped and rushed to the scene. My mom and Dad (step-father) got out to talk to the police to see if it was Brandon, while me and my sister waited in the car. After an agonizing 10 minutes a man pulled up and stepped out carrying a wallet and we knew it was him. We jumped out and ran to my parents and just sobbed uncontrollably, while the police sent words of comfort. My mom comforted my Dad and I held my sister while she threw up beside the car. 

We got ourselves somewhat together and got back in the car and headed back to the house to find out where everyone was so we could join them and help comfort Brandon's biological sister Tabitha, as me; my sister Christina and brother Anthony are siblings only through marriage but consider ourselves more than that because we grew up together. We started receiving phone calls in quick succession, and my parents flew out the door, while my siblings and I explained to the rest of the family and comforted each other. A short while later I received a phone call from my mother to get ahold of Tabitha, who was Brandon's sister, and see where she was, so her father could be with her. She gave me her cell phone number and I gathered myself as best I could with my brother and sister by my side and placed the call. I got her answering machine so I left a message telling her I was so sorry to hear the news and to let her know her father was searching for her because he wanted to be with her and comfort her. 

The most heart-wrenching part of it all happened next but a little background information is necessary first. Brandon and Tabitha's mother, who is Dale's ex-wife, has had it out for Dale and has always said he was a worthless father and didn't care for his children, and she has been brainwashing her children to think that too. So when they both grew up and stopped coming over as much, a void was placed between them. Every time Dale tried to contact his children, he was ripped into by Becky, who was his ex-wife and Brandon and Tabitha's mother, so to save his children grief he stopped calling their house but never stopped loving them and always welcomed them anytime. After a while Brandon and Tabitha started hating their father for not being there for them even though he always was there and loved them so deeply. Brandon had lost contact with his father completely and started calling him his sperm donor and not his father. He never came around and said on several occasions how much he hated him. Me and my brother always remained close to Brandon even though we too had lost contact for a few years. Every time we saw him, we urged him to make up with his father and reminded him how much he loved him and wanted to be in his life. He never listened to us and remained stuck to believing that his father had never loved him because of all the lies he had been hearing over the years. Becky had won and he turned his own children against him. 

After the phone call was placed, my parents returned a short while later, with some of Dale's cousins. Then the phone rang again and I answered it and it was Tabitha and Brandon's Aunt Mary and they wanted to speak to Dale. I figured they were just going to tell him where they all were, so he could be with his daughter, but just as I was handing the phone to Dale, I heard Tabitha screaming in the background that his son was dead and it was all his fault. I tried to grab the phone back, but Dale had already taken it. I rushed back into the house to let my mom know that they were planning on hurting Dale further and for her to take the phone from him before they could really destroy him, but it was too late. They had screamed at Dale saying that I had called screaming at Tabitha, starting trouble; even though both my sister and brother had witnessed the call and knew no such thing had happened. 

I went back outside and Dale was hysterical asking who it was on the phone that had just screamed at him and I said it was Mary. He lost it and began screaming at me; believing that I had started the trouble to begin with. I was already devastated myself and began to get very angry that the father that I had known for so long and loved like my real father could really think that I would do such a terrible thing. I ran back inside and slammed the door (a very big mistake) and went to my old room. Dale followed completely not himself and continuing to scream at me as I cowered in my doorway. My brother, who is very protective of me, began punching the wall (another big mistake), which made Dale completely lose it. He shoved me roughly into a storage cabinet right inside the doorway and went for my brother, screaming that it should have been him that died, not Brandon, saying he would kill him. My mother stepped in between them trying to force them apart screaming. I was punching Dale and grabbing his shirt trying to pull him off my mother fearing she would get hurt, frantically trying to protect my brother, while my sister screamed for Dale's cousins to come and restrain him, because emotions were running so high.

Dale's cousins ran in and grabbed him and dragged him outside leaving the family that truly loved him more than anything; shaking, bruised and crying in his wake. We grabbed our things and my mother rushed us outside to her car giving my sister the keys and the task of bringing me and my brother to my apartment and going to home to let Dale cool down. We were hysterical and so worried that Dale would hurt our mother, so we didn't get more than a few feet away from the house before we came back (and I don't think my sister could drive anyway because she was shaking so badly). We pulled back in the drive-way completely out of our minds with grief and pain as our whole world turned upside down. My mother rushed to the car to calm us, while we begged her to come with us, fearing for her safety. We were just so scared and hurt. She calmed us somewhat explaining that Dale would never hurt her and he had just thought I had really made that horrible phone call, and that he was completely destroyed knowing he had lost his son without reconciling, and that he just lost it and would regret it. We realized what had happened when we calmed down a little more and instantly feared that he may try to take his own life and begged her to protect him while also remaining away from the line of fire if he lost it again. She assured us she would be fine and that she would not leave her husband's side.

We left after a lot of hugs, kisses and ""I Love You's"", and made our way slowly back to my apartment in Plattsburgh. My mother had expressed to my sister to drive safely because her whole world was in the car. So me and my brother spent the trip shaking and completely out our minds with grief, but staying in control, by keeping my sister calm so we could all get where we were going safely. We were under orders to call mom the second we arrived. We got to my apartment, said our good-bye's and ""I Love You's"" to Christina and rushed in to call mom. She picked up after the second try and assured us that Dale already regretted it dearly and has calmed down now that he knows it was just Becky and Mary being the selfish bitches they are and not me.

Me and my brother, lost in grief and anguish at the day's events, immediately began searching for the one thing that would make it bearable enough to sleep and that was drugs. (not a good thing, but we were so overwhelmed and feared we may lose it ourselves) We smoked and put in a nice funny movie to take our minds off the horrible events of the evening. We began to sober up a little and was ready to head to bed when there was a knock at my door. I pulled back the shades and saw my cousin who I hadn't seen in a long time standing there. I opened the door and she immediately asked me what was wrong and I led her into my bedroom, because I knew I would break down and didn't want to upset my brother as he was already blaming himself. I started explaining the nights events, kind of angry that I had to relive it so soon but grateful that she was there. We talked and cried for a long time until I could no longer stay awake as I had not had any sleep for the past two nights and was completely exhausted. So we said our ""goodbye's"" and she left, leaving me to my own thoughts as the world quickly went black and I drifted off to sleep. 

My mother and Dale showed up the very next day with food, cigarettes and comfort. Dale was unbelievably upset about what he did, and wanted to come and get my garbage for me and check on us right away. Although I was still bruised, broken, completely petrified and overcome with grief, I made my way downstairs to the truck where Dale was with my mother by my side. We chatted for a bit until mom went back inside and Dale immediately apologized about the night before and I told him that I loved him so much and there was no need to apologize. We chatted for quite awhile and even shared a few laughs, in the midst of our grief. They left a short while later, leaving me and Anthony alone again with our own thoughts. 

The next day my mom came over to get us and bring us to the house so we could all be together. I was worried about my cat and didn't want to just leave him for so long, and I didn't want it to be real and was avoiding having to face that Brandon (my beloved brother) was gone. Plus, I was still a little scared remembering the hatred in my father's (Dale's) eyes when he was screaming at me and when he shoved me. So I was left alone. I smoked myself stupid and lost it. I was overcome with grief and couldn't bear being alone, even though I had only been alone for a few hours. I contacted my counselor, who immediately rushed me to Peru to be with my family, leaving my beloved cat (Squeakers) alone for what I knew to be the longest time he would ever be alone.

When I arrived I immediately wanted to go to 22B which is the road that Brandon had died on (less than a mile from my parents home) because a memorial had been set up, and friends and family had been gathering there to mourn our beloved Brandon. We left and when we got there, there were already several people there. I took a deep breath and got out of the car and headed over. I looked around and was amazed at how beautifully decorated it was. I let the people gathered there know who I was, and they immediately ran to me and embraced me as they were close friends of Brandon. We clutched each other and cried not even knowing who we all were but were joined together in all the grief and pain that we felt.I left after consoling the grief-stricken teenagers and returned back to my parents house. My sister arrived a short while later saying that there was at least 20-30 kids gathered at the memorial on 22B and that we should go to comfort them. I grabbed a picture of the 5 of us when we were little and we headed out with Dale at our side after much pleas that he go. We were not there long when we realized that Tabitha (Brandon's sister) was there. 

My sister sat next to her first and asked her if it was ok that we and Dale attend the wake, because we didn't want a fight to break out when we are supposed to be mourning him. She assured her that nothing would happen at the wake because Brandon would have wanted it that way. I sat down beside her too because I wanted to make sure she wasn't angry at me, and that she knew how much I love her. She acknowledged me and told me she was not angry and that she wanted us all to go because it's what Brandon would have wanted.I was so relieved that she was not angry because I love her so and really wanted to be there for her and comfort her. I was still a little worried because she was so drunk and wasn't sure if she really meant it, and it wasn't just the alcohol talking.We went back to the truck and when we got back in the car we told Dale that Tabitha was there and that she assured us that everything would be fine for him to attend the wake because that's what Brandon would have wanted. So we headed back, Christina left to get back to her kids and husband and we went to sleep knowing the wake was the very next day.

We awoke early on Sunday morning, showered, dressed, and when my Uncle and Aunt arrived (they were driving us to the wake) we left, still afraid that a scene would take place. We arrived and went inside after a quick smoke, and found that it was an open casket. As soon as everyone realized it they broke down seeing our beloved brother lying there so still. It was heart-wrenching and a sight I will never forget. Things went smoothly as hundreds and I mean hundreds (he was loved by so many) came and went paying their respects. It was beautifully decorated and the cards holding a picture of him when he was small and one when he was all-grown up side by side, held a beautiful poem on the back:

In Loving Memory of
Brandon A. Bradley
April 1, 1989
May 30, 2007

""Don't grieve for me, for now I'm free. I'm following the path God laid for me, I took his hand when I heard him call, I turned my back and left it all. I could not stay another day to laugh, to love, to work or play. Tasks left undone must stay that way. I found that place at the close of the day. Perhaps my time seemed all too brief. Don't lengthen it now with undue grief. Lift up your heart and share with me. God wanted me now, he set me free.""

We waited outside gathering ourselves and finally made our way back inside and around to Tabitha, her mom Becky and her husband Ray and gave our hugs and words of comfort. Becky (still angry believing that I said those terrible things, barely acknowledged me and I never received a hug), I was heart-broken and confused not knowing what I did so wrong and ran back outside to sob by myself. My sister arrived a short while later and we gathered our brother and left back to the house. She dropped us off and returned to her children, and me and my brother still lost in our own grief, smoked ourselves stupid again until a good friend of Anthony's arrived to comfort him. A short while later a friend of mine arrived and we sat in the house, reminiscing and looking at old photo albums. 

A few hours later my mom and Dad arrived bringing news that there will be no further hate towards any of us by Becky, assuring us that her own sister Tracy had explained it and she had dropped her cruel vendetta in completely destroying us and even invited my parents to the gathering afterwards at her OWN house!! They left a few minutes later and I arranged to head back to my house just for the night, to be with my cat because he had already been alone for over 24 hours and I was feeling bad that I left him. My good friends Keisha and Dan picked me up and we stopped to get pills on the way to my apartment and I spent the rest of the evening with my friends hanging out, getting fucked up and trying to cope with everything that has happened. My case-manager agreed to take me to Peru the following morning so I could attend the funeral and burial services.

Squeakers was very happy to see me, and after they left, we spent some much needed quality time together. Then I cleaned my house from top to bottom to get rid of this crazy energy and now I am writing this. Phewww! I have had the worst week of my life, but I am somewhat relieved that Tabitha and Becky do not hate us, because we loved Brandon so much and still do, he was OUR little brother and we all grew up together. He was our family and so isn't Tabitha, and I would give anything to have him back.

Brandon,
I will always remember the good times. Riding our new bikes we got for Easter in the yard; jumping ramps, birthday parties, weddings, graduations, and just hanging around the house watching Hocus Pocus and dancing to silly music. It's hard to believe that I will never see your smiling face or hear your voice, and words cannot express how much I will miss you brother. We were all together, growing up and picking on each other, but we had such a deep love for each other that will never be forgotten. We helped each other through the good times and the bad. I will miss you so very much, life will never be the same without you. Peace be with you my beloved brother until we are together again in heaven, I love you."

"event","I spent most of the day yesterday trying to find pills for one of my friends. She was really persistent and annoying, and really starting to piss me off. Then my friend Katie showed up with a little surprise. She pulls out a bag with 5 beautiful blue pills in it and starts laughing cause my mouth just dropped. It was great, because she knew how frustrated I was trying to find them for my other friend, even tho I wasn't really trying to find any for myself. So we begin crushing them up and getting pretty fucked up. After my mom left, we did the last of the pills and starting packing bowl after bowl. We were fucking wrecked, it was great. We watched movies and played on the internet and played cards. It was a memorable evening.

Now I am recovering from the nights events, and packing to get ready to head back to my apartment. I still haven't been back really; since the event on Saturday night. I am going to make my brother come with me, so I am not going alone on my first night back. I can't wait to get back to my apartment and have my privacy again. I love my family but can only stand them for so long and they start irritating me. I get paid tonight so I am going to try and get some drugs so I can get fucked up and not worry about being in that apartment with that monster on the loose. It should be a peaceful evening. Write in you again soon. Ciao."

"event","More Updates:
So me and my mom spent the morning in Plattsburgh together. First she brought me to my friend Kelly's house so I could visit with her for a little while. Then we went and got my new glasses and went straight to the hardware store. We got a bolt-lock and an extra set of keys and headed to my apartment. We installed the bolt-lock and turned my apartment into a fortress;making it impossible for an intruder and I mean IMPOSSIBLE!! There are three locks; a regular lock on the door knob, a bolt-lock, and a chain lock, lol. Then we decorated the apartment a little more and then left on a shopping trip thru Plattsburgh. I LOVE MOMMY TIME!! So for the first time since the attempted abduction on Saturday I am starting to feel safer and less vulnerable. 

Guy Trouble:
Well, I am being pursued by 3 guys right now. One is a complete jerk and thinks a woman is put on this earth for nothing more than to please the man. The Second is a compulsive liar, who even steals from his own family and couldnt be on time for anything even if it was to save his own life. The third is Scott. Well, the thing about him is that he is 17, and still childish; even tho I am too, but he has alot of problems. The thing they ALL have in common is that they all want me. AHHHH!!!!

Tonight is going to be fun. I have many friends coming over to welcome me back, and we are all going to get really fucked up, lol. It should be an interesting night."

I have not wrote in sooo long. I have been very busy and have so many updates to talk about....where to begin.......

Scary News:
I was walking from my apartment to my moms work about 4 streets away and was on Weed St. when a car pulled up beside me on the left hand side and the guy asked if i was lost and needed a ride and I said ""no"" and he immediately grabbed my arm and tried to hold on to me as he was trying to open his door. I screamed right when he grabbed me and tried to pull away, i realized it wasnt working and knew i had to get away before he opened his door. I twisted my entire body and he lost his grip on me. I ran as fast as i could back onto miller st and ducked behind all the houses and started jumping fences. I tripped over the first one and hurt my ankle but kept running. I got to my friend kellys house and calmed myself down a little and called the cops. They came and drove me around trying to find a car like the one the guy was driving cause i dont really know anything about cars and couldnt tell them anything besides the color. I found one like it and they brought me to my moms work and let her calm me further before bringing me to the station to give a report. They told me that their is no guarantee that he wasn't stalking me and they didnt want to give me a false sense of security. So i am staying at my moms house for a few days to try and recover from the experience. I have walked all over plattsburgh in the middle of the night before and seemed to think I was invincible until now..... It was scary and really made me appreciate life a lot more. All i thought about when i was running was that he was going to shoot me or something and I would never see my family again. I have a very loving family whom I am very close to. So I have come to learn that not even little old Plattsburgh, NY, is safe to walk around at night by yourself anymore, who would of thought it. Pretty fucked up world its become. So a hint to anyone who reads this:
DO NOT WALK ALONE AT NIGHT
ALWAYS CARRY A CELL PHONE
YOU CAN PICK UP PEPPER SPRAY AT ANY HARDWARE STORE
HAVE A BOLT-LOCK INSTALLED ON YOUR DOOR
DO NOT TALK TO STRANGERS
NEVER ACCEPT A RIDE FROM A STRANGER

In Better News:
I have a cute new apartment on Miller St in Plattsburgh. Although right now I am afraid of it because of the above incident. I am still very proud of it. I worked hard for it and have fully enjoyed the benefit of my own little place. Anyways, things in my life are going good. I have a great job and am enjoying life. 

Friend News:
I have also recently begun a fresh attempt at a very treasured friendship with someone in college. It was smashed by someone else whom I won't mention but deserves nothing more than a good beating...lol. Anyways my treasured friends name is brooke and she is getting married soon to a wonderful girl named codi. They are a match made in heaven, and I always knew they were destined to be together. I cannot wait for the wedding, it will be a wonderful day, full of life-long memories. I have also taken a good look at current friends and have started (in other words) ""cleaning my address book"" I have realized many things about some ""current"" friends and am realizing their true intentions. I am a much stronger person that I was even 6 months ago and will never let ""those"" people bring me down again. I spent so much time blaming myself that I didnt realize ""IT WASNT MY FAULT"" I am moving on to bigger and better things, and will never let a ""friend"" bring me down again. YAY!! Finally huh........

Mental Health Update:
Well, I have really nothing to say in this category except that my self-harm is non-existent. I havent self-harmed in many many many months!!!! GO ME!!

Well, thats all I have for now. I will write more again when I get the chance.

I work at Emergency First Aid and I work with Jimmy (fun huh!!) He is obsessed a little. He still loves me alot but I don.t know how I feel. My whole family hates him, especially my mom. It's a very confusing situation. Life is going ok I guess right now. I have a very cute kitten named Squeakers and he keeps me very busy. I love my new job and am saving up for a car.

"event","Me and Jimmy have been living together for a few months now. It has been going ok. I have overcome my awkward feelings toward him because of the EMT thing. I know he loves me even though I am a cutter. I also know that he would never turn me in or get me into trouble for what I do. He trusts me. He also doesn't try and take care of me too, which is good, cause if he did, we would probably not still be together. 

Today has been a boring day. I have been here by myself mostly. I have also been very depressed all day and have been wanting to hurt myself. I am trying to hold back the urges but they are getting stronger and stronger. I am getting so frustrated with them. I am not in Breakthrough anymore. I moved out to move in with Jimmy. I still attend the Center on Tuesday's and Friday's though. They are having the bus pick me up and bring me home now, cause I have not been going to the Center very much anymore. They have not had the self-harm class in many weeks. That is getting so frustrating. If they don't have the class this week, then I am leaving the Center. That class is the reason why I go in the first place. I applied at Wal-Mart cause I am going crazy without a job. I hope I get it. I want to have money to buy presents for everyone for Christmas. Anyways, my tummy hurts so it's nappy time. Write more again sometime. Ciao."

We have not even slept together. I feel so awkward cause he is an EMT. It's wierd cause I am a cutter. He knows but what if he sees and try to care for them or something. I don't know what to do.

This is going to be so hard to hide but I am sooo afraid they will put me in the hospital or something. I cannot wait for the day to be over and go back to the house and call my friends and get out of here for a little while. At least with them I will feel safe that they won't say anything if they find out. Anyways, I am going to find some drugs today. I am so exited. I cannot wait to get stoned. I need and deserve it. I have been working so hard lately and have been getting so frustrated. Ugh!! Maybe I do need drug rehab, lol. I don't care, I'm not ready to stop yet. I love getting high.

Things have been going ok. I am at the day program right now. I tried to check my e-mail but got blocked, lol. I had a break down last night. I came back from my day pass and got a big surprise, a roommate!! I freaked out, she snores and is very messy, ugh!! I tried to get a ride to my house but with no luck. I ended up getting maybe an hour of sleep and am very exhausted. I talked to her this morning and she is normal and fun to talk to. She apologized for keeping me up all night as well. Right now, all I want to do is, go back to the house and go to sleep. I am soooo tired. The day program is ok. I cannot wait to get out of orientation, and to get out of that house. I still have a few more weeks there but hopefully soon I can get into the apartment program and get my own apartment. It will be sooo great. I will be able to save up money and eventually get an apartment that I pay for. Cause the apartment program is covered through medicaid, like Breakthrough is. I won't have any bills. Every bit of money I make working will be put into a savings account, except for food, supplies and cigs. It will be nice not to have to worry about bills yet. I am confident this program will help me get on my feet, you just have to work towards it, that's all. They will even help me find a good job, not just Labor Ready shit, ugh!! This program is slow going but hopefully I will get everything I need from it. 

Updates on Mental Health:
I have not cut in a while now. I am going crazy. I feel like I am spinning all the time. It sucks so bad. Everything seems out of control. I am working so hard to stop and it is sooo hard to do. I don't feel in control when I don't cut, but then I feel out of control when I do. Especially when I have not done it in a while or I do it out of anger or hatred for myself. It is all so fucked up. But I am working hard to get better. 

Anyways, I hope that's enough updates for now. Exhaustion is making it hard for me to type. I'll keep you all posted, even though I don't think anyone reads this anymore. But it's ok, I'll still keep it updated as much as I can. Ciao."

"event","I got discharged from the Mental Health Unit yesterday. I had been there since the 19th of August. I got help. It sucked so bad in there but I really needed help. I cannot believe they even discharged me. Cause just Monday I got strapped to a bed and got injections to calm down, because I didn't get my privileges back so I freaked out and ran off the Unit. I couldn't smoke without privileges and cigarettes are an important part of my self-harm, so I freaked. I got tied down for an hour. I calmed down really fast, when they strapped me down. It sucked so badly. I had such an itch on my nose, lol. I know it's not funny but I have to make some humor out of it or I'll go crazy thinking about it. Anyways I am better now. I am loads of meds tho. They like me drugged up apparently. I am on:
Cymbalta
Risperdol
Benadryl
Buspar 
Cogentin
and Aloe Vista ointment for my scars. 
The Cogentin is due to an allergic reaction to Haldol. My body goes into convulsions and seizures and my heart races and I get pale and weak and sweaty and shaky and it's horrible. That happened yesterday and I had to get rushed to the ER. I called 911 on myself. It was so bad. I almost died. I am supposed to be resting, lol. But I have too much energy now that I am out of there to rest. All I remember is calling someone and then I was found on my floor. A really cute guy was brushing my massaging my hair and holding my hand. It was so scary. 
Anyways, wanted to fill everyone in. I am gonna go do something else now, I am bored with typing. Write more later prolly. Ciao."

My friend Brittany ended up selling some of the Zyprexa for me and is getting me two hydro 10/500, they are blue and are the best for me so far. It does not take many of them to get me high which is good cause it saves me money. The person she is getting them from is selling them for $5, which is a pretty good deal, since they usually are about $10 each. I am so excited because I have hydro's tonight and I will have more tomorrow, tee hee hee, life is good. I also just talked to Codi. She is so sweet, I miss her and Brooke so much. I cannot wait til school starts so I will be able to see them more often. It will be so much fun to hang out with them again. It's been so lonely.

In other news:
I went to my cousin's farewell party today. It was a lot of fun. I got to really get to know him. I spent a lot of time with him, talking and screwing around. He kept throwing me in the pool and trying to knock me over cause I was doing Jell-O shots. Me and my sister were racing to see who could eat them the fastest and we went through like 12 of them each if not more and they were pretty strong. And I am such a light-weight so I had a pretty good buzz going. My sis was pissed cause she was barely buzzing and it went away after a little while. Mine lasted for quite a while, tee hee hee. Apparently Nick (my cousin) is a medic in the army, but we don't know if he is going to be a field medic and be in the line of fire or be a base medic and be more safe. It's scary and I am keeping my fingers crossed. He is one of those guys that have a good heart and we all know that's rare these days. He is a good kid and I just know he will be fine. He will be there for 18 months which is going to very hard on his family. Me and my mom are going to send him stuff while he is in Iraq. I want to send him a playboy, lol (my family has a fucked up sense of humor) but apparently I can't send it cause the Army won't allow shit like that to be sent, lol. I am probably just freaking out cause I know he will come back safely. I should just chill and be happy that he is doing something he wants to and soemthing he is proud of. I am very proud of him, he is very brave in my eyes and I am glad to have a cousin like him. He will go far in life.

In other other news:
I have not cut in over a day. I am on my way to stopping. Me and Katie and Anthony have all come to an understanding (I hope) and I am sure they will not hurt me again while I start on my road to recovery again. I know I can do it. If my cousin can risk his life to serve his country then I know I can stop cutting. Pray for me and my cousin and the rest of the troops. Ciao."

"event","I am going to join a circus!! for real!! A friend of mine has left home to join a circus and she makes over $100 a night!! She invited me to join because two girls just quit and shit. They also have a lot of drugs there, which is totally awesome. I am so exited. I get to get stoned every night and make tons of money. A lot more then I would make working at Wal-Mart or Big M. Tee hee hee. They have bunks available and everything. My friend Katie might take a break from college to join me. It is going to be totally awesome, I am so exited. Right now they are in New Jersey. They travel all over the US, which is cool too because I get to see all sorts of states and shit. It is going to be so much fun. We broke the news to our parents tonight. My mom flipped out and said I was dumb, lol. Katie's mom was like ""you know how I feel about it."" I don't really think she took Katie seriously at all. I think it's a great idea. It will let me travel and save money at the same time. It wil be so much fun. It will be a great new experience and I defintely think it's worth a try. After all, if we don't like it, we can always come back, so I am not worried about it at all. What are everyone else's opinions about it, should I go? Anyways, me and Katie got into an argument again. This time, she hurt me bad. She ignored me the whole night because she wanted to hang out with my brother instead. I even asked her several times to hang out with me and shit and she said she'd be there in a minute but she never came. And then the second time I came in they were both sleeping. Then I went in a third time to wake her up to make sure she got home in time for work and they were having sex, GROSS!! I will be traumatized for life. Anyways, the reason I got so angry is because he is just using her and shit, and I do not want to see her get hurt and I have told her a hundred times that he is using her and so hasn't our other friend Keisha, whom is also my best friend. Well, I am truly trying to stop cutting. It is something I really want, and both Keisha and Katie are supporting me in this adventure and promised to keep all drama out of my life til I am stable again. And of course this has caused me a ton of drama in my life at the moment and it's an ongiong thing. This has happened before and she promised it would not happen again, but it did. I was seriously considering not being her friend anymore but she is so important to me and I would be even more hurt to not have her in my life. So either way I am fucked really bad. We talked for over an hour and she says definitely she would not let this happen again and I think she finally understands that he is using her. So I am hoping that she keeps her promise because for once I am thinking of myself first and I WILL keep all drama out of my life. I want to get better, and I will do anything to achieve that.

In other news:
The Katie and Anthony (brother) incident caused me to cut. I was so overwhelmed that she did that after she promised she wouldn't let him use her, that I caved. This is a huge set-back in my recovery. I am deeply wounded by this event and the fact that I cut when it had been a while. Obviously, Katie and Keisha do not know this. If Katie found out, it would destroy her and I would never do that to a friend. I have them convinced that for once ""the cat scratched me."" It's an old excuse but one that I have not used in years after everyone found out the truth. I am saddened that my best friend has done this to me AGAIN!! but I guess I am a sucker for punishment because she means so much to me and I would be devestated if something as stupid as that came between us.

In other other news:
My cousin Eric is getting sent over to Iraq. I am very upset by this news as well and worried. I wish Bush would grow the fuck up and get our troops out of that fucking country. If they wanna kill eachother, fucking let them, who cares? We are having a good-bye and be safe party for him tomorrow before he ships out. Keep all your fingers crossed for me that he comes back ok. Also, pray for all the other troops over there as well. We love them all and want them all to come home safely."

We are still friends, but I am still very upset with her for what she did. I know I should forgive and forget but what she lied about is totally fucked up. Anyways, I went to the ER about a week and a half ago for my toe because it hurt and it was infected and shit (I got hydro's!!), and they sent me to see a specialist. Apparently I had an infected ingrown toenail, so the doctor removed my whole toenail on my left big toe. It hurt like a bitch. I cried so hard when he put the needle in to numb up my toe, ick!! When he finished removing the toe he bandaged it up and gave me instructions on how to care for it til it heals and shit. I have to take antibiotics and soak my toe twice a day for thirty minutes in Epsom Salt (which hurts so much!!). Anyways, he told me to take tylenol or motrin for the pain, HAHAHA, yeah right!! I get home after me and my mom got the things on the list to care for it and I started taking the bandage off and shit and it hurt like a bitch, and when I put it in the Epsom salt I nearly passed out. It was the worse pain in my life. I called the doctors office after being in pain for over an hour to tell him the motrin and tylenol junk he told me to take wasn't working and it hurt so much, and get this, the office was closed. So I called my regular doctor's office, and the doctor there said she was shocked that they didn't give me anything for pain except motrin and tylenol. So she prescribed me hydrocodone, hehe. The worst part was I couldn't even snort them and enjoy them because I actually had to take them. I mean, by the time I didn't need them for pain I only had 4 left to have fun with, ick!! At least I got to have fun with the ones from the hospital, hehe. Anyways, it has been 4 days since the surgery and my toe looks worse then ever. It is pure white and bruised beyond belief, but at least it doesn't hurt like hell. Anyways, I am exhausted and I think my blankets are dry now, write more another time, Ciao."

Which is odd because they said they would hire me and gave me a 45 minute tour of the place and showed me how things were done. I am upset by this news. To deal with it, I am getting high!! How I love Oxycodone. Anyways, I am chatting with Ryan via AIM right now and snorting a line every 5 minutes, lol. Life is good. I try not to let stupid things annoy me anymore. Hey, you only live once right? Well, my day has been ok. I got up early and went to Plattsburgh with my mom. It was fun, I love MOMMY TIME!! Anyways, I gotta find some naughty pics of me for Ryan, he is a pervert, lol. Write in ya tomorrow, ciao."

Me, Katie and Keisha have been spending a lot of time together, hanging out and getting stoned. I am getting really deep into drugs. I guess that's to be expected with me stopping cutting. I had to pick up something else...I guess. Anyways, it's all good. I am enjoying it. I am trying hard to think of more detailed updates, but I am so fucked up, its crazy. My nose is running like crazy, Geesh.... Anyways, my mom got a really good job at the Post Office. I am so proud of her. She makes over $14/hr. Which is great for her, now she will have more money to spend on herself, she deserves to spoil herself everyday, lol. I cannot wait to start my job, it is going to be so much hanging out with animals all day...I am so exited. I deserve a good job, I have been working shit jobs all my life. 

In other news:
I have lost some weight. A good amount too. I think it's all the coke I have been doing and the exercising and shit. I am so proud of myself. I still want to lose more. Ryan keeps telling me that I look great the way I am now, but I am doing it for me....he understands. Bascially, my life has been, work, do drugs and get drunk. Which is great, lol. Anyways, I am really fucked up and cannot concentrate for a second longer. I will try to update more frequently. Ciao."

"event","well.....a lot has happened since the last time I wrote. The physical pain from the abortion is gone, but the emotional pain will never go away. I still cry all the time and hate myself for the decision I made. My mom knows about it now. She helps a lot by reassuring me that time will eventually make the pain go away. She tells me that it's ok to feel angry and betrayed and that it is ok to cry. She is good shit.

I am a Clinton Community College graduate now. I graduated on May, 19th (my 21st birthday). It was a lot of fun. My mom threw a huge party and a lot of people came. Katie and Keisha even came. We got really drunk and ate tons of yummy food. Katie even brought me pills, so I got really high. Hells Yeah. My cousin Nick brought us to the liquor store and I bought my first bottle of liquor (Jack Daniels), I also bought vodka for Katie. Good Times. I love being 21. We partied for hours, dancing and drinking and chatting, the time flew by so fast. By like 2am it was raining really hard outside and most of the guests had left so we all went inside to warm up and dry off. When we got inside, me and my sister spent an hour in the bathroom throwing up due to drinking way too much, lol. She ended up passing out but after puking three times, I was thirsty for more. So I joined back in the festivities and found out my mom took several pictures of us puking, lol. (If anyone wants a copy, let me know, tee hee hee) My mom hung out with Katie and Keisha a lot and seemed to really enjoy their company. They were calling all of Keisha's friends and my mom was pretending to be a hot college student, lol. We ate birthday cake, played darts, and drank some more. By 4:30am, we were exhausted and finally passed the fuck out, all still wearing our clothes and me still in my graduation outfit. 

The next day, we woke up really late. Ate some left over food and Katie and Keisha went home. Later in the day, my mom brought me and my sister to Wal-Mart to buy and outfit to go out in. I bought and adorable little shirt and skirt, with a long-sleeved top. We went back to the dorms to get dressed while my mom went and got Dale (our DD). We arrived at Tabu and went straight to the bar. I ordered two Kamakazi's for me, a Long-Island Ice Tea for my mom, and a Smirnoff for my sister. We drank and danced the night away. The booze eventually caught up with me and I went to the bathroom where I passed out on the toilet. My mom and another woman picked me up, hosed me off and kept me standing before someone saw, or they would have kicked me out. We went back downstairs and kept dancing. I danced with two different hot guys and had a blast. Then we brought them home. There names were Chad and Joe. Chad was hot and all mine. I got some hot sex when we got back after my parents had passed out. It was weird with my parents in the next room, but hey, I was wasted. We then feel asleep with our arms around eachother, it was wonderful. I woke up an hour later and rushed to the bathroom. I puked and began a horrible two days recovering from alcohol poisoning. Apparently, I drank way too much, lol. Before Chad left though, he kissed me on my forehead and gave me his number, he is good shit. 

My recovery was rough but I made it. Last night, I got to spend it with my bestest friend in the whole world, Katie. She came and picked me up, Lacy was even with her, and we went back to her house in Ausable. We got drunk and hung out. When Lacy went to bed, we got bored and went for a walk. We turned it into a mission to find an open place and a cold drink. We found a bar, go figure. We went in, and I ordered a soda and a kamakazi shot (I never learn). We drank and chilled out until it closed. I was still thirsty so we went on our mission to find a drink. We found a soda machine but it didn't work. So we gave up and started walking back to her house. I  spotted a soda machine and it worked!! I love mountain Dew. So our mission was a success. We went back to her house and cooked pizza and watched a movie. Then at 4:30am, it was time for bed. We went to sleep and woke up around 2pm the next day and got ready to come back here. She is taking me to the dorms later so I can get my stuff. I was going to live there over the summer because I am taking a summer class, but I would rather live with my dad for $200 a month then pay $500 a month to live in the dorms. At least at my dad's, I get free laundry and food. So now, I am waiting for Katie to call me so we can head out. 

That's all for now. Write more again soon."

I had to take this pill that causes my ovaries to contract so that it can release the excess blood. It's like having contractions so I have been in alot of pain. The best part about today is that he perscribed me hydrocodone. Hells Yeah. Once my pain goes away I have a feeling tonight is going to be tons of fun.....Ciao."

"event","I am drunk and I am high.....I am happy. I am hanging out with Brooke, Keisha, Frenchie and Katie. We are all having so much fun. My mommy came today and loaded me up with money. It was pity money and it made me feel even worse. So I spent some of it on drugs, which made me feel better. I also saved some for laundry so I will have clean clothes. She also got me some oatmeal cream pie thingy's and some soup and a hot chocolate from Dunkin Donuts. And the best part of all, I got a big hug. I miss her so much and I want to spend some time with her so badly. I am going home this weekend because she has the whole weekend off, and we are going to spend some quality time. I told her why I have been so upset lately and so depressed. She was not mad at all that I had the abortion, she was just upset because I had to do it alone. She wished she could have been there for me. I wished she could have been there also. It was all so depressing. I cried on the phone with her for over an hour, and she just listened to every mean thing I said about myself. I am hurt and will be hurt for awhile, but now I don't have to be hurting alone. I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I feel like I can heal from this horrible ordeal. I am excited about this weekend, I cannot wait to spend some quality time with my mommy. I have an appt. tomorrow, it's my check-up to make sure there is no infection and since I am doing it at my doctor, I am going to complain about my back so I can get some pills. I also want to discuss my depression and insomnia with them and see if there is anything that they could do for me. If I wasn't so sad and if I could actually sleep, I might feel better about myself. I am going to see if my mommy will take me job hunting when she picks me up on Friday. I really want to get a job so badly. I miss Wal-Mart and want to try and see if they will let me back, but I don't have any transportation, so it would not work out. My friend Brooke is selling me her Ford Focus, I am so excited about that also. I have wanted the same car for years, ever since it came out. I let my mom know and I think they might take out a loan for me, so I can buy it from her, it will be so great. I love parents. I told her that it's what I have wanted for so long. She might have my step-dad take out a loan for me, which is great. Now, all I need to do is get my license. I am going to go sign up for my 5-hour course too. And my mom is letting me take my driving test in her car. Hopefully, I will be driving soon and not have to ask people for rides anymore. This is going to be great, now I have to really find a job and get this plan in motion. If this works out, I will be happiest girl in the world and after all I have been through, I deserve it so much."

I have not even done my homework in so long. I am so far behind, I do not know what I am going to do. I have an F in Biology right now and my other grades are not any better right now too. If I do not pass, my mom is going to kill me (not literally) Anyways, I need some major help here. I think I am going to talk to my doctor tomorrow. I know I don't have any insurance but I really need some help on this. Maybe he could help me get back on a schedule, cause my clock is all fucked up and I cannot seem to change it. I cannot sleep at night at all. I lay in bed for hours and as soon as the sun rises, I fall asleep. Then I wake up at like 4pm and still feel like I have not slept in days. It is so weird. I also have no energy to do anything. I feel like I am like 400 lbs. It feels so heavy to walk and I get so tired and drained for doing like a half hour of homework. If I do not change these behaviors I will never pass college and I will NEVER graduate. I want it more than anything, I just cannot get motivated. I cannot get interested in studying. All I want to do is sleep, it's all I can do. My Aunt bought me like $50 in food and I still have most of it. I barely eat. I rarely go to class and I rarely do homework. I am falling apart from the inside out. Right now I am yawning and wanting so badly to get working on my homework like I said I was going to, but I just cannot get the energy to do it. I also have to do laundry because I have no clean clothes but I cannot seem to get going on that either. Grrrrr..... I don't know what to do, I don't know how to make this better.........."

"event","Well....I am not a mommy anymore. I made my decision today because the doctor said he could do the procedure this morning if I wanted it done. It was spontaneous. I wasn't planning on doing it, but I had an opportunity so I took it. It was horrible. I feel so ashamed and lost. I have been in severe pain all day. The doctor said it was normal. I was supposed to get some pain pills, antibiotics to prevent infection and blood-clotting pills but my women's insurance doesn't cover medications and I didn't have any money. I know I should be taking them but I didn't want anything to carry back with me cause I tricked my mom into taking me in the first place because I had no other way there and I didn't have anything to carry it in. I feel so ashamed. I keep telling myself that it needed to be done but I still feel horrible. I guess that is how I am supposed to feel. And the doctor said I would be in a lot of pain and I would bleed heavily for a week or two. He also said I would not only hurt physically but also emotionally. The thing that sucks most about it all is that I had to do it all by myself. My own cousin went with her boyfriend whom she has known for like three weeks over me. I feel horrible. My friend Brooke said she would have taken me and gone in with me and everything but I found that out afterwards. I was going to ask her, but I don't like asking people for things at all and she had class too and I didn't want her to miss any classes. And I didn't really want anyone to be there with me until after I was already there and then I wished I would have had someone come with me. It was so awful. They tried to give me the pill but after I took it they told me what I would be experiencing and I told them ""no"". The pill basically cuts off the oxygen and food supply to the baby. And when it dies they give you another pill to stimulate contractions to expel the baby and then you flush it. How fucked up is that. It can also be even more painful and it could last for over a week. Then I started reconsidering but the doctor told me it was too late already because I had taken the pill and the baby might already be dead because a lot of time has passed. He checked the baby's heart beat and there was none. I broke down completely. The nurse talked with me for like an hour and held my hand and shit. She was so sweet. Then I agreed to finish the normal abortion procedure where they scrape the baby out of you. Usually they terminate the babies life before they scrape but it was already dead in this case. So they scraped it out (which was very uncomfortable even with the anesthesia.) I will never do that again. I cannot believe I just killed a human being just because I did not want to ruin my graduation party by being pregnant. There were other reasons as well like my mom being ashamed and my young adult life being ruined. But it is still no excuse. I am such an awful person. I know these feelings are normal and that I will eventually get over them but I still feel so bad and I will never forget this selfish act. I hate myself........enough said."

"event","I am still sick......this cold is kicking my ass. A friend of mine traded me some cold medicine for half a hydrocodone and 2 flexeril's, so that made me happy. I didn't have any money so she said she would give me 2 of the cold medicine pills for half a hydrocodone and 2 flexeril, so it was a good deal, and I didn't want to feel like I was taking advantage of her. I just took them so they should knock me out soon, so this isn't going to be long. Anyways, I have not went job hunting yet, because I have been sick but I have been helping my Aunt clean so I could get some money. It's only temporary though so I need to find something more permanent. I will be applying at Pizza Hut, Dunkin Donuts, and Yando's, so hopefully, one of them will be hiring. I need to find a job closer so I can take the bus there. Vesid is going to be sending me a check soon so I can pay for a bus pass, which is awesome. I usually get $30 every two weeks, which helps out a lot. Me, Katie and Chantel hung out tonight and we ordered pizza....good times...it would have been better though if I had been feeling better. 

damn....I just pulled my hand away from the keyboard for a sec and heard a loud pop....it hurt like a bitch. I think I broke my damn finger...I am falling apart man...it was funny as hell though...I think I spontaneously combusted...lol....damn I need to sleep......

Anyways, I am getting my huge paycheck on Thursday and me, Katie and Chantel are going to the reservation in Altona and then we are going shopping after my class. It is going to be much fun. I am treating them out to Little Caesar's too...good times... 

Mental Health Update:
I am ok. I ahve not cut in a while and I seem to be more calm and relaxed, which is great. I have not had a nightmare in days and the flashbacks are gone too. I think I am healing now, which is good. My arms are also starting to heal again, even though I will never be able wear a short-sleeved shirt in public again. Other than that, things are fine. I am upset that I have done that to myself but I guess I am glad because if it wasn't for the cutting I know I would have been dead a long time ago. IT kind of feels like the cutting has given me a second chance and the scars will always remind me of the obstacles I have overcome in my life.

Anyways, enough mushy stuff....I am exhausted....write in you again soon.....ciao."

"event","Everything has been ok these past couple of days. I am getting more sleep, and me and chantel are eating right again. The only thing is.....I got sick.....just a head cold though......hopefully it does not get any worse. I can tell I am running a fever right now and my nose is all blocked up and my eyes are watering. ugh.. My cousin got her DVD player and she is bringing it to me when she comes back in a little while. My DVD player broke a couple weeks ago and I have been trying to watch Bruce Almighty for ages. She is also bringing me McDonald's...I am sick and not really in the mood for it but I guess I should eat something to keep my strength up. damn.....I just sneezed....lol. Anyways, I have been looking for another job......and keeping up with my homework........cause I have an F in Biology right now, so I have been trying to raise my grade. My mommy let me borrow $20 from her 2 days ago so I could get food, soda, cups and tissues. YAY for mommy!! We got a bunch of junk food and soda and we messed around in Wal-Mart....it was fun...... Anyways, I have been just chilling out and doing nothing except cleaning my room, playing on my computer and doing my homework. SO my life has been pretty boring..

Mental Health Updates:
I have been ok and mostly calm. Only a few minor panic attacks and a nightmare a few days ago but other than that things have been ok. I have had many urges to self-harm but I am holding strong. I slipped yesterday and scratched my arm with a safety pin, but other than that, I have not cut in a few days now. Go Me!! Anyways, I am working on it and am going to see my school counselor on Monday. I am also going to go to DSS on Monday and tell them that I need medical insurance because I need to get back into counseling right away. Hopefully, they will help me work something out.  

Enough chit-chat for me, I am going to do some more homework now....until next time.....ciao."

"event","Well today has been an interesting day....

I woke up at around 2pm hearing Chantel and Dustin talk about having sex in the bed next to me...ugh...They said they were kidding so I didn't scream at them for long. I went out for a smoke and we began deciding how tonight would go since we have a plan to get a couple hundred dollars...and NO it's not illegal. So we came up with a plan and then just lounged around until 3:30pm when we all took turns taking a shower. We got ready and headed over to the dining hall where we all mounds of burgers, hot dogs and fries to make up for the last couple of days when we have not had much food. Then we came back and set the plan into motion (well the plan to start the actual plan). We made some phone calls and then went out for a smoke and found out we had a mandatory meeting in the dining hall. Dustin left to get the plan going and me and Chantel went to the meeting. The RD talked about the damage being done to the building and she told us it was over $3,000. She also said that the money was coming out of our security deposits and if it costs more then everyone will be billed. It's pretty fucked up. So we argued with the RA outside for a little while and came back to the dorms to find a ride to my Aunt's house so we can check on her kids for her because a 16 year old is watching them and she does not trust him very well. now we are waiting for the cab to get here so we can do that for my Aunt. What a fun day...and it will be even more fun if we can get that couple hundred dollars.....yippeeeee....."

Updates:
I am working at Wal-Mart......ugh.......It sucks but it's a job. I am taking 3 online classes and one regular one on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4:15. I have several new friends (Katie, Lacy, Jenna, Dustin, Chris, Keisha, Derek, and Cuba) Things are going good at the moment. Me and Katie went and got my paycheck, then cashed it and came back to the dorms to get Rhombie so we could get some alcohol. We ended up getting stuck in the parking lot right in front of the liquor store. This random guy hopped in the car and steered while me, Katie and Rhombie pushed, it was fun. I fell in the snow and got soaked.....good times.... SO we came back and now I am doing laundry while she finishes her homework, then we are drinking....getting high....and having fun.......more good times..... Now I am trying to get some perks from a friend and chatting with my friend Jenna. I got some....blew some with Brooke.....Now it's time to drink with Keisha......hells yeah!!

Mental Health Updates:
I have not cut in almost 2 days now and the major one I did a week or so ago is healing up nicely (thanks butterfly stitches). I am starting to become happier and more content with my life, now that I am so busy all the time. It's hard on my body but my mind is liking it. I have been having less nightmares and the flashbacks and anxiety attacks are slowly getting better. I think I may actually be healing. Go Me!!"

"event","Last night was great. I sold my book so I used the money to go shopping at Wal-Mart. I had kept the rest of Jamie's alcohol so I decided to get a bunch of drinks to mix it with. So I bought a ton of mixers and plastic cups and me and Chantel came back here. She made Jell-o shots while I divided the last of the alcohol into 13 cups. 6 had Blackberry Schnapps and 7 had Vodka. I mixed all the vodka with another drink, 3 had V-8 juice, 1 had OJ and the other 2 had Orange Soda (it was good). Then we cleaned my room a little, and spread the word by mouth. A few peeps came and J.J. the security guard was sneaking in alcohol as well. Then I got an IM from Brooke. She wanted to know if I wanted to hang out. I was a little nervous as to what she would do to me, but for Trish's sake and to keep peace, I went. We got there and just chatted about our vacations and shit. Then Brooke and I did a Hydro. I told her about the alcohol in my room, so we all decided to go back to my room to do a couple of shots. When we got back to my room, J.J. had brought a crap load of peeps with him. So we all did shots and hung out and shit. By like 3:30am, everyone wanted Jell-o shots and did not care if they were done or not. So I grabbed a spoon and dug spoonfuls out from the bowl we had it in and I began handing them out. Everyone said they were great Jell-o shots and did not seem to care that were not yet solid. So we all hung out and chatted. Brooke ran and got everyone's marker and we were all drawing shit on my walls, it was a lot of fun. I gave J.J. $6 to help pay for gas so he could get us some alcohol, but he never got anymore. So by like 4am, everyone was bored. Me, Katie, Brooke, Chantel, Jamie, Courtney, J.J., Katie's roommate, and some kid with blue hair all went out for a smoke. I believe there were others but those are people that I remember. I was the last one so they all went in the lounge except Chantel cause she went back to my room. I forgot my key of course so I was stuck outside until someone let me in. When I got to the lounge, everyone had a soda. Apparently they had flipped the machine and gotten free sodas out of it. They then decided to do the same to the candy machine. SO they all flipped the candy machine and they got tons of food out of it. LMAO!! SO they picked it all up and we went back to my room. I took the M&M's from Jamie and started trying to throw them up in the air and make it in my mouth. Which gave everyone else the idea to throw it at me to see if I would catch it? Well, I was doing fine with 2-3 people throwing them, but then everyone started throwing them, which I believe was there plan, I kept getting whacked with M&M's and I gave up, lol. So then we got this even brighter idea of launching Brooke off of a huge snow jump with her skis on. We were going to hook her to the back of a car and launch her off the huge pile of snow in the parking lot, but no one had a car. Apparently she is doing that with Megan tomorrow, so I hope she lets me know when cause everyone said they would watch her. We played music some more, chatted, annoyed my suitemates, and smoked tons of cigs. And by 5:15am, Brooke had passed out on my bed. I covered her up and locked her in my room while I smoked a cig, so no one would do evil shit to her while she was passed out. Katie came back before me and tried to wake her up but she would not budge. SO we left her there and I began picking up my room. She woke up on her own a few minutes later, and we watched Katie and the blue-haired kid run down the hall smoking a bowl, lmao. So then me and Brooke spent a few minutes wiping our fingerprints off of the markers and throwing them down the hall. By 5:30am, everyone was bored and we were all starting to sober up, so we all went out for one more smoke then split back to our rooms. But before we left, we all said we had a great time and that we should do it again very soon. It was all awesome, I could not have asked for a better night. 

One more thing, I got to snort Cocaine. I cant say from who, but I actually got to try it. It was fucking awesome, as soon as I get money I am buying a $20 bag."

"event","Last night was an ok night. I slept from 10:30pm until like 12:30pm, I guess I was pretty tired. I woke up, had some cereal, went out for a smoke, watched some TV, then started getting ready for class. I had to run out the door because I almost missed the bus, hehe. Now I am sitting at the college chatting with Jamie and Trish. He got drunk last night and slept for over 12 hours like I did, lol, but I didn't get drunk, I was just extremely tired. I am going grocery shopping with Trish tonight, it's going to be great. I love food, lol. I am also going to visit my cousin in the hospital after because she had her baby finally. He is a boy, I don't know the weight yet, but I will find out when I get there. Apparently, he is really cute. Looks like today is going to be a good day. Except for the amount of homework I will have to do, some kid in my class said that he had this professor last semester and she likes to give lots of homework, oh well, I guess. My mom told me last night that she is spending over $2000 on my graduation party, hehe. And she finally changed her mind and said that I could invite my friends to it. She is getting me a keg for them, YAY!! It is going to be so much fun, I cannot wait for the party. Well, class is starting soon, Ciao."

My cousin finally got induced, so she should be having her baby tonight, she is only 15, which is the norm to have a child in my family (pretty fucked up). I finished all the stuff for my online classes tonight and found out that I am not behind on anything, which is good. Then me and Trish just hung out. She left for her friend Jenna's house and now I am going to bed.....me so sleepy.........zzzzzzzzzzzzzz"

"event","At 8pm:
Jamie still loves me, YAY!! We spent some quality time together tonight. We snorted some hydro's and then just chilled and chatted about our vacations. Jamie was in NYC so even if I did have his screen name, I would not have been able talk to him because he was not around a computer all vacation. I had been feeling bad because I did not talk to him all vacation, but he said it was fine and he said that he thought about me all the time and that he missed me very much. YAY!! 


Everything After 8pm:
Me and Jamie spent some ""quality time"" together after Trish got back from her house. We went up to his room and drank some blackberry schnapps. Then Trish left cause I told Jamie we would have a quickie while she was in the bathroom and she heard it, lol. So when she got out of the bathroom she said she was leaving so we could ""boink"", lol. So we had damn fun sex then came back and went up to Keisha's Room and drank a beer. Then we hung out for awhile and smoked cigarette after cigarette. Then Damon came back and we hung for a little while, then smoked a bowl in a bathroom upstairs. It was fun yet hazy........ Then we came back to my room and chilled and I took pictures with my web cam. SO basically, we all had a really good night. Now it's cigarette time again, then we all pass out like drunken people usually do ......."

So now I am finishing up my packing and getting really excited about moving in today, I am going when my mom goes to work hopefully. I am going to put all of my things in the car while they are getting ready, so I can be back at the dorms by like 9am. That way I can have my things moved in and sitauted by like 11 am, so I can take a nap and then get up and do my online classes. I haven't even logged into them yet, hopefully, they don't think that I am not going to do it. I cannot wait to be back there, its movie downloading time!! I am hoping to buy a DVD burner as soon as I get the money put away, so I can burn them and then delete them, so I can download more, yay!! It's going to be fun doing that, lol. Anyways, I don't know if I typed this yet or not but I got contacts and new glasses!! YAY, I am very excited and cannot wait to show them off.

"event","I stayed up all night because I could not get to sleep. I took a shower around 7am when everyone else in my house was getting ready to leave. Me, my mother, and my step-father left around 7:30am and set off for my mom's work as she had to be there by 8am. Then when we dropped her off, we went straight to Wal-Mart and I filled out the application and then went to see Ron in Personnel. He had me fill out some more paperwork and then told me to come back tomorrow to be drug tested and to have my interview with a CSM. I really do hope I pass my drug test. I have drank a lot of water. And it has also been about a month since I smoked, so I should pass. Then we stopped to the college and I got everything squared away with the dorms. I just paid for a single room, it was less hassle that way. Then I changed my schedule around to fit my work hours and had that put into the system. After that, I headed to the bookstore to get my books and some supplies for classes and then stopped at the Nurse to get the paper for my TB test. When we left the college we went to my doctor's office to get my TB test done and then came back home. Believe or not, all of this took over 4 hours to do. My dad did not seem to happy about it, but he didn't complain. When I got back home I talked to my sister about tomorrow's events. She wants me to go to her appointment with her so that she is not alone. And after that I am going to see if she can drop me off at Wal-Mart for my interview and drug test. I will just take the bus where I need to go and if I have to stay at my father's house until my mom gets done work then I will do that. So that is pretty much all planned out. The when I got off the phone with her, I hopped into bed and took a little nap. I woke at around 9:30pm, when my mom got home from work. I helped her with groceries and we had dinner. (They had brought home Wendy's) Then we started planning ny huge graduation party. We compiled somewhat of a list of friends and family and decided that since my graduation falls on a Thursday, we wont have the party until Friday. So I guess we will have the graduation on Thursday followed by a little party after the commencement(just close family members). Then we will have the huge party on Friday starting at 2pm. We will tons of food, a DJ, a bathtub full of ice and beer, a keg of beer, alcohol and lots of people. MY mom is putting away money already, she said that money isn't an object for this party, YAY!! It should be very fun. I am really looking forward to all of this. Hopefully, enough people come that will drink a lot because we will have a lot of beer. Then when the party ends we set up a tent, so if anyone wants to sleep there and not drive then they will be able to sleep there. We will have a fire and a sober person will be keeping it lit to keep people warm throughout the night. Then on Saturday after the party, we are going to go out, since I will be 21, YAY!! It should be very fun. I am really excited. This is going to be the best party ever thrown."

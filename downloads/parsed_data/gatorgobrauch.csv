"event","First off, Winnie is doing fine as well as Froggy and Noelle. I'm going to be going back up to Seattle on the 9th of October. I am also about to hit semi-panic mode since midterms are coming up.

Today I had to pick up my kid sister and her son today in LaCombe. I do it to be the good son and bring a bit of diplomacy to the whole affair. To understand the situation with my sister is difficult to explain.
My kid sister is part of a nasty statistic in today's society. She's got a drug problem. She has one son that my mother is raising and another who is 3 months old. She has burned more bridges and people that she is not trustworthy. She and my mother do no get along. If she weren't family, she'd probably go ignored b most of my family. Sometimes she even gets to me and I like to believe that I am a very tolerant person. 
I'm just tired of the war of words between my mom and her and the rest of the family. I get dragged in the middle and am forced to spit out what I know about the other side of the battle. I am to the point of turning my back on everyone about this problem. I am tired of being the family's whipping boy. Unfortunately until I move away from here and get more independent, I have to deal with it. So if you think I'm a wimp, then in your eyes I am."

"event","Well today I went to a comedy show on campus. I see that Ivan doesn't want to die and thus is threatening this area again. I got my marching orders for fall break, I'm going to Seattle to interview at 2 schools their to work in their food service depts. I took a Chemistry test yesterday and a Statistics test today. I'm hoping that I did well on both of them. I really am tired of school now as a student and it is high time I graduate. I did tend to bone up on the Math test. Well not much else to say excpet the same old thing is going on. Winnie and froggy have become buddies fast. It usually takes months and years before cats and dogs become buddies (if ever) and they accomplished that in one day.

Still lonely and to those who are my friends take a look at my music selection for the day"

"event","<P>I didn't really have too much bad go on today. I did get&nbsp;a puppy (lab/dachshund mix) named Winnie. She is as cute as a button. The only real signs of frustration that I can admit to was at Wal-Mart. I was a t the deli counter to get some sandwich meat and cheese. After standing on line for 15 fucking minutes the woman behind the counter tried to serve this guy who just got there. I know it's been a hectic week but she knew I was in line. My frustration was visible but nothing that made a scene. I was this close to going somewhere else for my sandwich meat. </P>
<P>To my newest friend Erin: He is not worth it. I know you love him and feel let down. Just listen to your favorite song and one about your ordeal then have a good cry. It helps. Trust me. Call me if you need someone to talk to ok?</P>
<P>Speaking of tears, last night was another one of those nights. I am getting tired of it and afraid that may happen so often that I can't get to sleep unless I cry first. </P>"

"event","<P>I went to eat at samurai draggon to celebrate my nephew's 8th birthday and they have a sushi bar. Well considering that I love sushi (not all sushi has fish or anything raw in it BTW) and it is an inexpensive apetiser I decided to order&nbsp;a shrimp roll. Needless to say my dad acted like I ordered the most expensive thing on the menu. Then I am told how raw it is (the shrimp was red and white thus it was cooked before being used for sushi) and I explain to them that not all sushi is raw or fish. Considring that in my 6 years of culinary training and working at a few places that had a sushi bar, you'd figure that I'd know a few things about sushi. With my family I could be a top rated brain surgeon with a degree from Johns Hopkins and still get told I don't know a fucking thing. One major pet peeve is when someone asks for any of my expertise thenblow me off as a big fucking idiot. If you think I don't know a fucking thing, why do you ask me? That makes no sense at all, and I'm the fucking idiot?&nbsp;I am looking forward to getting the fuck out of here. That wa if I'm such a fucking waste and disgrace, I can leave here and get a fresh start.</P>
<P>I think I am about ready to give up finding love because those who are honest with me state right out that they don't want me and the rest want to play games. I am tired of being alone, I'm tired of being called ugly, I'm tired of crying myself to sleep. Like Mother Theresa said (and I'm paraphasing her), ""I don't have to like it or want it. But I accept it."" </P>
<P>Maybe you want to put your 2 cents in. Why not? </P>"

"event","I guess I can be like foamy the squirrel in the cartoon Neurotically yours. lol I have just gotten over the fear of Hurricane Ivan, but I have been running a fever off and on since yesterday. To make matters worse is that I haven't had much rest. Currently I am single and alone in this world. I am also growing tired of being single and alone. It has been 2 years since I last had sex. I have found myself crying myself to sleep. My cats have kept me company, I guess they can sense my sadness. Well I guess I'll be signing off for today. See ya!"

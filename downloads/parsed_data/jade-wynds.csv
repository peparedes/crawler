Genre(s): General/Hurt/Comfort

Author Comments: This is a series of one-shots and drabbles that should each be stand-alone, but collectively show the development of a character, so I recommend reading from the beginning. Also, a huge shout-out to my fantastic, patient, and insightful beta, <lj user=""shayheyred""/>&nbsp;

"event","My journal was not supposed to cross with my writing. Ever actually. It was for my rants, random thoughts, and most importantly, to bother other people.<br /><br />However, it's been about 2 years, and I am stuck on this chapter. My beta has done wonders, and given me some very good advice that I have no idea how to execute (namely to condense the second part of the chapter so that it gives new information). So is two years enough of an excuse to break a promise? Probably not, but desparate times...<br /> <lj-cut text=""HALP!

He stood in his habitual slouch in the center of the semicircle of Konoha&rsquo;s leaders.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;As you will soon read in the scroll you just received,&rdquo; the Hokage said, removing the pipe from his mouth, &ldquo;the team you will test includes Uchiha Sasuke.&rdquo; There was a pause, as though he were waiting for the significance to sink in. Kakashi kept his mind blank and waited for the rest.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;He is the last potential user of the Sharingan. Since your transplant, while powerful, has limitations, a fully functional Uchiha would be a huge asset to the village. And you are the only one who can teach him.&rdquo; There was another pause.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Kakashi didn&rsquo;t like where this was going. &ldquo;Furthermore, I believe that the team he has been placed on, while perhaps currently, ah, <i style="""">young</i>,&rdquo; the Hokage smiled wryly for a second, &ldquo;has the potential to be as great as the Sannin. We would rather he not be separated from them.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">So that was what they wanted. Kakashi stared as stonily as he could at the council without being insubordinate. &ldquo;As such,&rdquo; continued a woman to the Hokage&rsquo;s left, &ldquo;although you will, of course, not pass any of them without your sincere approval, we are asking you to be very careful in your evaluation. I think, if you give them the chance, you will find a team worthy of your skills.&rdquo; She flashed him an insincere smile and sat back.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Under his mask, Kakashi pressed his mouth into a thin line. &ldquo;Hokage-sama,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;while I may be a&hellip;harsher judge than some of my colleagues, my decisions are ultimately fair. The teams I failed were unfit for the field.&rdquo; He did not add that &ldquo;unfit&rdquo; was a gross understatement. They were bratty kids who wanted to play ninja, soft and so innocent it bordered on suicidal. There had been nothing in them to make them teams and Kakashi didn&rsquo;t have the time for incompetence. Somebody else could take them into the field to die, but he would not be responsible</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">The Hokage sighed and looked a little tired. &ldquo;Kakashi, you know I agreed with all your decisions. But the law requires all full jounin to take on a team. Just give Team 7 a chance. They may surprise you.&rdquo; Again, he smiled wryly. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;Sasuke is the only Uchiha Itachi didn&rsquo;t kill. We don&rsquo;t know why, but I have no doubt that he has some nefarious plan. If Itachi ever comes back for his brother, you&rsquo;re the only one who can face him and protect Sasuke, Sharingan to Sharingan. We cannot let another innocent die.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Kakashi didn&rsquo;t want a permanent team. He didn&rsquo;t need a permanent team. And he especially didn&rsquo;t need a team of children<span style=""background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"">. For the first time, he regretted quitting ANBU. He was a trained killer, not a babysitter. </span>But he managed to keep his tone in check as he said, &ldquo;Yes, Hokage-sama,&rdquo; before teleporting away</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt; color: red;"">SEE MY NOTES AT THE END OF SCENE 7.

He had long ago settled on an uneasy compromise between the fact that Naruto was Sensei&rsquo;s son and the fact that he was the Kyuubi vessel, which left him watching Naruto from a distance. Kakashi made sure that Naruto stayed alive, more or less dealt on his own, and never intended to get any closer. Maybe the council thought they were throwing him a bone after saddling<span style=""color: red;""> </span>him with the Uchiha. Maybe the Hokage thought he would be kinder to Naruto than other jounin would be. Maybe this was all part of some giant plan that it was not his place to fathom. But the fourth&rsquo;s ability with Kyuubi&rsquo;s massive chakra was sure to be a force to be reckoned with. He read on.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.5in;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i style="""">Last in class.

From the look of it, Naruto was much more like Obito than Sensei, but then there was Mizuki&rsquo;s defeat to consider. He couldn&rsquo;t be a failure and have single-handedly defeated a chuunin with years of experience. It seemed that for now, Naruto remained a wild card. The only thing left to do was meet them all<span style=""color: red;""> </span>and see.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A quick glance at his shadow confirmed that if he walked there at a normal pace now, he&rsquo;d be an hour late, but he felt an odd reluctance to face to them. He didn&rsquo;t even know how to speak to children, let alone form bonds with them. And then there was the fact that they had all but a free pass. How far would he have to lower his bar? It was too much of a headache to deal with right now, so he reached into his pocket, pulled out <i style="""">Icha Icha</i>, and began reading. They could afford to wait.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;"">*<span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>  <p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Kakashi felt like he permanently forgot how much he enjoyed the book. He eventually walked to the Academy with his nose buried in it, and closed it only when he reached the front gate. As always, he mentally floated for a while in it as he sauntered across the yard and down the hallways. Maybe he was going about this all wrong. Perhaps these children would bring the peace and unity the world so craved, and he would help guide them to it. To be a part of something like that&hellip;it would give him a whole new meaning beyond <i style="""">tool</i> and <i style="""">soldier</i>. He finally pushed open the door and surveyed the three children before him. Then a duster fell on his head in a cloud of chalk, and bounced onto the floor. Naruto threw back his head and laughed obnoxiously as he crowed, &ldquo;He fell for it!&rdquo; Haruno immediately started sucking up to him, throwing Naruto into the proverbial kunai barrage in the process. Uchiha Sasuke stared disdainfully, clearly judging him by a presumed inability to dodge a chalk duster.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Kakashi bent down and picked up the eraser. He surveyed his new team. They were about as cohesive as an <i style="""">Icha Icha</i> plot, and brats to boot. He instantly decided that he had been right the first time around, in the council room. Being saddled<span style=""color: red;""> </span>with them was an insult to everything he&rsquo;d been through and every skill he had. Normally he would have failed them on the spot, but this time it looked like he was stuck with them unless they were almost civilian-level. &ldquo;Hmm, how can I put this?&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;My first impression of you is&hellip;well, I hate you.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;"">*<span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">At a loss for how to start, he took them to the roof where Minato-sensei had taken their team and asked the same introductory questions. Naruto demanded that he go first.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;My name is Hatake Kakashi. My likes and dislikes&hellip;&rdquo; He felt <i style="""">Icha Icha&rsquo;s</i> weight in his pocket. &ldquo;I have no intention of telling you about those. As for my dreams&hellip;&rdquo; His dead father and teammates flashed before him. He moved on. &ldquo;I have few hobbies.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">They looked a bit put out, though he couldn&rsquo;t imagine why. But there were bigger fish to fry.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Sensei&rsquo;s features stared at him from a too-skinny twelve year old&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You first,&rdquo; he ordered, looking at Naruto, personal curiousity getting the better of him.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Uzumaki Naruto,&rdquo; Naruto said eagerly, fiddling with his forehead protector. They may have been Sensei&rsquo;s features, but Kakashi had the fleeting feeling that he was looking at Obito&rsquo;s face before Naruto continued.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;I like cup ramen. But I like the ramen Iruka-sensei bought for me at Ichiraku&rsquo;s even more. I hate the three minutes that I have to wait for the water to heat. My hobby is to eat different ramens and compare them. And my dream is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><i style="""">&nbsp;</i></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><i style=""""><span style=""background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"">To be a bowl of ramen</span></i><span style=""background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"">, Kakashi thought before he could stop himself.</span><span style=""color: red;""> [Funny line &ndash; I like it!]</span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;&mdash;to be the greatest Hokage!&rdquo; Kakashi was surprised. He remembered his sensei saying the same words, with the same determination. But where Sensei was smart and skilled, Naruto was about as quick as a punching post, if his file was any indication. What was he thinking, trying to be Hokage? Naruto certainly grew up interesting.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Aloud he said, &ldquo;Ok, next.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Sakura jumped in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Haruno Sakura!&rdquo; she said, far too excitedly for Kakashi&rsquo;s taste. Rin had been much calmer and more mature when they met. &ldquo;I like&hellip;well the person I like&hellip;&rdquo; she blushed and squirmed, glancing at Sasuke. Kakashi groaned inwardly. So that was what he was in for. As if it wasn&rsquo;t bad enough already. &ldquo;And my hobby is&hellip;well, my dream is to&hellip;,&rdquo; she glanced at Sasuke again and squealed, apparently randomly, at a pitch Kakashi didn&rsquo;t know humans could reach. Definitely nothing like Rin.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;And? What do you hate?&rdquo; he prompted, trying to give her another chance. Maybe there was a shinobi underneath all that girl.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Naruto,&rdquo; she stated flatly. Naruto wilted. So much for teamwork. Rin had been their peacekeeper. Sakura was anything but. Girls her age were probably far more interested in boys than training.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Ok, last guy,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;My name is Uchiha Sasuke,&rdquo; the boy declared without looking at the rest of his team. He sat with his fingers intertwined in front of his face as his dark eyes stared intently into the distance.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;There are many things I hate and there aren&rsquo;t a lot of things that I like.&rdquo; Sakura looked disappointed at that. She&rsquo;d have to learn to school her expressions better if she wanted to amount to anything.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;I have an ambition that I do not intend to leave as a dream. The revival of my clan and to&hellip;kill a certain man.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Silence followed this announcement. It was just as he thought, but if Sasuke was seriously hunting his brother, protecting him would be significantly harder. He would have to look into that further. <i style="""">If they pass</i>, he added to himself hastily.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">When they were done, Kakashi announced the test. Predictably, Naruto nearly aneurysmed, Sakura thought they had learned everything they needed to know in school, and Sasuke maintained his scowl. He wondered why he even bothered looking at their files if they were going to be this easy. But as he turned to leave, there was determination on all three faces. Maybe they had a chance in hell. He made sure to mention not to eat breakfast, just in case.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;"">*<span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>  <p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">{In the end, Kakashi tested them as he would any other team. Naruto was an easy read, just like Obito had been, all direct frontal attacks and a huge chip on his shoulder to excel that made him easy to bait.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Sakura was a disappointment. She was clearly intelligent, but&hellip;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Sasuke though. Sasuke was interesting.}</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">The next morning he was especially late. When he showed up five hours after time zero, Naruto and Sakura instantly started shouting at him. He pulled out one of his old favorites. &ldquo;A black cat crossed my path, so&hellip;&rdquo; All three continued to glare at him openly, something none of the other teams had done. He was surprised by a slight twinge of guilt. He coughed in embarrassment and moved on.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Kakshi set the alarm and explained the bell test. <span style=""background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"">Sakura asked almost instantly why there were two bells. At least the girl had a head on her shoulders, when she chose to use it. He explained that at least one of them would fail and that they needed to use shuriken.</span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style=""background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"">&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s too dangerous<span style=""color: red;"">[,]</span> Sensei!&rdquo; she protested. So much for having a good head. She needed to start thinking like a shinobi,</span> something she couldn&rsquo;t learn in her books. Not that Naruto or Sasuke were any better. Naruto even made a jab at his shinobi skills. He literally just told them to treat this as a class 1 retrieval mission but there was no change in their killing intent. Time to try something else. If he failed them after all this, there was no way the council could protest.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;The people who complain most are the ones with the least skill. Just ignore the <i style="""">dobe</i>,&rdquo; Kakashi said calmly in response to Naruto&rsquo;s mockery. That got the kid&rsquo;s attention. He flared his nostrils and bared his teeth in an animal-like grimace. Kakashi could feel the anger radiating off him.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start when I say &lsquo;Ready, start&rsquo;.&rdquo; Naruto pulled out a kunai and raced at him. Kakashi did a quick evaluation: unnecessary time spent twirling his weapon and drawing attention to it, combined with a total frontal attack. Not even an attempt at a diversion. But at least one of them made a move before the signal, and was giving off <i style="""">some</i> killing intent, no matter how diffuse. Of course, it took half a second to grab Naruto&rsquo;s hand and twist so that the kunai was pointing at the back of his head.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so hasty,&rdquo; he told him, voice dangerously soft. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say start yet.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Sakura and Sasuke backed away, clearly intimidated. But they didn&rsquo;t abandon their teammate altogether, like the last team did. On the contrary, both of their faces hardened in determination.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;I think I can finally start liking you three,&rdquo; he told them as Naruto smiled at him. &ldquo;Ok, we&rsquo;re going to start now. Ready&hellip;,&rdquo; he paused as all three of them tensed, balanced on the balls of their feet, &ldquo;&hellip;start!&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;"">*<span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>  <p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Kakshi stood in a clearing near the river. <i style="""">Well</i>, he thought to himself, <i style="""">the concealment basics look solid. Everyone&rsquo;s hidden themselves nicely. </i>That was when Naruto stepped out in front of him, bright orange and well within striking distance. He hated the colour orange.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a match, fair and square!&rdquo; the kid shouted. Forget solid basics, so much for even thinking like a shinobi. Who did something like that?</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit weird, compared to the rest,&rdquo; Kakashi told him.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s weird is your hairstyle,&rdquo; Naruto countered without missing a beat. So personal insults didn&rsquo;t bait him, but ones about his skill did. Interesting. Then Naruto ran at Kakashi with another frontal attack. In response, Kakashi pulled out <i style="""">Icha Icha </i>and Naruto actually halted his idiotic charge to be furious<i style="""">.</i> It was going to be a long morning.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">By lunch, he <span style=""background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"">had tested</span> their taijutsu, genjutsu, and basic principles. Naruto had proven to be a very quick learner. But in the end he was still Naruto, who couldn&rsquo;t execute a sneak attack or spot a trap. Sakura had shown concern for her teammate when Kakashi attacked Naruto, but hadn&rsquo;t actually helped him and had given away her position in the processes. She put up absolutely no fight against the genjutsu later, even though he showed himself to her and made a big deal of blowing an impossible number of leaves around to mark the transition. He really thought that with her mind, breaking the genjutsu would be easiest for her. Rin had always been good with them.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Sasuke was exceptional, probably the best genin the village had seen since Itachi, and the only one Kakashi had ever tested to make him put <i style="""">Icha Icha</i> away. But he was arrogant, the way Kakashi had been at his age. &ldquo;They say that stakes that point out are driven farther into the ground,&rdquo; Kakashi told him after burying him to his neck in the earth. He could feel Sasuke&rsquo;s glare, as he turned and pulled out <i style="""">Icha Icha</i>. As he walked away, he made sure his gait gave the bells an extra jingle. He knew Sasuke wouldn&rsquo;t take the lesson to heart, but maybe he would get the point. It was going to be an especially difficult road with him. <i style="""">If I keep them</i>, he added to himself hastily.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Predictably, Naruto got himself tied to the post. He could hear their stomachs growling. Not ninja material by any means, but they had shown glimpses of promise. He just needed to do one more test.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;The results of this training are that none of you need to return to Academy,&rdquo; he announced. Joy spread across Naruto&rsquo;s face. Setting them up was really too easy.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Sakura looked shocked. &ldquo;Really? All I did was faint. Was that ok?&rdquo; she asked in disbelief. At least she was aware of how abysmally she had performed. Even Sasuke looked pleased as Naruto and Sakura started shouting with joy.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Does that mean we three&hellip;,&rdquo; Naruto began. So it was &ldquo;we three&rdquo; now. They were already starting to think like a team. He might keep them yet, depending on how they dealt with this.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Yes, you three,&rdquo; Kakashi began, closing his eye into his <i style="""">Icha Icha </i>smile, prolonging the moment, &ldquo;should quit being ninja!&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Naruto and Sakura&rsquo;s faces crumpled into shocked dismay, but Sasuke looked furious. Arrogant with a temper. What a combination.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t get a bell, but why do you have to tell us we should quit?&rdquo; Naruto demanded in outrage.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Because you three are just kids who don&rsquo;t even deserve to be ninjas,&rdquo; Kakashi answered sternly. It was true. Their skill levels and attitudes would never have passed muster during the war.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Kakashi could feel the anger coming off Saskue in waves. Then the kid drew a kunai and raced at him head on, much as Naruto had done. But where Naruto&rsquo;s attacks were a part of his personality, Saskue had proven during their brief spar that he knew better. Which meant that he would make poor combat decisions out of anger. Kakashi really had his work cut out for him. To prove his point, he moved at normal speed and pinned Sasuke on the ground before he had time to blink, one foot on his head, with his hand twisted behind his back. &ldquo;See? You all are just kids,&rdquo; he said, putting extra pressure on Sasuke&rsquo;s head and grinding it into the ground. Again, he hoped he got the point. No temper tantrums.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t step on Sasuke-kun!&rdquo; Sakura yelled. So she was willing stand up for her teammate against someone who obviously intimidated her. But, as when Kakashi attacked Naruto, she didn&rsquo;t take action. It was the right idea but it wouldn&rsquo;t fly in the field.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Do you guys think being a ninja is easy?&rdquo; Kakashi demanded. &ldquo;Why do you think we&rsquo;re training by breaking up into groups?&rdquo; And there it was. If they didn&rsquo;t get it after this, he was more than justified for failing them.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Sakura asked.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;In other words, you three don&rsquo;t understand the answer to this test,&rdquo; Kakashi said. He was disappointed. They had shown some potential.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;The answer?&rdquo; Naruto asked.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style="""">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The answer to determine whether you pass or fail.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been asking what that is,&rdquo; Sakura said. At least she looked chastened.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Tch, are your brains empty? Don&rsquo;t you realize why you&rsquo;re in a group?&rdquo; It was like banging his head against a wall. Maybe the potential he had seen was from looking too hard.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;So what about three people being in a group?&rdquo; Naruto shouted in frustration. After all that they didn&rsquo;t get it.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s teamwork.&rdquo; He glared at them all. It seemed they were no different from the others he had tested after all.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;You mean we have to cooperate with each other?&rdquo; Sakura sounded slightly incredulous.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But it&rsquo;s too late now,&rdquo; he told them. His eye narrowed. &ldquo;If all three of you had come at me at once, maybe you could have gotten a bell.&rdquo; Then he sat up and dropped the anger. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; he said off-handedly. There was no way the council could blame him after he gave him all that time to figure it out.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Why do we need to use teamwork if there&rsquo;s only two bells?&rdquo; Sakura asked suddenly. &ldquo;If three people work hard to get it, one person will have to take the fall. A group conflict will occur instead of teamwork!&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">So they finally noticed. &ldquo;Of course. This test tries to pit you three against each other.&rdquo; They Naruto looked shocked, and Sakura glared at him disapprovingly. It was as though the idiots expected a shinobi test to be straightforward. &ldquo;In this situation, we select those who prioritize teamwork before themselves. Well, that was the purpose, but you were pathetic.&rdquo; Time for the lesson. Hopefully it would last them through their next round of Academy. &ldquo;Sakura,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;you cared more about Sasuke than about Naruto, even though Naruto was right in front of you and you didn&rsquo;t know where Sasuke was.&rdquo; At least she looked ashamed.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Naruto! All you did was work on your own.&rdquo; He too looked chastened.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; he said, grinding Sasuke&rsquo;s head into the ground again, &ldquo;assumed that those two were going to burden you and did everything yourself.&rdquo; It was a painfully familiar attitude. But the kid would learn one day.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Missions are done in groups,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that shinobi need well-developed individual abilities, but teamwork is much more important. An individual action that disrupts teamwork will result in the endangerment or even death of the other teammates.&rdquo; And that was something he refused to be responsible for.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;""><span style="""">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;For example,&rdquo; he pulled out a kunai and put it to Sasuke&rsquo;s throat. Time to drive the point home. &ldquo;Sakura! Kill Naruto or Sasuke will die!&rdquo; She and Naruto both looked panicked, but she didn&rsquo;t actually make a move. Then he relaxed his tone and posture. &ldquo;Well, something like that will happen.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Oh you surprised me,&rdquo; Sakura said, relieved, as Naruto sagged against the ropes binding him to the post. They still didn&rsquo;t seem to realize that one day it could be reality.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;After getting someone taken hostage, you will be faced with a difficult decision, and someone will die,&rdquo; he told them, twirling a kunai and keeping his tone casual. He didn&rsquo;t dwell on the memory. &ldquo;In every mission, you put your life on the line.&rdquo; He put the kunai away and got off Sasuke to walk to the memorial stone. &ldquo;Look at this,&rdquo; he told them gravely, &ldquo;the numerous names carved into this stone. All these names are praised as heroes in the village.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;I like the sound of that!&rdquo; Naruto exclaimed enthusiastically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have my name carved into it! A hero! I&rsquo;m not going to die a useless death!&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not normal heroes,&rdquo; Kakashi told him, looking over his shoulder.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;So what kind of heroes were they?&rdquo; Naruto asked, clearly imagining the possible glories. Kakashi looked back at the stone.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, tell me!&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;They were K.I.A,&rdquo; Kakashi said, voice low.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;K.I.A?&rdquo; Naruto asked excitedly.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Those people were killed in action,&rdquo; Sakura whispered.

Then he made a decision. <span style=""background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"">Obito wouldn&rsquo;t have abandoned them when he could teach them so much.</span></p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;I will give you one more chance,&rdquo; he told them suddenly. &ldquo;However, the battle for the bell will be much harder after lunch.

Kakashi chuckled inwardly. So arrogant, but it looked like he had learned his lesson about teamwork, at least.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;We three are going to get the bells together.

Now to see if they would actually risk everything and defy him for their teammate. He watched Sakura pick up a ball of rice with her chopsticks and hold it up to Naruto with a grimace. He opened his mouth and she put the rice in. It was done.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">Kakashi appeared in a huge cloud of smoke. &ldquo;You three!&rdquo; he shouted, racing out of it, looking absolutely furious and radiating just enough killing intent to scare them shitless. Naruto and Sakura both screamed with terror and Sasuke fell into fighting stance.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;You three broke the rule. Are you prepared for you punishment?&rdquo; He formed the hand signs to cast a mild genjutsu that made it look like the sky was roiling with black clouds. He made lightning flash in the clouds and the earth shake. &ldquo;Any last words?&rdquo; he asked ominously. He had to make sure they meant it.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;But&hellip;,&rdquo; Naruto began as Sakura cowered in terror, hands over her head.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Kakashi asked.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;But&hellip;but&hellip;you said&hellip;that&rsquo;s why they&hellip;&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a three man team, right,&rdquo; Sasuke jumped in, fist clenched.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">&nbsp;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 0.5in;"">At that Sakura stopped cowering and looked at him defiantly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!

Ninjas need to think beyond the obvious. In the world of ninjas, those who break the rules are called scum.

"event","As you all know, I like to keep my posts sporadic. But I have to share my awesome day with you (and memorialize it for myself. Because what goes on the internet stays on the internet)  <lj-cut text=""Cut for shameless gloating""><br /><br />To start off, I&nbsp;was supposed to go home this morning, which is pretty exciting in and of itself. I awoke to a beautiful, sunshine-y day. My SO carried my rather heavy suitcase down a lot of stairs without me even hinting at needing help (which isn't extraordinary, but made me feel warm and fuzzy inside). When we got outside it was bitterly cold, and it's a solid 20 minute walk to the nearest public transportation station, probably 30 with luggage. At this point, the lady who lives across the street, who I have never seen in my 2 years in my house, came out her door and offered us a ride into town. She even dropped us off right in front of the T stop. I got to the platform just as the train pulled up and we boarded a miraculously nearly-empty car. <br /><br />This got me to the bus station with about half an hour to spare.  I thought that would be the end of my luck, but when I&nbsp;went to get breakfast, the four people in front of me couldn't decide what they wanted, so I got to skip straight to the front of the line and ordered one of my favourite foods: bagel with lox and cream cheese. The place I&nbsp;got it from usually puts cucumbers on their lox/cream cheese bagels, which I'm not a huge fan of but can live with. However, this morning, not only were they out, but the lady making my bagel felt bad, so she put extra lox on. Then, I&nbsp;got to the bus terminal, to find that they had decided to schedule a bus to leave half an hour before the one I&nbsp;was supposed to catch. I was the last person to make it on.  Once on the bus, I&nbsp;bit into my bagel to find that they hadn't given me normal cream cheese, like they usually do, but had instead put on some sort of delicious herb cream cheese business. <br /><br />After I&nbsp;finished, and was feeling quite pleased with myself, my neighbor on the bus struck up a conversation with me. It was a very nice one, and she was the best bus-neighbor I've had in my four years of making this trip--interesting, not too loud, sweet, and pleasant. After our conversation, I fell asleep with more than my usual ease, slept right through all the parts of the ride that I hate (i.e. the entire state of Conneticut. <strike>KHAAAAAN!</strike> CONNETICUUUUUT!), and woke up when we reached Queens.   I got off the bus, bought my ticket, and was second in line for the bus that would take me home. Not only did I have a chance to have lunch while I&nbsp;waited, I&nbsp;got my pick of seats on a bus that gets so crowded people usually end up standing. <br /><br />Once on the bus, I&nbsp;again slept through most of some very heavy traffic, and made it HOME.  But that's not the end of it, because today was the day we went to see A Prairie Home Companion, which is one of my life dreams. We sat right in the front row, and apparently I'm a good audience member because GARRISON KEILLOR SAID HI TO ME DURING THE SHOW. And as if that weren't enough, the adorable head of the Russian choir they had on took a shine to Mum. AND, they have a special guest. I didn't know who it was going to be. I&nbsp;wasn't expecting anyone who I&nbsp;knew, but it ended up being NORA JONES! The show was fantastic. I love it on air, but it's even better live.   <br /><br />Then we the way back home, we stopped by the grocery store to get ingredients for a shit-ton of baking tomorrow, as well as REAL MEASURING CUPS, which I&nbsp;have been pestering my mother to get forever. We have a snow storm coming, and I'm going to stay in and bake all day. I&nbsp;&lt;3 my life.</lj-cut>"

"event","I have read <em>Twilight</em>. <br /><br />Yes, the entire thing. Cover to cover, every word. <br /><br />And it gave me something of a split personality. On one hand, there's the part of me that analyzed the merit of the book as just that: a work of fiction. Then there was the other part of me that boggled at the Epic Sporfle-Inducement that is this phenomenon (OMGSOEPIC). And so, I&nbsp;present a book review in two <strike>acts</strike> personalities:<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""I. A Book and Its Fan Following"">I. A Book and Its Fan Following<br /><br />As a book, <em>Twilight </em>is incredibly astute in addressing its audience (the hormonal rollercoaster that is the teenage girl). It identifies it and plays to it none too subtly. There is the protagonist, who is a shy bookish girl with lethal clumsiness. She hates being the center of attention and feels she doesn't fit in anywhere. Is that you, every teenage girl ever? Why yes, it is! So now the audience identifies with the protagonist. Then comes the Minor Fantasy Fulfillment Stage. Every boy in the tiny town that she has moved to seems fascinated and madly in love. They line up to ask her to a girl's choice dance (wait, what?), which conveniently introduces the oldest teen-literature plot device known to man: The School Dance. Meyers uses this set up to ominously foreshadow yet another upcoming social event: PROM. Anyway, by this point Future <strike>Vampiric</strike> Love Interest has been introduced and begins to reciprocate the protagonist's <strike>obsession</strike> feelings (which I&nbsp;suppose would make him just Love Interest). There is much cuddling and romance later, which will be dealt with in the next paragraph. This is the Major Fantasy Fulfillment Stage. There is the attraction of Forbidden Love, the Bad Boy, the Rich Boy, and, of course, about 200 pages go to describing how their love is OMGSOTRUE. Need I elaborate on how this plays to the audiences' fantasies? On top of all this, we are constantly reminded how beautiful/stunning/perfect/like a statue of Adonis (there is some shit you can't make up) the <strike>teenage girls' reading this book</strike> protagonist's Love Interest is. Do you see how well Meyer's has targeted her story? Finally, there is a bit of a plot towards the end, involving Some Confusing Plans and Almost Dying. This is sort of the cherry on top. So far, the audience has lived out their fantasy relationship, and to top it off there is some action that could justify liking this book for those who feel ashamed of the gratuitious fantasy-fulfillment that they are secretly sold on. The protagonist is saved by the Love Interest (adding the White Knight attraction) and all is well. Everyone goes to PROM (another typical social event), where the protagonist is told she looks pretty several times while Love Interest is very attentive and possessive. In short, it is the perfect teenage girl fantasy. So I take my hat off to Stephanie Meyers for knowing exactly what to go for*<br /><br />As a story, <em>Twilight </em>is less than stellar. There is Epic Teenage Romance of Epicness (in the way only highschoolers can work it up to be) and then about 3 chapters of plot. The characters are <a href=""http://fc04.deviantart.com/fs28/f/2008/133/e/6/e68024b002996206ec9ddf8001e72e81.jpg"">less than fascinating</a>, and the narrator can get kind of whiny at times. On the up side, most of the characters are written pretty consistently, but we don't see a lot of anyone except the protagonist and her Love Interest (who seems bipolar, but somehow not at all three-dimensional). Speaking of which, the amount of fluff that is in this book is incredible. Every cuddle is described in intricate detail. They stay up all night cuddling while he asks her about her favourite colour and past pets. I kid you not. Then they go to a medow where they cuddle some more. She meets his parents sometime after, and they go to his room and, you guessed it, cuddle. In the middle of all this, whenever the Love Interest looks or smiles or is in the general vicinity, the protagonist's has a choice of a couple reactions: her heart can beat faster, stop (no joke...she was hooked up to a heart monitor, and when he kissed her, she FLATLINED until he stopped. I say unto you, WTF), she can faint (again, literally), jump him, or become unable to complete a sentence. For a fairly accurate sample of the writing, go<a href=""http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081118205253AAY1O9s""> here</a>. It was supposed to be a parody, but that's exactly what it reads like.<br /><br />In short, this book is incredibly well tailored to its audience, and I admire(ed) the shrewdness of the author greatly. But as a story, this did not in any way challenge me or make me think. It did not expand my horizons. It did not even have a plot until about 3/4 of the way through. The universe is not as complete or as compelling as Harry Potter's (honestly, it is an insult to the latter to even compare the two), not to mention much less colourful. The narrator is a teenage girl who is practical and logical, which I appreciated greatly at first, but then who degenerates into whiny and uninteresting. Her boy is annoyingly bipolar and hypocritical. He is usually trying to be boyfriend-y, or is angsting because he thinks that he will kill her eventually. And man, he means business about both of them. He vascillates between these two states of being so quickly that I literally started feeling dizzy. It's like he is some sort of Trick Yo-Yo of Emo and Pain. The other characters are not nearly as annoying, but we definitely do not see enough of them, and when we do, it's through the narrator's haze of teenage-induced self-centeredness. My recommendation: read it if you are extremely bored, but don't expect anything.<br /><br />*<span style=""font-size: smaller;"">Or I did until I&nbsp;found out that it</span><a href=""http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/twilight.html""><span style=""font-size: smaller;""> all came from a dream</span></a><span style=""font-size: smaller;""> and that she is in love with her vampire. Now Bella just feels like a self-insert. And I feel creeped out. *shudder*</span><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br /><lj-cut text=""II. ROFLMAO HE SPARKLES!"">II. ROFLMAO HE <em>SPARKLES!</em><br /><br />This will be a list of all the lol-worthy things that went on in this book. Oh man, the LULZ. They are great and varied.<br /><br />1. The protagonist smells delicious to her vampiric boyfriend. Literally. Like freesia and other flowers. To me, this sounds like she would be an excellent car freshener. To the Vampire of Great Emo, this means FOOD. Can you be emo and want to eat flowers at the same time? YES.<br /><br />2. Their love is so epic! It is a love that has never been loved before! Oh, teenagers. Will you never cease to think that everything you do is the most intense thing ever? Seriously, the sheer teen-ness had me splitting my sides<br /><br />3. The creep factor. We find out later that the vampire has been watching the protagonist sleep. Every night. <em>For months. </em>Stalker much? Her reaction to this is &quot;omg you heard me talk in my sleep *BLUSH*&quot;&nbsp; Not &quot;umm, that's disturbing.&quot; Then again, she does have her own unhealthy side. She says at one point, and I&nbsp;quote, &quot;I couldn't allow him to have this level of influence over me. It was pathetic. More than pathetic, it was <span style=""color: rgb(153, 204, 0);""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>unhealthy</strong></span></span>.&quot; (emphasis mine). Yup, that pretty much covers it. <br /><br />4. The descriptions. Oh my god, the descriptions. Seriously, <a href=""http://otahyoni.livejournal.com/130432.html#cutid1"">how many times</a> do you have to tell us that he's beautiful? Really, it's ok. I got it.<br /><br />5. The Meadow scene. I alluded to it briefly in Personality I. They sort of go on this trek through the woods to his favourite meadow (LOL, he has a favourite meadow.). It is of course full of flowers and sunshine <strike>and frolicking puppies</strike>, but &quot;The meadow, so spectacular to me at first, paled next to his magnificence.&quot; (yes, that is an actual line from the book). Later, they lie down in the meadow, him with his shirt somehow open and her admiring his beautiful torso, and, you guessed it, CUDDLE. They talk about their relationship, how he's dangerous for her, which brings me to<br /><br />5a. His bipolarity. He seems to go &quot;I LOVE YOU! STAY FOREVER! NOOOOO I WILL DESTROY YOU! LEAVE IMMEDIATELY! <em>I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT YOU</em>! *CLING*&quot; It actually gets pretty annoying towards the end, but a couple days after you read it, you start to see the funny side again. There is also the fact that<br /><br />5b. HE SPARKLES. I shit you not. I quote: &quot;He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, <strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);"">incandescent chest</span></span></strong><span style=""color: rgb(204, 153, 255);"">,</span> his <strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);"">scintillating arms</span></span></strong> bare.&quot; (emphasis mine). There are no words. However, if this happens in sunlight, it begs the question of why it doesn't also happen when he's just chilling in a lit room. No one in the book or on the internet has addressed this question, and I'm getting rather curious.<br /><br />So just to recap, the vampire is bipolar with sparkly skin and a favourite medow. But it's ok rabid teenage fans! He's just in touch with <a href=""http://images1.fanpop.com/images/photos/1700000/Entertainment-Weekly-with-TWILIGHT-twilight-series-1782344-500-672.jpg"">his feminine side</a>!<br /><br />6. <strike>I&nbsp;had a six, but I forgot it. I'll come back to put this in later, if I&nbsp;ever remember</strike>. I remembered! The cheese. Holy crap, this was so cheesy. In case the cuddling and the declarations of endless love don't do it for you, there are lines such as:<br /><em>&quot; 'And so the lion fell in love with the lamb.'<br />'Silly lamb.'<br />'Sick, masochistic lion.' &quot;<br /></em>WUT. Who the fuck says shit like that? IRL, if my SO told me that the lion fell in love with the lamb, I would take his temperature or laugh at him. Probably the latter. Imagine it. Yeah. Not normal. Then again, normal and healthy includes Love Interest breaking into her room every night to watch her sleep <strike>/removeing her car battery for a change of pace</strike>, so I suppose that I expected too much. Realistic people in my published works? AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<br /><br />7. The bad writing, the destruction of everything feminists have worked for, and the awful role model protagonist is providing for all the young girls who read this series. Why is this funny, you ask? Because the only other option is crying. Sobbing, bemoaning humanity, and cursing the publishing industry for allowing this drivel to pollute our children are apparently also acceptable alternatives.<br />&nbsp;</lj-cut><br />And that, in a nutshell, is <em>Twilight</em>.<br /><br />"

3) Support of homosexuality is always good. I'm glad JK came out and said this, because it's acknowledging that homosexuals are an accepted and integral part of our culture.

Although thinking of Dumbledore as anything but asexual is kinda hard for me. But if he does have an OTP, I'm glad this is it."

German squirrel on a rampage injures 3 people
72-year-retiree dispatches rowdy rodent with a crutch
9:23 a.m. ET June 14, 2007

BERLIN - An aggressive squirrel attacked and injured three people in a German town before a 72-year-old pensioner dispatched the rampaging animal with his crutch.

The squirrel first ran into a house in the southern town of Passau, leapt from behind on a 70-year-old woman, and sank its teeth into her hand, a local police spokesman said on Thursday.

With the squirrel still hanging from her hand, the woman ran onto the street in panic, where she managed to shake it off.

The animal then entered a building site and jumped on a construction worker, injuring him on the hand and arm, before he managed to fight it off with a measuring pole.

""After that, the squirrel went into the 72-year-old man's garden and massively attacked him on the arms, hand and thigh,"" the spokesman said. ""Then he killed it with his crutch.""

There's some shit you just can't make up.
6/14/07: We will always remember
Also, that's one bad-ass pensioner. No wonder Germany almost took over the world twice."

"event","...so have begun many of humanity's greatest conquests. With shiny. Tonight, it has inspired me to finally update this. More accurately, Adi (world's best muse) swung something shiny in front of my face and I lept to action. No joke. That's /exactly/ how it happened.

So, the question is /why/. Do not answer because, you degree-bearing philosophical smart ass. Because is a sentence fragment. No subject, no verb...WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? But we are not here to discuss this. We are here to discuss humanity's obsession with The Shiny. Modern commercialism would have you believe this is limited to women, and that men will recieve sexual gratification if they present the woman with Shiny. While this may very well be true, DO NOT BE BRAINWASHED. You are not your fucking khakis. Or whatever Zales/Kays/Phil's Diamond Store (yes, this is an actual place) tells you to be. Men are just as obsessed with shininess as women, and it's about time you took responsibility. Again.

Case and point, pirates. Yes, everyone knows that /real/ pirates knit, but the majority of them went on quests for things that sparkled. Like gold and jewels. On the sea. Which also sparkles. They used shiny copper mapping/tracking tools such as a compass and a sextant. They were the ULTIMATE MEN. This leads me to what I feel is an obvious conclusion. Shininess confers supernatural powers upon it's owner. You disagree? You made a sentence with no verb in it. Do shut up.

Adi also brings up a good point, in a full sentence. Cars. Cars are shiny. They are made of shiny things. There are entire machines the size of buildings devoted to making them /shinier/. When that poor sixteen-year old scrapes your bumper, why are you pissed? The machine still works. It's just not as shiny any more. Scientifically speaking, you are succumbing to a long-forgotten instinct: one for POWER. Because it's not as shiny, you essentially figure, it won't run as well. GOD DAMN. Let's fuck the sixteen-year old over in revenge.

MUAHAHAHAHAHA.

Now that you have been enlightened, go. Seek power where it truly lies. None of this politics crap. Buy a floor waxer and redo your entire house. You'll be living like a moral-challenged rapper in about a day.

That is all."

"event","That's right, Adi. I blame you. In my desperation to talk to you, I returned to LJ, and now I have been sucked back into my vortex of A.D.D, doubly so because LJ reminded me of xanga, and xanga led to this entry...

Avast!
Wow. I definitely forgot I had this. But the miracles of boredom...you know. I was reading some of my old stuff, and damn I was angsty. It's actually kind of funny. *pokes emo teenage self* *pooooooooke*
so...yes...I've obviously matured. Huzzah higher education! Wow. No one probably reads this any more. I can write whatever the hell I want.

Are the ducks armed sergant?
outfitted and bullet proofed, general.

Imagine if instead of throwing exploding things at the enemy, you threw bullet-proof ducks. Holy crap if you threw angry bullet-proof geese and they would land and peck the enemy to death in all their goose-y anger. There would be NO SURVIVOURS, 'cause the enemy wouldn't be able to shoot them or anything. And if you can't shoot them, then you certainly can't bludgeon them to death. INDESTRUCTIBLE GEESE OF DOOM. Angry geese are scary as shit too. So, whoever escapes into the woods, they're think they're free, and then HONK a V of geese decend on them and release their righteous wrath. No. Survivours. Wow, I just revamped the entire art of war. Victory is mine!

Which makes me think of Napoleon. Yay Napoleon! He was short. Like that sentence. And that one. And that one. Yay for never-ending loops! And when they did the analysis thing on his body post mortem, they found inordinate amounts of poison in him. Even his hair had poison. Although I do believe hair and nails retain arsenic very well. Keratin anyone? I wonder why. Probably a central ion thing that can form a complex with arseninc. I'm pretty sure arsenic is a negative complex thingummy, so it would work with a central metalic ion, which i know is plausible coz of chlorophyl and haemoglobin and stuff. Although humans don't have chlorophyl in their hair. Or haemoglobin for that matter. Hopefully. I mean, I know blood vessels supply the root, but I don't think you actually have haemoglobin in your hair. Actually, I'm pretty sure.

I'm so full of bullshit.

A fun game. I can't lie though. Probably a bad thing. Oh well. Fucked is also a state of being. I guess its a zen thing. I need to learn how to say that in german. ""Es gibt eine Zen-dinge""? Wasever.

SUPERTOLL!

"event","...humidity. Or whatever else tickles your pickle. Or, if you're Jewish, whatever else pickles your tickle. But I think that Hell is humidity. If you remember, we ended on the indisputable fact that Bush is going to Hell. So now, we pick up at hell itself. I have made a statement. Four years of honors high school english compels me to support that. Let's take a look at hell, shall we?

Christianity would have you believe that it's a fiery chasm of generic uncomfortableness (and doom). My point goes as such: sure, this Hell would be unpleasant, but how much more would it /suck/ if in addition to this fireplace-gone-wrong feeling, you added 100% humidity, with no chance of rain? Surely God, in all his omniscient glory (again, a christian concept. I feel it's only fair to operate by their standards when discussing their hell), would have realized this and promptly done so. But 100% humidity with no chance of rain? You think this is ludicrous. God should at least have the decency to operate by his own rules. I agree with you fair reader, but once again, we are playing by Christianity's rules here. God can do whatever the f*ck he wants. The Bible says so. Isn't it all reassuring? So, God manipulates nature in an unnatural place, and the only logical conclusion is that Hell is a firey torture chamber of blunt instruments and humidity.

Now we move on to literary Christian offshoots. Chronologically, the first one that we must take an afternoon pit stop at on this long road trip through satire is Dante's Inferno. This is quite simple actually. Hell is hot, except at the bottom, where it is cold. Actually, more importantly than it being cold, it is covered in ice. Ice implies water. Please keep this in mind. We now move to the concept of physicality. The occupants of Dante's hell seem to be subject to physical pain. The violent and thieves are tortured in a river of boiling blood, corrupt clergy have their feet scorched, etc. Point three, God is an absentee figure in all of this. He has no direct hand in Hell's workings. The closest we get to divine interference/anything besides complete apathy on heaven's part is a mention of Dante's ""Lady"". So now, let's tie these constructs together. So, physical laws have some affect, God isn't around that much, so these laws probably won't be changing soon, and there is a mixture of heat and a potential water source. Are you thinking what I'm thinking Pinky? That's right! Steam! Which will eventually, over the course of eternity, diffuse throughout hell as humidity. Even in this devout offshoot which has absolutely nothing in common with the Bible-God's direct involvement, humidity is present. It runs through the spectrum. Do not question its presence. 

But, you protest, that was so long ago. What about now? I ask you to turn to No Exit. Sartre had quite a lot right. Hell /is/ often other people. But we are not concerned with this. No, our focus is the atmosphere of the room. ""Stuffy,"" was mentioned several times throughout the play, by all the characters. Now, answer me this: have you ever been in a room made stuffy with dry heat? No. If you answered yes, you are a FOOL. If it was truly dry heat, then more than stuffy, you would have felt unbearably HOT and DRY. Dry heat...a dry, hot atmosphere. Get it? Stuffiness requires humidity. I WIN.

And now, this entry is far too long, so I bid you all farewell (farewell, aufwiedersehen, goodbye). Next time, I rag the conservative approach to homosexuals!"

Ok, so. My main problem with him: IS THE MAN FUCKING INSANE?? I am in high school. I have no people skills. I suck at economics. And here's the catch: even I can see the giant gaping flaws in EVERYTHING that he does EVER. I'm sure that I could find a two-year old with better administration skills. Hell, there's a lady who lives a couple apartments down...I should just go over there, ring the bell, and tell her that her daughter has a higher calling. For humanity's sake. The two-year old (in theory) would do absolutely nothing, which is 100% improvement on Bush, who does things and fucks us over every waking second. The stock market. The gas prices. The government salary raises. House prices. The disenfranchiesd middle class, plundered for the sake of the rich. Mexico laying a claim to arizona. The supreme court. Ruling all three branches of the government. Suppressing free speech. Abortion. Gay marriage. Iraq. Iran. Immigration. Katrina. Pension. Insurance. Education. Stem cells. Religion. The list is endless.

You know how i feel about stupidity. If you don't then you're stupid and its just as well. Well Bush is stupid. No, he's worse than stupid. He's willfully so. And that is unforgivable. He chooses to use the power he was entrusted with to slowly bleed the people who had faith in him of everything. He chooses to turn our attention to non-issues by creating them. He chooses to divide this country. He chooses to send young men and women with their entire lives ahead of them to their deaths. He is a murderer. And the obnoxious thing is, he chooses it and he. doesnt. care.

That man is going to the hell he so strongly believes in."

So, in case you're extraordinarily stupid (don't worry if you are, you're not alone), you've figured out by now that I'm feeling guilty about not having a single entry here. I say, well done, Watson. Have a cookie.

So here I am, inspired and ready to entertain. No, not really. You don't get a cookie anymore, if you believed me. But you can trust me on this, I did have something to say as I was typing the word ""Watson."" If only I could remember what. Alas, fickle memory! That was Shakespeare. And if you believed /that/, then you /owe/ me a cookie.

So, since this is my first time on the page, I noticed a list of my ""friends"" off to the side, with their BIRTHDAYS! My first thought was ""what a place to put it...like anyone's going to see it there"" mainly coz i never visit this page. My second was ""heh. bush must be loving this...it makes everything so much easier.""

Oh, lets discuss that. The president. Goat In Office. You thought that was funny. I am serious. He is a goat in the smelly, rude, stupid, stubborn sense of the word. God, that man needs to be assassinated or something. And now i am going to jail in puerterico. ""O, that we could then come by Caesar's spirit,/And not dismember Caesar!"" That /is/ Shakespeare. For real this time. If you recognize the quote, you don't have to give me a cookie any more *coughcoughGEEKcough* If the ""O"" tipped you off, then Watson, you have officially surpassed yourself. You now get cake. The rest of you, go run away and find the artful doger because i won't feed you. This is MY world, and in it, only the geeks and smart people are rewarded.

And now, my attention span wanders elsewhere, and I am dragged with it. Look, shiny!
(And that, my friends, is the word)."

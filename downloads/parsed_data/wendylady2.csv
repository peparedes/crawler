So I thought I would take a look at the major red carpet trends that emerged from the Golden Globe Awards, and see the kind of looks we can expect from this red carpet season.

So do come on over and take a look:-

My Etsy shop is up and running now, and the prices are pretty reasonable I think - and most importantly, I can also send anything to anywhere in&nbsp; the world !! So come and see some of the brilliant seasonal goodies that have landed on my Etsy page this weekend:-

Lots of lovely goodies for sale at very affordable prices - I know that some websites charge what I consider to be really stupid prices for signed pieces, so I have tried to keep my prices fair and commensurate with the age and provenance of the piece. I have instigated several standard price points for various different levels of quality and size etc, to keep things consistent. Feel free to give me your feedback on photography, price levels, tags, titles and the like - advice and help is always welcome !!</p>

<p>As you can see the first brooch is a big and beautiful brooch in brushed gold-tone metal. This was called <em>&#39;Satin Petals</em>&#39; by Sarah Coventry and was produced in 1966. It was a massively popular design at the time and stayed in production for many years - perfect for the Flower Power trend that was starting in the Hippie movement across America at the time, and also perfect for the newly invented mini-dress made popular by Mary Quant here in Swinging London !!</p><p>Here&#39;s my brooch being worn for the photo on Etsy, and of course, Joanie wearing this brooch with two different outfits on two occasions - (and I thought she had a new brooch with every outfit !!)</p><p><a data-mce-="""" href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_5085-800x533.jpg""><img alt=""IMG_5085 (800x533)"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-381"" data-mce-="""" height=""400"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_5085-800x533.jpg?w=199"" width=""270"" /></a> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <a data-mce-="""" href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/joan-satin-petals-02.jpg""><img alt=""Joan Satin Petals 02"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-383"" data-mce-="""" height=""400"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/joan-satin-petals-02.jpg"" width=""330"" /></a></p><p><a data-mce-="""" href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/joan-satin-petals1.jpg""><img alt=""Joan Satin Petals"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-388"" data-mce-="""" height=""474"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/joan-satin-petals1.jpg?w=284"" width=""450"" /></a></p><h2>LISNER BROOCH</h2><p>Here&#39;s another brooch I have identified as being worn by Joan, with her salmon pink dress and her red dress, very similar in style, both with a slash neckline.- this one was made by Lisner, another high quality jewellery company that was massively popular with fashion-loving ladies back in the 1960s.</p><p><a data-mce-="""" href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_5211-1024x683.jpg""><img alt=""IMG_5211 (1024x683)"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-370"" data-mce-="""" height=""306"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_5211-1024x683.jpg?w=300"" width=""450"" /></a></p><p>This really was a stylish brooch with all the panache of the late 50s/ early 60s, and even though the epoisode where she wears this is set a bit later than that, we have to remember that these brooches remained in production for years in some cases !!</p><p><a data-mce-="""" href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_5277-1024x683.jpg""><img alt=""IMG_5277 (1024x683)"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-371"" data-mce-="""" height=""500"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/img_5277-1024x683.jpg?w=200"" width=""340"" /></a><a data-mce-="""" href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/joan-02.png""> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </a><a data-mce-="""" href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/joan-02.png""><img alt=""Joan 02"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-373"" data-mce-="""" height=""500"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/joan-02.png?w=198"" width=""337"" /></a><a data-mce-="""" href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/joan-02.png""> </a></p><p><a data-mce-="""" href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/joan-01.jpg""><img alt=""Joan 01"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-372"" data-mce-="""" height=""318"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/joan-01.jpg?w=300"" width=""450"" /></a></p><h2>&#39;CORDELIA&#39; BROOCH &amp; EARRINGS SET BY MONET</h2><p>This is no doubt, the most famous and sought after brooch worn by Joan in the series - now identified as being the &#39;Cordelia&#39; brooch designed by the Monet jewellery company, it was released in 1960 and remained in production for a staggering 25 years !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">22nd JULY 1932 - 20th OCTOBER 2014</span></b>
So one of my very<i> favourite</i> red carpet designers has died - Oscar de la Renta finally lost his battle with cancer after fighting a very long time indeed. He was first diagnosed back in 2006, and when he was asked in an interview about it shortly afterwards, this is what he said :-

<i>&quot;Yes, I had cancer. Right now, I am totally clean. The only realities in life are that you are born, and that you die. We always think we are going to live forever. The dying aspect we will never accept. The one thing about having this kind of warning is how you appreciate every single day of life&quot;</i>

He was one of my red carpet heroes, always dressing the stars in the best colours and most flattering shapes specifically for them - above all else, this was his primary concern, and the main reason why he was so popular for over fifty years. You know - so many other designers create collections of clothes in order to express their own creativity, however crazy, but Oscar had a passion for dressing women in order to make them feel spectacularly good - about their bodies, and about themselves - and this is what sets him apart from almost every other fashion designer throughout his lengthy career.

By way of my own little tribute, I thought I&#39;d look at some of the best red carpet dresses I have chosen from his collections during the relatively short time this blog has been up and running, to remember just why I love his work so much:-

<lj-cut>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">OSCAR DE LA RENTA</span></b>
Oscar De la Renta, who was born and raised in the Dominican Republic, trained with Cristobal Balenciaga in Spain and worked with Antonio del Castillo at Lanvin before moving to New York to take a job with Elizabeth Arden. He was a big believer in ready-to-wear back when ready-to-wear was a novel concept and launched his own label in 1965. He has recently seen it grow into a $150 million business.

Here&#39;s what he had to say about his time in various places and people he has worked with.
On Balenciaga:<i> &ldquo;I was picking pins up from the floor.&rdquo; </i>
On how he landed the Lanvin gig: <i>&ldquo;I had never draped anything. But I said, &lsquo;Of course I know how to drape.&rsquo; As I left Lanvin, I went to the telephone booth and I looked in the yellow pages and I found the biggest ad for a fashion school, and said, &lsquo;I just accepted this job to work at Lanvin, so would you teach me in a month what you teach in a year? <span>&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></i>
On being in business for over 50 years: <i>&ldquo;I still have the same passion. In fact, perhaps I&rsquo;m wrong, I think I&rsquo;m a much better designer than I was 50 years ago because I&rsquo;ve learned more. I have a much better sense of who my consumer is. Every single day is a learning process&hellip; Think of who my woman was then, and who she is now. When I first came to New York, a woman in a pair of pants would not be allowed into some restaurants here. Fashion keeps moving. You just have to keep aware of what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</i>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">RUNWAY TO RED CARPET</span></b>
The biggest red carpet events of the year happen in the Spring, mostly, and all of them involve <i>so many</i> female stars parading the red carpet like it was a runway, showing off the most fabulous dresses created for them very often by the world&#39;s most famous fashion designers. Oscar de la Renta was one of the most prolific red carpet designers for around five decades, and most of my &#39;<i>Top Twenty Best Dresses</i>&#39; lists have one or more of his creations in them. Let&#39;s look back at some of the best :-

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">TINA FEY</span></b>
Here&#39;s Tina Fey wearing a gorgeous figure-hugging cranberry-coloured gown at the Golden Globes back in 2012. This was a fabulous colour for her, with her dark hair and fair skin. Unusual for an evening dress on the red carpet, probably because it clashes outrageously !! I don&#39;t think that should deter anyone from wearing this colour though - however, although you don&#39;t spend all evening standing on the red carpet at these events, you do get photographed on it.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v449/wendylady1/Fashion%20Police/Golden%20Globe%20Awards%202007/GG%202012/TinaFey01.jpg"" width=""600"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JESSICA ALBA</span></b>
One of my all-time favourite red carpet looks, Jessica in peach with<i> </i>a<i> spectacular</i> necklace, walking the red carpet at the Golden Globes in 2013. This was on most of the Best Dresses lists at the time and no wonder !! I loved this for the marvellous and unusual colour and the gorgeous shape. Oscar did the fishtail shape with flair and always went for absolute perfection.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v449/wendylady1/Fashion%20Police/Golden%20Globe%20Awards%202007/GG%202013/1JessicaAlba01.jpg"" width=""600"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">OLUCHI ONWEAGBA</span></b>
Here&#39;s an absolutely typical Oscar de la Renta gown - black &amp; white print satin and a huge skirt !! This is Oluchi Onweagba, a top model and this was the Met Ball back in 2009. Simply a fabulous look all round...

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v449/wendylady1/Fashion%20Police/Costume%20Institute%20Gala%202007/2009/OluchiOnweagba01.jpg"" width=""600"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ZOOEY DESCHANEL</span></b>
Proving that he is versatile, here&#39;s another type of look completely - Zooey at the Golden Globes this year, looking totally demure and sweet in crystal-encrusted cream chiffon layers. Oscar used this shape quite often - the short and slightly wide cropped top over a fitted high-waisted skirt - it&#39;s terribly flattering, giving you a waist where you may not have one...

<img alt=""GG 13 Zooey Deschanel 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/1132692/1132692_600.jpg"" title=""GG 13 Zooey Deschanel 01"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">IVANKA TRUMP</span></b> <span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><b>&amp; KARLIE KLOSS</b></span>
From one of my huge Met Ball posts, here&#39;s Ivanka looking absolutely smashing in brilliant zingy lime and dark green at the Met Ball earlier this year. Also at the same Ball, Karlie Kloss in black &amp; gold...

<img alt=""MB 14 Ivanka Trump 01"" height=""609"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/1132815/1132815_600.jpg"" title=""MB 14 Ivanka Trump 01"" width=""392"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""MB 14 Karlie Kloss 01"" height=""609"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/1133162/1133162_600.jpg"" title=""MB 14 Karlie Kloss 01"" width=""430"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">TAYLOR SWIFT</span></b>
Here&#39;s singer Taylor Swift knocking &#39;em dead at the same ball, in this stunning pale pink gown with an absolute corker of a train - Oscar had a good night that night !!

<img alt=""MB 14 Taylor Swift 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/1133316/1133316_600.jpg"" title=""MB 14 Taylor Swift 01"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">AMY ADAMS</span></b>
One of Oscar&#39;s most famous red carpet dresses - here&#39;s Amy at the Oscars in 2013, looking like she should get the Oscar for best ruffled gown. If anyone showed up in something like this, it was a good bet that it was Oscar&#39;s work !!

<img alt=""O 13 Amy Adams 01"" height=""499"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/1133588/1133588_600.jpg"" title=""O 13 Amy Adams 01"" width=""800"" />

<span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><b>RECENT COLLECTIONS</b></span>
I haven&#39;t covered the RTW Collections for next Spring yet, but the Oscar de la Renta Collections over the last few seasons have been amazing for red crpet dressing - here are a few designs that we might get to see next Spring perhaps.

<span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><b>RTW - SPRING/SUMMER 2014</b></span>
My own four favourite designs from this year&#39;s Spring collection, shown last September...they&#39;re all so pretty !!

<img alt=""SS14 Oscar de la Renta 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/1130744/1130744_600.jpg"" title=""SS14 Oscar de la Renta 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""SS14 Oscar de la Renta 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/1130811/1130811_600.jpg"" title=""SS14 Oscar de la Renta 02"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">RTW : AUTUMN/WINTER 2014</span></b>
These beauties were shown last Spring for the current Autumn season - aren&#39;t they fabulous ?!! The amazing red gown with the gold embroidery was worn by Freida Pinto at this year&#39;s Cannes Film Festival if you remember. No-one&#39;s worn the brown design next to it, but it&#39;s only a matter of time, I reckon !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">RTW : SPRING/SUMMER 2015</span></b>
One of his most youthful collections of all - and sadly his last as it turned out -&nbsp; was the collection shown at this Autumn&#39;s New York Fashion Week, for next Spring - here is the beautifully fresh and very Spring-like pink &amp; green story at the end of the show:-

<img alt=""SS 15 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/1135067/1135067_600.jpg"" title=""SS 15 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""SS15 03"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/1135381/1135381_600.jpg"" title=""SS15 03"" />

<img alt=""SS15 04"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/1135619/1135619_600.jpg"" title=""SS15 04"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""SS15 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/1135339/1135339_600.jpg"" title=""SS15 02"" />

The collection wasn&#39;t totally all about pale green and pink though - there were some really beautiful black and white creations too:

<img alt=""AW14 Oscar de la Renta 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/1130389/1130389_600.jpg"" title=""AW14 Oscar de la Renta 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="""" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/1130100/1130100_600.jpg"" title="""" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">AMAL ALAMUDDIN&#39;S BIG DAY !!</span></b>
Of course, Oscar de la Renta will always be remembered for the last really big private commission he did - the wedding dress for Amal for her highly publicised wedding to George Clooney !! Here she is getting the most beautiful dress of her life fitted perfectly by one of Oscar&#39;s assistant&#39;s - and she looks fabulous of course !!

<img alt=""Amal-Alamuddin-Marries-George-Clooney-3"" height=""670"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/1128655/1128655_600.jpg"" title=""Amal-Alamuddin-Marries-George-Clooney-3"" width=""800"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">THE FUTURE</span></b>
He will be sorely missed, but his design company will endure - Ex-Nina Ricci designer Peter Copping has recently been appointed as Creative Director, so it&#39;s clear that Oscar was retiring, but he surely leaves enormous shoes to fill, doesn&#39;t he ?!!
Oscar anounced this news just a week ago on October 13th :-
&quot;<i>I&#39;m very happy Peter has agreed to join us. He is a great talent and along with our shared design sensibilities, we both have a deep curiosity about the wider world, from music and art to architecture and gardens. Our industry has not always done the best job when it comes to changes in design leadership. My hope is that, in leading this selection, and actively participating in the transition, I can ensure the right design future for our company and brand.&rdquo;</i>

After his latest runway show, at New York Fashion Week in September, one of his top models Karlie Kloss posted a short note on her Instagram page -
<i>&ldquo;There is no one on earth who makes a woman feel more beautiful than Oscar de la Renta.&rdquo;</i>

As it has turned out, this happened to be a fitting tribute, I think !!

Well, shove it on e-Bay, of course, with lots of clear and detailed photos, in the hope that maybe someone like me will look at it and make a bid&hellip;</span>
<p><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Over the last year, I have been dealing in vintage jewellery mainly on e-Bay, under the name &lsquo;wendylady2&prime;, and thus far have learned SO much about various jewellery manufacturers, and their different styles and signatures. It&rsquo;s been quite an education !!
My favourite eras are the 1950s &ndash; so stylish and sophisticated &ndash; think of &lsquo;Mad Men&rsquo; &ndash; all smart suits and cocktail dresses, usually adorned with a large gold brooch from Trifari or Monet, or perhaps a beautiful heavy Egyptian-style collar necklace &ndash; and the big &amp; bold 1980s, with well-made and beautifully designed pieces that really stand out in the crowd, like the enormous goldtone leaf brooch above !!
Gradually my collection of stock has grown until I have a huge selection of really beautiful signed pieces from the biggest and most successful jewellery companies of the day, and it got me thinking that, actually, these pieces deserve somewhere a bit more upnmarket than e-Bay I think, with fixed prices to reflect how much work was done in the process &ndash; researching, finding other similar pieces, and sometimes identifying pieces too, which is often a bit of a challenge !!
Therefore this shop was created, and now I am in the lengthy and slow process of listing the several hundred items I now own, and offering them for sale to you.</span></p><p>Here is a small selection of what I have uploaded to my Etsy shop thus far :-</p><h4><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MONET</span></h4><p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4696-800x533.jpg""><img alt=""IMG_4761 (533x800)"" class=""wp-image-327 alignleft"" height=""819"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4761-533x800.jpg?w=322&amp;h=479"" width=""550"" /> </a></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">A couple more from my amazing collection of brooches and other jewellery pieces by the &lsquo;Monet&rsquo; company &ndash; the first is a very long-stemmed Carnation flower with four layers of petals, in highly detailed texture. This brooch was brought out in the 1960s and was called &lsquo;Bouquet&rsquo;. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s featured on p.164 of Alice Vega&rsquo;s excellent book on the history of the Monet company: <em>&lsquo;Monet The Master Jewelers&rsquo;</em> &ndash; a valuable research tool, by the way !!</p><p style=""text-align:left;"">I love this beautiful brooch for its fabulous bold design and yet flowing fluid lines. There several other designs in this series according to the 1960s Monet catalogue page printed in Alice Vega&rsquo;s book.</p><p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4696-800x533.jpg""><img alt=""IMG_4696 (800x533)"" class=""wp-image-328 alignright"" height=""372"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4696-800x533.jpg?w=410&amp;h=277"" width=""550"" /></a></p><p style=""text-align:left;""></p><p style=""text-align:left;"">The second is a late 1960s Bar brooch, designed in the updated 1960s version of the Art Deco style of the 30s, which was very popular then. This brooch was, amazingly, in production from the late 60s until the late 80s, because it was such a popular design &ndash; that&rsquo;s why you see so many of them on second-hand sites like e-Bay!! For that reason, mine is slightly cheaper than you&#39;d expect for a Monet item.</p><h4><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">NAPIER</span></h4><p><a href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4705-800x533.jpg""><img alt=""IMG_4705 (800x533)"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-329"" height=""372"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4705-800x533.jpg?w=474&amp;h=320"" width=""550"" /></a></p><p><a href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4725-800x533.jpg""><img alt=""IMG_4725 (800x533)"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-330"" height=""372"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4725-800x533.jpg?w=474&amp;h=320"" width=""550"" /></a></p><p>A couple of glorious 1980s necklaces by &lsquo;Napier&rsquo; &ndash; the first is a faux-pearl and twisted gilt-rope linked necklace with chain-links between each pearl, and secondly, a very popular 1980s style, the large bib choker-length necklace on a flat snake chain.</p><h4><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">TRIFARI</span></h4><p>One of the most popular and well known jewellery companies is of course, Trifari. From the 1950s/60s of their heyday up until the 1980s, they are now undoubtedly one of the most sought-after jewellery manufacturers of the mid-20th Century vintage market. I have several beautiful pieces of 1960s Crown Trifari, and later designs from the 1980s too.</p><p><a href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4777-800x533.jpg""><img alt=""IMG_4777 (800x533)"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-343"" height=""373"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4777-800x533.jpg?w=459&amp;h=311"" width=""550"" /></a></p><p>Crown Trifari clover flower earrings from the 1950s.</p><p><a href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4661-800x533.jpg""><img alt=""IMG_4661 (800x533)"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-344"" height=""373"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4661-800x533.jpg?w=459&amp;h=311"" width=""550"" /></a></p><p>Crown Trifari swirly leaf brooch from the 1960s.</p><p><a href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4666-800x533.jpg""><img alt=""IMG_4666 (800x533)"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-345"" height=""374"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4666-800x533.jpg?w=458&amp;h=311"" width=""550"" /></a></p><p>A later design from the 1980s &ndash; just Trifari this time.</p><h4><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">WEST</span></h4><p><a href=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4640-800x533.jpg""><img alt=""IMG_4640 (800x533)"" class=""alignnone  wp-image-331"" height=""305"" src=""https://vintagejewelleryfun.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/img_4640-800x533.jpg?w=451&amp;h=305"" width=""451"" /></a></p><p>A simply stunning blue, green and gold enamel butterfly brooch, adorned with sections of pav&eacute; diamant&eacute; on the wings and three diamant&eacute; stones down the body, designed by &lsquo;West&rsquo;.

Sadly my computer has executed a superb crash &amp; burn maneouvre, which means that all my photos from the Couture Collections have been lost - for the time being anyway !! I will be taking the whole thing back to the Audio/TV Dept at work where the Tech Elves can examine it and hopefully bring it back to life. In the meantime, until then, I am having to use my laptop, which does have an alarming tendency to overheat every so often and display the orange screen of death. So I will be putting the Couture Collections onto the back burner for now, and hopefully come back to them when I get my computer back, probably after our week in Italy next week. I am hopeful that my docs, pics and other sundry files can be saved, because there was an awful lot of stuff in there.

Boo !!..."

<span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">(&amp; THE ONES THAT PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE STAYED HOME !!)</span></b></span>

The Annual Whack-fest that is the Teen Choice Awards happened in Hollywood on Sunday evening, and as usual, there were simply dozens of the trendiest,&nbsp; and most fashion-forward Hollywood hot young things taking <i>all kinds </i>of wonderful risks on the red carpet, and thus moving the whole &quot;red carpet fashion&quot; thing forward a notch or two at the same time. Don&#39;t expect to like all my choices&nbsp; - I love a risk-taker on the whole, because, in my opinion, it&#39;s a good thing for red carpet fashion generally to have them in the forefront of things - keeps us all on our toes, don&#39;t you think ?!!

You can expect lots of hot sizzling colours, lots of skin on show and lots of really <i>youthful </i>fashion !! New red carpet trends include shorts and play-suits (in the manner of the hot pants of the 70s, so there&#39;s nothing new really !!), lots of funky shoes, lots of neon colours, and lots and lots of <i>attitude !! </i>
Oh yes, and the red carpet is blue...
<lj-cut>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">MOST INTERESTING FASHION OF THE EVENING !!</span></b>
Instead of picking out the Best Dressed of the evening, this time I decided to choose the &#39;Most<i> Interesting </i>Fashion of the Evening&#39; instead - a subtle difference, in that something might grab my attention for being unusual and really out there trend-wise, but the person may not actually necessarily be the Best Dressed in the conventional sense.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">BELLA THORNE</span></b>
Bella chose this modern take on 1950s vintage with this little frock designed by Johnny Wujek for Candies - a bit of an inspired choice for an event like this, what with all the vintage trends around at the moment. I like the huge blue flower print, especially with her red hair, and I like the triangular shape of the skirt. I&#39;m not quite so hot on the ultra-low faux-plunge front, as the nude panel is a bit too obvious - I think it would have been miles better with just a conventional strapless front or perhaps a <i>bit </i>of a plunge, but a real one !!

Make up is fresh-faced and pretty and I also <i>love</i> the matching blue pointy-toed court shoes.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CHELSEA KANE</span></b>
Chelsea Kane went with the black top and brilliantly coloured print skirt option, and she looked great in it - this was actually a British High Street chain outfit, so we can be proud that our High st. fashion is up to the mark !! The top is by Alice &amp; Olivia and the fabulous floral skirt is by H&amp;M !!
I love this look on her - the casual cropped hair showing off the diamant&eacute; earrings, the orangey-red lipstick picking up the colour of the skirt print, and the orange-soled black patent sandals, all combine to give her a perfectly co-ordinated look. When it comes to red carpet dressing, if you attend to the tiny details, you&#39;ll find that your whole look is a million times better !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CHER LLOYD</span></b>
Cher Lloyd went down the road of co-ordinating separates too - this sheer beaded body-top is by Amen and the teeny black shorts are by Theory. These were not the only shorts worn that evening by a long shot - it became something of a trend along with all the cropped tops on show.
I really liked this look on Chloe - it&#39;s fun and sexy, without being too revealing or tacky in any way !! From her long wavy hair and fresh well-defined make-up down to her Jimmy Choos, she simply oozes Hollywood star appeal - she&#39;s certainly left the X Factor way behind !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CHLOE GRACE MORETZ</span></b>
Oh, I love this !! The red, black and white embroidered jacket looks just like an Eastern European folk-art masterpiece, and I have photographs from the Ethnographic Museum in Krakow, Poland of peasant costumes that look similar to this to prove it. This outfit is actually from the Resort 2015 Collection by Valentino, and it rocks !!
Chloe is young enough and slim enough to wear a very abbreviated crop-top, coupled with shorts - both very strong trends at this event.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HAILEY REESE</span></b>
Singer Hailey Reese looked amazing in this skin-tight black body-con dress with off-the-shoulder/halter neckline and gold chain detailing, The shape of this dress combined with the bleached beehive hairdo and the red lipstick puts me in mind of the 1950s wiggle dresses that Marilyn Monroe favoured. The whole look has a real 1950s vibe with a bit of 1970s Punk thrown in,&nbsp; which frankly, is always interesting !! Hailey is a curvy gal which only goes to prove that this kind of dress&nbsp; looks just as great on a size 12 as it does on a size 6 - any bigger than that though, and the side cut-outs might become a bit embarrassing, so beware&nbsp; !!
Huge silver glittery platforms lend this a bit of a 21st Century feel, but would black ones have been better ?

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HILARY DUFF</span></b>
<span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Hilary Duff looked sensational in this beautiful black leather skirt from ASOS, and an embellished top</span> from the Sachin &amp; Babi Noir Collection for Spring 2014. This is a design duo who have been working together for about twenty years, producing embroidery and appliqu&eacute; concepts for various designers, and since 2009, have been creating their own collections for their star client&egrave;le.
I loved this beautiful look - very simple and yet quite individual. The red appliqu&eacute; flowers are unusual and original, and very pretty !!
Hilary kept it all very simple with a simple bob and fairly neutral make-up, a black and gold box-clutch, and plain black court shoes.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JOEY KING</span></b>
Joey chose a bright orange frock with black and gold beading round the halter-neckline and the waist, and wore it with her hair up off her face except for her fringe and creamy-beige lace-up shoes from Louboutin. I would have preferred black shoes with this really, but the beige is OK. I love the colour on her, and I am glad she didn&#39;t try and match lipstick too harshly. It&#39;s a softer colour altogether, which is right for her age -&nbsp; there&#39;s nothing more ageing than a lip colour that is too severe.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KATIE LECLERC</span></b>
Katie is clearly a bit of a risk-taker with this peachy orange body-con dress with a neon yellow print all down the front panel. I love that she wore orange instead of the usual blue-green colours that are prescribed as being perfect for a redhead - it&#39;s a risk worth taking sometimes in my view !! This looks great, especially with the bright yellow clutch, and bright yellow toe-nail varnish.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KYLIE JENNER</span></b>
Kylie came with sister Kendall, and her half-sister Kim Kardashian - out of the three, Kylie looked better than either of the other two. She went for this really interesting print skirt from Sass &amp; Bide, and teamed it with a plain black, cropped and sleeveless, knitted top. I love the skirt - it&#39;s a typical print from them and an unusual tulip shape too.
She wore it with high heeled black lace-ups and barely there make-up, and looked fab as a result !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LUCY HALE</span></b>
This is an interesting little dress from Raf Simons at Christian Dior - a very abbreviated version of the Dior New Look shape, in party dress form !! I like the fact that there is a black line around the hem as if the fabric goes underneath in a bubble shape, in a&nbsp; contrasting colour. I don&#39;t think it does that actually, but it looks as if it does !! I like the artificially belled out skirt and the shiny Duchess satin it&#39;s made in - this is the best satin to use for evening wear as it doesn&#39;t crease too much. I love the spiky, punky shoes worn with black toe nail varnish, and the messy plait that seems to be a growing trend on the red carpet these days.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">RITA VOLK</span></b>
Here&#39;s another interesting little dress - this time, it&#39;s a little number called &#39;<i>Kix</i>&#39; from Three Floor, and cost &pound;138 !! Not an expensive design for a red carpet appearance really.
I like the unusual shape of this and the illusion cut-out strip which is actually a sheer panel, going round the back in a V-shape. I like the 90s off-the-shoulder body-con look of this, and the fact that it&#39;s longer in the back than it is in the front !!
Her black suede sandals lined with fuchsia leather are also very cool.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">RYAN NEWMAN</span></b>
I love this pretty floral print dress with lime green webbing straps that actually cross at the back. Usually I am not that fond of bright yellow and pink flowers with bright green leaves, but in this instance I am making an exception. Ryan is wearing this particularly well, in my opinion. It suits her and she&#39;s young enough to carry it off, especially with the bright neon yellow bag.
Like Katie Leclerc, Ryan went off to Mr Baker for her dress - this is the &#39;Taylar&#39; dress - yours for the princely sum of $275&nbsp; - marvellous stuff !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SARAH HYLAND</span></b>
Sarah Hyland went for this heavily sequinned little gunmetal number designed by Marc Jacobs from his Resort 2015 Collection. I liked this because it suits her even though it&#39;s not quite as adventurous as some of the others - wearing something you&#39;re comfortable in is vitally important at a red carpet do, especially if you find yourself in the situation of being photographed at every turn !!
Like Sarah, keep your make-up well-defined but essentially as natural as possible, with liberal use of mascara and eye-liner, and a slightly darker than your natural shade of lipstick.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SHAILENE WOODLEY</span></b>
Oh I <i>really</i> like this, but not everyone else did - this has divided opinion in some quarters, and by and large, the people who disliked this said it looked frumpy because it was about one inch below the knee !! Well - <i>hello people </i>- get used to this because it&#39;s a big new trend !! This was designed by hot British design label Peter Pilotto for their Autumn 2014 Collection. And actually, either Shailene is <i>astoundingly</i> tall, or, more likely, this has been shortened from the runway original, as the skirt-length ended up around the model&#39;s mid-calf point.
Peter Pilotto and his design partner Christopher Vos are renowned for their amazing digital prints, and this gorgeous dress is no exception - it is unusual, highly original and a brave step for Shailene, in that it is really going out on a limb here.
She kept everything else really simple - a good thing with such an eye-catching print. Slicked back hair, natural make-up and wine-red shoes to pick up the colour in the print - perfect !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ZENDAYA COLEMAN</span></b>
This beautiful pink dress worn by Zendaya also split opinion, with half loving it and the other half throwing it into their Worst Dressed lists on the grounds that it was &#39;<i>one hot mess</i>&#39; !!
Well, what do they know ?...
I love the whole look here - she does look a bit like a Rihanna wannabe, but is that a <i>bad</i> thing ? She could do a whole lot worse than emulate Rihanna, a singer well known, and liked, as much for her fashion choices as for her music.
This was a custom design from Material Girl, the fashion clothing line created by Madonna and her daughter Lourdes, for which Zendaya has agreed to become the face for the brand this year. This is her take on her dress :-
&ldquo;My stylist, Law, came up with the idea for it to reflect Madonna&#39;s original dress she wore in her video, so if anyone&rsquo;s ever seen &#39;<i>Material Girl&#39; -</i> (the hit song video) - this is the updated version. It&#39;s a tribute to the one and only - I hope Madonna loves it.&rdquo;

She also sported a sassy new hairdo and armfuls of bangles and rings in silver and giant crystals to complement the dress. Shocking-pink patent courts finished it all off - fabulous !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">THE ONES THAT SHOULD HAVE STAYED HOME !!</span></b>
So those were all my picks for the &#39;Most Interesting Fashion Choices&#39;, but what of the stars who simply made the <i>wrong</i> choices ?...and we all know there&#39;s nothing worse on a red carpet, than picking the wrong thing !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">EMILY OSMENT</span></b> <b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">&amp;</span></b> <b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SHAY MITCHELL - LINGERIE QUEENS</span></b>
Both Emily Osment, here, and Shay Mitchell just below are guilty of the same crime - and I&#39;m sorry to have to say this again, and again - but there are certain styles of dress that simply look<span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><i> just like underwear</i></span>, especially if it has proper bra-cups and seams everywhere like classic corsetry - so my message to all these stars is this :-
Styles like this look like they&#39;re designed to be worn <i>underneath </i>your chosen dress - the clue is in the name !! It may be well sexy and cute and everything else, but in the end, if it looks like underwear to me, than it probably looks like underwear to at least half the Western World, and pretty much everyone elsewhere too - therefore it probably should be avoided like the plague !!

Shay Mitchell went for the matching bra-top and underskirt option, and agreed, it&#39;s <i>amazingly</i> beautiful, but in a wedding-night sexy lingerie sort of way...this is from the Misha Collection, and it&#39;s supposed to be a proper evening ensemble, but all the same...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KENDALL JENNER</span></b>
Kendall Jenner made it into pretty much everyone&#39;s Worst Dressed list with this truly awful jumpsuit with sheer panels down each side. This was designed by Oriett Domenech, from his Spring 2014 Collection, and should have looked somewhat better than it did. The top half of this is rather beautiful actually, and therefore should have wowed everyone - instead everyone looked at her and went :-

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MARY MURPHY</span></b>
Oh my - Mary is scaring me just with her smile !! She is a champion ballroom dancer and one of the judges on &#39;<i>So You Think You Can Dance?&#39;</i>, but she really needs to sort her fashion issues out - for instance:-
*Too many neon colours going on here - (red and bright pink on the whole doesn&#39;t work - orange and bright pink does - discuss !!)
*Too blocky a shape for her, especially with the illusion created by the black shrug.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">TAYLOR SWIFT</span></b>
Taylor usually ends up in my Best Dressed list, so I&#39;m not sure what went wrong here, but I hate this whole outfit !! Yes, indeed - from the nonentity of the boring green colour, and her mid-length non-hairstyle, to the too-small gap between the cropped top and the rather high-waisted skirt, to the awkward triangular shape, and frankly, I&#39;d rather not have any straps at all than have ones that look like bra-straps !!

That&#39;s it for this event - I could have made this a lot longer, as there were loads and loads more stars than I have covered here, but in the end, I decided to stick to just the stars I felt strongly about, than cloud the issue with lots of more mediocre styles.

I&#39;m sure you have lots of opinions about this event - so let&#39;s hear &#39;em...

Part 2 of my look at the Resort Collections for 2015 starts with Marc Jacobs, and works through many of my favourite red carpet designers - Marchesa, Monique L&#39;Huillier, Naeem Khan, Nina Ricci, Oscar de la Renta, Pamella Roland, Prabal Gurung, Ralph Lauren, Reem Acra, Tadashi Shoji, Vionnet and that master of the hourglass figure, Zac Posen !! This is a real roll-call for evening-wear designers from all the major four fashion centres, so popular has the notion of a Resort Collection become. Soon we&#39;ll just call it what it is - a Winter Collection. I think it&#39;s about time we renamed the four seasons what they are - Spring, Summer, Autumn or Fall, and Winter - after all, how many people really go on a holiday every year over the winter months? Why is it called &#39;Resort&#39; in this day and age? The whole thing is a teensy bit daft, don&#39;t you think ?!!
Anyway, do come and see what I have picked for the red carpet next Winter.

<lj-cut>

We&#39;ll start with one of the most popular designers of recent years - Marc Jacobs...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MARC JACOBS</span></b>
Marc&#39;s design team for the Resort Collection is headed up by Design Director, Joseph Carter, who described the collection as &#39;&quot;<i>People getting dressed up, going out. Happy, lively,&quot;</i> which is pretty much what they delivered here. There were lots of vibrant colours, a fabulous late 60s/early 70s style print which featured on quite a few designs in three colour-ways, lots of ultra-short minis in colourful crushed velvet adorned with pearls, sequins and glittery bows etc...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MARCHESA</span></b>
The girls at Marchesa created a resort collection so typical of their style, that most of these dresses stand a fantastic chance of being worn at some red carpet do or other. They are an extremely popular design team, and have been for a number of years now - and they have produced some real corkers here !!
I absolutely love the pastel rainbow print overlaid with bits of black lace - very unusual - and the peachy dress with a sculpted rose on the shoulder, and the shorter duck-egg blue ruffly dress beside it. - it&#39;s all gorgeous stuff !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MONIQUE L&#39;HUILLIER</span></b>
Monique L&#39;Huillier is another very popular red carpet designer - it&#39;s not often that we see an awards event without one or two of her designs being worn !! Here she concentrated on expanding her day-wear lines too, but that didn&#39;t stop her producing a fabulous collection of evening-wear goodies for us to enjoy, come awards season !!
My own favourites include the very unusual fuchsia-pink ruffled skirt with a sculpted T-shirt shape top, that has a short front and a long back, worn over it - also the white top with a black skirt and vice-versa - very contemporary !! Evening separates are not what we usually see, but it makes a nice change.&nbsp; There were quite a few short frocks as well as the full length evening-wear gowns.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">NAEEM KHAN</span></b>
Naeem Khan gets most of his inspiration from all the travelling he does every year - every time he brings out a collection, you can almost guess where he went for his hols !! This time, he went off to Mexico City first, for a fashion event down that way, and he produced a fine little story within this collection involving Mexican peasant embroidered tops &amp; shorts and short dresses - great youthful party-wear or maybe for a film press launch / premi&egrave;re - that sort of thing.

He also went back to his native India to get inspiration - evident in the amazing pearly-sequinned dresses, tops and skirts, which reminded me of those desks and tables you can buy with inlaid mother-of-pearl swirly floral designs - gorgeous stuff !!

The other story was the most interesting Art Deco print that reminds me of the New York Chrysler building - a bit - from that era anyway !! White on black, in a shorts and top set and a short dress - this is sure to appeal to younger stars on the red carpet. Going on with the Art Deco-styling were a couple of designs - a one-shouldered dress and a kaftan, with radiating stripes in black and red.
The rest of my picks are all in his usual gorgeous embellished style, with surface embroidery, sequins and beading.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">NINA RICCI</span></b>
Some beautiful stuff from designer Peter Copping for the Nina Ricci brand for Resort next year, apparently inspired by flicking through a set of three books celebrating 125 years of the National Geographic magazine. Clearly lots of influence and inspiration from this, judging by the whole collection together. Here, I have picked out four ruffled evening dresses that I fell in love with - out of the whole collection these are the four that I reckon we&#39;ll see.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">OSCAR DE LA RENTA</span></b>
Oscar de la Renta agrees with me - the term &#39;Resort&#39; is an arbitrary term that means very little - why not call this a Winter collection, and be done with it - because that&#39;s what it is !!&nbsp; &quot;<i>Resort means nothing. Who buys clothes exclusively for going to a resort?&quot;</i> - Yes, quite !!

Here he produced a great little collection - well, little for him, but it still ran to 38 designs - concentrating on really good day-wear separates, and a number of excellent monochrome cocktail dresses - short flirty little numbers with embroidery all round the skirts and interesting shapes.
For evening though, he really pulled out the stops with some gorgeous red carpet designs - I loved the hot pink double act adorned with gold embroidery, and the sheer black dresses with banded lace that looked like cage-work.
Lastly, I chose a beautiful fully embroidered strapless cream dress adorned with multi-coloured flowers and leaves, with a pale pink bow and sash going to the floor behind - this is a winner - mark my words !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">PAMELLA ROLAND</span></b>
Pamella produced some very interesting design ideas for this collection, somewhat inspired by her own mother&#39;s garden, apparently. The beautiful floral print is the most obvious evidence of this - purple and black on a grey background - it sounds awful when I describe it, but it&#39;s really beautiful, and she made two dresses out of it, one short and the other full length !!
Also loved the black and white blurry abstract print in satin and the other plain bright colours that I have put with it - strong stuff and very eye-catching !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">PRABAL GURUNG</span></b>
Apparently inspired by an exhibition of British artist Matthew Stone&#39;s work at the Hole Gallery in New York, Prabal Gurung used a colour-blocking style that sort of invoked Matthew&#39;s brushwork style. I liked the ultra-graphic nature of this collection - black, white and bright red makes for a really striking colour combination, and an interesting collection too - one that we&#39;ll see quite a few things from popping up here and there I think !!
The other thing I have to point out that as a result of a customer&#39;s request, he incorporated stretchy black sections here and there into some of his designs, that made for extra comfort and ease of movementand, and also had figure-shaping effects that wouldn&#39;t have otherwise been there !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">RALPH LAUREN</span></b>
Sadly, Ralph Lauren&#39;s designs don&#39;t get worn on the red carpets very often, but when they do, it&#39;s an event worth mentioning !!
Here his Resort Collection featured an evening-wear story of black, cream and matt gold that was both elegant and sophisticated, and somewhat reminiscent of the late 80s/early 90s New York style, when we were gradually losing the over-emphasis on the power-dressing and big shoulders, thank goodness, and rediscovering the languid fluid styling of the 30s.

Style.com&#39;s reviewer called this collection &#39;<i>regal&#39;</i> and she did have a good point - there is definitely something queenly about her evening-wear designs - gold bullion embroidery on duchess satin and gold beading on sheer gold voile certainly gave everything a bit of sparkle - and I loved most of it, I have to say !! I particularly loved the cobalt blue dress with the waterfall ruffled skirt and gold bullion around the bodice lines - and the duchess satin gown that matched it. Absolutely gorgeous !!
Likewise the navy and white satin gowns with the gold beading splashed up round the waistline, and the shocking pink column gown with the sheer, gold-embroidered cape - truly wonderful stuff !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">TADASHI SHOJI</span></b>
Tadashi Shoji went off to the seaside for his ideas spur this season - look very closely at the black embroidery and lace dresses, and you will start to see the seashells, starfish and other sea-life that he took as his inspiration for his Resort Collection !! I love this kind of thing, and not only because I collect sea-shells myself, and therefore have an affinity with them. I love the fact that these dresses look like simple black lacey dresses, and it&#39;s not until it&#39;s pointed out, or you manage to get a much closer look that you realise they are even there !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">VIONNET</span></b>
Goga Ashkenazi&#39;s design team at Vionnet came out with a really beautiful Resort Collection - with lots of airy light white dresses printed or embroidered with the tracery of dragonfly wings, the whole collection had a summery feel - perfect in fact for a winter holiday in the sun !! The flat sandals helped too. The photoshoot took place on top of a rather futuristic looking building, with swimming-pool blue tiled walls and lots of glass bricks which made it fel like the models had been spirited off to the Med, or somewhere similar !!

Zac gave us an absolutely immaculate, elegant and sophisticated set of evening ball-gowns that had the Oscars written all over them. I loved the last gown with its paper taffeta skirt - what a grand entrance you could make in that !! That is, after all, what Zac&#39;s style and design identity is all about - making the grandest of entrances !!
Other dresses in my pick were slightly less grand, but still beautiful shapes, and effortlessly flattering styles.

So that&#39;s it for my look at the Resort Collections, and guess what ? The July Autumn 2014 Couture Collections are about to start - yes, it&#39;s one long round of fashion stuff - an endless rotation of fashion shows, awards shows, film festivals and premieres, and gala balls - but we love it all...

<span style=""color:#1e252e;""><b><span style=""font-size: 1.8em;"">WHAT THE QUEEN WORE !!</span></b></span>

Royal Ascot has been in progress just this last week, and as usual, there were all manner of beautiful outfits to be seen, and of course, many fun and crazy hats in attendance - so many that I have had to divide them into colour sections !!

Firstly though, I thought I&#39;d do a short post and look at what the Queen wore to this most royal of annual sporting events...

<lj-cut>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">HER MAJESTY QUEEN ELIZABETH II</span></b>
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II attended all five days of Royal Ascot of course, with most members of her immediate family around her. I love to see her outfits and in particular, what jewellery she is wearing - and of course, the colour of her hat is a very popular thing to bet on with the punters !!

Here she is in a pale duck-egg blue coat and print dress outfit with a duck-egg blue hat adorned with a mass of feathers and flowers on the brim. Her hats have to conform to a certain rule - that they have to show her face - no face obscuring brims or down-swept feathers for her !! A long time ago, she set this rule herself, because she has a strong belief that her people should be able to see her face wherever she goes.

</tbody></table>She is also wearing a beautiful brooch: and here I must apologise for the rubbish quality of the close-up - it&#39;s all I could find !!
This brooch is a double swan design featuring what appears to be two large white baroque pearls, trimmed round with many tiny diamonds. According to the TV commentary during the Ascot carriage procession, this brooch was designed by the former Crown Jewellers, G. Collins &amp; Sons, which is the home of Harry Collins, the Queen&#39;s Personal Jeweller and himself a former Crown Jeweller. Interestingly, it is not the only swan brooch in the Queen&#39;s collection; she has at least one other, a tiny diamond swan brooch.
These are quite appropriate for the Queen as, incidentally, the Crown has the rights of ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water, a right only exercised on certain parts of the Thames and its tributaries. This dates back to the 12th Century, when swans were considered a delicacy only fit for royal banquets, and in 1482, Edward IV, who happened to be king at the time, decided that they would be claimed by the Crown, and issued a Royal Charter to that effect !!. Now, the Queen owns by right, all unmarked wild Mute Swans on the River Thames and its tributaries.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">DAY 2 - 18th JUNE</span></b>
On day 2, she appeared in a beautifully subtle eau-de-nil coat with a floral print dress underneath in the same pale pastel grey-green with sprigs of pink, cream, peach and purple flowers, echoed by the same colour flowers in her hat. This is classic Queenie at her best - she is, after all, 88 years old now, but she can still look a gazillion dollars in her own style.

Just have a look at that fabulous flower brooch - again, not a good close-up, but one taken during an earlier wearing.
This made its first appearance during a state visit to France earlier this year. It&#39;s a pretty design of two flowers with different colours of metals and different colours of stones. The top flower has a white centre (most likely to be a small cluster of diamonds) with eight yellow petals. The lower flower has cluster of pink-toned stones at its centre and seven white petals, set in a silver-toned metal. The two gem-set leaves are set in a coloured metal such as rose gold. The brooch could be composed of different colours of diamonds, or there could be different stones in use here. Its history is unknown at this time, though the date of d&eacute;but could indicate a recent gift, possibly for the Diamond Jubilee or another anniversary.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">DAY 3 - 19th JUNE</span></b> <b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">(LADIES DAY)</span></b>
Day 3 was, of course, Ladies Day - a name given to the third day of Ascot, when all the fillies are raced against each other - this has become somewhat better known for the extravagant outfits and crazy hats that are worn by the ladies who attend the races that day !!
Queen Elizabeth wore a gorgeous colour last Thursday&nbsp; - a bright turquoise-blue coat with a matching floral print dress and matching turquoise hat, of course !! I have to say though, that the round-necked shape of this coat and the first day&#39;s pale blue coat are much less flattering for her than the pale green design worn on day 2 - the collar and revers style is a lot more forgiving <i>and</i> we can see a bit of the dress underneath too, as well as the triple-strand pearls she nearly always wears. The fact is that it doesn&#39;t make her look quite so severe and <i>square</i> if you know what I mean. Bear this in mind if you are about to be a Mother-of-the-Bride and rather like the look of this kind of style !!

As on other days, she wore a spectacular brooch - worn by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, mostly in her earlier years, this fabulous 1930s Art Deco brooch contains multiple cuts of aquamarine jewels with diamond accents. The brooch is very much in the style of Cartier from the time, though the maker is unconfirmed. The Queen Mother did commission other pieces from Cartier, so it may well be one of theirs !!. Here she is wearing it back in the 30s, with a spray of flowers stuck in it - how young she looks :-

<i><a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e-gxhoJ0iQU/U6MqBXRUoFI/AAAAAAAAap0/vaB9Xe91-YU/s1600/_qm.jpg"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""320"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e-gxhoJ0iQU/U6MqBXRUoFI/AAAAAAAAap0/vaB9Xe91-YU/s1600/_qm.jpg"" width=""236"" /></a></i>

It is designed in what looks like a possible double-clip style - referred to as a &#39;<i>duette</i>&#39; brooch, where the two dress clips attach to a frame with a pin on the back to form a brooch, and a centre stone to cover the join, although I have never seen this one worn as a pair of clips. The brooch apparently passed to the Queen on her mother&#39;s death in 2002, and to the best of my knowledge, we see her wearing it for the first time publicly at Ascot this year. I personally love this beautiful item, and I hope she wears it often.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">DAY 4</span></b> <b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">- 20th JUNE</span></b>
On day 4, with Ladies Day behind her, the Queen didn&#39;t let up on her style - this was a fabulous bright pink coat with a floral print dress underneath again - a somewhat perennial style for the Queen during the Summer months !! This kind of thing suits her though - she definitely knows her own style and never&nbsp; has a hair out of place.

A word about the somewhat surprisingly modern design of her brooch - the Queen was presented with this brooch representing Saskatchewan during an audience with the province&#39;s Lieutenant Governor on October 17, 2013. From Saskatchewan designer Rachel Mielke of Hillberg &amp; Berk, it&#39;s an 18K white gold brooch in the shape of a flower with five petals of Madagascar tourmaline in shades of pink with a central white fresh water cultured pearl, all surrounded by 300 diamonds (1.527 carats in all). The brooch is valued at $15,000 and was gifted by Hillberg &amp; Berk. The designer said that she spent a month studying the Queen&#39;s wardrobe to create something that would be a good fit, and that the tourmaline was already on hand, having been part of a larger purchase. After presenting the Queen with her new brooch, Lieutenant Governor Vaughan Solomon Schofield reported the monarch had gasped, smiled, and inspected her new jewel in detail. The remainder of the batch of Madagascar tourmaline that yielded the Queen&#39;s brooch has been turned into the Legacy Collection, available on the Hilberg &amp; Berk website.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">DAY 5 - 21st JUNE</span></b>
The last day of Royal Ascot saw the Queen in fine form, wearing a pale dusky-pink coat and floral print dress in shades of charcoal-grey, dusky-pink and white, with a beautiful hat in matching pink, of course, with a huge flat tailored side-bow - very smart and crisp-looking !! Again, I would have liked this coat to have a V-shape at the front, whether it&#39;s a tailored collar and revers or perhaps an open collar like she wore on Day 2, or maybe no collar at all - we could see the print better !!...

Her brooch this time was a beautiful double flower in peachy-pink stones edged in diamonds down the stem, and forming the leaves. What a beauty this is, and not one I&#39;ve seen before...maybe this was a present on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee recently.

Queen Elizabeth put on a great show as she always does, and she wore some beautiful jewels to boot. I am considering making this a regular &#39;Royal Jewel&#39; post over on my jewellery blog at WordPress here :-

The Resort Collections for 2015 have been showing all over the place during the last month or so - in New York, London, Paris and Milan, they have been holding shows in various forms, mainly photo-shoots, small-scale runway shows, and quite a few launch parties for good measure !! I decided to catch up on the best of the red carpet evening-wear and cocktail/party-wear for the coming season, for your perusal - so this is Part 1, including collection highlights from Alberta Ferretti, Badgley Mischka, Bibhu Mohapatra, Carolina Herrera, Chanel (shown above), Dior, Elie Saab, Erdem, Jenny Packham, and a few other relatively new and interesting names - so let&#39;s see who wears what from this little lot...
<lj-cut>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ALBERTA FERRETTI</span></b>
Alberta Ferretti went all out for beautiful colours this season - a gorgeous mouth-watering palette of magenta pink, purple, lilac, lime green and orange !! She created a ditzy floral print that hailed straight from the 1960s and devised a beautiful swirling &#39;70s flavour motif in sequins and blocks of colour in jacquards and embroidery - truly a rich texture and colour fiesta for a winter sun holiday. I particularly loved the short dresses with their fun and sassy looks, the laser-cut lace panels with sheer backing, and the blocks of rich berry shades - this was a gorgeous collection, and one which is sure to appear on the red carpet many times over - I do hope so !!
Here are my own favourites from it - so many to choose from too...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">BADGLEY MISCHKA</span></b>
The design duo at the heart of this brand, Mark Badgley and James Mischka admitted they were so bored with the winter climate that they went off to Tahiti and Bora-Bora for a break, and to seek inspiration - that they got in the shape of jungly prints, and embroidered Hibiscus flower motifs, adorned with lots of fancy stones and braiding. This was a much sleeker collection than usual - not so many frills as they usually indulge in, and I like it all the more for that !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">BIBHU MOHAPATRA</span></b>
Hollywood&#39;s favourite for a lot of stars, Bibhu was inspired by a talk given by colour-blind artist Neil Harbisson about how a new device allowed him to hear colours instead of seeing them in the conventional sense, and decided to challenge himself to cut most of the colour element out of his collection, and just concentrate on a grey-scale - however, as you can see, there was a certain amount of flexibility within that self-imposed restriction - blue, for instance, didn&#39;t seem to be a colour that was forbidden !!
He also concentrated on a really nice silhouette print of a floral vine which looked so <i>utterly</i> different when printed in silver on blue from when it was printed in black on grey - you couldn&#39;t believe it was the same print.
<i>&quot;I wanted to develop a print from some element in nature,&quot;</i> is how he explained this design.
My favourite from this little lot was the periwinkle and cobalt blur dress with the floating halter-neck and the amazing double star-pleated skirt.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CALVIN KLEIN COLLECTION</span></b>
Not a lot of evening dresses in the Calvin Klein Collection, however I really liked these four designs for a bit of an arty party !! They have a distinctive late 60s Chelsea vibe about them, which was enhanced by the plastic see-through boots !! Chief Designer Francisco Costa came out with a stunningly and refreshingly honest statement about this collection:
&quot;<i>Short, above-the-knee lengths sell well for the company - we imagine the average height of an American woman is 5&#39;10&quot;. Well, it isn&#39;t - it&#39;s 5&#39;4, and short lengths work well for her !!&quot;.</i>
Yes, indeed...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CAROLINA HERRERA</span></b>
More floral silhouette prints from Carolina Herrera in this collection, this time in varying shades of blue, yellow ochre and peppermint green on black. The other dresses I picked were all monochrome black and white - very pretty though and sophisticated too - in fact, the only dress I <i>didn&#39;t </i>pick, because I found the giant flowers on the peppermint green background just a tad overwhelming - is the one that I suspect will be worn on the first red carpet after this show !! Sod&#39;s Law...,

Lovely, <i>lovely</i> collection from Uncle Karl...rich ethnic floral prints in a riot of colours, featuring lots of generously full and slightly Asian-looking shapes, teamed with amazing big 1970s-style hair, designed by Sam McKnight, and lots of Tibetan silver. This was a show that Style.com described thus:
&quot;<i>...the clothes Lagerfeld showed left the impression of something you might actually imagine a hundred years ago, when Paul Poiret&#39;s injection of Eastern exoticism freed fashionable Parisians from the restrictions of the 19th century...</i>.&quot;
Yes - exactly that !! There was more than a hint of the Poiret&#39;s about this beautiful and richly exotic collection, of which Karl himself said:
&quot;<i>This is my idea of a romantic, modern Orient, a new One Thousand and One Nights.&quot;</i>

The show started out with all the floral prints on silk organza and developed into something much more intricate and beautiful - sheer floaty prints featuring the rich Islamic mosaic tiling you see on mosques and beautiful jewelled crescent moons in their hair paid tribute to the city hosting this show - Dubai.
This is the most utterly modern of cities, featuring an amazingly futuristic skyline, which Karl took as a starting point for sequin embroidery around the hem of a couple of plain black shift-dresses over harem-trousers - the last two photos here.
Gorgeous stuff indeed - I might even post a bit of a piece about the jewellery in this show, over in my newish jewellery blog, as it was so stunning !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CHRISTIAN DIOR</span></b>
Raf Simons brought out a simply <i>superb</i> collection for Dior, with plain but brilliant colours, and using intricate lace in many designs, and dresses featuring sections of brilliantly coloured abstract prints against plain black really stood out. These prints largely came from the archive scarf collection mainly with a few new ones that were designed for the collection itself.
I must admit that when Raf Simons was appointed as Artistic Director at Dior, I was very doubtful that he would be my cup of tea. After the avant-garde outrageously flamboyant style of John Galliano, I couldn&#39;t really see that it was perhaps time for a different, and more modern, cleaner vision at Dior - however, now that he&#39;s settled in, I am starting to<i> get</i> his vision at last !! I liked this collection a lot and will be keeping my eye open for any of these on the red carpet.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ELIE SAAB</span></b>
The palest of pastel hues combined with some interesting prints, and richer colours, and more range of silhouettes made this collection from Elie Saab a lot more appealing to me - he is concentrating a lot more on more casual shapes, like tunics, trousers, shifts, and T-shirts, all with the same luxe treatment as his evening-wear - rich embroidery, prints and sequins all create an interesting look. Of course, he also brought out loads of fine and covetable evening dresses, the best of which are here:

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ERDEM</span></b>
Erdem Moralioglu brought out a very interesting Resort collection this time - a somewhat subverted version of his usual ladylike style - pretty floral prints with ruffles and lace were all present and correct, but in addition, he experimented with a much more haphazard finish, almost ragged edged, with one of the best paint-splashed floral prints, and a very casual approach to the shoes, all of which imparted a slightly rough look to everything, including the artist&#39;s studio where the photo-shoot was staged.
I liked the black-backed dress and blouse with layers of white ruffles down the front in particular - very unusual !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">GIAMBATTISTA VALLI</span></b>
Giambattista Valli&#39;s Resort Collection was very, very pretty - again, in common with a lot of other designers, there were lots of florals, most notably the gorgeous bright pink and red petal-print which decorated several looks, and in combination with the plain white dress trimmed with red lips around the waist and the plain red dress with frills down the sides - all great little red carpet looks for the film premi&egrave;res and more casual parties that crop up throughout the year.
The black and white designs and the yellow floral print on white were both good stories too. There was a bit of a late &#39;70s vibe going on here too, with flared trousers and wafty long dresses with cape sleeves, and plenty of little mini-dresses.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HALSTON HERITAGE</span></b>
Here&#39;s an interesting new label - well, not so new for those of us with long memories !! This is of course, the company founded by one of the best US fashion designers of the 20th Century - Roy Halston. He was famous chiefly, I suppose, for designing that iconic pillbox hat worn by Jackie Kennedy at JFK&#39;s inauguration ceremony, for which he became an overnight sensation. He became the favourite of most of the notable film stars, models and entertainers of the 1970s and 80s - Liza Minnelli, Anjelica Huston, Bianca Jagger, Lauren Hutten, Lauren Bacall and Elizabeth Taylor, to name but a few. He was linked to Andy Warhol and his coterie as a regular at the iconic New York nightclub, Studio 54 in the 1980s, and he was responsible for starting a lot of the best trends of the late 70s and early 80s.
Now, the company produces ranges and collections in the best of the Halston style, getting a lot of inspiration from the house archive. The chief designer there is Marie Mazelis, who was the former creative director of Max Azria and Herv&eacute; L&eacute;ger until two years ago, when she was appointed to this post. This is their first Resort Collection and includes some of the most beautiful designs of the season, in my view. I love the gorgeous kaftan shapes, one of the biggest trends that Roy Halston created, and I also love the first dress I&#39;ve picked out here, in layers of gunmetal grey and black.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HONOR</span></b>
Another new name to me, and one which I was inspired to go and find out about when I saw the <i>gorgeous</i> sky-blue dress with periwinkle-blue chiffon flowers at the neck, worn by Jess Weixler to the amfAR Gala in Cannes a few weeks back !! I liked her dress so much that I just had to go and see what else this designer has done. The designer in question is Giovanna Randall, and she didn&#39;t disappoint - the Resort Collectionm had a number of pretty florals, which seems to be the biggest trend this season, and some rather innovative design ideas with regards to sleeve structure amongst other things. Here are the best designs I picked out, so we shall see whether this design brand has caught any other eyes ...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JENNY PACKHAM</span></b>
If there seems to be a slight flavour of the Orient on my choices from Jenny Packham&#39;s Resort Collection, the reason for that is that her inspiration was Ang Lee&#39;s 2007 thriller, <em>Lust, Caution</em>, which is set in China in the late thirties and early forties !!
<i>&quot;I was inspired by the idea of presenting a collection of evening-wear that fused traditional Far Eastern style with Western fashions,&quot;</i> she said to Lauren Sherman at Style.com. The East meets West thing was extremely subtle though, but the result was, in the end, a fantastically commercial selection of evening-wear, which will possibly result in many red carpet hits for this journal - I hope so, as she is one of my favourite red carpet designers !! Thus, there are lots to choose from...

Yes indeed - all beautiful stuff !!
So what did <i>you</i> think of this selection and how many of these do you think will turn up on the red carpets of the Autumn? The Grammys and the other main music awards shows are then, for the most part, so it will be interesting to see - out of this whole post and the Resort Collections part 2 post, how many dresses make an appearance.

Part 2 will be up after I take a quick detour to Royal Ascot !!

Catching up on the rest of the Cannes Film Festival 2014, here are my Top 20 Best and Worst Dressed picks of the evening. This was held at the <i>superbly</i> ostentatious Hotel du Cap Eden Roc, in the Cap d&#39;Antibes, just down the coast from Cannes, in the South of France...
<lj-cut>

This is a huge hotel used by Karl Lagerfeld to stage his Resort Collection, back in 2012, and probably on other occasions too, I expect. It&#39;s a gorgeous bit of real estate, involving a French stately home and an avenue of palm trees leading to a modern waterside pool complex, many cocktail bars and restaurants and a\ massive ball room for events such as this !! You can tell from the hotel&#39;s logo that it&#39;s going to be expensive - just look at the great aerial shot below..

Poolside dining and lounging, looking out over the bay - fabulous !!

This is the 21st Gala ball in aid of the fight against AIDS, held by amfAR, during the Cannes Film Festival and it&#39;s fast becoming an annual fixture in the diary of the festival, even though it&#39;s not officially part of the actual timetable itself. Many stars attend this of course, because it&#39;s clearly the place to see and be seen - there is a huge auction for the charity, involving Bulgari jewels, holidays, and many other goodies donated by various companies, and there is much star entertainment too, dancing, eating and drinking, and partying !!
I have discovered that the total money raised by this Gala ball, and charity auction came to a whopping total of $51.9 Million US Dollars - wow<i> (*collective gasps)</i> that&#39;s a lot of dosh !!
The auction alone raised US$35 Million...included in the auction was a Damien Hirst work &#39;<i>Gone But Not Forgotten</i>&#39;, a 3 meter high gilded woolly mammoth skeleton preserved in a huge glass case which went for $15 million on its own. Also up for sale was a Virgin Atlantic flight into space for $1 million and a Bulgari Serpenti necklace, in white gold with a 13 ct of drop-shape aquamarine and 19&middot;2 ct of pav&eacute; diamonds, which sold for US$550,000.
Crazy stuff !!
Regarding the outfits worn to this event, as this event took place about two and a half weeks ago I wanted to keep this fairly short and sweet, but I had a bit of a hard time keeping this down to just twenty choices for both sections <i>in total</i>. However it was actually great discipline for me - it meant I really had to think about each choice !! Inevitably, this will mean that you may not agree with some of my choices, but bear in mind that for the twenty listed here, there were about another fifty dresses in the wings that didn&#39;t quite make the list !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">BEST DRESSED</span></b>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">AISHWARYA RAI</span></b>
Aishwarya Rai continued her run of totally amazing looks with this beautiful two tiered gown from the Armani Priv&eacute; Autumn 2013 Collection. I love the illusion of the bodice standing out on its own here - you have to look pretty close before you realise it&#39;s mounted onto a sheer layer that goes over her shoulders ! I also love the floaty top layer with the fitted skirt skimming over her hips and flaring out from underneath - extremely flattering for whatever shape you happen to be - this would pretty much suit everyone. Keep this kind of shape in mind if you are stuck for knowing what suits you when looking for that illusive evening dress look !!

She really has it made in the glorious locks department, doesn&#39;t she ?!! Her hair always looks <i>fabulous</i> - glossy, thick, and beautifully styled. I love her gorgeous diamond earrings - is it just the one or is she harbouring another matching one under her hair ? All round, a great look and one that deserves a big Gold Star, I think.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ALESSANDRA AMBROSIO</span></b>
Alessandro went with that perennial favourite, Roberto Cavalli for this event, and this is a typical design for him - sexy, glamorous and semi-revealing !! You have to be tall and willowy to wear his designs well, I think, as they always seem to feature a long side slit and at least one section of bared flesh, usually more than one,
She looks great in this, especially with the bright red lipstick, and the side-swept hair. I also liked her beautiful diamond necklace, probably on loan but who cares ?!!

<img alt=""Alessandra Ambrosio 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/976946/976946_600.jpg"" title=""Alessandra Ambrosio 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Alessandra Ambrosio 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/977262/977262_600.jpg"" title=""Alessandra Ambrosio 02"" />

The back view is beautiful too but you have to have perfect skin everywhere !! No room for imperfections here...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">COCO ROCHA</span></b>
Top model, Coco really stood out in this eye-catching black and white striped rise-and-fall gown, designed by Olga Sorokina for Maison Irfe. Not everyone will like this but that&#39;s a sign of something a bit more daring in my view - I mean, these stripes are really attention-grabbing, and the rise bit is not to everyone&#39;s taste, I must admit. I like it though, as she looks fab in it and really pulls it off. Her cat&#39;s eye make-up, ultra-short bob and bright red lipstick are all perfect for this rather Pop-art design. It smacks of the 1960s and her styling is spot-on.
The only jarring bit is the multi-strand chain necklace - a bit superfluous, methinks !! No gold star then, but a great outfit nonetheless...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CONCHITA WURST</span></b>
For those of you who have no idea who the Hell this is, this is Conchita, the Austrian Eurovision entry who won the hearts and minds of Europe, striking a right-on blow for all LGBT singers everywhere !! Conchita is a man actually, of course, but who cares - she has the most fabulous voice, and I like to think that&#39;s why she won the Eurovision Song Contest, but I know better than that. Who says that a man in drag shouldn&#39;t sport a goodly beard ?!! And why not...
However, that&#39;s by the way - the real reason she is in my list is because I am loving her beautiful deep-teal sequinned, bias-cut gown - fabulous on anyone with a slim build, and God knows, Our Conchita is slim !!
Frankly, I admire anyone who dares to make us all question our own ideals of beauty !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">DITA VON TEESE</span></b>
The day Dita doesn&#39;t look fabulously and immaculately groomed, and dressed up to the nines as if she was about to meet the Queen, is the day I give this up, frankly !! She looks like she has just stepped out of a very expensive 1940s designer lingerie and nightwear catalogue - I mean this whole outfit has a distinctly boudoir feel to it, which suits her whole persona perfectly !! She sticks very much to her own semi-burlesque style on the red carpet, and always looks amazing as a result !!

<img alt=""Dita Von Teese 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/978711/978711_600.jpg"" title=""Dita Von Teese 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Dita Von Teese 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/979140/979140_600.jpg"" title=""Dita Von Teese 02"" /> &nbsp; <span style=""font-size:1.0em;""><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v449/wendylady1/Fashion%20Police/GoldStar02.jpg"" /></span>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">GINTA LAPINA</span></b>
Ginta is a Latvian model, and has walked in many runway shows including Dolca &amp; Gabbana, Oscar de la Renta, Prada, Marc Jacobs, Vivienne Westwood, Versace, and many others !! Here, she chose a gorgeous deep-teal and bronze embroidered gown designed by Marchesa from their Autumn 2013 Collection. I&#39;m annoyed that I didn&#39;t pick this one out when I featured my choices from this collection, but hey-ho - their collections are so chock full of wonderful dresses, that it&#39;s difficult to pick out just seven or eight !!
The dress really suits her figure of course, and I really love all that rich bronze-coloured embroidery everywhere !! However, I&#39;m not that enamoured with her make-up - this slightly shiny-faced, no-lipstick look makes you look a teensy bit sickly, as if you are running a high temperature - don&#39;t you think ?!! Add to the illusion the fact that her hair looks a bit damp, and there you go !! For that reason, and that reason alone, she misses out on the Gold Star...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JANE FONDA</span></b>
La Fonda is still looking fabulous in this beautiful gown from Atelier Versace - glamorous and still sexy after all these years - Jane is still knocking &#39;em dead on the red carpet !! This is a gorgeous colour for her actually, and the dress itself is figure-hugging, but still covered up which is appropriate for her age. She really does look amazing, doesn&#39;t she ?!!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JESS WEIXLER</span></b>
I love this gorgeous pale ice-blue dress of many layers, with its frothy neck-piece of sheer petals, instead of a necklace&nbsp; - what a beauty this is !! This was designed by Giovanna Randall for the &#39;Honor&#39; label, which I confess is a new name to me - I went and had a look at her show which this came from and she had some really nice design therein. Perhaps this is a label I should watch out for...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JESSICA CHASTAIN</span></b>
Jessica Chastain looked sensational of course, which is what we&#39;ve come to expect from her !! She didn&#39;t let me down with this beautiful black sculpted gown from Ricardo Tisci at Givenchy - this was a custom Couture gown and so will not appear in any collections. In addition to the dress, she wore this amazing diamond necklace, designed by Tesiro, featuring flowers and leaves in an intricate design, which definitely needed a plain black gown to show it off. She looks great in black with her red hair and fair skin, and the diamonds really suit her well.This is definitely a Gold Star-worthy look...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MORAN ATIAS</span></b>
Moran Atias chose a strapless black gown with an intricate lace overlay which features a pattern which reminds of Indian shawls somehow...it&#39;s gorgeous and suits her brilliantly !!
I love her beautiful necklace too - usually I&#39;m not that big on pendants, but this one is really pretty. Her make-up is perfect for this event - well-defined but not overly heavy - my favourite type of make-up look on the red carpet !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">NADJA BENDER</span></b>
Nadja Bender chose, or was chosen to wear this beautiful dress from the Gucci Spring 2014 Collection - this is the first dress that I chose as well, when I looked at Milan Fashion Week last September. Therefore, I include it here as she looks every bit as good in it, at this party situation as she did on the runway...

<img alt=""Nadja Bender 01"" height=""600"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/983181/983181_600.jpg"" title=""Nadja Bender 01"" width=""400"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Nadja Bender 02"" height=""600"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/983414/983414_600.jpg"" title=""Nadja Bender 02"" width=""400"" />

Yes - here she is wearing the very same dress on the Gucci runway back in the September show !! I bet she liked it so much that she volunteered to wear it out at Cannes for them, because, make no mistake, an event like this is a <i>massive</i> advertising opportunity for all the fashion brands, and it&#39;s the main reason there are so many models walking round the place as well as actors. Anyway, this is a good call for Nadja, as she looks great in it !! The print design on the front has a real Glasgow School of Art style, Art Nouveau feel to it - a kind of homage to Charles Rennie-Mackintosh, although the Style.com review said that the designer Frida Giannini was inspired by the Art Nouveau designs of Ert&eacute;. Either way, it&#39;s a thing of beauty, and I love the easy kimono styling and the broad bands edging the skirt.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">POLINA MARGASOVA</span></b>
Model Polina Margasova chose this beautiful rich green / yellow shot silk organza halter-necked gown, edged in broad gold brocade, printed with a crocodile-skin texture !! I don&#39;t know who designed this, but she is the best friend of Eva Cavalli, wife of designer Roberto, so on an educated guess basis, this may be by him !! She looks fab in it with her hair tumbling in a mass of wet-look curls, and that sun-glow that you can&#39;t help but get when you&#39;ve been in in Cannes for more than a week...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ROSIE HUNTINGDON-WHITELY</span></b>
The second to last in my Best Dressed list is Rosie Huntingdon-Whitely, looking fabulous in a deep saffron-yellow design by Peter Dundas for the Autumn 2014 Emilio Pucci Collection. Normally, I&#39;m not a great one for yellow, but this is simply gorgeous, and she is wearing it well because she also has that Cannes sun-kissed glow !! Whether it&#39;s from the actual sun or from a bottle, she looks great - a tan does away with the need for heavy make-up on the red carpet, so she just has eye shadow and a touch of tinted lip gloss.
I love this casual style, in a rather Grecian manner - it&#39;s great for the more formal events in a summer destination like Cannes - so she gets a Gold Star from me...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">IZABEL GOULART</span></b>
Oh my - this is just<i> gorgeous !!</i> Fabulous gown, designed by Peter Dundas for Emilio Pucci, gives her a truly fairy-tale look !! Perfectly flawless make-up - not too heavy, but well-defined, and a plain and simple little string of diamonds giving her just a touch of sparkle - all very understated, which of course, the best looks often are !!
I am guessing this is a special design just for her as it&#39;s not in any of the runway collections, although it could be a first look at something from the coming Resort 2015 Collection perhaps.
Anyway, I am awarding Izabel my rather coveted Gold Crown for the being the Belle of the Ball...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">WORST DRESSED</span></b>
Now on to the Worst Dressed list - quite a few made it into my shortlist - more than usual, I must say...so I had a hard time getting this down to a reasonable six or so...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">IRINA SHAYK</span></b>
Irina chose this rather strange design from Atelier Versace, with a one-shoulder polo-necked over-dress rather in the style of Grace Jones - remember her ?!! This has that thing with the one sleeve going on that I really hate the look of - it always looks like one sleeve has been chopped off to me - fine if the neckline goes diagonally across the front, but if it&#39;s like this, it looks a bit one-sided...
Frankly, I would have vastly preferred this if it had had just the beaded strapless gown on its own - the whole gown looks awkward and perhaps ripped open, as if the jersey has been snagged on a nail on the way out !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KATI NESCHER</span></b>
I hate this awful dress with a passion - it doesn&#39;t do anything for her, so goodness knows what possessed her to choose this dreadful design. Why is it on everyone&#39;s best dressed list when it clearly doesn&#39;t even fit that well - it looks awkward and cheap, far too shiny and it looks like it&#39;s pulling all over the place - and then she finishes it off with an over-sized pendant that looks like it weighs a ton...hmm, bad styling all round really !!.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LARA STONE</span></b>
Lara went one better than anyone else with this vintage Gianni Versace outift, which, I&#39;m afraid is exactly what this looks like - a leftover from the 1980s, but not in a good way !! It&#39;s far too <i>costumey</i>, if you know what I mean - like a belly dancer&#39;s outfit !! Typical of Gianni&#39;s style, it&#39;s overblown, over-gilded and totally over the top. See, Gianni Versace wasn&#39;t always the designer everyone remembers and loves.
Donnatella may have been the best thing that happened to the Versace brand in my opinion...

<img alt=""X Lara Stone 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/986800/986800_600.jpg"" title=""X Lara Stone 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""X Lara Stone 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/987119/987119_600.jpg"" title=""X Lara Stone 02"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">OLGA SOROKINA</span></b>
This is Olga Sorokina, the designer responsible for the black and white stripy ensemble that Coco Rocha was wearing at this event. That was a great outfit, but this is a bit too gimmicky for me. That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t like a bit of surrealism every now and then, but the tape measure on the front of this jacket looks a bit too large for the design, and the front is way too open for decency, to my mind. Too much boobage on show...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SAHAR BINIAZ</span></b>
Now then - who, in their right mind, wears a hat - <i>a hat</i> - to a party ?!! This looks like she is trying far too hard, wasn&#39;t sure what to wear, and went over the top just to make sure she wasn&#39;t under-dressed !! Sahar is actually the winner of the Miss Canada title, and apparently wears a little hat to most things as far as I can make out. Trademark it might be, but it still looks daft !!
The dress is great, but don&#39;t get me started on the shoes...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SVETLANA MEKINA</span></b>
Svetlana chose this weird dress just to keep me happy, I think !! Again, an awkward one-shouldered, one-sleeved design that doesn&#39;t really work. At least this one has the diagonal neckline that looks a bit less strange. However, her left shoulder looks a tad deformed under all that bulk, and although I totally get the one earring thing, and one-sided hair to off-set the sleeve on the other side, this doesn&#39;t really work, does it ?!!

<img alt=""X Svetlana Metkina 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/988312/988312_600.jpg"" title=""X Svetlana Metkina 01"" /> &nbsp; <img alt=""X Svetlana Metkina 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/988485/988485_600.jpg"" title=""X Svetlana Metkina 02"" />

There were almost a hundred other outifts that didn&#39;t quite get into this post, so if there was one that you really, really loved, or one that you really, really hated, that I haven&#39;t covered - do please tell us all about it - your comments can include photos if you know how...

Come and see my newest lot of jewellery items for sale over at e-Bay now that their new rules for listings have come into force. The new rule is your first 20 items listed for free, no matter what their starting price may be&nbsp; - after that you start paying !!
Plenty of people are objecting like mad that their &#39;<i>first 100 x 99p items listed for free&#39;</i> facility has been taken away, but for me it means that there will be much less cheap stuff cluttering up the listings - and there was plenty of cheap stuff, let me tell you. Now people are listing those items as mixed lots instead, and the general quality of items for sale will go up, and for me anyway, that will be a good thing !!

<lj-cut>
Come and see some of the first 20 items that I have put up this week:

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">NAPIER - GOLD / BLACK BIB NECKLACE - 1980s</span></b>

<img alt=""IMG_3258 (640x427)"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/972787/972787_600.jpg"" title=""IMG_3258 (640x427)"" />

Big, bold &amp;beautiful - look at this gorgeous bib necklace - dating from the 1980s, this is signed on the reverse with the Napier signature, and is made of the best quality chunky gold-tone metal with black enamel stripes inserted along the centre-piece. This centrepiece measures 6.5cms long and is 2cms wide in the middle, tapering down to 1cm at each end. The chain is a flat snake chain with beautifully sinewy links, and a flat secure catch at the back. The whole necklace measures around 40cms long when opened out flat, so the front section sits comfortably just below your throat.

Here&#39;s what I learned about this brand:-

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">NAPIER</span></b>
The Napier company originated as E.A. Bliss, back in 1875 - the company produced ornate belt buckles, hair pieces, match-safes and chatelaines. Over 125 years, the firm that became known as The Napier Co. in 1922 made thousands of necklaces, bracelets, brooches and earrings too: Everything from frilly sterling silver filigree and modernist gold-plated metalwork to jewelry with beads, crystals, Catalin, and charms.
During its Golden Age in the 1950s, Napier put out everything from a subdued line of &ldquo;tailored&rdquo; jewellery to countless numbers of bombastic pieces that might be modernist abstractions, mid-century kitsch, or explosions of Rococo frippery.

&ldquo;Much of Napier&rsquo;s jewellery was considered avant-garde at the time,&rdquo; Lewis says. &ldquo;All of its designers were artists first. And they had complete freedom to design what they wanted before they presented it to the team. The designers weren&rsquo;t instructed to create within a particular genre, and that&rsquo;s why Napier had so many different looks. Napier&rsquo;s process was more organic, stemming from the individual jewellery designer.&rdquo;

( A big thank you to Lisa Hix for this information, from her article on Collector&#39;s Weekly website )

So there you have it - come and bid on this amazing piece - you know you want to !!

Here is a superb, 1980s Demi-parure consisting of a necklace with matching earrings, with posts for pierced ears. The necklace features a gorgeous curvy motif with rich turquoise-blue-green enamel striped with the gold, and a satisfyingly heavy quality to it - have a look at the photos to get an idea of how long it is and where it sits when on - like many necklaces from this eras, it is big and bold and sits just below your throat - quite short, but great for semi-low necklines as it sits above them. The necklace measures 41 cms from end to end and the turquoise motif measures 4.5 cms x 1.7cms at its widest point.
The earrings are striped like the necklace, and are equally big and bold - a perfect 1980s set.
This set is signed with the letters IV, like the Roman numeral for 4, however, I have no idea what this stands for, or who made this - if anyone has any information about this, I would be delighted if you could let me know !!
I also have another just like this but in a deep rusty peachy-orange colour - come and see my listings if you fancy a pop at both !!

Beautiful stuff !!

I also have several beautiful brooches for sale - like this gorgeous Art Deco item - I have two of these:-

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">1960s MONET - ART DECO-STYLE BAR BROOCH - GOLD-TONE / PAV&Eacute; DIAMANT&Eacute;</span></b>

This was a tremendously popular bar brooch designed by Monet back in the 60s and continued in production for a good decade or so - thus the reason why there are so many around in the second-hand vintage market !! I have two of these for sale, so if you like it, come and bid on both of these auctions - you never know - you might win one for yourself to wear, and one to resell on...
It measures 7.5cms long x 1.4cms wide and has two hearts back to back, set with clear rhinestones - a truly attractive piece !! It is signed with the copyright symbol and &#39;MONET&#39; on&nbsp; the back.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">1950s FLAT COLLAR-STYLE NECKLACE</span></b>

Here is a wonderful example of a 1950s/60s era flat collar-style necklace in brushed gold-tone metal, popularised by Trifari, and Monet !! This one is unsigned and measures approx 37 cms in length with several extra length options in the chain at the back.
A fine necklace for that &#39;Mad Men&#39; early1960s look...

Here&#39;s another:-

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">1950s BSK - HUGE ABSTRACT GOLD-TONE BROOCH</span></b>

<img alt=""IMG_3388 (640x427)"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/975708/975708_600.jpg"" title=""IMG_3388 (640x427)"" />

Gloriously huge brooch - signed by the BSK brand, and probably from the 1950s, judging by the brushed finish and abstract design - see info re: the BSK brand below.
This wonderful vintage brooch measures a full 5cms across the diameter, and domes up 2cms in the middle, with feather-like ribs radiating out from the spiral at the centre. It has a secure roll-over clasp and is in perfect condition.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">BSK JEWELLERY</span></b>
Not that much is known about the BSK brand, so here is what I have found out :-

The company was founded in New York in 1948 and was in business until the mid 1980s. The letters BSK stand for the first initials of the three owners: Benny Steinberg, Slovitt and Kaslo. Other sources state that the B. Steinberg-Kaslo Co. was composed of partners Julius Steinberg, Morris Kimmelman, Hyman Slovitt, Abraham J. Slovitt, Samuel Friedman and another entity called Arke Inc. This info comes from the text of a 1956 copyright infringement lawsuit between Trifari and B.S.K. Who copied whom ? We don&#39;t know, but I would be willing to bet that Trifari was the injured party here...
BSK jewellery was very good quality. The designs sold well in the 1950s, when the demand for affordable jewellery boomed after the war time rationing period. Many of their designs were of the typical brushed gold-tone finish so popular at the time with Trifari and other designers. (This brooch here is in a brushed gold-tone finish.)The BSK line was reasonably priced and was sold in department stores such as Woolworths.

That&#39;s just a few of the wonderful items I have currently up for sale&nbsp; - these auctions end next Saturday so do come and have a look :-

This will be my last post for about ten days as I&#39;m off to Cornwall for my annual holiday with my Mum - her native land, Cornwall, and as she is the last of her family left now, it&#39;s a regular trip I try to take every year with her - for her, it&#39;s going home. Therefore, Cannes will have to take a bit of a back-seat for just over a week. For now, I am taking a look at days 7 and 8 : three premi&egrave;res and loads of marvellous dresses !!

<lj-cut>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">DAY 7 : &#39;TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT&#39;</span></b>
Directed by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardennes, this French film stars Marion Cotillard in the lead role and Fabrizio Rongione, two of their favourite actors. The story line goes like this :
Sandra ( Marion Cotillard) stands a chance of losing her job. In order to save her position, she tries to convince her colleagues to give up their bonus, but this financial extra is anything but a luxury for these poor workers. Time is of the essence: she only has a weekend, two days and one night, to do it. Her husband, Manu, is of great help to her in this race. Manu, the character played by Fabrizio, who is a little trade-unionist and very much in love, does all he can to encourage his wife. He is the only glimmer of hope in a situation which seems insurmountable for Sandra.

Quite a few stars on this red carpet, including Marion of course, but she didn&#39;t make it into my Best Dressed lists - instead you can see what she opted to wear later on...
For now, let&#39;s take a look at the good stuff !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">AISHWARYA RAI</span></b>
Aishwarya went with this fabulous gold dress designed by Roberto Cavalli, and of course looked a million dollars in it !! This type of fishtail wiggle dress really suits her curvy figure and she really plays it to the hilt - gorgeous hair and make-up, and matching red nails and lips really brought her to our attention at this event !! (She&#39;s not the first person to wear this design - Kristen Chenoweth wore this dress to the Oscars this year, but didn&#39;t get into my Best Dressed final list, although she nearly did - she was in the initial top 40.)

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ALESSANDRA AMBROSIO</span></b>
Model Alessandro looked fabulous in this white Atelier Versace dress with one shoulder and oodles of strings across the back view - what an interesting and complex design !! Great dress though...
She went the whole hog with make-up and hair - I loved the high ponytail wrapped with a section of her own hair, and the <i>amazing</i> statement earrings - there&#39;s nothing like a good pair of sparklers !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ELEONORA BOCCARIA</span></b>
Eleonora went to French designer Christophe Guillarm&eacute; for this pretty peachy dress - I loved the high Empire-line design, set off with jewels under the bust-line. I also love the fact that it&#39;s strapless, but not particularly revealing. I&#39;m also liking the peachy-coloured shell-slice ring and the gold-beaded clutch - all very tasteful and very pretty indeed !!.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ELSA ZYLBERSTEIN</span></b>
French film, TV and stage actress, Elsa is a regular attendee at Cannes - every year, she can be seen on the red carpets at this festival, and she is always looking great !! Here, she is wearing a beautiful sea-green embroidered silk muslin dress designed by Zuhair Murad, which looks amazing !! I love this, but I&nbsp; really wish she had matched her bag to the colour of the dress...black is a tad boring for a dress like this !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LIU WEN</span></b>
Liu Wen looked simply stunning in this black column dress with huge black belt and frilled bodice - what a fabulous look !! She realy turned heads in this actually, and I think it was the unusual shape of the bodice combined with the simplcity of the whole look all together - from the statement drop earrings right down to the black toe-nail varnish - all great stuff !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">PETRA NEMCOVA</span></b>
Petra turned up in a fabulous red carpet gown, featuring lots of black and lots of sequins and beading !! Also from Zuhair Mured, this time from the Spring 2014 Couture Collection - this time though, I picked this dress too, so Petra and I get stars each !! She gets a big Gold one for looking sensational, and I get one for having such great taste...see the runway photo below !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">VICTORIA SILVSTEDT</span></b>
Victoria doesn&#39;t look this covered up usually, so this is a nice change !! She is wearing one of Christophe Guillarm&eacute; latest collection and is actually looking rather good in it too !! A fabulous gold stripe dress featuring diagonal bands of tiny gold sequins make for a real sparkler of a gown for this event !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">DAY 7 : &#39;COMING HOME&#39;</span></b>
Chinese director Zhang Yimou tells the poignant story of Lu Yanshi and Feng Wanyu, who are a devoted couple forced to separate when Lu is arrested and sent to a labor camp as a political prisoner, just as his wife is injured in an accident.
Released during the last days of the Cultural Revolution, he finally returns home only to find that his beloved wife has amnesia and remembers little of her past. Unable to recognize Lu, she patiently waits for her husband&#39;s return. A stranger alone in the heart of his broken family, Lu Yanshi determines to resurrect their past together and reawaken his wife&#39;s memory. With the assistance of his daughter Dandan, Lu tries every way he can to make Feng recognize him. As both undergo their own rehabilitation, the couple&rsquo;s romantic history is partly resuscitated through souvenirs of the past <span class=""st"">&mdash;</span> an old photo, unsent letters, a piano tune Lu plays. Feng&rsquo;s fractured memory holds unimaginable pain, culminating in the disclosure of a terrible sacrifice she made in exchange for Lu&rsquo;s safety.

This was out of the competition and therefore wasn&#39;t a huge premi&egrave;re, but I&#39;ve included it because the two leading ladies both looked amazing !!.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">GONG LI</span></b>
This is the director&#39;s ex-wife, with whom he has collaborated in the past at least three times, with films being shown at Cannes - she was a bit of a muse for him at the time. In this film she plays the wife with no memory of her husband, and turns in a fantastic performance by all accounts !!
Here she is wearing a beautiful gown designed by Roberto Cavalli, and one which is fairly typical of his flirty style. It is all demure and virginal white round the front, and all kinds of lacings and whatnot up the back...

<img alt=""Gong Li 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/965025/965025_600.jpg"" title=""Gong Li 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Gong Li 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/965307/965307_600.jpg"" title=""Gong Li 02"" />

Just look at all the sexy accoutrements in the rear view - I love the gold chains in particular - very fine and catching the light beautifully. Large red rhinestones enhance the semi-circular motifs on each side, and gold beaded threads form a mesh across her entire back.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HUIWEN ZHANG</span></b>
This is Huiwen&#39;s first feature film apparently - she plays the part of Dan Dan, the teenage daughter who turns her father in to the authorities, and later, when he is released, helps him try to get his wife&#39;s memory back. She is very young, but still turned in a fabulous red carpet appearance in this amazing gown designed by Alber Elbaz for the Lanvin Resort 2014 Collection.

I liked the fullness of the tiered skirts and the sweet little bow round the back. I also liked her lovely little dangly earrings - a very youthful outfit for a very grown-up red carpet. Beautiful fine pleating part of the way down with the edges left plain on every tier makes this an unusual enough design to make it very memorable.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">DAY 8 : &#39;THE SEARCH&#39;</span></b>
The Second Chechen War. 1999. THE SEARCH recounts, on a human scale, a powerful story of conflict told through four lives that will be brought together by a shocking twist of fate.
After his parents are killed in their village, a small boy flees, joining the flood of refugees. He meets Carole, a European Union delegation head and little by little, with her help, he will return to life. At the same time, his elder sister Ra&iuml;ssa searches tirelessly for him amongst the civilian exodus.
Then there&#39;s 20-year-old Kolia... A recent Russian Army recruit, he will gradually be overwhelmed by the daily life of wartime.
Director Michel Hazanavicius talked about this story to the Press:-
&quot;I tried to make this a film about ordinary people exposed to war, whether they are soldiers or not. I didn&#39;t want the characters to be politically aware. Based on what I&#39;ve been able to read, the Russian Army was quite&nbsp; brutal, and often behaved violently. At the time it was being rebuilt and is therefore partly made up of mercenaries. I did a lot of research into this. I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ve betrayed the daily reality of the soldiers.&quot;

This was a pretty big premiere with lots of red carpet action - the film stars Berenice Bejo, the highly acclaimed French actress of course, and Annette Bening, who didn&#39;t appear tp make it to Cannes this year.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">AISHWARYA RAI</span></b>
Aishwarya turned heads in this beautiful white dress, her second designed by Roberto Cavalli and a real beauty too - covered in beading and festooned with fringing, the fishtail shape flatters without clinging, and without revealing too much either !! Ditching the bright red lipstick this time, she made an altogether more natural look with well-defined eyes and a natural lip gloss. I&#39;ve just noticed she has green eyes - amazing !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ARAYA HARGATE</span></b>
Araya is a model and actress, born to an English father and a Laotian mother, she was raised in Thailand, where she is a pretty well known face !! Here, she is not so well known, but with a bit of luck, Cannes could be a way for her to get her face better known over here. She chose this beautiful black sequinned dress designed by Kaufmann Franco - or rather I should say, Kaufmann Franco, more then likely, invited her to wear some of his stuff on the red carpet at Cannes - she probably wouldn&#39;t have gone otherwise, unless she is in a film being launched here. This is the name of the fashion game at events like Cannes - make no mistake - these actresses couldn&#39;t afford to buy these dresses, therefore they are paid to wear them...
Araya looked stunning in this though - I kind of like the veryu structured look of this dress - it&#39;s very stiff because of all the heavy sequin-work. I love her hair back like this and I also love the moulded black lacquer box-clutch she is carrying.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">BERENICE BEJO</span></b>
Here&#39;s Berenice, who might be able to afford her dress possibly, (but still probably didn&#39;t pay for it !!) This is by Alexis Mabille, one of my favourite Couture designers. Thick velvet with satin facings, this looks like a double-breasted smoking jacket with a strapless bodice. The wrap-over front gave way to the high winds of course, but she managed to keep her dignity intact !! Beautiful natural-looking make-up and hair, and a nice pair of diamond earrings.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CARA DELAVINGNE</span></b>
Our very own, and very popular Model of the Moment, Cara made an appearance on the red carpet in a a really great little mini-dress from Uncle Karl - this was from the Chanel Autumn 2013 Couture Collection, and in that show, it was shown on the runway heavily disguised under a thick tweed jacket, so you could very easily miss it , hence the possible reason why Cara is wearing it today. She is one of Karl Lagerfeld&#39;s favourite models, landing the job of being the face of Chanel&#39;s Resort 2013 Campaign last year. I liked this and the way she styled it with the definite exception of the bag, which jars a bit as being a bit too daytime for this dress.. Everything else is fabulous - I love th huge earrings, and I love the dark wine-red lipstick - it really suits her and is different to her usual look. The side-swept hair is great too !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CLOTILDE COUREAU</span></b>
Clotilde made an unexpectedly bold statement, teaming this Pre-fall 2014 Valentino dress with a huge gold and peachy enamel pendent - this looked a tad oversizeed at first, but now I like it - it&#39;s a big and bold piece which lifts the plain gold colour of the dress. It&#39;s an interesting look and one which caught my attention !!

<span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><b>LARA STONE</b></span>
Lara went all out for attention with this amazing, and almost neon pink column dress designed for her by Francisco Costa for the Calvin Klein Collection. I liked this because it was an extremely bold statement colour on the red carpet - it clashes and jumps against the red !!&nbsp; Sensibly, she didn&#39;t wear any heavy jewels - just a narrow diamond bracelet and a tiny pair of earrings - and let the dress do all the talking !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ROSIE HUNTINGDON-WHITELY</span></b>
Rosie looked sensational in this beautiful grey-green gown from the Gucci Premi&egrave;re collection, which is making real headway these days. This label only started a few years ago - I remember talking about its launch at Cannes, in here at the time !! She looks beautiful in this with a pair of lovely diamond earrings and notmuch else - no bag, and no other jewels at all, just herself, which is often much the best way !!

<b><span style=""font-size: 1.8em;""><span style=""color:#305685;"">DAYS 5-6 : 3 PREMI&Egrave;RES</span></span></b>
Days 5-6 involved three quite big screenings in terms of red carpet activity, over in the South of France last week - so here are my choices for those three films:-

<lj-cut>
<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">DAY 5 : &quot;THE HOMESMAN&quot;</span></b>

In &quot;The Homesman&quot;, his fifth feature film, Tommy Lee Jones&nbsp; sets out in a covered wagon with Hilary Swank across the plains, heading for Iowa. The film is inspired by the novel of the same name by Glendon Swarthout.
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mary Bee Cuddy, a strong, independent pioneer, is driving a covered wagon with an unusual cargo, three women who have gone mad, mistreated under harsh living conditions. As for George Brigg, he is on the verge of losing his life. With a noose around his neck, on a donkey ready to let him dangle in mid-air, he sees Cuddy&#39;s wagon appear before him and asks:<em> &quot;Are you an angel?&quot;</em>
These two strong characters that destiny has placed on the same path learn to get along together to reach their destination. Cuddy is played by Hilary Swank, who learned to ride in 19th-century style, and Tommy Lee Jones plays Brigg, a completely unscrupulous vagabond.</p><em>The Homesman</em>, a highly instructive film on US&nbsp;history according to Luc Besson :
<em>&quot;This film portrays a vision of the United States which is little known in Europe. It&#39;s a very exotic vision for us . We didn&#39;t know that times were as hard as this. We all know about the American dream but it&#39;s good to know what went on before the dream.&quot;</em>

This was a popular film on&nbsp; the Cannes red carpet, with all four main characters making an appearance. Lovely dresses abound...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">FREIDA PINTO</span></b>
Freida Pinto went off to Uncle Oscar for her red carpet Cannes d&eacute;but this year, with this amazing ball gown in red, with gold embroidery all down the edges of the wrap-fronted skirt. With gold court shoes, gold cuff and a nice line of pearl earring studs edging her earlobe, she looked lovely !! This was from the Oscar de la Renta Autumn 2014 Collection.

Her hair tied back in a very sleek ponytail, and with defined but subtle make-up, she looked the epitome of a Hollywood star.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HILARY SWANK</span></b>
Hilary is one of the main stars in this film, and made sure everyone noticed her on the red carpet with this beautiful white one-shouldered Atelier Versace dress, which flattered her figure with all the wrappings across the middle, and the pretty draped panel at the back - a nice feature, I thought !!

I loved her hair over one shoulder - all the better to show off the huge blue statement earrings by Chopard. Except for the creasing across her hips, this would have been a great contender for the Best Dress of the Day - so instead she gets one of my Gold Stars !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SONAM KAPOOR</span></b>
Sonam is the face of L&#39;Oreal India,and it&#39;s in this capacity that she appears at Cannes this year - therefore be prepared to see quite a bit of her over the next few posts !! Here, she is wearing the most marvellous black ball-gown designed by Elie Saab for his Spring 2014 Couture Collection. Luckily, this is one that I picked out when I went off to see the photos from the show, so I get a big Zebra Star for my efforts !! She gets a big Gold Star for looking amazing in it...

Well-defined make-up with smoky eyes and bright red lipstick stopped her from being overwhelmed by this huge dress - I love the slash neckline for her - it&#39;s very elegant, and the massive skirts emphasize her tiny waist. All the beading is a very typical Elie Saab touch, and lends a bit of sparkle !! Below is the runway photo and as you can see, it was just as big on the runway as it is on the red carpet !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SUKI WATERHOUSE</span></b>
Suki chose this strapless two-tiered dress in lilac silk, also from Christian Dior, which looked lovely on the red carpet. She styled it with the amazing peacock feather earrings from Chopard. I would have liked a bit of a better hairdo for this dress and earrings combo, seeing as they are both so individual and expensive, but hey-ho - &#39;tis a good red carpet ensemble anyway !! From the back, her hair looks lovely...I suspect the wind was doing a fair bit of damage.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">VANESSA HESSLER</span></b>
Vanessa wore a beautiful slinky little number embellished with diagonal lines of sequins, and a fly-away panel over one shoulder - this was designed by French designer Christophe Guillarm&eacute;, who regularly show-cases his work on this red carpet - it&#39;s usually worn by the likes of Phoebe Price or Victoria Silvstedt, so actress/model Vanessa is a much classier act altogether !! She looks amazing in this beautiful design, so Bravo Christophe - she gets a Gold Star for looking a million dollars...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">DAY 6 : &quot;MAPS TO THE STARS&quot;</span></b>
David Cronenberg directed this movie about Hollywood and how it operates - the story involves Benjie, 13 years old and already a star; his father, Sanford Weiss, a successful author and coach to celebrities, and his client, the beautiful Havana Segrand, whom he helps to find fulfilment both as a woman and as an actress; Agatha, Havana&#39;s assistant, and the seductive limousine driver, Jerome Fontana, who also aspires to fame.<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To direct the original screenplay by Bruce Wagner, a Hollywood family drama that teeters between satire and realism, Cronenberg set up his cameras on American soil for the first time. There he filmed a strange, psychotic, Lynchean ballet, characters with psyches that are fractured by an overweening ambition to achieve fame. The result is a Gothic tale that verges on tragicomedy, haunted by the ghosts of the past and where instinctive urges are let loose and there is the smell of blood. Hollywood becomes a character in its own right, with tentacles that entrap the people who live in its grasp. Beyond the set of the City of Angels, David Cronenberg delivers ten years worth of his reflection on the quest for fame.

Sounds like a fascinating film and probably is if it&#39;s a typical Cronenberg movie...

Six really great dresses on this red carpet :-</p><b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">BEATRICE ROSEN</span></b>
Beatrice chose a pale lemon design by Vionnet which caught my eye because of the unusual extra panel front and back which makes it look like two dresses in one - perhaps you can remove the whole centre piece and have a Grecian-style dress with just two shoulder-straps if you so desire !!

The high wind at Cannes this year has been a bit of a challenge for everyone on the red carpets, but it&#39;s been interesting to see who found it a bit more than they could cope with, others who found it highly amusing, and then those who sailed though completely unsullied, seemingly without a hair out of place !! Beatrice was one of the second group judging by the last photo here - much the best way really...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CARLY STEEL</span></b>
Carly is a TV personality, TV actress and film actress too - and she holds a first class degree in law from Durham University to boot - so no airhead then !! She works mainly on American telly and is best known to viewers over there, even though she was born in Scotland. She is a regular at the Cannes Film Festival in her capacity as a TV Presenter for ABC and she has covered this festival for Yahoo! Movies too.
This was her second appearance on the red carpet, and she chose this beautiful pale grey beaded dress, embellished with sequins and whispy chiffony bits, giving it a feathery appearance.
A silver clutch and grey pearly knot earrings completed her look.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">GABRIELLA WRIGHT</span></b>
Actress Gabriella Wright chose a wonderful rich cobalt-blue dress with a beaded neckline and full long sleeves for this event - and what a lovely choice !! It&#39;s unusual to see full length sleeves on the red carpet, as most dresses are strapless or with just straps and bare shoulders - I like the rich blue colour and the blue, turquoise and silver diamant&eacute; embroidery too. Worthy of a Gold Star I think...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JULIANNE MOORE</span></b>
Julianne Moore stars in this movie as the troubled star Havana Segrand, who seeks help from the main character Sanford Weiss, the coach to the stars. She looked much better on this red carpet than she did a few days ago - (see my Worst Dressed post later this week) - having chosen this white feathery ultra-sheer dress from Chanel&#39;s Spring 2014 Couture Collection. Sadly, this wasn&#39;t one of my choices when I looked at this collection, but there you go !!

I loved her auburn hair up like this - it gives her an air of elegance, which I find lacking in a lot of stars these days - gosh, hark at me - I sound like I&#39;m about 50 - oh wait....

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SARAH GADON</span></b>
Sarah was also one of the stars in this film, playing the role of Clarice Taggart - she chose a beautiful couture gown from Giorgio Armani, from his Armani Priv&eacute; Spring 2014 Collection. I thought this was one that I picked out but it&#39;s not the same -&nbsp; a similar one without all the Indian fan-shaped motifs which I loved. This one is a plainer version with an overlay of lace, which you can see coming over the edge of the strapless bodice.
She looked great in this with her hair up and shiny red lipstick !! Nice diamond earrings too...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">DAY 6 : &quot;THE FOXCATCHER&quot;</span></b>
Bennett Miller directs this film which tells the story of the tragic links that brought together John E. du Pont, a paranoid multimillionaire found guilty of murder, and two champion wrestlers. He also confirms his penchant for real-life dramas and characters in the sporting world who diverge from conventional patterns of behaviour. The film tells of an incident that took place in 1996: the murder of one of the two brothers, Olympic champion Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo) by the cyclothymic billionaire, played on screen by Steve Carell. The film&rsquo;s screenplay is based on the autobiography of Mark Schultz (played by Channing Tatum), the dead champion&rsquo;s brother, an Olympic champion in the same discipline in 1984, and who was visited by Bennett Miller..

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CHERYL COLE</span></b>
Cheryl Cole looked lovely in this Monique L&#39;Huillier dress from her Autumn 2014 Collection. I was impressed by her cool in the face of high wind, whilst wearing a dress that had a tendency to fly up in her face !! She kept calm and dignified, and walked the red carpet looking lovely, with her hair in a truly beautiful chignon style, and the biggest boldest earrings I&#39;ve seen in a while !!

Fighting with the high wind in a rise and fall gown is no mean feat, so I felt she really earned her big Gold Star at this event...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JESS WEIXLER</span></b>
Jess Weixler looked absolutely lovely in this beautiful black dress designed by Armani Priv&eacute;, from the Autumn 2013 Couture Collection - I liked this enormously, for all the intricate beading all over the bodice and skirt, and the tiny knots up the shoulder straps. Her hair looks a tad severe, and may I venture to suggest it looked like it was a bit damp, and at the back, her bun was a bit of a mystery...was it a fishtail plait coiled round and round ? Maybe...

Nice earrings though and good make-up, more then made up for the dodgy hair !! Cost her a Gold Star though...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KRISTINA BAZAN</span></b>
Kristina Bazan wore a Christian Dior dress, which you might all recognise as being from the Dior Spring 2014 RTW Collection, a photo of which I have below, from the runway. This is an unusual choice, but a good one - I liked these brocade dresses when they came out on the Dior runway and I like them now !! This one features flashes of burnt orange which goes with the black and silver of the rest of the dress beautifully. Again, her hair is very severe, and like Jess above, it would benefit from softening down a bit - mind you, it does give you a good view of her earrings and necklace, which is a good thing, in my view !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SARAH MARSHALL</span></b>
Sarah wore a very interesting black lace mini-dress with a sheer over-skirt attached from the front, and flying back in the ever-present high wind !! She looked great in this I thought, especially as she is a bit older - it&#39;s nice to see someone with the confidence to wear such a racy design and look great in it. Lovely hair and great shoes too.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SONAM KAPOOR</span></b>
Sonam ditched the Western ball-gown style for this event and went, instead, for her native Indian sari-style, designed by Anamika Khanna. I remember she wore something like this last year and looked fabulous in it, and so she does here too. This is a really great take on the sari, updated for a modern audience with a gold sequinned top and sheer fabric wrapped round and round. Incidentally, her own mother Sunita created the spectacular gold and pearl necklace to go with it - fabulous stuff !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">BEST DRESS OF THE DAY !!</span></b>
My newest innovation for events like Cannes is my &#39;Best Dress of the Day&#39; Award, which will be awarded for the one star who really looks the business.There will be potential for one every day, but not necessarily an award given out - all depends on the general calibre - so no pressure than !! Furthermore, as I&#39;m not necessarily awarding my Gold Crown every day, it&#39;s definitely an honour to get one !!
So, without further ado, I give you - my Best Dress of the Day from &#39;The Foxcatcher &#39; premi&egrave;re, Jessica Chastain...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">JESSICA CHASTAIN</span></b>
Jessica really blew me away with this gorgeous dress from Lebanese designer Elie Saab - from his Spring 2014 Couture Collection this lovely lilac chiffon number wafted round the red carpet beautifully, and even when the wind picked up, it still managed to look absolutely <i>stunning !! </i>I am also delighted to say that it&#39;s one that I chose when I looked at this collection at the time - hurrah !!

Again, like Blake in my previous post, she really epitomised red carpet Hollywood style so well at this event. Jessica is one of my favourite stars for red carpet dressing, as she really seems to know the kind of thing she is comfortable in, and what suits her figure <i>and</i> the best colours for that glorious red hair !! As a result, she always looks comfortable, relaxed and confident - and you can&#39;t say fairer than that. She gets my coveted Crown for the Best Dress of the Day for this post.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><span style=""color: rgb(212, 21, 142);"">DAYS 2-3 : 4 PREMI&Egrave;RES</span></span></b>

Here we are then with the next four premi&egrave;res shown at Cannes over the last ten days - lots of stars and of course, lots of great dresses...
<lj-cut>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">DAY 2 : &#39;MR TURNER&#39;</span></b>
First premi&egrave;re of the day was &#39;Mr Turner&#39; - Mike Leigh&#39;s promising biopic of Romantic painter J M W Turner, starring Timothy Spall in the lead role. A pretty good red carpet turn-out for this film, which is Mike Leigh&#39;s fifth showing at Cannes. Here are the best dresses from that premi&egrave;re:-

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">AISSA MAIGA</span></b>
<span>Senegalese-born French actress, A&iuml;ssa Ma&iuml;ga</span>, showed up in this beautiful criss-cross-strapped white gown with invert-pleated skirt to flatter her curves. This was gorgeous actually, and even though I can&#39;t find out who designed this, I consider it one of the best on show for this date !!

<img alt=""Aissa Maiga 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/925149/925149_600.jpg"" title=""Aissa Maiga 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Aissa Maiga 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/925349/925349_600.jpg"" title=""Aissa Maiga 02"" />

I also loved her corn-row mini-dreads which is an unusual and interesting take on the updo for the red carpet. Silvery tassel earrings complete her look nicely, and just take a look at her little butterfly ring !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">BLAKE LIVELY</span></b>
It would be no exaggeration to admit that Blake has really been impressing me at this year&#39;s festival - she has consistently worn great choices all week - this was the first dress she chose - a gorgeous white pearly sequinned little number from the Chanel Spring 2014 Couture Collection, which I picked out at the time, as it happens !!

<img alt=""Blake Lively 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/926036/926036_600.jpg"" title=""Blake Lively 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Blake Lively 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/926710/926710_600.jpg"" title=""Blake Lively 02"" />

Free-flowing hair keeps it casual which is perfectly in tune with the Chanel couture style these days - just look at what the model&#39;s wearing on her feet in the runway photo, and you&#39;ll see what I mean - thank goodness Blake didn&#39;t follow suit...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CATE BLANCHETT</span></b>
Cate made an appearance at this event and really lived up to her amazing red carpet reputation in this grey lacy Valentino design from their Pre-Fall 2014 Collection. The feathery collar and shoulder details really stand-out, but in a very subtle way. She looked beautiful in this with her hair up and her usual flawlessly natural, but well-defined make-up. I loved her drop earrings too,

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">INES DE LA FRESSANGE</span></b>
French model and actress, Ines de la Fressange made an entrance onto the red carpet in this beautiful white high-necked dress, which managed to be slinky and elegant at the same time - no mean feat !! She wore a really impressive pair of diamond earrings, and carried a bright turquoise wrap for when it got colder later in the evening. Her silver rectangular clutch reflected the red of the carpet, so it looks a bit red at first glance, in this photo, but it is actually silver !!

<img alt=""Ines de la Fressange 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/928571/928571_600.jpg"" title=""Ines de la Fressange 01"" /> &nbsp; <img alt=""Ines de la Fressange 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/930855/930855_600.jpg"" title=""Ines de la Fressange 02"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ZOE SALDANA</span></b>
Zoe looked smashing at the premi&egrave;re too - she went with a gorgeous bias-cut, velvet devor&eacute; column dress with a matching scarf. This was designed by Jason Wu, from his Autumn 2014 Collection, and very beautiful it was too !! The dress looks black with dark green velvet flowers in the first two photos, but the darkest teal blue on blue-black in the third, so I&#39;m not&nbsp; very clear on the actual exact colour of this, but it&#39;s beautiful all the same !!

<img alt=""Zoe Saldana 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/930083/930083_600.jpg"" title=""Zoe Saldana 01"" /> &nbsp; <img alt=""Zoe Saldana 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/930406/930406_600.jpg"" title=""Zoe Saldana 02"" />

I liked her hair up in a low chignon, and the huge vintagey 1980s-style earrings she chose, and I also liked her matching dark metallic-green nails !!

<img alt=""Zoe Saldana 03"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/930788/930788_600.jpg"" title=""Zoe Saldana 03"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">&#39;TIMBUKTU&#39;</span></b>
Also, on the same evening, the film &#39;Timbuktu&#39; showed its premi&egrave;re screening, but didn&#39;t have such a big audience, of course. I did pick out one dress that really stood out though !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SONIA ROLLANDE</span></b>
Sonia Rollande looked amazing in this Zuhair Murad creation from his Autumn 2014 Collection, worn with diamond jewellery - an impressive three-piece set of a pair of drop earrings and a pretty bracelet and ring to match, and a really short cropped haircut.

<img alt=""Sonia Rolland 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/931790/931790_600.jpg"" title=""Sonia Rolland 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Sonia Rolland 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/932014/932014_600.jpg"" title=""Sonia Rolland 02"" />

Nice back button detail on this design !!

<span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><b>DAY 3 : &#39;HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2&#39;</b></span>
This animated trilogy screened its second instalment at the Cannes Festival this year, and had Cate Blanchett and America Ferrera amongst the voice-cast. A popular film this, with lots of lovely dresses on show...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">AMERICA FERRERA</span></b>
Here&#39;s America in her gorgeous dress of many frothy layers, designed by Georges Hobeika, from his Autumn 2014 Collection. Unfortunately, she had to suffer the indignity of some twattish prankster who decided to dive underneath her skirts from the back, whilst they were all posing in a line-up for the world&#39;s press !! She recovered remarkably quickly however, after the security guards escorted him away. Poor America, but look on the bright side - it&#39;s all good publicity - she got her face in more press photos as a result, which can&#39;t be a bad thing !!

<img alt=""America Ferrera 01jpg"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/932427/932427_600.jpg"" title=""America Ferrera 01jpg"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""America Ferrera 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/932723/932723_600.jpg"" title=""America Ferrera 02"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CARLY STEEL</span></b>
Carly showed up on the red carpet in a very complex dress adorned with piping-cord in cream and gold - a bit complicated for me, but she looked great anyway. Gorgeous make-up and hair and a beautiful pair of ball-tassel earrings.

<img alt=""Carly Steel 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/933552/933552_600.jpg"" title=""Carly Steel 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Carly Steel 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/933727/933727_600.jpg"" title=""Carly Steel 02"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CLOTILDE COUREAU</span></b>
Clotilde wore a beautiful black floral-printed gown designed by Elie Saab, from his Autumn 2014 Collection. Worn with a fabulous 80s-style chain necklace with blue stones, she looked a million dollars. I loved her little wiggly bun round the back and the kohl-rimmed eyes combined with pretty natural make-up everywhere else !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ELENA LENINA</span></b>
Here she is - the current fashion clown of the week - she has made it into my Worst-Dressed list a couple of times this week of course - (that post will be coming at the end) - but on the 16th of May, her crazy hairdo apart, her outfit was absolutely gorgeous !! I loved this nude lacy dress with its beautiful cascade of waterfall ruffles all down the front and back, and the train - and the fact that it didn&#39;t show any cleavage at all - that isn&#39;t quite Elena&#39;s style, although it could easily have been !!
The crimped swathes of hair embellishing her own high bun is just too fantastic to contemplate...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">EMILIA SCHULE</span></b>
Emilia restored a little sanity to the red carpet with this beautiful purple dress, black clutch and belt combination. This was just a marvellous shade for her, but if it was in a less brilliant colour, perhaps it wouldn&#39;t have made this list - the colour here is everything. Also, her hair and make-up are pretty much perfect !!

<img alt=""Emilia Schule 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/936263/936263_600.jpg"" title=""Emilia Schule 01"" /> &nbsp; <img alt=""Emilia Schule 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/936657/936657_600.jpg"" title=""Emilia Schule 02"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HOFIT GOLAN</span></b>
Israeli journalist and socialite Hofit Golan looked amazing in this beautiful black lace dress, giving the illusion of a very low <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute; </i>- what looks like a rather plunging neckline is actually up around her throat, and it&#39;s the black lace that plunges down to her navel. Marchesa are very good at this kind of thing, but It&#39;s not one of theirs. Oh no - this is by Lebanese designer Nicolas Jebran - a new name to watch out for...

<img alt=""Hofit Golan 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/937649/937649_600.jpg"" title=""Hofit Golan 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Hofit Golan 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/937859/937859_600.jpg"" title=""Hofit Golan 02"" />

Swarovski clutch, red lipstick and matching nails, and gold drop earrings make for a dramatic red carpet look !! I love her hair too...

<img alt=""Hofit Golan 03"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/938194/938194_600.jpg"" title=""Hofit Golan 03"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">INES DE LA FRESSANGE</span></b>
Here&#39;s Ines again, on the next evening, looking dramatic in a bright red one shouldered Grecian-style gown with silver strappy sandals - totally flat for a change, and a silver and black clutch. Like Hofit, she went for the bright red lipstick and matching nails - always a good bet !!

<img alt=""Ines de la Fressange 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/938356/938356_600.jpg"" title=""Ines de la Fressange 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Ines de la Fressange 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/938511/938511_600.jpg"" title=""Ines de la Fressange 02"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">NAOMI WATTS</span></b>
Oh, I <i>loved</i> this amazing gown - Naomi Watts looked simply stunning in this blue-grey chiffon-draped gown designed by those girls over at Marchesa especially for her !! She looked a gazillion dollars in this, especially with the addition of that <i>fabulous</i> Bulgari snake coiled round her neck...

<img alt=""Naomi Watts 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/939049/939049_600.jpg"" title=""Naomi Watts 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Naomi Watts 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/939492/939492_600.jpg"" title=""Naomi Watts 02"" />

Interesting side-swept hairdo keeps the back of her neck clear to show the necklace off nicely, and an equally interesting back to the dress makes for my Best Dress of the Day - perhaps...
The only thing I would question is the shininess of her face - no powder available ? Therefore, she gets my Silver runner-up prize for second-best Dress of the Day !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">&#39;CAPTIVES&#39;</span></b>
Also showing on the 16th was the premi&egrave;re of &#39;Captives&#39;, directed by Canadian director Atom Egoyan, about the breakdown of relations between the relatives of a kidnapped young girl. Not a big red carpet premi&egrave;re but there were three notable gowns:-

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">NATACHA REGNIER</span></b>
Natacha chose a very 1980s style gown with a richly embroidered strapless bodice, featuring roses in two shades of sea-green on black, with a plain back skirt. A beautiful dress for sure, but one which I would have put my hair up with, if I had hair the length of Natcha&#39;s - it always looks so much more <i>dressy</i>, I always think.

<img alt=""Natacha Regnier 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/941059/941059_600.jpg"" title=""Natacha Regnier 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Natacha Regnier 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/941447/941447_600.jpg"" title=""Natacha Regnier 02"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ROSARIO DAWSON</span></b>
Rosario looked lovely in this black and white floral print, designed by Dolce &amp; Gabbana. A lovely dress and one which suits Rosario well. Her hair and earrings fascinate me though - both are short on one side and long on the other - how novel !! The long drop-earrings, incidentally, are the same ones that Sonia Rollande wore to the &#39;Timbuktu&#39; premi&egrave;re further up this post !!

As is the way with these things, I have saved the best till last:-

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">BLAKE LIVELY</span></b>
Blake simply swept everyone else away with this amazing black and white gown from Gucci Premi&egrave;re - this is the second candidate for my Best Dress of the Day - this dress is so utterly perfectly fitted, it makes Blake look like Marilyn Monroe !! Fabulous stuff...

<img alt=""Blake Lively 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/940174/940174_600.jpg"" title=""Blake Lively 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Blake Lively 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/940385/940385_600.jpg"" title=""Blake Lively 02"" />

Just take a look at the back view too - this<i> surely</i> is what red carpet dressing is all about - no&nbsp; ?!! It&#39;s interesting, unusual, and elegant, and makes her look like a goddess - you can&#39;t ask much more from your red carpet gown, can you ?...
I loved her hair in its side-swept chignon and the diamonds are of course <i>fabulous</i> !! From Lorraine Schwarz, they weigh around 180 Carats I believe...
All in all, Blake wins my Gold Crown for the Best Dress of the Day for the 16th May, and pips Naomi Watts to the post, because she looks great all round.

<span style=""color:#e6a709;""><b><span style=""font-size: 1.8em;"">TOP TWENTY BEST DRESSED STARS !!</span></b></span>
During this busy fashion week, what with the goings on at Cannes, our own Chelsea Flower Show getting under way, and the Billboard Music Awards taking place over the pond, we had our own little red carpet event here in London - so I have decided to cover that instead of the BMIs, as they are on my own turf, so to speak !!

<lj-cut>

Quite a few lovely dresses on show here, and a couple of more unusual outfits that got my attention too...and a whole lot that looked OK, but didn&#39;t quite make the cut !! This event was sponsored by House of Fraser, as well as Arqiva, amongst others - therefore, it didn&#39;t come as much of a surprise to hear that they offered free evening wear to the stars on the red carpet guest-list, so a lot of these outfits come courtesy of them. Kudos to them for the idea of getting themselves tons of free publicity, but I only found out on one website, so perhaps that backfired slightly !! Or perhaps websites like mine will spread the word independently, and the magic will work that way...all the same, for us mere mortals, the great news is that if you like any of these outfits, most of them are readily available to buy for a relatively small outlay, compared to most designer dresses.
Anyway, here are my own personal Top 20 Best Dressed ladies...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">AMBER LE BON</span></b>
Amber chose this beautiful intricately beaded dress designed by Adriana Papell for &pound;290, and also a silver box-clutch from the &#39;Untold&#39; brand for &pound;80 - not bad at all for such a big red carpet event !! She looks great in it too, with her hair waved and swept over one shoulder, and make-up nice and natural:-

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ELIZABETH McGOVERN</span></b>

Downton Abbey star Elizabeth McGovern looked lovekly in this white ensemble with white beading and sequins down the front - I liked the square shoulder-line combined with the deep V at the front - very flattering and very smart for a slightly less posh red carpet event like this !!&nbsp; Not entirely convinced about the rather unflattering haircut, but the rest was lovely...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">EMILY ATACK</span></b>
Emily also looked fab on the red carpet in a trouser and jacket combo from Mary Portas at House of Fraser - the jacket was &pound;99, the trousers &pound;69 and her little clutch was from the Biba brand for &pound;59. I really liked this actually, even though it wasn&#39;t a conventional dress, it still looked very smart and was a little bit unusual with the waistcoat-style front of the jacket. Beautiful make-up for an evening do, with very well-defined eyes and a soft red lipstick.
I have to say though, she could have done with a better hairstyle really - it&#39;s all a bit untidy - I would have liked a bit of an updo with this I think, as it would have made the whole look more sophisticated...

I did really like her tassel necklace too - it&#39;s unusual, modern but a bit exotic at the same time !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">GEORGIE THOMPSON</span></b>
Georgie chose this beautiful whiote dress with sheer stripes going over the shoulders and looked fab in it. I loved this as it&#39;s unusual and eye-catching - and plain white in a sea of black dresses !! Hair up, black clutch and well defined eyes combined with natural make-up gives her a very polished red carpet look !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">GIZZIE ERSKINE</span></b>
Oh my - Gizzie looks simply <i>fabulous</i> in&nbsp; vintage 1960s glittery tweed outfit designed by Carven, from William Vintage - I guessed at Chanel at first, as it has that unmistakable Karl Lagerfeld look - fitted, stand-away roll collar, fly-away sheer cape, bias-cut fabric embellished with black sequins to look like a tweed check- how very Chanel !!

<img alt=""Gizzi Erskine 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/912430/912430_600.jpg"" title=""Gizzi Erskine 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Gizzi Erskine 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/912793/912793_600.jpg"" title=""Gizzi Erskine 02"" />

She had her hair done up in a very 60s style, and eye make-up to match - a brilliant take on the whole 1960s vintage look !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HELENA BONHAM-CARTER</span></b>
Helena did something similar, but with her, it was a Vivienne Westwood strapless dress, worn with huge 1960s rhinestone-studded sunglasses, pearl jewellery and pale pink lipstick - how very Elizabeth Taylor !! She, of course was up for a BAFTA for her portrayal of La Taylor in the TV drama &#39;<i>Burton and Taylor</i>, for which both she and her co-star, Dominic West were nominated.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JANE DANSON</span></b>
Jane looked lovely in this beautiful blue dress, embellished with diamant&eacute; detailing - I loved this as its an unusual design but could feasibly suit anyone. The criss-cross bodice combined with a high Empire-line is quite a flattering style, especially if you&#39;re small-busted - it gives you a bit of a shape boost !!
A well-cut but casual hairstyle looks lovely and natural make-up keeps it all simple.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JODIE WHITTAKER</span></b>
Jodie didn&#39;t get her elegant black frock from the House of Fraser - she went off to Swedish designer Britta Kjerkegaard, and her shop The Couture Gallery in Old Compton St. and selected her dress from the racks there - it&#39;s the kind of shop where you have to make an appointment to see the collection - daunting, much ? If you&#39;ve been invited to the BAFTAs though, and you like the label, then why not !!
Sadly there weren&#39;t many photos for this event, so we can&#39;t see the back view, which I would love to see - I want to know what happens to that neckline at the back !!
This is simple, elegant and unusual, as well as being flattering - it ticks all the red carpet boxes in my book !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JULIE WALTERS</span></b>
Julie was up for a special award - she was being awarded the BAFTA Fellowship which is an honour indeed !! She looked great in this kaftan-style dress with diamant&eacute; detail - glamorous but a bit edgy, which is perfect for Julie !! I liked her choice of silver clutch, shoes and drop earrings too - they went well with her spIky haircut.

<img alt=""Julie Walters 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/915213/915213_600.jpg"" title=""Julie Walters 01"" />  &nbsp; <img alt=""Julie Walters 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/915512/915512_600.jpg"" title=""Julie Walters 02"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KATE GARROWAY &amp; SUSANNA REID</span></b>
I put these two together because they chose the same dress from the House of Fraser collection, which is of course the main danger of wearing department store designs !! They both went for the Clara design by Biba, but luckily in different colours - Kate went for the champagne and Susanna went for the Fuchsia. This dress costs &pound;289, but clearly carries the risk of someone showing up in it at the same venue !! They both looked good in it, but Susanna has the edge as the neckline on hers is considerably lower - a much more flattering position for a draped cowl-neckline like this...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KERRIE HAYES</span></b>
Kerrie went for a gorgeous strapless beaded gown embellished with appliqu&eacute; flowers scattered all down the bodice and skirt. She wore her hair up which is always a good option with a strapless dress, especially if you are wearing a bit of a statement necklace too, like this one !! Her whole look ois one of the best of the evening, I reckon - what d&#39;you think ?

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LAURA WHITMORE</span></b>
Laura went for effortless white chic in this elgant column dress with its halter-neckline - immensely flattering for someone of Laura&#39;s height and build, but maybe not for anyone shorter or not so slim !! I liked this a lot, especially wqith her hair waved over one shoulder and red lipstick to give her a bit of colour.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MAXINE PEAKE</span></b>
Maxine is well kinown from &#39;<i>Dinnerladies</i>&#39; of course, but is now forging ahead with an impressive CV of drama roles - this time she was nominated for Best TV Actress for her role in &#39;<i>The Village&#39;</i>, but lost out to Olivia Coleman. She looked lovely in this coppery-gold dress with lacy detailing which complemented her red hair colour beautifully. I liked this because of the colour and the immensely flattering portrait neckline...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MILLIIE MACKINTOSH</span></b>
Millie is best known for her modelling and the fact that has just married Professor Green, of course !! She chose a fabulous white column gown embellished with gold squares all down the front and back, designed by Julien Macdonald, who knows a thing or two about sexy on the red carpet !! She looked amazing in it, and managed not to bare anything really, despite all that openwork down each side !! Burgundy lipstick gave her some colour, while her hgair up in a long ponytail looked sleek and well-groomed. Good clutch too...

<img alt=""Millie Mackintosh 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/918048/918048_600.jpg"" title=""Millie Mackintosh 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Millie Mackintosh 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/918319/918319_600.jpg"" title=""Millie Mackintosh 02"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">NAOMI CAMPBELL</span></b>
Naomi went with a designer dress rather than&nbsp; House of Fraser freebie - this revealing gown was designed by Roberto Cavalli, and as usual, she looked a million dollars in it !! Very revealing, but happily, she didn&#39;t look at all tarty, because she&#39;s well - Naomi !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">OLIVIA COLEMAN</span></b>
Olivia Coleman looked lovely in this bright green gown, worn with super high shoes, which she ditched later on in the evening, and some very pretty jewellery - I loved bher bracelet and earrings !!
The only aspect of this which i didn&#39;t like was her rather ageing hairstyle - I don&#39;t know what she did to herhair, but this slicked back style doesn&#39;t flatter her face really - make-up&#39;s good though, especially the zingy red lipstick.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">OONA CHAPLIN</span></b>
Oona Chaplin wore an amazing bright print dress which not everyone liked - the Daily Mail put it in their Worst Dressed list, but what do they know ?!! I loved this for it energy and bright colours - in a sea of black dresses this really stood out !! She carried her big yellow fan, which she had out in Cannes last week too - however, in the hot sun, it&#39;s a good accessory to have on you !

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ROCHELLE HUMES</span></b>
<span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">Rochelle looked amazing in this black and white gown, which ahd a slight look of Giorgio Armani about it with its strapless square stand-away neckiine - very unusual and very elegant !! It looks a tad tight across the hips giving those creases but that could also come from sitting down in the back of a cab, so I&#39;m not actually that bothered about that realy. I liked her unusual earrings too... </span>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SOPHIE ELLIS-BEXTOR</span></b>
Sophie wins my award for being the best Dressed at this event - I loved this gorgeous beaded black dress with its sheer bodice embellished with sparkly crystal and jet beads. This could easily be from the runway of Elie Saab or quite a few other big name designersa I can think of - however, this is from House of Fraser and costs &pound;370 from the Dynasty label !! Jusat goes to prove that a chain department store dress like this can look just as good on a red carpet as any couture designer in my book !! It&#39;s all about choosing something that suits your body-shape and wearing a flattering bra, etc, etc...and paying attention to hair, make-up and accessories is just as important as anything else.

<img alt=""Sophie Ellis-Bexter 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/922430/922430_600.jpg"" title=""Sophie Ellis-Bexter 02"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Sophie Ellis-Bextor 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/922785/922785_600.jpg"" title=""Sophie Ellis-Bextor 01"" />

That&#39;s it for the BAFTA TV Awards 2014 - and I hope this proves that department store dresses can look just as good as designer any day - it&#39;s all down to choosing wisely and well !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><span style=""color: rgb(212, 21, 142);"">OPENING CEREMONY &amp; &#39;GRACE OF MONACO&#39; PREMI&Egrave;RE</span></span></b>

Well, the annual red carpet fest that is Cannes Film Festival 2014 opened on Wednesday with a huge opening ceremony and a packed red carpet as usual - all and sundry were there and resplendent in their red carpet finery...
<lj-cut>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">DAY 1 - &#39;GRACE OF MONACO&#39;</span></b>
The festival opened with the premi&egrave;re screening of a film that has its fair share of controversy - &#39;<i>Grace of Monaco</i>&#39; is being almost universally panned for its wooden acting, bad screenplay and cavalier treatment of the facts !! Directed by Olivier Dahan, and starring Nicole Kidman as Grace Kelly and Tim Roth as Prince Rainier of Monaco, who swept the Hollywood star off her feet back in 1956, and made her a princess - the film concentrates on the year 1962, which was a year of fraught choices for them both.
The premi&egrave;re screening was positively crowded with big stars who were all in Cannes for the festival, and who managed to jet in early enough to attend the opening ceremony. Here are the Best Dressed of Wednesday evening:-

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">BLAKE LIVELY</span></b>
Blake looked absolutely stunning in this beautiful burgundy gown designed by Gucci Premi&egrave;re - she has been the official face of &#39;<i>Gucci Premi&egrave;re</i>&#39; the fragrance since 2012, so it&#39;s kind of inevitable that she will be wearing their evening-wear designs during Cannes this year. This dress is gorgeous though, with its unusual pleated front panel halter-neck design.

<img alt=""Blake Lively 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/899033/899033_600.jpg"" title=""Blake Lively 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Blake Lively 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/899099/899099_600.jpg"" title=""Blake Lively 02"" />

Her hair looks great, up in a messy plait, and drop-dead gorgeous gold filigree earrings by Lorraine Schwartz complement the colour of the dress perfectly. I also rather liked her gold filigree bracelet which looks a bit vintagey, but is very probably also by Lorraine Schwartz. All in all, a very deserving Gold Star candidate, in my opinion - what d&#39;you think ?!!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CAROLE BOUQUET</span></b>
Carole chose this glittery white halter-necked dress designed by Karl Lagerfeld for the Chanel Spring 2014 Couture Collection - isn&#39;t it lovely ?!! I love the column shape of this combined with the halter-neck design, and all the feathery embellishments and beading makes it glisten and gleam as she moves around.

She left her hair down and make-up nice and natural, which is ever the best way with Chanel&#39;s slightly more casual evening style these days. She chose gorgeous diamond hoop earrings that echoed the slightly 60s style of the dress. I love the back of the dress with the thin sequinned straps giving the back view some interest !! I do like it when designers think about the view all round...

Yes, yes - another Gold Star then...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ELENA LENINA</span></b>
Here is the Russian answer to Lady Gaga - Elena is a Russian reality TV star who is as batty as a fruitcake !! We love here at the Fashion Police Files as she is always entertaining and has become a bit of a fixture on the Cannes red carpet - she is completely over the top on the crazy scale !!
Here she chose this amazing bright red ball-gown, which is actually rather lovely in its own way, even though its a bit Prom-dressy. Her hair is as adventurous as ever - this time adorned with huge diamant&eacute; brooches and a marvellous paste tiara - it does occur to me though, that this is actually a big dome-shaped fake hairpiece, complete with its own dinky little crown, which she can put on over her own hair, which has been scraped up into a high bun underneath ? What d&#39;you reckon - real or fake ?!!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">FREDERIQUE BEL</span></b>
French film star Frederique Bel always makes a glamorous appearance on the red carpet during the Cannes Film Festival, and this time is no exception - here she is flashing a bit of thigh underneath a sheer spotty overdress with a split underskirt . I love this actually - it&#39;s frothy and fun, and yet it&#39;s truly glamorous and somewhat sophisticated all at the same time - confused ?

She has probably the best and most flawless make-up job I&#39;ve ever seen, combined with a gorgeous chignon hairdo adorned with straw ribbons at the back. Gigantic earrings and high platform shoes complete this amazing look !! Truly a Gold Star outfit...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JANE FONDA</span></b>
I&#39;ve said this before a few times, but it does bear saying again - La Fonda is looking stunning for her age !! She is currently all of 76 years old, and she is still turning heads on the red carpet !!
She chose this <i>beautiful</i> burgundy beaded gown designed by Elie Saab for his Autumn 2013 Couture Collection and managed to look a gazillion dollars in it !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KENDALL JENNER</span></b>
Kendal is one of the Kardashian Klan I believe, being sister to Kylie, and half sister to Kim, Khloe and Kourtney, of &#39;<i>At Home with the Kardashians</i>&#39; reality show&nbsp; fame. Kendall is a model, and a bit of a fashion designer along with her sis, Kylie - they design and apparently also inspire, a clothing range called Kendall &amp; Kylie <i>(quelle surprise)</i>...
All that notwithstanding, here she looked amazing in this rather interesting dress by Chanel, from the Resort 2014 Collection. I like this because of the intriguing bodice design - a black and white print on spiralling layers of frayed chiffon, giving it a bit if a feathered appearance.
I also really love her amazing silver earrings which may or may not involve diamonds, diamant&eacute; or crystals - anyway, they look pretty and sparkly, and a bit vintage 1980s...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LAETITIA CASTA</span></b>
Laetitia is a French model and actress, who in 1999, had the dubious honour of being ranked first in a national survey ordered by the French Mayors Association to decide who should be the new model for the bust of<i> Marianne</i>, an allegorical symbol of the French Republic, which stands inside every French town hall - that&#39;s like modelling for the Statue of Liberty, or maybe Britannia !!
She was also one of the jurors for last years Cannes Film Festival competition, and as such is invited back this year to attend various screenings. For the Opening Ceremony, she chose this amazing Christian Dior dress from their Spring 2014 Couture Collection, a design which I also chose as it happens !!
Remember Zoe&#39;s awful dress from the Met Ball, and how it ballooned round her hips - well, here is how to do that kind of thing the right way - this dress features a ballooned bodice gathered in at the back to a broad black band, giving the whole dress its unusual shape - not unflattering at all, and rather reminds me of vintage Courr&eacute;ges designs from the 1960s !! The train combined with the shorter front helps too, as does the interesting texture of the fabric.

<img alt=""Laetitia Casta 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/904864/904864_600.jpg"" title=""Laetitia Casta 01"" /> &nbsp; <img alt=""Laetitia Casta 01a"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/905138/905138_600.jpg"" title=""Laetitia Casta 01a"" />

With her hair over one shoulder, and gorgeous wine-red lipstick, she looks amazing - and here is the dress on the Dior runway, styled in a very similar way. Below is the back view showing the black bands that give the shape definition.

I like how she has styled her hair over one shoulder,&nbsp; and rolled and plaited at the back. She looks great in this outfit and gets a Gold Star to make up for the fact that her acting has been panned as being far too wooden...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">VALERIA MARINI</span></b>
Valeria is an Italian actress who is only 47 years old, but for some odd reason, is clearly partial to a bit of help from the surgeon&#39;s scalpel, thus resulting in a face that looks a tad too plumped up and a teensy bit lop-sided - (watch this space for future plastic surgery horror stories with her name on them...)
However, her choice of dress was lovely - this was a real confection in creamy layers which looked just lovely. Clutch bag, wrap, even her lipstick were all good choices - I can&#39;t say the same for her surgeon...

<img alt=""Valeria Marini 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/907428/907428_600.jpg"" title=""Valeria Marini 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Valeria Marini 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/907691/907691_600.jpg"" title=""Valeria Marini 02"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ZHANG ZIYI</span></b>
Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi made a fabulous entrance on the red carpet at this years opening ceremony, dressed in this unusual Stephane Rolland design - I like the fact that the bodice is so shiny black and futuristic-looking, but is then teamed with such a romantic ruffled skirt with a long train - somehow this works well, and I&#39;m not sure why really - it shouldn&#39;t, but it does !!

<img alt=""Zhang Ziyi 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/908166/908166_600.jpg"" title=""Zhang Ziyi 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Zhang Ziyi 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/908307/908307_600.jpg"" title=""Zhang Ziyi 02"" />

The bodice resembles futuristic armour-plating from a sci-fi movie with all those fine lines criss-crossing everywhere !! I like her bag with its knuckle-duster handle too...Alexander McQueen maybe ?

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ZOE SALDANA</span></b>
Zoe didn&#39;t impress me much at the Met Gala Ball, but here she looked lovely in this romantic frilled and finely pleated jersey dress, designed by Victoria Beckham, who appears to have gone all girly on us...
I liked this with the gilt belt and the huge gold-coloured earrings, which resemble some of my vintage 80s styles currently on hold over at my e-bay shop. (You can&#39;t see them at the moment, but will be able to soon !!) These beauties are very typical of the period, being huge, gold and dangly !!

<span style=""color:#ad1a1a;""><b><span style=""font-size: 1.8em;"">THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE ENTERTAINS !!</span></b></span>

Or more correctly, I should say, the fashion designer Ralph Lauren entertains, even though the Duke of Cambridge was the official host !! This dinner took place earlier this week, on a beautifully sunny evening after the rain stopped. All and sundry turned up to celebrate Ralph Lauren&#39;s philanthropic venture at the Royal Marsden Hospital, where the <i>Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research</i> opened this week.
<lj-cut>

Above is a photo of the St George Hall at Windsor, where a banquet was served to 220 guests, after a drinks reception in the Palace&#39;s Waterloo Chamber. Visitors to the castle will recognise this amazing hall at once, because if you&#39;ve been there, you won&#39;t forget it !!

The Duchess of Cambridge was not attending this event - part of a new strategy by the couple to divide their duties so they can be present at more events. There are rumours that Ralph Lauren was less than pleased about that !! However, I am not going to comment on this as that would be <i>pure speculation</i> from the likes of the Daily Mail !! I can however, tell you about his interest in the breast cancer research cause - here is a little bit from the Royal Marsden&#39;s own website:-

<i><span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><b>Ralph Lauren&rsquo;s support for cancer</b></span></i>
<p><i>Mr Ralph Lauren has long been recognised for his early leadership in the fight against breast cancer. More than 20 years ago, he made a personal and corporate commitment to finding a cure for this disease. He helped establish the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research at Georgetown University Medical Center, and designed the first &lsquo;target&rsquo; logo for the Council of Fashion Designers of America&rsquo;s successful Fashion Targets Breast Cancer international awareness campaign.</i></p><p><i>The Pink Pony range was launched on 15 September 2000 at the Ralph Lauren Spring 2001 Collection Fashion Show. At the same time a gift from the Ralph Lauren Corporation established the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention, a hospital-based cancer treatment facility in Harlem that provides comprehensive education, screening and diagnostic services for breast and other cancers, tailored to meet the specific needs of the Harlem community.

From October 2013, 25% of the sale of Pink Pony products in UK stores and on <a href=""http://www.ralphlauren.co.uk/family/index.jsp?categoryId=4809621&amp;size=99&amp;cp=3979771.3980501.4809621"">RalphLauren.co.uk</a> will benefit The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. Pink Pony will also be sold for the first time in Harrods. Find out more at the <a href=""http://global.ralphlauren.com/en-GB/about/philanthropy/pages/pink_pony.aspx"">Ralph Lauren website</a>.</i>
</p>So while the Duchess stayed in with Prince George, the Duke greeted a dazzling array of stars, which also included Benedict Cumberbatch, Kate Moss, Emma Watson, Mario Testino and Downton Abbey&rsquo;s Laura Carmichael.
Amongst hundreds of guests were a fine little selection of British models and a few stars of stage and screen, almost all of whom turned up in Ralph Lauren-designed finery, which is nice to see, as his work doesn&#39;t get worn that much on the red carpet !!
Here are the best of them...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CARA DELAVINGNE</span></b>
Cara looked her usual smouldering self, with kohl-rimmed eyes, in a black beaded halter top with a plain black skirt, and with herhair up in a top knot - she looked great in this, I thought, even though it was a much simpler design than most Ralph Lauren gowns.

<img alt=""Cara Delevingne 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/893968/893968_600.jpg"" title=""Cara Delevingne 01"" /> &nbsp; <img alt=""Cara Delevingne 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/894211/894211_600.jpg"" title=""Cara Delevingne 02"" />

<span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><b>CATE BLANCHETT</b></span>
Cate looked absolutely <i>stunning </i>in this gloriously pristine white dress and half cape, with crystal waterfall earrings and a white leather clutch. She is the epitome of style in this - and actually, I assumed this was a Giorgio Armani number, before I realised that this was essentially a bit of a Ralph Lauren do...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HELENA BONHAM-CARTER</span></b>
Helena looked her usual chaotic self, with a superbly flouncy strapless dress, and an updo to die for - using a piece of vintage jewellery in her hair is a great idea, depending on whether it&#39;s the right shape and in great condition- this particular piece looks like a vintage 50s brooch...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JESSICA MICHIBATA</span></b>
For those of you who don&#39;t know this is Jessica - an Argentine-Japanese model who has been dating racing driver Jensen Button for the last six years, and who she recently agreed to marry - just look at that amazing teardrop-shaped diamond !! She went with a show-stopping red gown with beautiful embroidery all down the bodice !

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LILY JAMES</span></b>
Downton Abbey actress Lily James chose an amazing black and silver gown, featuring a heavily embellished bodice and a black feathered skirt. She looked lovely in this actually and was easily one of the best dressed there. With her make-up and hair kept really simple, she kept all the attention on the dress. Ralph Lauren must have been so proud to see so many of his own designs looking so wonderful on all these young women !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">RALPH AND RICKY LAUREN</span></b>
Here he is - the man of the moment - with his wife of fifty years, Ricky Ann Loew Kauren, looking simply <i>resplendent</i> in one of his tiered white gowns with a silk jacket to match.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SOPHIE TURNER</span></b>
Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner came along in a beautiful one-shouldered black dress with fine pleating draping diagonally down the bodice, and into a finely pleated skirt - gorgeous stuff !!
Again, with a really simple hairdo and make-up, and a tiny beaded clutch,&nbsp; she looked wonderful !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ZHANG ZIYI</span></b>

I couldn&#39;t resist this event as it was on my own turf, so to speak, <i>and</i> in Windsor Castle - what&#39;s not to love ?!! Let&#39;s hope I can keep up with the events over in Cannes this weekend...

Welcome to the total freak show that is my Worst Dressed list - seriously, a couple of these dresses are not so bad, but most are truly <i>out there</i> in terms of fashion fails !! When it comes to interpreting a themed-ball like this, it seems some stars are in dire need of a course of fashion styling lessons !! And this was a relatively easy one...

<lj-cut text=""Come and see..."">

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">BRIE LARSON</span></b>
Brie was, sad to say, part of the Prada contingent - no less than three stars on this list were dressed by Prada, and I have to say, all were massive fails in my somewhat jaundiced view !! This was an outfit that looked like it had just got off a 1960s schlock-TV spaceship - far too glitzy, far too much busy embellishment, far too many sequins...

As for trousers, now you all know I don&#39;t mind trousers on a red carpet, but the brief was talking about <i>Charles James</i> here - probably the best designer of the big ball-gown in <i>history</i> - and that&#39;s a pretty long time !! If that isn&#39;t a brilliant excuse, I don&#39;t know what is...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KATE UPTON</span></b>
Kate saw the brief, and acted upon it at, so she at least was in a dress...however, Charles would turn in his grave if he could see this one - I mean, can anyone see anything else other than her rather over-displayed bosom ?!! It&#39;s actually a rather wonderful Dolce and Gabbana creation, but I would still venture to suggest that if you are anything over a size 36B, then perhaps a sheer bodice is not the best thing to be wearing to a huge red carpet event like this...

Accessory-wise, her jewellery is great - very vintage 1950s, with the matching coral bead necklace and earrings, but what&#39;s with the black lacey mob-cap ? She looks like something out of Blackadder !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LENA DUNHAM</span></b>
Oh Lena - when will you learn ?!! When will you finally find your perfect style...
This is a perfectly good dress actually - from Giambattista Valli - but it needs to be worn with a <i>perfect</i> set of pins, slim shoulders and a few other things that Lena just doesn&#39;t have - she has plenty of other assets which are great, but you can&#39;t actually see them...so here we have a dress that shows off her worst bits and hides the good ones !! There is a definite art to knowing what suits you and what doesn&#39;t - I would say that Lena would look great in a halter-neck column gown with a plunging neckline - show off the shoulders by all means, but be careful not to make your chest look like acres of bare flesh, with no necklace to relieve the expanse. If you are generously endowed, then the straight-across strapless design is possibly the worst shape you can choose.
This dress is great from the back actually, but from the front, it looks awkward and a bit uncomfortable.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LUPITA NYONG&#39;O</span></b>
Lupita has had a <i>spectacular</i> red carpet season, hasn&#39;t she ?!! What with all the beautiful gowns she wore to the major awards shows this year, culminating in that gorgeous baby-blue frock with acres of pleated skirt at the Oscars. That dress was designed by Prada and was simply stunning.
Here she is again, being dressed by Prada but what a difference !!

<img alt=""X Lupita Nyongo 01"" height=""594"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/888075/888075_600.jpg"" title=""X Lupita Nyongo 01"" width=""395"" /> &nbsp; <img alt=""X Lupita Nyongo 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/888471/888471_600.jpg"" title=""X Lupita Nyongo 02"" />

This was a bit of a let-down to say the least, although it&#39;s certainly interesting with it&#39;s slightly weird take on tribal beading, and while I do appreciate Lupita pushing the envelope, it just doesn&#39;t scream Met Ball at me - at all !! There&#39;s no denying that this dress involves a shed-load of work, what with all that hand-beading - and she<i> is</i> the current face of Prada, and this is a custom-designed dress, but all the same - is it right for such a high profile event ?
I would say - &#39;No - not nearly dressy enough !!&#39;
Very original and very noteworthy, but all the same - not nearly<i> dressy</i> enough !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MAGGIE GYLENHAAL</span></b>
Maggie, it pains me to say, nearly always makes it into this particular list, and the Met Ball for 2014 is sadly no exception !! This is simply hideous...and it&#39;s a Valentino too !!

Yes - this was designed by the Valentino duo, from their Autumn 2014 Collection, although on the runway they opened their show with a black, white, red and pink version of this graphic pop-art print from the 60s, and<i> that </i>was a whole lot more interesting, I have to say !! This slightly grungier brown, tan and dark green version came a little later in the runway show, and brought to mind the 1970s - lots of brown, rust and green and lots of large circles !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">NICOLE RICHIE</span></b>
Oh my Lord - what is it with this <i>Godawful </i>purple/grey hair colour ?!! Kelly Osborne has had it <i>forever</i>, and still looks a good three decades older than she should, and now Nicole Richie is going down the same road - why ?!!

I can&#39;t tell you how much I hate this look - it&#39;s just awful !! Young women making themselves look three or four decades older than they are, and for what ?!! Also, she is wearing a slinky Donna Karan Atelier number which looks amazing, if it were not quite so revealing around the side-boob area...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">RITA ORA</span></b>
Rita also chose a little Donna Karan number, and SO nearly nailed the red carpet with this look - ah, but then she went down the convoluted route of the criss-cross strapped gold satin ribbons - bad mistake !! This is almost never a great idea, simply because it looks so <i>unbelievably </i>tarty...and even more so when you cannot apparently get your wayward skirts under control !!

This could have so easily been a member of the elite Best Dressed list in here, but she let herself down with a surfeit of gold satin lacings.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SANDRA LEE</span></b>
This is definitely another of my &quot; Oh my<i> Good Gawd</i>&quot; moments - I mean, was she going for the Best Duvet impression or what ?!! This silver pouffy gown would have been <i>so</i> much better without the pouffy bits, don&#39;t you think ?!!.

Everything else is glamorous and well executed - her hair is gorgeous, and the silver elbow length gloves are <i>wonderful</i> - very Charles James !! The back of the dress is a fantastic concoction of tulle layers, but the overdone hip-rolls are way overdone, and not flattering at all.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SARAH JESSICA PARKER</span></b>
Sarah Jessica Parker was invited by Anna Wintour to co-host this bash with her this year, so SJP went all out for a memorable evening dress, designed, as if you couldn&#39;t guess, by Oscar de la Renta...
Everything about this whole outfit is amazing - the dress, the gloves, the jewellery - everything except for her<i> monumentally</i> unflattering hairstyle, which, while it&#39;s undoubtedly a great feat of hairstyling engineering, is making her head look, well,<i> square</i>...

I have to say that I&#39;m not that keen on designer&#39;s signatures all over the train of an evening gown like this - makes identifying it easy, but isn&#39;t a great look really !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SOLANGE KNOWLES</span></b>
Quite apart from her lapse of reason and her bad behaviour in the hotel lobby - I&#39;m sure that Beyonce&#39;s hubby needed a bit of a slap probably, but in front of the hotel&#39;s security cameras ?...really ??! That&#39;s just letting yourself down !!
Anyway - I digress...
She went for this peachy mid-calf length dress designed by 3.1 Philip Lim, and it&#39;s quite a nice dress really - not nearly dressy enough, but all the same. There is something about her hairstyle which is really bugging me - usually, a short crop like this looks modern and edgy, but something isn&#39;t quite right with this. It doesn&#39;t suit her face shape really - she has a rather square face and a strong jawline, so it&#39;s a tad sever for her I think. Is it a wig, because I actually wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some one told me it was ?

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">STACY MARTIN</span></b>
Stacy was one of the three women at this event wearing Prada for the evening - and what a bad mistake that proved to be. Miuccia Prada is a good designer for <span id=""cke_bm_142S"" style=""display: none;""> </span><i>some</i><span id=""cke_bm_142E"" style=""display: none;""> </span> <i>thing</i>s, mainly for day-wear - when it comes to evening-wear, her ideas are quite different from anyone else&#39;s, and sometimes rather puzzling !!
This get-up for example is not nearly dressy enough and also mismatched and weird - I mean who <i>really</i> puts red sequinned fabric with sheer turquoise wrap-over top that shows off your bra nicely, unless a world-renowned designer tells you to ?!!
 
<img alt=""Stacy Martin 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/893289/893289_600.jpg"" title=""Stacy Martin 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Stacy Martin 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/893571/893571_600.jpg"" title=""Stacy Martin 02"" />

Her earrings are great, but don&#39;t go with the skirt, and the whole outfit got almost everyone scratching their collective heads in puzzlement.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ZOE SALDANA</span></b>
Zoe usually looks amazing at these events, but I really have taken an intense dislike to this awful dress...it&#39;s not the print, which is rather pretty, and it&#39;s not the halter-neck bodice either, even though she is dangerously close to side-boob appearance.
I think it&#39;s that awkward bubbled skirt-shape actually...

I mean, it may well be Michael Kors, but that doesn&#39;t automatically make it good...it&#39;s not quite even all the way round, for one thing, and it&#39;s just not that flattering really...

<span style=""color:#3d3c3c;""><b><span style=""font-size: 1.8em;"">COMMEMORATING CHARLES JAMES...</span></b></span>

Charles <i>who ?</i>...
Well, it shames me to have to admit that that was my first reaction when I heard about the theme of this year&#39;s Met Ball !! This is, arguably, the biggest social event in the New York calendar, and is usually a themed event, the theme being the same as the Fashion Institute&#39;s major summer exhibition. This year&#39;s exhibition is &quot;<i>Charles James : Beyond Fashion&quot;</i>, and the general reaction to this has been very similar to mine...

<lj-cut>



<img alt=""a6"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/884005/884005_600.jpg"" title=""a6"" />

Here are some basic facts, and a link to get you up to speed on possibly one of the most <i>inventive</i> designers of all time - here is a man who inspired Christian Dior to create the New Look and was one of photographer Cecil Beaton&#39;s best friends. Crist&oacute;bal Balenciaga considered James &ldquo;<i>the only one in the world who has raised dressmaking from an applied art to a pure art.</i>&rdquo; High praise indeed !!


<img alt=""a4"" height=""450"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/884547/884547_600.jpg"" title=""a4"" width=""349"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""a5"" height=""450"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/884784/884784_600.jpg"" title=""a5"" width=""351.75"" />
<p><strong>1. He Got His Start Designing Hats</strong>: Born in 1906, James got his start in the fashion industry at the age of 19 when he opened up a hat shop in Chicago, using the name of one of his childhood friends, &quot;Charles Boucheron.&quot; Two years later he moved to New York and opened up a hat shop in Murray Hill.</p><p><strong>2. He Was Known For His Sexy Silhouettes</strong>: James typically worked with silk, velvet and organdy, and there was nothing prudish about his deigns. He was known for his signature ball gowns that played up a woman&#39;s figure instead of trying to conceal it.</p><p><strong>3. His Most Famous Gown Weighed 18 Pounds</strong>: James would give his gowns deliberately light, airy names like &quot;petal&quot; or &quot;butterfly,&quot; even though they were super heavy. His heftiest dress&mdash;&quot;The Butterfly Gown&quot;&mdash;weighed in at a whopping 18 pounds!</p><p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>He Had Friends in High Places</strong>: One of his best friends was Cecil Beaton, the famous <em>Vogue </em>fashion photographer. As he went further in his career, he earned high praise from fellow designers Crist&oacute;bal Balenciaga and Christian Dior, who once called him, &quot;the greatest talent of my generation.&quot;</p><p><strong>5. He Was a Partier Who Loved a Good Time</strong>: James was known for being a social butterfly and always made sure to attend the biggest galas and parties of the year. He even created a dress called &quot;The Taxi Dress&quot; that was designed so that you could easily change into it in a cab while you were en route to a party.</p><p><strong>6. He Wasn&#39;t the Best Businessman</strong>: While he was a creative genius, James famously fell short on the business end of things. He ultimately fell into $197,000 worth of debt and had his showroom seized by the IRS.</p><strong>7. His Legacy Lives On</strong>: James died in New York City in 1978 at the age of 72, but his legacy has lived on, influencing many designers after his time. He&#39;s getting his own Met gala, after all. The exhibit,<i> &quot;Charles James: Beyond Fashion</i>&quot; is showing at the Met from May 8 until August 10, 2014.

As promised, here&#39;s a link to the articles at Grazia magazine&#39;s website, which are very informative:

Cecil Beaton frequently used Charles James gowns in his photo-shoots for Vogue, as in this famous picture from New York, published in American Vogue in 1948.
As for the Met Gala Ball this year, the theme was a tribute to Charles James of course, and his classic Couture style - and how many stars honoured this theme
on the night, and how many threw it out of the window?!!

Well, many stars paid tribute to this amazing designer by wearing the biggest and most sumptuous ball-gowns they could borrow, attending the ball as guests of various fashion designers, as is the tradition at this event, and many of which have made it into my Best Dressed list here. Others ignored the theme and came in whatever they felt appropriate, much of which just wasn&#39;t...see my Worst Dressed list for the worst offenders in this category, which will be posted in a few days time.
For the time being though, all hail the Best Dressed of the evening - see if you agree...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ANNE HATHAWAY </span></b>
Anne unsurprisingly, went down the route of an elegant, straight up and down, column style, with this red gown by Calvin Klein. It may look like she has a bare midriff, but there is a sheer panel around her waist actually. She looked totally amazing in this - it suits her style and personality so well. I love her earrings too - dangly diamonds by Vhernier Pan di Zucchero, which I will be featuring in my jewellery blog about this ball soon.

All in all, and even amongst this esteemed company, she merits one of my Gold Stars for looking stunning !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ARIZONA MUSE</span></b>
Arizona was one of several A-list models who attended this event - here she is wearing a gorgeous raspberry-red silk gown designed by Ralph &amp; Russo, from their Spring 2014 Couture collection.
Ralph &amp; Russo are actually a design duo, Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo, who set up their business in London, designing Couture-standard fashion, and now they can boast that they are the only British house to be elected by the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture to show its collection on the official schedule at Paris Haute Couture Week, alongside brands such a Chanel, Dior and Valentino. The Chambre Syndicale&rsquo;s president, Didier Grumbach has been quoted saying &ldquo;<i>We expect savoir faire, which is being lost, and they [Ralph &amp; Russo] have it</i>&rdquo;.

I loved this amazing gown, and the way she styled it too - although her hair is a tad severe, it is a clean look, and throws the attention all on the dress. A delicate necklace and tiny diamond studs are all the jewellery needed here. A pearly white clutch by Smythson completes her look.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">BEE SHAFFER</span></b>
Anna Wintour&#39;s daughter usually makes an impressive entrance at this ball, and this evenng&#39;s bash was no exception. She wore a beautiful&nbsp; Alexander McQueen creation custom-designed for her, in pale watery blue silk, with a cascade of white tulle bursting forth from the split in the skirt, and a long train which flowed over the red carpet like a river of silk. No real close-ups, but I found a couple of pretty good close-ups expanded from full length photos over at Coco Perez.com...you can see the pleated bodice detail and just look at that gorgeous necklace !! She also went with what is clearly an Alexander McQueen clutch with its familiar knuckle-duster clasp.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">DITA VON TEESE</span></b>
Our saucy pal Dita went with an extremely sexy little curvaceous number from Zac Posen, of course, who is arguably Charles James&#39;s most worthy successor, in that he thinks in very much the same way. Figure-hugging but not too tight, and whilst not revealing, showing off curves in such a way that the woman wearing it is most definitely the sexiest woman in the room !! Dresses that have a classic couture construction, and underpinnings that hold the dress up by itself are features that only a few designers have the knowledge to create today. Dame Viv is one and Zac Posen is another.
Dita looked absolutely stunning in this unusual pale cream design, with red detailing, accentuating the design of the skirt and the lines of the bodice.

She went with a gorgeous gold and diamond vintage-looking knotted lariat-style necklace and a Roger Vivier clutch in red satin with a diamant&eacute; buckle.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">EMMY ROSSUM</span></b>
Emmy was one of the few stars who <i>didn&#39;t</i> go with the classic plain-coloured ball-gown, choosing instead to go with a bright floral print gown designed by Carolina Herrera. Now, I don&#39;t usually like this sort of thing, especially in yellow, but in this case it really suits the theme of the event, and Emmy wears it well. Really well...it takes a special kind of confidence to wear this kind of show-stopping print, which actually isn&#39;t Carolina&#39;s usual style, I must say, but Emmy carries it off superbly. She is wearing Van Cleef &amp; Arpel earrings too - fabulously mismatched in red which just about picks up the red in the print. Also, take a look at her amazing ring !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">GIOVANNA BATTAGLIA</span></b>
Giovanna Battaglia is the Italian ex-D &amp; G model who now edits L&#39;Huomo Vogue. She is one of the most stylish women in Italy, and loves a good ball like this. She wore a gorgeous, flower-strewn black tulle dress with a romantic off-the-shoulder neckline and a white lining to make it not so dark. This is from
the Dolce &amp; Gabbana Alta Moda Collection.

I loved her hair with all the pale pink roses to match her dress and the<i> totally</i> over the top butterfly necklace. This is definitely an outift to make an entrance in. The single matching butterfly earring gives it a slightly quirky edge, and completes the whole fairytale look of the ensemble.

<span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><b>IVANKA TRUMP</b></span>
Ivanka is the daughter of New York society beauty and businesswoman Ivana Trump and magnate husband Donald, who have both attended this event many times in the past - now Ivanka attends regularly and nearly always makes it into my Best Dressed lists.she has inherited her mother&#39;s good looks, and taste for amazing jewellery - she heads her own organisation, Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry. The Ivanka Trump Lifestyle Collection also includes fragrance, footwear, handbags, outerwear and eyewear collections.
She went for high octane glamour with this beautiful green brocade gown designed by Oscar de la Renta, which, although not a huge ballgown, is such a rich shade of glossy green that it really stands out as being unusual. She picked huge chandelier diamond earrings to go with her amazing high bun hairdo - very likely from her own collections, no doubt, and rich red lipstick to set it all off - truly gorgeous stuff !!

<span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><b>JANELLE MONAE</b></span>
Janelle was one of many stars who tried to interpret the theme by going with something that defined Charles James&#39;s thought processes rather than emulating his high Couture ballgown style - in other words, her outfit reflected the fact that he was very inventive as well as dramatic, and didn&#39;t shy away from going in the opposite direction from what was expected of him. Here, she chose this red embroidered full-length cape, designed by Tadashi Shoji, from his Autumn 2014 Collection, and teamed it with black trousers and a high-necked white blouse in the Russian style, with a huge diamant&eacute; brooch, and ultra-high strappy sandals.
I loved this whole outfit for its drama and its originality, in the face of so many conventional ballgowns - she really stood out, and Charles James would have been proud !!

<span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><b>KARLIE KLOSS</b></span>
Model Karlie Kloss also went for an Oscar de la Renta gown from the same collection as Ivanka&#39;s - and it shows. If you didn&#39;t know they came from the same designer, you could probably guess !! The brocade is very similar, just black and gold instead of shades of green, and they are both strapless ballgowns with trains. Karlie chose to wear over-the-elbow black evening gloives - how very 1950s !! I love them, and I was very happy to see several stars wearing them here...

<img alt=""Karlie Kloss 01"" height=""633.6945107398568"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/874551/874551_600.jpg"" title=""Karlie Kloss 01"" width=""447"" /> &nbsp; <img alt=""Karlie Kloss 02"" height=""633"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/875258/875258_600.jpg"" title=""Karlie Kloss 02"" />

Karlie gave what is a very retro outfit - classic brocade ballgown and very vintage-looking diamant&eacute; necklace and earrings - a modern gloss with her short side-swept haircut, and well-defined but neutral make-up. A gold star-worthy get-up, for sure !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KYLIE MINOGUE</span></b>
Everyone&#39;s favourite singer, Kylie went with this beautiful white gown embossed with gold embroidery, from those good girls at Marchesa - this was custom-designed by them for Kylie and therefore suits her diminutive height and svelte figure beautifully. I liked this a lot, as simply a very pretty dress, and I also liked her pretty hairstyle, swept back from her face and framing it at the same time.
Marchesa also supplied her with a sparkly box-clutch, and Harry Winston supplied her with jewellery.Pretty diamond earrings really complemented her hair-colour and style.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LILY ALDRIDGE</span></b>
Model Lily looked a million dollars in this gorgeous glitzy dress, designed by Michael Kors. I was drawn to this immediately, mainly because of the way it&#39;s pooling round her feet - usually, this would be very difficult to walk in, but Lily is a consummate professional in that respect, and doesn&#39;t let the mere fact of too much length get her down !! Basically, she didn&#39;t trip over it, so that&#39;s OK then...
She kept everything ewlse fairly simple, as the usually the way with my best dressed list , with a simply updo and a well-defined but neutral make-up job. She looked glamorous without looking over-the-top, which is what everyone wants to aim for when getting all dressed up for a special event like this !!

The other thing I loved about this look was the amazing necklace. As I am wheeling and dealing in vintage jewellery on e-bay at the moment, I have a special interest in the jewellery choices of all the stars here, and will be writing a special post regarding this over at my jewellery blog <a href=""http://vintagejewelleryfun.wordpress.com/"">http://vintagejewelleryfun.wordpress.com/</a>.

This necklace is really beautiful, and very original in its design - a series of circles linked together with droplet diamonds hanging down in the centre of each link - beautiful !!.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LIU WEN</span></b>
Liu Wen&#39;s choice was also immediately recognisable to me too - this is one of Zac Posen&#39;s creations, from his &nbsp;&nbsp; Collection, chosen by me at the time. She looks great in it and styled it well with crystal drop earrings and a box-clutch in black satin.. I have said before that Zac is possibly the natural modern successor to Charles James, because of his love of the female form and his general practice of using the traditional ball-gown shape interpreted in a thoroughly modern way. Exagerrated shapes and unusual design details make his work stand out from the crowd, even such a fashion crowd as this !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MONICA BELLUCCI</span></b>
Italian actress Monica Bellicci attended this ball accompanied by Roberto Bolle, who is the principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre, and clearly a good friend of Monica&#39;s. She looked fantastic in a gorgeous red lace column dress and matching cape designed by Dolce and Gabbana. This suits her extrememly well, especially the drama of the cape highlighted by that extravagant necklace - how utterly gorgeous is that ?!!

I particularly chose these pics of Monica with her co-attendee, Roberto Bolle, mainly because I couldn&#39;t resist showing his amazing jewelleed gauntlets - just look at those fancy gloves !! I wouldn&#39;t mind betting that they areo from messrs D &amp; G, as they certainly look like their style !!Defintely worthy of including in my Best Dressed list even though he&#39;s male - that doesn&#39;t matter at all...truthfully, the dress code for the men at this ball was White Tie, which most of the men happily complied with, and a few really ran with - at high speed, out the door, over the hill and far away !! Roberto was one of them...his gloves, and his shoes too, really say it all !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">RIHANNA</span></b>
Rihanna was another of the stars at this event who really interpreted the theme well in my opinion - she stood out for her beautifully elegant and simple white split column-gown, with its draping around her derri&eacute;re, and the quirky inventive style in which she wore it. This was designed by her pal Stella McCartney, as a custom design, and i really love the whole shape of this, especially the triple panel flying away behind her. I also loved her beautiful collar necklace, and hair jewels holding her hair up in its high, messy updo.
This whole ensemble suits Rihanna&#39;s personality so well, and I&#39;m so glad she didn&#39;t go with a huge ball-gown, as she would have simply looked like everyone else, and that&#39;s definitely not her style !!

In keeping with her unconventional style, she filled her fingers with silver and diamond rings and sported visible tattoos everywhere - not very 1950s but that&#39;s OK - she doesn&#39;t have to look like a 1950s Vogue model to fulfill the theme of this ball. Elegance and glamour are the order of the day, and teaming this with an unconventional approach to styling is a definite plus !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SARAH SILVERMAN</span></b>
I didn&#39;t get this identified, but I am willing to bet that this might be another Zac Posen gown - the whole look of it suggests that it might well be - it looks like one of his, doesn&#39;t it ?!! Severe hairdo aside, I liked her in this, even though I kind of wished that she had gone for a big necklace, just like they would have back in the 50s. I think it would have finished this off nicely...
I loved the gown though, mainly because it reminds me of &quot;<i>Gone With the Wind&quot; -</i> it has a real Southern belle look about it...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SELENA GOMEZ</span></b>
Selena Gomez has been criticised a lot in this journal, and elsewhere too, for often choosing dresses and hairstyles that age her terribly - this isn&#39;t one of those occasions !! She looked amazing here, in her custom-designed dress by Diane von Furstenberg, which is both elegant and youthful, and a lovely colour for her. A rich deep plummy burgundy really enhances her beautiful skintone and rich auburn hair.
For once, her hair doesn&#39;t look matronly - instead she had it done up in a graceful and interesting chignon, in the nape of her neck, with plenty of volume on the top of her head by virtue of the way it has been twisted over her crown and down the back - beautifully done actually, and worthy of Best Hairstyle I reckon, even though Janelle Monae has that accolade this time around.

I also loved her amazing earrings, by Lorraine Schwartz - aren&#39;t they gorgeous ?!! Her make-up is also very good, with flawless skin and plummy burgundy lipstick perfectly matched to her dress. And she&#39;s carrying a muff - <i>a muff !! </i>What&#39;s not to love...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">TAYLOR SWIFT</span></b>
Taylor looked gorgeous in this pale pink embroidered gown designed by Oscar de la Renta, who has had an amazing showing at this event thus far !! She looked lovely in this with her hair styled over one eye and flawlessly perfect make-up - rich red lipstick gave the palest pink of the dress a bit of oomph, and well-defined eyes gave her face a bit of sparkle. Diamond earrings finished this off beautifully.
I love the shape of this dress with the bustle-bow and the train rippling out behind her. Oscar did himself proud with this one...

Well, that was my Best Dressed list, done in alphabetical style, as I always do, but this time, in addition, I thought I&#39;d save my own personal favourite until last, in order to award my coveted Gold Crown to the Belle of the Ball - so without further ado, here I give you, the Best Dressed of them all...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KAROLINA KURKOVA</span></b>
Out of all the beautiful ball-gowns on show here, this one surely takes the proverbial biscuit !! This is dramatic, gorgeous, and original in every way, and in my humble opinion, Karolina Kurkova really nailed the theme <i>and</i> the spirit of Charles James&#39;s style. It&#39;s a ball-gown in the spirit of the 50s, but very modern and highly original too - eye-catching and drefinitely worthy of my Gold Crown as the Best Dress of the ball.
This might be recognisable to you if you read this blog on a regular basis, because I featured this dress when it was shown as part of Marchesa&#39;s Spring 2011 show a few years ago. I loved it then and I love it now...

The sheer sculptural quality of this amazing gown is shown off to perfection with Karolina keeping everything else pretty simple, but equally dramatic - a rare styling skill. Her hair up in a top-knot keeps the attention on the dress, and a beautiful floral design diamond necklace by Harry Winston complements the dress but doesn&#39;t detract from it. Like I said, styling this dress would be a difficult thing, but whoever chose the jewellery should be proud of their talents here !!

These were all the stars and models who I thought interpreted the theme of this ball the best, but of course, there were plenty of other attendees who looked amazing too, in their own way, just not in the spirit of the theme necessarily - others tried their best to interpret the theme, but made a complete pig&#39;s ear of it - and they made it in spectacular fashion, into my Worst Dressed list !!</span></span>

So keep a look out for my next post regarding the Worst Dressed List, and my Best Jewellery and Accessories at the Met Ball post over at my fairly new jewellery blog:-

I have just posted a fascinating little piece about 2 really pretty brooches I obtained on e-bay recently, that have been proving a bit of a mystery to me - I have discovered the information about the first, so come and see if you can shed some light on the second !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">1964 - 2014</span></b>

I am totally shocked - and deeply saddened - to learn of the tragic death of amazing American fashion designer L&#39;Wren Scott, who has been found dead in her Manhattan apartment this morning. She was found hanged with a silk scarf in an apparently successful suicide bid.<p>Scott texted her assistant at 8:30 a.m. and requested that she come over, police sources said. When she arrived, she let herself into the apartment with a key, found the body and called 911. Police do not suspect foul play, a source said, but the Medical Examiner&rsquo;s Office will determine a cause of death. No suicide note was found.</p>She was only 49...

<lj-cut>

Of course, it&#39;s also well known that she is the long-term girlfriend of Sir Mick Jagger, currently on tour with the Rolling Stones over in Australia at the moment - Jagger said via a spokesperson that he is &quot;<i>completely shocked and devastated by the news&quot;</i> of her death. When asked if there were still in a relationship at the time of her death, he replied &lsquo;<i>of course</i>&rsquo;.

She went on to pose for notable brands such as Thierry Mugler and Chanel, before moving to California in the early &lsquo;90s and establishing herself as a sought-after stylist.</p><p>After establishing her reputation as a successful stylist, she decided to launch her own fashion brand in 2006. Sarah Jessica Parker, Angelina Jolie, Nicole Kidman have all worn her gowns to the Academy Awards, while other high-profile names such as Reese Witherspoon, Christina Hendricks, Sandra Bullock and even First Lady Michelle Obama have been seen wearing her designs.

Her work can also be seen on the big-screen: she designed the costumes for 1996&rsquo;s &ldquo;<span id=""cke_bm_80S"" style=""display: none;""> </span><i>Diabolique,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ocean&rsquo;s Thirteen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Eyes Wide Shut</i><span id=""cke_bm_80E"" style=""display: none;""> </span>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Shine a Light,</i>&rdquo; Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s documentary about The Rolling Stones.<span id=""cke_bm_81E"" style=""display: none;""> </span></p><p><img alt=""L&amp;amp;#39;Wren Scott 14"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/566903/566903_original.jpg"" title=""L&amp;amp;#39;Wren Scott 14"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""L&amp;amp;#39;Wren Scott 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/563520/563520_original.jpg"" title=""L&amp;amp;#39;Wren Scott 01"" />

This was fairly typical of her design style - from the Spring/Summer 2014 RTW Collection shown in London Fashion Week last Autumn !!

L&#39;Wren Scott was one of my favourite red carpet designers from New York, and I was so happy that she decided to relocate her fashion shows to London a few seasons back, as I felt that it really raised the profile of London as a fashion destination, and heightened the feeling that London was <i>the</i> city to be in. This season, in February, she announced she had cancelled her London Fashion Week show for Autumn 2014, for no apparent reason, which only serves to deepen the mystery..</p>

The Oscar viewing parties hosted by Vanity Fair magazine are legendary of course, and if you&#39;re any kind of star in La-la-land, and you don&#39;t get that coveted invitation to the actual ceremony, then this is the place to be and to be seen !! The other big party of course, is hosted by Elton John in aid of his charity, the AIDS Foundation, and many stars get to go to both if they possibly can. The red carpet at the Vanity Fair Party has a <i>much</i> nicer back-drop than the AIDS Foundation Party, so I concentrated on that one and added in any stars then caught my eye from the other one if necessary. In the event, my Top Fifteen stars came from the Vanity Fair do, as did the five Worst Dressed fashion victims too...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ALISON BRIE</span></b>
Alison went with the prettiest, and most Spring-like dress at the party - this was a Giambattista Valli gown, and one of several pretty floral print dresses that made an appearance at this party. I liked this a lot and thought it suited her very well - it&#39;s nice to see prints on the red carpet for a change. Styled with her hair up in a messy chignon, and barely there make-up, she looked fantastic !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ANNE HATHAWAY</span></b>
Anne really wowed me for a second time when she changed out of her Gucci gown, and into this rather striking little Viktor &amp; Rolf number. This really took my attention and made me take a sharp Intake of breath - always a good sign, frankly !! I thought she looked stunning in this - it really suited her inherehtly modern style on the red carpet - she always goes for these slender column gowns that have a slightly edgy modern look about them. With her ultra-short cropped hair, and well-defined make-up, she looked fresh, youthful and very eye-catching !!

I loved her clutch - it was from Roger Vivier&#39;s <i>&#39;Paint-box</i>&#39; collection, and had an interesting geometric Art Deco look about it. This was easily one of the best outfits at the party in my view and so she gets another big gold star for her second fashion choice of the evening !!

Model/actress Crystal Renn accompanied designer Zac Posen to this party and wore one of his best evening creations - I guessed this was a Zac Posen design, even before I saw the video of them arriving together - it is a stunningly beautiful gown and very 1950s in the way the collar forms a swathe of satin draped gracefully around the shoulders, and dips down to the centre front and probably goes straight across the back below the visible shoulder line.

<img alt=""A Crystal Renn 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/852458/852458_original.jpg"" title=""A Crystal Renn 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""A Crystal Renn 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/852559/852559_original.jpg"" title=""A Crystal Renn 02"" />

She styled this in the fiercest way possible with striking Lorraine Schwartz Art Deco-style earrings, ultra-vampy burgundy lipstick, kohl-rimmed eyes that had that 1950s flick, and the black nails, and a stunning vintage fan-shaped beaded bag that had a real 1930s look about it. What an extraordinarily striking look all round !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ELIZABETH BANKS</span></b>
Elizabeth Banks chose a beautiful powder-blue Jenny Packham outfit from the Autumn 2014 Collection, comprising an interesting feathery skirt, and a matching beaded top that had been modified from the original runway version by having quite a lot chopped off the hem. The runway one came down to the model&#39;s hips, but I prefer this one completely - it&#39;s much more flattering and shows off the top half of the skirt.

She looked lovely with her blonde hair cropped short, a pair of snaky ear-cuffs, the newest trend in earrings, and a matching powder-blue purse-style clutch, with a gorgeous silver ring set with a powder-blue stone - this is how to do matchy-matchy really well, with interesting details, and lots to look at !! She wore silver high-heeled court shoes (they&#39;re the ones with mid to high heels, low-cut fronts and pointy toes) which set off the whole outfit perfectly !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">EVAN RACHEL WOOD</span></b>
Evan Rachel Wood looked absolutely beautiful in a real 1930s way with this gorgeous, dark emerald-green, beaded Elie Saab gown from his Autumn 2013 Couture Collection. The colour is fabulous for her, with her reddish-chestnut hair colour, and flawless creamy complexion. She had her hair cut into a short, slightly shingled jaw-length bob, which completed the 1930s look.

She went with bright zingy red nails and lipstick to compliment the green colour of the dress, and matched the green with her clutch and sported a beautiful square-cut emerald and diamond ring. This whole look was well thought out and did her stylist proud - I&#39;m assuming that she has a stylist - she may not of course, but most stars do !! Either way, this definitely deserves one of my gold stars !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HEIDI KLUM</span></b>
This is yet another Atelier Versace creation worn at the Oscars and the Oscars parties. This one is from the Spring 2014 Collection, which I picked out at when I looked at Couture Fashion Week a few weeks back. Heidi looked fabulous in it, even though her hair-style is a tad severe. Other people have commented that the bust area looks too tight, but I disagree - this dress&#39;s corset underpinning has a real &#39;push-up &amp; together&#39; action which is what Heidi wanted - a real cleavage on show here !! I must admit though, that it would have made a really nice change to see the dress worn together with it&#39;s little jacket, as in the runway photo below - that would have been interesting !!

I loved her statement ear-cuff earring which is unusual and eye-catching, and the fact that it&#39;s only worn in one ear - the other on has a simple black stud.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JULIE CHEN</span></b>
Julie is an anchorwoman for CBS, and attended this party in that capacity, accompanied by her husband Leslie Moonves, CEO of CBS. She looked wonderful in a red embroidered gown that looks familiar as it&#39;s very similar to designs by various designers, Reem Acra and Marchesa to name but two - I don&#39;t know who designed this but it&#39;s very pretty !! I like the slightly square neckline, what we call a portrait neckline because of the similarity to 18th Century portraits !!

She dressed this gown up with the prettiest of vintage earings which look like marquisite, but are probably tiny chip diamonds, and garnets She also carried a beaded clutch and wore a silver ball bracelet. I really like the back view of this dress, with it&#39;s illusion bare-back, and garland of flowers across the neckline. All in all, a very successful outfit for the CBS TV presenter, and therefore worthy of one of my gold stars !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KATE HUDSON</span></b>
Kate got changed out of her amazing Versace gown/cape that she wore to the Oscars, and into this beautiful Zuhair Murad design from his Spring 2014 Collection - a nude fishtail dress, heavily embroidered with black beads and sequins - this is one gorgeous gown !! I love how the neckline is actually round, but the beading gives it a very much more interesting shape !!

Kristen also got changed out of her amazing Roberto Cavalli gown, and into this beautiful red dress, which was also designed by Zuhair Murad, but from the Spring 2014 RTW collection instead of his Spring 2014 Couture collection, as it happens !! She looked lovely in this with her hair still up in that bun, and a bit of red lipstick instead of the pinky colour she wore at the awards ceremony.

Sporting the same diamond earrings and a red beaded clutch, she produced the second brilliant outfit of the evening. It has become common practice to change your dress, and anything else that goes with it, for another designer gown for the second event of the evening. Twice the endorsement I guess - I don&#39;t know whether the designers actually <i>pay </i>the actresses to wear their dresses, but I do know the dresses are only borrowed, for the most part !! Some actresses can afford to buy their own couture and designer dresses, and don&#39;t bother with endorsements at all, but they are only the highest paid stars. Sensibly, any actress would borrow an amazing dress, usually arranged by their stylist, rather than pay out for their own, probably only to wear it once !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LADY GAGA</span></b>
Here&#39;s a typical example of a star endorsing a designer&#39;s work - Lady Gaga has been invited to take up the challenge of being the Face of Versace, and therefore will be wearing their evening-wear dresses to events like this, with or without her own slightly out-there stamp on it. This is the second Versace dress from the Spring 2014 Atelier Versace Collection she appeared in during the course of the evening. I must admit I didn&#39;t like this one quite as much as the first, but it&#39;s still a lovely dress. Very revealing and very edgy, but that&#39;s very much the Versace look after all. Lots of white straps revealing much bare skin and tattoos, and lots of rectangular crystal barrettes to vamp it up with a bit of sparkle.

<img alt=""X Lady Gaga 01"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/862291/862291_original.jpg"" title=""X Lady Gaga 01"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""X Lady Gaga 02"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/862668/862668_original.jpg"" title=""X Lady Gaga 02"" />

For Lady Gaga, the make-up was extraordinarily natural and very feminine, with white sparkly eye shadow and fake lashes. Lovely diamond earrings and really eye catching cuffs with emerald stones, and a ring to match, was the topping on the cake !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MIRANDA KERR</span></b>
Miranda went with this spectacularly beautiful, shimmery silver textured-satin halter-necked gown, from the Kaufmann Franco Autumn 2014 RTW Collection. Again, this is a dress I picked up on when I went to see the New York Fashion Week photos, but I just haven&#39;t got round to writing it up yet !! She looked every inch the star in this, especially with the loose hair and the sparkly diamond earrings. Natural but well-defined make-up with red lipstick really made this gown stand out - this kind of dress needs a strong lip colour otherwise you do stand the danger of fading into the background.

Here&#39;s this dress on the Kaufmann Franco runway, and as you can see, the model has a natural lip colour and not very much eye make-up and doesn&#39;t look nearly as good as Miranda !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">NAOMIE HARRIS</span></b>
Naomie chose a wonderful, heavily embroidered gown, with bright red on a black base fabric which made it really stand out. This was from the Naeem Khan Autumn 2014 RTW Collection, also shown in the aforementioned New York Fashion Week, and yes - it&#39;s also one I picked out !!&nbsp; I liked this because it&#39;s unusual - a rather different take on the embroidered-all-over type of evening gown that several different designers have experimented with over the last few years !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SOFIA VERGARA</span></b>
Sophie looked her usual million dollar self in this gorgeous white fishtail halter-neck gown from Roberto Cavalli - this is so much her usual style and yet she looked pretty covered up with that halter neckline. I liked this for a change actually but it still put forward a sexy look which is very much her trade mark !!

I really loved her white satin Rodo clutch bag - very stylish indeed, and I loved the textured fabric on the body of the dress - gold beading around the waist combined with&nbsp; parallel lines of stitching, like pin-tucks gave the dress an unusual look.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ZOOEY DESCHANEL</span></b>
I loved Zooey&#39;s pretty floral print dress - layers and layers of ruffles with little spots and multi-coloured flowers gave her a romantic summery look !! This was from the Oscar de la Renta Spring 2014 Collection, and really stood out amongst al the sophisticated plain-coloured evening gowns. I liked the fact that she had her hair down which suited the more casual nature of the dress and went for plain pearl jewellery and a red satin and diamant&eacute; shoulder bag. That made a change from the usual clutch bag option.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">THE WORST DRESSED</span></b>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">DIANE KRUGER</span></b>
I was pretty surprised at Diane&#39;s choice of dress for this event - usually she looks flawless for these ocasions, but I&#39;m afraid this monstrosity was a total mess. It looked for all the world as if she had taken her boudoir&#39;s black lacey curtains and draped themselves around herself and tied it in the middle - shapeless and unflattering, the high neckline did nothing for her amazing figure, and the below elbow-length lseeves looked wide and unfinished. Sadly this was a Valentino design from the Spring 2014 Collection and one which I most certainly didn&#39;t pick out !! This should have looked miles better than it did - and I have to say that others really liked it, but it just didn&#39;t do anything for me at all, which just goes to show that just because it&#39;s a Valentino doesn&#39;t necessarily make it good !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ELLEN PAGE</span></b>
Ellen Page went for the masculinbe tux look designed by Hedi Slimane for the Saint Laurent label - again, this is a look which didn&#39;t do it fopr me at all - mainly because,&nbsp; just like Angelina Jolie at the BAFTAs a few weeks ago, I felt this was an occason that demanded a bit more of a formal outfit, nore dressing up than this, It&#39;s not that it looked oarticularly bad, but I reckon she should have made more of an effort. I&#39;m all for trousers on the red carpet as I feel it makes a good change sometimes, but it should be something more than a traditional black tuxedo - after all, we have more than enough men on the red carpet dressed like this already !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MAMIE GUMMER</span></b>

Not a good look at all...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">OLIVIA MUNN</span></b>
Olivia chose this dress from a vintage selection - this was designed by Alexander McQueen, and I&#39;m convinced I&#39;ve seen this before - worn by someone else maybe, but it looks familiar, from another Worst Dressed scenario too !! I hated it then and I hated it here - it looks like a real corset contraption, a sort of Victorian torture S &amp; M device maybe - well, it has that look doesn&#39;t it ?!! The fact that this halter thing rings her breasts, and really calls attention to them, just made me go <i>&quot;WTF ?!!&quot;</i>
Out loud too...

That&#39;s it for my Worst Dressed list - as you can see, not many, for much the same reasons as before I guess. These days, there are often quite a few dress choices that I don&#39;t really like but aren&#39;t inherently bad, which won&#39;t make the list. They simply aren&#39;t bad enough !! 

Next up will be my look at New York Fashion Week, since I already given you a sneak preview of some of my choices...

Yes - it&#39;s Oscars time again !! This year, the Kodak Theatre venue has been temporarily renamed the Hollywood &amp; Highland Center, after the sad demise of the Kodak company last year, but it&#39;s still the same huge auditorium / theatre entertainment and shopping complex.
I have been hard at work sifting through all the red carpet pics, sorting out the very best and the very worst of the fashion choices from last night !! There were some very popular colour choices that came up again and again - plain white and plain black were the most popular, most of which came with beading, sequins, pleating, or lace !! As for colours, there were a few reds, but on the whole, pastel shades were out in force...peach, pale pink, pale blue and silvery-grey. Of course, there were some<i> spectucalar </i>jewellery and accessories on show too - I will be doing a special on them over at my jewellery blog here:-
<a href=""http://vintagejewelleryfun.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://vintagejewelleryfun.wordpress.com/</a>
Do come and have a look, when you have a moment !!
In the meantime, come and see what everyone wore, and what some perhaps shouldn&#39;t have worn...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">AMY ADAMS</span></b>
One of my red carpet favourites, Amy always seems to come up trumps !! I really like her style - very elegant, and classy. Here she chose a very understated look indeed with this midnight blue gown with sleek tailoring details. A very fitted dress this, with a beautiful hourglass shape and an absolutely flawless fit. This is silk crepe which is a heavy fabric, given to taking flat details well like collars, cuffs, and pockets, so it&#39;s a great choice for this design. This was a custom design from Gucci Premi&egrave;re - a label that is doing extremely well in the red carpet stakes these days !!

She chose red drop earrings with diamonds and sapphires from Tiffany &amp; Co&#39;s Blue Book collection, and wore them with her hair swept up in a coiled French plait - an elegant style to suit the dress !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ANGELINA JOLIE</span></b>
To say I was less than impressed with La Jolie&#39;s look at the BAFTAs would be an understatement, but here she really wowed me with this beautiful shimmering beaded column dress designed by Elie Saab, from his Autumn 2013 Couture Collection. She didn&#39;t overdo the hair or make-up either, with subtle peachy lip-gloss and kohl-rimmed eyes, and her huge diamond earrings are exceptionally fab !! She looks every inch the Hollywood star in this, and so I award her a big gold star for effort !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ANNA KENDRICK</span></b>
Anna went off to J.Mendel for her lovely black and red gown, which will be one of the ones I feature when I look at New York Fashion Week later on. This was one of&nbsp; three dresses that featurd these embroidery-embellished panels - one in white with black, one in green with black, and this one which is my favourite of the three !!

She styled this beautiful but edgy gown with a dark red clutch, burgundy nails and gorgeous drop earrings featuring black stones with diamonds. With her hair up and&nbsp; make-up quite understated except for her red lipstick, she looked perfect !! She gets a gold star for looking absolutely amazing, and also a zebra star for choosing a dress that I also chose when I looked at the runway photos !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ANNE HATHAWAY</span></b>
Anne looked absolutely exceptional at the Oscars last night, with this amazing black dress embellished with huge triangular crystals decorating the halter bodice front - designed by Gucci, this was by far one of the best designs of the evening - edgy and glamorous, modern and stylish, and very in keeping with her short haircut and the amazing diamond ear-cuffs she was also wearing - they were fab !!
Hmm, yes - a gold star here too, I think...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">BETTE MIDLER</span></b>

Wow - I haven&#39;t seen Bette on a red carpet for years - and yet, here she is !! She went for a fabulous figure-hugging red lace dress designed by Reem Acra, who had a pretty good night at the Oscars this year !! I love Bette&#39;s style with her hair swept up into a modern updo, and beautiful,<i> beautiful</i> vintage-looking earrings - she looked great !!

Here is her lovely dress on the Reem Acra runway - from my own files as I chose this too when I looked at New York Fashion Week.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CATE BLANCHETT</span></b>
Cate never disappoints or bores me with her red carpet style - granted, she sometimes chooses dresses that I hate, but mostly she chooses dresses I love, and sometimes she inspires and excites too - this time she looked as beautiful as usual, but went for a very pretty look rather than her usual elegant sophisticated style. Yes, it was a Armani Priv&eacute; gown, but a pretty pastel one, embellished with massive degrad&eacute; paillettes and gold Swarovski crystal baguettes which gave the whole dress a shimmery glittery look as she walked.

<img alt=""Cate Blanchett 01"" height=""594"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/822562/822562_original.jpg"" title=""Cate Blanchett 01"" width=""403"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Cate Blanchett 02"" height=""594"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/822953/822953_original.jpg"" title=""Cate Blanchett 02"" width=""411"" />

She left her hair down and wore the most <i>fabulous</i> huge opal cluster earrings, that came from Chopard -&nbsp; they look incredibly heavy actually, and no doubt, worth a fortune !! Very natural make-up and a loose, softly waved hairstyle made this look perfect - truly gold-star-worthy !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CHARLIZE THERON</span></b>
Charlize went for her usual choice of a spectacular Christian Dior Couture gown, which <i>was</i> absolutely stunning - the bodice was immaculately cut and fitted her like a glove, and the skirt was column-shaped with a sheer over-layer flaring out from the knee, with deep pleats - very unusual. I wasn&#39;t too sure about the nude shoulder straps at first, but they didn&#39;t really detract too much from the dress as a whole !! This is a very contemporary take on a classic evening gown, and the ultra-short haircut suited the style fabulously well. I also liked her diamond lariat necklace from Harry Winston - again, a very contemporary style to go with the dress !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CHRISSY TIEGEN</span></b>
Here&#39;s another fabulous contemporary design - this one is from the Monique L&#39;Huillier Autumn 2014 Collection, the photo for which is languishing in my picture files ready for my post about New York Fashion Week - so you can have a sneak preview of some of the styles that took my fancy a few weeks ago when New York Fashion Week was on. I really liked this as it was a classic evening gown shape with a modern splashy print - on the whole, we don&#39;t see that many prints on the red carpet, and we usually see Chrissy in slinky fitted gowns, so this makes a great change !! The print looks like pink cherry blossoms falling from the sky, against a black background giving it a very modern edge.

<img alt=""Chrissy Teigen 01"" height=""594"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/823622/823622_original.jpg"" title=""Chrissy Teigen 01"" width=""437"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Chrissy Teigen 02"" height=""594"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/824002/824002_original.jpg"" title=""Chrissy Teigen 02"" width=""437"" />

Chrissy styled this with the most amazing Chopard earrings - a triple-drop of diamond flower-clusters designed by Lorraine Schwartz - and the highest of high Jimmy Choo shoes. Below is this dress on the runway...she gets a zebra star as I picked this one out from the Dior show !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">GIULIANA RANCIC</span></b>
Giuliana is the anchorwoman for E! News and co-hosts the <i>&#39;Fashion Police</i>&#39; red carpet report along with Kelly Osbourne and a few others - their Oscars commentary is an annual must-see for the fashionista blog-pack !!
She wore the most amazingly glamorous dress in white, with an embellished bodice, and layers and layers of fine tulle in the skirt - designed by Australian designer Paulo Sebastian, everyone on Twitter went mad for it !! However, calamity struck when the zipper suddenly went AWOL in the middle of her live streaming commentary - what a disaster !! Could happen to anyone, but I suspect that either the dress was slightly too tight, and the zipper came apart, or the zipper was faulty - either way it was embarrassing, but Giuliana handled it with total professional aplomb, laughing it off as they went into the inevitable advert break !!

Never mind - the dress was a triumph anyway - it came in as the 4th most Googled dress from the red carpet of the evening, which is pretty good going !! I also liked her beautiful silver box-clutch.

To perform her song, she changed into another dress, a tulle gown in the palest peach colour with creamy lace overlaid on top - this was designed by Reem Acra, from her Resort 2013 Collection - I said she was having a great night, didn&#39;t I !!&nbsp; Idina looked fabulous in both dresses, so she gets a gold star too...

Here&#39;s Jenna in the <i>third</i> Reem Acra dress in my Best Dressed list - this one was also from the Resort 2013 Collection, coincidentally - a popular collections that one !! This one is similar in feel - it is a pale frothy design with layers of tulle showing at the bottom and much embellishment on the top. Lovely textures in this dress with beading all over the top half and frothy layers of tulle leading into a train at the bottom - beautiful stuff and a typical red carpet dress from Reem Acra actually...

I love Jenna&#39;s amazing chandelier earrings - they are fabulous !! They compliment the dress perfectly, and show up nicely against her dark hair. Fairly natural but well-defined make-up gave her a great red carpet look !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JENNIFER LAWRENCE</span></b>
Jennifer chose this beautiful bright red dress - one of only a mere handful of really brightly coloured dresses on the red carpet last night - this was designed by Raf Simons for Christian Dior, not surprising that she chose a Dior gown seeing as she is the official face of the brand, and has been since October 2012 !! She looked lovely in this column dress, with demi-peplums on the hips to accentuate curves, and an absolutely flawless fit.

As for styling, she chose this pretty diamond necklace to wear backwards for interesting back detail, and tiny matching earrings. Her hair was cut into a really chic, short, swept back style with highlights and lowlights to give it texture, and her make-up was fresh-faced and young - a fab look all round !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JESSICA BIEL</span></b>
Jessica shone in this shimmery pastel peachy-nude gown designed by Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel&#39;s Spring 2014 Couture Collection. I liked this when it went down the runway and selected it for red carpet stardom, and so it has proved !! She kept everything else simple, with her hair loose over one shoulder and the simplest of fresh-faced make-up. A small selection of beautiful jewels from Tiffany &amp; Co&#39;s Blue Book Collection complimented the dress beautifully, including a matching bracelet and earring set and a fabulous contemporary diamond necklace.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KATE HUDSON</span></b>
Kate really wowed me with this amazing dress-with-cape ensemble, which came from the Atelier Versace Spring 2014 Couture Collection. Sadly, it wasn&#39;t one that I chose when I looked at this collection, but I wish I had - it&#39;s really lovely !! The shimmery white fabric is gorgeous and the cape detail combined with the sheath-like swathe of fabric round the hips is quite unusual - this is one <i>beautiful</i> dress !!

Embellished with crystal beading all over, the cape is a detachable extra which really lends a touch of old Hollywood glamour to an already gorgeous dress. Kate took the cape off later in the evening when she left, and also gave us a close look at he enormous cocktail ring on her finger !!

Here is another pastel coloured gown - this one in the palest rose-blush, designed by Roberto Cavalli - that master of the understatement !! This is an exceptionally quiet design for him, I must say...and exceptionally beautiful too !! A strapless back-laced corset bodice covered in lace, and a full fishtail skirt in fine layers of delicate tulle - yes, typical Cavalli, but the pale colour converts it from a possible tarty nightmare into a dreamy and romantic gown, and a perfect wedding dress...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LADY GAGA</span></b>
La Gaga presented herself in a positively <i>conventional</i> manner for a change - however, she still looked a gazillion dollars in this amazing Atelier Versace gown fron the Spring 2014 Collection. This is the <i>second</i> Versace couture creation I missed out on when I picked for the red carpet - what a gaffe !! Still, I was trying to keep it to a minimum for that Couture post, as I was doing all the designers together instead of a separate post each, and the Atelier Versace collection is always a red carpet-focused collection, so - hey-ho !!
Lady Gaga is the current face of Versace, and she looked utterly fabulous in this pale pinky-lilac corseted gown with raised ribs of silver satin stitch and a matching fly-away voile scarf slung over both shoulders - how utterly <i>Italiano !!</i> This is definitely classic Milan-style. She went with her hair up and flawless make-up, and proved that she can still take the red carpet by storm even when she plays it totally straight...

Lupita has had a fantastic red carpet season - and no wonder, when she has won awards for her role in &#39;<i>Twelve Years a Slave&#39;</i> right left from centre !! She of course, won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and looked the part in this amazing pale blue pleated chiffon gown designed by Prada especially for her !! The dress featured glittery beading all down the skirt to catch the sunlight on the red carpet, and heavier beading round the hem to weight it down a bit - nevertheless, she still played with it, twirling it round her on the red carpet - well, you would, wouldn&#39;t you ?!!

She can just about get away with such a low-cut front, as she is quite small-busted - no embarrassing fashion gaffes here !! She kept her make-up down to practically just lipstick, and wore a pair of diamond ear-cuffs to compliment her side-shorn hair with silver hair-band - a very fresh take and a very contemporary look for such a gorgeous gown !!

Maria went with an Australian designer, Johanna Johnson for her red carpet moment - this wonderful white crystal-beaded dress looked perfect with her plexi-glass clutch, diamond ear-cuffs (quite a popular option at the Oscars this year) and huge black agate cocktail ring. She had her hair styled into a coiled plait-bun slung low like a chignon - a very pretty style and very romantic, I think anyway !! The dress had a very low-cut back which set off the high slash-neck at the front beautifully...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">NANCY O&#39;DELL</span></b>
Nancy is the anchorwoman for the syndicated TV show &#39;<i>Entertainment Tonight</i>&#39;, and in that capacity she interviews stars on the red carpet for the viewers at home !! As such, she needs to look every bit as glamorous as the stars she is interviewing, and she gets it right more often than not - she is a bit of a fixture in my Best Dressed lists, so it&#39;s not a surprise she is here again !! She is wearing a beautiful gown from Mac Duggal, a California-based designer specialising in red carpet and couture evening-wear, and very popular amongst red carpet stars like Nancy who need the dress for their work.
She looks fabulous in this - and apparently she had a choice of three which she threw open to comments on Twitter, and let the fans decide - they chose this one and I have to agree, it was the best of the bunch !! Encrusted with square silver sequins, this one glittered and shimmered, reflected the red carpet below, and fitted her like a glove !!

She chose huge filigree drop earrings which were stunning - Nancy often wears this type of thing, and a matching cuff bracelet by the looks of it. She looks absolutely fabulous in this ensemble and so she gets a gold star from me.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">PENELOPE CRUZ</span></b>
Penelope went with a Giambattista Valli Couture custom-made gown, and I&#39;m just going to detour here a bit to clarify what that means:-
If it is custom designed for her, it is therefore unique - you wouldn&#39;t be able to buy this gown, even in a couture capacity - it&#39;s not part of their Couture Collection, and that&#39;s what custom-designed actually means !! All custom gowns are by definition couture items, but not all couture gowns are custom-<i>designed</i>. They are made-to-measure, but are still from a collection, so other women could wear the same dress. Clear as mud?...
I thought Penelope looked wonderful in this lovely design - a Grecian-style gown with a one-shoulder scarf detail which draped over her other arm like a shawl, and the palest of pinks combined with black ribbon-sash and clutch made this a memorable outfit indeed - the pale pink colour really suits her Mediterranean colouring and her dark hair, and she chose diamond waterfall earrings by Chopard to finish it all off - and she looked fabulous !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">PORTIA DE ROSSI</span></b>
The long-term partner of Oscars host Ellen de Generes, Portia chose this amazing Naeem Khan design dress from his Pre-Fall 2014 Collection. I love the laser-cut lace effect and the Islamic star-inspired pattern on the skirt !! She had the front filled in with an extra panel which was probably a wise move, as the runway original had a neckline which plunged down to the waist. The dress went out into a slight train at he back which always looks fab on the red carpet.

She went for some really big jewellery, especially the huge pearl cluster bracelet on her left wrist. I liked her beaded Art Deco clutch too, which was simply <i>dripping</i> with drop crystals and just oozed glamour !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SANDRA BULLOCK</span></b>
Sandra really went for the high octane glamour option, wearing this midnight blue Duchess satin gown with a side panel of finely pleated tulle bursting forth from the thigh-high split - absolutely gorgeous and very classy !! This was from Alexander McQueen, and had a very elegant and sophisticated look about it indeed.

I loved her hair waved into soft ringlety curls over one shoulder, which seems to be the most popular way of styling long hair for this do, and a really beautiful pair of diamond ear-cuffs from Lorraine Schwartz, which I covet enormously !! The ear-cuff style of earrings are immensely popular it seems, with this being the third and best pair featured in this post alone !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SHAUN ROBINSON</span></b>
The &#39;<i>Access Hollywood</i>&#39; correspondent Shaun chose the only other bright red dress for the Oscars red carpet - this one was designed by Romona Kevesa, a designer who is growing in popularity amongst the Hollywood set these days. This dress had an unusual asymmetrical slash neckline, which at least one other fashion critic said was &#39;<i>a bit too 90s for her</i>&#39; - yes, well - whatever...
I liked it and therefore she stays in my Best Dressed list !!

She went for gold earrings that had a slightly primitive but very contemporary look about them. She completed her look with a red Swarovski crystal clutch and a superb white square-cut cocktail ring.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">RED CARPET MATERNITY LOOKS (</span><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HOW TO GET IT RIGHT) </span></b>
As there were no less than<i> three </i>heavily pregnant stars on the Oscars red carpet on Sunday evening, I thought that I&#39;d just say a few words about dressing up for a special event when you are possibly<i> not</i> feeling at your most glamorous.
I get it totally that some women feel absolutely fantastic when they are into their second trimester - the hormones have settled down into pregnancy mode - your hair, nails and skin are looking the best they have ever been, and you are positively glowing !!
However, by the time you are well into your third trimester, and coming up to the final two or three weeks, the glow is beginning to pall and the novelty is most definitely beginning to wear off !! You begin to feel heavy, tired and fed up with all that extra weight -<i> then</i> you get the invitation to attend what is probably the biggest event in the Hollywood social calendar - what is a girl to do ?!!
Take a top tip from two of the stars from Sunday evening and keep it <i>simple</i> - choose plain flattering colours that you know suit you well, and simple Empire-line styles that allow your bump to be supported secretly with some choice underwear - and above all, wear a really great bra - it&#39;ll do wonders for your figure, your confidence and your self-esteem !!
Two of the three star got it so very right on Sunday evening, but sadly, one got it - oh - so wrong !!
Read on...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KERRY WASHINGTON</span></b>
Kerry looked just fabulous in this lilacy-mocha coloured empire-line dress from Jason Wu. The free-flowing shape didn&#39;t restrict her movement in any way and the unusual bust detail took the attention away from her baby bump. I loved this look for her - it was elegant and classy, glamorous and flattering. The draped pleated style stopped her looking like a ship in full sail, which some maternity dresses do...this is a very common danger with full length evening-wear, but this kind of styling solves that problem beautifully !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">OLIVIA WILDE</span></b>
Olivia also got it right with this amazing black Empire-line gown from the Valentino Pre-Fall 2014 Collection, no doubt slightly adapted for her baby-on-board !! It was immensely flattering - slightly fitted under the bust and flowing down over her baby bump beautifully without being too full.
Round the back, there was extra drama with a low-cut keyhole opening under the collar, which formed a bow at the back of the neck. I liked this enormously, particularly the dramatic white inserted panel which flowed out behind her like a train - absolutely stunning !!
A large pair of white statement earrings, a white clutch, and a beautifully executed updo made her look a million dollars - bravo Olivia !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ELSA PATAKY</span></b>
Oh dear - this otherwise beautiful teal blue beaded and sequinned Elie Saab gown just isn&#39;t doing her any favours whatsoever !! The only thing wrong with this is the fact that there is a seam under her bump, which makes her look absolutely vast - I mean, it&#39;s disastrous !! She looks like she&#39;s concealing a huge watermelon under there !!
Maternity dresses should be above all else comfortable - and this just doesn&#39;t look comfortable at all. It probably is but it doesn&#39;t<i> look</i> it...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">THE WORST DRESSED LIST !!</span></b>
These days my Worst Dressed lists are getting shorter and shorter - is it because stars are getting more and more red carpet-savvy, or is it because if the rise and rise of the fashion blogger ensuring that they keep their stylists on their toes ? Who knows the real reason, but I think it&#39;s a combination of the two things - the second leading to the first.
Anyhow, I only have four stars who really got it wrong in my book...it was five until I decided to take Elsa away and put her into my Maternity bit...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CATHERINE MARTIN</span></b>
Catherine got not one, but two Oscars, for Best Costume Design and Best Production for her ravishing work for &#39;<i>The Great Gatsby</i>&#39; directed by her husband, Baz Luhrmann. I watched this film on the plane going to Canada last week, and I was totally entranced by both the costumes and the sets, so I am pleased that both of these received the Oscar Awards !! She looked as pleased as Punch to get two, of course...
For her big evening, she picked this peachy-coloured dress with an enormous black floral print, and embellished with glitzy beading at the shoulders and all down the sides. I was totally not on board with this dress simply because of all the extra details that weren&#39;t needed:-
I didn&#39;t need the extra crystals and I certainly didn&#39;t need that huge purple glittery necklace !! I also didn&#39;t need that bleached blonde hair or that bright red lipstick - why not match the colour of the dress with a dark peachy lip gloss perhaps ? Much more subtle and refined.
As it is she looks big, bold and brassy, hair and everything else, which is a shame because the custom-designed Prada dress is actually quite beautiful. Take away the necklace, the red lipstick, and the bleached blonde hair and the dress really shines. At the moment it&#39;s somewhat overpowered by everything else !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JULIA ROBERTS</span></b>
Sadly, Julia has had a horrendous few months, what with the recent suicide of her half-sister, involving a note blaming Julia for her depression, and the recent revelations that her mother is now battling lung cancer. Amazingly, Julia decided to attend the Oscars on Sunday evening, mainly because she was nominated for her role in &#39;<i>August: Osage County</i>&#39; for the Best Supporting Actress Award. Kudos to her then for attending in the circumstances. Given all that, I think she can be forgiven for not looking as amazingly star-like as she would normally be.
She is usually referred to as Hollywood Royalty, but I didn&#39;t think she looked anything like Hollywood royalty on Sunday evening - her black lace Givenchy Couture dress was just a little boring. Unflattering and dowdy, it really didn&#39;t do a lot for her really.
Her hair looked a little strange too, sideswept but not quite right really - it looked like it might drift down at any second, and was in an unflattering bun at he back. I did like her diamond earrings, but on the whole, I thought she could do so much better !!
Hopefully, when she can put all this recent stuff behind her, she will regain some of her red carpet mojo...

Oh dear - Whoopi seems to have fallen foul of the white shirt / black strapless gown fad that I absolutely hate - I mean, who on earth thought that this was a really great idea !!? It&#39;s a disaster...
Loads of extra-to-requirements jewellery going on here too - the long strand of flapper-necklace pearls look really naff on such a big bosom, because they<i> always</i> hang to the left or the right - they desperately need a flat chest to hang straight and don&#39;t let anyone persuade you otherwise !! I am not really liking the huge jointed knuckle-duster rings either - contemporary or not, they seem a tad inappropriate in here.

Unbelievably, Whoopi decided to show off her high red shoes on-stage, also revealing her black and white stripy socks - WTF ?!! I&#39;ve no doubt she was joking about having her red shoes on, but they really weren&#39;t a good look !!

Well, the Oscars ceremony threw up a good deal of fantastic red carpet WTF moments - from Giuliana Rancic busting out of her zipper on live TV, Jennifer Lawrence taking a fall a<i>gain</i>, Benedict Cumberbatch photo-bombing several other stars during their photo-op, and a few other things too...

Next up will be my look at the Oscar Party fashions - the best of the other Hollywood stars, the ones who didn&#39;t get invited to the actual ceremony, and what they wore to the two biggest parties in town. See you soon !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">MY TOP TEN BEST DRESSED STARS</span></b> <b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">!!</span></b>
The BAFTAs were held at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden this year - a fitting and gorgeous venue, - followed by the inevitable after-party at Grosvenor House. This was a smaller affair than the big events over in La-la-land, but it&#39;s a very<i> British</i> affair nonetheless !! I have chosen my own personal Top 10 Best Dressed stars - see what you think?!!

<lj-cut>


<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">AMY ADAMS</span></b>
Amy rarely disappoints at these events, and this was no exception - a beautiful little black dress that relied on its fine detailing rather than any kind of statement silhouette, or over-the-top styling. This is a Victoria Beckham creation, featuring a sheer sectioned bodice and a column shape. As with most LBDs, it wasn&#39;t so much <i>what</i> she wore, but <i>how</i> she wore it !! Vampy blood-red lipstick, black nails, tiny diamond earrings and a side-swept bun all contributed towards her amazing look !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CATE BLANCHETT</span></b>
Cate is another star who rarely disappoints on the red carpet - she has such amazing style due not only to her fashion choices, but also to the calm grace with which she deports herself at all these red carpet events - she never seems to get fazed by anything, and it would take a truly hideous dress to make me give her a thumbs down (oh, it has happened !!)
Anyway, here she chose a stunning gown in black anmd silver, designed by Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen, from the Pre-fall 2014 Collection. She went with an amazing huge silver pendant by Chopard to set it off - truly a statement piece !!
She kept her make-up very natural and understated, and her hair simple and elegant without being too dressy - I liked this look enormously - vaguely Chinesey, and so very Cate !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">FEARNE COTTON</span></b>
Fearne is a popular radio presenter here in the UK, which is why you might not have heard of her in the US. She went all out for glitz and golden old Hollywood glamour in this gold beaded gown from the archives of William Vintage - one of no less than <i>three</i> gowns from his establishment seen at&nbsp; the BAFTAs this year !! This one was designed by Scaasi back in 1980, and here Fearne looks amazing in it, with her hair styled in a real Marilyn Monroe bob with dramatic curls, natural make-up and vampy burgundy nails - simply fabulous !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">GEORGINA CHAPMAN</span></b>
Georgina chose one of her own designs of course - the Marchesa designer looked gorgeous in it too - this was from her Autumn 2013 RTW Collection, and a bit of a winner it is too !! It&#39;s one I picked out this time last year and this is the first time it&#39;sbeen seen to the best of my knowledge - I may be wrong. She styled it very simply, letting the dress do the talking, with her hair down loose, but pinned at the back so it was off her face, well-defined but not too heavy make-up, tiny diamond earrings and a simple gold clutch - beautiful !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HELEN MIRREN</span></b>
Dame Helen was up for the Outstanding Contribution Award, which is the BAFTAs equivalent of the Oscars Lifetime Achievement Award really - and I can&#39;t think of any other British actress who hasn&#39;t already received this, who deserves it more !! She also never lets us down on the red carpet either - here she chose a darkest midnight blue Jacques Azagury design, aforned with sparkly sequins and beading, with a delightful light and ruffly cascading tulle skirt. With a bodice right up to the neck and full length sleeves in sheer fabric, she was bang on the red carpet trend, if there is such a thing .

She swept her hair up in a loose chignon so that we could see the simply spectacular earrings she was wearing - star-bursts of diamonds, courtesy of Asprey London, so we know they&#39;re the real thing !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">IMOGEN POOTS</span></b>

Imogen Poots looked smashing in this amazing deep red jersey dress from the Givenchy Spring 2014 Collection - this was done in a stripy fabric on the runway, which obscured the interesting cut a bit - here, you can really see the design, which is better I think.
Usually I find this kind of cut-out design a tad tarty, but she definitely pulls this off. I think the trick is to get the dress from a really big name designer, so that the fabrics are going to be the best possible and the cut is going to be absolutely spot-on. Also, it helps more than anything else how you style it and also, how busty you are, not putting too fine a point on it - can you imagine this on someone who wasn&#39;t so petite ? If you wear this kind of design, you need to be a really slim build with a well-toned flat tummy, all of which describes Imogen perfectly !! After all, there&#39;s no room for any kind of bra in here is there...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JOELY RICHARDSON</span></b>
Not everyone liked this amazing dress, but I spotted an unusual vintage design straight away - this is the second dress of the evening from William Vintage&#39;s fine hire establishment, dating from 1978. and designed by Bob Mackie - wow, that&#39;s really going back a bit !! A name I haven&#39;t heard for years...
It&#39;s eye-catching as only dresses from that period can be, and it&#39;s unlike anything anyone else was wearing, so kudos to Joely for choosing it !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JUDI DENCH</span></b>
Dame Judi often does her own thing on the red carpet - she wears Indo-Chinese style coats and matching trousers quite often, with floaty scarves and great jewellery. Not for her the conventional red carpet gown - it&#39;s trousers all the way, and I admire her immensely for this, and think that there are a good few older actresses who could take a leaf out if her own particular style-book !! With her gamine spiky crop, and her cheeky grin, she does the red carpet like no-one else in my view...
This outfit is a full length velvet coat with a bright turquoise lining to match her scarf, worn with black trousers and top - and wonderfully relaxed she looked too !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LUPITA NYONG&#39;O</span></b>
The new star of the red carpet didn&#39;t let us down tonight - she went with this beautiful emerald green gown designed by Raf Simons for the Christian Dior Autumn 2013 Couture Collection - isn&#39;t it fabulous ?!! I love this mainly for the amazing shape of the skirt - it&#39;s not exactly a train, but it&#39;s flaring out dramatically around her to one side, and thge fact that it&#39;s a strapless affair shows off her shoulders and neck beautifully. She kept her jewellery to a minimum, and her make-up to the max !!&nbsp; I also liked her big brass cuffs very much, and assume they match the brass belt on her dress.
Bravo Lupita...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SARI MERCER</span></b>
Sari accompanied her boyfriend Chiwetel Ejiofor, as he won the award for Best Leading Actor, and looked stunning in this amazing Maria Grachvogel dress printed with ghostly black and white images if trees. This was from her Autumn 2013 collection shown in London fashion week last February. The collection featured several dresses like this with motifs meant to suggest falling leaves and, according to the designer, the ubiquity of death in nature. Grachvogel is known for prints, and over the last twenty years in the fashion industry has really cornered a niche market for this kind of look. She is now getting very popular with the red carpet crowd looking for something else in their red carpet look, and Sari really proves that this kind of thing can really look fabulous !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">UMA THURMAN</span></b>
<span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">We haven&#39;t seen Uma for a few years, but now she is back with a vengeance this season - she really wowed everyone at the event, not only with her figure-hugging strapless gown designed by Donnatella Versace for the Atelier Versace label, but also for the amazing waistcoat-fronted tail-coat she donned afterwards for the after-party photo-opportunity - this truly was a case of doing her own thing - the androgynous effect was simply stunning !!
With her hair done up in a coiled bun pinned at the back, and her beautiful crystal necklace as a really simple piece of statement jewellery, she looked fabulous...</span>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">THE WORST DRESSED !!</span></b>

I should at least qualify this little category as really being the ones that simply didn&#39;t work for me, although they worked for other fashion talking-heads
&nbsp;on the Internet - many people for instance simply <i>drooled -</i> there&#39;s no other word for it<i> - </i>over this:-

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ANGELINA JOLIE</span></b>
I couldn&#39;t understand why everyone went so doolally over Angelina&#39;s casual &#39;<i>don&#39;t-really-care&#39;</i> outfit - sure, it&#39;s as sexy as Hell in all its androgynous glory, but basically it looked like she didn&#39;t really rate the BAFTAs as being half as important as other major awards events in Hollywood that she <i>would</i> dress up to the nines for...

<img alt=""Angelina Jolie 01"" height=""594"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/816311/816311_original.jpg"" title=""Angelina Jolie 01"" width=""431"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Angelina Jolie 02"" height=""594"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/816618/816618_original.jpg"" title=""Angelina Jolie 02"" width=""395"" />
So what do you all think ? Was she showing that she didn&#39;t rate the BAFTAs as being important, or was she ground-breaking in her casual look ? Be honest now...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">GILLIAN ANDERSON</span></b>
Gillian went for the aforementioned third and final vintage dress from Willam Vintage, with this gown designed by Balmain himself, back in 1949, believe it or not !! It&#39;s a great gown, but it does look a little too stiffly boned and corsetted for comfort !! Gillian looks a tad too upright in it to be truly comfortable, so we go from one extreme to the other, with Angelina Jolie being to casual and Gillian being too straight-laced !!
I kinda wished she had done something better with her hair too...

<img alt=""Gillian Anderson 01"" height=""594"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/816810/816810_original.jpg"" title=""Gillian Anderson 01"" width=""386"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Gillian Anderson 02"" height=""594"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/816994/816994_original.jpg"" title=""Gillian Anderson 02"" width=""410"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LILY ALLEN</span></b>
Here&#39;s another dress that everyone went wild for, and so did I at first - the sheer explosion of brillant colour should make this a definite winner in my book. However, the actual cut of the dress looks messy to me, with the rolled effect of the bodice edging, and the huge skirt that has been pinned up in so many places to give it a uneven billowing look. This is a fairly typical design from Dame Viv, so we shouldn&#39;t be surprised that everyone went wild over it, but actually, it didn&#39;t do much for me !!
I did rather like her amazing ring though - it covered most of her finger...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MAGGIE GYLENHAAL</span></b>
Oh dear - Maggie here often ends up in my Worst Dressed list - and by rights she really shouldn&#39;t, as she has her own very strong sense of style - it&#39;s just that she often chooses things that are over-embellished like this, which overwhelm her generally elfin look. This dress was from Lanvin - a custom-made creation, but I wish it had about three-quarters of those huge pearls taken away, leaving what could be quite a nice dress !!

The BAFTAs are the last big event before the biggest of the season - namely the Oscars on the 2nd of March, which is next weekend !! Luckily, I have a week off in order to cover it, and to do some runway coverage too !!

So do stick around for that...

We have been to Krakow before back in 2005, when another of our Polish friends, Iwona, got married to one of our equally numerous English friends, Paul. The post for that occasion is here :-</p><p><a href=""http://wendysrandomscribblings.wordpress.com/2005/09/08/fun-in-poland-part-3/"">http://wendysrandomscribblings.wordpress.c<wbr />om/2005/09/08/fun-in-poland-part-3/</a></p>You may want to read that one in conjunction with this one, as I may refer back to it. Mainly because we revisited some places and got to see how other places have developed since then !!

Marzenka and her husband Simon got married here in Krakow just over two years ago, and now they have a young son, William, and they felt like revisiting the city of their marriage and having some friends along to celebrate it with. We had a marvellous weekend, with much eating, drinking, playing of games and fun &ndash; we had three very young children with us which made for a very different holiday indeed &ndash; for us anyway !!

This post has been written in my new WordPress blog, but I didn&#39;t want any of my Live Journal friends to miss it, even though it will take you half an hour to read it !!

It has become more and more obvious to me that Live Journal is going East - this blogging platform is now owned by Russian company<i> SUP Media</i>, as you all know, and has been for some considerable time - a while ago, this didn&#39;t matter much of course, and you may not think it matters much now, but it has come to my attention that certain things are no longer updated for the English-speaking customers as fast as the Russian ones, and frankly, there are so many bugs to be fixed that it is becoming a bit of a joke. All the Design &amp; Development is now done from the Russian office, and thus, there are many things that get updated without us getting to know about them until much later. The redesign of our personal Home pages leaves a lot to be desired, with the extinction for English users only of the Live Journal Spotlight ( Russian users have something similar where you can promote and/or recommend posts and journals for others to read)

Not to mention the <i>disgraceful </i>amount of DOS attacks, and down-time simply because some hackers are objecting to certain Russian politicians having a blog - well, how dare they !!

Finally, the fact that there are more and more Russian users has now finally tipped the balance in favour of an F-list consisting of people who happily read my fashion journal, and maybe my personal journal, but with whom I cannot communicate in any meaningful way any more - I have lost count of the times I have had a pingback notification that someone over in Russia has mentioned one of my posts in their journal !! Whilst this pleases me no end of course, I do not speak Russian, and certainly do not intend to learn it just so that I can understand posts written by random people who have befriended my Fashion Journal, which is the most visible journal I have in here.
Meanwhile, more importantly, more and more of my original English-speaking F-list has already decamped, or is in the process of decamping, to more instant social media sites like <i>Facebook </i>and <i>Twitter</i> (that site for those with the attention-span of a gnat !!) I get really tired of reading friend&#39;s posts that are merely C &amp; P lists of their recent Tweets !!

With all that in mind, I have made the monumental decision to decamp myself !! After much research and testing, I have settled on <i>WordPress</i> as a suitably grown-up blogging platform, which is a bit of a revelation actually&nbsp; - for one thing, it has themes where you can wrap text around photos, or choose to have a Search button on your front page. Other functions such as the Like and Share buttons, rather like Facebook, are options that LJ may never get. I also like the fact that you can have as many blogs as you like, all linked by your one user-name, and the fact that you can invite contributors to write posts for you sometimes - useful for my Fashion Journal.

So come on over and see my new <i>WordPress</i> Journals - they don&#39;t look that different from the Live Journal ones - I have tried to make them as similar as possible, to make myself feel at home as much as anyone else !!
These are the two new journals here - please don&#39;t hesitate to befriend them or save the links in your bookmarks list so you can read my updates:-

<a href=""http://fashionpolicefiles.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://fashionpolicefiles.wordpress.com/</a>

<a href=""http://wendysrandomscribblings.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://wendysrandomscribblings.wordpress.com/</a>

I have also been trading in second-hand vintage jewellery on E-bay and E-bid as you all know, so I have decided to create a new jewellery blog too - here:-

<a href=""http://vintagejewelleryfun.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://vintagejewelleryfun.wordpress.com/</a>

Please come and have your say about this important decision and get any concerns or queries off your chest - I will be reposting this on my other journal too, so you might have two notifications on your Friend&#39;s page !! If you like what you see - you may consider following me over there, especially if you have become a bit frustrated that Live Journal has become far too quiet of late, with everyone leaving in droves. It did prove amazingly easy to transfer each journal <i>in their entirety</i>, into their new homes - yes, all my posts right back to 2005 !!

Also, come and see my new jewellery blog and have a look at some of my current items for sale if you fancy a bit of a change from the usual stuff in the shops...

Like me, you are probably reviewing what you may, or may not have achieved during the year, and are currently making some New Year&#39;s Resolutions ? Funny thing, resolutions - they have a habit of coming back to haunt you at the end of the year, particularly if you didn&#39;t quite achieve what you set out to achieve in January 2013. Are you looking back ruefully and making resolutions that appear to be identical to the last lot ?!! Well, cheer up - for I have created some truly amazing Fashion Resolutions that are both astoundingly easy to keep, <i>and</i> as a result you will look ten times better, and possibly a bit slimmer too - without even dieting !!

<lj-cut text=""WENDY'S NEW YEAR FASHION RESOLUTIONS..."">

<span style=""color:#000000;""><b><span style=""font-size: 1.8em;"">MY OWN PERSONAL FASHION PET HATES - RULES FOR WHAT NOT TO WEAR !!</span></b></span>
During my forays around the wonderful world-wide web, searching for examples of what I consider to be the worst examples of what not to wear, I came across this fantastically awful selection of surreptitious pics taken of certain customers shopping in branches of the US chain, Walmart - the original, and the best of the <i>&#39;Pile &#39;em high, sell &#39;em cheap</i>&#39; school of retailing !!
Now, it would be unfair indeed, to say that America is the only place where people are photographed in the most amazingly hideous outfits, but Walmart does seems to attract the strangest people...
Therefore, with a little help from the good customers of Walmart, and a few other bits and pieces from around the Internet, I give you my New Year Fashion Resolutions for 2014 - read on and select from my own personal list, or indeed, make your own up and list them in my comments column below...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">1. WEARING THE WRONG SIZE</span></b>
<span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">The worst fashion crime of all in my view, is not being honest with yourself about what size you are. Wearing the wrong size can result in some of the worst fashion faux-pas possible, and it&#39;s true to say that a lot of people are not actually aware of what size they really need. Being a bit overweight doesn&#39;t mean you should let everything slide, because you<i> could</i> end up looking like a right slob - right? It&#39;s a slippery slope indeed.</span>
Three-quarters of the most common &#39;crimes against fashion&#39; committed by women and two-thirds of the outfit offences committed by men, result not from poor design but from misjudged size choices, resulting in poor fit, a survey from <a href=""http://fits.me/"" target=""_blank"">Fits.me</a> suggests.
<p><strong><img alt="""" height=""434"" src=""http://www.retailtechnologyreview.com/assets/files/images/14_08_13/muffin-top_38910139.jpg"" width=""650"" /></strong></p><p>Forty per cent of women admit to having endured a VPL (visible panty-line) &ndash; making this the most common fashion faux pas &ndash; followed by displaying a &#39;muffin top&#39; (33%) and showing too much cleavage (32%). It&#39;s not just women either - a quarter of men under 35 have fallen victim to wearing their trousers too high and over a fifth of men admit to wearing garments with inadequate sleeve lengths.</p><p>As I said, it&#39;s not just in America either - Britons abroad are well known for their taste transgressions, and it seems our reputation is well-earned: one in 10 women have worn bikinis that are too small, while a third of women admit to wearing skirts that are too short.&nbsp; This summer&#39;s trend of denim shorts is only adding to the problem: a quarter of 18-24 year-olds admit to wearing shorts that don&#39;t cover their derri&egrave;re.</p><p>The most common fashion-crimes across both countries that are the fault of badly fitting clothing choices include:</p><ul>
<li>VPL: 48 % of women</li>

<li>Muffin tops: 39% of women</li>

<li>Too much cleavage on show: 44% of women</li>

<li>Skirts that are way too short: 41% of women</li>

<li>Bikinis that are far too small: 12% of women</li>

<li>Shorts that don&#39;t cover your bum: 7% of women</li>

<li>Ankle-swinging trousers: 23% of women and 15% of men</li>

</ul><span style=""font-size:1.0em;"">So, without further ado, here&#39;s a small selection of people who are getting it wrong on so many levels, just to illustrate my point:-</span>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">1a. LETTING IT ALL HANG OUT</span></b>
Buy tops that cover your stomach all the way down, and trousers that fit nicely round the waist - exposing your belly should really be confined to the likes of Lady Gaga and Rihanna, who work out in the gym every day - they work really hard at looking good, as part of their profession, and they have the most amazingly toned bodies as a result.
So, if you&#39;re not prepared to put in some work, don&#39;t bother with that cropped top and dropped-waist trousers !! Here are a couple of extreme examples - well, they&#39;re all extreme examples in this post, but you get my point.:-

<img alt=""Belly 01"" height=""375"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/322463/322463_original.jpg"" title=""Belly 01"" width=""600"" />

<img alt=""Belly 02"" height=""404"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/322742/322742_original.jpg"" title=""Belly 02"" width=""644"" />
<i>I mean, seriously - have some decorum !!</i>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">1b. MUFFIN-TOPS</span></b>
This is the famous &#39;muffin-top&#39;, where the rolls of fat spill out over your waistband - one of the worst fashion misdemeanours in my view. It creates rolls of fat that are really not a good look at all.Buying a size or two bigger will go some wy to preventing this.

<img alt=""Muffin-top 01"" height=""360"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/324804/324804_original.jpg"" title=""Muffin-top 01"" width=""240"" />

<img alt=""Muffin Back 01"" height=""375"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/335573/335573_original.jpg"" title=""Muffin Back 01"" width=""600"" />
<i>Muffin-tops can refer to backs of dresses too...this lady is also committing another fashion crime which I will mention further down - can you guess what it is ?</i>

<span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><b>1c.WEARING THE WRONG SIZE ALTOGETHER</b></span>
If you like your jeans skin-tight and with that dropped waist look - please, please,<i> please</i>, at least make sure you are wearing the <i>correct size !!...</i>

<img alt=""Wrong size 01"" height=""404"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/334934/334934_original.jpg"" title=""Wrong size 01"" width=""644"" />

<img alt=""Droopy-drawers 01"" height=""387"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/323920/323920_original.jpg"" title=""Droopy-drawers 01"" width=""620"" />

<img alt=""Wrong size 02"" height=""404"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/335271/335271_original.jpg"" title=""Wrong size 02"" width=""644"" />

<img alt=""VPL 01"" height=""259"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/334797/334797_original.jpg"" title=""VPL 01"" width=""194"" />
Even if you wear higher-waisted trousers, if they&#39;re too tight, the VPL is ever ready to trip you up.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">1d. NO SUPPORT WHATSOEVER</span></b>
Of all the possible permutations on the wrong size theme, there is truly nothing worse than wearing the wrong-sized bra, or perhaps no bra at all when you really need support. Take my advice and get yourself measured for that new bra properly, by a trained fitter, and see the amazing difference - you&#39;ll look as if you&#39;ve lost about fourteen pounds in weight immediately and you&#39;ll also feel incredibly comfortable - I promise !!

<img alt=""No support 01"" height=""375"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/325016/325016_original.jpg"" title=""No support 01"" width=""600"" />
<img alt=""No support 02"" height=""800"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/325200/325200_original.jpg"" title=""No support 02"" width=""600"" />
<i>It really isn&#39;t a good look is it ?!!</i>

So, wearing the right size is just a matter of getting the correct fit in the end. Don&#39;t get too hung up on numbers either- it&#39;s a proven fact that one company&#39;s size 16 is another company&#39;s size 18 or even 20, so what does it matter what the number actually is ? Make sure it fits well and see the difference !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">2. KEEPING IT CLEAN</span></b>
The next worst fashion crime is being less than well-groomed when it comes to personal cleanliness, and I most definitely include keeping your clothes clean and ironed within that broad category.
Here&#39;s what it really looks like when you go shopping and can&#39;t be bothered to change out of your gardening clothes:-

<img alt=""Dirty 01"" height=""375"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/323013/323013_original.jpg"" title=""Dirty 01"" width=""600"" />

And don&#39;t even think of going down this route - skid-marks and unmentionable stains are simply not an option, for anyone - <i>ever !!:</i>-

<img alt=""Dirty 02"" height=""404"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/323271/323271_original.jpg"" title=""Dirty 02"" width=""644"" />

<i>I mean, seriously - WTF ?!!</i>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">3. AREN&#39;T YOU FORGETTING SOMETHING ?</span></b>
There has been a big trend recently, particularly in the world of female singers and stage performers of wearing tops without bottoms and stage outfits based on what used to be called work-out wear - leotards, leggings and swimsuits etc, etc. However, the knock-on effect of this appears to be that ordinary people in the street, or in this case, in the supermarket, have taken to this trend in an alarmingly enthusiastic way, whether or not it actually suits their physique - and it usually does not !!

<img alt=""No trousers 01"" height=""375"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/325388/325388_original.jpg"" title=""No trousers 01"" width=""600"" />
<i>At least there are no muffin-tops on show as well...</i>

<img alt=""No trousers 02"" height=""375"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/325773/325773_original.jpg"" title=""No trousers 02"" width=""600"" />
<i>Rather freaky leggings with a flayed human muscle-system print - totally scary !!</i>

Someone, somewhere, thought it would actually be a great idea to produce leggings in a pale creamy-beige flesh colour<i> -</i> what a klutz !! But not only that, these women though<i>t</i> it would be a great idea to actually buy them and <i>wear </i>them while out shopping !!

<img alt=""No trousers 03"" height=""404"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/326122/326122_original.jpg"" title=""No trousers 03"" width=""644"" />

<img alt=""No trousers 05"" height=""375"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/326453/326453_original.jpg"" title=""No trousers 05"" width=""600"" />
<i>No - just no...</i>

<img alt=""No trousers 04"" height=""375"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/326151/326151_original.jpg"" title=""No trousers 04"" width=""600"" />
Lacy tights and fishnet stockings without any accompanying skirt or shorts could arguably be acceptable wear as a costume for the Rocky Horror Show audience perhaps, but not while you&#39;re out shopping - surely !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">4. MATCHY-MATCHY</span></b>
If there&#39;s one thing I really hate to see, it&#39;s couples who wear the same outfits - it&#39;s not cute and it&#39;s definitely not sexy - in any way whatsoever !!

<img alt=""Double trouble 01"" height=""375"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/323792/323792_original.jpg"" title=""Double trouble 01"" width=""600"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">5. ONESIE</span></b>
This is truly the one garment that will take you from cradle to grave - this is essentially an adult-sized baby-gro - please don&#39;t mistake it for a smart outfit to wear to the shops, work or a drink down the pub - because it&#39;s definitely not !!

<img alt=""Onesie 01"" height=""375"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/326736/326736_original.jpg"" title=""Onesie 01"" width=""600"" />

<img alt=""Onesie 02"" height=""369"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/327087/327087_original.jpg"" title=""Onesie 02"" width=""634"" />
<i>See - the whole family can wear them all together for that true cosy family feeling...or maybe not !!</i>

<img alt=""Onesie Double trouble 05"" height=""440"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/327906/327906_original.jpg"" title=""Onesie Double trouble 05"" width=""303"" />
<i>You could even go for the dreaded Matchy-Matchy scenario and kill two birds with one incredibly unfashionable stone...</i>

Here&#39;s how to wear a Onesie...
<img alt=""Onesie 03 Kate Moss"" height=""660"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/327338/327338_original.jpg"" title=""Onesie 03 Kate Moss"" /> &nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Onesie 04 Jennifer Ellison"" height=""666"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/327535/327535_original.jpg"" title=""Onesie 04 Jennifer Ellison"" width=""306"" />
Two ladies who get the Onesie right - Kate Moss looks amazingly smart and Jennifer Ellison manages to look cute in her Scandinavian knitwear style - so thumbs up for these two - if you really like the Onesie trend, consider going for either of these two looks rather than the giant oversize animal-print with accompanying ears and tail...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">6. WEIRD HAIR</span></b>
Ok - these photos are of people with extremely weird hair - if you are sporting an extreme style, give it a good look in the mirror - back and sides as well as front view, and ask yourself whether it <i>really</i> looks really great and flatters you as well as turning a few heads, or does it look a bit - well, weird ?!!

<img alt=""Scary hair 01"" height=""375"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/328155/328155_original.jpg"" title=""Scary hair 01"" width=""600"" />

<i>The overly long and huge hairstyles here are clearly wigs, but why ?</i>

<span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><b>7. VISIBLE UNDERWEAR</b></span>
This is of course, my favourite pet hate - no underwear should be on show - ever. There&#39;s a clue in the name...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">7a. BRAS &amp; BRA-STRAPS ON SHOW</span></b>
This just looks slovenly, I&#39;m afraid and shouldn&#39;t ever be considered to not matter&nbsp; - bra-straps are particularly easy to miss when getting dressed. Invest in the correct bra for the outfit and this won&#39;t ever be a problem again. If you&#39;re wearing a halter-neck or a racing-back tee, then get the appropriate bra or maybe a strapless version.

Of course, some women don&#39;t consider it a problem - bra-straps, what bra-straps ?:-

<img alt=""Visible bra-straps 01"" height=""451"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/332979/332979_original.jpg"" title=""Visible bra-straps 01"" width=""720"" />

Lady Gaga and Miley really go for that underwear on show look...however, that doesn&#39;t give the rest of the population permission to slag it up !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">7b. THONGS ON SHOW</span></b>
The other side of this particularly horrid coin is of course, the ubiquitous thong peeping out from the waistband of your jeans...and part of the solution to this may well be to get correctly fitting jeans in the first place...

<img alt=""Visible thong 01"" height=""375"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/333683/333683_original.jpg"" title=""Visible thong 01"" width=""600"" />

<i>Do we really want to see this vision next to the meat counter ?...Again, it&#39;s not about size, it&#39;s about choosing the right clothing - and grey see-through leggings are definitely not right !!</i>

<i>Yes - indeed !!</i>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">8a. HIDEOUSLY CRAZY SHOES</span></b>
Vow never to wear anything that needs a balancing act just to stay upright !! High heels are all very well, and they do give that special outfit a bit of oomph - but if you require a couple of pals to support you when you&#39;ve had a few too many, or if taking them off in the street at 2am seems a great idea, than it&#39;s safe to say that your heels are probably a bit too adventurous...
Be honest with yourself, and stick with a height that&#39;s truly comfortable - say, a couple of inches max.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">8b. INAPPROPRIATE FOOTWEAR</span></b>
Going hand in hand with crazy footwear is the little problem of <i>inappropriate</i> footwear, and by this I mean specifically, pairing these:-

<img alt=""TRAINERS 01"" height=""300"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady1/7537546/337539/337539_original.jpg"" title=""TRAINERS 01"" width=""300"" />

with this:-

Just don&#39;t !! It&#39;s not a good look as it cuts off your legs and makes you look incredibly<i> dumpy.</i> Bulky footwear like trainers go well with jeans, or indeed, running gear, but that&#39;s pretty much all. I don&#39;t care if they are incredibly comfortable for your early morning commute, and I simply don&#39;t believe that all those women who are guilty of this fashion crime all walk two or three miles to work. If you really do this, and require trainers with your smart work suit, then maybe you should consider changing your job for a post a little nearer home ? Or invest in some amazingly expensive, and heavenly comfortable, soft leather boots instead.
As for other nasty footwear, these horrors below are <i>always</i> inappropriate:-

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">9. FROM ANOTHER PLANET ?</span></b>
There is a whole section of society for whom conventional clothing holds unimaginable horrors - and for me, imaginative outfits can look truly amazing. Lady Gaga is an expert at this. Don&#39;t get me wrong in this, I<i> love</i> a really good unconventional outfit as much as the next Fashionista. However, there is &#39;unconventional&#39; and then there is just plain<i> weird..</i>.

My regular readers from way back will all know that this is a favourite pet hate of mine !! Jeans that are partially destroyed is just not a great look - sorry if you love &#39;em - I do not, and probably never will. Hand in hand with the trend for ripped jeans is the slightly newer trend for torn tights, and it&#39;s equally rubbish - chuck &#39;em in the bin !!

These is what my husband likes to call &#39;<i>Duke of York</i>&#39; jeans - in the words of the old rhyme, they&#39;re &#39;neither up nor down&#39;...I don&#39;t pretend to understand the trend for wearing your jeans so low-slung that they&#39;re in grave danger of actually falling down around your ankles - but I&#39;d be ecstatic if I saw that really happen one day !! I hate this fashion with a passion - I really wish it would go away already.
If you&nbsp; are a bloke who likes this fashion, please just get a reality check - they make your body look incredibly long, and your legs look stupidly short - perhaps a good New Year Fashion Resolution for you would be to try another fashion option instead - wear hip-level jeans that fit properly or maybe take up wearing sharp suits with skinny trousers and pointy shoes - so much more stylish !!
No-one really needs to know that you wear Calvin Klein underwear...

That&#39;s it for my own list of New Year Fashion Resolutions - please feel free to adopt any or all of them - but you probably don&#39;t have to, as I just know that you&#39;re all looking fabulous as you get older and probably a bit fatter, as is inevitable with age !!
With many humble thanks to those unfortunate customers of Walmart who have been captured on camera and plastered all over the Internet - trust me, my little inclusion of your photos here will not make a jot of difference to the fact that you have already been mortified a gazillion times over !! Perhaps pay a little more attention to how bad you look next time you go shopping, and maybe you won&#39;t be humiliated any more..
And don&#39;t assume that this kind of disturbingly awful style is confined to the US - there are entries from the Australian branches of Walmart too !! I am pretty sure we in Britain do our own special kind of awful fashion in the form of the dreadful tartiness that goes on at Aintree every year, which goes hand in hand with drunken bad behaviour, so we don&#39;t get off lightly either !!
With many thanks also to the People of Walmart.com website who get sent dozens of photos taken in various branches of Walmart all over the US - your site is jaw-droppingly funny in an <i>&#39;I can&#39;t quite believe it</i>&#39; kind of way, and stands as a lasting bastion in the name of what is good taste and what is just plain wrong !!

If you enjoyed these photos, visit their site for even more Walmart horror:-

<a href=""http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/"">http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/</a>

I hope you draw inspiration from these New Year Fashions Resolutions, which more or less take the form of what <i>not </i>to do rather than what to start doing, but if you know you&#39;re in any way guilty of any of these, now&#39;s probably a perfect time to stop !!

Happy New Year everyone...

Yes - you&#39;re possibly thinking that this gorgeous enamel butterfly brooch looks&nbsp; a tad familiar ?!! Well, I had one for sale a while ago and now I have another !! In fact, I have two, one of which I am keeping for myself !!
The dealer who sold me this one tells me that it was designed by a company called <i>&#39;West&#39;</i>, who specialised in gold-plated enamelled jewellery like this. They were in business up until the early 90s, and when the company closed their business down, he bought up a lot of their left-over stock, and is now selling it on e-bay as well as in his own shop !!&nbsp; I loved this and rather regretted selling it on the first time around...
See what other items I currently have for sale, not only on e-bay, but also e-bid - another similar auction site where I have devised my own shop, called &#39;<i>Butterfly Bay&#39;..</i>.

Lots of great outfits and I have to say, lots of rather<i> restrained</i> looks from stars who are usually outrageous - you&#39;ll see who I&#39;m talking about as we go through...

<lj-cut>



<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">BEST DRESSED</span></b>
I&#39;ve picked out thirteen really great outfits worn by some of my favourite red carpet stars - people who clearly pick out their own outfits, and maybe have a <i>little</i> help from a stylist, but who all basically know their own minds when it comes to what they want to wear, and who all remain pretty much true to who they are, I feel !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ARIANA GRANDE</span></b>
I don&#39;t know much about Ariana - she&#39;s not familiar to me, but she is clearly very young and presents a very grown-up face to the world when she walks a red carpet. Apparently she is one of the current crop of Nickelodeon stars, and is twenty years old.
It&#39;s lovely to see someone so young wearing something utterly glamorous and yet still completely age appropriate !! This is a beautiful red sequinned fishtail gown from Dolce &amp; Gabbana, which is strapless and figure-hugging, but not too much so. I like the black edging across the top of the bodice and I love, love,<i> love</i> her huge ponytail - this is a bit of a signature with her, but it&#39;s one that I approve of !!
Accessory-wise, she kept it ultra-simple with a plain black Jimmy Choo clutch and pretty little earrings and ring .

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CIARA</span></b>
Ciara appeared in a much more daring dress - designed by J. Mendel from their Spring 2014 Collection, she dared to bare her all in this lacy number with fabulous results !! The secret to dresses like this is the completely discreet lining in all the places you want to keep under wraps, without compromising the revealing nature of the dress.
She sported a fabulous blonde bob which suits her perfectly - she just looks fabulous all round !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">DAISY FUENTES</span></b>
Daisy&nbsp; chose a rather more classic black and white design from Tadashi Shoji, who is becoming a bit of a red carpet favourite with some stars these days !! For me, although this is a beautiful dress, it feels more suitable for a dressy film awards evening rather than a more relaxed music awards night, if you know what I mean? Having said that, she still stays in my Best Dressed list as I like this outfit for its elegance and style, and the easy way she wears it all !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JAIME ALEXANDER</span></b>
Not everyone liked this look from Jaime, but I did !! I loved the vintage black sequinned top from Giorgio Armani teamed with black trousers - and it&#39;s still good to see trousers being worn on a red carpet. I love her hair up in this high updo with a short fringe, which is new apparently - it shows off her features beautifully - and I also love her huge cocktail ring. She gets a gold star for this great look !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JORDIN SPARKES</span></b>
Jordin went for a black dress featuring lots and lots of gold studs everywhere, designed by Jovani Couture, which again, not everyone liked - however, I think it&#39;s great for an occasion like this - it&#39;s young, edgy and above all, dressy enough for a red carpet without being too over the top !! I like the fact that she went for a not too made up look - just a bit of eye shadow and mascara, and a&nbsp; very natural look everywhere else.
Black and gold bangles and an 80s style ear-cuff (a style that I haven&#39;t seen for ages) completed her look !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KATY PERRY</span></b>
Katy gave us a pair of amazing looks at this event - first of all, she turned up in this gauzy black spotty gown with sprigs of flowers all over the skirt. Designed by Oscar de la Renta, this amazing dress really wowed us all. She did her own thing with her choice of quirky accessories too, with this Olympia Le-Tan &lsquo;<i>Webster&rsquo;s New World Dictionary</i>&rsquo; box clutch. With her hair down, a huge flower cocktail ring on her finger, nails painted all spotty and a bright red lipstick to match the flowers in her dress, she really wowed me with this whole ensemble !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KATY PERRY ON-STAGE</span></b>
She really went for it with her stage performance, with this amazing Japanese kimono and Geisha hairstyle, and a bevy of parasol-bearing friends, all similarly dressed...for me this was an unconditional homage to a particular cultural style which she clearly loves - so is it really racist ? <i>Really.</i>..

Apparently she has received a lot of unpleasant comments on Twitter, and other places too, calling her a racist for this outfit - one woman, who appears to be actually from an Indian-Asian background judging by her name, said she felt <i>physically sick</i> when she saw it, as if the TV had punched her in the face (?!!) - so what do you think ? Did she go too far with this, or is it simply fabulous ?

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KENDALL JENNER</span></b>
Kendell is an American model, TV personality and fashion designer - and also half sister to the famous Kardashian clan, and therefore appears regularly in their TV show !! I&#39;m not that familiar with her or her younger sister Kylie, but I have seen her at various events like this before.
I think she looks amazing here, in this asymmetric white mini-dress with cut-outs and huge statement necklace - if you don&#39;t have a figure like this, don&#39;t even <i>consider</i> wearing such a brief little get-up !! I love the dark sleek hair, flawless make-up that doesn&#39;t look too heavy or too orange either, and the bright red lipstick is a winner !!
This is a real statement outfit, and the statement appeared to be &quot;<i>Harry - over here...&quot;</i> (yes, Kendall&#39;s name has been irrevocably linked to Harry Styles at the AMAs, even with his ex,Taylor Swift in attendance too - so the Press would have us believe it all got a bit fraught there for a moment !! )

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LADY GAGA</span></b>
Not to be outdone by all the younger girlies flashing their pins on the red carpet, Lady Gaga made her entrance in her usual over-the-top style - on the back of a full scale white horse, in the style of the &#39;<i>War Horse</i>&#39; puppet, manned by two guys in white tights...
Having said that, she actually looked pretty normal for a change, with her long hair down straight, and dressed in a lilac dress with chain detail across the bodice, designed by Donnatella Versace for her Spring 2014 Collection...

This was a dress I picked out at the Milan Fashion Week Collections, and it seems to have been adapted slightly with slightly different chains down the front for La Gaga...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MAIA MITCHELL</span></b>
Maia looked simply lovely in this gorgeous little black velvet dress with spectacular beaded back detail...I loved this outfit for both its simplicity and its sheer understated style - beautiful choices, both the dress and the accessories - great shoes and a simple little bag. Dark sultry lipstick gave her a glamorous edge and her side-swept hairstyle was a winner !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MILEY CYRUS</span></b>
For once, Miley made it into my Best Dressed list - hurrah !! But not for her awful stage outfit - oh no, this was for the little white trouser suit she wore for her red carpet arrival !! I liked this enormously actually, and I know it isn&#39;t going to be to everybody&#39;s taste, but I thought it suited her wayward rebellious personality marvellously well, without compromising her integrity or the boundaries of good taste - well not much anyway !!
It&#39;s a simple white suit that doesn&#39;t have anything underneath, but it also doesn&#39;t show anything off that should have been covered up either !! I liked the huge gold safety pins detail on the trouser legs and the jacket, and I liked her hair swept to one side, teamed with her choice of delicate earrings, and her <i>au naturelle</i> make-up - quite a good look for her, I think !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ZENDAYA COLEMAN</span></b>
Zendaya looked fabulous in this beautiful, flowing white Donna Karan outfit from her Resort 2014 Collection (which sadly I didn&#39;t manage to cover this time - far too much other stuff to do !!)
I liked her chunky jewellery, much of which I coveted just a little...although she could have eased upon the bangles probably...but the huge hoop earrings went with her long straight hair, and the chunky rings went with the gorgeous diamant&eacute; bag and the snaky bangles on the left arm - it&#39;s the plain bangles that could have been left behind !!
Nevertheless, that&#39;s a small niggle, so she gets a Gold Star for this amazing look !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ZOE SALDANA</span></b>
Zoe went with a dress from the Roland Mouret Spring 2014 Collection, which, as you can see has been reversed for Zoe&#39;s red carpet outing !! This was also a dress that I picked out, and I must say that I don&#39;t usually like this kind of thing at all, and I was very unsure of that contrasting pale blue satin band down one edge. However, this collection was immensely beautiful, even in that unfinished raw-edged kind of way !!
I loved her very unconventional bracelet/ring - it goes with the dress perfectly and makes a style statement without being too over the top !!

<span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><b>WORST DRESSED !!</b></span>
Of course, there were<i> loads</i> of atrocious outfits at this event - it&#39;s a music awards ceremony after all - so here are the six worst !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CHILLI &amp; T-BOZ</span></b>
These two are of course the subjects of the &#39;<i>Totally T-Boz&#39;</i> reality TV documentary about the remaining members of the band TLC,&nbsp; but they really should get themselves a halfway decent stylist - there are good reasons why stars have sartorial help for events like this, and the alarming tendency for stars to gravitate towards either two-piece slag outfits like Chilli here, or the all-black Biker-from-Hell look is certainly one of them !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CHRISTINA AGUILERA</span></b>
It&#39;s a bit of a shame that Christina went for this Maria Lucia Hohan gown, as it doesn&#39;t do anything for her <i>at all</i> - however, it&#39;s not necessarily the dress at fault here !! the main reason it&#39;s not working well, is that she could do with a really great bra to go underneath and give her a really Wow-shape to go with her Marilyn Monroe look.
At the moment, her bosom looks a bit unsupported and too wide for her slender frame, and that&#39;s not a great look, well, not in my book anyway !! However, a great fitting bra will push them together and give her a sexy cleavage at the same time as minimising the side expanse - for want of a better phrase.
On the plus side, I love her big statement earrings to bits and covet them wildly !! Ditto her pretty little flower rings...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HEIDI KLUM</span></b>
Heidi went for something much more fun - a black fringed dress from Marchesa, which should really have gone out of their showroom in the hot little hands of someone else <i>entirely</i> !!
It&#39;s just the utter fussiness of this dress, with the frilly flounces, the lacy scraps of fabric clinging to the straps, the sheer see-through nature of the whole thing, and the fringes sweeping the floor all vying for attention !!
Having said all that, I loved her hair swept back in a smooth ponytail, and her amazing shoulder-length earrings !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KELLY OSBORNE</span></b>
Oh dear - what can I say ?!! Kelly here is a fashion commentator for one of the biggest channel in the US, and she can&#39;t choose something better than this monstrosity for her own appearance ?!!
The main trouble with this is that when you are big-bosomed, having a straight-across neckline gives your whole upper-body a square blocky shape - not a great look at all for Kelly, but actually, the dress would have looked rather pretty on someone with a very different shape.
Not only that - her short fringe with her round face-shape does the same thing - it makes her face seem wider than it is - all a bit of a double-whammy for Kelly I think...

And she&#39;s still<i> persistng</i> with that awful purple-lilac grey hair...beautifully intricate though her hairstyle is, the colour is so ageing !! This is truly in a special Bad Zone all of its own, isn&#39;t it !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">NICOLE RICHIE</span></b>
Nicole has been off our radar for a bit, but here she is, looking positively svelte in this Emilio Pucci gown - however, I <i>hate</i> the huge cut-outs, and the fact that the back is so low-curved we can almost see her bum - not a fantastic look is it ? When you see this from the front, it&#39;s not too bad - but when she turns round, you see what I mean.
In addition, her severely swept-up hairstyle is probably the most unflattering style I have seen for a good long while - save for Kelly&#39;s above of course !! Anything that makes your ears stick out has to be avoided at all costs, I think !!

Phoebe has been off our radar too, so I&#39;m glad to welcome her back along with Nicole - it&#39;s great to see that our favourite Worst Dressed stars are keeping up the good work !!

The American Music Awards have been entertaining this week, especially with all the gossip and stuff - so I hope you&#39;ve all enjoyed this post about the fashions as it&#39;s probably the only one that doesn&#39;t mention what Taylor said about Harry etc...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><span style=""color: rgb(222, 33, 16);"">LOTS OF LOVELY DRESSES !!</span></span></b>

The London Evening Standard Theatre Awards were held at the Savoy Hotel in town on Sunday, and there were quite a few pretty frocks on show, some of them daringly revealing despite the cold night air !! Come and see who turned out for the most prestigious theatre awards of the year...
<lj-cut>

<span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><b>BEST DRESSED</b></span>
There weren&#39;t that many really, but the ones that were outstanding were truly lovely...in my opinion. 

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ANNA CHANCELLOR</span></b>
Anna, who is currently appearing in <i>&#39;Private Lives</i>&#39; at the Gielgud Theatre in the West End, wore a long black skirt teamed with a white, frill-fronted blouse, and dangly gold earrings. Now, I don&#39;t go for this look usually, but it seems to be a favourite with older actresses, and usually they look dumpy - however, she is very tall and elegant, with her chestnut hair up so she carries this off extremely well. This kind of outfit definitely needs a tall slim figure to get the full effect.

<img alt=""Anna Chancellor 01"" height=""594"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/727556/727556_original.jpg"" title=""Anna Chancellor 01"" width=""395"" /> &nbsp; <img alt=""Anna Chancellor 02"" height=""594"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/727980/727980_original.jpg"" title=""Anna Chancellor 02"" width=""395"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">BARBARA WINDSOR</span></b>
Barbara Windsor, on the other hand, is not so tall and slim, so she went on the other direction, with a simply fabulous black Empire-line dress that had a wide low-cut neckline and sheer sleeves - this is the best possible shape for her figure. It&#39;s both flattering and glamorous, so if you are shaped like Anna, you can get away with high buttoned blouses but if you&#39;re more like Barbara here, then go for the wide open V-neckline for the best and most flattering look !!
I liked her brassy blonde hair piled up high and minimal but well defined make-up, which took her right away from the tarty barmaid look she is usually associated with in her TV roles !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HAYLEY ATTWELL</span></b>
Hayley wowed every one at this event in this amazing Julien Macdonald dress from his Spring 2014 Collection. Not everyone liked this look, with some remarking that it looked far too revealing for this event, and the fact that Hayley is a tad too well-endowed for a style like this. I disagree about it not being event-appropriate, but I do see what the critics mean about her being well-endowed - it is a tad too revealing I suppose !! On the other hand, she carries it off with confidence and looks great in it. I love the cobwebby backless look and I love the beading sequinned style of the embellishments. I don&#39;t find her bright red lipstick too showy for the dress, but I think silver bag and watch would have been better than the gold !!
I love the dangly earrings and her whole general polished look...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HELEN McRORY</span></b>
Helen is currently appearing in &#39;<i>The Last of the Haussman&#39;s</i>&#39; at the National&#39;s Lyttelton Theatre, and was nominated for Best Actress, but lost out to Dame Helen Mirren !! Helen wore a beautiful gold-beaded cream dress that was both flattering and elegant too. I would have preferred it if she had worn a slightly more definite lipstick colour, but never mind - she still looked a million dollars in this...

<img alt=""Helen McCrory 01"" height=""594"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/730161/730161_original.jpg"" title=""Helen McCrory 01"" width=""395"" /> &nbsp; <img alt=""Helen McCrory 02"" height=""594"" src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/wendylady2/10229249/730585/730585_original.jpg"" title=""Helen McCrory 02"" width=""395"" />

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">HELEN MIRREN</span></b>
Dame Helen Mirren won the Natasha Richardson Award for Best Actress of course, for her role in &#39;<i>The Audience</i>&#39;, playing Queen Elizabeth II again - a role which may well go to Broadway soon perhaps...
She looks fabulous in this gorgeous Bruce Oldfield creation - black with cream satin bodice and sleeves give her a very glamorous look indeed. Add to that her amazing dangly earrings, which have an appealingly vintage look about them, and her short sassy haircut, and she oozes glamour and sophistication for this event. She carries off my Gold Star for being the best of the best...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JANET STREET-PORTER</span></b>
Janet Street-Porter hasn&#39;t ever appeared in this journal before, I don&#39;t think, so therefore I am very pleased that she makes it to my Best Dressed list this time - she looked amazing in this beautiful burgundy beaded dress, which complements her hair colour beautifully !! It&#39;s a fitted shape with high neckline and long sleeves - a much more covered up look which Janet carries off as she is pretty tall and slim.
I love her choice of dark red dangly earrings, but her lipstick could have matched a bit better. Hey-ho - she looks great anyway...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ZOE WANAMAKER</span></b>
Zoe went for this amazing 1950s-style vintage-look - a real cocktail dress in rich cobalt-blue, with matching cobalt-blue shoes, and vintagey turquoise diamant&eacute; earrings. Happily she went for a contrasting cream silk wrap and black bag, which stopped it being too matchy-matchy !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">WORST DRESSED</span></b>
Not many ladies made it into this category - and only one got as far as this post...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">OLIVIA WILLIAMS</span></b>
Olivia took my Worst Dressed Award, sadly for this totally nondescript grey shift-dress, embellished with gold leaves around the neckline and hem. The thing about this outfit which really makes it go wrong for me is the choice of thick black tights, black shoes and bag - far too heavy all round. She should have considered maybe lighter-weight black or natural coloured tights with gold shoes and bag to match the gold leaves. This would lighten everything and glam it up considerably, in my opinion!!

I like this event - it&#39;s the most prestigious Theatre event in the London calendar, and usually yields some amazing dresses without being too long with too many attendees, which makes my posts too much work sometimes !! This was an event which I was able to get written this morning before going to work, which is fab !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;""><span style=""color: rgb(185, 8, 212);"">THE BEST, THE WORST - AND THE MOST OUTLANDISH !!</span></span></b>

This Sunday, the 10th November, was the occasion of the latest Music awards from those nice people at MTV - the Europe Music Awards 2013 were handed out at the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam, and the whole occasion was a whole-hearted celebration of everything that Euro-Pop has come to mean...Eurovision - eat yer heart out !!

<lj-cut>
<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">THE BEST DRESSED</span></b>
This was a fairly typical music awards event, with everyone either dressing up to the nines or not bothering at all, particularly the guys !! Some good Best Dressed outfits though, with most of the women making a great effort, with some variable results !! Some women were, of course, pushing the envelope of good taste as usual, but this is to be expected, especially when you hear that Miley Cyrus is involved !!
So let&#39;s go see the Best Dressed first...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ANNA DRIJVER</span></b>
Anna is a Dutch model and TV/Film actress, who is very well known over in Europe, but not known at all here in the UK. She looked fabulous here in this short nude dress adorned with black sequins. With her hair swept back in a simple high ponytail and fabulous statement jet earrings, she looked amazing !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">BRIDGIT MENDLER</span></b>
Bridgit was one of the best dressed at this event, in my opinion - even with the high standard of the Best Dressed list. She looked lovely - very elegant and stylish, in this simple black dress from AQ/AQ, which had a partly separated bodice, but because it wasn&#39;t too skimpy, it didn&#39;t look in the least bit tacky or tarty. It had a centre-back slit instead of the more usual side slit, which meant it was plain all round the front. She wore her hair up in a messy updo and kept her make-up very simple, but well-defined with dark red lipstick. A simple gold necklace finished off her outfit and the whole look was so glamorous, but in an understated way - fabulous !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CARO EMERALD</span></b>
Caro was born <span class=""st"">Caroline Esmeralda van der Leeuw, and is a famous jazz singer from the Netherlands. She sings under her stage name of Caro Emerald and has had a UK no.1 in our album charts with her second album <i>&#39;The Shocking Miss Emerald&#39;</i></span> - so not entirely unknown here in the UK then !! As this is a music awards ceremony, there is a much bigger amount of leeway with what you are expected to wear on the red carpet, and this kind of outfit you can get away with easily, even though it&#39;s much more of a daytime outfit than an evening one. I love her beret and stripy jumper which evokes the Breton look, but with the small amount of glitz in the gold sequins round the neckline, it has just the right amount of sparkle to make it a party outfit.
Compared to some of the other ladies here, she looks fun but amazingly glamorous...just saying !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CHER LLOYD</span></b>
Cher is a Brit of course, coming fourth in the 2010 series of <i>X-Factor, </i>after which she was signed pretty sharpish to Simon Cowell&#39;s own music label <i>Syco Music</i>.&nbsp; She landed the amazing job of co-hosting the American telecast of the MTV EMAs for American TV along with Darren Criss, Andrew Schulz, Jason Derulo, Austin Mahone, and Ariana Grande. The show went well apparently, and everyone loves Cher over there in the US...

She chose this beautiful little beaded Art Deco-style dress with long sleeves and high neckline, which is pretty much the best way to wear a very short dress like this !! She also went for the high ponytail and statement earrings too, and went for a much heavier make-up look, which looked glamorous without being overdone - in other words, she didn&#39;t look fake-tanned or orange !!
The other thing is if you are going to wear short ankle boots with a mini-dress, do it this way - wear matching opaque tights with them, then your legs don&#39;t look cut off at the ankles, or too short !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">KATY PERRY</span></b>
Katy looked totally smashing in this pale aqua-green satin cocktail dress designed by Zac Posen, from his Resort 2014 Collection. She wore a Dolce &amp; Gabbana headband encrusted with jewels which certainly livened up the whole look, and Charlotte Olympia platform sandals !! I love this whole outfit on Katy - the dress fits her amazing figure beautifully as only a Zac Posen dress can - (she should maybe have considered going commando though, as we can see the outline of her thong, which may be just the angle the camera has caught her at.) With her swept back into that headband and fabulously applied make-up including mega-watt lashes, she looks a million dollars !

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LAURA WHITMORE</span></b>
Laura chose this black embroidery on white satin peplum-dress from the Fyodor Golan Autumn 2013 Collection for her red carpet outing. As she was one of the Red Carpet TV co-presenters at this event, it was important that she looked good considering that she would be on the red carpet throughout the arrivals, talking to everyone about how they were feeling prior to winning (or not, as the case may be) and whether they chose the outfits they were wearing etc... You can&#39;t do all that if you aren&#39;t looking good yourself, and this outfit is lovely for that - unusual and memorable, but pretty and not too provocative !!

I like her hair in this slightly messy half plaited style, but maybe it could have done with being a bit more combed out...perhaps !! She went for cross-strapped platform shoes designed by Kurt Geiger, which look positively lightweight next to all the other platforms being worn, but I do like them - they are dainty and graceful, even though they have around one and a half extra inches on the sole..

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LI YUCHUN (CHRIS LEE)</span></b>
Li Chuyun (also known here as Chris Lee) is a Chinese actress and pop singer, and she won the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Worldwide Act, edging out the favourite EXO, apparently...
She went for this amazing ensemble, comprising a shorts and jacket encrusted with sequins from the Versace Resort 2014 Collection, teamed with a black beaded coat from the Lanvin Pre-fall 2013 Collection - what a combo !! She has a reputation for her androgynous style, with some website mistakenly referring to her as a guy, probably due to her chosen English name of &#39;Chris&#39; <i>(idiots !!)</i> and her no-gown red carpet policy...
I think she looked great in this, and it&#39;s fantastic for a music awards ceremony, but maybe not for a bigger event - say the Oscars...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LOUISE ROE</span></b>
Louise did some of the Red Carpet presenting alongside Laura Whitmore, and so she really needed to look great - and she did. She went for this brightly coloured peachy print dress, from Mara Hoffman&#39;s Spring 2014 Collection, teamed with strappy silver sandals. Although it&#39;s a very pretty dress, it seems a little summery really given the time of year, but that doesn&#39;t really matter, I don&#39;t think !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">RITA ORA</span></b>
Rita chose a vampy black evening dress with a plunging neckline and revealing side slits, and a real Marilyn Monroe-esque look with the platinum blonde hair and bright red lips - fabulous all round, in my opinion, unlike some of the similar dresses in my Worst Dressed list below - you see, it&#39;s not <i>what</i> you wear, it&#39;s all about<i> how</i> you wear it...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">THE WORST DRESSED</span></b>
As this is a music awards ceremony, it goes without saying that there will be more slip-ups, sartorially speaking, than say, the Oscars !! Having put that statement out there, I will go on to say that this event had more than I would have expected - and mostly of the underwear or not variety...but then, Ms Cyrus was in attendance, and we <i>all</i> know what that means...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ARIANA GRANDE</span></b>
Ariana went for a Mikael D design from the Resort 2012 Collection - I have no love for this underwear style of dressing as you all know - there&#39;s something akin to having your bra straps showing in wearing a dress that l;ooks like a 1960s slip. Black lace on a white or nude satiny background is just too much like underwear for my taste...especially when it&#39;s a short dress like this.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ELLIE GOULDING</span></b>
Ellie went for the latest in trendy full length black all-lace dresses from Dolce &amp; Gabbana for her red carpet appearance, but sadly she left her good judgement behind when it came to her underwear. It&#39;s a difficult question though - what to wear under a dress like this, isn&#39;t it ?
I would personally advise <i>not</i> choosing any dress that hasn&#39;t solved the problem for you by having a sheer lining of some kind, so that you can still see the lace effect but don&#39;t reveal all your sundries to the world at large !!
If you must go for an all-revealing dress like this, don&#39;t, <i>under any circumstances</i> go for such huge Granny knickers - the ones that come up to the waist are for wearing under trousers so that they leave no VPL...that&#39;s why they have been revisited by shops such as M &amp; S, as they are real problem-solvers for the slim trousers we&#39;re all wwearing these days !! For dresses like this however, they just leave you open to ridicule by the Fashion Press, as poor Ellie here has found out to her cost this week !!

The best thing to wear under a dress like this is probably your black knickers you usually wear, combined with a longer sheer silk camisole, which will give you an extra fine layer over your whole torso, without hiding the lace fabric. Or maybe choose a different dress - up to you...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">EVA SIMONS</span></b>
I do like Eva Simons whacky style, I must say, and this wildly patterned black and white poncho-style outfit with matching leggings is really something else - eye-catching and unusual, and somewhat Mexican Tribal in feel - however, what I don&#39;t like about her whole look is the fantastically ridiculous hair...far too much quiff going on !!
Everything else is just fab...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">IGGY AZALEA</span></b>
Oh dear - <i>how </i>much leg ?!! Iggy here is a model and rapper from Australia, who just loves a slinky little black number - perhaps a little too much ? There are <i>much</i> more revealing photos on the Internet (cough*<span style=""font-size:0.7em;""><i>Perez Hilton</i></span>*cough) from this red carpet walk, but I prefer to keep it clean here at the Fashion Police headquarters, suffice to say that she is barely wearing anything <i>at all</i> under this...
The dress is actually from the Dilekj Hanif Spring 2-11 Collection, but it didn&#39;t look as raunchy as this on the runway, unsurprisingly - the model had a pair of those brief shorts-style panties on, which were perfect !!
See - you can be the best rap singer in the world, but if all people remember you for is revealing your Brazilian on the MTV red carpet, then all is not good in your world...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LENA MEYER LANDRUT</span></b>
Another midriff-on-show cut-out dress, although this one is more of a two piece isn&#39;t it ?!! I like this much less than Bridgit Mendler&#39;s dress, and the main reason is that I would have vastly preferred this if it had a sheer black panel, or maybe lace in that space, rather than bare skin, and - oh, the frigging<i> bra straps !!</i> I could certainly have done without the extra bra straps showing - when will girls get to understand that bra straps really are NOT A GOOD LOOK !!
For Gawd&#39;s sake, get yourself a decent quality strapless bra for tops like this...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MILEY CYRUS</span></b>
Now then - Miley...you&#39;re beginning to look a tad desperate with this somewhat hacked about outfit from NY Vintage - this probably started life as a Biggie &amp; Tupac illustrated dress, but I reckon Fashion Critic is right about this, over here:-
<a href=""http://www.redcarpet-fashionawards.com/2013/11/10/miley-cyrus-2013-mtv-emas/#comments"" target=""_blank"">http://www.redcarpet-fashionawards.com/2013/11/10/miley-cyrus-2013-mtv-emas/#comments</a>

She reckons that this was a T-shirt dress that has been &#39;<i>hoochified</i>&#39; - a totally great word that describes Miley Cyrus herself, pretty much exactly, I reckon...it&#39;s tacky, cheap and desperate for attention, as were her on-stage antics with the twerking with her co-dancers, and the pulling of a joint from her bag and lighting it up in front of an audience - and why wasn&#39;t she arrested as soon as she came off-stage ? - well, that&#39;s Amsterdam for you !! As they sell the stuff quite legally in their caf&eacute;s, it isn&#39;t such a crime over there - thus the Dutch were as unshocked as you or I, I expect !! Yeah, yeah - whatever...

Just like her Canadian male counterpart Justin Bieber, she is trying to be rebellious by behaving badly, but both she and Justin are both just playing at it - they are forgetting that <i>we&#39;ve seen it all before</i>, in an industry that thrives on bad behaviour, and now it&#39;s just irritating...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">THE GUYS</span></b>
Lots of guys at these awards of course, but only two were worth mentioning for their sartorial antics:-

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">JEDWARD</span></b>
This is of course, John and Edward Grimes, the Irish twins who entered the Eurovision Song Contest twice representing Ireland, in 2011 and 2012. They always dress the same whenever they are out and about in their professional capacity - at the MTV EMAs they wore matching white satin jackets adorned with all the Eurovision countries&#39; flags !! Crazy I know, but there you go...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">STEFAN GORDY</span></b>
This is Redfoo, the American rapper, DJ and MC at this event of course - he chose this black crocodile-textured suit which he teamed with white framed glasses !! I liked it actually, and thought it was one of the more interesting outfits worn by any of the men there...

The MTV Europe Music Awards are one of the first of the whole succession of music awards ceremonies that take place in and around the last two months of the year, including the Latin Grammys on 21st November, the American Music Awards on the 24th, the American Country Awards on December 2nd, and the Grammy Awards on 26th January 2014...
I look forward to covering most of these, if time allows !!

I came across this<i> fabulous</i> set of pictures from a Frederick&#39;s of Hollywood catalogue dating from Spring 1973, and simply could not<i> resist</i> sharing them...
Hands up who owned something like this back then - and who would seriously wear one of these now ?!!

<lj-cut text=""Come and share the retro fashion fun !!..."">
Now, of course, I&#39;m not really referring to the evening dresses - they are still acceptable, and probably would get into my Best Dressed lists for a red carpet event, if the general standard was a little pedestrian !! They&#39;re not that interesting...

...just get a load of those amazing bell-bottom flares - aren&#39;t they incredible !! Bootylicious...

Apart from photo 2 and 3, where the two styles are actually top and trousers, the rest of them seem to be styled as jumpsuits, but with curves and cut-outs and flares to die for - but how do you go to the loo ?!! An ordinary jumpsuit would have a zip up the front and you&#39;d simply unzip and pull the whole lot down, but these must have back zips, side zips, have to go over the head, etc, etc...

&quot;<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">WOWER POWER</span></b>
Jump into mischief!! Tri-tone pantastic has plunge-bra top that comes to the point(s) fast ! Fits good and tight down to tri-colored knee flares. Back buttons high, disappears into nothing, ties at the waist..$45&quot;

The text for the white suit with the waist ring states:-

&quot;<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">THE CLINCHER&quot;</span></b>
He&#39;ll zero in for the clinch when you wear this three-ring cincher !! Plunge midriff top with back buttons with giant open front and side rings. Skin-tight pants with flares and back zip....$50&quot;

And the most scary of all...&quot;<i>Junior sizes 5 - 13&quot;</i>
Peadophile-traps all...

Here&#39;s a real curiosity - a huge piece of faux-amber, with a real scorpion inside - an amazing example of the forger&#39;s art !! Lord knows why anyone would want this to actually wear, but it is extremely interesting in its own right as a curio, I think...

Here&#39;s another curio - this is a real Spider Orchid flower encased in 24K gold plating - a beautiful delicate brooch from the Singapore-based &#39;RISIS&#39; company, worth about $60SD, which is about equivalent to around &pound;30, I think...

I love this simple little silver bracelet with its red stone set in the middle - quite small, and made for a slender wrist, this is another piece for anyone who likes delicate jewellery pieces !!

If you like any of these, take a punt and see if you can win them in the auctions which are ending tomorrow - or come on over and see the rest if the 24 items I currently have for sale on e-bay:-

<span style=""color:#c70838;""><b><span style=""font-size: 1.8em;"">ISABEL MARANT - VIVIENNE WESTWOOD</span></b></span>
My second look at Paris Fashion Week includes a new name for me - Isabel Marant, and an occasional name for me, Manish Arora - both designers are not particularly popular on the red carpet, but both should be, in my opinion !! Also, I have designs by Lanvin,&nbsp; Nina Ricci, perennial favourite Roland Mouret, Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent, Valentino of course, and resurrected label, Vionnet, as well as Vivienne Westwood&#39;s slightly more expensive Black Label collection.

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ISABEL MARANT</span></b>
I&#39;m going to start with a new name for me - although she has been around for a good few years now, Isabel Marant isn&#39;t that well known for red carpet dresses chosen by the Hollywood set, or anyone else famous for that matter !! However, she came out with some really beautiful sheer, chiffony print dresses that I loved - beautiful ruffley shapes and some glittery black prints too - see what you think !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">LANVIN</span></b>
Alber Elbaz has been very successful with this old Paris fashion house for many years - so much so that he can virtually call the shots with it - this season, he experimented with sparkly, shiny metallic fabrics, lacey overlays, pleats, and lots of ruffles - all very disco / party kind of stuff - perfect for the average Film Festival charity ball or minor red carpet event...and keep a look out too, for some of these at the numerous music awards events coming up in November...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MANISH ARORA</span></b>
I love Manish Arora&#39;s work - he is so adventurous and colourful, with lots of embroidery, beading and fringing - fun and playful, that&#39;s the embodiment of his style. This time, he really went overboard with the fluorescent colours - pinks and yellows, aquas and turquoises - and girlie motifs - lipsticks, bead necklaces and hearts, and even one dress that looked like a beaded electronic circuit board !! Flapper shapes and wrap skirts with tunic tops make this an incredibly easy collection to wear, if you love bright colours. Expect some of these to turn up at the music awards and festivals, I reckon !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">NINA RICCI</span></b>
Peter Copping at Nina Ricci came out with a bit of experimentation with male / female styling combined together - a lace dress under a collarless redingote-style coat, and a waistcoat and skirt in white, very tailored but very evening. Even a sheer blouse with a dress-shirt front of pleats was simply gorgeous stuff !! I like this development at Nina Ricci, as the house style is so utterly feminine - one of the<i> girliest</i> fashion brands in Paris usually, so it makes a nice change !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ROLAND MOURET</span></b>
Roland Mouret is one of the most popular designers for the red carpet, maybe not necessarily for the biggest events like the Oscars, but for the smaller events and parties - he is very much a go-to designer for sassy little cocktail dresses. This collection was very much a typical Mouret collection, except a bit rougher - in other words, he wanted to create a raw-edged look, as if the finished garments were still half on the drawing board. I loved the evening wear - sections of black lace layered over white lace combined with sections of bias-cut satin, with black straps, as if gaffer tape had been used in their construction !

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">SAINT LAURENT</span></b>
Hedi Slimane has been pretty successful appointment over at the House of Saint Laurent, starting his career there with an amazingly modern take on the traditional Saint Laurent look, and gradually switching over to his own signature trashy rock-chick Chelsea Girl signature handwriting. This collection pretty much seals the deal with short little fun dresses, ruffled and frilled with small-scale funky prints - small black motifs on white and dark red, shiny lurex printed with tiger stripes, and lots of gold lam&eacute;. It was a very 80s style collection I thought, with reference to Debbie Harry and other Punk/New Wave girls - lots of leather jackets combined with girly, ruffled, full-skirted little dresses, and lots of brass-studded black leather accessories !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">VALENTINO</span></b>
Valentino went really out on a limb for next Spring - Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli visited the opera apparently, more specifically <i>&#39;Medea</i>&#39; - well, Pasolini&#39;s film version starring Maria Callas, anyway - and came out with their heads full of heavily embellished full-length dresses with intricate embroideries, and all-enveloping plain, quite<i> monastic </i>dresses, with long sleeves and high necks, worn with gold zodiac pendants and flat sandals - there was something of North Africa here, combined with a bit of Mexico and maybe ancient Persia - lots of influences and amazing details. How many of these will find their way onto the red carpet ? Who knows...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">VIONNET</span></b>
The old relaunched House of Vionnet has gone through several designers already - first of all, it was Sophia Kokosalaki, who was hired by the French owners of the dormant brand back in 2006, and then she was unexpectedly replaced by Marc Audibet, who produced a highly acclaimed collection in October 2007 for Spring 2008, before suddenly resigning and being replaced by a pool of designers who weren&#39;t named - the French company who owned the brand were quoted as saying &quot;<i>&quot;Vionnet doesn&#39;t need to be associated with a designer&#39;s name, it&#39;s an institution&quot; - </i>hmmm...

Anyway, after that, in February 2009, Matteo Marzotto announced the acquisition of the label and the creation of a new base in Milan where Vionnet is now operating from - last year, In May 2012 Goga Ashkenazi purchased a majority stake in the brand, and she now heads both the creative and business sides of the company. It will remain to be seen what happens next, but all this just goes to underline just how difficult it really is to resurrect a brand after it has been silent for 65 years or so...
The collection for next Spring was a beautiful one, if a little ordinary - I liked some of the evening dresses as they were very much in the style of the original designer&#39;s handwriting - lots of Grecian style folds and drapes, with a little bias-cutting and some revealing sides and backs on show...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">VIVIENNE WESTWOOD</span></b>
Lots of really great stuff from Dame Viv for next Spring - more than usual actually. All her favourite signature shapes and historical references were here - the shepherdess dress, the 17th Century cloak, the Edwardian bustle-dress, the corset - as well as some new ones - the 50s party dress, the ancient Grecian gown...

We&#39;ll certainly see some of these on show next Spring, I am sure !!

Lots of stuff to think about before next Spring then - the big Awards season is going to be a fun one, I think !! The Music Awards Season kicking off in November will be the first big awards events in the season, so stay tuned !!

<span style=""color:#c21ad9;""><b><span style=""font-size: 1.8em;"">1 : ALEXANDER McQUEEN - GIVENCHY</span></b></span>

Part 1 of Paris Fashion Week is here !! This finished on Wednesday, so this is possibly the earliest I&#39;ve ever managed to get this up online for a while...hurrah !!
I&#39;ve decided to split PFW into two parts because, like New York, it&#39;s a very long week with more designers to cover than can be fitted sensibly into one post.

Paris is still the most popular city for the very high end of fashion - couture dresses for red carpet events, whereas New York is more popular for the RTW evening dresses - slightly cheaper but more accessible cost-wise than your average Dior !! It has to be said though that most couture dresses seen on the red carpet are actually borrowed from the designer&#39;s studio - great publicity for the brand - whereas most RTW dresses have been bought by the star, mainly on the advice of a stylist. Therefore the RTW Collections are important in that respect - so come on in and see my predictions for the up and coming red carpet events from the Paris RTW Collections for next Spring...
<lj-cut>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ALEXANDER McQUEEN</span></b>
This collection marks a bit of a new direction for Sarah Burton I think - she drew inspiration from &#39;found objects&#39;, and it showed in interesting tribal-like influences, which made me think that much of what she found was actually on the National Geographic Channel !! Lots of beads, feathers and other tribal bits and pieces, as well as recycled plastic and metal. As she put it - &quot;<i>I didn&#39;t want it to feel too referenced to a period or a theme...I was saying something new, saying something personal, and I didn&#39;t want to do &#39;big&#39; gowns,&quot;</i> said Burton. <i>&quot;I wanted energy without froth.</i>&quot;

So no huge dresses with heavy embroidery this time, which is good as she&#39;s been experimenting with them for the last few seasons now - time for something new !!
As for whether these will make an appearance anywhere though, it&#39;s really hard to tell - I liked the white dresses with black studs and lines across the skirts, and I think the more elaborate feathered designs will turn up on some of the wackier music awards shows perhaps - I can certainly imagine someone like Nicky Minaj wearing one of the feathered dresses below...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ANDREW GN</span></b>
For much more traditional evening gowns though, Andrew Gn is your man !! I love his work, as he always comes out with something new and different - this time, he revisited modern art and took inspiration from his own burgeoning art collection in the form of the dove motif from Georges Braque, padded coils of satin forming straps, and a gorgeous cubist motif involving a split guitar and a pot from Pablo Picasso - if I have a favourite here though, it has to be the gold embroidered Braque doves swooping across a black evening dress which I really want someone to wear to something big !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CHALAYAN</span></b>
Hussein Chalayan isn&#39;t a big player in the red carpet market, but I wish he was - his innovative ideas have been really ground-breaking in the past !! He manages to combine art and science together in a really beautiful way, with dresses that transform into hats before your very eyes, and dresses that move in the wind, and maybe turn into tables and vice-versa - it&#39;s like a grab bag of conjuring tricks that only the likes of Cate Blanchett would have the nerve to wear !!

No such shenanigans this time though - this was a straightforward collection with some beautiful shapes and some big sun-hats on sticks - I loved the slim column dresses with triangles of bias-cut fabric inserted into the front forming interesting draping round the neckline, and I also loved the multi-coloured dresses covered with what looked like brightly coloured post-it notes, fluttering in the breeze as the models walked down the runway...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CHANEL</span></b>
Karl Lagerfeld really pushed the creative envelope with his take on the traditional Chanel tweed jacket this time...deconstructed, collaged, chopped around and changed, and put back together again - this was &#39;Fashion as Art&#39; and fashion being inspired by art processes - this seemed to be a whole trend running through the Paris fashion collection this time.
Many new ideas emerged from Karl&#39;s prodigious imagination, including the set for his runway show, which was in the form of a huge art exhibition with artworks lining the walls, and even the addition of red dots on certain works gave the impression that everything was for sale !!
I loved the shocking pink tweedy knitwear, and the monochromatic black, white and grey tweed suits and dresses,

This was really something new from Karl too - gorgeous dress designs using paint-charts from the 1900s as inspiration for a beautiful multi-coloured print - they really had wow-factor !! They were kind of similar to Chalayan&#39;s post-it note dresses...only more so !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">CHRISTIAN DIOR</span></b>
Raf Simons gave us a pretty innovative Dior collection this time - he referred to it as <i>&#39;Trans-Dior</i>&#39;, which roughly translated means &#39;changing Dior&#39;, which is a very clear indication of what he means to do - the best example of this was a classic Bar trouser suit which looked quite ordinary until the model turned round, and you saw all the floral inset godets around the back of the jacket, which turned it into something else entirely !!
As for the red carpet possibles, the best were these short dresses with swathes of sunray and crinkle-pleated satin across beaded floral fabrics, and a whole array of stunningly beautiful, silver brocade evening and cocktail dresses, with shield-shaped badges embroidered onto the bodices - they looked like emblems of a secret society that only Dior models belong to !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ELIE SAAB</span></b>
Elie Saab went all out for the prettiest evening-wear award for next Spring, and as Style.com pointed out, he must get extra kudos points for finding ways of making sheer fabrics and see-through lace designs demure and non-revealing - and as the major part of his client&egrave;le are from the Middle East, this is a bit of a necessity for him !! The red carpet market in Hollywood is also pretty demure, in that most stars will sensibly get a dress lined before agreeing to wear it in front of the world&#39;s press cameras, so it sort of makes sense to show these dresses already lined when they go down the runway. It makes little sense to me to show dresses that are so sheer that no-one wants to wear them in that state.

For next Spring, I was delighted to see that Elie Saab has gone for a print - yes, a print !! - and an extravagantly beautiful one too !! I am <i>convinced</i> that the white dresses with the water-colour poppy print will be his best sellers of the season. The black/grey sparkly version of this print won&#39;t be far behind either...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">GARETH PUGH</span></b>
Well - this was an unexpected show from Gareth !! We&#39;re so used to seeing the most futuristic, architectural shapes and impossible-to-wear stuff from him, that the long dresses that opened the show in bright turquoise really surprised everyone...and the dresses were probably the most wearable designs from him yet. As he is toning down the outer-space styling and softening the edges of what he designs, he is becoming much more accessible, whilst still being an incredibly innovative designer.
&quot;<i>We sometimes have the tendency to rein things in,</i>&quot; said Pugh after his show.<i> &quot;With this collection, I wanted to go against that. It&#39;s that idea that if you&#39;re pleasing everyone, you&#39;re doing something wrong! Sometimes you&#39;re trapped in the expectations of what other people think of you. I wanted the collection to be immaculate but hysterical somehow&quot;</i>
This collection had some amazing semi-circular curved shoulders and beautiful draped collars, sitting stop long column gowns, and the whole black, silver and white colour scheme with injections of brilliant turquoise really was beautiful - and memorable !!

The sad fact is that no-one wears Gareth&#39;s designs on the red carpet, but I really wish they would - like Chalayan and Lee McQueen before him, he is one of fashion&#39;s wild cards, and it would really shake things up in Hollywood if someone - Cate, Tilda, anyone - would wear one of his amazing space-age gowns to the Oscars !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">GIVENCHY</span></b>
I am not really a huge fan of Riccardo Tisci&#39;s work for Givenchy, as the designs that turn up on the red carpets usually end up in my Worst Dressed lists - however for once, I could imagine some of these designs working pretty well on a red carpet - the African-inspired twisted and draped jersey dresses with tribal detailing were absolutely beautiful, and would suit most stars - ignoring the heavy-handed beaded face masks, the sheer draped jersey fabric combined with leather straps worked extremely well.
I also loved the gorgeous striped fabrics inspired by North African textiles, draped and knotted as they should be...

Milan Fashion Week ended last Monday, and Paris is currently on show, as we speak - therefore, for me, this is relatively on time - hurrah !! I now aim to have the Sunday evening red carpet events like the Emmys written up by Wednesday evening, and fashion week reports done by Sunday, the following weekend !!

Milan was only six days, but there were at least ten designers producing beautiful and exciting red-carpet wear, for us to speculate over...

<lj-cut>

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ALBERTA FERRETTI</span></b>
Alberta Ferretti produced a fabulously out-of-character show of youthful designs, in energetic bright colours - beautiful embroidered florals and exciting broad stripes made this collection one of the most exuberant of the week - gorgeous hot shades and wonderful swathes of flowers against plain white or black, with threaded satin ribbons and circular prints on sunray-pleated mousselines. There was more than a hint of Spanish/South American influence in the peasant-style embroidery, tiered flounces, and hot colours which I liked immensely...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">DOLCE &amp; GABBANA</span></b>
Sicily has been a fantastic source of inspiration for the Dolce &amp; Gabbana team lately - for the last three collections at least, it has provided amazing prints and colours in the shape of beautiful mosaics and religious icon imagery...now it is the turn of the ancient ruins to be the source of inspiring photographic digital prints, and the ancient Greek / Roman world to be the source of accessory design - earrings, prize-fighter style belts, shoes and bags were all derived from the coins and columns of the ancient world !!

Although there were a few designs that didn&#39;t stick to the Ancient Greco-Roman theme, some of them are sure-fire party choices for Cannes or the like...these two little dresses are beautiful go-anywhere dresses, which would look great on anyone, I reckon !!

It was all <i>fabulously</i> silly, and probably won&#39;t appear on any red carpet, but I loved the quirky daftness of it all just the same...having said that, I could just imagine a few young stars in the all-gold shift dresses with huge gold coins at the waist !!
Here are some of the interestingly kitsch accessories:-

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">EMILIO PUCCI</span></b>
Marvellously complex monochromatic prints with a slightly ethnic flavour, and amazing sheath dresses in stretchy jersey fabrics - if they&#39;re on the same runway, it can only be the Emilio Pucci collection !! Like Dolce &amp; Gabbana, he too went for the prize-fighter-style belts with huge gold centrepieces. No-one mixes it up better than Peter Dundas, and all with a very sporty influence too. Actresses and musicians alike go for his amazing designs - Beyonc&eacute;, Rita Ora and Rihanna have all been wearing his stuff this year, so it&#39;s a fair bet for the red carpet then !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">FENDI</span></b>
The Fendi collection is, of course, designed by everyone&#39;s favourite over-achiever, Karl Lagerfeld !! For next Spring, he went for lightness, both of colours and weight of fabrics. His dresses were constructions of multiple layers, with the shades darkening as it got to the top layer - resulting in a beautiful ombr&eacute; kind of effect, but over maybe five or six layers of fabric. This was one story I really liked, and hope very much to see on a red carpet somewhere. It looks modern and innovative, whilst being an incredibly simple idea. He was inspired by light passing through water, which is what it suggests...
Laser-cutting and pleating also played a part in this collection,but it was definitely the graded, shaded layers that caught my eye !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">GIORGIO ARMANI</span></b>
The Giorgio Armani Collection was just beautiful, as always - light and airy, with floaty, fly-away fabrics, blurry water-colour prints and some simply<i> spectacular </i>hats, all paraded down a high-gloss runway !! The theme of this collection was this : &quot;<i>A woman who&#39;s free to fly but can carry her own weight, gentle but gutsy&quot;</i> was how Giorgio himself described it, and that&#39;s exactly how it came across too...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">GUCCI</span></b>
Frida Giannini brought out an intriguing mixture of ultra-sporty shapes involving raglan sleeves, easy kimono shapes and strappy tops, with sensational Art Nouveau-inspired prints in satiny and sometimes glittery luxe fabrics - all very 1970s St. Laurent in flavour, I thought, but the sporty shapes were a new way of looking at this type of thing !! I liked these a lot and I look forward to seeing them several times over the course of next Spring !!

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MISSONI</span></b>
Missoni is justly famous for its beautiful, fine zig-zag stripe knitwear of course, but this collection couldn&#39;t be further way from that aesthetic - this was a meditation on the four elements - earth, air, fire and water - all done in blocky print designs, with the colours edged round in jagged black outlines. This made it look just like old wood-cut prints, with birds flying out over the sea, and the desert meeting the mountains. The colours were amazing - bright, but not primary - duck-egg blue and orange, purple and coral, aqua and turquoise - all the secondary and tertiary (third layer) colours on the colour wheel, combined with black and white to give us a really <i>different </i>collection from them.
Will these be seen on the red carpets ? Who knows, but I hope so...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">MOSCHINO</span></b>
Apparently this year is the thirtieth anniversary of the Moschino brand and so there was a sense of retrospective celebration going on at the Moschino show, with several famous star models wearing pieces from the Moschino archive - the most iconic designs that say Moschino better than any others from the last thirty years. From the new design selections though, these pretty little 50s style dresses, some with demure little cardigans, will probably be the favourite red carpet choices, even if only for press calls and lesser film festival moments perhaps. No big ball-gowns here - except for a couple of full length dresses, it was mostly a day-wear collection !! Some good stuff though...

<b><span style=""font-size:1.4em;"">ROBERTO CAVALLI</span></b>
Roberto Cavalli is possibly the biggest red-carpet designer in Milan, from the stars point of view - Versace, Armani and Cavalli are the three biggest fashion designers working in Milan for<i> any</i> red carpet events...and Roberto Cavalli really went with that money-spinning principle big time - he brought out practically an entire collection geared up to the Awards ceremonies next Spring !! They were simply<i> amazing</i>, gorgeous beaded evening-wear, in pale dreamy colours, fading down into white or cream and silvery-grey - very romantic, typical Cavalli-style designs, and very, very pretty.
I also loved the interesting pendent box-clutches, with metal tassels hanging from the ends, and the fact they were chosen for each dress perfectly, some plain polished silver and others engraved with zig-zagging patterns all over. The black dresses got black crocodile printed leather ones edged in silver - gorgeous !!
I was also rather taken with the heavy silver wing necklaces and cuff-bracelets, with pairs of bird&#39;s heads edged in wing feathers all in silver - a rather heavy and over-wrought idea, but one which worked perfectly !!.

Donnatella went for a much harder look than usual, opening her show with biker rock-chic looks with much studded leather, and lots of attitude...the closing section of her show however, was a much more glamorous affair, with a few really stylish evening dresses, with slashed detailing and that rather risqu&eacute; look that she is famous for !!
I don&#39;t always like what she comes out with, and these dresses weren&#39;t the best I&#39;ve seen her do, but at least one or two will be worn on the Oscars red carpet - mark my words !!

Milan was a shorter fashion week than either New York or Paris, but still a day longer than London - I&#39;ve managed to stick to my self-imposed limit of ten designers pretty easily as Milan doesn&#39;t produce as much red carpet style as either New York or Paris, and isn&#39;t nearly as innovative as London...

&quot;Paris Fashion Week : part 1&quot; next weekend !!

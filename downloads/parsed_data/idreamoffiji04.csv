Of course we got sum weirdo to buy us drinks....we asked for 3 kamikazes but instead he replaced them with three 4 horseman which i took sips of little by little and took one to big of a sip and thre up in my hand but it was very non chalantly. I had hoped that no one noticed but to my dismay amanda saw me and was like dude i totally saw u throw up but of course she was a good sport about it and promptly handed me the napkins. After that i went to the Sigma Pi house then to the Sigma Nu house, which was not fun at all cuz it was a sausage fest and the sausges were cookin from watchin too much porn. Anyways today my friend called me at work and she too was at Empire and she had a tab open....well her fucking bill only ended up being 14 freakin dollars!!!!! And we definitley had well over 50 dollars worth of drinks which is alway always badass. Well that was my exciting weekend....that and working. Peace out sucka!!

"event","OMG I saw so many hot guys its unreal!!! On thursday after getting off of the shuttle bus a couple of girls walked up to me and jacked me haha j/k no they just wanted to know if i was interested in joining a sorority so i was like sure....hey y not? From there the chik (her name is bouchra pronounced bush-ra) is like so we're having an event tonight! You should come so i did.....it was at Taco Milagro (packed full of fine ass guys of course) and whatever whatever happens i smake small talk blah blah blah and a few the gurls are like yea u should totally come hang out with us tonight and i was like cool ok. We went to Empire where we did not have to wait in line nor pay a cover and partied with sum frat guys and a couple of them i actually knew it boosted my cool points :) We got some guys to buy us a couple of shots of kamikaze and then we left and on our way to the car we stopped at another club (which so happens to be a hookah/oxygen bar yes i found one in houston!!!) and immediatley met the bartender and befriended which afterwards proceeded to give us free drinks. After that whole ordeal we eneded up at Redstar which was pretty cool.....soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many hott guys (suprisingly i made out with no one that night, yet not a total loss) Of course did not have to pay a cover and got our drinks paid for us by the gullable male species. (that was weird) But yes that was my night and a mighty fine one at that. I got pretty tipsy yet still able to drive home....but yes many guys floated through the fantasies of carla.......oh how nice it is :) Oh yea and i got a bid from the sorority but havent accepted yet so we'll see.....well until another wild and crazy night or not so wild and crazy. Love and miss everybody!!!

"event","So One person has raised their share of the cali money for the cali trip.....i hope ya'll havent forgot cuz this is sumthing i painfully would love to do!! So far amanda has her money in.....once i start waiting these damn tables hopefully i'll get there.....and i need the rest of ya'll to not forget about our sun kissed vacation this summer!!! And we have to do this cuz after this summer mikael will be leaving us for snowy minnestoa!!!! So cmon' girlies and if we dont reach our goal of at least $1000 we will still have enough money to go sumwhere in this damn country!! Anyways on another note....hmmm.....oh yea useful advice for everyone: Never leave your LJ unattended (meaning dont leave it open on the comp. screen) and let your mom see what you wrote (especially if it is about being stoned and deciding in the middle of the night to get you nipple pierced) because your mother could happen to be standing over your shoulder reading it and that wouldn't be a very plesant conversation. This happened to some one i know who shall remain nameless....but still plans to get their nipple pierced :) And its not like my mom isnt used to finding out all the different and glorious ways i smoke. **It never ends** Well guys I love and miss everybody so dont be strangers!!!

It's so crazy cuz I usually dont know what the hell i'm doing and pull all the words out my ass but this time it was different. I read and studied not the night before, not a couple days before, but over a long period of time and it actually stuck with me!! I'm so excited i hope i recieve all 6 points that biatch was worth. So is houston weird or is it weird!!?? Yesterday i was wearing a halter rop and today i'm wearing 2 shirts jeans and a sweatshirt....crazy ass houston. Anyways yesterday I met with these sorority girls from Alpha Chi Omega and I must say i dont think i'm valley girl enough to join the soroity. They seemed very nice but all I heard was california this new york that....oooh how bout cabo san lucas this?? It was crazy cuz i'm like i dont think i even have enough money to travel to my backyard!! But hey they seemed like nice girls but i just don't think they're my crowd and i think they know that too. I told angie that me, her, and amanda should make our own soroity....the half white half mexican, but not quite white, not quite mexican girls club...teehee....but they do have multicultrual soroitys....maybe thats whats for me. But i hate to admit i do wanna join a sorority like alpha chi, ZTA, or Delta gamma....but hey whatryagonna do?? Well mis amigos i do miss everybody thats at their home away from home and i send all my love.....oh and by the way i got a new job, server at Chili's and man i know it seems like i just can't stay in one spot too long.

"event","So....so many things to talk about yet so little typing space...teehee. Anyways Saturday me and amanda went to this frat party which was quite badass. We met this guy there who would eventually smoke us out with Chronic....yes ya'll heard correct CHRONIC!!! I got pretty wasted....cuz in the middle of the party some random girl comes up to me and seems so delighted to see me. I was thinking man i'm so gone i'm imagining that i know this girl.....well i did know her it was Ari!! How cool was that??? So me, amanda, and ari start partying like we've never partied before. And before you know it we're driving around smokin the good stuff until the guy tries to jam is tounge down my throat...we got back to the party and luckily lost him in the crowd. About 20 minutes later my friend angie meets up with us and shes not even there 10 minutes when the party is shutdown by the po's!! Damn police they could all go to hell!! Anyways Ari met sum egyptian or iraqi guy and we go to his house with sum of the other guys from the frat and smoke outta their hooka...very fun....we smoked mixed berry. Then we smoke sum more grass and me and amanda are just so fucking gone to the point where amanda is getting freakishly paranoid....however she had a right to be.

At the iraqi guys house showed up 2 girls who seemed pretty cool in the beginning but turned out to be jealous whores. I guess they were getting jealous, actually from what i hear they were psychotic...they were mocking us and a whole bunch of other shit (so i'm told). They were pissed cuz we were all hanging out havin a good time and i think their boyfriends were also there talking with us....let me just say not one of us wanted to talk to any of those guys....we were just enjoying a good smoke. Needless to say we left and was like fuck all of ya'll but the guys were like no u can crash here cmon just crash here...no thank u was my response anyways.....gotta go ya'll love ya's and continue with yer smoke filled weekends!!! MWah

I leave u with a thought that i thought up myself!!! 
College is the smokefest of Life....so enjoy :)"

"event","So lastnight i was researching to find out where whe
should travel to in Socal and I suggest these beaches
which are near cities:

BEACHES:
Manhattan - 29 hours 41 minutes from Houston
Venice - 29h 39m
Santa Cruz - 29h 12m
Sunset - 28h 58m
Newport - 24h

And i think it would be easier to travel to LA
(23hours)  and find a cheap motel there, which i
really do think we can if we book early enough, and we
will be near all the major beaches. Let me know what
ya'll think. I've attached a map of LA and you're able
to see what beaches are nearby.

<img src=""file:///Users/carlahulsey/Desktop/mqmapgend.gif"">

When should we go? I was thinking the last week of
July cuz by then the first summer session of summer
school will be over.....ya'll let me know if anybody
is planning to do 2 summer sessions cuz in that case
we would have to go early to mid August when the 2nd
summer session lets out. 

This is to give ya'll an idea of how much the hotel
will be. By the way i got the rates for july 29 - 31 
Hotels.com - Goodnite Inn $58+tax per night
Orbitz - Goodnite Inn Sylmar $57+tax
Travel Worm - Best Western Montebello Plaza - $59+tax

I will keep ya'll posted through e-mail and Live
Journal....so keep a look out!!!

Love you guys!!!!
MWAH......Carlita"

Ok it was like a secret fucking burried treasure. Among the old records were albums such as Fleetwood Mac, Devo, The Police, U2, prince, Johnny Cash, Led Zeplin, the Ramones, Stevie Wonder, the Motels, and so so so much more.

"event","So today I got into a wreck....to some of you you're pronanly thinkin 'so what else is new?' hehe well you would also think my mom of all ppl would think that also but of course life doesnt work out that way. Anyways on a lighter note New Years was fun except for the part when gen's parents came home. It was one of those surreal feelings when you're thinkin 'oh shit this cant be happening' but u know it really is and there isnt shit u can do about it......well thats how that night was. Luckily I don't think Gen got into a lot of trouble but it was amusing to be in the situation we were in. Oh and on saturday me, amanda, rebecca, mikael, stephanie, and barrera all went clubbin. We had went to surfshack at first but ashley didnt have her i.d. so we went to Wild West (a country music club). It was actually pretty cool. They did manage to squeeze in some booty music in so it wasnt all bad.....and i wish i knew how to dance to country cuz it looked like the country folk were havin a blast. But alas we met some awfully weird men....One of which hit on me and was like 'what do ya do' and i says to the guy i says 'ummm i;m in school' and in his drunken stupor says 'oooh would you'd be interested in some extracurricular activities' GAG!!!! hell no thank god Mikael, my long lost friend from 5th grade came and saved me, Thanks Mikael!!!!!!!!!!!!! But we met some other pretty civililzed, decent guys.....who bought us drinks. But there was one of these guys.....steve or chris sumthin or other.........who was the most absolute weirdest guy ive ever met....he seemed slow and claimed to be retarded...needles to say i believed him. It was a great night and hopefully there will be more to come. AHHHHHH so refrshing to write in my LJ....well until my next life changing event......ciao bella!!!"

Majority of the time Mikael was on the fone for a good while....and while she was out there I commented to Genevieve and Amanda that God had better be calling her!!! I dunno if it sounds funny now but it was funny at the time. And moving on....after starbux mikael, amanda, and i chilled at big pimps for a while and then headed on to the park to smoke (unfortunatley not the mota teehee) But anyways after that we all met up at Mikaels to watch BLOW a very exciting movie about the sweetest drug dealer, yes sweet and oh so sexy!!! At a certain part of the movie when johnny depp goes to jail he says: ""Jail was a school for crime. I went in with a Bachelors in marijuana and came out with doctors in cocaine."" Me and Amanda looked at eachother and were like in awe of possibly my new favorite quote. Anyways long story short.....blow was badass....afterwards we watched the Labrynth and it wasnt so badass as i remembered it to be, but still quite a movie!!

Lyrics to Tom's Diner (I promised amanda that i would figure out what they were)
I am sitting
In the morning
At the diner
On the corner


I am waiting
At the counter
For the man
To pour the coffee


And he fills it
Only halfway
And before
I even argue


He is looking
Out the window
At somebody
Coming in


""It is always
Nice to see you""
Says the man
Behind the counter


To the woman
Who has come in
She is shaking
Her umbrella


And I look
The other way
As they are kissing
Their hellos


I'm pretending
Not to see them
Instead
I pour the milk


I open
Up the paper
There's a story
Of an actor


Who had died
While he was drinking
It was no one
I had heard of


And I'm turning
To the horoscope
And looking
For the funnies


When I'm feeling
Someone watching me
And so
I raise my head


There's a woman
On the outside
Looking inside
Does she see me?


No she does not
Really see me
Cause she sees
Her own reflection


And I'm trying
Not to notice
That she's hitching
Up her skirt


And while she's
Straightening her stockings
Her hair
Is getting wet


Oh, this rain
It will continue
Through the morning
As I'm listening


To the bells
Of the cathedral
I am thinking
Of your voice...


And of the midnight picnic
Once upon a time
Before the rain began...


I finish up my coffee
It's time to catch the train"

Oh and before I forget....thanks Amanda for helping me on my english paper....yer freakishly good at those things!!! Ahhhh today was my last english class which was very satisfactory, i don't have to worry about another paper till jan 18 :) ladeeda well I'm off to my home to take a lil cat nap so smell ya later!!

MOM: So how r yer grades in school?
Me: OK i guess....i'm pretty consistent with B's and C's
MOM: Y not any A's?
Me: Mom, it's freakishly hard to make A's
MOM: So it's impossible
Me: No I need to try harder
MOM: R u sure u want to be going to school?
Me: *on the verge of tears and now yelling* Man i was doubting if i can make it myself now yer doubting  me!!!!
MOM: well i have my reasons!
Me: *still yelling* what the hell are they!?!?
MOM: I found yer pipe
Me: Oh

And then she threatens to stop paying for my school and taking my car away, but it didnt happen....and she said next time she finds it she's gonna yell at me...teehee
Oh yea....and so today I had to go to court for a ticket i got a long time ago....but i didn't go cuz it was too early (9am). Well the dude called me and was like ""i guess we're gonna have to reset the date""...thank God cuz i was like oh shit carlita's goin to the big house (Jail) but thankkfully i am not.....ahhhhh a sigh of relief....and that'll teach that lawyer to set an early court date!! And off to wal-mart i go....oh and i havent done this in a while....i leave u with sum words of wisdom:

It was the funniest thing and I smoked out of a hooka bong for the first time it was crazy shit i love experiencing new shit so it was quite enjoyable. Well I shall get b ack to watching the 3 hour long sasga of the Lord of the rings so until next time i leave you with this quote:

Principal: Mr. Madison, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul. 
-Billy Madison"

Been a hella day&mdash;a hella weekend, actually, with much more drama than I really needed or required this close to going on the first ever Court Jesters tour. I have the feeling the drama has just started, too. Probably just as well I will be on the road/out of the country.
<lj-cut>
<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">So, yesterday, yeah? Big Anniversary party for MDL Communications. 46</span><sup>th</sup><span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;""> year and all that. Swanky digs, the whole tux-and-fancy-dress thing. I represented the Jesters, since The Geek was spending the weekend in Cardiff with the wife and kids. (Mrs Geek doing </span><i style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Doctor Who </i><span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">again; just as easy to stay out there than to try to get home and back.) Took Shelby as my date&mdash;her first real grown-up affair. She had a mint green strapless princess gown and did her hair in ringlets. She looked quite grown-up and made me feel somewhat old. Mother was there, of course, as were Caro and Teague, the CJ PA Ian and his boy-o, Uncle Eddie and his wife, plus a large assortment of employees, including Becky and Simon Fucking Cooper. Even the Pirates put in an appearance.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Things went pretty much how you would expect them to go for the first part: cocktails and socializing, followed by dinner. After dinner, though, the shite hit the fan. As is Father&rsquo;s custom, he makes a speech while we&rsquo;re all enjoying dessert, thanking everyone for another good year and recognizing those who had achieved significant anniversaries with the company or were retiring or had been promoted. A slew of underlings received a 5-year recognition; my PA received his 10-year one (good Kroll, 10 years already!) along with some other people; went upwards and onwards from there. Only one retiree this year&mdash;a wizened old-sort named Ken Broughton who had been the overall accounting manager since before my voice changed. All sorts of praise, a lovely plaque, and a fancy Apple Watch landed in Ken&rsquo;s hands. Father then announced Ken&rsquo;s replacement. He went on about how several people could have had the position, and it was a hard choice, but the new overall accounting manager would be Amy Montageau.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Said Amy Montageau&mdash;a handsome lady somewhere in her 40s&mdash;gasped with delight. The other accountants sitting near her offered her congratulations and such. Everyone&rsquo;s attention fell onto that particular table&hellip; so no one missed Simon Fucking Cooper suddenly standing, pulling papers out of his tux pocket, handing said papers to his wife, and stalking off toward the bar.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Becky glanced at the papers&mdash;then shook her head and pulled them closer to her, to better read them. After a few moments she flung the papers down before fleeing the room. Naturally, we didn&rsquo;t know how to react. The DJ, though, put on some music, and soon enough, people were distracted by dancing.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">The papers remained at Becky&rsquo;s place. After a while, with no sign of Becky returning, Father drifted over to the table, picking up the papers and glancing over them. His expression darkened; he tucked the papers into his jacket pocket and beelined for the bar, where Simon Fucking Cooper had taken up permanent residence. Not wanting to miss the fight, I headed over there as well.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve some nerve, Cooper,&rdquo; Father growled. &ldquo;Serving your wife divorce papers in the middle of a company function.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Yeah, well, I&rsquo;m done with her. She wasn&rsquo;t able to get me the Honeybears account, she wasn&rsquo;t able to get me the head of accountancy position, she wasn&rsquo;t able to give me an heir. She&rsquo;s been a waste of time and attention the past 10 years. I&rsquo;m done with her.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Guess what? I&rsquo;m done with you.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fired.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t I? I may not run day-to-day operations any longer, but I&rsquo;m certainly the final say. And I say you&rsquo;re gone. You&rsquo;ve only had your job as long as you have because of Rebecca. And since you&rsquo;re not keeping her, there&rsquo;s no reason for MDL to keep you.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I at least get my things?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Any personal possessions will be left at the reception desk for you Monday morning. Unfortunately, you will not be able to retrieve any proprietary information either in print or in electronic form.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Father shrugged, then pulled out his iPhone. He tapped a few buttons on the screen before holding it up to make a call. &ldquo;Ah, Gunter, hello&mdash;yes, I know we&rsquo;re both at the same function. Too important to try to find you on the dance floor&hellip;. Simon Cooper&rsquo;s access to the building and the computer system is terminated immediately. Are you able to do the jiggery-pokery from here?... splendid. Sorry to bother you and enjoy the rest of the event.&rdquo; He hung up and tucked his iPhone away. He then glared at Simon Fucking Cooper, an eyebrow raised in challenge.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fucking sue.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Try it. You won&rsquo;t succeed. Your personnel file will speak for itself. Now, you&rsquo;d best leave before I have you thrown out. This event is for employees and clients only.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Simon Fucking Cooper threw his drink in Father&rsquo;s face and stomped out of the room.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Father pulled a handkerchief out and wiped his face. &ldquo;Well, that could have been worse.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;What a fucktard,&rdquo; I commented. &ldquo;To do that to Becky in public, at a company function&hellip;.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Somehow I&rsquo;m not surprised. He&rsquo;s been brown-nosing it for years. And I&rsquo;ve always suspected he married Rebecca for her connections to me. She seemed to like him well enough, so&hellip;.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Next time I see him, I will deep fry his balls.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope it doesn&rsquo;t come to that. You&rsquo;ve kept your nose clean for a dozen years, Colin; I&rsquo;d hate for him to ruin the streak.&rdquo; He signaled the bartender for a large bourbon on the rocks.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">I wandered off then, to see if I could spot Becky in amongst the surging bodies on the dance floor. I saw no sign of her, so I asked Caro and several of the accounting ladies to keep an eye open for her. I then hit the dance floor to give all sorts of employees (mostly female but several males as well) a thrill with dancing with a Court Jester.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Tell the truth, I lost track of time, and track of what was up with Becky. It wasn&rsquo;t until Shelby came running up to me that I even thought of things other than keeping people happy on the dance floor. &ldquo;Dad-zor!&rdquo; she exclaimed, skidding into me because of her shoes. &ldquo;Miss Plumb&rsquo;s holed up in the handicapped stall, freaking out. No one can get her out!&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;What makes you think I can?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, you can calm me down when I&rsquo;m freaking, maybe you can do the same for her. It would be worth a try, at least! Ms. Southwick says she&rsquo;s been at it forever.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;All right--&nbsp; you&rsquo;ve talked me into it.&rdquo; I offered Shelby my arm; she took it, preening a bit at the admiring looks we received as we headed for the washroom. Once in front of the door, I sent her in to make sure no other woman was inside, then set her to guard duty while I entered.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Becky&rsquo;s sobs permeated the room. Trying to stay chipper, I planted myself in front of the door to the handicapped stall. &ldquo;Becky, darling, what&rsquo;s all this, then? Is that wanker really worth your tears?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">The sobs stopped; the door flung open and Becky launched herself into my arms. &ldquo;Oh, Colin, it&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not, darling, but it&rsquo;s also not fair for you to camp out in the washroom when so many others could avail themselves of the handicapped stall. Come back to the party with me?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s the best.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">We returned to the party. Becky headed for her table, blanching when the divorce papers weren&rsquo;t there. &ldquo;Father has them,&rdquo; I murmured. &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t going any place but to a barrister recommended by our legal team. You&rsquo;re so much more important than </span><i style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">he </i><span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">is. MDL will take care of you.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Thanks, Colin.&rdquo; She sat, tucking a stray hair behind her ear. I chose the seat to her right, leaning toward her so she could better hear me. &ldquo;Did you have any clue this was coming?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;No. Yes. Perhaps. I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;All right, fair enough. He&rsquo;s always been a bit of a creeper. The way he hit on &lsquo;Colleen&rsquo; and all&hellip;.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s always looked at other women. I figured it came with the territory. Doesn&rsquo;t every man window shop, even if they have one at home?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">I shrugged. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve never had one at home.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">She stroked my chin then. &ldquo;Pity.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Oh, and how much have you had to drink, Miss Plumb?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Not enough. I&rsquo;m still shell shocked and hurting from being served papers.&rdquo; She made a face then, glancing down at her wrist. She wore an Apple Watch; she poked at the screen, reading it before blanching. &ldquo;The bastard,&rdquo; she hissed.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">She showed me the screen. Simon Fucking Cooper had sent her a text noting that he was tossing all of her belongings on the lawn and she had best claim them prior to the neighborhood scrounging for them.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;All right, then. We are calmly going to recruit helpers and find some trashbags, and then we&rsquo;re going to go over there and claim your belongings, and then find you some place to stay tonight. I&rsquo;ll go alert Father&hellip;&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Oh, no, don&rsquo;t involve Sir Michael! He thinks so poorly of me.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;He does not. He handed your soon-to-be-ex his arse on a plate.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;He fired him, and revoked his building and computer access in front of him.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Oh my!&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been his right hand for 10 years, darling, how could he </span><i style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">not </i><span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">have your back?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">She blushed at that. I took her hand, made her stand, and said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call in the possie.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">I pulled her around the room, talking to Teague, Caro, Father, Mother, Uncle Eddie, Ian and his boy-o and Shelby, cluing them in that we needed to get to Shepard&rsquo;s Bush asap to retrieve Becky&rsquo;s things. We found large garbage bags in the kitchen. Ignoring our finery, we hopped into several cars and sped for the northwest part of town.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Sure enough, the front lawn of their detached home bore the contents of Becky&rsquo;s closets and drawers. Using our smart phones as torches, we all gathered up as much as we could, as quietly as we could. Simon Fucking Cooper spotted us eventually and threatened to call the authorities. Father and I gave him the up-yours in unison. He continued to hang out of an upper storey window hurling abuse.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Once the yard had been fairly cleaned up, I looked up at him. &ldquo;Is that all of Becky&rsquo;s things, you wanker?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;The jewellery is mine.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Not my mother&rsquo;s engagement ring!&rdquo; Becky yelled.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Most especially that, because it&rsquo;s the only thing of yours that&rsquo;s worth anything.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;You creep!&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;You barren, no good cunt!&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Father placed a consoling arm around Becky then. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get it back in the trial, don&rsquo;t you worry about that. Now, you need a place to stay tonight. We have room at our place&hellip;.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Oh, goodness, Sir Michael, I couldn&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Shelby piped up with, &ldquo;You can hang with Dad-zor and me. We&rsquo;ve an extra room. If that&rsquo;s more comfortable, that is.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Becky met my gaze. &ldquo;If you wouldn&rsquo;t mind, Col&hellip;?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">I shrugged. &ldquo;No worries. Wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">We loaded my car up with as many bags as it could hold; the rest went into Father&rsquo;s car. Everyone else waved and drove off. My parents followed me and Shelby and Becky back to Ealing and my home. It took few minutes to unload everything into my lounge. My parents hugged both Shelby and myself, took Becky&rsquo;s hand for a moment, and presumably returned to the party.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I suggest pajamas and hot chocolate all around.&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;With perhaps something a little stronger?&rdquo; Becky added hopefully.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;For you, yes. Shelbs, would you show Becky the guest room and bath?&rdquo;</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">&ldquo;Sure, Dad-zor. It&rsquo;s just this way&hellip;&rdquo; Shelby led Becky up the stairs. I collapsed on the sofa, loosening my bowtie. What a strange, frustrating evening.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Little did I know things would get worse.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">And yeah, leaving it on that cliffhanger because I need my beauty sleep and fuck me but I have to deal with all sorts of final pre-tour meetings tomorrow. </span>

"event","Simon Fucking Cooper used the annual MDL Anniversary party to serve Becks w/ divorce papers. In public. Because he's an asshole and didn't get the promotion he thought he deserved and because Becks never provided him with an heir. Needless to say, Father handed him his arse on a plate (with a minimal severance package, probably  more than he deserved).

It gets real interesting 'cause Becks wants a pity party today (sunday) and wants Colleen there. And that's awkward since I'm about to go on a 6 week tour of the UK and US as boyish me.

Still, I see Simon Fucking Cooper again, and I'm deep-frying his balls while he's still attached to them. You don't DO THAT to yer wife of nearly 10 years, not in public, and not at a company function."

"event","Oh, I have been so <em>schtum</em> on things on my usual social media sources (twitter, Facebook page, official blog) it isn't funny. But, since this journal is fairly locked down, I can indulge in a bit of whinging.

It should be obvious: I desperately want to be the next Doctor. Given my rather advanced age (43 next month), this regeneration will probably be my last, best hope. I have known for several years that the Moff doesn't think much of me-- oh, he hasn't said as much to my face, but The Geek made it clear, once HE got hired as the Official Music Man of the show. Yes, I've been an obnoxious fuck in the past-- but I've gotten better. Honestly! Since the announcement of Matt Smith as the Doctor, I have been nothing but discrete. Even our CJ musical parody of DW met w/ Moff's approval (I let the Geek handle that one of course.) I've been nothing but the soul of discretion.

Still, I can't help but wonder....

a) am I too well-known? I mean, really, not a BIG name, but still, people know who I am.

b) The whole Shardnay/Merlow etc. thing might be a hindrance-- not exactly family-friendly, you know?

c) Could my personal life-- specifically the big fuck-up 10 years ago (FUCK! TEN YEARS AGO!)-- keep me from being cast?

Needless to say, am totally playing by the rules. I used my new casting agent (who I retained some 6 months ago, thank you) to submit CV, reel, etc. I have said absolutely nothing in social media, didn't even acknowledge that my odds are 25/1 (same as Euuuuuuuuuu's!) I'm praying (well, not exactly, but begging whatever powers are in charge) that I get to at least audition. I want to be able to show my mad skillz and my Doctor ability off properly, and then be judged on my performance, not my baggage.

If I had known DW would get a reboot, I wouldn't have fucked up so badly 10 yrs ago. No T, no shade."

Yanno, once yer a certain age, ya hafta give the most screen time to young, unknown (but rilly ghetto) dancer and poseur types.

<ul>
<li>Second-generation <i>Doctor Who</i> fan-- understand what the legacy means and how to treat it.
<li>No stranger to controversy, press attention, and long working hours.
<li>Offers 'name recognition' factor.
<li>Versatile actor who can either posh it up or chav it up, depending on production team desires.
<li>Equally authoritative in a frock coat and a leather jacket.
<li>Taller than McCoy and Troughton; approximately same height as McGann.
<li> Have built-in estrogen brigade (apparently).
<li>Sexy beast who appeals to the gay anorak fanbase as well as the frumpy pre-menopausal fanbase.
<li>Can accommodate the production team on the couch, should the need arise.

So, yeah, I was a Geek for the day, and he was a Randyjester. (Won't let me post the photo of him, though, the bastard.) We had some fun w/ it, mostly 'cause we spent the afternoon making fun of each other. (Easy for me to do his voice-- didn't realise that he could do mine!) Nothing earth shattering, really.

Mads was aged, too, although aged more than me, so I spent the afternoon referring to her as 'mother' and tending to her every need. Was fun, but also fucking scary to see m'self looking like an older man.

"event","First, must wish a happy birthday to my Auntie J, who does not look or act like she's sixty-one today. Hope you had a great day, Auntie, and that Uncle Ego wasn't too much of a pain in the arse.

Right. Now. So, what many of you want to know: wot the meeting was like about the next Heyer piece. 

Interesting, it was. Only thing really concluded was that <i>Regency Buck</i> will be the next book filuuuuumed. Both the Suits and the Production Team could see me in any of the three main male roles (Pereguine, Bernard, Julian)-- and to tell truth, so can I! So, they're gonna do a casting call, see who turns up, and assign me a part based on who else they have to work w/.

Am fracking chuffed that I have an automatic 'in.'

More interesting: Writer-type (that wd. be AMZ, for those of you keeping score at home) approached me afters, wanting to talk to me about a different project. (He said it wuz a-ok to mention it <i>dans le publique,</i> so it's not like I'm spoiling things.) Repaired to a nearby pub, we did, where he laid the details on me.

Seems that after <i>Regency Buck,</i> he's gonna go for his 1st Series Creation gig. He's already got a spot in fall/winter 2005-6 reserved on 4, on the strength of his scripting of <i>A Quiet Gentleman</i> and <i>The Foundling.</i> He wants me as the lead. Leads, really, 'cause he's thinking the series will involve twins somehow. (Twins, Basil, twins!) Assured him, I did, that I was all about it, if the pilot script was as good as his adaptations are. He anticipates having the script together sometime in June, since he now needs to spew forth more Heyer in the next sev. wks. 'Glad you're interested, Colin,' he said as we parted. 'Couldn't imagine doing it w/o you.'

Am dead chuffed, I am, at that. Never had anyone <b>good</b> want to build a project around me. (Well, other than Saunders and the rest of his Heyer crew-- but that was only after I proved to be both good and good ratings in the first one.) (Less said about that tv-movie-of-the-wk that was s'posed to be a pilot and bombed so badly there's a landmine campaign against its continued existence, the better. My excuse: was in middle of m' macho-shithead-all-drugs-all-the-time phase. Still, Father <b>did</b> say not to sign on the ol' dotted and I blithely ignored him. Stupid, stupid, stupid in retrospect.)

Right. So anyway, spent rest of day hangin' w/ m' homegirl (Shelby, duh!), and now that she's asleep and I've had my nightcap w/ Father, and I'm done here for now, am going off to review scenes for auditions tomorrow. Am keeping bizzy, yay! A bored Colin is a Colin likely to get into trouble."

"event","Gave good voice reel today, I did. Can't talk worth frack currently, though. Hope voice will return enough by tomorrow to argue points of which Heyer Hero I shd be next. Think good thoughts for me tomorrow, darlings, so that I end up in the role <b>you</b> want me to play!

In the meantime, time to have another pot of honeyed-lemon tea before bed."

after days in the sun and sundays in the sheets
to drive away from me just one last time,
Please say its the last time.

What secrets will we not even tell ourselves?
like, 'I love you'
on the tips of nervous tongues 
sounds like ""Come Back"" instead.

Timing is a tricky thing,
the two of us seeking out supplies we might need to make a life
different directions that always end up as circles
back to you and me.

So, don't worry darlin
its always 'just for now'
I'll see you on the other side of us."

I would drive my car out of gas on the loneliest of country roads for you? 
In the middle of the night, and I wouldn't mind
But no amount of gas would get me to where you are, 
you're always too far away.

I steel away into the night anyway, 
without you is no loss
I kidnap the first thing with a heartbeat I can find 
and we run away together
laughing, 
taking pictures,
and finally enjoying the fall."

love's a ship not built to sail
so this boat sank, 
quite naturally.

It dove into the depths with a smile on its face, singing old sailor's songs 
the ones named after pretty lovers, left behind in haunted ports
The captain never shed a tear, but combed her hair and smoothed out her clothes
after all, she'd been waiting for this

Yes, it sank.
It had to.
It was either that or be anchored.
 
but a strong and unwaivering heat,
the kind that makes two people sticky with each other
the kind of stick that makes you too lazy to move, 
so you stay, smile, and feel it forever

I'm learning to differentiate subjective from objective theories of welfare.

A pro-attitude towards the things that constitute my prudential mesurments of value might be necessary, but is it sufficient?
If the answer is yes then certain risky behaviours would have to be condoned. Pedaphilia, drug use, crime, and horrible spelling, we'd have to grant that these things actually do contribute to an individual's well being, soley on the grounds that the person experiences a positive inclination towards them. 
If the answer is no, then my individual judgements of value, whether I believe a thing to be good for me, or to add to the value of my life, are inconsequential. In practice (if we subscribe to objective welfare theory) we would be forced to allow personal agency, liberty, and autonomy to become obsolete in practical ethics and notions of welfare. It would not matter what the individual decides is valueble, which actions a person thinks would be best for them, or make them happy because what they SHOULD, OUGHT, or MUST do has nothing to do with them at all. Here, pure paternalism would rule.
I'm not comfortable with either, however there are people (apparently smarter than I), who claim that there is no third option. That the categories of subjective and objective, along with the unadulterated consequences of each, are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. 
Not quite. In my expeirience if you're attempting to discern coherence with a set of criteria that produces only two potentialities, and neither is very salient on a practical level, it is likely that it's the method, and not its notions, are incorrect."

I am still here, just swamped. I'm sorry to every single friend I am neglecting while playing a mad-dash catch up just in time to write three essays and study for two exams in just shy of 13 days, while sorting through an ex's mind games....and ripping him a new asshole in self defence.
 Ah, at some point next week I will exhail again. I hope.

Proud parent of a puppy
Scarred, more new tattoos by the day, it seems
Feeling very fucking hot lately, and alittle cocky.
partying with new people, in old hang out spots.
Thats all."

"event","I got a lip tattoo, don't tell my family.
I got a puppy, don't tell my cat.
I got a vagina-boner from one of your friends, and I don't plan on telling ANYONE.
I got a shitload of homework, but my brain won't listen.

I gotta get back to work, don't tell my boss...."

"event","I have a lot of things to write about but not enough emotional energy to do it.
If I had the motivation I would write about:
admitting when it's over
how my younger brother recently aquired his first house at 21, and I resent him for it
how disconnected from my parents I have become
how I may/or may not be depressed
how I have let my school work suffer in vain
my new tattoos.

but I don't so I won't."

"event","Picture this: 
Dead Faces vynal (Okkervil River) playing on the stereo because the banjo solo gives me goose bumps.
And it's raining.
And I know you're comming back today, no longer provinces away from me.
And I know you're around the corner, cause I can feel you from here, 
breathing. sleeping.
And I know you'll be commin' around here anytime now, so I'm reading horoscopes and hoping they can tell me what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna bake lots of things for no one, 
I'm gonna fill my space with lovely music and read some words by those better trained than me

Anything to try to forget that its you're comming
and that there are loose ends to tie."

"event","Have love matters been causing you excessive strain for a while now, dear Sagittarius? If so, you can expect that to end now. Someone you love very deeply reciprocates your feelings, and if there are differences between you, is very anxious to resolve them and look towards the future. This relationship will probably succeed - IF you go in with eyes wide open. Don't have unrealistic expectations of your partner. Learn to love human flaws as much as perfections."

However - if for some reason you have the burning desire to get inside my head, and read the gossip, drama, and other boring events of my life, by all means, drop a comment."

I answered the questions <lj user=""abiona_sashenka""> sent me.  However, because i check my journal at work, and I am paranoid that someone at work might see it, i put it to friends only.  If you are just ripe with curiosity, and want to read it, let me know and I will add you to my friends list....."

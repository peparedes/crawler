I was in a good mood, until I got home.
But it is in the back of my mind 
that I havent been this happy since 
the end of 8th grade.
STOP THUNDERING I WANT TO GO RUNNING.!!

I want to play Elafun and Cootie.
Not sure about the whole camping thing this weekend due to the hurricane.
It's offical, I have no upper-body strength whatsoever
I should have stayed for the boys freshman soccer game. It's a lot better than sitting here.
But then again it's pouring so they're probably not even playing.
Some creepy black upperclassmen at my lunch table told me their boy wanted to holla at me. I told them I didn't holla and they asked what I did do and I said nothing. They wouldnt leave me alone and tried to get me to smell a book and throw away their trash.
Homecoming...::sigh:: I'm in love.

Last night I went over to AllieZ's to party with the Logan girls, and Theresa. Boy talk with Tony, dancing, football, lifting allie, creepy kid following me, allie falling in the yard, JEREMY!!!!!, dancing in the truck with tony, light as a feather stiff as a board, Jason laughing every time, brian. jason. and bobby scaring us, the mask in the bushes, the door not staying shut on the camper, me waking up to tampon talk, obsessing over Oliver James, Twister when allies mom came home.

good times. good times.
Camping with Nesbit friday-sunday.
Camping 25-26th? If I can get down there.
I'm going to take a shower. I accidentiaclly (sp?) slept with Allie's dogs blanket and now I smell.

Went to the Borgata for Meatloaf. Talking about Easy Bake Ovens and me thinking that ice cream was ravioli and then that made me want dip 'n dots. No one would stand up and my cousin and I were getting mad. Eventually everyone did. It was a good show. Kelly and I went up to the front. Had a confetie fight after the concert. She put it down my shirt and pants. Some guy tapped me on the shoulder and said ""Excuse me, do you know you have confetti down your pants?""  it was hillarous.
Mom and Dad decided not to sleep down the shore. Came home and now, am home and very tired."

<small>If my family was ever like the family on 7th Heaven I'd shoot myself.
Had a nice talk with Ashley today :)
Not in the greatest of moods though.
I think I'm going down the shore one day this weekend 'til Tuesday.
I am extremly tired
Hardcore shopping tomorrow, even though I dislike shopping.
I want to straighten my hair, yet don't have the energy to.

THINGS I'VE REALIZED ABOUT MYSELF
I'm horrible at calling people back.
I'm always tired.
I eat a lot.
I don't think.
I regret a lot of things."

"event","<small>Virginia was so much fun.
Saturday-Woke up at 5 AM and to start my day off I got to talk to Brian before I left :) so my cousins and what not get here, we leave, the ride there was dumb, Christa and I slept and blah blah. We got there about 1ish, I think and then a little later Christa, Melissa, Bobby and I went swimming in the river since the Jackson river in in my grandpops backyard. Went to the swinging bridge after dinner. Didn't do much since it was our first day there. WEnt to bed before 11:30.

Sunday-Woke up at like 9. After sitting around for a while we all went to the waterfall which is like 15 minutes away from my grandpops house. We climbed down the side of the mountain which was, interesting, and then went under the waterfall which was so cool. Climbed back up then went to the top of the falls which was crazyyy. After that we went to uh some place and then we went to Humback Bride. Christa, Melissa and I all signed the bridge 'cause it's one of those things that everyone signs. Played in the water for a little bit then went to WAL MART where we saw our dose of normal people for the 4 days we were there. After that we went back to the house and then my dad, aunt collene, christa, melissa, bobby and I all went tubing. We drove 5 minutes away and it took us like 30 minutes to get back to my grandpops house, it was a lot of fun. Christa and I swam in the river for a little bit then went back and took naps til dinner time. When it got dark we all went down near the river and had a bonfire. It's amazing how many stars you can see there. Christa and I scared the crap out of Bobby and Melissa which was the funniest thing ever. Just laughed at dumb stuff while trying to sleep. 

Monday- Woke up to Bobby and Melissa letting the air out of Christa and I's air matress in their efforts to get us back for scaring them. Watched My Best Friends WEdding then went to the lake. Hardcore swimming and lying in the tubes until I saw fish and got freaked out. Layed out and got semi-tan. Took showers in the very nice bathhouses and then went back to the house. Sat around, packed up some stuff, blah blah yeah.

Today-Woke up at 7, left at 8. Stopped at the Cracker Barrel somewhere in VA for brunch. Beat Christa in checkers, played some game thinger, ate some eggs and bacon then back on the road. Stopped a few times and got home atound 3:45.

"event","<small><center>When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
We've been through this auch a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
An no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time
To lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time... on your own
Do you need some time... all alone
Everybody needs some time...
On their own
Don't you know you need some time... all alone
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you
Sometimes I need some time... on my
Own
Sometimes I need some time... all alone
Everybody needs some time...
On their own
Don't you know you need some time... all alone
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one"

Last night my sister was in the kitchen showing Aaron what she had bought at the mall. My mom and I were already in the kitchen when my dad walks in. Now let me tell you this, my sister is a compulsive shoper and my dad is always telling her to spend the money on something else. So he's looking at what she bought and then he says to my mom <b>""We should have gotten 3 more dogs instead of having kids""</b>
Then my mom replys with ""I tried to tell you no...""
Thats where my sister and I made them end the convorsation.

"event","<small>well, was on the phone with Brian until 5:22 this morning.
Slept until 1:30.
Yes, I rock due to this.
I love how my brother makes up dumb names so he can get a free CCS.
Bandon O Brown. What kind of name is that?
Wow I'm tired.
I also want pizza.
Caitlyn and I have this new found obsession with country music.
Well it's not actually ""new found"" becauusee I've always listened to country.

"event","<small>MY BROTHER HID EMPIRE RECORDS FROM ME BECAUSE HE SAID I WATCH IT TOO MUCH >O
Watched Maid In Manhattan. It was dumb. Don't watch it.
Resces Peices made me feel sick. 
I want to move.
I hate my neighborhood.
If I did move I'd want to stay in West Deptford, though.
Because I love way too many people here <33333
But damnit mom and dad said when they do decide to ever move, it wont be back in WD.
Dad says it'll be somewhere where your nearest neighbor is a mile away and you can get away with walking around your yard naked.
You know the spot like on the inside of your arm where your elbow bends?
well if I touch that on me or my hair is touching it, it makes me feel like I cant breathe and makes me feel sick. hmm. Wow I'm odd.

Jeremiah was a bullfrog was a good friend of mine I never nderstood a single word he said but I helped him drink his wineb and he always had some mighty fine wine singin'...Joy to the world all the boys and girls now joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea joy to you and me
if I were the king of the world tell you what I'd do I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the war make sweet love to you

<P>Friday night I went out with Hesling,<FONT color=#ff6666> I love her by the way</FONT>, and we went to Twin Lake.&nbsp; Her and I were good children, well she was anyways.&nbsp; I was surprised to see some boys fighting in the dirt and some kids I havn't seen in a few weeks.&nbsp; Of course the whole mocking Kaily about cabin weekend continued, and although I am getting tired of it, some of the things are funny.&nbsp; Megan and I were getting bored so she went and got her country CD and we put it in Hoppe's car and Meg taught me some line dance moves...we are deffinetly going to have to go kick it some time........So <FONT color=#66ff99>Kendra, Staci, Miranda and Kayleigh </FONT>decided they were going to camp out friday night and while they were gone we had a <FONT color=#3366ff>flood warning </FONT>( haha )&nbsp; and Zillka placed their tent on Hoppe's roof...he was just looking out for the girls of course.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meg and I decided to leave after our fun-filled evening....then I was awoken by my damn alarm Saturday morning about 7:30......Becky was on her way to get me, and we had this fun tubbing trip planned.</P>
<P>So we get to Jackie's about 8:35ish and must I state we were <FONT color=#ffcc00 size=4>EARLY</FONT>...and if anyone knows Becky she is <FONT color=#000000 size=4>NEVER </FONT>early......Finally Cait and Goreschy showed up and we jumped in the cool ass truck.&nbsp; We went and met Sharon and Jackie's mom then to get the tubes.....so we had to fill up our own tubes, well the lady told us the hose was outside, must I say all of us, that would be 7 people, walked around the building not to find the hose.&nbsp; Thank god we got it all figured out and we were on our way.</P>
<P>Our tubbing trip was soo much fun and we all plan to do it again and SOON..everyone should go it was a blast...espically when Jackie got attacked by those trees.&nbsp; I""m sorry, I saved your tube though hehe....I would just like to inform everyone I was the only person <FONT color=#33cc00>NOT </FONT>to get burnt&nbsp; and <FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>Sarah Goresch wins the medal for the most COLOR </FONT>haah...shes got skill.&nbsp; I <FONT color=#9999ff>LOVE </FONT>all you girls and we are gunna hang out more !!</P>
<P>Later on we all needed a nap since we were so tired.&nbsp; Then we all partied our way down to GH for the Coast Guard Festivle, fun times I must say...I also enjoyed meeting Goreschy's friend Stephaine and seeing Karl and Matt woah yeah haha....I must say we walked out hinney's off, but it was so much fun and seeing that couple get engaged on the pier...SO AWESOME</P>
<P>Last night was a long one, now just relaxing andI am excited to finally make my apt for my road test...<FONT color=#993399>EXCITING</FONT>....I must also inform you all of my visit with <FONT color=#6600cc>Heather Harp </FONT>at sam's today, fun times we had a nice little chat and <FONT color=#6600cc>I hope to see her this weekend</FONT>!...oh and by the way practiced paralle (?) parking, I must say I am a <FONT color=#cc66cc>NATURAL</FONT>...I will talk to you all later.......byes!</P>"

here is where the excitement begins!...

Lysaa needed gas so she pulled into the spot and hit the black pole and scratched her car up! ouch! haha  then to top it off she locked her keys in her car! YEES!!  we went and got her spare keys then ended up getting chinese..how good!

After chinese we went to the mall to find exciting things to do, and then the night grew short and it was time for everyone to get home, so Jen and I were pulling out of the parking spot and Jen HIT a CAR! OMg....from all that fun Jen and Pete came over and we all just chilled where I forgot about the noddles I was making for my mom for chicken noddle soup.

But in turn they were fine and I guess the soup was good too!
          Now TODAY!....

LONGEST DAY OF MY LIFE!!!!

Becky and I walked to BK and got a little bite to eat before the fun solo auditions today....then with about 45 mintues til we walked back to the high school, as neither of us have ours licenses, and hung out with some peeps before auditions.....THEN THEY STARTED...

    The nerve racking experience started with Siahumba??...who knows how to spell that and for Becky and I ended with True Light....by the way LOGAN ROCKED MY WORLD IN THAT SONG!!....and today I found out Becky has one of the goregous voices ever...I LOVE YOU GIRLIE!!.... I have been hanging out at home kind of cold and crampish.  I went and got my passport pictures taken and I am SOOO READY FOR BRAZIL, right guys?!  YES!      I have been trying to call Branden to talk but he is cool and isin't at home...tear, tear..

oh and before I go and let you little kiddies go off to bed, I have one fun thing to say.....Today in English class I played Mrs. Hepherd and I was pregnant...oh yes and can't forget about Sarah playing Mr. Flash!  who doesn't like checking out men and who likes to talk about cocks....need info please just ask!

Lyss Rach and I went to Kay's house saturday night, I didnt really want to but I didnt want to stay home so why not right?...it wasn't that bad I just cant be around her and Brett anymore, its as if we all dont get along....with, understandable, there are some things you gotta find a way to work out...

So my phone has been acting all weird all weekend and when Lyss dropped me off saturday night my mom called like 9 times and everytime I picked up the phone no one was there...she said it was busy..nope...well its been doing thie constently and I am tired of it...Lyss and Rach said their phone has been doing it too..fun stuff

So yesterday was Halloween and everyone had this huge plan of doing stuff ya know going to the haunt, or even just going trick or treating...well again I got shafted...I am getting tired of it, you know how bad it makes you feel when your FRIENDS blow you off not just once like a lot...I mean ya know one time, maybe two thats alrigth but when you get to get high up there it hurts, I mean they are your friends right?...so I guess moving to another school is a good thing, obviously no one would care....and then to brag and talk about how much fun you had that makes a person feel even better..

well I need to go and do a paper for english...."

I hate living at home everyone is always yelling at each other and pissed off and no one is happy.  I hate it!  I am medically depressed, I try to come to school hapy and show like I am happy but it isint workin anymore and I feel bad bc I am mean to people when i dont mean to be and it just happens...sorry to those who I am mean too

There is this kid in my Driver's training class, oh yeah that has taken over my life the past 3 weeks I get my permit on thursday tho!  Thank god, and he has a crush on me he goes to muskeong nad I love the kid he is so funny and damn he cracks me up  that was the thing that kept me sane....I will miss him thank god we are trading numbers then I can just call him up. 

I hate how everything at school is so political, ok maybe I do suck at singing and I am just too stubborn to realize it, but pretty cool for lawton to say that allegros is amazing and pretty much saying that if you didnt make it you suck and your not amazing nad everyone flaunting it in 2nd hour YEAH go Kails for not making it mabe next year, as everyone says.. when I have gotten call backs every year and still nothing has changed

I have been talking to my mom about leaving shores I get so depressed when I go to schol and I dont know if leaving will help, I dont know where I would go maybe muskegon or catholic (SICK!) but we still need to finish our conversation.  I am just fed up with everything/ everyone I dont really want to get into it right now.  Well I am feeling sick again and I might have the same problem my mom had b/c my stomach is acting the same way and it hurts and its scary!  

I have been keeping myself busy with some fun people tho like Derek I had a nice long conversation with him saturady night and if felt so good to talk to someone, I miss him so much I am sad I dont see him as much anymore I told him we had to work on that and we are going to try and see each other every week/weekend!  I LOVE him he is my favorite brother!  

Well Amanda needs the computer and I need some sleep so I will talk to you all later and if you have any advice please give it to me straight I can take it, hopefully!"

  Just to fill you all in I have been without a computer ALL SUMMER, not like I needed it anyways but yeah.  So we just got a brand new one thats sooooo SEXY!

  It's been about a month since I have been on here and well, a lot has changed.  The James thing was a lot of fun and all ya know a summer fling I guess but now more to come!
   
   So my sister hooked up with this guy from G.R. who is one of the nicest people I have met in my life! Her and I went to G.R. to see a movie and he introduced me to his frined Veli (pronounced Valley) and he is the funniest person I have ever met.  well him and I hooked up kinda we kissed, and the funny thing was he bit my lip and it started bleeding but that was the second time I saw him.  See we and my firend Jessica went back to G.R. as Veli's parents were out of town and we had a fun party as his house.  Nothing bad of course I PROMISE!  Well, Veli and I like being friends better then anything else, which is for the best and his friend Rigo liked me a lot, so all the guys got us talking and hanging out and we have been hanging out forever now.

   He is from Armenia and is a sweetie.  He got me by telling me I have pretty eyes in Armenian.  Last weekend he took me out to dinner and we watched movies and I got to meet his best friend and hisbest friend's girlfriend.  You all can see pictures of him and all the guys once I get them developed.  I know you all are excited!  I am seeing him tomorrow too I am excited, he is coming to Muskegon and some of you might be able to meet him actualy!

  There prolly is more stuff but the boys from Albania and Armenia are the highlight of my summer!  I am going to go now and get chinese food with my sister and wrap presents for my moms birthday  (september 5th!) 

     Love you all,     Kaily!"

"event","woah so my computer is broken and I havn't been able to be on here FOREER!  I stole the laptop to take a break out of my day.  Too much has been going on lets just say I love summer and this is one of the best ones yet!

I have been with Lyss, Jenni, Alex, Pete, Tom and James almost every ngith.  I love James, oh yeah by the way did I mention we're dating now!!  and so is Jenni and Pete and Lyss and Alex...woa its out whole ""That '70's Show"" all in one...yeah Jen, your dona!

My life has been turning around latly, I am soo happy, well most of the time and when I am with James he makes me laugh..just like how there is too much traffic at 11:30 p.m. on forest park road. I will remember to use that line with my parents too, but on Eugene of course!   we have to have our little party again and this time Alex can come into the tent with us..right lyss?

My new interesting are coming out this summer SKIM BOARDING!  I was soo scared to try it but James got me to and thank god he did, its soo fun!  We also went fishing the other night and I caught a catfish and he caught some Jap. fish that we had to kill, becasue it eats fish eggs and such, so james and Andrew thought they wouldjust throw it in the boat to sufficate, I felt bad so James cut him in 1/2...oh no!  poor guy R.I.P.

If I havn't been at the Studeman's I have been at the beach, or Jenni's house.....those bugs are such perverts huh tom? oh yeah nad Jen...ASS!   I would really like a fuzzy navel and one more thing, his scare looks like a gun shot wound!<-- James you are special haha

Let's just say I have tried to change my ways, but I have to stick tothem, its what makes me, me!  and I love corrupting people (wink, wink)  I was going to take Tom on a little BK run with me but when I called to talk to James, he wasn't home so poor Tom coudln't come! Jenni left today for virgina and I am waiting to see if my parents will stay out of town so I can have a party.....looks kinda like it!

well, I dont know when I will be able to update again but I figured I had to inform you all just a little about my life.  Going pretty good and oh yeah, making out in a tent?...hmmm, everyone you should try it sometime, just be careful for the spiders.    
                  Much love,
                      ~Kails~"

"event","so today I had my wonderful doctor's apt. with my hemotoligist..blood doctor.  I had to get all this blood drawn and then on top of it take this medication that makes me SICK     I am still sck right now and I hate feeling like this.  I totaly realized tongith that my life is changing and I can't change anything!  I don't know what I am going to do and I need a lot of help...Billy is leaving in like 1 month and he is like a brother I wont see him for a year and NOOO I dont know what I will do.  Robert is going off to college, he has been the person who I can count on cheering me up, and I wont have that soon..and in a year my sister will be gone.. I don't have that much time with her....a few friends couldn't tell me the truth and that hurts the most.....Friends are suppose to be there for you when things go wrong, not make things go wrong I just don't want to sounds jealous, so I will keep it to myself.  My parents wont stop fighting nad I need to get out of this place I need to escape maybe leave for a little while, that would work and sadly, one more thing a person who ithought was totaly out of my life just stepped back into it.  I thought I would be fine with it, but I am not...he means too much to me to just sit here and let him pass me by...he could be the one I need to make me happy, he always made me happy and I want to go back to that again....I will sleep on it and please someone help me I don't know what to do!  sweet dreams, Kaily"

"event","hello World!  so last night was Prom and it was the greatest night ever!  I had so much fun with Robert, Andrew, and Julia.  I have to hang out with them again as they are awesome...oh yeah boys so who beat you in euker??...uh mh JULIA AND I!  So before the dance my parents thoiught it would be cool if we have a ""family Photo session"" we took about 20 pictures and  i was about ready to DIE...bye the time Robert got to my house I was ready to get out...We were going to be early to his house so we went and checked on the lake..it was good.  when we returned got all the pretty pictures or all of us and saw twining's HOT  MUSTANG..oh man sorry, but I would leave any date for that thing.  While waiting for Julia to arrive we plaed a little ""HORSE"" and by the way..Kaily did KICK Robert's butt...finally it was time for the dance to ""BOGGIE DOWN""  to  make a long night short..Robert was being mean so Decker straightened him up and after that he was such a SWEETHEART  I think it was because of me and not Decker..haha...My feet were hurting so bad, not just because of my shoes but because someone kept stepping on them..it was ok though.  So i finally got up the nerve to take them off adn become 52 again with a 6 3 date!  I had the best time dancing with him even though I had to teach him how to dance..thats what makes it fun!  After dancing the night away we strolled on to my house so I could change as I kept taking his jacket because I was cold....but on the way we ran over a RACcOON!  after I took forever to change we went to Andrew's and hung out...after it had rained for a while I remembered I left my window rolled down ROBERT I AM SO SORRY STILL! and he had to clean it all up...we took a nice little stroll around the beach to watch the lightening IT WAS SO PRETTY!....then the night had to end at 2 and even without ice cream that made me sad....I had the best time though thank you all for making last nightthe best ever
    love kaily!"

"event","I've got PMS really bad right now. My mood swings are all out of whack, and its driving me insane. I've gone from sad to happy, and then to extremely depressed...and now I'm both that, and a little bitchy.

I guess I ought to tell you guys how the weekend went, huh? Well, it was alright. I mean, funerals are always sad and all, but we made it through. Its hard to say goodbye to someone you thought of as a brother, but Trey is doing well now that he said his goodbyes. I think that had I not gone he would have been miserable. My dad, thank God for him, has finally come to the understanding that I'm 18 years old and I'm going to do what I want. Mom didn't want me to go, but it was dad that allowed me so I love him even more now.

But...yeah, anyway. I've been told that I'm the only girl Trey has ever brought back to meet his family that hasn't dumped him because of them. I'm pretty proud of that fact...so y'know...

Um...today Kaylea came over and we hung out for a while. I was really happy to see her. It's been a while since we've just sat around and talked for a bit so that was nice.

But uh...now I'm kinda just hanging around here, thinking about some stuff. Maybe if I'm in a better mood I'll update more about the trip to Louisiana. Because besides the fact it was a funeral we were going too, there were some amusing moments."

"event","First one of my friends tries to commit suicide...

Then yesterday I found out another friends mother died...

And today...? The worst so far...

Trey's cousin, Timmy, died. I was there when Susan told Trey the news. I was there when he broke down into tears. I've never seen him like that before, and God it hurt...it hurt so much. I just want to hold him...to comfort him...I want to do so much that I know I can't right now...

I love you, baby. More then you'll ever know! I care for you so much, and I'll always be there for you when you need a shoulder to cry on. I love you..."

"event","So all this week has been Vacation Bible School at our church, and guess who was signed up for it? That's right, me! None of our family signed ourselves up to help so I've decided to blame it on Melody...and Mrs. Storey because she probably did it. But mostly I blame Melody! DAMN YOU, MELODY! DAAAMN YOOOOU! Hehe...umm...so because of that I'm stuck with a bunch of 4-year-olds. Two of which I will certainly kill by tomorrow, but thats besides the point.

This weekend is whats really bugging me. Saturday is the dreaded ACT, of which I haven't studied much like I should have. Hell, I was going to study tonight but after I woke up at 6:00 after going to sleep at NOON...I had to help mom cook, and then the MTV Movie Awards came on.

OMG RYAN GOSLING/RACHAEL MCADAMS OTP!!!!!!!!!!111111

I envy her...sooooo much! I WANNA BE KISSED LIKE THAT, DAMMIT!!! Ummm...I mean...I aaammmm kissed like that...dammit...? Hehehehehe...OH SHIT GONNA DIE FROM STRESSNESS!!!!

ACT + Studying + Evil!Math = OMGBROOKISDED!!!123456789

Yes...it's a laughing matter now, but wait until this weekend is over! IT WON'T BE A LAUGHING MATTER WHEN I DIE, YOU FREAKS!

Just a glimpse
Just a little reminder
Of all the what abouts
And all the might have
Could have beens

Some other way
But not another reason to continue

The wretched

The hopes and prays
The better days

And God himself will reach his fucking arm through
Just to push you down
Just to hold you down
Stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss
And it's hard to believe it could come down to this back at the beginning
Sinking
Spinning

And in the end
We still pretend
The time we spend
Not knowing when
You're finally free
And you could be

It didn't turn out quite the way that you wanted it?

"event","<P>So I've gone and done a lot in the last couple of days. I just haven't really felt like updating in a while...</P>
<P>My nieces, Lakelyn and Kiley came in last weekend. Pack was here until Monday because Sunday he gave his testimony at the old church of ours. I really didn't feel like going but since he had asked Trey and I to go we went anyway. Trey said a certain person kept looking back and giving dirty looks, but I ignored it. Michelle came in with Chad so that was cool. Trey tried to help me steal Jaxson away, but Chad wouldn't let us take him back to my house to play with my nieces so poo on him! We went to Meme's to eat after church, and I stuffed myself so I felt much better. I went home that afternoon and took a nap, too. I wish it could have lasted longer, but sadly I had to get up and go back to Peach Creek for the 5th Sunday night singing. The only reason we went is because Hannah was asked to sing. The whole time I had a headache, but thankfully I was rescued when Pack asked me to take Kiley and Lakelyn down to the nursery.</P>
<P>That night Trey spent the night with us, and we stayed up and watched Shaolin Soccer (It's not in English, Kay!), and then I watched part of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou before I started feeling tired so I went to bed. Trey stayed with me for a little while until I was nearly asleep so it was really nice to have him around cause my stomach was hurting and all...</P>
<P>Umm...also yesterday Trey and I hung out at his house and had a few drinks. Or well...more like I had a ""few drinks"", and he had half of one. Then we decided&nbsp;to go to Chili's (or I decided actually) and since I was a bit tipsy Trey had to drive up there. By the time we got our food and ate it I was back to normal and Trey was just started to get a buzz because he got a Presidente Margarita. I tried it, but I'm not a big lime fan. So since he had a buzz I had to drive back. It's funny cause mom has told me it'll be a while before I can drive to Southaven and whatnot cause I'm ""not ready"", right? Well I've driven there plenty of times. I dunno, but for some reason the more traffic, the more comfortable I am. Of course, the more trouble I get into...too...heh. In Senatobia I nearly ran into a BMW, but that's besides the point! Trey picked on me enough about it... :D</P>
<P>Today I...did nothing. I slept until 11:00, which was amazing cause I dunno how long its been since I've slept that late. Probably a week, but still. Heh. And then I was told I would be watching the nieces while mom and Jon went to gym. I had planned on going out again to see Trey, but I guess its fine. I'll just see him tomorrow. I'm running out of money fast. I'm amazed my one and only paycheck lasted this long, though. It seems I've gotten much better with handling money lately so that's nice to know. Of course, its really annoying for Trey who wants me to get cute clothes for myself but I sit there and debate for half an hour on if I want to go ahead and get it or not. Hehe. But anyway...I'm going to go now. Maybe I'll have something interesting to report next time...</P>
<P>OH WAIT!</P>
<P>I did have a dream about having sex with Adam in his bed. That was amusing. So amusing, in fact, that I texted Adam yesterday about it. Hehe. He wanted me to send him the details via email so he could dream about it too. Ahem, but besides that...nothing. Nope. Notta thing.</P>"

"event","So I just woke up from a very long nap, and during this nap I had a dream. In this dream it featured the band of Sugar Ray, myself, and the main guy character from Grey's Anatomy (who apparently was also in the band).

It also had wrestlers, and other macho manly stuff in it too. I was supposedly a reporter (magazine reporter) and I was doing the latest story on the band and all. Why? Because something big had happened. Mark McGrath had just come out of the closet and admitted he was gay to his bandmates and now he was ready to share it with the world. So, I was doing a story on them and the bandmates of his were having a sort of ""going away"" party for him. Not because he was going away, but because his hetero sexuality was. All I remember was it was supposedly a day full of the guys doing manly stuff like wrestling with the wreslers (I think that guy Big Show was in there) and all of that crap, but my favorite part was at the end of my dream where Mark was saying goodbye and the bandmates of his were waving as his limo started to pull out of the driveway. Mark had decided to end the evening by mooning all of his friends and this was what was said.

""That's the last time we'll ever see that white as of his.""

""Not if one of us goes gay, too.""

I woke up, and I was laughing my ass off. It had been the Grey's Anatomy guy that had made that comment."

"event","<P>So I went to Adam Hamberlin's house Saturday for a swim with Trey. While I was there I stole a picture of Adam for all of the girlies to see, and since we recently got a wicked ass scanner I'm about to go into a scanning frenzy. I went ahead and scanned Adam's picture so I'm going to post it so you all can see how adorable he really is. And he is single, too. Nearly 22.</P>

<P>Today Trey, Jon, and I went to Brittany's graduation party at Enid Lake. It was a really pretty day to be at such a nice lake, but plenty of events happened there that weren't so good. I won't go into them, of course. Tomorrow I'm thinking of going out to look for a few places that are hiring, and then go with Trey again and head back to Adam's for some swim-time. I think Adam likes me enough to see me often since he said he was jealous of Trey and that I was hot and had a hot body. I love Adam to death! :)</P>"

In the line 
Got your chin held high and you feel just fine 
Because you do 
What you're told

Just how deep do you believe? 
Will you bite the hand that feeds? 
Will you chew until it bleeds? 
Can you get up off your knees? 
Are you brave enough to see? 
Do you want to change it?

What if this whole crusade's
A charade
And behind it all there's a price to be paid
For the blood
On which we dine
Justified in the name of the holy and the divine

Just how deep do you believe?

"event","So I went into Huddle House today cause Wes wanted to ""talk to me"". I should have known he was going to fire me, and after I only worked there three days. Apparently I ""don't have what it takes"", but I know the real reason. Lisa, my trainer, wanted me gone. I was supposed to follow her around like a little puppy the whole time I was training there, and I did when I wasn't asked (by her or others but mainly by her) for help in either delivering an order, cleaning off the tables, or other stuff which I was often asked to help with.

Wes told me to follow Lisa everywhere, even to the bathroom, which is so very stupid. I had so many people asking for my help, and even Lisa was telling me to go do this, and go do that. Am I not supposed to help a bit, and take orders from Lisa? I dunno...it doesn't really matter anymore. I rather not work for a prick, and work under two older ladies who happen to hate me anyway.

Oh well. The only thing I'll miss about that job is Hailey and Jill."

"event","<B>""Can you keep up baby boy? Make me lose my breath, bring the noise. Make me lose my breath, make me hot.</B>

Okay, I'm so very happy minus the slight headache I have, but that's not stopping me! I have the whole weekend off, and I'm very excited. I don't think that it'll keep on going like this so every moment this weekend is going to be spent doing stuff I want to do.

So I went to Kay's and tanned for a bit. Brittany wasn't there so I didn't get to hang out with them, but Kay was glad to have company, the poor thing. My baby is all sickly! :(

I stayed from 11ish to about 1:30 with her. We took a moment to go to Crenshaw to the Snack Shack to get ourselves some foodage, which was really good. Greasy Southern food is the best, ya'll! Haha. I don't care how bad the health nuts out there think it is bad for your health, as long as it is good I'll eat it! So then I got in the tanning bed, and Kay and I watched that Ellen talk show. 

When I left Kaybear's I got to Trey's about 2ish and we ended up napping until 4:00 when my alarm went off. So I took my pill (woo), and then called up my boss, Wes. He told me not to come in Saturday, and just call him Sunday cause that was when he was going to do the weeks schedule. This made me very happy. I had planned on getting my haircut and all, but we couldn't get a hold of Emily so we just decided that a movie would be fun.

So we stopped by the ATM (I'm already keeping track of how much I owe mom) then headed out to Southaven. We saw the movie Crash, which made Trey and I really sad. It was a real eye opener about how racist this world is, and what's worse is most everyone else there was LAUGHING at the sad parts, and the racism! Keep in mind that Trey and I were one of the very few white people in there. I really don't understand, though, how they could have though half of the movie was so funny? It really made me sad, and I wanted to cry through half of the movie. I was really upset with all of the laughing in the theather. But oh well, what can you do?

Right...so after that, Trey and I went to Sonic and talked about the movie while we waited for our food. I wasn't the only one upset over all of that. Then after getting Trey some food (I wasn't really hungry) we stopped by a gas station and bought some alcohol. Well, let's just say the rest of the night was pretty damn good. :)

Today I woke up a few times during the morning, but I really ended up sleeping until 2:30ish. So I got up and fixed myself something good. I cooked myself some eggs, homemade pancakes, and some toast. It was so fucking good! So I was planning on going to Kay's to tan some more, and since I didnt get to get my haircut yesterday I was going to see if I could today but since I slept so long I dunno what exactly I'm doing now! I kinda want to go rent a movie, but I dunno...I may just stay here tonight?"

Okay so work was just a load of bullshit, and I honestly didn't like it. I just wasn't in the best of moods today, and it showed because I was just...not there in mind or spirit. Hailey and Mrs. Pat were off today, which sucked, but Jill was in so I had someone to giggle with. Cindy is alright, and Lisa is just...Lisa. OH MAN! SHE SMILED TODAY! That's the first time since starting there that I saw her SMILE! I was almost going to say something to her about it, but I didn't.

Blah, blah, blah...

So the best part of today happened to NOT be the part were 30 minutes before I was supposed to get off work I was able to go back into the break room because Charlotte told me I had to see the Huddle House video (though it comes in a close 2nd. I love cheesy videos!), BUT...

I GET TOMORROW OFF! WEEEEEE!!

So my plans? So far I plan on seeing if I can go to Kay's for a bit to tan, then to Trey's where he and I can hopefully go to Southaven so I can get my haircut by Emily, and also possibly see a movie. It'll be fun. And not only that, but my parents AND siblings will be gone to Nashville until sometime Saturday afternoon so I'm extremely excited to get some peace, quiet, and relaxation without bickering siblings.

Damn...now I have a craving for some Smirnoff...

Wow. I just realized how boring and adult like I sound...minus the Smirnoff part, I guess? Haha."

"event","So I started my training at Huddle House today. My feet are KILLING ME...but it is a lot of fun! I kind of wish now that I had signed up for the morning shift because the people there at that time are awesome. Jill, one of my coworkers, was the one ""training"" me today. She is really cool, and there is an older lady named Mrs. Pat that I've grown very fond of. My boss, Wes, is alright I guess but since I'm new and all he is probably just being extra nice to me.

I mainly bused tables, took drink orders, and did the odd jobs in the back rooms. At one point I forgot to put a coffee pot under the brewer and started it then left it there for a minute or two so coffee got all over the counter and burners. We all found that extremely funny! And Mrs. Pat took a water sprayer and when I spoke to her she turned around and the hose went up, shooting water over the bar. AND...I was filling a kechup bottle and it overflowed. Besides that, nothing really bad happened.

Tomorrow I'm supposed to follow a girl named Lisa around. That makes me sad cause Lisa wasn't there so I haven't met her at all, and I really love being around Jill more then anyone else. I dunno how many times when things got slow on her end that she and I snuck off to the break room so she could have a smoke, and I could rest my feet a moment.

But anyway, I'm done rambling and now I'm gonna go rest my feet. I'll probably soak them or something. Toodles!"

"event","Okay, so today was pretty damn good except that I got sunburnt on my shoulders, cheeks, and the top of my head. The TKD demonstration is over so that's fun and happyfied, and I got to hang out with all of my buddies today.

After the demonstration Dubby, Jeremy, Kay, Jon, and I went to the Chinese Buffet for a bit to chill out because we were all hot, and we were waiting to see what Dubby was going to do. Our original plan was to see a 4:45 movie, but by the time we got out of there it was 4:00 and Jeremy wanted all of us (Trey had by then joined the group) to go back to the gym and play a board game (I forgot what it was now). So we went to the gym and waited for Dubby and Jeremy to get there with the game Jeremy was going to borrow from a friend.

Turns out he doesn't have it. OKAY!

So after sitting around the (very hot) gym, and Dubby lifting Kaylea's skirt up to show her ass to the world, we decide to go back to Trey's house. All of us. I mean...ALL of us. It was crazy. We got there, and the guys mainly played Halo 2 while Kay and I cuddled on the bed and then Dubby like touched/squeezed Kay's boob. We were all trying to figure out what to do when we decided, ""7:00 movie!"". Well, Dubby went home to change and get ready and so did Jeremy. Dubby calls back a while later and goes, ""Jeremy says he can't come."" so by the time Dubby gets here it is 15 'til 7:00 so...screw that idea. So where do we go?

IHOP! WOO!

Good food, stupid waitress, talks of fat-assed strippers. It was great! And the food was really good so we were all very happy. Not to mention Dubby shed a few tears, he was laughing so freaking hard at something Trey said! Haha!

So after that Dubby decides to take the back roads through Coldwater to get to Trey's house. So we go down the road toward his (Dubby's) house and Trey talks about how he used to live around the area and used to go climb the fire tower. So when we start to get near the fire tower, guess what happens? Oh yes, ladies and gentleman, WE STOP and WE CLIMB IT. Of course, Kaylea and I are VERY frightened of heights, and going up like ten to like fifteen flights of WOODEN, OLD stairs that are loose and cracked is like...kiiiinda freaky! BUT...we both made it to the top! Woo! It was pretty cool when we finally got up there, but once my feet touched the ground my legs started to lock up and I got leg cramps which sucked. So from there it was back to Trey's house were we bummed around for a few minutes then Dubby took Kay home, and I left with Jon to go home as well.

Okay, so I get home and Kaylea messages me, right? Well, it seems Raven had left her a message or an email or something about how she was so sad, mad, and depressed about how Kaylea flaunted Dubby in front of her(Okay, seriously, FLAUNTED? When the fuck did she FLAUNT!?), and how Kay also talked about going to the movie and eating without inviting her as well.

All I have to say is - <i>BOO HOO</i>. I mean, this makes me want to laugh so much! First of all, Kaylea has never ""flaunted"". She is not one to flaunt. We had asked Dubby a while back if he was going to go to the movie with us, and we needed an answer but we couldn't get <i>Raven</i> to leave Dubby alone for ONE SECOND so I, note that I said <i>I</i>, got sick of trying to get him away from her so I could ask him privately so <i>I</i> (once again, note that) asked him straight out if he was going or not. Raven is like this little leech that won't let go after attaching itself to its prey, I promise you! There was hardly a moment where Dubby was left alone by her, and the only way I was able to ask him in the first place if he wanted to go was to tell Jon to go get him and drag him over to me in a shady, secuded spot. Raven and I are trying to stay on good terms, I know, but she really needs to get a grip on reality and move on! 

And not inviting her to go with us? OH MY GOD. All I can tell her is welcome to <i>my</i> world! I was supposedly her ""best friend"", but before things just totally quit working for us she ditched me for Dubby! She won't admit it, of course, but I'd always overhear her talking about how they all went out the night before, or she'd even TELL me all of this shit that made me feel so fucking left out of everything! Hell, that time at the pool pond when everyone went to go see a movie afterwards, I remember Raven talking about it <i>IN FRONT OF MY FACE</i>, and not even bothering to ask me if I wanted to go! I thought I was her friend, and yet she ditched me to hang out with Jeremy, Dubby, and Kaylea. Now that it is happening to her she can't take it, and it really makes me want to laugh and show her how <i>I</i> felt! All she had to do was ask me if I wanted to go to a party, or see a movie with them. That's all my <i>""best friend""</i> had to do was to ask. 

But did she ever? No. So I can damn well do the same thing to her if I fucking want to."

Hamalong:: omg that would be so cool. 
Red Weasley:: It so would be!
Hamalong:: I have found my direction in life! I will be the inventor of weird and useless things!
Red Weasley:: We also need to make things like a device that makes taking thongs off easier, and hands-free. Making us humans even more lazy then we already are. XD
Hamalong:: lmao yes!!

He gave me until 1:30.

I hadn't had a shower, so I hopped in there and got out at the wicked fast speed of three minutes, threw on some makeup which took like five minutes, and ran out the door. I was going about 80 the whole way, and I was 15 minutes late. Thanks to Dakota, however, she told the guy it took me aout 20-30 minutes to get to Senatobia from my house so that was good. After we talked for a bit he told me to come in for training at 7:00 in the morning on Wednesday and gave me a manual, and uniform. The shirt he gave me is a man's size small. Lovely. So I'll have to take that back, I'll probably take it tomorrow if I can.

I'm working the 2nd shift, which is from 1:00PM to 7:00PM. I'll have to quit Taekwon-Do, and I'm working Monday through Friday - sometimes Saturdays. Already both Trey and Kaylea don't like it, but a job is a job, right?

I dunno...suddenly I'm not liking my decision..."

"event","The only thing good really about the Homeschool Graduation was the fact that I got to see Brittany, Kaylea, Chelsea, and Nick. The graduation, as always, started off badly with one of the guys being stuck in traffic or something. Traffic? In or around Senatobia? Impossible! Unless, of course, he was coming from further away, I guess...

I was actually in a happy mood when we went, I sat up in the balcony with Chels, Nick, Kay, Dustin (a guy Kay knows. He is cute.) and my loverly Trey. Some bitch lady sat in front of Trey and I, and she blocked my view for most of the time. Stupid lady. The whole power point thing sucked ass, and we sat there and laughed at it and how Southern everyone sounded. Sure, we have our moments, but actually we don't sound as bad - especially as bad as some of the GUYS! God, that was horrible. By the time THAT was all over we were ready to leave and go eat, but some speaker got up. It was really hot in the balcony and we were all hungry so we sat around and messed with each other.

There is one thing I hate about Christian speakers like that. We were at a graduation, it was not a Sunday church thing and he got off on the whole graduation thing and into God and knowing him and stuff. This would have been fine, of course, had he not been soooo long-winded and we had not been STARVING! Let alone had it not been REALLY HOT as well as STORMING outside! ARGH!

Ahem...

Kay-bear and I woo-ed when Brittany got her shit. We thought the boys would do it too, but they were dumbasses and didn't. XD

When Mallory sang we all were giggling and Trey went, ""I bet she is gonna go home and cry."" because the guy had to stop the song cause it was messing up and she had to stand there for a few seconds with no music playing or anything. Must have been really embarassing.

After everything was over I went and said hi to Brit, found out if Kay was going home with me, and also asked Chels was she wanting to go home with me as well and when I found out everything I went back to Trey's where the lights were out. We were like laying in his bed for a while with candle-light it was nice...but hot. A few minutes later we decided to go to town where I could gas up my car, and we could get something to eat at Wendy's. So we took seperate cars so that I could leave from there and so Trey could make sure the weather wasn't bad cause if it had been he wouldn't let me go home...alone, at least. He freaks out about me driving in storms, but I can understand why. I'm his baby, and he wouldn't want anything bad to happen to me. :)

So I got home cause it wasn't raining anymore, and I watched Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. It's a good movie, I liked it. So I went to bed and woke up at 2:00 in the afternoon! I haven't done that in MONTHS! It felt good. Especially since I had a really awesome dream that lasted waaay long and was not interrupted.

It was about a guy from the One Tree Hill show, this guy plays Nathan (and he played Nathan in this dream, to). Of course, there was a twist and he had a twin brother I didn't know about. I was apparently Nathan's girlfriend or fiancee or something and when I met Nathan's twin brother (oddly enough, his name was Luke. There is a Lucas in the show which is Nathan's stepbrother) I fell in love with him and junk. It was nice. I like nice dreams like that. So I woke up happeh cause lately my dreams have been people dying a lot and crap.

Anywho...I called Trey and asked if he wanted to come over here and stay with me today. We rented Lemony Snicket's, Hotel Rwanda, and Ocean's Twelve. And Kaylea is going to the movie store today, too, and she copies her movies so we could very well have some more stuff to watch in the next few days. Who knows? All I know is that I need to get myself something to eat now.

Toodle pip!"

"event","Okay, so today was actually better then I thought it would be. I was dead to the world until noon, which is weird for me because lately I've been at least up by 10:00 or before. I remember having a dream about going shopping with Paris Hilton. I blame it on both Kaylea, and Trey. Mwuahahaa!

Anyway, I woke up and mom yelled at me for not getting out to go job hunting. Um, okay, moving on. Didn't give a damn.

<i>""I'm just the way the doctor made me!""</i>

Hehe...

So um, I went with Jon to gym. It was just the two of us this time, but I didn't spend much time there. Jeremy came out for a bit because I was sitting out in my car messing with my cellphone, knowing I'd have to move for the car parked in front of me to get out. He got into my car and talked to me for a bit. I'm really not sure how much I liked that, I was happy with my privacy.

So then I called up Kay-bear to find out where she was at, and what time the graduation practice started. I had to go up there to give Diana Cecil a pack of patches and since Kay couldn't seem to find the church Brittany and Kay came to the gym and picked me up. It was really cool, we went to the church and according to Brittany we got a lot of dirty looks from ""certain"" people. I was amused by that so outside of the church us three started talking loudly about ""pickles"" (that was amusing), getting drunk after the gradutation ceremony, and then some other stuff I forgot. Because of how effing LOOONG it was I got a call from Jon saying that gym was over so I asked if the Scotts could bring him over to the church because the four of us were going to go eat afterwards. We were going to invite Dubby, but he had some game he really wanted to get home and play so we didn't bother.

We ended up going to McDonalds (our like...official hangout place I swear) and saw a couple of hot guys. Apparently McDonalds was the place to be for hot college and highschool guys, I mean whoa! Some of them flirted with us, and I ended up having to tell a guy flirting with me that though flattering, I was taken. It was really amusing. He had asked for my phone number! Haha! Poor thing. So then T.C. came over (he was like, the only blackbelt black guy around the gym during the first year of me doing TKD) and flirted with us girls. He does that a lot, though, so I just don't pay much attention. I love him, though. He is cool. He says he is going to come back to class sometime next month so that's awesome. I'll see more of him, but I bet he'll be flirting with us all a lot. Heh. Oh well.

We also had rather naughty things constructed with the aid of ice-cream and french fries. I call it, ""Ode to Little Dubby"". It was amusing. And Kay-bear and Brit put ice down each others shirts. Jon also flirted openly with T.C. which was really amusing as well.

After we ate the four of us went back to the gym where Jon and I got my car and headed home. It was almost 10:00 when we got in but it was all good. Tomorrow I'm going out job hunting then heading to Trey's. I'll stay at his house until 6:30 which is when I'll head over to the graduation thing cause Kay wants me there early since she will have to be there early as well. I think the three (I would say four, but Trey needs to be the sober one) of us should go have a celebration and get drunk after the ceremony, but thats just me! Haha...wow...I'm gonna be an alcoholic. Haha!"

The bastard is just jealous, he and I both know that. He told me he cared for her a while back and I know he still does. He is just being stupid, you know? Well, his stupidity is about to get him into serious trouble with me.

I heard from Dakota tonight that he had been talking about the Dubby and Raven thing. That makes me sick. Really, it does! I can only wonder how many other people he has told? Honestly, it's none of his business in the first place! I'm just...ugh. God, I hate him! I usually try to refrain from saying the word, but I honestly hate him right now.

"event","So yesterday was fun for the most part. The seminar sucked majorly, as I hadn't been in class for almost two weeks total and my legs and arms are paying for it now. It was from noon to 4:00 and by 2:00 I was hurting. Every muscle in my leg was pulled, and it hurt to stand up. So about 3:30 they start doing sparring, and I thought, ""Hell no, I'm not gonna do that!"" and told Mr. Storey I had to sit this one out. He was cool with it cause he loves me. I'm his favorite. Hehehe.

Right, so anyway, after the seminar we went over to Trey's house. Kaylea and I automatically went to the bed, laid down, and whined about how we got hurt so bad. She got kicked in the rib really hard by a BLACKBELT and it knocked the breath out of her. I wouldn't be surprised if he actually broke her damn rib! He was careless, and stupid. I hate the people from Louisiana, they always come in thinking they are so much higher then us and it drives me insane.

While at Trey's I got in the bathtub and soaked my aching muscles. It was really funny because after I got out I wrapped a towel around me and opened the door cause I had asked Trey to get my bag cause it has my clothes in it so he placed it at the door and when I opened the door Mrs. Susan was standing there and went, ""What are you doin' -Brooke you're NAKED!"" and I busted out laughing. I love that woman. Seriously, she is awesome. When I came back in the room I felt much better. My legs didn't ache as much anymore, and I felt better mood-wise, too.

After that Kaylea decided she wanted to put some eyeliner on Trey, who agreed to it because he ""wanted to look like Johnny Depp"". But uh...you know how us girls are - if we start something, we have to finish it. By the time Kay was done he had not only eyeliner, but mascara, blush, eyeshadow, and lipgloss on. Had he shaven his little goatee he would have looked like the hottest drag queen ever! I'm not sure how he felt about that, but Mr. Chuck was so embarrassed for him. I don't think he'll look at his son the same way ever again. Hehehe.

So once the makeup was washed off (sadly there were no pictures taken - maybe next time?) the four of us set out to go eat. We went to Chili's where our waiter was hit on by Kaylea and Jon. That was amusing to watch to say the least! In the end he asked for her number. Kay is such a pimp! Haha! Oh, and we got Trey to buy us a Strawberry Daiquiri to share so that was nice, but some idiot made it much stronger by adding more Rum in there then the Daiquiri mix so it tasted much more bitter then it usually does. Oh, and sitting right behind us while we drank the Daiquiri was an old teacher of mine from my chuch who wouldn't say anything to me when I said hi. She was probably mad when she saw the Daiquiri sitting there, but like I give a damn what she thinks! Stupid people...I barely drink as it is so why not let me have a drink every once in a while and not scold me for it? It doesn't matter what she says, though. If she tells mom it won't matter because I've told mom that I've had sips of Trey's drinks before, and by next Sunday I bet the old woman won't even remember it!

Right...so we went to go see Kung Fu Hustle. It was pretty amusing, and the main actor guy was really fucking hot! For a while Kay was talking up a storm during the movie but she finally settled down on my shoulder and we giggled over the hottness of the Asian guy. He was nice. Jon had planned on wearing Chris' old Kung Fu uniform, but after I pressed it Jon threw it in his bag and it got wrinkly again.

After the movie Kay and I were trying to figure out what to do because we knew the night shouldn't end so soon. We all ended up in Hernando stuffing some money into Trey's hand, and telling him to buy us some alcohol. I've never had anything other then a Strawberry Daiquiri, but I figured what the hell, and just went with it. Trey ended up coming out with one bottle of Smirnoff. We had wanted two, but Trey didn't want me ""going off and getting drunk"". We told him it was only 5% alcohol, but ah well. It really didn't matter to us, we just wanted something. So then we went back to Trey's house where I called up dad and asked if Kay could spend the night with me. He said yes, naturally, but Trey had to stay home. It was sad cause I didn't want to leave him, but we let him have a sip of our Smirnoff before we packed it up in the truck in Kay's gym bag, and left. I felt so bad...I still feel bad, too. Ugh...I wanna call him... :(

When we got home (this is AFTER we had to deal with a stupid gas lady who didn't know what the hell she was doing) we talked to dad for a bit before going back into my room and breaking out the bottle. It was that Twisted stuff in Green Apple flavor that we got, and it was really good. Kay and I were talking about how we need to try all of the other flavors and whatnot. We only had half a glass each since we had one bottle, and after talking to Trey to tell him we were safely to my house, I was ready to go to bed. That stuff makes you groggy! Of course...I was a little before, too. Hehe. So by about 1:30 we were fast asleep. We had to get up at 8:00 this morning so that I could take Kaylea back to her house so she could go to church, and when we got up all we wanted to do was stay in the covers and go back to sleep. Bleh. Oh well...heh.

So yeah...that was our night. It was really fun though there were some rough parts throughout it. I just wish Trey could have stayed with us..."

"event","So today is bound to be entertaining. First this morning I woke up at about 6:30 for...no reason at all, and then at 8:00 my alarm went off to tell me it was time to go milk mom's damn goats. This is the only reason I hate it when she leaves, I always have to milk those stupid goats! I hate doing that!

Anyway, now I'm home and getting ready for a Taekwon-Do seminar going on from noon to 4:00 this afternoon. From there Jon, Trey, Kaylea, and I are going to go see Kung Fu Hustle so it should be fun. Besides, when we four get together - it's a party!"

That...wow. Just wow! That was <i>the most</i> amusing sentence in the recorded history of the Robinson family clan. Heh. Just...wow...

We also then went to Steak n' Shake, which was also very good (I GOT A HOT FUDGE SUNDAE SO NOW I'M ALL HYPED UP! WOO!). Tonight was just a very good night, and I didn't even want to kill my parents!

So then I woke up this morning and I really didn't feel like ""going out"" like I had last night. After talking to Kaylea, I found out she wasn't going to a wedding that Jeremy had asked her to go with him. His grandmother is in the hospital, really ill to the point she may not make it is what they are saying.

Right...so after finding out Kay is not going to be doing anything but sitting around her house most of the day I decided why not Trey come over to my house, and I go get Kay, and the four of us just hang out and watch some movies? Not only that, but I think Kay is planning on staying the night with me, which makes me all happeh inside. Hehe!

So tonight will be fun, and we'll barely be spending any money! Haha! Though Trey may have to get some gas...so who knows! And Kay already said she could get the movies because her dad owns a Blockbuster, which is cool. It's gonna be a really fun night. XD"

"event","Okay, I had planned on being asleep by now, but I have to get this off of my chest. And what better way to do it then to post it for my friends to see? It helps, y'know?

When Kaylea and Liz are around Trey, he gets into his little ""I'm a sex god, and I want you"" mood and plays around with them. This doesn't bother me in the least, why? Because I know Kay and Liz would never do anything to jeopardize our friendship, and Trey wouldn't do anything with them because if he did he'd be paranoid for the rest of his life wondering if I was really hurt and upset by it.

But when it comes to him telling me about the latest girl to have a bit of a crush on him at Ole Miss, I go into a jealous rage. When talking to him tonight he had another beep, a friend of his at Ole Miss contacted him to tell him that a girl in their class together asked him (we'll call him Josh for a lack of name) some questions about Trey, and told him that she thought Trey was cute. She also mentioned she knew Trey had a girlfriend, and would respect that. But even when Trey told me this I felt really jealous and paranoid. I don't know this girl at all, I've never met her once. I haven't met the people he goes to school with and I know I shouldn't be too worried about it, but I am. It's not that I don't trust Trey, I do. I know he wouldn't do anything to hurt me! I just don't trust this girl because I've never met her before, and I don't know her. Trey doesn't really talk much about the people he is in classes with.

I'm paranoid because I'm afraid she'll do something, like kiss him or something, and he won't know how to react to it. In my mind I keep having this really pretty girl going to kiss him and he just stands there shocked and not able to respond. I'd hope he would automatically pull away and remind her that he has a girlfriend and he could never do that to me, but I know that sometimes when you are caught off guard like that you can forget how you should be acting towards it.

When I was on the phone with him, I was a little jealous and paranoid but I was okay. I had other things on my mind besides that, and I didn't have time to really think about it. When I finally settled down, my brain started to work overtime and play these stupid senarios where the pretty girl is kissing Trey, and making me think on it more then I wanted to. It just...it really put me in a bad mood. I want Trey to have a million photos of me and show it to every single girl who shows any interest in him, but even when I told him he ought to have a picture of me in his notebook or somewhere that others could possibly see it he told me that would seem kind of rude. I know it is, and I know I'm being extremely selfish. I know he is flattered to find out that a girl is showing interest in him, but all I want is for all of the girls in the world to not look at him in any way. I want him to be invisible to all but me! And I'm just being so damn selfish when I say that...

I'm supposed to see Trey tomorrow, and suddenly I'm not sure if I want to because I know he reads this, and I don't want to seem to him like I'm being ridiclous. I already know I am...but I just can't seem to stop myself..."

"event","<b>Tuesday ~</b> Mom woke me up early, like 9ish early to go job hunting before gym. That was all fine and dandy with me but I still wasn't ready to go by the time noon rolled around. So at noon I was logged onto AIM and IMed Kaylea who happened to need to come to my house in order to catch a ride with me to gym. She asked me what time to be there, and I told her either 5:00 or she could come now and head out with me to Batesville and keep me company. She asked her mom, and ended up getting here about 1:00.

After I had finished talking to her Trey called me, asking what I was doing today. I told him going to Batesville with Kaylea to hunt for a job, and he asked if I could come pick him up at Ole Miss. Now, I've never driven to Oxford let alone through Ole Miss, but I told him we'd see and then got Jon up to get him ready to head out so that if we DID pick Trey up we could just go straight to the gym.

It. Was. Hot.

I wish dad would get the air on the car fixed because we were sweating up a storm! But it doesn't matter, we had fun. We hung around Wal-Mart for an hour (yeah, no ""job hunting"" like I was supposed to be doing. No time. Or money for gas.) and played with some big bouncy balls. Kay and I also tried looking for the Zodiac Sign Barbie of Jon's, but we didn't find it. Then we went to McDonalds where my darling Kaylea bought us all food (Thanks babe! I owe you one!). It was by that time about 3:30 and we started heading to Ole Miss to pick Trey up (which mom doesn't know about, and won't know about either). He called me up when we were passing Shady Groves, and I told him I'd be there soon.

When we got there, Kaylea and I saw some hot guys in the redest of shorts. They looked like they had just come from that show Baywatch, I swear! Haha! And we missed the parking lot entrance and had to turn around only to find out moments later that Trey was going to be walking by us anyway. When we got him I drove us all to Senatobia where we went to Trey's to (like we planned) ""drop him off"". Riiight. We ended up NOT going to class because Kay and I were too busy cuddling up with Trey in bed while Jon went through Trey's music files and played us different tunes. Also, Trey gave Kaylea some lapdances, which was amusing. We've decided Trey needs to be a stripper because he would make an awesome one! Hehe! Sadly he didn't get paid but a dollar for the lapdances, but he was okay with it because Kay is now his newest victim, and he loves her to death just like I do. OH! And Kay now has a picture of Trey's crotch, which Jon took with her camera. Annnd PLENTY of pictures of us all cuddling on the bed, one with Trey spreading his legs! Haha! And then one of Kay and I, but Trey missed when Kay kissed me so he didn't get that. :)

We decided that we'd go after gym was over and try to work on ladies self-defense, but when we got there Gray informed us it had been cut out of the demonstration. We were not pleased. No, not pleased at all. But at least we got to have our love fest with Trey so it was all good! Heh. And we hung around to talk to Dubby, who ended up taking Kaylea home. So then I took Trey back to his house and Jon and I headed back home ourselves. It was 9:30 when we got in, but ah well! I called up Trey and we planned that I would come over after my GED test the next day, then I talked to a few people on AIM, and then I went to bed at midnight.

<b>Wednesday ~</b> I woke up at 5:00 in the morning to the storm going on outside. I heard a tree branch fall and hit the shed roof, which scared the crap outta me. Then I finally got back to sleep only to have my phone AND my alarm clock going off! I had set my phone to go off just incase the lights went off so I wouldn't be late for the test. When I finally got out of here it was still raining, but not too bad. I was able to make it to Northwest on time. The clouds were really dark, which meant at any moment it would start pouring. Of course, when I GOT to Northwest all of the parking spots for blocks were taken. I should have remembered that, and went an hour early just to find one but I didn't. So after circling around the blocks three times (it was exactly 10:50 when I got there, and at 10:00 was the test for the math part) it started to pour. I was going to call up mom and ask her what I should do because there was no place to go, and the test had already begun by then, but I called up Trey's house by accident. The reception was really bad and for some reason my phone wouldn't end the call so I drove while trying to ask if Susan could hear me.

Then...it started hailing.

I threw the phone into the passenger seat and kept my focus on the road, and the hail was so bad I decided now was a good time to get out of there. Screw the test, I could take it another time! So I headed out of town towards Trey's house. Once I got past New Town (Or was it Old...?) the clouds weren't so bad so I was getting away from the storm in town, which was good for me. It got to where I got out of the pouring down rain so I could finally see the roads and that's when I called up mom and told her what was up. She told me to come on home, but I told her I was going to wait it out for a while at Trey's before I attempted to drive back. She was cool with it all so I called up Trey's and told Susan could she please unlock the door for me, and she told me yeah so I told her I'd be there soon.

When I finally got to his house I told Trey everything that happenened, and we decided to lay down and take a nap. I slept from 11ish to about 2:30 which is when mom called and told me that there were some Tornado Warning going on, and the storm wasn't about to let up anytime soon so I should just come on home. I didn't end up leaving until 4:30 because Susan didn't want me out in the rain. So I just hung around and played with Jaxson for a bit, and cuddled up with Trey a little more until the rain finally cleared enough that I could drive in it. The whole way back it barely rained all that much until I was just half a mile away so I was very happy with waiting until I did. I called up Trey as soon as I got in, and cooked myself something warm to eat...and now I'm here, writing all of this to you.

I wonder what tomorrow is going to be like...?"

"event","Yes. Job hunting today.

Mom wants me to work at a place where I can get health benefits. That's all fine and dandy, but that basically leaves Lowe's, Wal-Mart, and a few select restaurants. I'm just thinking about trying the Wal-Mart in Senatobia, even though its crappy. I rather work in Senatobia so that when I actually <i>get</i> into Northwest I'll be close by. I <i>don't</i> want to have to travel to Senatobia then to Batesville, and then home again. My paychecks would be wasted on gas money, and I'd have nothing.

And I'd be closer to Trey if I got a job in Senatobia. How is that good? Simple, if I'm having a shitty day at work or something after I get off I could go see him, and HE is the one who helps make my days much better. Hell, he is the only one who is keeping me IN this world so of COURSE he'd be the one to cheer me up!

Really, I don't know what I'd do without him."

Have you SEEN who is playing Lord Voldemort in the GoF movie?!

Ralph Fiennes!! He is A HOTTIE!!!!

Of course, seeing as how he is going to play a snake man type of person I highly doubt he'll look very sexy, but at least I know Liz and I will so be looking beneath all of that makeup to see TEH SEX that this guy is! I say Liz cause...I mean...one word, Gandalf. XD

"event","Okay, first a recap of this week...end.

Friday ~ Don't remember it.

Saturday ~ I went to Trey's for the afternoon and then Kaylea called and said that Dubby was cool with going to the movies. So, we all piled up in Dubs car and went to see Hostage and also ate at Chili's. It was the second time seeing Hostage for Trey and I, but we liked the movie enough to see it again. The bad dude? Scary as fuck! I shivered when I saw his eyes in the dark. But it was good to see it again, especially with friends. Dubby was half asleep, and also still had a bit of a hangover so everything was funny to him. Trey had at one point sang to a country song going, ""I slept with my sister!"" and about 30 minutes later (I swear to you!) when we were coming out of Target Dubby busted out laughing and went, ""Haha! Dude! 'I slept with my sister'!"". And we almost crashed on the way back because Dubby couldn't find his CD case for his Kenny Shitney. HAH! I made a funny...

Seriously. No, seriously. Rap...and country. That's his taste. It's so sad. Someone needs to hit him over the head with something blunt, and sharp! Anyway, I ended up getting home past 1:00 in the morning. Came in to a pissed off mom, but it didn't last long. She finally went on to bed after whining about how its my fault she had to get up in the morning to cook for her class. 

Yeah, okay.

Also, I got online to find out I'd been accused of putting up some comments about Raven or something on Kaylea's journal. Who were they? Well, one of them was Kay's friend, and then one other was Trey who felt like being...himself. I swear, that boy! I sent her an email that night to clear up a few things because I hadn't even <i>bothered</i> getting into this petty little ""war"". I think its stupid. But now it has about gotten out of hand.

Sunday ~ Easter Sunday, but didn't wear my new dress. It was too rainy and cold to. Every Easter is like that around here. I don't think I've ever seen a sunny Easter Sunday. So after services I went over to Trey's for the day. We spent most of it in bed cuddling, something I loved to pieces. It was the perfect day to just lay around and be lazy. Rainy days are always the best to do that in. Its just something about rain that makes you a lazy ass sometimes. But we actually got up that night to go to Wal-Mart, Movie Gallery, and McDonalds. And we watched Alfie, too! Mmm...Jude Law!

So...I lost my train of thought...so I'm just going to leave it there for now. If I think of anything else, I'll update. Wee.

<b>[Edit]</b> <i>SHOPPING</i>!! Friday I went shopping for my Easter dress!! THANK YOU TREY FOR REMINDING ME WHAT I DID! XD"

"event","Dear Mandi, please do not stop posting on LiveJournal.  I promise I will write more often and comment, comment, comment.  Besides, I'm coming to Jacksonville this weekend!  I'll call you, hopefully before you read this.  
I swear it smells like spring outside.  The weatherman said today should be the last of the really cold days here in Pensacola, which I'm glad for.  Sean complained that we won't get a winter, but I think that's what we've been having for two weeks and it was depressing.  My only problem with spring, and eventually summer getting here is that it makes me wish for my Fiat so I can ride with the top down.  I know half of you reading probably think that's silly, but I can dream.  Oh, Mike Prieto if you still read this, I saw Royce Ingram's picture in the Pensacola business paper.  He was in the people-on-the-move section for getting a job at a mortgage company or something.  Funny, huh?  I guess that's pretty much all I have, for now.  Yesterday a customer was in wanting to build a fire pit, and he said, ""That is just the cat's meow for me.""  I like men who say things like that.  Ok that's all.  Cheers."

"event","Hello friends.  I have a few minutes with nothing to do where I can update.  I'm at Dad's house, where I came with the promise of BBQ ribs, but am going to end up eating pizza.  It's cool.  We ordered Socio's Al's Favorite (?) or something.  Houston swears it's the best.  I vacuumed my car tonight and shined it up with some Armor All so now I'm not ashamed for people to ride in my car.  So if you need a ride somewhere, I will come and pick you up.  The outside needs to be washed too; I wasn't in the mood to do it this afternoon, but maybe I can trade the three amigos a wash for lunch or a six pack of XX.  Speaking of the three amigos, a couple of weeks ago I started taking a Spanish class they're offering at church for <i>free</i>.  I'm so stoked about it.  I went to the beach by myself again today.  I can't explain to you how glorious this is.  It's indescribable what's so great about it, but the best part is that there's no one there with me.  I don't even feel uncomfortable in my bathing suit, I feel like I look good.  You can't buy that.  Remember how good my beach mix was the last time I went?  Well, today I put my iPod on shuffle, all songs in the entire thing.  Up until now I haven't really done that, and I was a little worried that I had so far filled my sweet Pod with things that I don't listen to ever.  Or I was kind of afraid that my iPod would pick the crappiest songs in my collection.  But I learned that I can trust my iPod to come up with a great mix.  It gave me the most chill, relaxed, beach-appropriate mix possible.  I feel like my brain's running really fast, too fast for a Sunday night.  Pizza's here.  I'm going to sit on the couch and eat dinner.  I hope Best Week Ever's on.  Love you."

"event","One of the good things about being in college is that if you have to do something crappy like go to Wal*Mart to buy groceries, you can usually find someone to go with you.  Usually I like Wal*Mart, but having someone with you is infinitely better.  There aren't people I can call like that in Pensacola.  It's not exactly the same kind of community.  I went to the beach today for the first time this summer.  I went by myself, which was nice.  I made a sweet playlist on my iPod and shuffled it, full of Jack Johnson, the Beach Boys, Stevie Wonder, the Beatles, one Coldplay, one Ben Folds, Seal IV.  It wasn't bad, if I say so myself.  There was a big family there who sounded like they had an island accent of some sort.  One of the men, I guess he was the dad, was chasing the girls around and throwing them in the water; they were fun to watch.  And they were wearing neon swimming caps.  I had a shower when I came home and watched two Seinfeld episodes while drying off.  The day has seemed long and pleasant.  I enjoyed lunch with my dad and Houston.  I gave Dad a riding lawn mower battery for Father's Day; Houston said every time he mows the lawn he has to jump it.  It's a funny present, but I think it made him really happy.  He told me about a meeting he had with my mom over the settlement that was upsetting.  Two of the most appropriate words for all this are <i>hard</i> and <i>sad</i>.  Simply, it comes down to that.  But it's much more complicated than that.  Please someone help me have more faith.  But I'm happy.  I'm happy to have gotten sun today.  That feels satisfying."

"event","I'm a selfish livejournaler.  I want all of my friends to update, and frequently.  I only update once in a blue moon though; all take and no give.  The thing is I feel like whatever I write on here is going to be worthless and uninteresting.  The other night I was in Wal*Mart, behind a guy in line buying two boxes of votive candles, some deoderant, and some condoms.  All these things make it look like he expected to get lucky that night, but I felt like he would do the word ""lucky"" justice.  Poor guy.  The same night at the same Wal*Mart someone was walking around leaving their raw meat random places.  Package of raw chicken on the bread aisle, right next to the whole wheat.  A package of bacon thrown in the watermelon bin.  Who would do such a thing?  See, this is all I have.  On the real-life update side, I'm riding with my dad, brother, and husband (last but certainly not least) to Texas for our family reunion.  This is good and bad.  I'm really looking forward to seeing my grandparents, Katie, Aunt Nancy; and it's always fun.  It's bad because I'll be riding for so long in a car with my dad.  But, I have four new books to read, and I'm determined to finish them all while I'm gone.  If you haven't already heard, Sean and I are thinking of moving to Tallahassee so he can finish school at FAMU.  I'm pretty excited about the idea.  In fact, the only thing that makes me apprehensive is finding a new job.  I don't have a career, so I don't even know where to begin looking.  Nor do I know what I want to do.  I thought a bachelor's degree was my window of opportunity to a higher paying job?  They've duped plenty of high school kids with that story because colleges are flooded.  But then post-graduation we realize what the job markets are like in the southeast.  We've been watching a lot of Seinfeld lately, and I've decided that their lives are like being in college.  Always coming over, doing nothing.  And the more I watch, the more I think Jerry Seinfeld and my favorite English professor, Todd Lidh, are alike.  I never realized this in school because I never watched Seinfeld, but I wish I had known.  It would have made Todd even funnier.  I guess that's everything for now.  Peace.  (The mood man is saying 'om'.)"

"event","I know this is silly, but I think it feels kind of special when you see things like a bright blue jay, or two fluffy-tailed rabbits hopping on the side of the road.  
Yesterday I had I think the first real conversation I've had with Houston my whole life.  It felt really good.  I wish all of this was over.  Who knows how long it will stretch out.  It's easier for her to do it that way, but it's agonizing for the rest of us.  I'm glad she's finally doing something for herself after all the years of putting us first.  Happy Mother's Day.
There's a lot that makes me happy.  I have more than my fair portion of joy, in small silly things like birds and rabbits.  Those things are my saving graces.  God knows that.  
Sean is also my saving grace.  I couldn't have a better roommate.  He'll make fun of me for being so sappy though."

"event","It's the beginning of summer, when the warm nights smell sweet and you can enjoy being outside.  Tonight big low clouds are rolling and you can hear thunder far away.  I think it's supposed to rain tonight for the first time in forever.  I just hope it's gone by tomorrow afternoon, because I'm going to the beach, finally.  Things are good most days, but maybe one day a week I can't stand under the pressure anymore and I kind of sit down under it.  Or fall down.  This afternoon was one of those.  I feel obligated to make my dad feel better, and when I can't I feel like I'm partly responsible for his feeling bad.  Nothing really makes this feeling go away.  Or allows me to enjoy being around him anymore.  This is a huge shame, as is most of this situation.  Maybe this is stuff I should reserve for my private journal at home, but maybe I want somebody to read it.  Anyway, I think I have to go get dinner ready.  I'll sit outside for a while and enjoy the weather.  Sorry I'm so emo.  (Sean, I put song lyrics in my subject line for you.)"

"event","Do you think it's illegal for someone to take a dog into Wal-Mart wearing a fake ""Dog in Service"" vest?  I don't think the vest was fake; I'm pretty sure this monstrous rottweiler wasn't trained to be a guide dog though.  His owner wasn't using the proper commands and kept referring to herself as Mommy.  That's not very professional.  Neither was his lying down on the job and chewing on his paw.  Anyway, I had a funny run-in with Mr. Johnson this afternoon after work.  He watches Chris, the kid who lives in the house in front of us.  When I slowed down to say hey to him he said, ""You look a little different today.  Yesterday you looked like a movie star, you were wearing diamond earrings or something.  You look a little different today.""  All I could do was laugh and tell him to have a good afternoon.  This coming from the man who Sean caught ""letting his water down"" with only his truck to block him from the street.  Oh well.  This isn't an informative update, necessarily.  You probably pretty much know what's going on and why my life is in a shambles.  Thank God for saving my peace of mind, most days.  He's the only possible way I could continue to have hope anymore.  I think I have more to say, but I'm not sure.  I thought I had another pretty good anecdote too, but I can't remember what it is now.  I hope this journal entry finds you well.  I'm going to brush my teeth and go to sleep.  This week's passing too slowly; I thought yesterday was Tuesday, and I feel like tomorrow's Friday."

Mandi, I apologize that I didn't call you.  I thought it would be more painful to know we were in the same town and couldn't get together than if you never knew at all.  I went over to see Sarah's brand new son, Tate.  He's thirteen days old and absolutely beautiful.  We had a wonderful time.  I wish we lived closer because I don't want to miss anything about his life.  I don't have much else to update on, that I can share with everyone who reads, anyway.  I've been stressed out about something that I never expected in a million years, and I don't know how to handle it.  Over the past couple of weeks I've grown used to feeling a collection of different emotions all in one day.  I'm ready for it to be over, but it's not practical to hope that.  I do have hope, although it probably looks like it's been attacked by a lion, if you could look at it.  I'm tired in many more ways than one.

"event","and when I was there the other day I noticed there's a lady working in the magazine section.  I don't like it when she's there; she's very invasive-- asking if you're looking for anything and slamming stacks of magazines loudly on the floor.  Doesn't she know the magazine section is just for browsing?  No, I'm not looking for anything; I just want to read the magazines in peace.

Also, I read this short article in our local Independent News last week:  ""Researcher Jean-Louis Martin of the Universite Claude Bernard in Lyon, France, found (for a December British Medical Journal article) that consuming cannabis (marijuana) doubled motorists' likelihood of a fatal auto collision, and alarming news headlines about the report followed.  Less prominently noted in the article, and consequently in news reports, was that drivers impaired by alcohol were <i>six</i> times more likely than an unimpaired driver to have a fatal collision, thus suggesting that the generally illegal drug, cannabis, is only one-third as dangerous for drivers as the legal drug, alcohol.""

Speaking of driving, or not, Friday and Saturday Sean and I bought speed bikes at the Helping Hand Mission.  They look like they're from the seventies.  We've taken spins around the neighborhood on them last night and this afternoon.  I'm hoping to work up to riding to and from work.  It's definitely close enough, and I think that would be amazing.  I'll keep you posted."

I need to make a to-do list of things so I can start marking stuff off.  I feel like when you get ready to pack to move someplace-  I have so much to do, and don't know where to start.  I start one thing, then remember something else and break off in the middle of the thing I'm doing to do what I remembered, and then I forget what I began doing and come back to it hours later.  that's what planning my wedding is like.  

last weekend mandi and kelsey threw me a beautiful shower. we ate outside in fern gully's backyard under the beautiful trees.  everything was perfect.  I think the best thing about having a shower thrown for you is feeling so special.  it's different from being given gifts on your birthday for some reason.  mandi and kelsey put so much time and work into my shower, and so many people showed up.  it's sobering and humbling to have everyone's care for you concentrated on you all at one time.  I felt silly for not realizing and appreciating what these women have done for my heart.  during all the introspection I've done trying to get ready to <i>get married</i>, I realized serious relationships are a collaboration of all the people you know.  sean and I don't need only each other; we need you too.  my thank you could never be big enough.

the weather makes me eager for buying a Christmas tree and putting up lights and popcorn and cranberries.  oh, and buying new sweaters.  I want to put lights on the outside of my apartment, but I think that's against my lease?  I'm not sure.  I wish you could come visit and help me decorate and put on Christmas music.  I want to put pictures of my place on here.  I can borrow your digital camera?  

this entry gets the emo eyes.  I think that's what happens when I'm bored and haven't updated in so long.  my thoughts are crammed together, and they turn into syrup-y goo.  I blame the weather, and my biological clock getting ready for the time change, when I'll have to get out of bed while it's still dark."

But at the very least, I finally got to go as Superman with the styrofoam molded muscles, which I've always wanted to do."

"event","Two good things happened tonight.  I got my next car payment -which isn't good- but I didn't get charged a late fee which I was expecting.  I also got my refund check from paying that jerk at Pop-a-Lock in St. Augustine.  Tomorrow after work I'm driving to Panama City to support the band as they play at FSU's BCM retreat.  I hope it's fun; I think it will be.  

OK.  Here's a playlist from Paul McCartney's perfect show last Saturday night (<a href=""http://livejournal.com/users/tuesdayiscoming/"">Mandi</a>, Paul's shirt makes me look prettier.  I wore it Wednesday night and got many compliments, not on the shirt itself but on how nice I looked):

I don't even have to say how amazing it was to be in the same room as Sir Paul McCartney, Beatle amazingextraordinaire.  I'm so happy we went, and consider it money very well spent.

I decided that night of Paul Day that life is made up of moments.  You cannot live in hope of the future, or in memories of the past.  What you have is this moment, right now, to enjoy.  I know this sounds said-before, but I think it's a verson of <i>carpe diem</i> in which, whatever it is, you should do it.

"event","As if I have to be reminded.  Today is Friday for me.  

Yesterday when I came home from work, the side yard had been mowed, all the leaves blown out of the carport, and the trash can moved to the street.  And my neighbor Monty is out of town.  I can only attribute this to my freaky landlord.  In the contract he says we can pay him some extra money for his guys to do yard work, but I didn't ask him to so I hope he doesn't try and charge me for it.

A couple of weekends ago (and I don't know how I forgot to write this), Sean, Ian and I were driving around downtown.  Underneath the interstate in a big field, a black man had parked his Mustang.  The door was open on the passenger's side and loud jazz music was blasting out.  This is the best part:  He had his shirt off, and was accompanying the jazz music with his own trumpet.  And he was pretty good.  I think he was wearing a cab driver hat too.  I wanted to meet him and talk with him, but how weird is that?  Walking up to someone playing their trumpet out in a field.  I think he wanted to be alone.

I should probably get to work.  This is kind of a nerdy plug, but tonight is the grand opening of an exhibit at the T.T. Wentworth Museum on women in Pensacola during the twenties and thirties.  I think it will be very interesting, and a friend of mine has been working on this project for a long time and is really proud of it.  On a different note, there will be a band called Luna Mantra playing at the <a href=""http://www.belmontartscenter.com"">Belmont Arts Center</a> tonight.  I think I'm going to miss it, which disappoints me, but I think you should go.  Cheers."

"event","I'm ready to open the windows and enjoy the smell and cool breeze of fall.  I smelled the change in season on Friday afternoon.  It was a tease, naturally.  But I'm so ready.  I've got to find something to make this Labor Day worthwhile.  It's slipping away.  I don't have any ideas.  Ice cream sounds good, though.  Maybe I'll go shopping for a duvet cover.  I know that doesn't sound fun to any of you.  Maybe you, Mandi.  I've been really missing you this week, MandiAlyssanneJoshKelseyKellyBecky.  I wish I was living with you in a big commune in Chattanooga.  Or a small commune, really.  

I don't have much worth updating.  This was fun:  Last weekend Sean, Allen and I enjoyed a cigar downtown, and after that we went to Krispy Kreme to sit at the bar and drink coffee and milk and eat donuts.  There was an old man sitting further down the bar, going through what looked like receipts jammed in his wallet and reading them aloud to himself.  After a while he started talking to us.  For a mental picture, he looked like the father from Big Fish.  He started to tell us stories about working in a port in Biloxi growing up, and about World War II.  Most of the stories had to do with liquor and how much he had on his ship in particular.  He told us not to mix liquor with Pepsi because it's not any good.  He must have talked for at least an hour.  He was cracking himself up, too.  I loved him.

(The man has a halo over his head, but I don't feel 'good' like that.  I feel good, comfortable, happy, content, pleased, like I should be lying in sweet grass and clover with my shoes off.  If that man's face looked like mine, his eyes would be closed and he would be smiling as if he were smiling in his sleep.)

John Steinbeck to Elizabeth Otis, Sag Harbor, January 3, 1957 ""(I think it is Jan. 3, pretty sure in fact.)""

I like interesting addresses; ones with personality, not ""Smith Street"" or anything.  I've lived at a couple of pretty good ones:  8151 Cayuga Trail, Sycamore View, #9 Leighcliff, Ponitz Parkway.  Now I have a new one, and it's pretty good:  1017 1/2 B DeVilliers Street.  Without a doubt, Sean and I have the best, most interesting place to live out of all our friends.  We don't own it like they own theirs, but somehow that feels even better.  It reminds me of Steinbeck's traveling and the expatriots living on the West Bank of Paris during the war.  Temperoray-ness feels good right now, because I don't necessarily want to settle in Pensacola for a long time.

I can move in right away, which is what I'm nervous about.  I've never wanted to live alone.  This is the first place we looked at, which is one less thing I have to drive around and worry about.  Thank goodness. 

I wasn't kidding earlier this week when I said I needed to unwind this weekend.  I don't know why.  Nothing has been particularly stressful or demanding.  I just want to relax and have a good time.  And not be at home.

It's kind of ridiculous to see two grown men having a conversation with their heads up a fireplace so they can look at the damper.  I heard on NPR yesterday that a 73-year-old man killed a leopard that was attacking him by pulling its tongue.  I want to know how he did that without losing his arm."

I also drank some peach flavored vodka, which tasted like the most awful medicine you can imagine being forced to take.  I also drank some raspberry flavored beer that was nice and smooth, but whose name I don't recall.  It sounds gross, but it didn't taste sweet or anything; it was just nice and amber.  Today Sean and I drove through Starbucks to use my gift card, but the girl in the window knew Sean, so she gave me my drink free.  She was super cool and I've only met her once.

I call the refrigerator at work the refrigerator of death, because that's what it smells like.  And yesterday Tina and I found out why.  I always bring my lunch and keep it in there, so I know that it smells awful.  Tina normally doesn't, but yesterday she did.  She opened it and smelled the death smell and we both exclaimed over how nauseating it was.  Well she had the courage to look around and try to figure out what was causing it.  I usually just close the door as fast as I can.  She spotted a tin foil package, and suspected it right away.  Upon opening it, we discovered a lump of <i>raw</i>, green, and <i>rotted</i> meat.  It belongs to the Mexicos.  This is why I've been saying that it would be worth it to send them to a food safety preparation class.  We're all going to get E. coli.

Javier was sweet enough to buy me a coke, though.  He buys Tina a diet coke every day.  Yesterday I was sitting back at her desk when he came in for lunch.  We hear him go into the kitchen and put a dollar in for Tina's diet coke.  Then he puts another dollar in and stands for a really long time, as though deciding what to get.  Finally he presses a button, and brings them both out to us.  While the yard manager Kenny is gone, Javier and all the amigos have been calling Tina <i>patron</i>, which means boss.  They're great."

I wanted to let you all know of a situation that, I think, demands our attention.  Currently in the country of Sudan, there are Arab Muslim militias, backed by the government, that are raping and killing African Christians and animists in the Darfur region of the country.  So far, about 100,000 are dead and at least 2 million have been displaced from their homes and villages.  Recently, the US Congress has officially called this situation a ""genocide.""  Officially calling a crisis by that name gives our country a legal responsiblity to stop it.  
 
A national campaign, called 100 Hours of Conscience, will begin on March 17 with a moment of silence at 3pm.  The following four days will be a time for national prayer and attention to be brought to the situation in Darfur.  The campaign is also encouraging people to write letters to President Bush and their members of Congress to enourage them to take action to stop the killing in Sudan and to help stablize the region.  Sample letters and mailing addresses for representatives can be found here.  For more information on what is happening in Sudan and what to do about it, go to www.savedarfur.org.
 
I would like to invite you to join me in prayer during these 100 hours and to write to our representatives in government.  Also, please feel free to forward this information to anyone else who may be interested in urging our leaders to stop this genocide.
 
Thank you,
Josh Reynolds

At work we use an operating system from 1989.  That should be enough said, but there's more.  When you open an order and then decide to close it without saving, you press F5, which brings up a message that says, ""Warning:  You have chosen to kill this order.  F5 to KILL.""  

Today I saw a person who was either a man dressed as a woman and not remotely trying to disguise his voice, or a woman whose hormones are sadly screwed up.  I think it was a man.  When a man dresses in drag, you expect him to be wearing heels and fishnets, right?  This guy was dressed as a middle age woman who wears denim shirts with potted flowers embroidered on them.  It was strange, and I think I had to deliberately not visibly react with my face when I heard him speak. 

Also today they had to fire Duke, one of the drivers who delivers our brick all over town.  He failed his drug test for using marijuana and cocaine.  This makes me really sad because Duke always made me smile, and was one of the last people I would suspect was doing drugs.  I missed seeing him at work already this afternoon."

I went to Mobile for Mardi Gras when Linsey was in town with Sean, John, Darren, and Monica.  It was so much fun.  We saw an afternoon parade in Pritchard, Alabama where we were definitely in the minority.  People kept asking us to take their picture or pictures of their babies, and one lady said we looked French.  When we told her we were actually Floridian, she said well, we are too white and we need to get tans.  I thought the night parade in Mobile was not as fun because we didn't get to talk to any interesting people, but it was pretty exciting.  I haven't developed my film yet so I don't know if I got any good shots, but Sean and John took a lot of really great pictures.  Hopefully I can share a couple of them if I can get copies on a <i>compact disc</i> (ahem).

A week ago I drove to Hotlanta to meet Josh, Becky, and Mandi for the year's best sledding trip.  We decided to call it our summer vacation instead because it was so hot.  We had a great time visiting Chatanooga, and we decided that  we all want to live there.  We went to the High Museum and saw a beautiful Van Gogh exhibit.  I picked up a few good CDs and a couple of good books while I was there.  Most of all I had a great time with hanging out with the pack.  There were a lot of hilarious details that I deliberately tried to remember, but I forget them now.

The day I drove home my car broke down in La Grange, Georgia.  My alternator was bad and sucked the living daylights out of my battery.  A really nice guy named Norman stopped to help me push my car out of the middle of the road.  He ended up offering to just change my alternator on the side of the road because it was too late in the day for any car place to take me.  My parents nearly had a heart attack when they found out I got in the car with him, but I ended up being blessed by the testimony of the way God has directed his life.  What was the most compelling about him was how he was concerned that I know the love of Christ and that God would always be real in my life.  I don't think I've heard anyone speak so strongly to me about <i>his</i> desire for God in <i>my</i> life, and he was a perfect stranger.  I hope there are many more honorable and godly men out there who will help a girl in her time of need.

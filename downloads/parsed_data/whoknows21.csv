"event","so well not much is new at all. im working like crazy, this smester hasnt started off that hot and well my birthday sucked! why you ask? because a lot of people forgot it except for cara, jessica, and a couple others but i really cant remember anyone else from high school remembering it. hell dave didnt even remember it. i at least text messaged him on his birthday. but shit happens right?? i hate being like this still. i hate being here! i wanna be some where else, seperate myself from all the reminders that are obviously never going to go away. nothing for me seems to ever gonna change. i keep on meeting guys that end up being great in the begining, but then bam it isnt what either of us thought it would be, either that or i just like the chase which makes me think i will never be able to settle down. but its wierd i never felt that way with dave i could have been with him forever. but there i go again. damnit i am sick of this. why is the memory of him still plaging me??? it isnt fair! nothing is fair right now. so to sum the past two months up for you here it is ... i am working like crazy, already falling behind in school but trying to catch up, i did nothing but work on my birthday and the majority of people forgot, my ""love"" life is no existent, and well im just figuring me out. i dont know what else to say or do so there it is. till the next time, hopfully ill have something new to write."

"event","so ok i am completely and utterly fed up with feeling like an extra wheel everywhere i go. i really need to find true friends. not these part time, when they feel like it friends or these friends who come around when they know i am upset just so they will feel better about themselves. it is all meaninglesss after a while when a pattern starts to be seen. i am just ready for school to start i think. who knows maybe this semester will be different and i will meet some people. i am def going to put myself out there more i think, well i prob wont go to the functions or anything but meet more people in my classes ya know. it prob wont work that way but i mean at least i can say at the end of the day i tried to meet people. i dont know i am just so lonly lately but not all at the same time. i am starting to think i am ment to be alone right now, and finaly accepting that is a huge step for me. but i do know i am tired of feeling like i realy dont have any friends, although for all i know that is part of me needing to be alone right now. i just hope it will all work out sooner then later."

"event","where to begin ...
 i am tired of feeling like i dont fit in or belong anywhere or with anyone. so this week when i went away with my family the trip was less the perfect and here is what i got from it: that growing up doesnt mean people become or have the capability to be a true friend to anyone cause all the adults really acted like a bunch of teenagers. arguing, talking behind people backs, it just really kinda sucks and really doesnt give me much hope. also i realized well that my heart is still taken, and well im thinking that is not a good thing. also i have been mega stressing about ever seeing dave at school in the fall. just the thought of maybe seeing him at school alone or with his gf just drives me crazy, it just doesnt seem right. how did we both end up transfering to the same school? can someone please tell me that? its either fate kicking in or my curse biting me in the ass yet again. so to go on with this, i saw daves aunt at wal-mart the other day and talked to her for a little bit. and it kills me cause she totally understands everything and knew it all before i ever said anything. like she could see right through me. its because she has been where i am right now and as comforting as it is, it is scary cause right now she doesnt wanna get married and she hasnt wanted to cause of her first love and i know i wanna get married and have a family but what if it never happens for me because of this first love that still consumes me. but its strange cause among all this i dont totally hate being single cause i get to have fun and hang out with people and i get to learn about myself and grow, realize the things ive done that are totally and completely stupid and dont ever wanna do again, concentrate on school and things are just so unpredicatable. but if you know me you know that i like things to be sorta predictable and well i dont know. so ok when i was taking to his aunt she was tellng me i just need to find someone who can make me forget about him, well she didnt say it exactly in those words but still, then she also made a comment that maybe things with get back together later, or something like that. i just have to not expect anything and not look for it. just have to let things happen which is something i am figuring out how to do. well i have been writing in this thing for a little bit now trying to figure out what to say and i think i did it. just one more thing, i just have to let fate take over and just do what is best for me be it alone, with someone new, or whatever. i dont know im just feel so alone sometimes."

"event","So lately i have felt that everyone is either talking about me, ganging up on me, or just plain against me. nothing ever is what it seems, no one is ever who they say they are or appear to be, and people seem to be out for one thing ... themselves. im really looking forward to going on vacation next week with my parents to niagra falls and canada. ive been there before but never on the canada side of the falls, i guess that is supposed to be beautiful. but i dont know ... so ive been looking into going abroad and i have a meeting with the advisor august 10th so i am looking forward to that. i came across a school in puerto rico that is cheap but then i came across a school in greece that would be a semester at sea!!! i dont know what is going to happen or if anything is going to come of it because when and if it comes down to actualy planning it i dont know if i could ever really go on a plane but i suppose if i am supposed to believe that things happen for a reason i suppose i really cant let fear stop me. that is one of my biggest things i let fear hold me back i need to figure out how to get over fears and let them drive me and push harder. i need to figure out how to stand up for myself. i am tired of being the extra or the new girl in the clique one week then gone the next. maybe i have such a hard time keep friends or what not because i really dont know who i am or where i belong. i really dont know where this is going, where is came from, or why i even started writing this. well for some reason i am wide awake and this sucks."

"event","so ok heres the deal, i am tired of having ""part-time"" friends, and/or friends that are only around when it is convienent for them. I am the type of person that will be there for anyone at any time and am willing to do anything for anyone, but is there a single person that i can say would do that for me? unfortunatly not. i call people and they are always busy or doing something. now i am not going to be bitter, or mad cause everyone else has shit to do but me but that doesnt mean i am going to continue doing everything i do for everyone or am willing to do. im tired of bending over backwards, and being used until a better thing comes along. so i am totally sick of working at jj's. the people there are just so shady it is crazy. everyone talks shit about everyone and then is all happy go lucky to the persons face. i wish i could do that but i just cant, i cant put things aside for the sack of work cause it just isnt real and i dont like being fake. so a couple weeks ago i went to ny to visit aj right and it was so good to him and his fam and his friends. so i decided to look into studying abroad a semester. i emailed one of the ladies at wsc who is incharge of it so i can get all the information i can on it before i get my heart set on it, and plus once i get the info i will probably chicken out like i do with everything. so i just do know what i want or what i want to say. i know i need to grow up, mature, find things out about myself but its just so hard to do when it seems like i dont have a single friend to help me along the way. i mean hell jamie came back from europe and everything and i didnt even get a phone call hello im back or even an im! everyone i know has made amazing friends at school and i havent made a single one. i guess its all cause i didnt wanna go away to school because of obvious set backs. to make things worse i swear i just keep on getting fatter and fatter and i just cant get thin again, and i think that is the worst thing in the entire world at this point! so yeah im miserable yet again and people as me why but its not even worth explaining cause everyone will just be like o im sorry and i dont want peoples pity i jsut want people to be honest with me and not fake. i want someone to be a real genuine fun and none of the fake part time bull shit, my friend one week hers the next, you know what i mean. it seems like everything goes in circles with me i just wish i could find the loop-hole to get out of it. i really dont know what else to say or what else to do. i guess i will just have to suck it up for now until i get out of college which sucks cause i dont wanna wait that long to begin being happy. well i am going away with my parents a week from tomorrow and im hoping that will be fun. i dont know it just seems like something is missing right now inside, but i just cant figure out if it is a boyfriend i am missing or myself?"

"event","so ive decided what i think, say, or do just doesnt matter. maybe its because i keep things bottled up and am more willing to help friends with their problems then i am willing to deal with my own. or maybe it is because i let people walk all over me and then am miserable after the fact cause i cant say for sure if anyone would do anything for me. i dont know what it is all i know is right now this stuff is getting old. i dont know why i feel the way i do or think what i do but it is how it is. last night i was told that i am the smartest dumb girl that this person knows. he told me that i do stupid shit and do what i do cause it is what is expected and it is easier to do what is expected then to do what it is i know is right. and sadly enough it is true, or so it seems. so today was the first fourth of july i didnt spend it with dave and well it sucked. i am miserable and all i wanna do is cry but i cant. i think i have cried all i can cry for him but that doesnt take away the pain. also i seem to be getting blown off a lot lately but of course i will never say anything cause it isnt my style, just take the time i can get with my friends when they wanna give it i guess. wow i sure am a pathetic excuse for a person. i dont stand up for myself, i am still upset becasue the first person i fell in love with fell out of love with me and in love with someone else, and well what else is there. so ok i am no longer working 70 hours a week cause i left the day care, but not after the director pulled me into the office and started yelling at me and accusing me of ridiculous stuff, but anyway at least i am out of there. so i just spent the last half hour or so looking at qoutes online trying to find the perfect one to express how i feel but you know what it was pointless cause i am not going to find a qoute to express all the upset, anger, resentment, and just confusion that i am feeling at this very moment. all i know is this is all getting old and i need to get away ..."

and well the guy situation is just not happening. i dont have anytime and the time i do have i just wanna hang out with my girls/boys and just have fun. but dont get me wrong i still want a boyfriend but this time just may be good for me, i am just waiting to see why ya know? 
right now i dont talk to anyone from high school and well it doesnt look like that is going to be changing anytime soon i guess we really grew apart. so i hate to admit it but i still think about dave everyday and well i know he is going to worcester state in the fall and it is going to kill me if i see him walking about with his girlfriend or even alone whatever. i dont know i am just really getting miserable again casue all i do is work and the lonliness is coming back but other people have bigger problems then i do so o well they are more important."

"event","Hey guys so it has been a while since i wrote here cause well everything has unfortunatly been the same and then it all hasnt. so ill start out at the begining ... the day before st. patricks day i got into a car accident during the storm so i called dave to tell him to drive safe but he isnt in the storm not even in new england. where was he? across the country in california with his girlfriend who he has cheated on. can you believe it?!?!?! so yeah then on st. patricks day (keep in mind i had to be into work at 430) i drank from 12 - 330 and then went into work for um lets see about 40 minutes maybe and then was asked to leave. i cried all night long with the love of my life Ashley B. the next morning i went to get my car looked out and found out it was a ""total loss"" which means my car is technically totaled. so then i drove down to work but luckily nothing happened and everything is cool down there. so that was the swift kick in the ass i needed to realize i cant let dave do this to me or any guy cause no one is worth my aggrivation or worth my tears. so ok then the next night i went to shabooms with cory, sarah, and megan had a blast and ended up seeing joe rossi (remember from high school) but anyway so his brother and i ended up hitting it off totally. and it was great all weekend. so then that brings me to today. everything has been going really well and last night he asked me to be his girlfriend and i was like yes, i mean why not he treats me amazing, does nothing but compliment and always makes me smile!!!! and here i am now just a day later and ill start at the begining. i decided to hang out with him this afternoon cause i did my homework and i am going out again with sarah and cory and i mean i figured balance it out ya know what i mean. also because i planned on hanging out with justin this afternoon to see his sisters play, which fell through but anyway. i left anthony's house to go see justin and he wasnt even home when i called so i ended up just coming home. i then called anthony to tell him and his brother told me he stormed out of the house. no why would he be mad? a) i wouldnt do anything more then kiss, b) i was going to hang out with justin, or c) hes just a guy. well i dont know but all i know is when i asked him what he was doing tonight he was all mysterious like ""i may be taking someone out"" and i was like ""someone who?"" but o well right i dont need to know anything. so yeah ok he just called me and was like ""i just went to the store i didnt storm out or anything"". so ok whatever i guess that is that. but still i am not going to put all my eggs in the basket with this one so soon. ive learned my lesson and i dont think i would really put my eggs in one basket with anyone right now but i would love for it to work out with him but i just hope we can keep things slow. o well whatever. i miss my friends though out in boston. cara!!!!!!!!!!!!!! well i dont know. now i am kinda cooled down that he called and told me that but still whatever. i am still going to be ""prude"" only i am not going to feel bad about it cause if it doesnt feel right it doesnt feel right. hey guess what, maybe this is my finally growing up. ... who knowsbut on a brighter note among all of this i got a new car!!! i am doing all the insurance stuff tomorrow and i realy should have it by tomorrow or well realizticly probably next week but in time to go to NY to see AJ!!!!! well ok thats enough for right now hope you enjoyed the catch up"

"event","so ok its friday night or early saturday morning and i am here with my stomach in knots and horrible images in my head and feeling so alone. i was laying in my bed and it dawned on me that i was laying all the way to the right side of my bed and i thought about it and i have been doing that a lot lately cause well i am used to the other side being filled by well dave. this sucks, i thought it was supposed to get easier. instead i think about him and his girlfriend hooking up and wow does it hurt. i just dont understand what he is doing, but maybe there is nothing really to understand. when i closed my eyes earlier i just pictured me going out to his house and being with him. being in his arms, these dreams/thoughts need to stop happening. they are eating me up alive!! and o m g so badly do i wanna call him right now but i cant, it will only hurt more and it is nights like this one when i have to be the strongest even if i dont wanna be. and then there is that whole thing with bs, he hasnt returned my call or called me on his own. its like i thought he was an adult?!?! but aparently he is nothing special, but just like every other guy i meet. wow i just dont know what to do with myself and all these feelings. i have so much to offer people and why am i alone? is it because i am to giving, or is it just because i am to damn blind and shallow to see a great thing in front of me? damn i dont know. lately all i seem to be able to listen to is the michelle branch cd, hotel paper, cause all the songs like touch me in some way. i can relate them all to dave and well i wont qoute any of them or anything but its just wierd how it seems like on this cd she expressed everything i am feeling and all the longing and desire i have to be with him. is so strange to think about him being intamit with someone else, another girl being in his room, with his family. i cant stand it!! but damn what the hell is my problem??!!?!? he obviously doesnt deserve all i have to offer or am willing to give him considering he doesnt even want me. why am i hung up on someone that doesnt want me? ill tell you why cause i still want to be with him forever!!!!!!! its crazy. but also maybe i just truly havent met the right guy yet. but damn this is just so hard. its scary how easily i fall in love but just cant fall out of it. some people are just so lucky in love but i guess right now just isnt my time. i hate how it is always eating me up inside though. during the days i am fine, i have a smile on my face and a bounce in my step but at nights damn when no one is around and i have nothing to do but lay in my room and think about everything we once had and shared it just sucks. especially knowing i am the only one feeling like this. so april second to the fourth i am going down to ny to visit aj so i do have something to look forward to. why does nothing ever work out for me the way i want it to. i liked it better when i was a little girl and all i needed to do was smile and ask my dad for anything and i would always get it. why couldnt things stay that simple forever?"

"event","so ok lately it just seems like everyone i know is passing me by. i have friends getting engaged, friends traveling to europe either right now or in the near future, friends making new friends and exploring new things and places and where am i? in worcester. boring old drama filled worcester. i try to stay away from drama but it is like i find it everywhere i go. expectially when it comes to my feelings. its like i am in love with someone who doesnt even think about me, i had a crush on someone who didnt even think about me cause he is in love with someone else, wasnt interested romantically in someone who could have given me the world, and its like i am just never satisfied until everything goes my way. but i know things cant go my way all the time and all that jazz but its like if i am not 100% happy i just dont wanna settle. so lately i have been thinking a lot about marriage and kids and junk cause it seems like i have my school in order right now which is great for once. but i am just so scared that getting engaged, planning a wedding, and having kids just wont happen for me when that is all i wont more the anything in this entire world. so i thought i wasnt afraid of being alone anymore but i guess i am. i just wish i could meet that guy that makes me forget about everything else, that would be amazing, or hell even a guy that isnt either all about sex or in love with someone else. i mean that is like my life story. i just dont know what to do. everyone keeps on saying it will come when you least expect it but what do i do until that if that is true. how do i deal with the lonely nights when i lay in bed thinking about how i have been hurt and why i was lied to. its nights like these that just make me wish i had someone to hold me, kiss my forehead and tell me everything will be ok. i just dont wanna be left behind, but it is already happening. i mean i havent seen dave in over a month and a half and he doesnt give a flying fuck cause he is busy with his own shit which is understandable but it still doesnt take the pain away. and i have made a fool of myself the past few weeks calling him and crying to him. i suppose i am mainly confused as to why guys go for girls who dont want them, but then i can turn that around and ask myself that same question and well if i dont know why would anyone else. sleeping has become hard again. for a while it came so easily but lately i have been napping again and staying up to the early hours just thinking, tossing and turning, and trying to bore myself to sleep with a book but i end up getting my homework done instead, which is a plus but still. everyone things i am so stupid for still feeling the way i do about dave, and falling for the guys that i fall for but it isnt like i can control it and turn this shit on and off. also i have found myself treating guys like the way i have been treated in the past, which i dont know if that is a good thing or a bad thing but i have already hurt one person and well that wasnt a good feeling. but right now it seems like the only way to protect myself since i am just so messed up. it just all comes down to this, i am afraid of being alone and getting left behind."

"event","so ok two of my friends on engaged, i am single and right now feeling very alone. dont get me wrong i am so happy for both of them cause they are so deserving and just so lucky. but yeah so i keep on falling for these guys that just arent right for me lets put it that way and i let all the good ones go. why? and why more so then anything in the world, in the past 3 weeks, find myself almost falling in love with dave all over again? i mean come on we are over, he is over me and probably doesnt want anything i want anymore. i guess my time will either never come or i have to wait a long time. its like i have gotten stronger, more independent, confident and i have grown up and matured but now i just seems like something is missing sometimes. i want so must to be able to love dave again or for him to love me rather and it isnt like i am not over it like i am ready to date and move on but right now i am just kinda focusing on my school work, work, and most importantly friends. but they are all in boston so i really only have a couple people around here and they are always busy or with their bf's. i am just so frustrated lately i guess. i am really lonely and it is starting to hit again really hard. i wanna feel it again, i wanna be loved and love. i wanna be somebodys someone. i dont know whatever. i have to work in the morning"

"event","Ok, it's is no 5:12 a.m. and i am awake, still! i fell asleep from around 11:30 until 1:30 and i have been up ever since. this is going to kill me. i listened to music and it put me to sleep the first time tonight, then i tried staring at the cieling but then i started to get consumed by my thoughts, then i tried boring myself to sleep with history and if you can believe it that didnt even work! so now here i am all my reading is done for my classes and i am consumed with my thoughts and discomfort. i have listened to the same songs for the past like year and a half it is crazy. i pick the songs i like and they stick but i suppose that is a good thing cause it gives me something to enjoy to some extent. but yeah back to why i cant sleep. well to be honest i dont really know why this is happening again but lately the hurt feeling has come back and i miss dave so much. i listen to songs that used to remind me of him and i and instead of getting upset i get a warm feeling of comfort which is odd cause they dont mean anything anymore. and well everything with this justin kid is just crazy. i do favors for him left and right i mean hell i lent him 50 bucks the other day no questions asked, i just hope i get it back else that just may be the last selfless thing i do ... yeah right! but yeah so he called me from his ex-girlfriends house just to prove to her that i wouldnt get mad cause she called him out on it and said i would, but seriously am i 12 years old? why would i care? one) we arent together and two) he can do what he wants as long as he is honest about it but even so we arent together so really he doesnt need to tell me shit i suppose but i am really glad he does, but anyway. so work yeah that is going fine i am not making as much money as i would like but business seems to be picking up so hopefully soon i will make the money i want to make. so today i found another thing that makes me upset, how can someone tell you that they want to be with you (even if you understandably turn them down) then the next day be all about another girl and ready to love? so does that mean that if i had been like yeah lets give it a shot i wouldnt have had all of you and a part of you would have been with this new crush? that just doesnt seem right but i guess that is me. i swear i really have a distorted image of what people and the world should be, HONEST! haha that is kinda crazy if you think about it. but i got an a- in my photography class that i took during the intersession, its just to bad that i dont get the grade to help my gpa and i only get the credits, but whatever i am having high hopes for this semester. tonight i didnt straighten my hair for the first time in weeks and it was the curliest it has seriously ever been! and it really seems healthier, who would have thought using a heat activated conditioner before and during the straightening process would actually do something. so yeah i am worried about my buddy aj, i wish there was something i could do for him but ya know what he is in ny and i am here so i mean there isnt really anything i can do except give him my support and love, YOU'D BETTER REALIZE YOU HAVE IT TOO!!!!!!! hehe but yeah. another thing that sucks is getting close to the people in the family of the guy you like. justins sister and lil brother are the coolest! like i talked to her about girly stuff that she wanted to talk about, helped her with her homework it was great. i wish i had a lil sister or even a younger brother to just play with and run around with that is like 14 years younger then me. hehe, wow i have no idea about anything. but like i said before at some point it is ok. i remember last year or even just a few months ago that if i felt like if i didnt know what was going on or what was happening i would have started seriously freaking out and acting like a 3 year old so i suppose with this very moment i can truly see the growth i have made recently in myself. so maybe this whole thing is a true blessing in discize. how am i going to make it through today!!!??? i need to stay awake in my classes and i have to work. so i guess from 130 until 330 i am hopefully going to sleep but i dont know maybe i shouldnt so i am exhausted come night time. who knwos i guess we'll just see what happens. so in the past like 5 days i have gotten burnt three times and at least one is going to leave a scar because of my pure stupidity of letting people piss me off. hopefully the other two will just fade away. my room is such a mess! well i dont really know what else i wanna write about ..."

"event","so lately i have been realizing that maybe knowing what the future is going to be like isnt what i want. i used to always say how i wanted a crystal ball but now i realize where would the excitment be? i mean this photography class is turning out really good actually and i will def get the credits and i actually met someone and we are seeing eachother i guess nothing has been said or anything but nonetheless i never thought would happen for me, but i finally realized i cant stop my life or put it on hold. i have to let go. i cant let fear hold me back i have to let fear drive me. i sitll love dave, i wish we talked more but right now he needs time to figure things out with his own life, no distractions. i dont know what is going to happen. i do know that the way i am feeling right now is when i usually push someone away who isnt dave but i cant anymore. i have to embrace it and go back to what dave and i said, if it is meant to be it is meant to be, and whatever he and i do now with other people, alone, or together it wont effect what lies ahead of us when it comes to fate and/or destiny. but right now i am figuring things out for myself, living life for me, and seeing where each day will take me. jj'orourkes is going really well. the people are wicked nice so that should be good. but next semester is going to be crazy! between my 6 classes and working i am not going to have a life! but anyway, i guess everything comes down to not knowing the future but also not wanting to forget or leave behind the past. but its like i said before, for right now it is time to let go and venture out from behind my fear and let the leaves land where they may."

"event","i can't hide how i feel it doesnt do me any good so here goes. all that is going on in my life with guys is just so confusing and sucking ass right now. can you imagine how hard it is to sit back and watch the man you love being with and being happy with another women? well i can. i wish i were still the jealus type who would call him just to yell at him and find out what he is doing every second and all that jazz but instead i have grown into someone who respects and puts others infront of myself. i will let him be happy, not interfer with him and her. they need to be together now and who knows for how long a week, a month, forever, who the hell knows. now as much as i respect him and love him enough to just let him be happy that doesnt mean it still isnt eating me up inside. and i now truly know how he felt last year when he had to picture me with other guys i now have to do the same for him only this time he has real strong feelings for her, and not for me anymore. o fuck it, it more then hurts it fucking kills. one last thing that sucks in this entire world is that i cant turn the the person i love to take all this away. as bad as all this is i think it is also a blessing in discize because it is helping me grow up and mature, i just wish it could have happened in a different way. and i only know this cause my buddy cara said that to me yesturday that in like three months she has seen me change and mature which did make me feel good. but anyway. what else is there to say. ill probably return to this topic again to help heal so ill end it here for right now."

"event","hi everyone, its me again here to bitch and moan about the things i think and feel. i called dave this morning to say hi see how things were going asked him what he was up to and to make this long story short amandas voice was in the background and they are together. everything i have said is true i just want him to be happy. i am not jealus or wanna like kill her or anything like that it is just a double edged sword. cause as much as i am happy things are turning around for him and he sounded so chipper and happy on the phone it still hurts so much that he doesnt love me anymore or care anymore. its like that song ""i'll never get over you getting over me"". why do i screw myself over? why am i so afraid of being volnuerable with other guys emotionally? its like i want him to be happy but i want myself to be alone and miserable? it just doesnt make sense. and his mom knows so i guess it is real. i am so tired of crying but its like i am to afraid to do anything to make myself happy cause i cant get that picture out of my head that he drew at papa ginos a couple years ago and all the stuff that we talked about. and it isnt even like i cant be happy its just every guy i think maybe i could be happy with is either like wicked far away, or the second everything about being together and stuff can come true i get scared and pull away. its like i can think how great something could be, but the second it all can come true i start nit-picking and pulling away like woah and pretty much being a totally bitch but i dont mean to. ""the first cut is the deepest"" says sheryl crow and that is so true. and its wierd like i can let go physically unfortunatly i cant let go emotionally which is totally contradictory but nothing i can do about it. nothing else i can say really, until i let go emotinoally and stop being afraid i am simply just fucked."

"event","i have been so strong the last few days, and have been having so much fun which is why i love my friends. i got a job that i start training for next week and things were starting to look up, until tonight. i watch white oleander which was a great movie by the way. must have been one of the greatest movies i have seen in a while. but then i rolled over onto my stomach and closed my eyes, but realized it wasnt going to work. i was not ready to sleep cause my thoughts and my emotions would keep me awake. and of course the thoughts that consumed me were about dave. and i dont know why, he used me (or so it felt), told me things just to tell them to me, and just doesnt love me anymore and hasnt for a while but it still kills. and trying to hide it with a smile is just so draining cause i may be fine during the day but it eats away at me and keeps me up at night. but i am sure you are asking yourself why would i care about someone who i think has lied to me and hurt me so badly? well its because i still care. and after reading his profile right now how is it possible for me not to care. but most importantly how is it possible for me to be crying a little right now because i am worried that he may not be ok and that all i want to do is tell him everything will be ok, wipe away all the tears if any, fight off all the bad things going on in his life for him, and give him whatever makes him happy even if it is another girl. how can i be so selfless even though it hurts me so badly and i dont get it in return? how is it possible for a person to care so much, and yet be so angry and hurt but still care only about that persons happiness???? right now i am in ashleys kitchen while she is asleep and for some reason i feel really comfortable here in the dark alone with my thoughts and emotions. i think it is because i am finally able to own them and call them mine. everything i think and feel is legitamite and worth every breath even if not to anyone else. this is me, volnuerable, weak, strong, happy, unhappy; i am feeling every emotion right now. i am feeling so free cause i am able to express all this without a care cause this is how i feel and right now and as it should be always i need to be the most important person to and for myself. i have no one holding my hand guiding me through these hard times. i have no one giving me advice about how i should do things, which way i should turn, or anything like that. i am the most independent right now then i have ever been which is a great feeling but also scary all in the same. i dont wanna go to bed cause i am afraid i wont fall asleep, i dont want today to come cause i know how my thoughts will consume every waking minute of the day. i hate to admit all this cause i am afraid of what people will think, or how people will react to it but i cant be afraid of people anymore. i cant be afraid that people will laugh at me because of my failures or my misfortunes. i cant worry about what other people are thinking because in the end i am looking back at myself in that mirror and through the memories and my opinion is the only one that matters. i may have fought for somethings and fell miserably but you know what, how many people can say that they did all i did for a great love and passion i felt at one point in my very young life? not to mention at one time i had two great passions. unfortunatly for me at some point they both had to end. but every begining comes from another beginings end so i dont know what is going to happen, or who i will be with, or what i will be all, i know is i want to be happy even if it is just knowing everyone else i love and care about are happy. so i end this with one last tear in hope of brighter days, they wont come over night or even in a week or a month but they are out there. and this time i truly hope i will not let them pass me by."

"event","so tonight was a holiday party with people from high school and to tell ya the truth i was scared about going cause i hadnt seen these people for at least a year and they all have grown together and i have been pushed out in a way. and i was right. there was no point in me going cause all i felt was that i was being judged. i dont know what it was but i have just grown apart from them. our tastes are just all so different now. they are all in boston and i am here. all i can say is none of them know me and the thing that pisses me off is that they think they do and when they think rachel they automatically associate me with sex and sexual frustration. you know i made some serious mistakes last year and one of the mistakes was telling my ""friends"" about what happened. i am not proud of the stuff i did but i cant change it and there is no point in even thinking about it. it is all in the past, it doesnt define me and well if you dont know that then you have no idea who i am, or what i am capable of. there is only one person and well i dont even know if that is true anymore. i am growing up, i have learned from my mistakes, and i have seen people for what they truly are. i am not saying i am perfect or above anyone but atleast i am honest and trying to be true to myself. you know the happiest i have been in a while was last weekend when i was in levittown with AJ and all his friends cause none of them knew me or could judge me from my mistakes i have made, or the past couple times that i have hung out with dave and i could be myself. i just hate all these lies, and fake ways people act around others. i could see it in your eyes that you were judging me the entire night! and i know that for some reason you think me and your brother would be a mistake but are you seriously going to say that about me cause of my past and not even have the curtiousy to say it to my face? he and i are just friends anyway thats how we act with eachother it has never gone any further then a long hug or stupid sexual comments. but what really pisses me off is that you dont think i am good enough for him. yes i made some mistakes but i think one of the biggest mistakes i ever made was trusting anyone. everyone in my life has hurt me in some way or another. so then why do i still trust? why do i still have faith and believe what i want can still come true? why do i want to believe everything dave said to me last night and this afternoon? you know, i have no idea what is going on but i am about ready to just bury myself in school and if i get a job work and never ever look back. but we all know i cant do that. i hate the things i have done, but they were mistakes and i shouldnt be judged by them no matter what. but i suppose the only way you would knwo that is if you truly know me. but i dont even know if i do. AJ and Mike are coming down january 10th for like 2 days that is going to be so much fun. i am just tired of being labeled and giving so much to people who would never do the same for me."

"event","so last night and this morning i hung out with him and it was so much fun. we laughed, talked, goofed around, and i finally felt like i could be myself around him. goofy and just playful regardless if he thinks it is retarded or not and that was a good feeling. it seemed so real and it is what i want, but is what he said to me true? i am so confused. i so want it to be and i want to clig to the idea of him and i again but how will i know? his kisses still feel amazing and being with him is still what i see in the future. but why do i think it is just in the moment and it is just because he has nothing else to do? then there are other people invading my thoughts but im sorry to say he still beats them all no matter what. i wish it werent this way, i just wish i knew what was true and what is worth it all. he said to me he oculd give me 100% commitment but why did he say that now? i want to believe it but i need to see it and if it is all true hopfully he will prove it to me. but if this is just another mind game then wow it is pure cruel. my mind and my heart are out of synch right now. i just feel like i am constantly wanting the things i cant have or the things that will give me the greatest challenge, why cant anything come easy or not be a challenge and just be real, and pure? but its like what was said last night, what is meant to be will be and no matter what we do now it wont change what is meant to happen. i cant say i dont know what i feel or i dont know what i want, i do i just dont want to hurt anyone in the process or get hurt again by being mislead. but i guess it all comes down to this. if he is true then i hope he is pure enough now that he will prove it to me what it is he really want, he says he knows what he is missing lets just hope in the end of all this we both have whatever it is we want. there is just so much i can say right now. i am so scared, and confused. i am scared of being mislead, i am scared of repeating the cycle, and i am confused about all that has been said. but then again if what he said about last night was true then i suppose today it all meant nothing. happy holidays everything maybe they will bring a little joy to everyone."

"event","This weekend was amazing! I got to see AJ finally after 6 years and it was great finally putting a new person pretty much to the past year and a half or so of talking and trying to get together. and his friends were amazing, they had a dance off in the parking lot of apple bees, hilarious!! his band (the product of the '80s) was sooo good i was blown away. his family was great, just everything was so surreal for me this weekend. i hadnt been that care free is a long time. i didnt have any drama and that just made me not wanna leave ever. it just sucks that we are so far away, but hopefully AJ and his singer Mike will be coming down in january for a weekend. it would mean so much to andrea and me. what else can i say besides how comfortable it was out there. we went in the hot tub, so nice i want one, and we just lounged around and watch tv until like 1am just relaxing on eachother, it was a great time. but now i am back and i dont know how i feel about that. on friday i got a voice message from dave and well i dont know how i should take it so well i guess it was just in the moment but even so it was good to hear. so right now i am just kinda here with my thoughts and this computer."

"event","so tonight i learned a very valuable lesson ... never speculate or assume what you would do in certain situations because unless you are actually faced with them you will never be able to give a true answer. i mean you can say one thing when you arent faced with it cause it is easy and you never actually think it will happen to you."

"event","Well today i ventured out into the real world with andrea and we went christmas shopping for artur. and well i realized why i havent been going out lately, or a lot anyway well its because i am dreading the holidays and everythign they bring. we were in the mall today in filense and you wanna know something pathetic from downstairs i swore i could smell the cologne i bought him from two years ago and thats what made me realized everything and i started to cry. yea i know pathetic or whatever think what you must but this is how i feel. so after that i started thinking about the christmas i spent at his house and the first valentines day we were together, they were amazing times. i just wish i could move on as easily and smoothly as he has. but like i always say as long as he is happy, my time will eventually come, or so they say. well yeah so i hate the holidays and the new year coming up it just doesnt look all that promising. all i know is i cant wait to go away this weekend. cara said it today and i hope it is true, spring will bring good things. and whats another few months of this right?"

"event","ok somethings just need to be let out they are building up inside and i am tired of being lied to or given the run around. i just dont get this stupid male lying bullshit. one of the main reasons we broke up was because you didnt have enough time, but it is hilarious that you have had tons of time to make a ""good friend"". and the thing that kills me is it just doesnt make sense. if you dont want me you dont want me, cause in that case you dont deserve me if you are going to lie. if you dont love me, then again you never deserved any of my love, time, energy that i gave or hell am still giving! how is it whenever we break up someone is right there around the corner, did you like prep for this each time it happened? i am so angry right now, i have a final in like seven hours and i cant sleep. none of this makes sense. were you scared? did things just change? i just want the truth. i dont know what it will do, probably only kill me even more then i already feel but like i always say it is better to know then not, for me ignorance is not bliss. it just seems so selfish to me all that you have done and said. and for me to still have feelings for you, for me to still think i am in love with a person who could make me cry as much as you did, or put me through as much confusion and pain as you did is crazy to me. but i cant deny it. i dont know if this is all meant to happen so i can find true love in someone else, or inevitably to end up with you by helping you see the true picture and what you are capable of but i dont even know if you deserve it. by me thinking i still love you and want to be with you is that taking the easy way out? i dont know what is going on, i dont know if any of this has a point, i dont know if any of this is worth it, or anything about this at all. i do know it hurts though. i am tired of hurting. i am tired of not being able to trust anyone. i am tired of feeling miserable all the time even when i have a fake smile on. and let me tell you that fake smile is very draining to put out there sometimes it makes the pain all that worse. i once thought that if you faked it long enough it would come true but yet again i found myself to be wrong. but i still dont think i am wrong about you WHY?!!?!? everyone gives me so many compliments that are genuine but i dont believe them i want to so desperatly but i am not capable of it cause i dont feel it. i want so much to trust people, but as i have seen no ones intentions are ever pure. i just seems that i am going in circles basically wanting to get back to the begining of each circle which is with you. but i know you are not what i need. i gave way to much, did way to much for you, but i never felt that at the time cause i loved you. i never thought i could do or give to much but i guess i was wrong. i am tired of wanting you, i am tired of loving you, i am tired of thinking about everything amazing we had, i am tired of telling people i never wanna feel again what that is all i wanna do is feel the love you once gave me even though i know it could have been better. you took advantage of me. everything i had to offer, everything i gave. i hear a song i think of you, hell you keep me up at night and i mean nothing to you. how is it possible for it to all work out this way? right now it just seems that everything bad that can happen to me will and it is just getting pretty damn hard to see otherwise. and i know even if i go to bed right now i am not going to be able to sleep or even if i do i will wake up from one of my nightmares or dreams that i have been having lately and in most of them i am either lost, or lose something. figure that one out. so i think i am finally getting angry but we all know how it is impossible for me to stay angry. i dont know what is in store for me, no one does, i just hope that if it is worse then this all of this will only make me stronger and give me the ability to make it through."

"event","ok you dont understand. cause if you understood then you wouldnt feel like you have to keep telling me you do. and yes that comment was nice but it isnt what i need to hear all the time. i have told you this before. stop trying to convince me, actions speak louder then words. i of all people know this. one of the things i have learned through all this. you can tell someone you love them, or they can tell you, you can tell someone you trust them or they can tell you but it means jack shit unless you prove it to them through your actions. i am just so sick of trying to explain myself why does everything have to be so damn difficult. i hate how i am feeling lately i just want all these emotions to go away. i would give anything in the world to never feel again. cause all it gets me is more pain and heartache. guys can be so cruel when they want to be. when they know they have you, well fuck that. no guy has me and no guys deserves the shit i would do for them. not a single one! and if you dont like this sorry but this is me, real and uncut. i am all about being honest and not talking shit and being genuine and at times i feel like the biggest hypercrit but at others i feel like i am the only genuine person around me. everyone says they are genuine but then i hear shit it is like fine whatever ill believe you it isnt like it makes a difference even if you are lying out of your ass. people are just so fucked up. everyone else is out for themselves why the hell cant i be. well maybe this is my trying to find me, and be out for myself cause i am tired of being everyones everything! it gets me nothing and isnt that what life is about, what you get in return? yea well i mine as well jump on the band wagon right, it isnt like i am getting anything good out of it at this point. lately there seems to be only one real person in my life and she is bunches of miles away and the only person i wanna be with like all the freaking time. cara, you are seriously my backbone right now thank you so much! but seriously stop trying to convince people how you feel through words, words are empty meaningless forms of expression. show the people you love you love them, the people you hate you hate them and so on. people deserve the truth, and i sure as hell dont deserve the be lied to or anything less then what i want and most of all i shouldnt feel bad for not wanting something, i need to be honest to stay true to myself and who knows maybe find happiness in it. so here is what i need qouted from the beautiful britany spear ... I need time, I need space ... I need me!"

T to the ylor aka T to the loser, lol harsh i know. the laughter never stopped!! but i dont know not much else to say about it. blah besides the fact today i am exhausted. o and how good was that drink that i invented!! lol everyone should try, peach-tree, vodka, green-apple smuckers and cranberry juice SO GOOD, GOES DOWN LIKE BUTTA! LOL 
but on a more serious note, i finally decided right now i do need to be ""alone"". i am not emotionally ready for anything and i finally decided that is ok. it is ok to admit your faults, or flaws and at times admit you were wrong. but i dont have to like though. but yeah these past few weeks have been really good for me i dont know why though. i have spent a lot of time with myself which is something i never could have done without freaking out or crying or something. i have been absorbing a lot, observing a lot, and learning a lot. things can only get better from here. 
so next week the semester is officially over, i cant believe how fast it went, but all i know is that best way to start off a winter break is to go to long island!!!! woohoo, andrea i cant wait to get away for a weekend. i am so damn excited! well i dont know what is in store for this weekend. prob nothing all that exciting but who knows there seems to be something interesting behind every corner lately."

I GET TO SEE AJ!!!!!!!! andrea and i are going to go visit him, see his band! i am so excited i havent seen him since i was 13. it sure is going to be a blast from the past with a twist. lets just hope nothing happens to stop us from going so i am keeping my fingers crossed but as of now the trip is a go!!!! 
well classes are done and all i have are two finals to take next week they shouldnt be bad i just cant believe this semseter is already over. but next semester is going to be hectic but hopfully all goes well."

"event","So ok i talked to my biology professor today to ask about my grade and the paper. and i felt like i was failing the class which is part of the reason i have been sleeping like shit lately and you know what he told me? with kind of a chckle he goes ""no, you havea c+, a 77"". now granted that isnt great by any stretch of the means but i mean a high c is biology for me?!! i was pleasently surprised :o). then when we spoke about my paper i told him all the trouble i had been having and you gave me all the information i am going to need to rewrite this paper!!! how amazing was that i was dumb founded! i am so appreciative for that and after he handed them to be at first i was confused then he goes ""i look forward to reading your paper"". so now i just have to write a kick ass paper tonight, but no pressure. 
so last night i was watching average go and got really really emotional and upset so i caved and asked him a couple questions i really shouldnt have, i realize now that they came out in a moment of weakness and i am total dumbass for doing this to myself. i just cant admit to myself that i was wrong about him and i. but i guess start realizing things dont always turn out as you plan on them to and that it is possible for me to be wrong about things and people arent laughing at me. all i know is i really wanna go to ny to see AJ. i havent seen him since i was 13!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i really hope that this time around andrea and i do get to go visit him and maybe see his band play but every time she and i wanna go it never works out. but i'll keep my fingers crossed. 
another thing is that i really need a job! like i am talking i am starting to get down to my last dollars which isnt a good feeling. well ok enough is enough i need to have myself some fun! bye"

"event","so ok i cant sleep. i dont know why i am just not tired. could it be because i am worried yet again? yeah thats it. so one of my friends got sick tonight and ended up going to the hospital to get checked out i think, i hope she is ok but im sure she just fine. and well earlier today i got an im from him while i was in the shower today i responded hi but after thinking about it he would never say ""we should meet up"" and if he had he would have responded back even when he got home from work, so the mystery is was it him? i guess i wont know cause well i dont know what is going on. i was worried about him last night and he never got back to me then i called him this morning and i caught him but i woke him up so he was all groggy and well you know how groggy people sound (sorry). but anyway cant change what is done, but why do i feel so bad about worrying and caring? it sucks cause i cant sleep right now and i wanna turn to him but i cant. this whole not knowing and wanting to know thing sucks, tell me how do you turn it all off?"

"event","so ok we all know it snowed today and the roads were bad as hell!!!!! so of course what am i doing, worrying about people i care about because they have to drive on these unpaved, unsafe roads. but why do i care? this is bullshit. i get myself worked up about something i no longer have any reason for knowing, it can be argued too that i never really did to begin with. but i cant control it. i thought things were going to be looking up but you know what as much as they are, they are still going to suck knowing he may be with someone else i just wish i knew for sure if he was or wasnt. but again that is the thing there no reason i should know, it isnt my business, so then i ask why do i want it to be? i guess i am just fucked and that is how it is going to be for a while. i need to continue on the path i am starting to pave for myself but its just sometimes i wish i didnt have to pave it alone, i really thought youd be at my side forever. and there my friends is how niave a girl can be."

"event","hey, so ok this entry isnt meant to make anyone feel bad but if it does that i suppose you have something to feel bad about. ok so someone disappointed me tonight, a great guy who is always smiling and is able to make anyone laugh and brighten up the worst of days. a guy who had me convinced he was not like the ""other"" guys but i found out otherwise. why do guys lie? that is my main question. as i write this i am sitting here kinda smug considering i was sadly correct about all guys being the same. they all lie when they think they are going to make someone else jealus or upset. but did any guy ever sit down and think to themselves that maybe girlfriends got jealus because you lie!!!! lies are not a causation of jealusy, it is the other way around but why does no one else see that? now a wonderful person is thinking very low about herself and i hope she doesnt do anything rash. she is an amazing girl and should never think bad things about herself but right now she is because of a lie. so you know what to any guy that lies about the smallest thing, you are a coward. and i am not meaning this as an insult just as hopefully some insight into how lies really make nothing better and the truth in a relationship now matter how much you feel it will hurt your partner always will make you the relationship stronger cause trust will be there, which is the most important thing in the world. without that trust is what brings jealusy, and paranoia among so many other horrible guy wrenching feelings. it all comes done to this qoute; would you rather hear a lie to make a smile, or the truth that will bring a tear?. i know what i would want and i am positive it is whatever other girl wants, so guys dont lie you have no reason to. so again it is easier to heal from the truth then it is to get over a lie no matter how big or small. 
also throughout all of this i have had it all wrong and who ever left that comment a couple entries ago was right. i am insecure, and untrusting right now and there is no way i can be with another guy until i start believing the things my friends tell me and until i become 100% comfortable and confident in my own skin. i know what i want but i have to seperate that from what i need. my time will come and because of that i know all of this will be worth it. i know it is going to be hard and i am still going to feel like shit every now and again but i cant hide out in my room anymore, that wont heal."

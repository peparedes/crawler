Lisa and I decided that we were going to have a movie day since I hadn't woken up until almost 1 today and we didn't really feel like doing a whole lot. Obviously, as you well know it was snowing today, so we did the whole cleaning her car off and shoveling it out enough so that we could go get food and a movie. <br /></font></span></div><div dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: #ffff00""><font face=""Tahoma"" size=""2""><br />When we first moved in, our land lord informed us that there was a flock of 88 ducks (there is a guy and his partner who live across the way, and every morning he goes out in his bathrobe to smoke. I guess he was bored one day and decided to count them). Now because they live here and pay rent, lol, ok, so they don't really pay rent but the land lord likes them. We are obviously supposed to be nice to them. Actually the kids in the complex and some of the little old ladies feed them bread. Thus in the middle of Jan. they are still hanging out here.<br /></font></span></div><div dir=""ltr""><span style=""color: #ffff00""><font face=""Tahoma"" size=""2""><br />So we are trying to get over to the store and the entire flock is just chillin' in the middle of the parking lot. Just where we would need to drive in order to get to the store. We drove up just shy of a couple figuring they would move, since that is what usually happens. You drive up close to them, they say, oh hey, car, we should move, they get up and move. Nope, not today. Today&nbsp;they got up, turned around, and sat back down. LOL, I almost died laughing. It was like they were saying, &quot;screw you, it's cold out, you shouldn't be leaving here anyway, and we are not moving. So just deal!&quot; Oh my god it was so funny. Although i'm not sure how funny you will find it... might have been a you gotta be there story. But I figured it was amusing enough to share.</font></span></div>"

She hands me this CD that she had made. 
Last week we had been riding back from clinical and a song came on by Jessica Simpson's latest boy-toy (I don't remember his name, but I know that Allie said she was married to him). The girls were all like, yeah this is a great song, blah, blah, blah. Talking about the dude when they found out that I didn't know who he was. It was a laugh b/c I never know who famous people are, but I didn't really think a whole lot of it. 
So today when she handed me the CD I laughed my butt of. It was so funny, and so incredibly sweet. The CD is entitled ""Jack & John: you should know us, we're famous!""

But which is better: to heal many and hurt a few or to never try and deny a possible gift or passion?
They say it is better to live and love then to never love at all, well is this like that?

A Simple Thank You ~


 
I thought THIS was worth passing along 
 
Last week, while traveling to Chicago on business, I noticed a Marine sergeant traveling with a folded flag, but did not put two and two together. After we'd boarded our flight, I turned to the sergeant, who'd been invited to sit in First Class (and was seated across from me), and inquired if he was heading home. 
""No,"" he responded. 
""Heading out?"" I asked. 
""No. I'm escorting a soldier home.""
""Going to pick him up?""
""No. He is with me right now. He was killed in Iraq. I'm taking him home to his family."" 
The realization of what he had been asked to do hit me like a punch to the gut. It was an honor for him. He told me that, although he didn't know the soldier, he had delivered the news of his passing to the soldier's family and felt as if he did know them after so many conversations in so fewdays. I turned back to him, extended my hand, and said, ""Thank you. Thank you for doing what you do so my family and I can do what we do.""
Upon landing in Chicago the pilot stopped short of the gate and made the following announcement over the intercom. 
""Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to note that we have had the honor of having Sergeant Steeley of the United States Marine Corps join us on this flight. He is escorting a fallen comrade back home to his family. I ask that you please remain in your seats when we open the forward door [so as to] allow Sergeant Steeley to deplane and receive his fellow soldier. We will then turn off the seat belt sign.""
Without a sound, all went as requested. I noticed the sergeant saluting the casket as it was brought off the plane, and his action made me realize that I am proud to be an American. So here's a public thank-you to our military for doing what you do so we can live the way we do.

Oye, people, please tell me when you are worried, TALK TO ME!
I don't know that stuff is bothering you if you don't tell me.
I may not be on campus as much, but if you see me talk to me. A lot of times I won't talk to people not because I don't like them, but because I hate gushy girls, and I am afraid I am turning into one. So for lack of things to talk about, I will just say hi and keep going. ASK me, TALK to me. I love talking to my friends. If you are my friend I would think that you know that. 
I'm sorry if I seem distant, I don't mean to come across that way at all. I don't mean to be pulling away, I am trying to balance everything. If I seem distant, TELL <i>ME</i>. Don't talk about me behind my back, PLEASE! Tell me to my face. I appreciate your worry if you are worried. Help me please, because this is a first. I am not trying to screw it up, a lot of you have a ton more experience, I appreciate input. I may not do everything you think I should and I may not like what it is that you have to say, but I still do listen and think about what you have to say. Truly I do. 
So please, tell me if something I am doing is bothering you, I can't fix it unless I know, and saying something to others does me absolutely no good because they can't tell me what you are feeling. I don't know who you are, but I really hope you read this so that you can tell me yourself what I am doing that is bothering you. Please, help me. I'm not perfect, but I sure can't become a better person unless I know what it is that I am doing wrong."

My grandmother decided that she wanted to have this huge reunion with her siblings, there were ten if I remember correctly, and their families. 
Picture 65 Irish-esque people all together outside. Yeah, it was fun. Some of the people were silly and camped out in the hotel instead of the Giffune Trailer/Tent park, but that is ok, we forgive them b/c they were from MD and hot places like that where they don't have maine weather. But it was really cool because there were people from Japan (Sara and Sam) and LA/San Francisco and wicked cool places like that.
Plus I got to see Paul, Alli, and Mike (aka Sid) again, which was fun. Oh, and Katie, Joe, Gracie, and Hannah, (Gracie came home with us, btw). 
So yeah it was wicked cool
Then on the way home, Dad and I had a good talk about my lack of... sig other. Yeah, very frusterating, but enlightening. hmmm. I think that is it. 
I feel very boring, but I am tired, and have a HA, lol from studying. So I am saying good bye for now.



**Only a few more weeks and schools starts again, am looking forward to it very much in someways, but at the same time.... yeah. Oye, I am a drama-girl."

hmmm, what else... Oh, last night we got home and decided to clean the pool, typical since we wanted to go... swimming... sorta. Anyway, so dad and mom needed help taking the cover off. So I go out to help them. la lalalala la. They needed someone in the pool so I take my pants off and jump in... HOLY CRAP it was <i>FREEZING</i>! I think I completely lost my breath upon entering the water. Oye, so I finish up and was going to take a shower so that I could unfreeze my body, and Sara called. It was so good to talk to her, even if I was a bit frozen. I miss her so much, actually I miss all my college people. ::sigh:: But it was a lot of fun, she ended up hanging up b/c she ran out of minutes on her card, but it was really great to talk to her. 

I think that is about it-ish. lol. hmm, so maybe not so much has happened, since I last wrote, but now you all know. sorta, lol. 

ttyl! :*"

Because of<br>your shy and timid nature you will not have so<br>many friends in your life. But then again,<br>large crowds aren't your thing anyway. You are<br>comfortable on your own and are reserved to<br>others who you don't know or know very little<br>of. You know everyone out there does not want<br>to be your friend, and knowing that is good.<br>However, people who don't know you that well<br>thinks that you are cold and distant since you<br>don't want  to talk to them. Although you mean<br>no harm, you can't always be perfectly<br>understood in the world. No one can. Life in<br>general are you quite serene with even if there<br>are some things you don't like. Your love-life<br>is not so full of boys/girls, but if you<br>flirted more with the ones you were interested<br>in I'm sure something would happen.

"event","I drew some of the coolest pics yesterday, i think I am getting better at shading, it was fun.
Yes I was supposed to be subbing, and technically I was.
I could answer all the kids questions about the movie, and caught a bunch of them napping.
So see, I was paying attention, I <i>can</i> multi task, I just can't type and talk...
meh, something I can work on. 

Another thing I need to work on is being able to draw people laying down and at angles
I'm not very good at that,
They always look weird...
ho hum, practice makes perfect right?
lol, at least in somethings
oye am I in a crazy mood
AGAIN! 
When well it stop


Oh, btw, my icon is missing one of the words, it is supposed to move and it blinks feel.
So it says ""I wanna feel you on me...""
not ""I wanna you on me...""
It isn't a gangsta icon, sheez. 
I wish it had pasted correctly.
Oh well. Maybe I'll chang it again.

g2g now, my lil munchkins will be to school soon. :D"

"event","So today I am a middle school science teacher. Thus far, it hasn't been too bad. I am sub-ing for a teacher whom I liked when I was here, although everyone who has seen me (obviously being a small town most of the the teachers know me) have made comments such as ""aren't you a bit young to be sub-ing?"" lol, wow, I never realized how young I look until I meet people who have known me for a while or kids that I am supposed to be teaching and are... well <i>a lot</i> taller then I am. Oye! lol. Oh well it should be interesting. 

One of the first kids to come in, comes up to shake my hand, and go me, I say, Oh hi, I'm Gina. lol, so much for being called Ms. G. Actually I prefere to be called Gina, Ms. G is my mom and grandmother. I just hope that the kids listen to me the same as Gina. ::crossing fingers::

So Friday I will be going for a drug test to make sure I don't do drugs. lol, it is for a CNA class I want to take, and then around 3ish I get to go to an interview for another job. I hope that I get it, or if I don't, they decide that I shouldn't take the CNA class too, then maybe I could work with Keith, that would be fun. Although I am not all that sure that it would be all that good for me or him. Although it would be a lot of fun. 

Hmm, what else is new in my life? Well, not a whole lot, Shannon called last night. She has been trying to get me to meet this guy her bf rooms with. I did meet him last Monday, he is even more quiet then I am, if that is possible. So she asked if I wanted to talk to him, I said no and she said, well here he is. Neither one of us knew what the heck to say! Oye I was ready to kill her! Although to his credit he did try. I was like, <i>I don't know what the heck to say to this guy! And he def doesn't know what to say to <b>me</b>!</i> Then he asked what I was doing this weekend, I was like, Oh, shit! But he didn't ask me to come over, so I didn't have to feel bad about telling him that I had no interest in him. Oye, why couldn't he be an asshole, then I wouldn't feel bad. But he really is nice, I just have no interest in him. Kinda like some of the other guys who have liked me. 

How exactly do I manage this? All the guys <i>I</i> like, have no interest in me, but the guys who like me... they are nice guys but I really am not in any way attracted to them! Why can't I fall for a guy who falls for me or visa versa?!

Ok, enough of a hissy fit. I really am happy, it is just that I wish life were... well fair. Oh well, g2g, my little munchkins will be arriving soon. :D Wish me luck!"

"event","So my dad is going to be ok, they removed the left lobe of his thyroid. 
when they did the biopsy they said it was non-cancerous and it was merely
a complex cyst. They forget that cysts do not typically grow that fast, but
Doctors do know best right? 

Anyway, so we were happy about that. I called Dorna to let her know, and got
Keith. I didn't really feel like talking b/c my mouth still hurt (yes I am a 
wimp, it still hurts... ::sigh::) Plus I didn't reconize his voice until after
I had already asked for Dorna. He apparently made faces at me while his mom
talked to me. lol, that makes me smile. Then she passed the phone back to him,
I can never tell if he likes talking to me or not, but I am guessing that in
his own way he does b/c he wouldn't hang out w/ me so much or talk to me if he
didn't, right? I hate not knowing...

Hmm, what else, I am no longer actually taking vicidin. It made me nauseaus <--
can't spell, so I stopped taking it. I am down to 800mg of Advil. Not much better
for my stomach, especially since I don't really feel like eating, but... yeah. 

Talked again until 1:30 this morning. That was fun, then I slept on the Futan b/c 
I was too lazy to go up to my room. Got up at 5:45 to make breakfast for my lil
sisters. Apparently we don't have chocolate chips so we are having purple muffins.
Actually they are blueberry but they look purple... Yeah, wonders never end, lol. 

May pester people at the places I have applied to again, just to make a nussence
(again, can't spell) of myself. Mom and Dad will be getting home around 11:30ish. 
lol, last night would have been a good night for visitors, but I wasn't feeling 
good and there is the lil one to be kept in mind. Oh well. lol. Yes I enjoyed college
mostly b/c I could have night-time visitors. Although that was just one aspect I 
liked about it. 

Hmm, I think that tis it and my muffins are done, so good-bye for now ;)"

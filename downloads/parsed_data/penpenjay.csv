"event","Tonight I bring you a delivery story...

(at the new apartment complex right near us)

After about two minutes of progressively louder knocking on the apartment door, I call the number they give us if we need to contact the customer. The guy stammers for a second, and explains he must not have heard the knocking because he had his door closed. [halfway beliveable] ... then another minute or so passes... I get a call back from him... 
Customer, ""Uh, dude, I'm not going to lie to you, ... i'm not at my house. I'm at winn-dixie, could you bring it there?""
At first this just strikes me as an unnessicarry lie, but then, I wonder how he could have possibly pulled it off even... 3rd floor apartment, no back door, I guess he could come running up the stairs, ""yeah dude, my room was uh... over there... with the groceries..."

"event","Browsing wikipedia is one of my favorite ways to dodge doing homework.
This morning I was reading about Chattanooga, TN., which was the
hometown of the author of memoirs of a geisha, I followed some links to
read about yakuza ... name origin was quite interesting ... or
hachi-kyu-san, as most of you seeing this will probably already know
about the card game, i'll skip it =P. somehow it segue'd into iron
chef, which had an anlerfish tmed show, which brings this to the
factoid that inspired this post... 

[anglerfish have a unique mating method. Without light, finding a mate is a problem, especially at a
time when both individuals are ready to spawn. When scientists first
started capturing ceratioid anglerfish, they noticed that all of the
specimens were females. These individuals were a few inches in size and
almost all of them had what appeared to be parasites attached to them.
It turned out that these ""parasites"" were the males. When a male
anglerfish is hatched, he has extremely well developed olfactory organs
that detect scents in the water. He has no digestive system. His goal
in life is to detect the pheromones that the female anglerfish release.
When he finds a female, he bites into her flank which releases an
enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body. The two then
fuse together, including blood vessels. The male degenerates into
nothing more than a pair of gonads that releases sperm when the female
releases hormones into the bloodstream that signals she is ready to
release her eggs.]

And know you know."

"event","This morning after work, there was this little orange kitten in the five-star parking lot. Apparantly its been hiding under one of the old broken down delivery trucks there for some time now, it was scrawny and skittish. You could tell it wanted affection by the way it watched people walk by... it would crawl out a little bit and flop down on its back or wag it's tail playfully. If called out to it would dart from car to car, edging closer as it circled about, untill it got within  arms reach, even if people wouldnt move, it would panic and run back to it's home under the old truck. It seemed to enjoy batting at gravel."

You like things edgy, subtle, and smart. I guess that means you're
probably an intellectual, but don't take that to mean you're
pretentious. You realize 'dumb' can be witty--after all isn't that the
Simpsons' philosophy?--but rudeness for its own sake, 'gross-out' humor
and most other things found in a fraternity leave you totally flat. <br><br>I
guess you just have a more cerebral approach than most. You have the
perfect mindset for a joke writer or staff writer. Your sense of humor
takes the most effort to appreciate, but it's also the best, in my
opinion.

"event","today I watched a movie called Cashern. movie made sense little. <spoiler alert> There was a mentally challanged superman who was also a ""zombie""? from the dawn of creation, who came to life when a robitic bolt of lightning struck a vat of stem cells in post-apocolyptic Eurasia. he was also covered in blue mud. He was buddies with another superhuman who dressed like ~shishomoru (sp?), and another who wore a flag. The good guy was a doctor who was exploded by a grenade baby, the magic stem cells forced his ghost back into his body durring his funeral. He was then given a suit of armor that made him look like sub-zero... he then proceeded to karate chop a robot in half. The movie was like watching episodes 25 & 26 of evangelion w/o having seen any of the rest of the series... except lasted 2.5 hours. The use of filters and lens flares CONSTANTLY also gets to your eyes and gives a wierd feeling of vertigo while watching the movie. the scary thing is... it wasn't all that bad.

also read Transmetropolitan http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmetropolitan 
I found it quite enjoyable, the feel of it reminded me heavily of ghost in the shell, but more dysfunctional and with more political intrigue."

Last night I went to the clock with sarah. Been wanting to go there for a while now. Then we watched the first 7 episodes of Firefly, it was very fun. =)
This weekend i watched mr.&mrs.smith, war of the worlds, and howl's moving castle. all of them were really good I thought.
Mr. & Mrs. Smith---A decent movie about assassins, but not quite as funny as either Gross Pointe Blank, or The Whole 9 Yards
War of the Worlds--- more of a Horror/Thriller than I was expecting. But the action and tension were both very... spielberg
Howl's Moving Castle---GREAT artwork, as is to be expected of ghibli, the voice acting was sadly dry, with the exception of billy crystal as the fire ""demon"" calcifer, the music was top-notch, the setting was kinda cool, but was less detailed than the worlds of mononoke, spirited away, laputa, nausicca... etc

on a separate note .... Raplh's Hamburgers is no more ... it has closed several times in the past, but the owner said he will not be reopening it this time."

"event","Well, just got home from work, that was a busy 4th of July, probly the busiest night ive worked all summer. (its now almost 5am). Tip average was low given the holiday, ~1.50 per and had a couple people trying to pull scams, and in Matt Funk's <<cool name>> infinite wisdom of bussiness operation sheduled 1 person to do all of the inside work (phones, tossing, ovens, etc... on top of managing) we drivers helped out what we could, but we were mostly out of the store. (actuially, he had scheduled 3, but moved 2 of them to the Citra store south of Hawthorne... they got 3 orders all night)

Really looking forward to Firefly bein aired on sci-fi, talked Sarah into watching it, gonna go over there. Yeah, I know ive seen the whole series (wgat was realesed of it anyway), but I think it'll be fun to see it on tv. i think it airs the 15th

"event","Tony Jaa dint punch anyone in the face, but he did knee a bunch of people in the ribs, and elbow smashed their heads. He also jumped though a spool of barbed wire, had a refrigerator thrown at him, and when his legs caught on fire, he kicked a dude in the face. 

The movie was about 100 minutes long, and about 80 of those minutes were action scenes. The actor started out as a stuntman, and does all of his own stunts now, without wires or CG.

Top scenes~ (spoilers?) 
1) Getting a 1-hit KO against the reigning champion in a Bangkok boxxing club.
2) A cripple with throat cancer shooting the action hero.
3) The hero's fat sidekick smacking said cripple with a heavy wooden beam repeatedly.
3.5) Said cripple being crushed by Buddha.
4) When he is fighting while on fire.
5) Tuk-tuk driving off of a bridge into an apartment building (explosion).
6) Uber bicep Howard Stern from brittan
7) Chinese dude with GIANT fro.
8) When he is fighting while on fire.

27) When he is fighting while on fire.

Seriously, if you thought anakin being on fire was great in Ep.3, you will love that scene. =)"

Just been stiing here, even with the fan on high and the ac blowing, it feels muggy and opressive in the room. How can it be that just trying to update a weblog could make me swaety and panicky. Being lonely is the worst when wanting to open up to people can cause so much completely unfounded fear."

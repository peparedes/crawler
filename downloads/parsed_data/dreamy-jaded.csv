"event","eheh, hows she going? i've been on my death bed for the last week almost, and because god hates me, i didnt die, but i had a virus and am now on pills. why, oh why did they not just leave me to drown in my snot??? i guess parents are supposed to care though, right? hmm. 
well, on wednesday i took the long haul from Sudbury (hell) to Toronto (a lesser hell) and i thought the bus driver wanted to kill me. he honestly took the longest possible way there is to go through toronto. we went to the Eatons mall, which sucks. no offense. and then we went to see The Lion King, which i was amazing!!!! i had a wiked seat too! i loved it, it was better then i thought it would be. overall the drive was worth it. and then me, ashley, kori, and kara caugh a clerk at a gas station reading gay porn, which i was amazing. i bought a skirt at the mall. strange? i agree, considering i dont wear skirts. but it was only 5$ and its brown cord with a poofy thingy, and its super cute. i just need to buy a nice pair of knee socks, cause im in a ""no shaving pact"" with kori (we want to see who lasts the longest, and i think it will be me because she has a bf, heehee). yea, so i cant not wear knee socks, because i think some people at school would be highly distressed over my rebelous behaviour. ne who. i havnt gone to school a single day this week, except for to get on the bus to go to toronto on wed. i went this morning, realized that there was no one there, went outside to meet sydney, then got a ride home with Vesna. so now i am here...again. this house is getting kinda depressing. 
my uncle bought a Corvet. its yellow. its also 2003. it cost him 80 grand. it cost him 80 grand that came out of my late aunts life insurence. good thing? bad thing? i dont know...all i know is that im inheriting that baby when he died (which is gotta be pretty soon considering he lives alone and is weighing in at about 350+...and adding on everyday)
today me and Jp exchanged christmas presents, and he bought me a really beautiful gold chain. im scared to break it. i think he doesnt like his chain i bought him. i put a ring on it, but i think he wont wear it, or he wont want to wear it. maybe i should steal it back while hes sleeping...then he wont have to. i'll be doing him a favor. who wants to help me rob my ex of the present i gave him this morning? hand up? anybody? all we really need is some black ski masks??!!! 
CHRISTMAS IS IN A WEEK!!!!!!!!!!!! ahhahaha. thats wonderful, except for the fact that i havnt done barely any shopping yet. well, cest la vie, thats not what the holiday is about, right? its about getting lots of presents. i think?
ne ways, i'm off.

p.s. hope all you suckahs had fun at school today! ahhahahahahaaahhhahaha!~"

"event","alright. this is ridiculous. honestly...this whole year has been utterly ridiculous and im so sick of it, because as much fun as it is to be ridiculous i need some sanity every once in a while. my mental stability is getting a little rough around the edges. it seems as if everyone has power over me except me. i can name at least 7 people who, with only a few words, could completly break me down...until there was nothing left and i had to run away to another country to escape from it all. everyone is getting to me and getting in my head...im talking everyone. friends, family, people i dont even like or talk to often. i slowly falling apart and everytime that a bit of me starts to disinigrate, its like a dominos effect. cablamo. not only am i bringing myself down, but i keep bringing other people down with me. i feel like im exposing myself way too much to too many people for benefit. im returning to my stupid vicious circle. 

I need change like I need air. 

if only i could depend on some one...because right now, i have no one that i can 100% depend on. theres always a catch. either their using me, or they want a piece, or they live 10974350978 miles away, and theres nothing i can do about it. too bad i wasnt more religious...then at least i would have a god. but even Jesus cant help me anymore."

you know what? im super sick of people. pretty much all people. all i ever do anymore is analyze peoples problems , and its getting annoying, but i cant help it. every one is fucked and theres nothing anyone can do about it. and liers! whats with lying. everyone does it. and its a pain in my arse. lord love us all. 
i am so excited for christmas. i havnt had a good christmas in ages! after my aunt died they have all been weird. so now i am ready to rock and roll. this is going to be a wiked holiday! well....i hope it is. i hate it when people say ""x-mas"" is so stupid. it takes all the special meaning out of the holiday! but i do it too, so meh. 
ne who. does ne one who reads this play the guitar? because if u do, then u kick ass my dears. if ne one has ne wiked tabs, please dont hesitate to send them on over, svp. im tryin to learn Stay Together For the Kids...but its not working out the greatest.
i got the new blink cd and its pretty good. well, i didnt buy it or nething, my friend burnt it for me, lol, cuz im a cheap kid. its more serious then their other albums, but its cool. when they recorded, they rented this huge mansion on the ocean near San Diago where they all live and they had all the recording stuff in this huge house, and they pretty much lived their and had all their friends over. at one point there was apparently like 40 different snares and like 100 different guitars and stuff. i think that would be so amazing to live in a place like that. and i bet it was really inspiering. all my friends have bands and its kinda cool. but mostly they all are just a bunch of ppl hanging out and jamming. i always wanted to start up a  band, like a all girl band. that would be cool. but then we would end up like The Donnas, and their retarded (no offense to ne fans out there) lol. kk, well i guess i should sign off, cuz now im babbaling.

last night i flipped out soooooooooooooo bad, and i had no one to talk to, so it was even worse. ok, so there marc. marc is nice, marc is cute, marc asked me out a while ago and i said i wasnt up to ""dating"", marc means alot to me. he is a ""dear friend"" and i dont want to mess that up. lately i have been really liking him and thinking i would ask him if he still wanted to go out. i've been lonely, and he makes me smile, so why not, right? well we were talking last night and i thought he knew i smoked, but it turns out that he didnt, and he asked me if i did. and i lied and said no. and i felt like shit. im so scared that hes going to find out and loose all trust for me, because my word means nothing to so many people these days, i dont want to add him to the list. but i feel like shit, and i think i really like him. :S
i was at alyssas today with Kylie, which was cool. me and Kylie were going for a walk and it started hailing, so we ran to alyssas place and i stayed for about 15 minutes. there both pretty nice people. im soooooooo cold, damn wind! 
ok, well thats all for now. im not feeling so great, so i might go and get some sleep before CSI starts.

"event","hello. 
ok, here we go. i hate doing this whole ""catching up"" thing, but i'll do it any ways. not this weekend, but the weekend before, i went to a ""party"" on friday. as in a bunch of underage kids with no where to go went to a park and got wasted. there were about twenty of us and we got sooooooo wasted, its sick. we were jumping off the slides and i remember and and lyndsi went to go take a pee behind a building and she fell over and has huge cuts up her ass! lol. after about 4 coolers, a 40 to myself, 2 beers, another cooler and some scotch, i puked allllllllll over my self. it was discusting, but i had alot of fun. then me and sydney walked home. [that is a very breif over view of that period of time]. next day we went to the lot and slept there with syds dad then we went to skead to have dinner at her grandparents. i felt kinda weird tho, i was tho only none family member there. its all good i suppose. then on monday i went to a really great show. it was soooooo fun, and i got a wiked Alexisonfire shirt! which rocked! 
this weekend i went to sydneys grandparents for the whole weekend and we just hung out. last night i got all of 2 hours of sleep. i couldnt sleep and sydney and i were do our darndest to piss each other off. then when i fell asleep around 4. she woke me up at 5:30 to go have a cig. arg!
 every once in a while i get a weird vibe between her brother and i. but then i snap out of it and remember that its little annoying mattew fuller. its probably just because im so lonely, lol. sad, i kno. 
i am so effen sick and tierd of happy couples. people whos biggest problem in life is whether their bf looked at another girl or not. i am super lonely these days, and im yearning to be in a fight with a guy im ""seeing"". this isnt usually what im like. but i guess im feeling pretty abandoned by some people these days and i have very few people i can go to. i have sydney...but she has the world, so its not a very co=dependant relationship. both of my parents have told me in the last week that i am the only person they can talk to and that they need me because i am the only sane person they know. i hate my sister. i feel very alone. so, i am not to upset with myself for wanting a boyfriend. 
any ways. sydney and sarah-lynn cut my hair last weekend when i was super tanked. it doesnt look all that bad either. lol, surprisingly. (i dont know how to spell) 
ok, so all my old friends are friggen stoners and im sick of it. its retarded! uhg. well, im depressed and tierd, so im going to go and try and be productive. 
maybe.

p.s. i read Catcher in the Rye and i actually liked it. i love that time period and ara and all. good reads!
p.p.s. alexandra fulks. i have not abandoned you. i tried calling you the other day. i was all ready and roaring, and some one was on the phone, then i fell asleep. im never home. i never anywhere special, just not home. i was gone alll weekend. i actually got all your messages this time. i just need to be in a certain mood, because i dont feel comfortable sharing all my retarded shit and i am usually pretty depressed, so im usually not in the mood. so usually, i should go hang myself in a closet (not seriously...lol) so i will do my very best. e-mail, and i will e-mail you back. i kno my word means nothing, so maybe i should work on that...."

back to Don i suppose. well, he went to St.Charles and has been playing at bars in his bands since he was about 16. so i was pretty impressed with him. then he tuned my guitar and we started. he pretty much started with notes and stuff, like which string was which note. i kinda knew this stuff already, but it was good to have my memory refreshed. turns out i kinda suck tho. i dont move my fingers very fast and also they are very short, so i have a hard time reaching all the strings. i guess im not totally inclined to play the guitar, so it will be a wonderful challenge! he asked me what songs i want to learn and i thought of Andrew W.K - She is Beautiful. i cant really think of any other songs off the top of my head, so if any one has any ideas for wiked songs i should try and learn, just comment on this post.
tomorrow is my dads pay day, so i think im going to go shopping. hopefully.

[in random order]
you know when your alone, and your borderline depressed and you have nothing to do so you sleep or do nothing and then your mood just gets worse and worse? well try some of these.
1. eat something yummy [ you can do that when your not alone as well]
2. Rock Out! [ok, so your with your friends listening to a song and your all nodding along, but inside you just wanna go crazy like your maushing or something. when you are alone, feel free to go crazy and even to break things along the way. 
3. watch a goooooood movie [everyone has those movies they love but dont want other people to know they do, e.g.The Little Mermaid, The Sound of Music, etc. these movies are the ones that your friends refuse to watch with you. watch them at this low time in your life{no offsense to people who really like these movies}]

 -well, i've been super stressed lately. i dont really have any extremly good reasons, but i will inform all of you any ways. I feel very alone right now, im not sure why. i feel as though i dont have very many friends and am not the person i want to be. my school work is lacking and im sure im going to fail math. but there is nothing i can do about it. i mean, my teacher doesnt collect any work, she doesnt help anyone, she doesnt even check homework. so im just going to fail all my tests and be done with it. 
mike and i arent talking. im not terribly upset about that, except that when i am lonely and bored i usually call him. so now im lonely and bored much more often. 
last night i came home and slept from 3:30 - 6:30. then i talked to Jp on the phone for about 75 minutes, watched CSI and went to bed. its weird talking to Jp on the phone. we always have good conversations, but then when i see him in person...its usually not so good. he either ignores me or has very little to say. im sorta worried about him. no one likes him, he has no one to look out for him and also hes very into doing what the crowd is doing. like he hangs out with all these grade 12s who make fun of him and shit and he does what they do and thinks hes too cool for the world. but really hes making a fool of himself. i dont know, i just get the feeling life is going to screw him. but doesnt life screw everyone?
ok, i've been fighting with my family 24/7. like you wouldn't believe. i dont even talk to my dad anymore, and all my mom ever does is bitch at me about smoking and about fighting with my sister. blah. maybe i should just move out and get it over with. i think if i did that though, i would end up not coming to school and like dropping out or something dumb. which isnt worth it. 
omg, i have such a huge headache! ahhhhh. bummer to the max! i have a feeling im boring you. 
today at lunch jp bought me and sydney pizza, which was lovely. it was picture day today!!!!!
dreaded picture day. always a bad day. thats my excuse for why today sucked! it was picture day! thats why! like duhhhh! lol. 
i was sitting in front of the camara and darren had just got his picture taken when all of a sudden i hear ""RACHEL! YOUR BUTT IS STICKING OUT!""
and of course i start laughing hystarically, at which point the photographer chooses to take the picture. Darren, you ass! too bad your such a cool kid, otherwise i would reck you! lmao. should be an amusing picture! 
dont you find photographers always suck. like they are always mean or just plain bad at what they do. i should try and change that. be a school photographer and be wiked at it. lol. 
well, im going to end this post before it gets waaaayyyyyyyyyyy too long, maybe i will just start another one in a second. lol

i smoke. its a true fact. i dont like it. i try not to, but i do. i have had a very hard last year and instead of trying to kill myself, like other people i know did *cough**cough*, i picked up a bad habit. i do not force it apon others, i do not ask others to come out with me for a smoke. i do not deny i am addicted. and i consider it a disgusting habit. but i do not understand why my ""friend"" thinks that if he stops talking to me, and always bugs me about it, then i will quit. micheal has told all my friends to stop doing things for me, any favors, anything, like passing me something in class or w/e, and to just tell me that i should quit. i think this is ridiculous. if people are going to do this, then they are not my real friends. i havnt changed one bit. i am still myself. i am still a depressed piece of shit and i think they should all be able to see this. i think it is a very low form of judgement. but w.e, i smoke, so i suck.

yesterday was alright. school is getting better. i've had two spares in my computer class so far, which is wiked! sydney slept over last night and we just hung out with Billy, Jay, Nate, and Wes for a while. she took 6 gravol, so she was super tierd. we slept from like 12 - 8, then we slept on and off till about 11. 
MOMMIES MAKING ME CHOCOLATE MILKSHAKES! yummy! what a treat to wake up to! Yesterday was fun. i got to put a Hello Kitty band-aid on Sydneys butt crack! it was amazing! lmao. 
i think im going to try and get a job. soon. like Biancos Movies Super Center or something equally cool! i have my first guitar class on tuesday! i am super effen excited! yeayea! 
i dont know if anyone watched CSI on thursday, but it was a really good one, and i have one of the cases stuck in my head. i keep thinking about it. it was the one where the girl and boy killed each other and the girls mom helped them do it. they had a kid and everything. it was totally weird, but it was good. it was kinda romantic and a deep way. it was weird because when they first showed the girl who died/commited suicide, i thought to myself, wow, shes really pretty and looks like a wiked person. i wish i was more like her. then it turns out she has a kid and all this shit. it was weird. cause as they were going threw the show i felt like they were talking about me. lol. well, im going to go and eat a super de duper yummy milk shake.

"event","hi everyone
today was much better then yesterday. still a tid bit boring, but i can deal with that. I am now sharing a locker with Sydney, but im still keeping mine, so i have like, storage space or something, which is cool. we had a test in math today and i finished close to first, but i dont think i knew what i was doing. so if any one would like to place a bet on whether or not i failed or passed, that would truly amuse me. im thinking im going to go with PASS! but thats just because I am in a very upbeat mood and think it would do me best to keep posative thoughts in mind. 
i have to dance soon. i can feel it in my bones! i put on a new pair of Dickies today and i couldnt fit my belt in it, so i pushed it threw and then i couldnt get it off to go to the bathroom, so i had to wait till i got home to go PEEEE!!!!!! not smart rachel!   
last night i didnt get home till about nine from sydneys. i went on her bus after school then we went to the mall and junk. i took the bus home, but i got on the wrong bus, so i had to walk for about 20 minutes in the rain to get home! shittah! well thats it for now. im super hungery and stuff, so i'll be back later perhaps...

"event","hi. i had a pretty good last few days. i went to my friend kyles camp and went crazy. it was cool, but three days living in the bush was a bit much for me. then i got back and called up SYDNEY. at which point we immediately started hacking darts and drinking vodka. the night involved yelling at 9 year old ""sk8er boiz"" we didnt know, smashing giant light bulbs, swimming in our underwear in front of many on lookers and then going crazy on a trampoline. and this was only between 7 and 12. so you can guess how much we get around [not in the bad way]. so now sydney left after our last nights hurah [""celebrating"" the end of summer and her birthday]and i feel as if our friendship is coming to an end. it pretty much started at the beginning of summer and we spent almost every day together. now that the end of summer has come i feel as if everything we had is now ended. im soooooooooooo dramatic sometimes. whatever. im depressed and tired and sick to my stomach of myself. i spent the day in my friends pool with sydney and then we just did nothing. but it was a good nothing. ever get that, where your doing nothing, but your happy. very rare feeling. im not all upset about going back to school like most people. i just dont care. i need a change, and fast. so hopefully this will give me the sparkly new feeling im looking for. we can only pray for lost souls such as myself. im sore as fuck from tubing at kyles camp and i can barely move. cest la vie. Van Halen rocks my world [most of the time]. what to do with my self, what to do? ne answers? that would be a miricle. i just wanna jump out of my skin and take some one elses. sounds sick, but i suppose im a pretty sick person. have fun and eat something yummy...

Jp (my ex) bought me a few Kinson pins. lol, so thats cool. then i got a ride home with some guy i dont know, Chris something, and Jp walked me to my house from where we got dropped off. omg there was a massive thunder storm last night and i almost died! it was so loud and so close to us! it was amazing. i wish i had a camara then! yea, so im going to go and think lots about all the great music i heard. then im going to go over to Jp's house and take his Static Lulaby cd. :D!

"event","I have to be the most retarded 15 year old girl on the planet. honestly. i am super depressed, i have a headache, my stomach hurts, i havnt eaten all day and i only had 4 or 5 hours of sleep last night. I decide to pick this point in time to try and get back in shape. lmao! i did a 10-15 minute jog, then i did 3 push ups and 7 sit ups! yea for me!!! whootwhoot! surprisingly enough i am in a much better mood now and have averted plan A) - hang my self in my closet. so i think things are looking slightly up for me. My friends left today around 4. its weird, because when i spend time with Sydney, its not just like an afternoon or a sleepover, it always ends up being like, 3 or 4 nights and days straight. So then after she leaves its sorta...i dunno, like relaxing. she is such a high energy person, sometimes i have a hard time keeping up with her. so im just trying to relax and re-coop i guess. i have some shopping to do tomorrow. daddys pay day! yea! lol. today has been a slow day. one of those days where you do alot of thinking about stuff, then you look back on the day and do some more thinking about the same stuff. oui, non? i know, i dont always make sense. i do my best. tomorrow is thursday. also tomorrow is the strung out concert. i happen to be very excited for this concert as it consists of quite a few amazing bands, such as Far From Heroes, A Static Lullaby, and of course, Strung Out. I guess i'll have to snag a few bones while im shopping cause other wise, im listening to the show from the parking lot (i always seem to end up doing that any ways??!!). bummer for me. i really like watching local groups, even if their not all the greatest, because i usually know the people in the band, and i get to hear the stories behind the songs. its fun. for example (for anyone in sudbury) Last Chance is a pretty wiked band, and im hanging out with them all the time. its so much fun to just hang out and watch them develop songs. same as FFH. well, i guess im done for now. Im not sure what im up to tonight yet. maybe going to chill out in my hood on Madison! (yoyo dawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwg!)so have fun tonight everyone and eat something yummy!

"event","im so sick of this damn house. i dont have the energy to be anger though. my sister has been rude and cruel to me all week, and im sick of it. her friend came over today and i had a bunch of friends over (Sydney, Matt [her brother], Billy) and i was wearing her friends arm bands, i told her i would give them back in a second and she punch/slapped me in the face. so i flipped. shes so lucky i didnt punch her back. so instead i just told her off and would give her her shit back. seems childish, but its better then me punching her out. aferwards i got in trouble with my mom and everyone for being so mean. i dont understand it. not at all. i dont care or understand any more though. i just decided that i will put as much space between my sister and i as i possibly can. i just dont want to be around her anymmore, so it doesnt matter. 
i am really tierd. me and sydney were out all night. we walked everywhere, and anywhere, for hours. it was amazing. then we thought there was a bush party by my house, so we were walking threw the bush in the pitch black and fell over and stuff about a hundred times. we kept walking till we found where we were going. turns out it was a late night baseball game at the local college, which is a pretty hefty walk from my place. so then we indulged in more walking. i guess its good for me, since im so out of shape these days. summer always does that to me. :(, lol. all the Joe Louise are worth it though. 
on a serious note. today is the one year anniversary of my aunts death. i loved her so much and miss her with all my heart. this has been the hardest year of my life without her around. i miss her and love her and am still convinced it wasnt her time to go...
yea, well today i went to my school with my sister and syds brother to go to the orientation. it was boring and stupiud and i dont want to go back. you cant make me!!!!!!!!!!
well i guess as soon as my friends leave im just going to get some sleep. i sure as hell need it. like a mad man."

"event","Dear Rachel Andrea Nairn,
this is a much needed wake up call from your better half. I am writing to you, my more dominent lesser side.  Do you think your cool? yes you do...but you are wrong. do you for any reason think that people know who you are or like you for who you are? you are wrong, again. You tend to try to hard and act as if people actually give a damn about you. as usual you are incorrect. Here is my advise. try wearing clothes that are made for the female sex, baggy pants and t-shirts are for girls who actually have style and can pull it off, you can not. Dont worry, your black hair is washing out and your pathetic blonde/brown roots will soon be grown out. If I were you (which I am) I would bleech my hair to attempt to blend in with everyone more. Try to get some pants that fit you, although i understand your delema in the fact that finding jeans that cover your wide rear is difficult. good luck with attempting to become something other then a piece of shit. although you discust me with your bad habits and lack of humor, I still have some hope for you. hurry up and snap out of it before I give up on you completly.
yours truly,
Rachel Andrea Nairn (the good side)"

"event","Hey everyone. I ended up going to my friend Mikes camp (blah) and it was pretty boring. The drugs were plentiful and the entertainment was lacking. So, i just ended up sitting on my own and doing the whole, PeacfullyEnjoyingTheNorthenSceneryAndBeingThankfulForEverythingIHave, deal. not so bad. once it got late and everyone was in the sauna doing, youknowwhat again *rolls eyes*, i just sat at the lake and the northern lights were crazy. it was like 1 in the morning and the stars were soooooo bright. i found myself trying to find constellations, and it turns out i only know about two. the big dipper and the little dipper...and the north star, lol. does anyone know lots of costellations? it was something that i wished i had read up on while i was out there. i was thinking, if the northern star is always north, then eventually, if you follow it far enough to the north, you will have to turn around to see it. know what i mean? like all of a sudden it will be behind you. i think that is so cool, and i decided that one day, im going to follow the north star (no, not on foot, lol) until it is behind me! ne wayz. i couldnt wait to get home and relax. turns out sydney didnt sleep at my house, but she stayed there for quiet a while and left me a really nice note. she wasnt mad, so i calmed down alot and called her. im spending the night tenting on the lake at ""the lot"" again. we had a blast last time we tented. we were up till about 4, then the construction crew woke us up at like 9. grrrrrr! guess what! i dont know if you've ever heard about that thing where you can breath under water if you put your head in a bucket? well when i heard that i thought it wasnt true, but i tried it and it was wiked! i was under for like 3 min! fun stuff! ok, well im off for now! i'll leave another journal tomorrow hopefully.

"event","ok, heres the story. my friend sydney and i are super close, shes pretty much my best friend, and shes the one who has ""the lot"", ne ways...i made plans like ages ago to go to my friend Mikes camp for his b-day, but lately hes been an asshole and i really didnt want to go. so i had been talking about it with Syd and we decided i wouldnt go because all he does is drugs n shit any ways. so why would i go right? but then my friend caitlin, who im real close with, said that her mom wouldnt let her go unless i went, and i felt really bad! so now what am i supposed to do...ok, so i go now, right? i mean, i had these plans before and w.e, so what am i gonna do!? but now sydney is really upset and shes staying at my house with my family even though im not here, which is cool ....its just that i feel Soooooooooooooooooooooooo bad that i left her like this. i mean, we kinda made plans over all this, and now caitlin is dragging me into this. so i just needed to vent all this, and let everyone know(even tho the only ppl who really read this stuff of mine is chanelle, and sometimes other ppl i dont know [still cool, im not dissing lj or nething]) i wont be around for a day or so. i just hope that syd is not as mad when i get back. she keeps saying stuff like, i wont be able to see her till school starts now because shes going to be busy and involved with other stuff, but then she says shes not mad or nething, so i dont know what to think. plus, i really dont want to go to camp with Mike and ppl. w.e, i'll get over this eventually. hopefully syd does too..."

"event","Its early morning (sorta) and i just woke up and my friends mom came and got her. last night was...very....interesting? i think thats the word i want to use. it started out with my mother buying my friend and I (we are underage) coolers?! strange, well thats just the beginning. We ended up playing with a car seat we found and leaving it in the middle of the road, then we hid behind a truck to watch and see if someone hit it! to my extreame dissapointment, no one did. then some stupid 4 by 4 decided to stop and try and be the hero by moving it out of the road.although they did leave the arm of the chair (which Sydney and i casually ripped of while dragging it around the street)so we can only hope some one hit that. cest la vie! today i am spurging. i am doing lots of shopping and i am extreamly excited. the mall tends to depress me after long periods of time, but i will get over it. especially if i have a new wordrobe! Caitlin and i will end up having a blast no matter what though, because we have my rents debet card! lol! well i should be off to go shower. im dead tierd since i went to sleep around 4 and woke up around 9:30. so have a good lunch everyone (or breakfast if your so inclined)

"event","Hello, this is me, Rachel again. I just spent this lovely hot Sudbury summer afternoon traped in a hell-like mall scenario. not cool my dears! and i didnt even buy anything, which is tres shitty! lol. anyways. i was thinking last night, and i was trying to figure out, why is it that cold drink get hot and hot drinks get cold. i mean i know they all talk about this whole room temp stuff, but really, they never go to that nutral tempurature, they always end up opposite of what you wanted. i think im going to ask my science teacher about that when school starts. I have been really stressed out lately. my friend, (i dont want to use names)pressured me to hook up with this guy and so finally we ended up doing stuff together, then he ended up being an asshole. it was too late for me tho, cause then i liked him more then ever. after a while i realized that the guy liked my friend and thats why he ignored me and was being such an ass. so last night they were talking on the net and both admitted they liked each other (did i mention that my friend has a bf and hes the guys best friend?) i bet that story was hard to follow without names, but its stupid for me to be telling this story anyways. i guess i just need to vent. w/e, i'll get over it. i just feel like i didnt need this shit right now, but hey, when does any one need shit ever? well im out for now.

Pain and pleasure, like light and darkness, succeed each other.

It's odd that you can get so anesthetized by your own pain or your own problem that you don't quite fully share the hell of someone close to you. 

Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;...

It is easier to find men who will volunteer to die, than to find those who are willing to endure pain with patience. 

Pain is life--the sharper, the more evidence of life. 

""So I'm here 'til I die?"" 
""Til they kill ya.""
""Then why bother curing me?""
""The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.""
""So it's to be torture?""
*nods head*
""I can cope with torture.""
*shakes head*
""You don't believe me?""
""Well, you survived the Fire Swamp, so you must be very brave. But nobody withstands... the Machine.""

""I suppose you've discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain.  At the moment, I'm writing a definitive work on the subject.  So I want you to be totally honest on how the machine makes you feel. ...  Now remember, this is for posterity, so be honest.  How do you feel?"" 

*just cries*

All evils are equal when they are extreme.

So great was the extremity of his pain and anguish, that he did not only sigh but roar. 

When there is pain, there are no words. All pain is the same. 

There is no real evil in life, except great pain; all the rest is imaginary, and depends on the light in which we view things. 

We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret or disappointment. 

Guilt is perhaps the most painful companion of death. 

You purchase pain with all that joy can give, And die of nothing but a rage to live.

Nothing begins, and nothing ends, That is not paid with moan; For we are born in others pain And perish in our own. 

Pain is no longer pain when it is past.

Sweet is true love that is given in vain, and sweet is death that takes away pain. 

""Good night, Wesley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning.""

Plan for this world as if you expect to live forever; but plan for the hereafter as if you expect to die tomorrow.

What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal. 

For what is it to die, But to stand in the sun and melt into the wind?

There's a thing that keeps surprising you about stormy old friends after they die; their silence. 
</lj-cut>

""Good night, Keahi. Good work. Sleep well. I shall surely kill you in the morning.""

I'm not afraid of death; but dying scares the hell out of me."

"event","A few of the gifts that have been given me as I prepare to leave:
<lj-cut>
Lily - 
a compass mounted on a piece of wood that has a brass plate reading: San Francisco and gives the latitude and longitude for it.  That way I can find my way home.

Sophie - 
 Left for you is a thin but long box, perfect for holding knives. It's not wrapped, but the box itself is a creation. Made of a heavy, dense wood stained a dark red, the top of the box is engraved with a small orchid. The inside of the box is lined with black velvet, the perfect back drop to the knife within. 
        Definitely aged and well used, the hilt is wrapped with a strip of black leather but is otherwise plain. The matching sheath is only accented by bits of metal at the throat and tip. The blade is steel and about ten inches from tip to tip, and the only adornment is a small orchid etched onto the blade right below the guard. 
        With it, of course, is a note:
        Keahi,
        You asked for a blade and this is one of my favorites. One of a set of four, five counting the sword, and ordered from Spain so many years ago. All but two daggers were lost, with the sword just recently mended and returned. I give this to you as a gift and token, that it may protect you while I am not near. That it may show what I feel for you will not fade and wilt, but like the flower drawn, will last. 
        This particular knive has served me well in wars and skirmishes for a hundred and fifty years. It has seen revolutions and skirmishes, and covered the decks with the blood of enemies. I hope she fits your hand as well as mine. She should serve you well, or at least remind you that you always hold a piece of me close at hand. 
        Love,
        Sophie.
http://home.comcast.net/~cerys-nigel/forsophie.html

Gabriel - 
A locket with his silloquette on it and a braided lock of his hair inside it.

Hariel and Faith - 
They give him a small box, inside which is an oval object. The oval is about the size of the palm of a hand, and is inlaid with turquoise and a bear claw, and trimmed with beads. The style is Lakhota, the beads are Cuban, and the metalwork and manufacture method is Euro-descended American. The oval is fitted at the back with different fittings, and can be worn as a belt buckle, brooch or pendant - or fitted to any of a range of places.
Faith explains to Keahi that the mix of sources will help remind him who gave it to him - and ""So long as it's on you, you'll heal even faster than you normally would. Mama Bear helped me make that. It's not a strong effect, but it might make a critical difference."" 

Alain - 
Pictures of him and Gabriel and Keahi.

Most everyone... just pictures to put in an album, so Keahi will always have them near.

"event","What's new?  Just as life was settling down and looking good for a time... just when I was halfway through taking Oakland for myself... just when everything was finally happy; except for one issue of a certain vampire who chooses not to oath me...

everything crashes.
<lj-cut>
I should have known better than to relax and expect life not to be filled with angst ridden change and drama.  Did The Dragon read my mind in that I was ready to exile Lee if she did not oath to me?  ready to order her killed; if she did not leave the city with her Servant?  I do not know.  She placed me here, and then remains around making me look weak. She really is the only thing that was holding me back here. My power base, realm of influence, and circle of firends was growing at a rather steady pace. In fact... it was bigger than I thought.

Gabriel ->  Alain (assassin, who is taking care of Ray), Violet, Karma (another assassin), Mark (the Rat King and his people), Evie. 
Lily -> Antonin and the pard.
Sophie -> Nigel (a witch), Charles (a newly turned), Kale (another necromancer)
Azura -> (and her two rats
Aidan -> his numerous pommes, but especially.. Constantine (the journalist), Bade (Sobki of the Bask), Delynae (one of his friends)
Giles (an antique dealer) -> he took another rat for a pomme
Hariel (an his animals) -> Faith (a shaman and little sister)
Jeani, Zadkiel, Kelsey (my family)
Jessa, Shimoshin (two more warriors)
Marcus -> Izanmi (both computer geniuses)
and the rest of the vampires....

I was on decent terms with Orco (the Head of the Church).
Extrememly goods terms with Hannibal (the Bear) and Corbin (the Lion King).
Was working on terms with Adair (Pard leader).
Steady, but tense terms with Mark (Rat King) and Zane (Ulfric)... those two depended on the day whether things were good.
Things were great with Erec (the Fox leader), and I will give him ownership and all rights to his land.
I was ready to renew things with Bade (leader of the Bask), which would have been very excellent terms as I know now.
The I have a few witches that I seemed to work with...

Yes, things were shaping up.  I had just taken Catherine as my pomme de sang last New Moon; though I've had an arrangement with her for a time.  She belonged to me in exchange for protection over her people.  Through this deal, I had control of the crime rings in the city of San Francisco; and access to illegal imports and exports.  What a better deal could I have gotten?? And this was something Lee never had!  I tell you.. made it easy to run the city for sure.  These crime rings kept stupid random acts of crime down, and lowered my crime rates on paper.  Though I have no hand in the Independants, that was all good. 

I hope the next Master of the City realizes that to hold a city it takes more than being the most powerful.  In fact, we learned this lesson from Solange.  Sure, she was more powerful than I or Lee, but she pick a war with the wolves, which pissed off the rats, which led to her demise.  Where as, I might not have been the most powerful vampire, but I had allies among most (if not all) therians in the city and worked hard on keeping those allies close at hand.  Had a more powrful vampire tried to take my city... while it may have made me look weak according to vampire standards; I would have had many therian groups aiding me to take that other down.  And in the end??  What matters more?? Living or maintaining a strong appearances according to some ancient vampire's standards?  The warrior in me replies: living.  For if they die, then where's the threat?

So... just as all this was beginning to settle?  The Dragon has called me to her.  It sucks.  I'm taking Zadkiel with me, but having to leave behind my lovers:  Alain, Gabriel, Catherine, Sophie, Alara, Aidan.  And my family: Jenai and Kelsey. 

(OOC note: The following is Keahi's thoughts on the matter of a very vague letter.  Not all this is IC fact or figures. In fact, this is a journal; therefore, everything is tainted by the way Keahi views things. This journal will also one character's story and not the story of the mush.)

Well, things change, I suppose.  Of course, the future is uncertain, but I have heard rumors that I will be given a new city.  One that I will need to build from the ground up. I will be given help in this new city as well.  Some workings between the Queen of Nightmares and my Soudre de Sang.  If these rumors are true, then perhaps my lovers and those vampires who were close to me will follow me.  Then again, Gabriel things maybe I'm being called away to guard the stirring Mother.  
</lj-cut>
Who knows... in time we shall see.  I leave on the New Moon."

"event","Father Crow got Bear's help to reach me through Faith.

Faith sent me into the journey to meet Crow and here is what was told to me. I'm still trying to understand the meanings.

Keahi mentions before turning back to the speech of Crow. ""Um.. I think literal. He summoned Faith ta get me ta listen and told her.."" He closes his eyes to concentrate and get the words right. ""That he needed her ta be my light. I think that meant, needed her to guide me ta Crow. Show me the truth with all the voices in my head. It's been awhile. Then the rest was: Let him know I am here. The path of division will lead to destruction. A great storm is coming that will rain down fire that even Dragon is worried. All will fall if they are not united as one."" He pauses there. ""So, Faith showed, up and then I talked ta Father Crow myself.""

The Master looks to Lily and just nods his head to her questions. His too. ""And he told me that I walk a dark path that has not taken his love."" Keahi voice shifts as he goes into repeating the Crow's words exactly. ""Darkness is coming, a darkness which will cover you, those around you, innocents and criminals alike. A great flame will wash the lands clean, destroying all in its path. A flame that will grow small, but spread, until it has grown too great to be extinguished. And when it has burnt out, there will be darkness, nothingness, a void in the land and its people."" there is a pause before he continues, ""If you do not act, then there will be an end to all that has come before.There are many in darkness, many I do not know. I cannot reach to them, but I can see you are one point of light in a field of darkness. I see each light extinguishing one at a time. The stars of this land can become a constellation with strength or they can remain individual. Each individual will burn brightly and disappear. With no strength of bond, they will all die out. If you do not join these stars, there will be nothing left."" Yes, the conversation was informative, but felt shorter than the information that was passed. He looks between both masters. ""Nothing is unstoppable, he says. Tells me to Reach ou to the land around me. Find the different points of light, bind them to me. I am the strength and the heart. I must bring them all into one form."" He stops there and looks to his hands. ""That's all. I need help figuring out what it means, and what I am to do. I have my own ideas, but now is the time for me ta listen ta my advisors. I don't want ta put ideas in ya head. I want what ya think."""

"event","Vidette wrote me and asked to meet with me.  She's the human servant to Zedekiah the Master in Oakland.  She's a dead woman in a few months, but even so... her heart was in the right place. SHe was trying to look after Oakland and look after her master. I could not fault her that.  Even so, I could not offer her what she wanted.  I want Oakland. 

She did share with me that Zedekiah is a greedy bastard who is so self absorbed that he is not looking to his people.  They are raping and beating up the rodere who guard his sanctuary. Ahh.. the irony that.  He calls the rodere. Perhaps I could send Gabriel in... Ahh, now that is a thought. Have Gabriel slowly call the rats out of Oakland. Then again, that's a bit too noticeable. Back to Zedekiah, Vidette is trying to right the mistreatment, but the rats are getting impatient. I sent their Rat king my contact information.

In the end, I agreed to give Vidette time and protection for those rodere wishing to seek it. They come here, and I will give them rest from their troubles.  Likely send them to Mark. He's a good King and will take care of them.  Then I'll have allies within the Rodere. Not a bad thought. 

Catherine showed up last night to my 'meet you alone' meeting. I swear.. that cheetah! I know she was only trying to protect me, which is sweet of her. I corrected her today about it all. Then she gave me a present. One that.. I'm still speechless about. The first was a handmade leather leash.  The second was a cheetah pelt. -Her- pelt. She had Alain take it from her and freed that she'd get in trouble over it. For this.. I forgave her, because the gift was more than she could possibly understand. I love furs. Even more, she has claimed me as her master, and placed her life in my hands. I have told her that I forgive her this once, but not to do it again without my permission."

"event","Well, the last one was my gifts.  Now then, alot has happened.
 <lj-cut>
I have a new pomme de sang.  I have been looking to take her as a pomme for about a month, but Alain warned me that she was not stable enough a month ago.  However, now she is more in control of herself, and she is.. lovely.  I have a feeling that she will be training me verses me training her.  In fact, she's been trained since she was 15 for this by her brother, and later Adrian helped her adjust that training to being the pomme of a vampire.  

She's been good to me.  She straightened up my room the first time she came over and laid with me while I woke.  She purrs. When I ask her about how she wants fed, it doesn't seem to matter to her as long as I'm pleased.  When I tease her, she purrs. I smile and she purrs. The woman is like a huge purr box, and it's addicting trying to get a purr out of her. There is also something else besides her purring that attracts me.  She knows who she is. She lays there telling me stories and things about herself. She loves to tease me back as well.  

I had a rough morning once this weekend and she came over after I called her. Laying there with me, we talked over things before she said something that had me laughing. Oh right.. ""Kitties are superior to canines."" Sounded like her grand-pere!!  I swear, what is it about these D'Evereaux's that I find myself surrounded by them?? Arrogance to a fault!  Of course, I don't have much room to talk, but they think they are superior to everything!  I bet secretly that Alain thinks he's superior to Gabriel.  OF course, he'd never admit it our right.  But is not Alain Gabriel's masterpiece?  Is Gabriel Her masterpiece or just an aritst she had trained...  hrm.. food for thought there. 

Catherine was also with me more this weekend as I went to con Zedekiah out of Oakland.  It was going so well!  Samantha has real talent.  Only that pesky Human Servant of his got in the way.  If she'd just stayed out of it, they both could be in Germany, on a new plane, living a life of free from the hassles of the city.  But no.... he saw my con and called me on it.  He was insulted, the poor thing.  Then he made his first mistake. He threatened me and my people, thus challenged me.  I seized the moment and declared terms of challenge between us.  Technically, he had that right, but I when the opportunity presents itself, you take it.  I declared a physical showdown one on one between us.  We took things outside.  Alright, it stinks to fight a Rotter like that. You get goop and rot all over your hands, and it's gross. The contest of wills was playing between us. He grabbed my shirt, I took ahold of his wrist and ""Flamed on."" Burnt his arm fairly badly.  The bit my hand sending corruption through me. Thank the Great Spirit that Lily was there!!  I lost this battle fairly embarssing, but I will win the war that has begun.  Time to go make plan B.

Catherine fed me and called her beau, Corbin, to come out.  Corbin, the Rex of the Alfalfa Umpogo Pride (I think that's it's name), offered me of his life fountain as well.  OI.. two alpha kitties?  Can we say power high and I felt drunker than a skunk!  Even so, it was nice to be surrounded by friends.  Azura came in, and Ryan... Catherine stroked my hair for a bit as we all laughed. I have some damage control to do with my people and let them know I am still strong and they are safe.  It'll all work out though. 

Ryan is staying in the Sanctuary because the pack pressure is too much.  Seems Grace has lost her marbles; maybe I should send her some.  Then again, that's horribly mean of me.  Maybe they will be kind and put her down. Let her go join the munin with her former pack and with what's his name that she loves... Lewis. I really don't envy Jolene or any them for what they deal with.

Finally, my gentle Temoin has returned to me.  I laugh though. He questioned whether I desired him.  Silly man should know that answer. But ahh... I took him to my bed. The first to be there beyond Grace. It felt good to have him there. Right. I am Master and not the one sneaking around. Technically, all the vampires belong to me (yes, save for those I have given to others), but they should be welcomed at my side if they are loyal.  I do need to get with Gabriel and Alain sometime soon. I have something for them both. 

One more finally,  I have the ultimate best Mama in the world.  I went by to see her after all was said and done. Just to check in really.  Show off a little at my new found freedom and rebirth.  She has wisdom and insight beyond her years.  She pulled me into a hug and let me hide there in her power for a time.  She worked on papers while I rested on her couch.  i think she also needed me there, though she won't admit it.  Needed time to relearn the feel of my power and know me again in that way a Maker can know her made.  I didn't mind. She's been supportive of me as of late.  It is her right to know me like that.  More over, if I keep her close, then I see the truth of her actions and not fabricate some lie about what she's doing.  Because I see what she is doing.

 <lj-cut>
I have discovered there are more friends of mine than I thought before.  I don't celebrate Christmas, but the following people have given me gifts: 

Eden, a werewolf pup:  The four books from Dragonlance Chronicles:  Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Dragon of Winter Night, Dragons of Spring Dawning, Dragons of Summer Flame.  SHe and I talked about books once.

Brigid, a werewolf pup:  She made me a t-shirt with the front done in those little sparkly stones with ""Keahi Air"" written across the front.  It's to remind us of the time I took her flying.

Lily:  A golden pocket watch of an antique quality with fine etching upon the face.  there's an inscription inside too:  ""The measure of a leader is as the measure of a mighty river. Strong, sure, flexible, yet slowly wearing away all resistance over time. You are that river. - Love, Lily"" 

Alain: A sleeping stuffed dragon in the colours of flickering flames. This looks like it was custom-made. It has black spines down its back and broad wings that can be folded in. The secret is a tiny music box triggered when a certain spot is pressed. The voice that comes, Keahi would recognize anywhere. Alain's, singing, a folk song about dragons and battle. Singing the Dragon to sleep like he has before.

"event","I do not hold her anger against her.  She has a right to it. 

<lj-cut>
I awoke to a message for me to call Grace, so I did.

It appears that when the Fae took the marks upon me from Alex, that they took the ones on Grace as well. 
It was not my plans; but when dealing with the Fae, there are risks.

Truth.  I gave her no choice in the matter of the Fae deal.
Truth.  I gave her no choice in the matter of me seeking to take Oakland.
Truth.  She was never my equal, but my animal servant. 
Truth.  I gave her my name, but i had no intentions of marrying her after she left the first time.
Truth.  I did not promise her that I would keep myself only unto her after she left the first time.
Truth.  We have different lifestyles that were not compatible any longer. 

So is it that I was ""tricked"" and the bonds taken a bad thing?  Could this be a blessing in disguise?  Now, she can have a relationship with an equal.  She can marry him, grow old with him, and have a house with him. She can wear a wedding dress like her mother wants, and be in a monogamous relationship where he adores her above all others. This gives her her dreams back.  

It also keeps us from having to be a thorn in the other's side. I've released her as my pomme de sang. She can feed any vampire that wishes to feed from her.  She can be Zane's punching bag when he needs it and have her blood spilled all over the floor.  Her blood is her own to give to her pack in healing without concern that I will get upset. She no longer has to worry about what her 'master' thinks and can live her life as a pure wolf under the direction of the Ulfric. 

Really, is this such a bad thing?

Her words do cause me to pause and wonder... 
Would she have denied my chance to be cleaned of chance I had to be washed of my shame from the marks Alex had upon me?  Did she even realize how much that was tearing me apart and hurting me? How much strife is caused between Mama and I?  How if this did not work, I was planning to leave the city and wander in the shadows to escape the feeling of being dirt in the eyes of my people?

Next thought are her last words echoing in my head...
""Dreams of a mortal. You've condemned me to death, with no hope of us ever reconciling."" Another pause. ""You've gotten what you wanted all along then, Keahi. Goodbye and have a good eternal life.""

Condemned to death?  Is it not that mortals die?  We all must die at some point; even vampires.  Vampires die in the turning. We have true death that is always a fear.  Death happens and is part of life. 

Did she simply seduce me last year to achieve a means to skirt death?  Was all that I was good for was a means to obtain immortality?  Is the only reason she wanted marked was to avoid death?  If so, that.. no, I will not mark her again. I cannot. There is more to this side of life than immortality.  If all you want to do is escape death, then you will not be happy as a vampire.  If it's only to live out the fairy tale of true love, then you will not be happy as a vampire. Vampires are ambitious and we live in a society that is ruled by a monarchy.  The word of the Master of the City is law for that land. It is a huge game of politics, posturing, and aristocracy. Friendships are made and broken.  Trust is never given.  Someone is always your dominant and master.  Someone is always under you. And almost all of us are subject to the dawn.
</lj-cut>

Welcome to the grave. Welcome to hell. Flames and firey brimstone are a welcome sight compared to this place.  Yet, it is my home. It is the place I have chosen to live, and I do not regret my choices. If you want to dance with the immortal, then you must embrace a world where you are giving up freedom and equality.  You must understand that the mortal dance we walk is an illusion. 

I'm not sure she could understand all this.  Or perhaps, she understood it all too well..."

"event","More birthday gifts?

From Sophie: http://www.gastropods.com/Shell_Images/A-Con/Charonia_tritonis.jpg 
Inside the box is a large shell, just shy of twenty inches long. A Triton's Trumpet, the legend is when played by the god of the same name it would calm or rise up the seas. It has been modified to be an actual trumpet with the spire turned into a mouth piece. Around it is a long shoulder strap, the brown leather decorated with a pattern of flames and wolves.

I also have a new pomme de sang.  I've been considering her for a pomme now for about a month.  She's finally settled enough on her own and after a long talk, we have entered into the relationship of master and pomme de sang. Her name is Catherine Halliwell, Alain's grand daughter."

"event","New alliance made:

Between Vampires and Independent Shifters: Indies are given neutrality amongst inter-group relations within San Francisco. Expected actions from both factions are: Help will be given if possible against outside influences, beyond the Indies keeping eyes and ears open as best they can from the position of their lands to the east of Oakland near that of the Pride's. Help and Sanctuary to individual members will be given, if at all possible, when no one else is around to do so. Respect restrictions of non-adult Indy members when considering relationships, and if a Pomme is to be taken, knowledge given to the Indies of that fact. 

Because of the nature of the Independent Shifter, a list of known Indies is given, to be updated as changes come about: Catherine, Rhianne, River, Roger, Ronald, Sergio, Simon, and Tom. 

Yep, the world keeps turning.  I'm glad the independant therians have managed to join together. That was rather smart from a tactical standpoint."

"event","Hrm... tonight. I learned something new.

How to change dead lights for new ones that twinkle. I shall kill someone like that one day, I think. Don't know how to make it a war defense or offense, but give me time. I just know Alain's tree was pretty with all the lights. 

PS. He has a grand daughter?!?!?!?! I can't believe he threatened me. ""Better treat my grand daughter well or else..."" Silly vampire. I love him.

Other than that, not too much else that's new. I got two more presents that were cool. 

Catherine: http://www.scrimshander.com/Dragon.html   Within the box would be an ivory bone handled switchblade knife with a very delicate scrimshaw carving of a dragon upon the hilt.

Alara:  Carved from a single block of wood, this sculpture depicts a dragon and a serpent locked in mortal combat. The dragon has been carved to appear straining upward while the serpent is coiled about the winged creature's body. The dragon's wings arch over the sculpture, talons at the tips rigid with effort. Although claw marks can be found on the serpent's body and the dragon's flesh is torn, neither seems to have acquired a clear advantage. Their heads face each other, mouths open in a perpetual and mutual howl of antagonistic rage.
The dragon's scales are almost diamond shaped, overlaping in places and lying smoothly side by side in others. The dragon's lips are pulled back in a snarl and his teeth seem sharp where they encase his tongue. His eyes focus malevalontly on the serpent's and the intent to do damage upon his foe is clear.
The serpent's scales are rounded where they can be seen, his long body one sinuous, rippling muscle beneath the skin. His head is a rounded wedge, lifted from the dragon's belly to hiss defiance and strength upward into the dragon's challenge. Looping about the dragon's body, the giant snake's coils have begun to contract, holding the deadly claws at bay.
All in all, the sculpture stands at just under two and a half feet tall with a spread of slightly over one and a half feet. 

Time for bed with Maka, Tate, and Flame.

Oh.. I found the flower gorwn by a blind woman. Kendra gave me a violet. All is set for the Full Moon."

<lj-cut>
Hearts of fire
Streets of stone
Modern warriors
Saddle iron horses of chrome

Taste the wild
Lick the wind
Like something they never saw before
Their jaws dropping to the floor
Steel made of soul and sin

Rebels born without a care
And the day he listens
Only to fly where eagles dare
And the night she whispers

Chorus:
Ride the wind
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun
Ride the wind
Never coming back again
Ride the wind
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun

Painted flesh
Loyalty
Humble pride
Just as far as the eye can see

Stories told
Two old friends
Of battle scars and lonely bars
And nights the rain wouldn't end

Here's to withered eyes wearing gypsy smiles
And the day he listens
Here's to lovely ladies and a million miles
And the night she whispers

Chorus

Ride the wind
I'm still the bravest soul in sin,
Burning till the night is done.

Solo

Of all the truths and lies
And stories of riders in the sky
They say only the bravest try
Where eagles and angels dare to fly

Ride the wind
Never coming back again
Ride the wind

"event","There are a few special people in my life who have gotten me presents.  I record them here:

<lj-cut>

From Faith: Your christmas present (but I don't celebrate that) is a very beautiful sculpture of a dragon, done in shaped driftwood. It has a scratch mark on the wing and a scent of blood about it. A note is attached ""I wasn't going to give this to you because it got damaged, but then I thought about it. This sculpture has been through earthquake and has been baptised in blood. It truly does belong with you, tankaku. I bought it in Vancouver, because I thought you'd like it. My earthquake adventure and spirit quest happened in the elevator while I was carrying this, and everything else I'd bought broke beyond recovery. This survived, but was underneath me and got somewhat blood-soaked and damaged. But, like you, it is a survivor. So it's yours.

From Grace: A shadowbox of sorts. Enclosed in glass, framed, is a collection of museum quality items from Ohlone civilization even before Keahi was born. Feathers, arrows, a bow, medicine wheel, etc. It is an original piece of art work from a famous Ohlone artisan. A card along with the package says ""Happy Birthday Keahi, with all my love forever, Grace."" 
And with all that love that walked out the door....

From Mama: http://www.titaniumrings.com/blackgold/liungA.html  This ring, and a second one with a Phoenix.  The Pheonix and the dragon fit.  As Mama put it:  She is the Phoenix risen from the ashes, I am the fire thta burns as a constant.  I am the dragon who fiercely protects, she is from a long heritage of dragons.  It just makes sense.  Then, this morning as I was looking the rings over again, I found this: they're engraved on the inside. The Phoenix ring has 'Mama, I'm Coming Home' on it, and the Dragon has 'Ride the Wind' etched in. 

</lj-cut>

Mama, I'm coming home... by Ozzy. 
Ride the Wind... by Poison."

The signed agreement.

Keahi Windriver agrees that Faith Winslow, Servant to Keahi's vampire David 'Hariel' Martinez, shall provide magical services comprising one instance of calling her Totem, 'Mama Bear', for Hannibal. Ms Winslow shall also translate for 'Mama Bear', should such translation be required. She shall provide the lands and the sweat lodge for this instance of calling 'Mama Bear', and shall provide gifts for 'Mama Bear'.
In return for this service, Hannibal shall confirm his alliance with Keahi Windriver, such alliance being:
* That Hannibal shall assist Keahi Windriver to defend Mr Windriver's City, should Mr Windriver's City come under attack; provided that Mr Windriver's City is within one hundred miles of San Francisco, and that the acknowledged Master of San Francisco is not the one attacking Mr Windriver's City.
* That the Den will stand neutral if Mr Windriver's City is not San Francisco; and the acknowledged Master of San Francisco attacks Mr Windriver's City, or Mr Windriver attacks San Francisco.
* That Hannibal's medical facilities shall be available to Mr Windriver's people, on the proviso that the injured or their representatives contact Hannibal and permit Hannibal to arrange discreet and prompt transportation to the facilities.
* That Hannibal or his aide regularly check Mr Windriver's Sanctuary, and advise Mr Windriver or his nominated representative on improvements that can be made to the security of the Sanctuary.
* That the alliance is binding until either Mr Windriver or Hannibal shall die."

"event","Last night I found my tear!!!

I put Grace to bed after Court. Wow.. I love my people, but I swear I want to kill them sometimes. Sophie brought Bubble Wrap and popped it ALL the way through Court!! She's so lucky compared to the others. 

Note to self: Charles cannot sing and is not permitted to sing -ever- again.
Second note to self:  Forbid Alain to wear such distracting clothes to Court. I just wanted to touch him the whole entire time!  Of course, he had his necromancer there. That man likes playing with fire. 
Third note to self:  Remind Aidan that I love him. Though the boy deesrved me questioning him in front of everyone after what he's pulled recently.
Fourth note to self:  Remember that sending Marcus to Gabriel to be punished is an extremely useful tool. That boy looked sheet white when Gabriel stood up. I love my Temoin!  However, Marcus has a number of troubles coming his way:  -Alain- (tha man would scare me, if he didn't love me so much), Lily and Azura (teamed up? I am such a happy man to have them both), Giles... (hmm.. I need to check him out), and Sophie (heaven love her, she's a sweetheart).
Fifth note to self:  Buy Lucas something really nice.  He's the sweetest wolf -ever-. He actually wanted to feel my power and that was awesome. Not only that, he believes in fairies and has never seen them!  Yep, he deserves the boon I offered him. Thank you, Lucky."

"event","Met Iope again.  Silly sprite thought I slept in a coffin and was trying ot wake a dragon.  Must move the Goblet again so she can't find and steal it. 

She asked to see it and asked me to bless it.  I engulfed the vase in flames. As my hands touch the vase, the silver chalice became encased in blue flames. The fire that surrounded the chalice grew to a bonfire size almost instantly, the color of the flames changing from blue to orange to green to an almost fuschia-like red. All the while, the fire was completely heatless. There was a roar, like a lion, an elephant and a squeaky metal hinge all at the same time, the sound grew almost deafening.
Just as suddenly as it started, it was gone. The fire, the roar. Gone. Just the chalice remained, sitting there still on the top of the coffin, seeming to glow from within as if it were some magical light source. The glow was subtle, warm and inviting.

And thus, I shocked the little sprite. I am truly a dragon. She didn't believe me, but won't argue with the Chalice.

I have the lock of hair, and here is the other ingredients and recipe.

Find the Chalice of Peace and Harmony.  
Bless it with the firey breath of a dragon.  
Fill it with water from a pure, clear spring that has never been tampered by the hands of man.
Put in the following inredients: 
First, a lock of hair from a virgin who has lived as many cycles of the sun as two of Pythagreus' sacred numbers multiplied together.
Second, a tear from a true believer, one that has no reason to believe but does anyway.
Finally, let the vase bask in the love of the two cooks who are of two minds with but a single thought, to hearts that beat as one, two lives that share a single soul and love from sun to sun.

So.. difficult task. I know my cooks, but I will have to do some politicking to have them there on the night of the Full Moon. :/  The true believer is now my hardest task. cannot be a child for they still see fairies. Hrmm..."

I need to go meet with Iope again.
I need to spend some time with Grace.
I need to start planning my take over of Oakland as their structures and rules are becoming more and more unstable. 

I need to decide what to do with the Sanctuary when I take over Oakland. Perhaps I can move the Sanctuary to Treasure Island?  Or find a place in Oakland and give San Francisco back to Mama. She'll have to recruit her own vampires as I will take a main core with me.  I will take all that will come with me. Or, I could leave San Francisco to Gabriel... I think I'll talk with Mama about it first. I still desire to stay connected to her. It's not that I must have her around, because I know that I will kill her if she rises against me. It's just... after one hundred years of loving her, it's hard to stop. It's hard to stop caring for the one that saw me through the horrors of teenage years and brought me back to life from the shallows of the grave.

And even though the moment passed me by
I still can't turn away
'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Got tossed along the way
And letters that you never meant to send
Get lost or thrown away

And now we're grown up orphans
That never knew their names
We don't belong to no one
That's a shame
But if you could hide beside me
Maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell em your name

Scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there
Did you get to be a star
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are

You grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
And reruns all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell em your name

I think about you all the time
But I don't need the same
It's lonely where you are come back down
And I won't tell em your name

</lj-cut>

Azura sang me this song.  Seems fairly fitting.  I grew up way too fast and now there's nothing to believe. Where are the dreams that I used to have and the vision?  My new dreams and hopes just seem like they won't work.  I have to accept that a relationship I once loved is gone.  Is this the way it is for those of the legend?  Great love, and then nothing?  Zadkiel, my son, come find me. I must take time for you before you're gone too.  

Azura let me cry for a bit.  Find a place to hide.  As I talked and shared, I mentioned turning Aidan over my knee at Court. Then Azura begged me to do to, so I obliged.  She threatened to rot on me and I told her I'd make her wash my laundry.  My laundry must be scary, because she stopped.  Fear my power over the vampires!

Yet.. Azura said something to me that I won't forget. She'd followed me into the sun to save me. This is MY city.  These aren't Mama's vampires, they are mine. If I go somewhere else, they will follow. 

""I've waited for a Master like you for a hundred years, Keahi. (The others) never wanted to know me. She didn't want me to be a person. Only another mask like she is. And it's her way, but her ways aren't the ways anymore. I would have died for (the others), only because I was oathed. I would die for you, because I love you. I would walk into the sun to save you. Because you're right, you did give me space to grow. You and my ratties lifted me out of my maze. You didn't beat me down when I was lost, when I was helpless. You didn't reinforce in me that I was weak. If you go to Oakland, I'll follow. I'd follow you in the sun. No matter what (the others) thinks, no matter what she does. You're my Master, like she never could have been."" - Azura

yes, my rule will work in this old and ancient world.  Strong hand of discipline mixed with loving care. I just have to make sure my vampires are able to handle the ruthless world beyond my City.  That will be my next task. After the Sprite... and after Oakland."

October, Thank you! I found a 21 year old virgin with flame red hair. SHe gave me a lock of it for an ingredient. Now to find Iope again. 

Met with Lee again tonight. I don't think she'll stir up trouble or threaten me, but... I don't get her. She's pulling away from me, and I don't know why. I am not really sure she's ever really loved me. Not sure what it means to be her son anymore. I have her name, but... I just don't know. I'm left confused and frustrated. Why can't she just submit or even just be my mom?

Yet, in the middle of this pain and revelry, I ran into Aidan.  I love that boy as much as I want to strangle him. He's shamed me and my law. Yet.. after we talked he left with these words: 

""I want no other Master than you Keahi. None. I do love you for what you do, Keahi."" - Aidan

Makes me feel good to know I did something right tonight. Next time he pulls this crap, I'm taking it out of his hide.... at New Moon Court. I'll bend him over my knee like a child and embarass him in front of everyone. it would serve him right.

Off to read now... then find Grace to curl up."

"event","I have the Chalice of Peace and Harmony for Iope. It's awesome. Well, and it's on loan from the British collector.  In fact, that arrangement was beautiful.  Giles offered him immortality, so the MotC there has a new vampire.  In exchange, he will loan me the chalize for about 2 weeks every time I write him for it.  Therefore, it stays in his collection.  This is a good thing.

I'm still looking for that virgin.

Does anyone know how to ward a room from the Fae?  I swear, intimate time is not the place for such laughter by a little sprite showing up!

However, she does make me laugh, so I can't get all mad at her. It feels good to laugh when she's around. It just feels good to laugh period.


Grace and I are good. She's a beautiful woman. HOwever, she doesn't follow orders very well. OR rather, doesn't take the hint to GO get out of the room for half an hour.


Finally,  the apartments. Zane's been afraid I'd turn the pack into lap dogs.  Geesh.. what a nutter!  The only reason I would do that is for the good of both vampire and pack.  For example, if Zane goes blooming mad and there is no strong leader for them... I'll take them until they can stand on their own again.  After all, having them strong and flourishing is better protection for watching my back. Why keep them docile and unable to protect me?

I found out that Zane finds me to be an arrogant, self-centered, bastard.  Well, most the pack too. It pissed me off something fierce. Then Grace pushed and pushed. I lether into my thoughts, and she shifted and howled and attacked like she'd attack me. That brought the brigade to the roof and before it was all over, Zane revoked my invitation there.  Sure, he came to apologize later, but he's still not welcomed me back. Well.. not personally anyway.

Instead, Jared holds my invite and is not revoking it. He's a good man.  In fact, Merideth likes me. That is the oddest thing, but she's not calling me a corpse anymore.  And I miss it. Well, I don't miss her hate, but I miss her calling me names. I'll have to let her know I don't mind it."

News of Iope...

Giles and Marcus found the Chalice of Peace and Harmony.  I should have that in my hands soon.  I will need to bless the Chalice with fire from a Dragon.  Iope was blabbering about me being a little vampire.  I showed her my true form and scared her.  That was funny... in a weird way.  Also sad that she's so skittish of me. Maybe it'll earn me some respect knowing that I could eat her?  

The second item is this:  A hair from a virgin that has to have lived as many cycles of the sun as two of Pythagreus' sacred numbers multiplied together.  That's 3 times 7 is 21 years old. Surely this can't be too hard to find. 

It's strange... the times I'm the most happiest and most alive right now are when I'm around her. She's so full of life!  She's claimed me as a pet, and I've claimed her as my sprite. Sorta.. I won't beckon to her every summons, but.. maybe she and I will ally one day. that could be interesting, and maybe profitable.

It appears that I will need to makes this Moonlight Dew once every 100 years, but so far, it isn't that bad.

Other news???

"event","Gracie loved the gifts I gave her, which I expected. She asked me to join her for the Full Moon, but I refused. I just don't see the beauty in planning when to have sex and then stealing away like naughty teenagers to the middle of the woods. Now, stealing away is rather romantic, but plan to steal away??  Nah.. it should really be an expression of love and not something coreographed. 

I talked with Mama. Perhaps things will get better. She's sending Samantha to the Sanctuary to show her support of me and keep an eye on me. That figures. it's not really a bad thing though. Just a mother curious about how her boy is doing. Now to make sure Samantha doesn't go telling bad things. Then again.. I'm hardly at the Sanctuary much. She just doesn't get the way I lead. She doesn't understand.  Then again, she's not around to understand. A firm hand to hold them in gentleness. i must be turning our world upside down on her.

Then went to see Aidan. The boy is greedy!! he's naming 3 pomme de sangs this New Moon.  One of which is a journalist. This will be mighty useful to me. It's a good thing Aidan sees his use as well.

Then it was to Gabriel's house. Gabriel, you are a lovely man! I am still feeling a little shunned for being pushed from his bed because he can't take the heat of my existance. But at least I understand better now. He does love me. very much so, and is a faithful Temoin. I sat in his lap again. Does he realize what comfort just his touch brings?  Being shunned from his bed was not really the issue. It was the thought that he'd never allow me to touch him. That he wouldn't want to touch me.  He kissed me. The love is present and that is what matters. I asked him to pray for me. I hope in a months that things will be different. That I will be cured of this affliction and can soar through our ranks. 

Finally, I checked in on Alain. He is still lovely without all the hair. I wish he could see that. Damn is Maker for schooling him otherwise! He was curled up with a necromancer. It was.. frightening. That boy could mark him in his sleep and he'd end up in the boat that I am. Perhaps I should nudge Alain to take the boy as his Human Servant, and then there won't be that issue.  I'll jsut have to see how things work out. The touch of power by that man made me squirm inside. I really don't want to feel the touch of another necromancer. I'm not sure I want to feel Alex's power again. To admit my weakness from this bond. 

One month... I must complete this task and obligation."

"event","After the earthquake and nearing losing Alain to fire... I headed out tonight in search of solice.  It's Grace's birthday, and I swear I'll kidnap her away soon enough.  Tomorrow is the full moon though. Maybe after that. Thursday or Friday?
<lj-cut>
But tonight was heading out to Alcatraz. Playing the dumb, the brave, and the stupid. I traded a trinket and $100 bucks for a boat ride there. It was fairly rough waves, but I didn't care. The driver disappeared halfway there and then the boat crashed. 

Upon the island, I saw the fairy pixie.. no, sprite. Certainly sprite. She is NOT a pixie! I think she's a she. I don't know. She's old, but looks no more over 10. I want her for a little sister. 

She bounced from rock to rock, did handstands, and just was this cute bundle that made me laugh. It felt -good- to laugh. 

There's something special at the Solstice.  She's giving her Queen this gift and asked if I'd help her. I asked her what it was, but she wouldn't tell me. Okay, not until after she stomped her foot and made cute faces. And demanded I make a deal with her. 

Well, I was curious so I asked what kind of deal.  She asked what I would want in order to help her make Moonlight Dew.  Whatever that stuff is. Seems that she can't make it herself to give to her queen and needs my help.  In exchange?? 

She offered to take away my bond with Alex. Like snapping her fingers and making it float away in my sleep like it was never ever there. 

I.. agreed, we shook hnds on it so the magick will work. ""I'll take the bonds you share with Alex, the self-proclaimed Peacemaker, if you help me make the Moonlight Dew."" says the sprite. Iope is her name.
</lj-cut>
Moonlight Dew. How the heck do I make the stuff?? ""You need faith, love, peace and harmony, purity and a whole bunch of other things to make this wine. And at least a month. You need to make it by the light of the full moon, you see.""  Sounds simple, huh?

Step 1: The first thing you will need is the Chalice of Peace and Harmony. The last anyone knows of it's location is that it was stolen by the Nazis in World War II. Find that and bring it back to her.  Try looking for the lost antiquities that belonged to Hitler. He had many books and works of art. Rumor is he had the real Mona Lisa for a while. Kept it in his bathroom.

Strange things you learn.... where to find this  chalice??  So confusing."

Life is.. well, death is what it is: death.

<lj-cut>
The only one who had never betrayed me has just left me.  He walks in knoiwng that the news he bears would not be to my liking and had not htedecency to pay me respects as Master of this City.  Whether or not I am covered in an aura of filthy, disgusting trash matters not; I hold this city.  I deserve his respect; especially after i have been his lover, given him Alain, agreed to so many things in which to spoil him with my love.  

And his words? The were vague at first and so much so that I could not understand what he was telling me.  He says he's not betraying me, but presenting those very words means betrayal.  no, he has not betrayed me as my temoin.  He is still around for me to seek out when I need claimed that it was he who courted me and sought me out.  That I was beatiful and attractive to him.... he lied. i was nothing more than some challenge to prove to himself that he was a Belle Morte and could have any boy that he wanted.  He used me.

I am nothing more to him than an object. A thing that can hurt him. Hurt him how? Through a power to power struggle or kicking his ass?  Sure, I could do that. but why?  First no recognition that I am his Master, and secondly, I am a thing to him. Finally, to top it all off! As I was making known to him that I held this city and that he served -me-, he called me a filthy dog.  Well, I called him a boy to enhance his understanding that I was boss of the vampires. He told me not to call him such a filthy name to be used for a mangy dog.  or something like that.. how many times when it was just he and i, did he call me a boy to help me submit to his powr and give into the comfort of his love?? So was I no better than a dog to him.. ever?

Beyond that, I disgust him.  i disgust myself.  I was born into my mastery with the mark from a Human Servant; my mother's human servant. I am a slave of a slave and nt worhty to hold this City.  No wonder Lee will not submit to my leadership.  I am the slave of her human. If she were to submit, it would throw the balance of things off. 

I dishonored her as well.  i asked if she and gabriel had been plotting against me.  I live in a state of being paranoid.  Why is this throne so precious?  it's because it is the last thing I have unto myself, and the only thing I have.  i have been trained for a century to be Lee's boy, her submisive companion.  She betrayed me as a Master the day she marked Alex. no, it was the day she allowed Alex to tell her that I can no longer belong fully to her.  And now? She expects to play my master again. It won't happen. She's made it clear to me that the Master of the city can have no master.  I have already cut those bonds between us that I clinged so dear to.  Even now, if I were to give the city back to her, I would have to leave it. I would have to go somewhere far off. Perhaps I could go to Yaminah. perhaps.. I will just take Grace and travel the world.  I know this land calls to my soul... it might drive me mad to the point that I will have to be put down.  i suppose that is alright, I will not see the stars fall anyway.

Alain, my brother, i love you.  Though I will miss your bed, I know that you do not hold against me the horrors of this accidental birthmark.  This mark that was put upon me asa sacrifice for Silver's life.  perhaps, we could be together again. Perhaps not.  I am simply happy that you will still play the role of my priest when I need to seek absolution.  Perhaps I should come soon and try to have you scourge my back to the point that this dirt will come off me.  Rub me raw with sandpaper until I am clean again.  Can I ever be clean again? Even my own mother is embarrassed to be around me.

Lily and Azura... my faithful rotters, my good and trustworthy servants!  though I am shamed, perhaps you are the only ones who will truly understand my shame.  For it has been the two of you that I have been rude to.  I have denied you things because of your bloodline.  You did not choose to be a rotter anymore than I chose to be the servant of Alex.  And I have turned away disgusted.  Yet, in my hour of pain, it is the two of you who cling to me and give me such honor!  It is you both you claim I am a good leader and beg me to continue on despite this horror that I am.  Yes, I will not forget either of you.  you are certainly cherished in my Court above all others now.

And Grace... my sweet love.  You are becoming ever more a beautiful woman. You have been supportive of me throughout this week, and for that, I thank you.

"event","OOC entry::

Okay.. I've heard that there are a few vampires out there that are concerned after reading Keahi's last entry in the journal.  I will remind folks that this is a paper journal IC and unless you are snooping through Keahi's room ICly, your character does not know what is written here. (and if you are snooping... let's talk about that ICly BEFORE you go RP it.)

Now then, Keahi being marked by Alex.

Keahi was first marked by Alex after Solange tried to kill Silver.  Alex's power to bring Silver back burst out and woke Keahi during the day as a Zombie.  However, this also woke Keahi's mastery powers and Keahi overcame Alex's control over him to fully awake as a vampire that day.  Since then, he's been waking during the day on his own accord.  Yet.. that one mark remained.

The second mark was given after a fight with Silver.  Lee urged Keahi to dominate Silver, and during the course of the fight, Keahi snapped Silver's back.  Grace was there and her heart stopped with fright.  Since she was already marked 4 times by Keahi... he had a little trip beyond the grave.  Yet, Alex came in and saved Grace by getting her heart beating again.  Keahi was saved by both Alex and Lee.  Alex reached out through that mark to pull Keahi back... Lee poured her blood down his throat. (Mind you, I did not agree to have Grace die on me like this OOCly.)  Anyway.. this left a second mark on Keahi by Alex. 

These marks are the same marks of a triumverate or the ones a vampire would put on an animal/human servant.  They are not able (or should not be able, imh) to be broken.  This is Keahi's flaw that was given by staff for him being a master at a young age.  However... like I said again... Keahi is a master and Alex cannot puppet him. Keahi can choose whether or not to accept an order from Alex. Keahi will choose based on what he thinks is best for his people.  It's just like any other leader coming to Keahi and saying: I want you to do this. If this is good, then Keahi will choose it. If this is bad, then Keahi will not do this.

What are the disadvantages to the bond with Alex??  It's worrisome, likely disgusting, Alex can make his life miserable.  Alex can push and push and push Keahi trying to tax his power as Keahi resists.  No, folks.. this is not something Alex is interested in ICly.  Alex does not want to rule the vampires.  Alex even told Keahi to ""Go rule your people. Be a good leader to them.""  All Alex does not want is a war that will kill a bunch of innocents.  Keahi agreed to consult Alex about wars he starts, but never did he give Alex the ability to decide if that war happens or not.  Keahi agreed to seek advice.  Alex does not have the rubber stamp of approval.

What are the advantages of the bond between Keahi and Alex?  Keahi has an extra source of power.  He can draw upon Alex's power for strength.  As Alex grows in power, Keahi also grows in power. Keahi can taste food through Alex when he sits at dinner with the man.  There is a longing to be in physical contact with Alex, but this longing does not mean that Keahi's will is given to the man. 

What did Keahi do wrong with the scene that prompted the last LJ post?  Keahi realized that he should not have given into Alex's power. That is all Keahi did was -LET- his power given into Alex's. All the while his words were this:  Alex, as much as being would desire to give into you, I cannot. I have a people that I must rule, and I cannot bend knee to you. I cannot let you rule me or rule my people.

Alex replied ICly:  I do not want you to bend knee to me.  I do not want to rule your people. That is your job. We share this city.  It is mine and yours.

Now.. what Alex means here is this: I am the peacemaker and I keep preter groups from destroying this place.

What Keahi means is: I am the Master of the City. The vampires are mine.

Thus... they can both claim the city as theirs with these two different meanings of what 'my city' means.

So folks, relax.  The Master of the City is NOT a puppet of the necromancer and executioner.

If you have any other worries or concerns, please -ask- me about them.  If you want to know the logic behind what Keahi is doing politically, please ask.  He's in control of things."

Faith is having a break down. I should go check on her. I've taken Flame out there to the ranch to hang out with Jess and Jazz, plus he can do his work as a therapy dog with Faith. Should be good for them both. He loves her. 

Gracie.. just wow. She's been here for me as strength and love for the last week or so now. Despite the break up and the celibacy and all that, she's really coming into herself again. She's doing things like cleaning my room (which she doesn't have to do!).  She's really just being there for me and we're becoming friends again.. or maybe we're becoming friends for the first time. All I know is I like it.

As for these gaurds.. I swear if they follow her around when she's with me, I'll bust them a few times. I can take care of my animal servant, thank you very much! IF I can take care of the City, she's a piece of cake.

"event","I talked with Mama a few days ago.  She came by the Sanctuary for something and I had been in her room. It tears me apart that we are growing farther and farther away from each other.  These sacrifices that we make for this city.  I hope the city appreciates it.

She is defeated and backed into a corner fighting to survive. I can feel it.  She was pushing Alex to master m; afraid that I will be unbalanced without him.  I have not had him near for almost a year. Why do I need him now?  Beyond that, I am more powrful than he. He cannot hold me. Even so... if he were to gain mastery over me, then that would make me his puppet, and would make him Lee's puppet... thus, she could control the City. Which she has. She did well at it, but now?? It would not be fair nor proper of me to do that to my people. 

Thus, it could be seen as a challenge. Do I kill her for that? Could I kill her?  Currently, as much as I hate to admit it, I could. I don't want to though.  I wish she'd Oath to me. I'm afraid to ask my Maker for such a thing. To shame her in such a way... but it is her choice. She can continue to push me and force my hand, or she can come support me and ride upon the lvoe I have for her.

That's another thing.  I am not running Court as all vampires do. I run this Court not as a tyrant in which my people serve me like slaves, but rather... my people serve me because I serve them through my leadership.  I lead them with love and imagination.  A protector against all the unseen horrors they have experienced. A place where they feel cherished and desired. Well.. I hope anyway. It might not work, but I'd rather die trying to lead like this than lead with the hand of cruelty.  Even in all this, I shall remain just.  Mercy is for the weak.  Grace is given once and when asked.  Justice is what people expect. It is far easier to get permission from me than forgiveness. By this method, my people will not be afraid of me. They can come ask for the world.... but step across my rules, and BOOM. I'll slapped them back into place.

Well.. beyond that, Gabriel has marked his servants a 4th time. This is good. He is happy, and that's all that matters. Though I think I should get him a muzzle for that rat of his. Mark bit my vampire! I would go cause complaint, but.. Mark thinks Gabriel belongs to him. And well, I don't feel like arguing differently.  After all, I get guards during the day and a deep seated alliance between us. Yeah.. Mark can think what he want.  Even if Gabriel belongs to him on paper; he's still my vampire. Or rather, I'm still his master. 

Speaking of which, Gabriel taught me a new power trick!  This will make challenges much easier!  The trick is this: I can draw power from all my vampires; especially my masters. It'll cost them, leave them a little tired afterwards, but to defend the city?? It's worth it. It should be enough that I can resist Alex's pull upon me.  POssibly even break the bonds between him and I... or so the theory goes. We'll see. 

Erec is now married. Gosh I don't ever want to go through one of those! It's sickingly sappy love.

Zadkiel... I really need to sit my boy down. He's got a boy that is um.. addicted to him. It's way bad. Well, things will work out in the end."

"event","Lee called out of the blue.  She asked me to bring dinner over for Alex. It was a weird request, so I went. i did not know what she wanted. Even now I am not sure.

We talked about Court and various things, until Alex openned up more and started talking with me. It's rare I get to talk with the man who holds my bond as master. Then he went and did it. He told me that this was HIS city and that HE would not allow a war and he would kick my ass if I started one.

What he doesn't understand is that there are times that wars must be waged for the protection of others. There are times that it is just and right to start a war. If the time ever comes, i will show him. 

Then something happened that he had never done. He went to strike me, but I blocked. After that.... power to power. Lee was supporting him in this, as I had Grace. The problem is: A servant cannot fight his master for long. Oh I tried!! I just knew that if I failed, Lee would look upon me as weak for bowing my knee to him. yet, I could not hold him. i gave way as he ripped that bond between us opened for the first time and his power coursed through me. That delicious and delicate power of knowing I belonged to him completely. I gave.

i admitted to sharing the city with him. i admitted that I would seek his council before I started a war. I gave him myself as we came to an undertanding of the boundaries and messed up order between us.

Who is my master? Feather asks. Who is my master? I ask.  I regret that I must admit that it is Alex, even though he is a shitty master and not worthy......

Is he not? He did not abandon me when Yaminah came to test me. He was there that night allowing me to feel his power and stroking through my hair when I needed to feel his love to gain strength. He was... even after Silver died, he was there. I did not know that for about a month, but it was him that brought my mother back to me. It is because of him that she lives.  And now, even now after he blew through all my defenses and had every right to punish me, he is promising to be there. Can I trust this?? Can I trust this man that took my lover away from me???  Deep inside, if I listen to my heart and my power, I want to. I want to yield and let this one thing be right. He will not die after they take the fourth mark. But can he.. will he be able to be my master? Will he be able to see I am broken and need the strength of his love as my friend and master? yes, he will protect me. Maybe that will be enough.

After all these months... I finally ache for him, but I am afraid to love him and afraid to trust his promise to be here when I need him.  Damn twist of fate!! I was fine without looking to that hole in my power, and now? Lee must have done this on purpose. She broke that hole open wide and I ache. not only does my heartache again for that which I lost with her, but it aches for the nearness of Alex. 

And here I am... Master of the City, and wanting to submit to my Master. Wanting to feel him near and trust that he will not abandon me like all my other masters have done. My parents at 8. My Mama just months ago. It would be safer to put my trust in The Dragon. She is pleased with me and thrilled over what her young, impatient child has become.

I never wanted any of this.... maybe it would have been better to die in that house fire when I was 8.

(later)

More thought about Alex as master.  This sucks that the power of the city rests upon my shoulders and is all in the control of Lee and Alex, who do not rule. Am I their puppet, then? How can Mama betray me like this and not control her servant?

Perhaps the best thing to do is send Alain to assassinate her. As much as I'd hate to lose her, I am Master of this City. She must realize this and so must Alex. It'd have to be swift, and after the 4th mark.  Else I could lose Alain.  One dagger placed just right during a moment's of passion would do the trick. No, send both the angels. Mama misses them. Sure, their death would possibly be my death, but perhaps the risks are worth it. My people before myself.  That is the way things should be. My people deserve better than this. Even if the hands of the city end up in Morte d'Amore's hands with Gabriel riding behind Lily. Or... if the city is in Belle Morte's hands under Gabriel's rule. 

I might survive it, but be highly weakened. I would have to submit to the master that took over. Then swallow my pride and make formal request for that Master's protection. Gabriel would not be a bad man to serve. He'd be gentle with me and love me. He'd see that my needs were met and try to fix that which is broken within me. I trust my lover like that, even if I'd hate to make this choice. 

(later)

Even another thought, can I escape Alex by oathing to The Dragon? I could write and ask her to oath her. I'm sure she'd accept and either send for me or come to me for such. WOuld that help balance the marks upon my soul that Alex has placed there? 

Yes, maybe death is better than this stifled hand I lead with. Damn the day I became a master."

It's Friday.  I held New Moon court last night.  There were more announcements than I thought there would be.

~Two new vampires under my leadership.  One under the church.
~Kit has let Esmerelda go as a pomme de sang. What is up with that?
~I have had a challenger, and there will likely be more.
~This Halloween Ball thingy is likely going to get jumped by HFers. I'm gonna need to go to protect my people.
~Azura's stalker is a werelion now. He is out and on the loose. She really should deal with him.

And on top of that, a surprise messenger from The Dragon brought me a letter written in blood.  It is as follows:
<lj-cut>
The envelope and the letter itself are made of parchment done in a very old style. While the paper itself may not be old, the method for creating it is. The lettering on the envelope and letter itself is in a dark reddish color, as if written in blood and dried. The seal would be one known to be that of Dragon's. The handwriting is sharp and dangerous looking.

Keahi Windriver
Master of San Francisco
Son of The Dragon

My ambitious fledgling,
         Your letters both found their way to me without incident. Patience is apparently not one of your virtues if you felt the need to send the second before the first had been answered. 
         The ashes of Belle Morte's treasonous offspring pleased me. The nature of his crimes, while heinous, are of naught to me. What truly causes my ancient heart to rage with glee is the triumph of my progeny, even if his wings are barely dry enough for a virgin flight. It is good to know that the inferno that is my power burns so brightly in such a new vessel.
         The hope that briefly flickered within me for your conquests was given pause with your next question. What care would I have of Padma's filthy animals? If this Solomon Black was so careless as to discard his Pomme de Sang, it is fully within your purview to claim it as your own, or if it is not worthy of feeding dragon's child, simply dispose of it as the wasted chattel it likely is. 
         Now, the final matter you present to me is, at last, something worthy of my attention. Of course you have my permission and encouragement to blaze forth across the land and claim all that is worthy of being within your talons. War is the fire in which our kind is truly tempered into the weapon that sears through life and death. My only caution to you would be to learn from the mistakes of history. While you are surely as new as the night that my children arose to this evening, even you should be educated enough to study the failings of mortal men who attempted to fight on two fronts. Take all that you can, but do not leave yourself vulnerable.

Grace was beautiful last night, and I enjoyed the dance with her. Then I got to see my boy again. I really need to talk with him.  Jolene... that poor Lupa. I'm having to bite at the bits to go chew the wolves out about respecting her more as the mother of the pack. She's hurting and there's not much I can do to stop it. I'm trying to be as comforting as possible, but I'm not Zane. Well.. even Grace proved to me that I'm not Zane. I swear for all the magical ability that he has to fix problems, I want to smack him about now for not caring for the one closest to him. then again, I don't understand every detail of what's happening. I just see the girl crying.  Jocelyn is also released from being a pomme. She fed me last night. Sweet girl, but... she comes on way too strong for my tastes. I hope there can be happiness for her now as she goes back to the things she enjoys. ONCE every TWO weeks."

Better yet, I'm a DRAGON!  And then there's Lee and Gabriel and Alain and Lily and Azura (yeah, she's a master too) and Hariel and Sophie and... do they really want to mess with me when I have the love of all these masters?!?! Really now, if they did not like me leading, I would have my blood spilled already.  Stupid people.

Yet, from the fight, I learned something the sky is BLUE  with fluffy white cluds, and the sunshine is very very bright. Don't look at it. It's bad.


Oh, another thing:  Grace is beautiful!!  She really is. I can't wait to see how lovely she is when her healing gets farther along. She's strong and powerful. She's a support when said stupid vampires come to my city.  She even was doing things for others without me asking. Stuff expected of an animal servant. It was the weirdest, but most awe-inspiring thing. Whatever Zane is doing to help is working.  Oh, she'll be at Court with me, In a lovely red slinky dress! I can't wait. I should buy her flowers that night and remind myself to tell her she's pretty. 

Note to self: Do that!

Madison got shot. I just... LKAJLRFjHF:OI!!!!!!  There will be hell to pay for some idiot hurting MY wolf. GRR!  I took her a white rose and curled up in bed with her for awhile. She is going to be just fine. I've missed just hanging out with her and making her know I love her. No.. not that kind of love. She's like a little sister. 

Finally... Mama. She came buy as well. Guess she needed to check on her boy. She looked me over for a few moments.  Then after seeing how tense I was, she came to touch me. We talked for awhile. SHe ade it clear that she is proud of me; even if she's bitter.  She's still the beautiful woman I have grown up with. Damn fate, time, and whatever else denies us from showing each other that love. I want to kick Alex in the rear. I was there first!! She choose me, and becaues of him, she can't have me. It's really sad. But we laughed alot too. IT was a good time. A time when neither of us worried about who ran the city or who was in charge. Just worried about the love we share. I love you, Mama. I always will."

<lj-cut>
At the end of the night, I lay here upon snow white fur in the safe temple of my priest.  Every ruler needs a place to hide away from the lies all around them. They need a place of truth, where reality is all that is present. Honesty is more honorable than the rankings and laws of the land.  A place where the ruler can hear the harsh things about life, and be allowed to weep.  This priest of God lays here next to me writing in his own journal, yet does he understand how precious he is to me? He is worth more than all the diamonds and gold this world has to offer. Just as he is right now. it's not about love or sex or the beauty of the way he lays there writing with his snow white hair falling over his body in waves of the heavenly.  It is his soul, his faith, and the service he so willingly offers to me that makes him worth far more than the kingdom of his creatrix. No, she could never give me a fair exchange for him.  He is worth more than all her children. And he'd scold me for saying so. He'd scold me even more for my views that he is already a saint. He belongs with his God when this world ends. If his God will not take him, then there is no god. For despite all the evil things he might do, he is still ever faithful to his beliefs and seeks not to harm, but heal the brokenness of this world.  Surely that will earn him his crown in heaven.

I did not know what I came seeking this night, but what I found was... confession.  That word is foreign upon this tongue of mine.  For all choices in life are good or bad. Good choices lead to good. Bad choices lead to evil. We do not have this thing called sin and guilt. All things have consequences.  Yet this night, I come to confess my failures.  My failure to lead this city as I should, and the guilty upon my shoulders. I came to pay penitance.

My back still aches and burns reminding my of my brother's lessons. I thought I was paying for my failure in not living up to my mother's expectations of me, but what I paid for was not living up to the best of my ability and not living into my position as Master of the City.  I will always be a failure in my mother's eyes now.  For if I am the good son, showing her the respect and honor a child should to a mother, then I disappoint her by not being a good Master.  If I am a good Master, not bending my knee to her, then I am a bad son. I'm damned either way in this viewing.  My word is law, and I must have confidence that I am making the right decisions for my people. I must rule by my heart and my mind, so that I can protect them.

There were two fires upon a log and they danced as one. Left, right, sway, and back. Each kept time with each other and matched each other with perfect ease as the first led the second. Left, right, sway, and back. Then spin... and the log broken into two pieces. What connected them was now keeping them apart. Still they danced on in the pattern they knew so well. Left, right, sway, and back. Spin, then leap. Only the second one did not leap when the first one did. Instead, the second one spun and second time and began to alter the dance. each step to vary farther than the first until they could no longer dance the same dance and the Second was now struggling to lead the first. Spin, turn, leap, and left. Right, back, sway, and bow. Dissonance like a loud clanging symbol. Even still, as one watched, there was knowledge learned. each fire while fighting the other danced their own inticing dance. Each as beautiful as the other; yet different.  

That is the way it is. Different. My people follow me well, and I must lead them as such. I owe it to them to live into this role called Master. 

The dawn draws near.

When I think of heaven...
Deliver me in a black-winged bird
I think of dying
Lay me down in a field of flame and heather
Render up my body into the burning heart of God
In the belly of a black-winged bird
Don't try to bleed me
I've been here before
And I deserve a little more...

I belong in the service of the Queen
I belong anywhere but in between
She's been crying and I've been thinking
And I am the Rain King."

What's up with me? I still like her and miss her. Having her over to help her with the Dragon went poorly, but we actually got to get things off our chests. I still feel like I'm a monster. But, at the same time, she's really getting better. She'll be with me at Court, and that's good. 

But Sophie... my gosh that woman is crazy!!  She let me pilot her ship tonight. It was the neatest thing. I felt on top of the world.  It was lovely. Of course, tormenting Charles was even better. He wants to be a dragon, can he handle our lifestyle?  So far.. yes."

Wrote Grace a few days ago and then she came over. That was nice. Pleasant. Maybe it'll last? I won't hold my breath, even though it won't matter for me. She curled up and we just talked about things. She offered to feed me as well!! I've missed the taste of her blood. in some ways, I miss her. In others... well, she needs to get better.

Sophie called and asked for my time. She took me to the square to move about. Then she dragged me in this hat store and made me try on all kinds of hats. She bought me this purple furry hat with a wide brim and a feather off the back. It's hidious!!!  The stuff I go through.. for her smile and laugh.

Mama came into my rooms the other night livid. She was angry about the foxes and backhanded me. She backhanded the Master of the City.  I could have cried. She thinks I'ma horrible Master. I do everything wrong in her eyes, but my people seem to like me well enough. Or.. at least they tell me they do. She walked out on me once more. I never understood what it was until talking to Frank. erec thinks Mama a slave driver and thought she treated them like pets. Horrible lies. No wonder she was angry. i went to Erec. I hope he goes to smooth things out. Tell her thank you and he's sorry. Maybe.. likely not.

Azura found me near dawn crying. She's a good vampire. Came in and curled up with me to let me know that she thinks I'm doing okay. We talked about what she could do to help Mark give her permission for a new pomme de sang. It was good to see her smile and happy. She really does care about those two rats. 

Madison helps too. She's just so shy!! even around me.  

Oh. I went to the Melange again. There was this lady there named Lela. She was incredible and had a great sense of humor. She didn't know I was a vampire until I told her after we danced. Then she stood there stunned and shocked. Though she still came to talk to me again. So I must have not scared her too much. The trouble is that she doesn't know who I am. I went in my goth gear and called myself Kanga. I'll have to be careful when the phone rings not to blow my cover. Though i'm sure she'll find out soon enough. She calls me Roo now. Kinda cutesy for the Master of the City, but I like it. Also, I need to wear my goth gear around Mama one day. She'd flip. It'd be great?? maybe. If she's no longer pissed at me. grr...

Finally,  Amber.  She's leaving on Friday. getting recalled. She called and I went over to find her packing. I did the only thing I knew to do at that point.. asked her to go sing the flames with me again. And we did sing them. Fire all night. I'm sure the siren will be quiet for at least a week after that. Wow. Just.. Wow. That's all I have to say about those moments when I could see nothing but the siren dancing for me.

(written upon a golden yellow colored paper, and likely took all that stationary, the letter is slipped inside a red envelope. The whole letter smells like and him and for a letter, it likely weighs a book. It's delivered to the apartments and rests on the floor like it was slipped under her door.)

Grace,

        Thank you for the card and for the release to see other people. I know this time between us is rough right now. I am not really sure what made you pull back like you did. One month you complain I am too gentle and the next month I am a monster. There is likely more going on than what I see or what I can help with. You are in over my head and I drown with you in these nights of confusion.
        The song is rather appropriate. I cannot live without you as you are tied to me mind, soul, and power. It is a choice we made and only time will tell if we were right to make it. I know it was a decision made in passion. A beuatiful moment between us. One that has linked us together until the stars fall from the sky.
        And yet, now, I cannot live with you. I do not have the time to dedicate to helping you through this ordeal. I won't lie to you, I wish I could be there to hold you through this, but I can't. I have a city to maintain. Master of the City is a great honor, but a great responsibility. I have hundreds of vampires who count upon me to maintain order and to be there when they get in a bind. I must make sure they are all safe and have endless diplomatic arrangements. I am sorry that I cannot be there to see you through this or give you the time needed to be at your side through this storm. However, I am not shutting you out. I'm only a thought away from you at any time; just call out my name, and I'll be there in your mind. I do still love you, Grace.
        Yet, I cannot be a rock for you right now. My heart feels like a dagger has stabbed it and it bleeds. I need the time for the scars to heal it before I can be anything firm for you again. Just like you, I have abandonment issues. The rocky waters where the waves crash back and forth are too much to bear for a man with my job. I can barely hang onto the side of the ship and not drown from my own issues. I do not know how to help you, and I don't think I can; even if I did. We are too close for me to be a rock for you during this storm. Your rocking causes my boat to rock more than it already is. Your pain is my pain. Your hurt is my hurt. How can I be steady when I love you so deeply that I feel the rocking of your boat?
        I also have my own rocking boat to deal with. Recently, you have not been the only one torn by pain. In that one moment when I gained the whole city, I lost many whom I loved and stood alone facing a city that would tear me down. I am a young Master; both young for my power and too young to hold a city this size. I am doing the best I can, and that does not appear to be good enough. In your pain, I would have held you had you come to me with your pain. Yet, at the same time, I needed you to hold me. And needed you to be my rock.
        I know you are afraid and in pain right now, and that is why I do not welcome you back as my lover. You need this time to work through what is going on in your life. This is a trial for you. The test is this: can you face what you fear and move through it? No, I don't mean physically stand up to what you are afraid of, but rather, can you let yourself trust what Zane is telling you and follow his light to the end. You are surrounded in love by your pack, and you have my love as your friend and your master. There is strength in love. That strength is that when life kicks you, you know you have people who will hold you through it. While I might not physically hold you through it, I am always here just a thought away. If you need to test me on this, go ahead. Just call my name, and I will respond, ""I am here."" Do this over and over again throughout the night until you have learned that it is truth. Let yourself feel safe and let this nightmare pass. I know it won't take a night or even a week to pass. I know this is easier said than done. yet, you are a strong woman at your core. You have strength to continue walking in the face of the worst. You have proven this. I am proud of the work you've done with Zane these last months or weeks. Please continue it. Please continue working through all these issues so that you can be complete and whole again. So that you can enjoy life and smile again.
        Also, because of these issues you are working through, I am putting your duties as my animal servant to the side. No Courts or anything like that. All of these responsibilities will be waiting for you when you are rested and able to take the burden upon your shoulders again. Part of those duties as my servant is being able to hold me in the times when I need to cry. To be my strength when I am weak. You are to be the wind beneath my wings that makes me soar. Your focus should be what makes me look good in the eyes of other vampires. What makes me look strong. You are supposed to be my strength. Right now, you are in a frighting place and cannot be that support for me. Your walls are crumbling and you can barely hold yourself up. It is wrong for me to expect you to do this for me. This is no failing of your own. This is that bitch's doing... yeah, that one. I hate her, and I'm glad she's dead. She weakened your ability to be strength right now. It's her fault, not yours. So right now, for myself and for you, I am asking that you sit in the comfort of your pack and heal the wounds. You will be stronger for it afterwards.
        I know that you fear me. I know that it is scary that I enjoy things that no mortal can think to enjoy. I have very good control over my powers. That bitch did not. Her powers rode her and killed her. When you get better, then I will teach you how to ride the dragon. How to soar with what is now inside you. Do not fear the rage, my wolf. It is beautiful when you control it and ride it. It goes where you want it to; rather than you going where it chooses. You choose when it comes out and when it must remain hidden. It is good, my sweet woman. It is good. Just trust me on this one for now. I am still your dragon and always will be your dragon... until the stars fall from the sky.
        Finally, dear one, I thank you for freein' me ta be with who I want. I have given Kai my blessing to be with you. He has likely told you such. I hope that he can make you happy in ways that I could not. I hope he can be for you what I cannot. He is human and will one day pass on through this life, but may you show him happiness while he walks this earth. May you look back in the years to come and remember him with fondness. Make him be a lucky one that knows true love. I wish the best for you both.
        Don't take everything I said literally or physically. They are words I am using to try to express to you my thoughts, and it has been a rough night for me. Take care of yourself, Gracie. And if you get nothing else from this long book into my thoughts, know this: I do love you. There will be an again, but I don't know what that will look like or when it will be. We have time. We have until the stars fall. Rest now, and learn to smile again. Truly smile again.

        Love,
        ~Keahi

"event","I've finally calmed down enough to write.

Grace sent yet another goodbye letter. 

Alain says this is for reasons of needing closure, but really.. does one need to send such letters for closure without considering the one they are sending them to?

Closure.
#1 - fly all the way across the country to break up with me leaving me embarassed, humiliated, and looking weak in front of my mentors and other masters. I'm now waiting for Masters to enter the city of San Francisco and try to take it from me. As if being a young MotC isn't enough reason for them to do such!
#2 - When I came over, she started going all unresponsive. When I tried to help by letting her know I was there... I, the dragon, who defends her and protects her, I get shoved away by Zane and it's her family that helps her out. I shouldn't be upset about it, because she is getting help, but that hurt. It hurt to have her afraid of me and not want me there.
#3 - A letter. Sent to the Kiss; not the restuarant I own or to my Renfield. Eddie brought it to me, and it was another letter to give closure. Well, damnit, woman. I'm leaving you alone. Can't live with me or without me. Well, you know, I'm in the same boat. Profess love and then say you're afraid of me. Yeah.. that's love. The set me free!?!?!?! You did that when you left me in Roanoke. I had no jurisdiction in regards to you dating Kai. He wanted my blessing and I gave the little man my blessing to see you happy. Despite I don't think you are ready for a relationship right now. And thus... you feel the need to send me a letter and slap me once more.

*sighs* There really is only so much abuse that one person can take. I understand that she's been tortured and that she's not healed. But does that excuse her from causing me all kinds of pain? Does that mean that I should stand there like a rock and weather the beatings? The pushing me away and then saying she wants me... then pushing me away again? She knows I have abandonment issues. Every time she does this it rips at thta wound upon my own heart. Just because my wound is like getting cut by a knife and not a shattered wall, does that mean I should endure having the scab ripped off time and time again? 

Time and time again to go seek out my lovers arms to cry upon their shoulders when my heart aches? Do my lovers deserve being constantly used as a cry bucket? 

I'm having a hard time with this. I want to help Gracie, but there has to be a line drawn with how far I let myself hurt. And with this, I say no more. It's time for happiness. It's time for my lovers to see me laugh and smile and dance. It's time to go out with that cute Dragon to do Dragonish pirate things like sing bawdy songs until the dawn breaks!  

As King, I have so many too look after. Azura with her stalker. Sophie with her trouble making. My lovers with their hearts. Sho and his strange family situation. Great Spirit, prevent them from starting a war!! Realtionships between various factions... training up of the young. Answering questions from those that ask them.


Oh... and finding time to go bear witness to Mama marking Alex for a 4th time. Yay!!!  That has been the single BEST news this week. I shall have my Master and my Maker until the stars fall from the sky.

PS. remind myself to do something nice for Madison. She's a sweet pomme that has taken up the slack of trying to feed me every day. I hate to tell her thta I'm going to get extra from others so as not to tax her. I need another pomme!!  

PSS. Remind myself to wake Gabriel up like that again. His face was extrordinarily beautiful to know his lover was there! 

PSSS. Think of something to do for Alain. Oh.. I know. Write Alain a letter outlining all the reasons why I love him. Or course, that might take me a month to do."

"event","""My hand to yours
Let out spirits run free
Let our souls intermingle
For brothers of blood are we.

My life for your own
Your truth for my lie
When we walk we are one
And thus together we'll die.""

My brother sang me this to soothe my raging soul.  Why is he so good to me? Do I truly deserve his loyalty and his devotion?

I struggle lately with knowing the truth about myself. Who am I? The person I see is one who enjoys hurting others and enjoys the violence of the world. A man tempered with the knowledge that the violence is wrong, but when it is right, I get high off it. I always thought I was a gentle soul, but is that the truth? I'm beginning to think it isn't. I still believe that I'm fair and just. Even if those who are condemned perhaps are given a punishment far worse than the offense. Am I seeing myself through the wolf in me, and therefore struggling with the vampire? The wolves seems to hate me and consider me evil. Maybe I am.


Then there is the other side of the coin. My people seem at ease around me. They tease me more than any other Master would allow. Perhaps I should line them all up and tan their hides one night. Unfortunately, most of them would take it as me loving them and cause more trouble just to get me to do it again. 

I just don't know anymore. Life just is."

<lj-cut>
Spend all your time waiting for that second chance
For the break that will make it OK
There's always some reason to feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction or a beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins
Let me be empty and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the Angels far away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room, and the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the Angels; may you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line, and everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting, you keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference, escaping one last time
It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness, oh this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

In the arms of the Angels far away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room, and the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie
In the arms of the Angels; may you find some comfort here

You're in the arms of the Angels; may you find some comfort here 
</lj-cut>

My angels kidnapped me last night and took me to some enchanted place.  There were three triplet boys that were all beautiful, but I paired off with Jason for feeding. He likes dragons, and I'm hoping to get him to draw me a dragon.  The night was extremely lovely.  My brother... i haven't seen that look in his eyes before. That fear that was mirrored in my eyes. I asked them not to fight over me. There was no need. I wanted them both with me. That seemed to ease my brother and as his tears fell, mine did too. As he laughed, I couldn't help but laugh as well. We are whole again, my brother and I. Well, as whole as we both can ever get. When the dawn came, I found myself between the angels. Their wings to shelter me from the harsh light of day. It was a good evening, and I will have to figure out how to thank them both."

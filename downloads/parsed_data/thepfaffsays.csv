"event","My mom called last night to make sure I was okay. Not because of the shootings, persay, but rather because the shooter was a Korean male, and so am I. She told me to watch out for people holding animosity towards me, to watch out for people throwing stuff at me. I didn't think anything of that, until I went <a href=""http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003670968_shootasian18.html"">online</a>. Apparently, a lot of Korean Americans are <strike>afraid</strike> worried right now about the backlash against the Korean-American peoples.<br /><br />It's strange.<br /><br />I'm not afraid of anything happening to me, but something tells me I should keep my eyes open and stay alert. We'll see.<br /><br />edit: So. A woman came up to me today and asked, ""You are Korean?"" I said yes, and she tried talking to me in Korean. I was like, no, no, I don't speak Korean, I was adopted.<br /><br />She asked me if I knew about the events that had happened in Virginia, and if they knew if he was mentally ill. I told her what I knew, and then she started telling me about her time in Virginia. How she was often looked at differently, and often felt uncomfortable. She told me that here it was much better, and that I probably didn't get much of it here. It was interesting, because we pointed out that the shooter's name is always followed by the fact that he's from South Korea. She said that because I'm so outgoing and willing to talk, and because the shooter was so shy, that when he got those looks from people he probably never asked why or tried to make friends.<br /><br />She told me that it was good that I speak English so well, and that I should tell people that Korean-Americans are not bad, that this is an isolated event that just randomly happened. <br /><br />After our Xavier lunch, Amy and I put our marks on a poster for the Hokies. We were talking about how we are exactly like those people in Virginia. Someone who was killed was a sophomore English major. Hey. Sound familiar? And so it's all just really strange to think about. I'm kind of having a strangely tough time with all of this.<br /><br />And the lame thing is, is that I don't have many Asian-American friends, which I've never really cared about. But the big thing there is that no one else can understand what I'm going through. Weird, huh? It's kind of lonely."

"event","I'm reading a book called ""Wild Minds"" and I read a short sentence over mortality and evolution, and, basically, I am afraid of mortality, and the idea that one day we will just cease to exist.

Heaven, sure, may exist. But it's definitely the fear of the unknown, and the almost obivousness that we, who is all we are, will one day be nothing and nothing forever. Our flesh and nuerons and blood will all sink into the dirt and break down into food for scavengers. 

I heard that some philosophers believe that we are a part of God, and one day we'll be with God, as God. But the idea of eternity scares me, also.

Death is a crazy thing. It caused me to run out of my room, heart skipping, and freak out.

Ian Jamieson is President, Casey Hart is Vice President, Josh Kohl is Finance, Catherine Stout is Spiritual, Ruth is Communications, Tim is NCC, and Eric Pfaff is... your new PLU RHA EJD! (Environment, Justice, and Diversity Director)

Needless to say, I'm excited. Not only does that mean I can bring my passion of the E, J, and D to PLU, but I also get a room in South Hall for only $150 a month. Which will be very nice.

Not I.

My next goal is to become a member of RHA. Hopefully EJD or Communications. Mostly because I want to, and partly because it will drop kick the South Hall price from about $560/month to only $130/month for electricity, Internet, cable, heat, water... everything.

Just what any university student needs. I got it while buying a new betta fish, so I named my fish ""Bloopie."" This morning, and returning to PLU, I think my average speed (inc. the 70mph zones) was about 60mph. I drove slow.<br /><br />Last night, Ticon called and asked, ""So, are we going to Bellingham tomorrow?"" I said that would be excellent, so we met at the UC at 9:30 for breakfast. Dyno walked in and we asked her if she wanted to come. 10:30 and all three of us were up to the great North. We ended up at Scooter's house, even though no one had picked up their cellphones. We knocked and Scooter answered. We went to lunch at the Colophon Cafe. We then looked for Topple--we drove to his house and he wasn't home. As we headed back to Scooter's, who did we see? Topple. We pulled up, threw him in Indiana, and then we high-tailed it to the Pita Pit/Starbucks. After that, we went to Scooter's and chillaxed, then Squircle called. We picked her up, went food shopping, and then made pasta with sauteed onions/peppers with garlic bread and it was delish. And now I'm back at PLU. A bunch of people went to Bertillinos, but I shouldn't spend anymore money for a while.<br /><br />For my roommate's birthday I went in 50/50 on a video game called Kingdom Hearts II which is an amazing game where you get to fight/be in the worlds of Disney characters such as Simba, Donald Duck and Goofy, Aladdin, Ariel, Beauty and the Beast, etc. Pretty bomb.com, but I already beat it. Which is okay because Kendall also got a Wii for his birthday, so that'll be pretty fun. <br /><br />After two years of being co-President of Circle K, I broke off from that and am now the Treasurer. Good times, good rhymes.<br /><br />My classes are great. Environmental Politics and Policy, my 300-level political science class that I thought would be incredibly difficult, well, isn't. Yet, at least. The professor is neat and I know all about his family/other random stories from his life. Philosophy, Animals, and the Environment will be a fun class also. I'm glad I'm double-majoring with Environmental Studies. Kristi also joined that class, which makes it a lot more fun/distracting. Spanish 202 is a beast of a class. It'll be my toughest one of the semester. Special Topics in Children's Literature is going to be great. We just finished up ""A Christmas Carol"" and are going to read an excerpt from Peter Pan for Tuesday. <br /><br />And finally, I decided that I'm going to live in South. Kendall Jeske, Ian Jamieson, and Brian Davis. It should be great, although it'll be strange not being close to everyone I've lived with the past one-to-two years. I may also get a cat (/sneak one into South).</div><br />The important things (Cliff's notes of... my entry...)<br />1. Next year I'm going to live in South Hall with Kendall, Ian and Brian Davis.<br />2. Classes are good, but tough.<br />3. Next year I'll be the Treasurer of Circle K.<br />4. I want to be RHA EJD.<br />5. I got my first speeding ticket and another fish.<br />6. Bellingham today was good times."

"event","The last week has been strange in a sense--<i>everyone</i>, it seems, is looking at houses for next year. And by everyone, I mean almost all the non-Freshmen. So here's the dillemna: Do I stay in Ordal?<br /><br />Kendall asked me to move into South Hall with him, and Ian, and someone else, and that idea is seeming nicer and nicer. I'm hopefully going to be on RHA which is almost a full room stipend, which would make it cheaper than a house (only $1220 for housing for the entire year; $135 per month--for unlimited electricity, water, heat, Internet, cable). It would also be safer, and relatively close to campus. It's basically a shared apartment.<br /><br />The perks about Ordal, though, are that while many of my age people are leaving, a few are probably staying. And once you leave the residence halls, I hear it's a lot tougher to meet new people. But if I'm on RHA, I'll still have the connection with the hall and with the campus... So... I don't know. Also, housing would be FREE if I stayed in Ordal. Also, it's Ordal. And I love Ordal :-)<br /><br />So yeah."

People have gotten into some sort of lull that didn't happen last year (not as many people left for J-Term...). It's the first time I've ever felt really strange in Ordal and almost out-of-place.

But today, after dinner, Meredith, Autumn, Jeff and I sat down in the stairway at second floor and had a party for... three hours. It was amazing.

Christchurch, though despised by the rest of my group, was a wonderful city. It was very touristy, but it was incredibly friendly and fun. The bus system there was amazing. We stayed on the outskirts of town at the College of Education-Sonata and it was lovely. The Garden City, as Christchurch is known as, was well-deserved. The downtown square had a cathedral and a large, open, square. We did everything from go to the wonderful beaches (I'm so dark; a little sunburned!) to Willowbanks (a... inclusive zoo--I hugged a wallaby) to the Antartic Center (we rode a Haglund!).

The ""French Connection"" bus on Friday brought us to the French-esque town of Akaroa&nbsp;(on the Banks Peninsula) to SWIM WITH DOLPHINS. We squeezed into wetsuits and grabbed snorkels and goggles and waddled over to the boat which took us about a mile out into the harbour. Looked around and then, all of a sudden, there were dolphins. Hector's dolphins, the smallest and most endangered. We just jumped in the water, dipped our heads below the water, and started making noises like, ""Oohhheeeyyyyyyoooo."" And then they'd suddenly swim by! Two, three, inches away. They'd circle your body and then swim deep into the green water. They played with us for about an hour--it was incredible.

After dolphins and lunch, my group left... without me. The professors agreed, since I'm the only guy (the second guy who has ever been on the trip!), that I could explore on my own more often than normally would be allowed. So I checked in to a small, but very ""cute,"" backpacker's hostel called ""Chez la Mer"" that had everything from free-to-use bikes to a kitchen to a boombox with mixes from around the world. And then I went on a hike through the hills of New Zealand. It was foggy; I didn't see much. But I did get some pre-fog views of the harbour. The entire way up I was surrounded by New Zealand's famous creatures: sheep and birds. The tweeting and baa-ing filled the air (as well as the smell of sheep poo). Sheep are funny animals. It was four when I left, and it was a four and a half hour hike. I love that it is Summer here! I returned just before dark (after getting lost in thick fog). My room had five beds, and one was taken by a comical old man from the UK, one was taken from a sullen guy from Eastern Germany, and the two others were taken by a brother and sister from Australia who were just a little older than me. I made casual conversation; I dropped some stuff from the top bunk and shouted, ""LAME,"" and the Australians made fun of my use of the word. They say ""Shit"" when that kind of thing happens :-) Anyway, the Australians and I really hit it off. They were completely the stereotypical Australians: descendants of convicts and Scottish people, said ""G'day mate"" and ate Vegemite (which is gross-ish). We ended up doing everything from playing Jenga, to going to the bar and getting beer and playing pool, to reading. In the morning we read some more, visited the Akaroa Museum, bought ice-cream and took a walk to the nearby lighthouse. They were amazing--we traded e-mails so hopefully we'll stay in touch.

One week in Christchurch was all the group could take so we took a train and a ferry to the North Island. I got even darker. We had our first class where we actually did work. Class was canceled last night so we could go on a bar tour for Kelly's birthday. $25 NZ for five bars, five drinks. It was awesome; I met a guy named Ollie and he bought me like eight drinks or something insane (he was definitely hitting on Emily and... me? Awkward turtle... but he was cool). Anyway, it was a fun night and I met people from all over. Since I'm the only guy I was a ""cock-block"" and also made sure all the girls got home. Eventually it was me, Ollie, two of his friends, chilling outside of a bar at four in the morning. I went to sleep, woke up at seven, and we went to the library to research Children's literature. And here I am now. Researching.&nbsp;

That's all for now. Pictures will come when I return."

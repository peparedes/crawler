A friend of mine is looking for a new roommate in her apartment on Parkside Ave. in Brooklyn near the Q train.  The rent is $750/month + utilities.  You'd have your own bedroom and share living room & kitchen.  She's a very interesting and fun person.

If you're interested, let me know right away and I'll put you in touch with her."

""As many as 5,000 children in Pennsylvania have been found guilty, and up to 2,000 of them jailed, by [Ben's edit: at least] two corrupt judges who received kickbacks from the builders and owners of private prison facilities that benefited. The two judges pleaded guilty in a stunning case of greed and corruption that is still unfolding.""

"event","Edit: So this Tuesday is obviously December 2nd and not the November date that was here earlier.  That's what I get for trying to cut, paste, and edit when I'm sleep deprived.

Here's the corrected version

I've been doing a lot more teaching than performing lately.  In addition to this series, over the last year I've gotten to teach CircleSinging and Vocal Improvisation workshops in Boston, the Catskills, Maine, West Virginia and Washington State (where I'll be again next month, this time teaching an advanced class for a group of jazz singers in Seattle).  I'm also being asked by choruses to lead CircleSinging workshops for them.  The first of those will be happening in January.  I've also been putting together a (still to be named) Vocal Improv performance group with some incredible singers.

I do have a couple of NY/NJ area performances coming up:
 
1) A house concert in a beautiful Soho loft at 1pm on Sunday, Dec. 21st.
I'll be one of the solo performers and this will also be the debut of the aforementioned Vocal Improv group.  If you're interested, you'll probably have to RSVP for at this one, so get in touch with me for details if you'd like to come.

2) I'll also be one of the performers at Wicked Faire IV: The Chocolate Factory in Whippany, NJ.  Feb. 20th - 22nd.  I'll probably be doing mostly vocal looping with some singer/songwriter stuff mixed in.

But first, this coming Tuesday will be the final evening of CircleSinging in the First Tuesday series that I've been running this Fall.  It's been a such a pleasure to do and we've made amazing, beautiful music together.  I hope to be able to get another series going soon but for the moment, this is it.  This is a completely open event. Anyone who doesn't want to participate as one of the singers can be audience.  Either way, it's a powerful experience (and some may just change their mind and join us in creating these pieces of improvised music).  
Details, a description of CircleSinging and a short bio for me <lj-cut text=""are behind the cut"">: 

Date:	
Tuesday, December 2nd, 2008
Time:	
7:00pm - 9:00pm
Location:	
Old Stone House
Street:	
336 3rd St. at 5th Ave
City/Town:	
Brooklyn, NY

There's a tiny little park on the block between 3rd and 4th Streets at 5th Ave. and you'll see the Old Stone House in the middle of it.

Circlesinging, as practiced by Bobby McFerrin and Voicestra, is a vocal improvisation technique in which a circle of singers takes melodic and rhythmic cues (parts) from a skilled leader, together creating songs unique to the moment. As the leader cues out old parts and introduces new ones, the song continues and changes without stopping, at times supporting individual solos, always grounded in attentive listening.

Ben has been teaching various forms of Vocal Improvisation and Group Singing for over two decades.  In 2005, he took a five-day master class in Circlesinging with Bobby McFerrin.  His other teachers of Circlesinging, Vocal Percussion and Vocal Improv have included David Worm and Rhiannon (including her master classes for Teachers of Vocal Improvisation) .  Ben has been a member of the Vocal Improv performance groups ""Vox Pop"" and ""The Tritones"".  His songs have been published in Carry It On, Sing Out Magazine, The Washington Post, and the book ""Hearing Everyone's Voice"".

Here are directions to get to there, courtesy of http://www.theoldstonehouse.org :

By Subway
Take the F or the R to Fourth Avenue, or the R to Union Street.

By Bus
Take the B63 Bus to Third Street and Fifth Avenue

By Car
The Old Stone House is located between Fourth and Fifth Avenues and Third and Fourth Streets in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. On street parking is available.

(Note that if you do take the F or R train to either the 4th Ave station (which is at 9th St.) or the Union St. station (which is also on 4th Ave) that you'll have to walk east (uphill) to 5th Ave. and that 4th St. doesn't go through between 4th and 5th Aves.)"

"event","How is it that SNL, after many years of being really bad and unfunny (at least on the rare occasions that I would bother to check it out) to being ridiculously funny again?  A and I must have watched this segment at least 3 times, laughing hysterically.

I'm talking about the bit they did about the AIG bailout(s) during the Weekend Update Thursday edition from October 9th.  The news facts were all real and accurate (at least as I understand them).  What's so hysterical is their reactions to those facts.  They reflected my own (and I'm sure, so many other people's) reactions, so brilliantly, that it was quite cathartic.    

The bit in question is 14 mins and 19 seconds in, which is a little over half way through the middle section.  When you click the link it'll say ""Select an episode below"".  Ignore that.  It'll then play a commercial, after which it will start playing the show.  The debate sketch at the beginning is funny enough, but old news already.  If you want to skip the earlier parts of the show, click just past the middle of the middle segment (they'll play another commercial before starting that segment, unfortunately, but at least it's short.)  Let me know what you think.  (I know; a lot of you probably saw this a month and a half ago, already.  So I'm lagging.)  I suspect that even (or perhaps, especially) the libertarians among you will be on the same page with me on this.

"event","While I'm here on LJ, it occurs to me that I should probably post something about a really cool vocal improv gig that I'm part of tonight at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe on the off chance that any of you might be able to make it at the very last minute.  Here's what my friend, Kate Richards (who I'm sitting in with along with several stellar singers), wrote up about it:

Kate Richards with Frank Wagner and Friends
Tuesday, August 19, 2008
8 PM - two sets
Nuyorican Poets Cafe
236 E. 3rd St. between Aves. B & C, New York
$10 cover, no minimum

The ""Women Take the Bandstand"" series at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe presents singer/songwriter Kate Richards with Frank Wagner on bass, and special guests, on August 19th, at 8 pm.

Kate Richards worked the New England coffee house circuit in the 90's as a solo folk artist and in a captivating duo with guitarist Jonathan Carroll (currently living in Oregon). She also collaborated with Barbara Shepard and Kriss Santala in a vocal trio in New Haven, playing Toad's Place and street festivals. After a 10-year stint as a music therapist, she returns to the stage with veteran bassist Frank Wagner of Primary Colours, www.modalmoods.com, for clear and powerful renditions of some familiar standards and a few surprises. Her originals lean toward the folk/country genre and that's where her voice soars.

For the second set, Kate will invite special guests [including Andrea Wolper, Alexis Parsons, Ben Silver, Kendra Shank, Laurie Newell, Nik Munson, Steve Sandberg, Tia Hanna] to join her for a dynamic and extraordinary improvised vocal performance. Using some of the structures they've learned from Rhiannon and Bobby McFerrin, this group will create musical compositions in the moment - 100% improvised."

I'm visiting Brooklyn on a fun summer job, and I need help with it.<br /><br />    Please help me hand out prizes this week, ASAP, August 19th-20th in <br />    Brooklyn.  Fun for an outgoing person who tends to smile and likes to <br />    talk to strangers. Technically, it's marketing, but it's fun <br />    marketing that makes people want to talk to us.  Each ""event"" is two <br />    hours long and up to 3 events can be done in one day.  The work pays <br />    $20 per 2-hour event.<br /><br />    I was scheduled to do this work early this week but <br />    my teammate is not available and I need to find replacement(s).  Ideally I need people who will commit to working 2-3 <br />    shifts on the same day, but anything is better than nothing.  All <br />    work is done between 7am-7pm (store hours).<br /><br />    The job includes identifying winners, giving away sweepstakes prizes <br />    and asking short voluntary surveys of the winners and a few <br />    non-winners.  Some of the ""events"" will be quiet/slow and some are <br />    busy/exciting (it's unpredictable). Some of the time the job is just <br />    sitting/standing around chatting and hanging out with each other <br />    and/or with the store staff, who are friendly and often offer <br />    complimentary bottled water, soft drinks and coffee.  The tasks that <br />    we do are not complicated and if you are able to talk with people and <br />    write legibly, you're qualified.  Since we are handing out prizes, <br />    you MUST be over 18 to do the job.<br /><br />    Work is outside and mostly in the shade, requires standing on your <br />    feet for most of the day.  (Rest for 15-45 minutes between the <br />    ""events,"" at our option. if you want to crank through the day and <br />    take shorter breaks, we can do that.)<br /><br />    There is a uniform. I will provide a uniform T-shirt, and I have a <br />    few sizes of men's or women's khaki pants, but it's easier if you <br />    already have your own khaki bottoms.  Shorts, pants, skirts, and <br />    cargo-style are all fine.  Wear comfortable, plain, solid-color <br />    black, brown or white closed-toe shoes. (Sorry, no pink flip flops <br />    with purple ribbons!)<br /><br />    I have a car and will drive us between locations. In some parts of <br />    Brooklyn I can even pick you up and drop you off at your doorstep. I <br />    have a cooler in my car that can be shared, and I have lots of snacks <br />    (from healthy/raw to salty/sugary/junk), which you are welcome to <br />    enjoy while you work with<br /><br />     me.<br /><br />    Please comment at <lj user=""punzel""> if you would be available to <br />    work, and include what day <br />    or days you might be available. If you know someone with a flexible <br />    schedule or who needs very short-term or IMMEDIATE employment/income, <br />    this might be just the thing to forward on to them. Your help is appreciated.<br /><br />    THANKS!<br />    <lj user=""Punzel""><br /></lj>"

I decided to wait until I had a bit more time (ha).

There were a few things that I posted here with the intention of posting follow up entries (well, many over the years) and maybe I'll still get to some of them  At least I've finally put a more current photo up (I only first shaved off my hair last August).

So, in my last entry before this, I challenged people to punctuate:  ""lucy where kwame had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher"" and I screened comments to avoid spoilers for folks that might want to figure it out (and to create some fun suspense - overkill much?).  Well, <lj user=""tactisle""> got it right away and I never got back on to unscreened his comment, which I'm about to do now.  I'm also about to put the answer in comments here, so it can be found in either place.

If the person that posted the aforementioned entry (or anyone else) sees this and is up for making any suggestions about how we talk with them to take advantage of the fact that we could just switch carriers if we wanted to at this point (and keep our numbers) if we wanted to, it would be quite welcome.  What sort of favorable terms are we in a position to ask for (lower rates than those advertised, for example)?  I'm already expecting that they'll offer us free new phones as a part of the deal for tying ourselves to them again for 2 years.

Published: April 28, 2006

President Bush said today that he thought the national anthem should be sung in English, not the Spanish language version released by a recording company recently.

The song, recorded by a chorus of Latin pop stars, is being distributed to Spanish-language radio stations to be played Monday morning to coincide with immigrant rights demonstrations that are scheduled in many cities across the nation.

Speaking to reporters in the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Bush made it clear that he considered the language difference as part of the immigration issue.

After saying he did not consider the anthem sung in Spanish to have the same value as the anthem sung in English, Mr. Bush said: ""I think people who want to be a citizen of this country ought to learn English. And they ought to learn to sing the anthem in English.""

Mr. Bush was responding to a question following the release today of the Spanish-language version of the song called ""Nuestro Himno"" or ""Our Anthem.""

Adam Kidron, the British music producer who released the song, responded to Mr. Bush's comments by saying that it was not intended ""to discourage immigrants from learning English and embracing American culture,"" according to The Associated Press. ""We instead view `Nuestro Himno' as a song that affords those immigrants that have not yet learned the English language the opportunity to fully understand the character of ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" the American flag and the ideals of freedom that they represent. Mr. Bush also addressed one of the goals of Monday's demonstrations: a show of force by immigrants who hope to demonstrate their economic power by staying home from work and boycotting stores.

""I am not a supporter of boycotts,"" Mr. Bush said. ""I am a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.""

Congress is currently wrangling over the question of how to deal with people who, though not legal residents of the country, provide vital labor in agriculture, construction and service industries.

The House of Representatives has passed a bill that would strengthen border security and make being in the country illegally a felony. The Senate has considered, but not yet adopted a milder approach, that would provide a path to citizenship for those who have been in the country the longest. Mr. Bush has said he prefers the Senate version."

Although it wasn't perfect, it seemed to go very well (the folks at the station seemed pretty excited about it anyway, and we were asked back).  The timing was right 'cause we got to plug our upcoming debut gig (I'll be posting the information about that in a while).  Well, it's kind of our debut - we did perform one song as guest artists at another group's concert (also went over very well) several weeks ago.  

I know, I should have posted something about being on the radio beforehand but I think they put archives on their website so if anyone really wants to hear it I can get you the information about how once I have it.  

By the way, what do you all think of the new userpic?  I've been really tired of the other one being the default (although I think I will use it for the upcoming gig announcement).  

Does anyone have suggestions about how to include a pdf (flyer for aforementioned gig) in a post?  I guess I have to figure out how to use LJ tags too, if I'm gonna do that.  Always more homework."

As I understand it, the memorial was going to be documented by an organization that I won't name the produces public access tv shows.  Unfortunately, it sounds as if they never called to confirm that they'll be there.

For decades, Brenda was always putting her time and energy into many important causes because she saw the need.  From GLBT activism (among many other things, she was one of the organizers of the first marches to commemorate the anniversary of Stonewall) to the anti-war movement, Brenda was there... working, educating, and soliciting support.  She cared deeply about freedom, fairness, and people and she was willing to fight passionately for what she cared about.

I'm sad that I won't be there today, that I didn't make it to her funeral, and much sadder that I didn't get to the hospital to visit with her when she was dying.

It would be a shame if this commemoration of her life didn't get documented on video.  I have a phone number to call up until the last minute if someone is available with a camera.  I'll check back here in a while to see if anyone can help but if you are able to and have my cell phone number, please give me a call.

It's a minor fracture, I believe, but what was more significant was that I broke the nail-bed.  (The nail was broken going across the middle - kinda jagged like - and had cut the flesh underneath.  It wasn't pretty.

I had surgery that evening in which the nail was removed and the area underneath was stitched.  Then (part of?) the nail was stitched back on, I think.  The anesthetic was local and once the surgeon became convinced that I really was feeling what he was doing he gave me a fourth shot.  Right into the bone this time - Big Ow!  After that, I felt tugging, the vibrations of the stitches going through, and unpleasant numbness, but not the acute pain of having my fingernail removed, etc.

Oh yeah, the ironic part... The steps I was climbing were the ones in front of the Red Cross building.  I was on my way to take a First Aid and CPR class."

On the front page of the Science Times section of today's New York Times the main article (written by one Benedict Carey) has the headline ""Straight, Gay or Lying?  Bisexuality Revisited.  Gee, it's been a little while now since some big institution in either the mainstream or queer world has loudly denied my existence - it's been kinda nice.

It seems some psychologists in Toronto and Chicago have done a study using 101 ""young adult men"" in which ""the men watched a series of erotic movies, some involving only women, others involving only men.

""Using a sensor to monitor sexual arousal, the researchers found what the expected: gay men showed arousal to images of men and little arousal to images of women, and heterosexual men showed arousal to women but not to men.

""But the men in the study who described themselves as bisexual did not have patterns of arousal that were consistent with their stated attraction to men and to women.  Instead, about three-quarters of the group had arousal patterns identical to gay men; the rest were indistinguishable from heterosexuals.""

Well I don't know what kind of ""sensor"" they were using, but I have some built in sensor equipment that has shown me different results!

Many Voices Concert (Featuring Pete Seeger) 

OK, I'm excited!  Six (6!) choruses will be performing (at the same time) a song that I co-wrote and co-arranged as the big finale of this program.  (I've written only one other choral song and the chorus that I wrote it for disbanded before ever performing it.)

I am also singing as part of a trio and then soloing during the first piece of the night, Peace Salaam Shalom as sung by a ""pick-up"" chorus of Peoples' Music Network members.  The trio will be introducing that song with a very short rendition of the song Circle 'Round for Freedom.

During the evening, six different choral groups will be doing 3 songs each, Pete Seeger will be performing, and at the end all the groups will come together to sing the finale (see the first paragraph).

Since I also have a gig in which I'm one of two acts next Sat (which I will post something about very very soon), I'm hoping that this big concert tomorrow will help me to draw a substantially bigger audience.  (I may put flyers on all the seats in the auditorium.)  

For anyone in the area who may feel like coming to this concert tonight that I've just been bragging about, it will be at 
Brooklyn High School for the Arts
345 Dean Street, between 3rd and 4th Avenues
Brooklyn, NY
Tickets $20

As big a deal as this is for me, though, it is much more important for me to bring people in for the gig next week since it will be, after all, _my_ gig as opposed to being one in which I am participating.  I promise, details will follow."

There has been so much going on in my life, personally and (at least lately) professionally, very good and truly horrible that has kept me from taking the time to be here.  It is also partially because of all of that that I am wanting to so much.

My intentions:  For the very short term (like the next 10 days), I plan to use LJ primarily to let friends (and anyone else who choses to read what I write) know about what's going on professionally and plug upcoming stuff).  After that, I'm hoping (and I invite you to push me on this) also share about what has been going on for me and also my family on a personal level over the last couple of years.  

I'm feeling such a strong need to do that in the face of some of the isolation patterns that i've been running (I know it may not look that way from the outside, but it's pretty intense) and it is very challenging for me to do so.  And NOT JUST because of time."

"event","After paying for domain names for a couple of years, I finally got a rudimentary website up earlier this month.  Much will be added as time goes by but I'm excited by what's there so far and would love to know what you all think.  (I've already gotten what I think is some really good advise from yesthattom which I haven't had a chance to implement yet.)

"event","From a speech that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered at the 11th Convention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta, GA on August 16, 1967:

""And I say to you today, that if our nation can spend thirty-five billion dollars a year to fight an unjust, evil war in Vietnam, and twenty billion dollars to put a man on the moon, it can spend billions of dollars to put God's children on their own two feet right here on earth."""

"event","So A and I hired this guy to come over and do problem solving on our computers.  Mine is an HP Pavilion from 1996 that has a 1.53gig hard drive.  Now I know that I need a new computer anyway, but I figured that while I sorting out what I should buy, it would be good to add another hard drive to this one so I can download email without spending more time going through this thing to figure out what I can delete to clear space every time.

Now the hard drive is installed and not really doing what it's supposed to do.  The bigger problem is that after he added this thing and moved stuff around to try to created some additional USABLE space on this computer (which hasn't really been accomplished), my Outlook Express seems to have an empty address book!!!

I've looked on the new D drive with no luck.  The guy said that he has a couple of ideas where it might be but it has been difficult to find a time for him to come back that works for everyone.  In the meantime, I don't have the damned address book and have been feeling quite panicked about the possibility that it might not be retrievable.  Especially since my email MAILING LISTS for PERFORMANCE ANNOUNCEMENTS are on it and I don't have them backed up anywhere!"

"event","There are a number of things I would like to post here, some updates on my life and one or two things I've seen that I'd want to paste in.  I'm feeling a little weird about doing so, however, because it's the first time I've gotten on to LJ in a couple of weeks and I haven't had a chance to read anyone else's entries for quite a while.  

Am I being silly or is there something to the idea that it it's unfair to ask other people to read my stuff when I haven't been able to take the time to read theirs recently?"

"event","After some resistance, I finally went ahead and registered for this Live Journal thing sometime last week.  I don't expect to post much, or even read most of what comes my way (especially if these last few days are a fair reflection of what kind of volume to expect).  None the less, here I am!  It sort of amazes me that minutes after I put a couple of folks on my friends list, I saw that they had put me on their own.  How do people know so fast?  (I know, they check their personal settings.)

I expect that it will take me a while to get a sense of all the ins and outs of LJ; I spent a little time checking out the FAQ and much more time (more time than I can really afford, really) navigating through the site and every time I go to the page of one of my friends, I find more friends and other people that I like out here that I imagine I will gradually add to my friends list."

<lj-cut text=""She is my better half"">

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Have you ever had too
many things gone on in your mind at once and you cannot focus on what you are
doing? That's the path that this is going at, but I'm not really in the mood to
care what is said. At the current time I am listening to Horse the Band because
I enjoy listening to them, with their sexy breakdowns. Lately I've been
listening to random things or Miles Davis. The smooth beats of jazz, its
romantic melody, and its mellow tone just gets me to relax. Music is a
beautiful thing and I've come to fall in to some emotionally, and I'm not to
sure how. An example of this was when I was watching ""Life of the
Aquatic"" and the scene at the end came up with the song
""Staralfur"" in the background. The scene made me cry, I just became
so emotionally involved for some reason.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any who the last
time I updated this was when school started and much has changed since then.
School is hard because I'm doing my work and I truly believe it will be the
death of me. While trying to complete my homework and juggle work hours at the
same time, I believe that I'll pull through some how whether on top or on the
bottom I shall over com'ith. A majority of the time I'm skeptical what's going
on around me because I don't seem to always give it my best, but I believe
it'll go fine. I just try to have fun and that's what I am doing.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I'm still
currently in the relationship I've been in for the past 7 months and 10 days
for. We went shopping today and I got a lot of cute and soft clothes, sadly I
do not know how to shop cheap. At the current time I am trying to figure out
what I'm getting her for Christmas, I have good ideas but you can never over
buy things for the lady. It's early but I like to plan ahead and such. But
today I noticed something, I noticed something I could never really imagine, that
I'm madly in love with a beautiful girl that stole my heart away. I believe
that strikes me every once and a while, it's just so shocking and makes me ever
so happy. I would never imagine that I would ever be in a relationship for so
long, or that I would be so truly happy and in love with this girl. I presume I
shouldn't rant, but I just really love her. To me she is like a drug that I
became dependent on and I become high off of her just by the grace of her, her
presence captures me and makes me giddy like a 5 year old. I sound like a young
kid who is in love for the first time, but that's exactly what I am.<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lately in life
I've come to find a new life that I dwell in. I am a Christian now and such.
The whole church scene and such is how I roll.<span style="""">&nbsp;
</span>The main topic at hand is that lately I was confused at life at the
moment. The path that I was starting to turn down, the path of thought was
making my mind become troublesome. This unsure journey is something I strive
for day by day lately, but for something I've never seen down this road and it
seems to have no end. The feeling of confusion is something I do not like to
dabble in, but when it hits it sticks like a sort of glue that irritates me.
These feelings are triggered by what is going on with my family for there is
nothing I can do about it but just continue to witness what is going on. The
confusion is struck from that because I want to aid them but I cannot do any
effort at all. It seems that I abandon them in a time of need, and all I can
seem to do is doubt I at the moment. Faith in religion has come to a mean of a
way out. In a way it turns the dark and troublesome road to become full of
light. My eyes come to see what has never been and my heart wants to only know its
all clear now. As I write I begin to wonder if it is all becoming so clear to
my simple mind, and if my fall is a product of my impatience for what I cannot
help, for time has to take its course and I just have to do what I can. My
efforts will be in silence and I will come to conquer what makes my mind grow
dull. I presume this is a sort of test in a way, a test for the truth and of me.
My faith is solid and I gain God's glory. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So there you have
it, my new update. I've been hounded by someone to do this and now I've come
around to it. I hope you enjoyed and come back again for another run next
month. Until then, see you space cowboy.<o:p></o:p></p>

I went out to dinner with Sammie girl and some of her little friends. It was fun, good people. Food sucked. Soon I'm going to go see Transporter 2 by myself because I want to see the movie, I like Jason Statham. I believe it's his ruggish look or better perona of being a bond figure in the modern age. When is Jude Law coming out with a new movie?"

I miss my friends, I miss having a life, I just miss being myself. I didn't really think about it much but I haven't really had a summer, work takes up the amount of time pretty much. The key part of why this hit me is because I spent all of my Monday doing all of my ap composistion work and that was GAYYYYY. Procrastination isn't the best method in life, well thats my fault, but i mean damn. 

Anyway if you'd like to see a movie, go shopping, just anything in general please tell me.

d)failing at everything
e)being alone when i get older
f)taking everything I have for granted.
g)losing kim(that's twice but stfu)

I really don't know what is the 100% of this. I was having fun tonight then my mind just slipped to think all of that. I don't know. I keep telling myself it's all gonna be fine, but what if...

"event","It's been a while since I've had my little heart to heart with this journal, so I figured why not try to do so before I goto work. In recent news I have to start my work for school. I think giving homework over summer is a flatout sin and as well the teacher should be stabbed in the eyes for the fact of taking away my freedom. It's shocking to say, but in a month school shall respawn and life will become busy yet again. I'm not sure if I should rejoice or be frightened, for a little bit of me wants to go and then the other part just wants to be done with school all over. Over so I can have a job with crazy hours and to have a wife(the canidate for that job has been chosen already).

What have I been doing lately? Well as of lately I've been hanging out with Kim(that's a given) and doing random things around the house. I find bliss and relaxation in walking to Wawa in the late hours of the night. In current events of my life Kim and I have reached the 5 month mark(and I love her very much!!), I can drive by myself with no strings, I have sunburn, and I got a videogame called Makai Kingdom. Most of this or none of this will appeal to you but oh well. My life is going great and I'm very happy with it.

While waking up this mourning the light shined in my face and I started to remember I had a dream last night. From being in the bright morning I started to recolect upon my courage. Part of my body wants to keep the fight alive but it sometimes falls weak without excuses for my actions aren't at that well thought out. In reality consequence can come like raining fire, burning every part of me. And that's where I need my courage to shine, for me not to be afraid of simle things. To take a chance with things. Lately I have been and I've been free of torment from the past. In my dream it was just me sitting in a room thinking. Thinking of showing no mercy for a day that i thought would never come. A day full of solitude and my lonesome self left to think. So there I laid, a victim of my own decisions. The decisions I wasn't to sure of and I started to question if my faith would be able to pull me up from my own disbelieve. After all of the weird thinking I finally came to wake up and I've came to exchange the wisdom of God for selfish pride. I got up and then I started to wonder why I would do such a thing. Thus my down fall. My appreciation wasn't showed to well and became laced within apologies for forgiveness. Apologies that were build off of something I wasnt to sure of. In my room was a neon sign that flashed ""Grace"", and I can only wonder why this word was there. What is the structure of the word? Why does it capture me? Is grace enough? Grace is where I rest my head to think, it's where the angels sit. I left my room and followed a light that brought me to a ledge. An angel stood with the blinding sun of consequence shining it's light on me. Consequences went through my mind as her silver wings spread to shade my body from the light. From the light there is no where to run but to your arms in all my shame. Reconciled as I weather the storm, I fall to the ground and look to the sky. And this is the end of the dream when I really woke up. I'll never understand the grace bestowed upon me. What does all of this dream mean? I don't know, but I've got a good idea. Shall I tell? Nope.

I don't have anything else to say. At the current time I am thinking about what book to read, when to workout, and how much I love Kim. I don't know if me stating I love her to be cute or annoying, but I do ever so much. I hope you enjoyed reading my little chapter of my day."

"event","Lately I've been confused and put into a trance. My mind asks itself the same thing everyday with no conclusion. When do questions stop having answers? The door closes with the truth slowly behind it. It seems that some are always learning about things, but never come to capture or truely know the truth. In a majority of people they refuse to hear a resonable answer to which they will not except. Humbly I extend the hope I have received careful not to pass judgement or impose my beliefs. But as of lately I can no long apologize for what I hold most dear and with humility I attempt to live with my life with a sincerity that can bridge gaps I have left for quite some time. As of today I finally answer my question and know that by abstaining from things of this world, I am not condeming you but I'm choosing as you choose. To follow what I know to be true, and the truth is the only answer.

Today is now July and it's a Friday. I have to better myself, for I've been slacking off in the school work and getting in shape for any random reason. Today I have work at 12 and I feel someone will try to ask me if I could work all day today or all day tomorrow. My reply? No. Work is easy but truely boring. I wish there was more of a challenge or something. Something of the sorts of having to throwdown with some monster or something the moment we became dead. It's so small and blarg. :/

This is pretty much a pointless post, I don't know wtf I'm trying to say. Just don't run away from your own voice and be left in silence. Hold up yourself nucca'"

A young teacher inspires her class of at-risk students to learn tolerance, apply themselves, and pursue education beyond high school. Totally AMAZING movie... A+++"

cjr

some times I just want to escape
from the spinning that never slows down
and the dizziness I constantly feel

most times I feel like I can't stop
I can't let go of what I feel inside
all the afflicting thoughts in my head

sometimes I just want to break free
of this trapped life I""m living in
away from this claustrophobic life

most times I find myself to lost
far beyond the reach of help
further then anyone can comprehend

some times I feel like I can't go on
like I'm not worth the trouble
and no one can relate"

cynthia jean

I wanted to tell you
I couldn't find the words
can't figure them out

I try to tell myself
there's nothing wrong
not understanding myself

a room with no exit
no way to excape
trapped with myself

self abhorrence
inflicting it's self upon me
never going away

the feeling of lonleiness
never leaving
nearly breaking my heart

the cold all around
the dark shadows
that haunt me

not looking back
not giving in
to the real me

"event","trapped within
Cynthia Jean

she hides herself from the truth,
from the awkward reality
and surrenders herself

the pain is deep within
like a thorn in ones foot
she can't let it out

trapped with no way out
she can't find her way
she slowly gives in

the tears help her to heal
from all that is wrong
from all that will be

feeling emptier then yesterday
like less of a person
she holds out her hands
=======================
I""m trying something new... trying to release my inner pain in a different way then I usually do... if you know me really well you know how that is... the art apparently just scares everyone... so I""m trying poetry... I know I""m not that great at it... but I""m TRYING here... it's either this... or that thing we don't talk about, that I do... basically the emotion from this came from the photo manipulation I made maybe 2 years ago... I've been trying to find words to go with it so these were inspired from that picture... however it's not quite what I want to go with it, but does convey an emotion I was looking for."

we drew a name to find out who we were getting a present for..so I decided we would draw a name to open them as well...so I drew the first name to start things... and I handed the gift from under the tree to that person, and once they opened their gift they had to guess who bought their gift, or say I give up.. LOL then they got to draw a name from the hat...and that person would open the gift..and so on and so on.. LOLOL

"event","Ok...I was board and thought I'd share my useless everyday ponderings... maybe you ponder the same things...

1. Does anyone else run out of conditoner before shampoo?? why dont they sell less shampoo and more condishoner... ppffff
2. the age old topic of ""why are there to many hot dog buns and not enough hotdogs? not only that but for us veggies..the hotdogs dont even fill out the whole bun... there's a whole bite on both ends of just bun...
3. Did you know it's impossible to lick your elbow? I can safely say it is impossible... I""ve tried...
4. Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour...yeah...those migrains I get... I think we've discovered the root of the problem...
5. You find the perfect person for you but they dont realize it until you give up on them 2 years later and lost intrest...Bad timing...anyone else suffer? And it's not just in the past, it's present and future instances as well...
6. Every time you lick a stamp, you're consuming 1/10 of a calorie... but how many do you burn licking it in the first place...
7. Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than left-handed people do.But what does this mean for the ambidextrous person? a half life? you live longer then the leftie but shorter then a rightie? =( I'm doomed... or is it totally backwards.. you just live even LONGER then the rightie for using both......
8. The only 15 letter word that can be spelled without repeating a letter is uncopyrightable. lol so does that mean I can steal the word? it's uncopyrightable.... they can't copyright it...
9. Nutmeg is extremely poisonous if injected intravenously. anyone wanna try? just to make sure it's true?? I""m licensed to access your veins... =)
10. Every 5 seconds a computer gets infected with a virus... I think I should switch back over to my apple... I'm a lot less likely to get one there! ha

any comments or questions..feel free to reply here.. or contact me via phone, e-mail, finding me in person... =) hehe well..this concludes Cindy's useless facts of everyday life part 1"

I made them 2 days after getting back from Camp meeting... we call our group ""tabouli""... why...we have no clue...but we just do... and we are all reallyyy close... we can hang out with any of the 15 of us and have an awesome time... we can hang out all together and still have a great time... lately we've bee playing ""in house"" pranks... another words... pranks on other taboulians... 4 of us just made an alliance and we are the top 4 pranksters...and with all 4 of us on the same team... the possibilities are ENDLESS... LOL hahahhaaa ok I know I haven't had a chance to message a lot of you in the past... here's an update.. =) and pictures... which are loads of fun.. .this is only like 1% of the pictures we have in Tabouli... I""m working on making the tabouli year book... and ""the complete history of tabouli"" which I expect to be published... well.. who knows when... but it should be published when I""m done with it!! LOL

the first one is me and ALL my new friends from ""Tabouli""... our group.. hehe and a few extra... that was September 9... the day Michael and I had our birthday party... =) so we were stuffed with pizza and cake and then tried to cram 17 people into bushes... here's everyone's name starting from Left... (left down) David Twin,(left up against wall) Rob, Tim, Aaron, David Hat(watso), Cindy (me), Derek *whom I shall kill for putting bunny ears on me...*, Rolland, Michael, Kayla, Ashley, Keith, (hidden behind keith) Jeff, Adriel (the blond streak in the picture)... there were about 4 others playing but they got tired and ditched us.. LOL but that is my core group... minus the 4 that ditched... LOL we were missing Kenny, Xander (David's twin), Shawn, Andrew, and Hugo who has departed for ""home"" since he graduated last year.. hahaa

Boomer sitting in the grasses with his sweater...and his leash.. =) he's a happy fu  oh for those who dont know... Mr. Fu is just a nickname... his name is Boomer, sometimes we call him Sir. Boomington... Mr. fu... foofie... Boom... whatever else... he sits in the grass with us every friday afternoon... saturday afternoon, and random other days we sit in the grass... =) I've had boomer for 3 years and 3 months now.. =)

me doing homework in the grass...with Ashley... and others but they arent in the shot... mr. fu was there too..

Eating food at some random peoples house... they told Tim to invite his friends over for games one Saturday night like...before school started... and he said he had 15 friends...and they said that's fine... so we all went... LOL that's xander (short for alexander..which he hates... and that's his middilish name... it's Ericalexander (all run together... their dad wanted a girl...and to name her Erica... so he got his way by naming poor xander Ericalexander... and his twin brother David is shown in the next picture... the guy behind xander (dude with a lot of hair... is another David..we call him either Watso since his last name is Watso... or David Hat... becasue he loves to wear hats...

me dissecting Adriel's teddy bear... this was the day we went to atlanta to see the bodies exhibit... hehe

The giant birthday card I made for David Hat (watso)'s birthday... and we were at my place... 16 of us... and we had pasta night...and then birthday cake which I made... hehe it was 3 layers of chocolate cake with chocolate frosting...and white iceing that said ""we lost"" due to a game we are playing... and still playing.... I just lost for saying all that...blah... and then decorations included a rubber rat...  and the guy signing the card I made for everyone to sign (which was just a giant piece of illustration board...) is Chris Hammer... his brother Justin is in a lot of my art classes...they look like twins... they are also paper thin and over 6'4... Justin is 6.6'.. we loose him in the movies all the time... the movie will get out and we'll all be walking out and he'll turn sideways and be standing right in front of us and we can't see him because he's so paper thin...

me pretending to smoke incense... the mozzies were biting us so we got our my incense and stuck a ton in the grass and lit them... and we would hold a few ourselves to keep the smoke amongst us to keep the mozzies away... it made for a lot of jokes... boom was in the grass and frolicked over to an incense and sniffed it...ended up snuffing it out... he sniffed to close and I think he felt the warmth to closely and snuffed it with his upper lip..and bounced away like someone was about to eat him... guess he learnt his lesson on curiosity...

Chris... pretending to smoke 2 incenses... we thought this pic would wokr good in national geographic... LOL who knows.. lol maybe it can...

Michael and me pretending to blow out invisible candles on our cake.... we imagined they were there..and everyone imagined we blew them out...

Michael and me cutting up our cake... LOL that cake was 90% gone before we left... lol it was really good... Jeff bought us a chocolate and vanilla marble cake... and our names were on the top ""happy birthday Michael & Cindy""... that was a fun night.. =) boomer thought so too...

Kindove a blurry picture but this is most of the group we had for our birthday party... we had a short vespers at the end of our eating and cakeing...and 4 people's water fight... thankfully I didn't get involved in that one... it was coldish that night... no time to change and play sarcdeans if you got wet.. hehe

well now that you have endured the endless torture of my slide show via e-mail... LOL... thank you for keeping your head and hands inside the tour bus... you may exit in an orderly fashion... or just hit the reply button...and say hi... or message me online.. .since I""m always online...but these days I""m only actually behind my computer like... past 11pm (when all my friends are locked in the dorm)..and random other times.. LOL I""m studying to much these days... you can't catch me... feel free to add me none the less...

Great Companion
""It's not that you've lost a friend,
I just need some time to lick my wounds
I'll be out of service for a little while
I""m sure I""ll be back up and running soon
He's just amateur these days
Not use to dealing with this pain
He's just an am amateur these days
Never through he'd see it go away

And our history will never be erased
You were a great companion
And some memories will never, ever faid
And so I love and so I hate

What we were I never knew, nor did you
And that's exactaly what you hated
For theree years you were confused
And for three years my intentions left unstated

And our history can never be erased
You were a great companion
And some memories will never, ever fade
And so I love and so I hate

So this is the end of an innocent era, an innocent error
I didn't want you but I di, it's never over but it is

Our history can never be erased
You were a great companion
And some memories will never fade away
You were a great companion

Our history can never be erased
You were a great companion
And some memories will never ever, ever, fade""

"event","so I have this friend... Morgan Wade... we went to PUC together... I've known him since my freshmen year at PUC...2001... but then in 2002..he didn't talk to me for a YEAR.... he got mad at me for getting on his case for eating to much sugar.. he had a cookie, pudding, soda, chocolate milk, and a piece of cake in one meal.... the boy is diabetic.... I didn't want him to die... and he got mad... so he didn't talk to me for a year... well time passes...by the time my ex broke up wtih me we were talkign again because I remember talking to him about Chris breaking up wtih me and this girl he was sssooOOooo in love with broke up wtih him.... so we were both kinda greiving together... I really remember that...  so since then we've kinda been friends... just talking online here and there... probably about as much as we do.. =) lol but then last 3 or 4 motnhs we've been chatting online... and knew we'd see eachother at camp meeting...

so I foudn him the day before it started he recruited me to help him teach primary, so I did... we were hanging out together 24/7 all week..10 days  in the middle of nowhere.. all my friends have camp meeting friends and I was psycked to have one of my own... my ageish.. (he's 25)... everyone else i know is 21 and under... mostly 15... peoplke started thinking we were together.. he took me out for coffee, he paid.. he took me to his house... to his stupid comunity meeting... he took me out to another place and he paid.... we went to coffee again...he paid.... he took me to the board walk (for camp meeting that's the #1 date option) we were bumping sholders all week, he was hugging me better then chris ..conversation hugs.. he would hug me for minutes at a time for no reason and we'd talk and I started to like him
 and days keep going by

 I was with him so much... and everyone was all.. ssooOoooo..where've yyooUUuuuu been  and others were sayign ""awhh you guys are such a cute couple"" which we acutally were...his mom loved me to death she took us out somewhere nice..the 3 of us  she's so sweet, he's a freak
 I feel like were dating without dating  we did more then chris and I did.. minus the hand holding...lol all that bumping sholders

 sitting next to eachother sholder to sholder.......   ok..get this @ church saturday... last day of camp meeting this lady asked me if my HUSBAND was coming back to sit next to me <galre> I actually was like.. yeah he's coming back  we looked like we belonged together  I liekd taking care of him he got really sick one day  he dind't look good and was in the middle of teaching the kids..and he didn't look good...he had to sit down.. I got him water.. made him drink it.. it helped *he's diabetic..once again...lol since he was 9... and I could tell his sugar was high... so I did everything I could to make him better until he could try to make his incolin pump work again... to bad that wasn't going to help in the end... it was messed up and he wasn't ngetting any... it was bent at the end..**
he had to leave to check his blood  I had to improve teaching  which was bad... LOL I didnt' knwo what I wa sdoing so I had to improve somethin to tell these kids for 10 minutes.. LOL we talked about the sand..at the beach.. and how it's formed... lol *he's a teacher.. graduated from PUC last year... I""m art education major.. helped his mom a few times teaching arts and crafts to the primary kids...*

so anyways...  he came back and his blood sugar was 590
 wasn't going down  after teaching we went to his truck
 took out his old pump.. it was BENT  I got to watch him put in a new one he didnt really want me to watch  but I wanted to... I'm a phlebotomist.. it doesn't bug me and I want'ed to know how to help him if he was passed out...
 he was wining all week how he needs to marry a nurse to take care of him.. pfff I was like.. uhh.. morgan.. you dont need to marry a nurse.. anyone can be taught...  he was like. you know. .your right.. your so smart.. I""m like ... gee thanks...   and then I was watching him put in his incolin pump  anyways.. I watched and he was like... this is kinda graphic, you might not wanna watch.. I was like.. uh.. morgan.. I""m a freaking phlebotomist...  he's like... no you arent!!... I'm like.. uuhh YEAHHH I am... I have a california state license...... he was shocked...... so the old pump that was in was bent... wasn't giving him any incolin... new one went in okish... but it still wasn't falling.. so I had to walk him back to the tent and find him a neadle to manually insert the incolin in his stomac...... which was equally intersting...... ok now that I soudn like a morbid freak.... lol neadles dont bug me.. LOL anyways.. back to my story.. it gets worse...

so saturday... after that lady asked if my husband was comign back...  he had to do his thing on stage he was singing in the qartet thing  and he had just gone on and on about this coffee blind date he had later ""this"" week  and I was like HELLOOO DO YOU NOT SEE ME
 we were sitting sholder to sholder and we didn't have to
 he could of sat anywehre  and yet he had to be touching my sholder at all times which was nice... my ex didn't even do that... ppfff but if I had known it was all platonic all that time I woudn't of cared, I woudln't of fallen fo rhim
 so yeah... he was singing  I wrote a note.. something along the lines of ... morgan.. I dont understand how you cant see that I like you.. I dont want to be your sister.. blah blah blah blah blah  he refered to me as his sis
 the sis he never had ... our personalities are IDENTICAL well..99%... his mom was like ""oh my gosh.. you are the female verson of him""  

our jokes were so funny.. we were on the same brain wave for everything..with acceptions of his add..where he jumps conversations to often  but we were cracking southpark jokes all week bbuutt mmuuu mmmMmmmmmmmmmm  I hated that he asked his mom for $$ all the time.. and then go spend it on me... he's freaking 25 and he was ordering her aroudn to make him food....  his mom and I were like so close  she would give me her cell to call him (mien was dead)  and so I'd go off to where you get service  leave her int he tent  I reeeeally hope you don't end up with him  and I call him forever... he told me to ask ""mom"" to make him a sandwich   I told him... she's not goint to make you a sandwich but I""ll ask

 he finally arives.. his mom and I are passed out reading books in the tent waiting for him
 I had fun with her and him.... I was so happy all week
 I hadn't been so happy in 4 years  I felt needed

 I gave him note saturday....  last time I saw him he was reading it... we were suposto drive to PUC together saturday... I gave him note saturday morning... I left notes on his car... he never came to find me. .or leave a note.. he just LEFT... and he didn't go to PUC... he decided not to go.. probably because of me... uugggg so anyways...

 he would hug me and then have a conversation for liek 2 minutes... and he'd put his hands on my sholders and shake me and complain about his bad day with trying to find a job at a local adventist school... or how everything was just oging wrong like the day his pump broke...

so yeah...  he took me to the board walk but we went to the boardwalk... and it was so fun... we walked to the end, shared a GIANT donut... got ice cream... sat in the sand for a while and talked.. he told me I should move to santa cruz( where he lives)  for no reason  I""m like... uh... I was THINKING... why the heck would I move here unless we were thinking about being together??... good thing I didnt' say that.. haa.er.... how can I NOT get the idea he liked me then we keep bumped sholders the whole evening...a guy also working int he primary tent saw us there and gave us that look like heeyyy what's up!! havin a good time?!?!... he didnt' say anything but had that look in his eye...   next morning Morgan calles my cell...and says.. hey.. .I had fun last night... and I was like... yeah.. me too does that NOT SOUND LIEK A DATE RETURN CALL not that I've ever a) been on a real date b) had a date return call (I just watch a lot of movies...lol)

I got bit by a snake for him... there was aparently a snake in the girls bathroom next to the primary tent were we were teachign some kids... and so he's a pansie..so I went to get it.. I scooped it up into a box.. (just a little garder snake.. black with a yellow stripe..size of a straw.. little guy... so I bring it back to the primary tent because morgan wanted to show the kids... so I do... and they were sticking their hands in the box and their heads..and we were freaking out..so morgan said to pick it up.. so I did... everything was fine until this kid was SQUEEZING ITS MIDDLE... and it got mad and BIT ME.......... ger... and I was like... uhhhh MORGANNN... problem!!!!!!! he freaked out.. LOL litterly... he just lost it.. lol he was like I dont evne know if that's poisonus!! I'm liek.. dude... it's not... no triangular head... lol chill... so anyways...

 I got trampled by a goat for him the next day.. we broguht a baby goat in for the kids to pet, and play with... and learn more about farm animals... and to not feed pets that aren't yours without asking the owner... very important... someone was feeding this little goats brother...straw...and it DIED on the way to the vet... straw is bedding.. not food... ppffssshhh... but anyways... that thing was going to the bathroom everryywhereee I had to clean up after it every 5 minutes..and it was walking all over me.. jumping up on all the benches... and trying to eat my clothing... ger.. and he had a great time pointing that out ot the kids... (what do goats eat??... other then Cindy's clothing...)

 I get home to PUC... where olivers live aimee had to hug me while I was crying last night @ camp meeting  aimee and her cousin becca.. because they thought we were cute...and that our personalities matched... and they coudl so see us together...  everyone thought we were already together and when I 'disapeared all day"" and we were out getting ""coffee"" we wer eon dates ppfff  so anyways  I didn't go there liking him  I didn't intend to like him  it just HAPPENED he CALLED ME... 10 hours after I gave him teh note that I liked him.. (mean while I had his phone charger since our sare the same charger...and mine was fried not working) and he called... because he drove off without leaving a note that I TOLD HIM TO LEAVE ME ONE.. or call... and he never did until he was home

so he called and said he doesn't like me back, doesn't return those feelings  then continues to tell me what to do.. go to southern... get into my classes... find a guy here
 ugh. I hung up on him cause he was hurting me with pawning me off and stuff and treating me like tha tall week and then not even liking me so I hung up... I get to aimees house..write a LONG message about WHY it was so wrong for him to treat me like that and not tell me it was platonic so I wait and wait  he messages me back but he NEVER READ IT...  he said he is cutting all comunication with me to make sure I am not pining afte rhim  I'm ssoo not pining afte rhim  I'm over him sosoooo over him  it was a crush, he crushed it.. its dead.. and now I have no friend
 he deleeted me as a freind on myspace  wont respond to any calls, or e-mails wont return  or pick up  so anyways... I was really really upset that he didn't want to be friens anymore that just pissed me off.... so anyways.. he wont talk to me... deleted me as a friend... my sis keeps talking to him nthough... daily... I told her to tell him if he's even THINKING about being friends EVER in the future he better start talking to me soon before I refuse to even be an aquointance......."

"event","ok so for the past month and a half since I got my tickets to fly to california for camp meeting I've been excited. I can't wait. It's the only thing I think aobut, talk about... Here it is 3 days before I go and I""m not as excited... I am way glad to get off work for 2 weeks... and GO to camp meeting... but I get the feeling NOW that I""m not wanted. I'm suposto stay with the Olivers *I'm pretty sure none of them check LJ*... so anyways... they invited me, told me whenever I book my flight just tell them the times and they'll send someone to get me.. any time before and after is fine... before they were all excited... now... it seems like they dont really want me to come... and it's making me feel like I shouldn't go and feel unwanted. I still want to go just to see some friends that said they would be there... I called aimee to chat and conferm and she put me on speaker phone...and I could bairly hear her, and everyone else was talking...and I coudln't talk to her about details...and her brother said ""so where are you staying""... as if... so your staying somewhere other then with us... I thought I was staying with them.. It hought that's what happened when they invited me... but I hate it when aimee's brothers say that... ""so where are you staying""... well.. I THOUGHT I was staying at your house.... so why are they asking?... well aimee isn't asking, aimee always asumed I was staying with them also... I just dont understand what is going on... or why James is so mis-informed.... but he seems to make me always feel unwanted... so I called there Mom to doubble check to see if they were going to pick me up... she seemed to have forgotten the day I was coming... it was fun talking to her... until I had to bring up the whole flying in dates... and then she mentoned she might have me take the ""evans"" to napa... so am I paying or are they? I""m confused... and she also said if not that then they'll come get me and take a load of things to camp meeting and leave me there.......... oh yeah... alone in a tent with millions of things... like they really really dont want me... which is fine, I'm nobody... I""m lucky they invited me int he first place..maybe to be polite and they though tI woudln't actually come.... I am just really wanting a hug right now... =( someone hug me... ok not really... I only like to be hugged by select people... I have a bubble space... if you invaid my bubble that's not good... but anyways... this is my venting typing... I""ll reply to it if anything changes... blah... when I come back from camp meeting I might get to re-update it... and inform any new developments... oh yeah and I also am falling OUT of love with my crush... how odd...everything is falling apart.. something must be wrongw ith me.. I feel unwanted..and unloved... I want HIM to call me... and text ME first... I""m tired of being the first.. if he likes me enough he SHOULD text and call me... so if I ""disapear"" for a while... maybe he'll just asume I can't... and not bother... =(  but I really want him to text and call.. =( uugggg ok so anyways... that's my life story for today... sorry I haven't bloged in a while... ok since last week but before that.. =( I really need to do it more often... helps with my venting.. uugggg"

They toched beaks and then flew off corigraphically... it made me think, maybe when you find the perfect mate, the person you want to live iwth the rest of your life, nothing else maters. When finding someone you want to marry you look for someone you want to share a house with, share family with... not just someone you think looks good... this is going ot be the person you come home to after work, say a few words to and share a bed... when it gets down to it, that's about as much you'll get to see of eachother... maybe hollidays, weekends, vacations... but look for someone you can spend that little bit of time with, forever. Some get lucky and dont work as much as others, or get to work at home, or lucky mothers who can stay home with the kids... I look forward to a day when I get to do all those things... Get married, have kids, own a house, go on vacation with my family..."

I'm sick of watching her make out and kiss and hug everyone... especally roger... I need someone I can talk to and vent aobut all this... I need a friend to talk to... someone who wi9ll really listen to me... maybe give me some advice... I'm sure things would be better if I had a b/f of my own... I'm to faithful, I can't have more then one b/f at a time... that's just crazy... I'm just incapable of flirting... I feel stupid... I keep confronting roger about all this but tonight he really took the iceing off the cake... A) he didn't give me a lift to class (our class' are in the same building at the same time... it's on his way... b) he wouldn't answer his cell when I called c) he dyssed my cooking and then when he tried it was shocked that it was good.... waht the heck... I'm not a bad cook... I'm not my room mate... d) he's all over my room mate and just tell's everyone they are friends, and yet he was over here all alone with her while she was ""sick"" and told me that nobody was comign to pick me up after class... it was dark and late... so I told him he had to come get me... so he makes me walk to the market... instead of getting me infront of the building... what the heck... so I was just chatting with him... confronting him again about his ""jen"" relationship...and I was typing something else to rebuttle...and he said ""what do you care, it's not your life""... I stated that I was sick and tired of them being all over eachother.. I'm nto stupid, I can see it... all the back rubs, and the sexual flirting, and sharing the bed... whatever..."

"event","ok so there is this guy... and he's been stalkign me, or so it would seam. I met him 4 days ago, and here I am going to a movie with him. I count this as a ""date"" even though I don't intend to do anything ""alone"" with him ever again. I'm lucky my room mate and her friend meet up with us at the theater to watch ""Prime"". I know for a fact I don't want to date him. I'm ok with beign friends, but that depends on how far you have to go to help somebody with who they are. He has a lot of issues, and needs all the help he can get. He wanted to stop for a beer 8 times between picking me up and dropping me off at the dorm. Luckily we made it to the movie and back without him having any. I'd have to say since this is the first time I've dated since my big break-up with chris, I'm glad to be out of my dateless phase. I just need to find someone to date that actually has morals and a plan for their life. I""m at a point in life where I am looking for someone to date long-term. Over the past few years I've discovered more about the type of person I am looking for. I refuse to go out or allow somebody to get the idea that they have a chance if we have nothing in common. If I dont feel there is a chance, I wont allow anything to happen. I let my guard down tonight for the first time, glad I did, but I know that I dont want to date him. He needs to be on his anti psycotics still. Needs to give up his beer's. Good greif this boy needs help. I'm not so sure anymore that I can give him that help. I dont know how much a friendship can take, especally with someone who can't go an hour without thinking about drinking. I dont know if it's just me who feel's this way. Of course I'm whith-holding some information... If you really want tno pick a conversation with me and know more details then IM me... but I would like to know what you think about all this... give me some advice...

I make 5 bucks when I get someone else to join too (so the company grows) this is what happened with paypal at first.. I remember I got cash for joining paypal back in the day, AND paypal sent me a $1 coin... but that was then..now I get 25 for ME to join, and $5 every tiem a friend joins (they get their 25 also) even if you dont end up keeping the acount you get free $$ you dont have to buy anything to get yoru money. So far I haven't had to put a credit card on there either.. there are a number of ways to put money on the acount, and you can use it on ebay like paypal.

if you have any questions feel free to ask me... for now this is the only way I can make money.. if I make up to 100 Bucks doing this I'll upgrade to the gold acount so I make money faster..ha yeah right..blah dare to dream I make that much $$ quickly... the sooner you just sign up, the more likely you'll make money... what if you wait 5 months to sign up, you know your going to sign up eventuall... you might as well get the money NOW for signing up before it isn't free (like paypal now)..."

poor little hammy was lost in my room..I didn't worry about it to
much... I figured he'd come out when it was dark and quiet.. like at
2am... lol or if he got hungry or thirsty..so I put his cage on the
floor... I ended up going to bed at like 3:20..bad idea... I missed
church.. <sigh>..

"event","we've known Radius my pet rat, has had a tumer on her stomac since July. I didn't expect her to live past thanksgiving, and then christmas, and then valentines day... Here it is March 20 and she's still alive... well tonight she waddled out from under my bed and she smelt really really really bad.. my rat usually smells ok becuase I give her a bath every 2 weeks.. my rat has always been sweet, and loving and poty trained and everything about her is just amazing... well since the tumer has gotten so big she's been confined to living in some cloth under my bed.. she rumples the cloth up and sleeps under it, and in it and everything. 

Well as she waddled out tonight I wanted to check on her tumer and to see how badly infected that area was under her. I looked and the infected area has SPLIT OPEN and is now about 3 inches LONG and I can see at least an inch into her stomac.. it's very very very nasty. I feel so bad for my ratty. I can't take it anymore, she needs to be put to sleeep. She is a great pet rat. but I dont want her to suffer anymore. I was hoping she could just die in peace, but this is to much.. .it's to terrible now.. This week is really going to be hard on me. Monday I have to do phlebotomy in hemet.. A) I hate driving to hemet B) I get nervous being a student drawing blood off of these elderly people C) the peole that work there aren't so friendly towards me D) my rat is GOING to die this week... I can't let her go on like this...
 
I just got my mom to show radius to her, and she said it's probably time. we both cried about past pets we have put down. I was holding my last rabbit when she died. The feeling of feeling that pet's heart beat stop forever never leaves your memory. I haev flashbacks sometimes. I can't keep it in, I can't stop crying. I connect to animals better then humans sometimes. 

but the point of this blog is that I'm going to have a very rough week. I dont know how i""ll make it. Parents telling me to join the navy, rat being put down, having to go to hemet to finish up my phlebotomy... that alone is tramatic for me.. but having to put my rat down is going to make me burst into tears in the middle of working."

"event","ok so here's how it is... my dad and sister are tring to MAKE me join the US Navy.. I dont want to enlist or bein the navy at all... they say ""they will pay for my student loans, and educate me, and pay me through it all, and I'll be in better shape, and make friends, and I'll be aloud to have my rabbit with me after a while""... they also said they had a career in dolphin training... but they dont.. ... they are just trying ot get me to sign up.. I dont know why, I dont want to join.. I'm 90% against this...

I dont really do to much at home, but I'm a cronlically depressed person, I'm trying to get over my depression a little at a time. I finally stopped cutting myself.. I have a lot of issues.. I really really dont like people yelling at me.. or near me.. it pushes me over the edge... I dont do well with running or jogging.. I have asthma.. and when I do sit ups or crunches one of my bottem right ribs pop and it really h urts.. I use to be prety fit.. I had semingly a 6pack when I was in 8th grade... I did 14 years of gymnastics.. I was in pretty good shape.. then when I hurt my wrist about 5 years ago I had to stop gymnastis.. now I""m more into iceskating and yoga... back to the main topic... so my dad is really really really trying ot get me to sign up.. if it was a short amount of time like 2 monts max I woudln't mind but the min amount of time you can spend in the navy is 2 years.. that's SOOO long..

I have other problems... I'm a veggatarian.. and a seventh day adventist (go to church every saturday...)... I dont work from sundown friday to sunset saturday night... no work, games, tv, movies, stuff like that.. my family was really strict with that.. it's a day of rest.. we either go hiking, visit the ocean, or sleep... something like that... ok so I really dont know what to do.. if I join for a whie they will get off my back.. but I dont want to join! I'm passionate about not joining.. I dont want to be any part of an army thing.. I dont like war, or weapons... I dont drink, or do drugs, and I beleive in sex after marrage... I really dont want to put myself in a place where I wont be able to talk to people like me... or worship the way I have. I can't survive without pets...

ok so here's what I'd like you to do..those of you who have read all this so far... pick one of the next numbers and reply to me..with your explanation...

1. STAY AWAY DONT DO IT STAY OUT
2. Try it for a while
3. try reserves
4. go through basic and if I dont like it try to get out??
5. sign up for the full thing no regrets sign up now!

"event","ok so for a while now I have been thinking about and researching ""rabbit castration"" to decide weather or not I want to get my rabbit fixed... He's been getting agressive, and bitting me, spraying me when I'm asleep..ger.., humping my poor cancer ridden rat, and just fistey... he'll scratch and bite for no reason and doesn't want to snuggle all tha tmuch... so I have researched a lot and I think I'm going to go through with getting him fixed... 
Reasons to get boomer fixed...
1) he will stop spraying
2) he wont be as agressive
3) his pea wont smell as strong <and man it is strong, highest strenght kitty litter isn't cuttin it>
4) he'll stop humping the rat <and my fuzzy slippers but I dont mind that..hehe>
5) prevent the chance of cancer in that area
Reasons to not get boomer fixed
1) risk of not waking up from anastetic <slim..but still>
2) wont be able to breed him <and he's such a sexy bunny... dutch with blue eyes>
3)he wont want to dance around me or hump my fuzzy slippers <and for the most part that's hwo I catch him when he is frollicing in our living room when he shouldn't be...>

blah..well I think getting it done is in favor... the younger they are ""after their man hood has decended"" the better chance they will stop spraying, and being agressive... I hope everything goes well and that boomer recovers well and is a happy bunny afterwords.. I've been asking people if they've had a male cat fixed and what the before and after effects were and if they would have done it again to their pet... I think it's time to go through with this... the sooner the better now.. he's almost 9 months old.. and that's pushing it for getting him fixed... 4-6 months is where you want him to be fixed idealiy..so he's a few months over that... I'll post more about how he is feeling tomorrow..."

"event","ok so my dad messaged me and said I had to do one of two things... #1 help put grandma back to bed #2 do some dishes... well I""m sick of doing the dishes I dont make so I picked #1..plus I haven't seen my grandparents in a while... so I was all like, ok boomer and I are ready to go... and they said he couldn't go cuase it's raining... so I put boom back in my room and hammy was sitting in his cage where I can pick him up, and play with him...where his food is... and so I picked him up and put him in my pocket of my long jacket... it was like he wanted to go, he was sitting there waiting to be picked up. Grandma doesn't mind hammy, he's little, cute and fuzzy and has a snub of a tail... so we walked over in the rain, with our umbrella's..and I let hammy crawl on my mom's hand and she was like WHATS THAT... and she thought it was suzie Q (my mouse) but I said..nOOooo it's HAMMY.. little horatio... 
ok so we get to my grandparents house and my mom makes ME do all the work getting her from the wheel chair to her bed.. (she can't do anythign her self, bed ridden, if she's in the wheel chair it stays in one spot and never moves) so we use this lift thing called a hoyer lift... and so she made me do all the hooking up of the chains and lifting her with the thing and moving it to the bed... hard work, grandma weigh's over 270 LB... so anyways... hammy was crawling on my back so mom made me give him to dad.. my dad doesn't like anything other then the dog.. he'll tolorate the rabbit... not for long.. he doesn't pet them or touch them, he'll pat the rabbit on the head and then he'll run away... so I put hammy on dad and he complains like he always does like ""get this THING off me..."" so I go back to helping mom with grandma, or rather her telling me what to do with grandma... and then I put the lift back and dad is looking around my jacket like dduhhh he's gone??... 
so hammy got lost in my grandparents house, their house is like a mold trap... everything is old, and smelly... they dont throw anything out, and food is ont he counters that belongs in the fridge... ants... you name it... so now my poor hamster is lost in the couch, my parents are pissed at me..mostly my dad..even though he woudlnt' keep track of hammy... grandma liked seeing hammy, she doesnt' get ot see anything other then the ceiling and the tv... she's been in the same room for ht epast 2 months... I'd go crazy.. so I walked home in the rain alone crying and praying that somehow we'd find hammy.. grand dad thinks that hammy will come out when he watns to and he's so ""dossil"" that he'll just pick him up and put him in a box... my mom got a box from their gurage... I hope and pray eh comes out... 
when I go thome I got hammy's sleeping area and where he stashes his favorite food off his cage and took it over, and put it under the couch... I think if he wants to he'll smell it and crawl in.. he know's it's his home... I just hope God will help hammy find his way home to me.. I miss him.. please pray for hammy... little horatio"

"event","late at night I tend to like to have a warm cup of hot coco.. last night my dad made my mom and me hot drinks, and he claimed we were out of normal hot coco and offered me some of the expencive mint hot coco.. I wasn't to into this idea but decided to take it since I was cold and thirsty.. it was ok... kinda to minty for my liking... I ended up with 1/2 a cup of cold mint coco, 2 hours later took it up to my room with me to take the last of my med's.. I ended up takin the pill with water and I had this cup of frezing mint coco and boomer was dancing around my legs like always late at night.. so I sat on the floor with him and let him sniff the drink, then he stuck his head in the mug and drank away... aparently the bunny loves mint coco.. he sure is loud when he drinks from a mug..LOL it was funny to sit there and listen to my rabbit drink cold mint coco... LOL"

"event","I have awaited Feb. 1, 2005 for over a month now... The thought of watching yet another season of I love lucy on dvd, being able to watch with no comercials, and enough episodes to last a few hours. Christmas 2003 I asked for I love Lucy compleat season 1... it was amazing to me that it existed, I knew it was on vhs, but I only use dvd's. I was excited with that, and watched my season 1 dvd's after studying, while I studied, and as a time waster between short things... having a short 20 min break is nice, not watching a while dvd and not having to stop in the middle of a show.. Then for christmas 2004 I had realized that I love lucy season 2 had come out in september and I asked for season 2. I wasn't to suprised receiving it for christmas, concidering it has become a patern.. now to break the patern, season 3 comes out TOMORROW.... if my wallet hadn't been stolen I would have pre ordered it ages ago.. but now that I have no money I can't buy the beloved 3rd compleat season of I love lucy.. my only hope is that my parents will give it to me for valentines day.. or I save up enough money to just get it myself.. maybe if I do some work for my dad in exchange for him to buy them.. oh how I long to see what is on that compleat 3rd season... maybe an episode or 2 I haven't seen in ages... <sigh> oohhh I can't wait... I will reply to this message when I finally own season 3..."

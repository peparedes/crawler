"event","for those of you who may actually give a shit about the life of gus, here's a very brief update:

i (along with a trio of my good friends) are moving into a 3 bedroom townhouse in pasadena. free of charge to us. we just pay the utilities and whatnot.

i learned of this last night. i have the key today. i spent over an hour cleaning the nastiness out of the refrigerator. it's a little bit of a mess, but it's free. i imagine i'll be over there within the week.

it's a very nice place. i'll write more later, maybe.

I'd read it to some music and I'd want to make it rhyme.

A million words I'd want to write but it's not what I'll do

So words lie wasted in a pile that was just meant for you.

And if you knew the words that weren't I'd wonder what you'd say

But now is never; words so clever, mute they went this day."

"event","So, here I am at the end of another birthday. I guess technically my birthday ended a couple of hours ago, but who cares.

Yesterday (Sunday) I had a little narnecue/party/get-together under the premise of a birthday party at Jason's place. It's out in the boonies, but it really was a great place for a narnecue. Tons of room outside, a fire pit, decrepit cars, mind-damaged dogs and the presence of great friends who I don't get to see nearly enough. It was missing some of the festivities of narnecues of old, but they'll be back. I was really happy with the way it turned out. There were a couple of people absent who I really would have liked to have seen. Oh well.

Following the party I overslept horribly. I didn't find my way out of bed until about 2:00 in the afternoon. I really didn't want to have anything planned out for my actual birthday so when I was presented with a couple of opportunities I promptly turned them down. After lunch I hopped in the car and drove aimlessly until an urge struck me.

I wound up at GameStop in the Santa Anita mall. I bought two packs of Star Wars Rebel Storm miniatures, one for myself, one that I decided to give to Joe Kou as a birthday gift (even though it was my birthday, not his). I called Joe and headed over to his house to drop it off. He got one of the really rare figures (a biker scout on his speeder bike) and he immediately NEEDED more. He was crazed. I was frightened, but compliant. We hopped into the car and off we went.

<i>(now, if you know anything about Joe, you know that he, as a 22 year old chinese man, has a 6:00 curfew. I don't need to say more than that right now. but, let me just say that for Joe to actually make a conscious decision to break curfew while his mom is at work is a big thing indeed.)</i>

We wound up finding a pair of starter packs at the Montebello mall. The path took us by Ash's house. I flipped it off. Joe clutched his speeder bike.

We got back to Casa de Kou and after a few minutes of trying to decipher the rules to the game, we played twice. I beat him handidly the first game. The second game I totally whupped his ass. I left after the second game so I didn't have to see his Chinese mom.

Next stop Denny's, then a super shitty pool hall. The jukebox sucked. I couldn't help but play Queen and Blondie, though.

Now I'm home. Happy Birthday to me. Who cares."

""just because a dream is unattainable it doesn't take away how beautiful the dream can be""

The last thing that I want is to sound like is that my head is in the clouds and that I am some forlorn poet, but the words fit together nicely.

"event","At 12:36 a.m. I was standing on the westbound 10 freeway staring at cops cleaning up rubble from a big rig whose driver thought doing a 180 on the freeway and smashing into the center divider was a keen idea.

Being a good American (I did vote, after all), I thought it was my right to get out of my car (traffic was stopped) and walk up and investigate the accident scene to see if I could get some sort of personal satisfaction out of the situation (voyeuristic tendencies aren't so bad, are they?).

As I stood there, wondering if any cars had driven head first into the big rig, a tow truck pulled up carrying a small blue car that had plowed straight into the rig. Imagine my satisfaction! Not only did they instantly answer my question, they also brought the crumpled vehicle over so I could get a closer look. A big thumbs up!

Another observation; eastbound traffic, the side on which the accident took place, was not stopped. Three lanes were open for traffic to drive over all kinds of neat broken glass, fiberglass and various other car bits. We, the westbound side, had to wait until they cleared the center divider portions out of our lanes before we could proceed. Glass is good, rocks are bad.

Soon enough, but not until after I had made two phone calls (<i>""HEY! Guess where I am! No! Guess again!""</i>), the road was deemed clear and we were able to resume our lives as though the accident had never happened.

Sadly, I did not see any mangled bodies or car fires. That was the last time I was stuck on a freeway. That's a story for a different day, though. A story that involved helicopters and corpses."

Does anyone really expect the mindless masses living a life of convenience instead of actual freedom of thought and action to realize how bad things are? Things have to get so much worse before this nation that is spoonfed medicimal bullshit from the media will ever truly see how shitty the many aspects of this life are.

But, seriously, how do we know that it has ever been better? Because our teachers told us? Because we saw movies that were made about how romantic and wonderful the past was? I don't know that it was ever better. The freedom that the majority of us have is so very limited. We still need to conform to the tedious constrictions of the life that our forefathers lived and laid out for us.

We may have more liberties than most other countries in the world, but we really aren't that free. We never have been.

It's easy to not see the reality of it all if you have never wanted better in the truest of senses.

I have nothing but good things to say about the experience. Yes, we worked for free, but never have I been made to feel so appreciated at a haunt. Everyone involved was great to work with. The crew sends people through every 20 minutes or so to see how we are doing, if we need water, etc. I thought the place was very gracious to let us come in so late in the run, let us have our own room together, and just encourage us to have fun and work.

Yeah, like I said, we worked for free. It seems funny to me. So often at Haunt I heard people say that they love the job so much that they would work it for free. I would never do that at Knotts. At the Vineyard, though, it was a pleasure to donate my time and energy.

After an experience like this, I really don't know if I would want to work in an environment like Knotts again.

I'll probably work at least two more nights for them this week. I would do more but my schedule doesn't really allow it.

...but I must admit to some guilty pleasure in scaring the shit out of some of the Haunt folks that went through, and tormenting some others who had no idea at all who I was. Can't wait to see the Haunted Media video. I usually hate working for cameras, but I had no problem doing my part to help make this place look as good as it can. Fun scares tonight, too, one involving a very disturbed/almost catatonic child who took about five minutes to walk through the piggy room. I hope that kid has nightmares.

Oh, yeah, and I got to hump the shit out of Foamie."

A quick look at my thoughts on Haunt (saying all that needs to be said):

I don't care. I realized that I was giving Haunt more than Haunt gave me. I don't care enough to contact HR. I don't care enough to whine in newsgroups. I just don't care. I'll probably go, though. Maybe. ...<i>and that's it.</i>

In other news: things are good. Pepper Ranch!"

so, post-op, greta is doing better. she's eating more and is active, i just need to get her weight up. so, what happens? smeagol's stitches popped. you want to know what that looks like? you know when you slice a hot dog down the middle to cook it on a pan? that's how my dog's dick looks. scott and i gave him a clean the wound and butterfly bandage makeover. his ding-ding is looking cleaner, but it's still pretty scary. did i mention the puss? it's super. monday morning my broke-dick dog is going back to the vet, and tuesday morning i board a plane. i'm not happy about having to leave the dogs when they aren't in the greatest of health, though.

"event","having one of those evenings were everything seems to explode as soon as i touch it. it's getting me a bit touchy, but as the night winds down things seem to be calming and i'm feeling fine.

got my gameboy for the trip to ny. gbasp classic edition for a fine low rate of fiddy dolla. mmm hmmmm. it's the first gameboy i've had since the original b&w chump.

the dogs are doing better. getting greta to eat is a bit of a chore. i hope she's watched over properly while i'm away.

in general, bleeuaaahhahaaaaarrrrrrrrg."
